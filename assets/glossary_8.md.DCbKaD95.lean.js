First established in 1852 as a gold-mining town, today Daylesford has a population of 2,548 as of the 2016 census. As one of Australia‚Äôs few spa towns, Daylesford is a notable tourist destination. The town‚Äôs numerous spas, restaurants and galleries are popular alongside the many gardens and country-house-conversion styled bed and breakfasts. The broader area around the town, including Hepburn Springs to the north, is known for its natural spring mineral spas and is the location of over 80 per cent of Australia's effervescent mineral water reserve. It is also the filming location for the 3rd season of The Saddle Club. History J. Tenseld, Main Street, Daylesford, 1862, State Library of Victoria Prior to European settlement the area was occupied by the Djadja Wurrung people. Pastoralists occupied the Jim Crow and Upper Loddon districts following white settlement in 1838. In 1848, Irish immigrant John Egan took up land on the future town site then known as Wombat Flat. He and a party of searchers found alluvial gold in 1851 on ground now covered by Lake Daylesford initiating the local gold rush. Other finds quickly followed. With the finding of alluvial gold a town site was surveyed and founded in 1852. Initially called Wombat, it was renamed Daylesford. In 1859 around 3400 diggers were on the local diggings. The post office opened on 1 February 1858 and a telegraph office was opened in August 1859. Daylesford was declared a municipality in 1859 and a borough in the early 1860s. By the 1860s the alluvial gold was exhausted and a shift to quartz reef mining began. This continued on and off into the 1930s. In later years Daylesford became associated as being a fashionable spa resort, but fell out of favour in the Great Depression. The Daylesford Magistrates' Court closed on 1 January 1990. Climate At above sea level, it has a cooler, wetter climate than Melbourne. Summer (January‚ÄìFebruary) temperatures range from , while July temperatures are cold, ranging from about to . Annual precipitation, occasionally falling as snow, averages about but has ranged from to over per year. Economy Lake Daylesford Aerial panorama of Lake Daylesford in summer, 2018. With 65 mineral springs, the Daylesford-Hepburn Springs region accounts for more than 80 per cent of Australia‚Äôs known mineral water springs. As a result, the region has a number of spa developments including Hepburn Bathhouse & Spa, Mineral Spa at Peppers Springs Retreat and Salus Spa, Lake House. The town is also known for hosting a number of annual events, including the ChillOut Festival held during the Victorian Labour Day long weekend in March each year, the largest gay and lesbian festival in rural and regional Australia; the Harvest Week Festival; the Lavandula's Festivals; and the Hepburn Springs Swiss Italian Festival celebrating the town's Swiss- Italian heritage. Major industries in the economy of Daylesford today are healthcare, accommodation and food, and retail trade respectively. Education Daylesford State School (b. 1875) post card The town is served by a number of primary schools and one public secondary school, Daylesford Secondary College. The town's Secondary College was originally established as a mining school, in 1890. In 1961 the college was established as the sole provider of secondary education in the Shire of Hepburn and has just over 500 pupils. Daylesford Primary School, formerly known as Daylesford State School, is the oldest and longest-running provider of primary education in Daylesford. Other primary schools in the area include St. Michael's Primary School and Daylesford Dharma School. Daylesford Primary School is host to an annual book fair which first started in 2010 and has since begun operating as an annual book fair, where used and unwanted books are donated to raise funds that go towards improving children's literacy. Transport Aerial perspective of Daylesford Boathouse The Midland Highway runs directly through the town linking it with Castlemaine in the north and Ballarat in the south-west. The Western Freeway is the main route linking Daylesford to the state capital. The railway to the town closed in 1978. The railway layout at Daylesford station was unusual in that the lines from Creswick and Carlsruhe both entered the station from the same end.http://www.signaldiagramsandphotos.com/My_Web_pages/VR/Northern_&_Midland/9'46.htm The Daylesford Spa Country Railway currently operates a Sunday tourist service to Musk and Bullarto along the line towards Carlsruhe. Sport The town has an Australian Rules football team competing in the Central Highlands Football League. Daylesford is also home to the Daylesford and Hepburn United Soccer Club also known as the Saints or the Sainters. The Saints have won four league titles in their 20-year history along with two cup finals.

It is one of Canada's most famous golf courses and is home to the Golf Canada and the Canadian Golf Hall of Fame. It has hosted 30 Canadian Open Championships, more than any other course, with the first having been in 1977. It was the first solo design by Jack Nicklaus in 1976. A distinguishing feature of the Glen Abbey course are the \\"Valley Holes\\", numbered 11 through 15. On number 11, a par 4, players tee off a cliff to a fairway that is approximately 60 feet below on the valley floor. The second shot must clear Sixteen Mile Creek to the green. Holes 12, 13 and 14 all use Sixteen Mile Creek as a hazard of one form or another. Number 15 is a short par 3 with a sharply-sloping green, after which players climb out of the valley to the 16th hole. Glen Abbey is owned by Clublink, operated by TWC Enterprises Limited. The company is planning to demolish the golf course in order to build residential and commercial units. The plan is opposed by the Oakville Town Council, which has designated the facility a heritage site. In 2018, the company achieved some success in its efforts against the town after a Superior Court ruled against the town's attempts to block its plan. History The property Glen Abbey is situated on was previously owned by a number of groups before it was made into a golf club. The land was originally patented to King's College (the predecessor to the University of Toronto) in 1814. In 1937, the property was sold to Andre Dorfman, as a private estate. In 1953, the property was sold to the Jesuit Fathers of Upper Canada, and was used as a retreat. From 1963 to 1974, the property was sold to another developer, who first attempted to develop the property into a gentlemen's club and golf course; and later into a ski hill. Nick Price at the 1994 Canadian Open at Glen Abbey Golf Club. In 1974, the property was sold to another developer, who developed the property into the present golf course. In 1975, the Royal Canadian Golf Association relocated its headquarters and the Canadian Golf Hall of Fame to the golf club the following year. Two years later, the course hosted its first Canadian Open. The golf club is presently a rota course of the Canadian Open, hosting the event 30 times since 1977. The Royal Canadian Golf Association purchased the club in 1990 and sold it to Clublink in 1999. The 18th hole is notable due to its connection to Tiger Woods, who, in the final round of the 2000 Canadian Open, hit a six-iron shot 218 yards from a bunker on the right side of the fairway to about 18 feet from the hole. The shot was over a large pond that guards the green. In doing so, Woods proceeded to defeat his playing partner Grant Waite and won the tournament. The shot is regarded as one of the most spectacular both of Woods' career and in recent PGA Tour history. In 2009, Mark Calcavecchia set a new PGA Tour record with 9 consecutive birdies in his second round of the Canadian Open. After having started the round on the 10th hole, he birdied holes 12 through 18, then holes 1 and 2 of the front nine. Redevelopment plan Glen Abbey's golf course in November 2016. Clublink Corp first filed an application in October 2015 to redevelop the property. In its plan, there was no provision for a golf course. The Town of Oakville Council responded in August 2017 by declaring the golf course a heritage site under the Ontario Heritage Act. This would make it more difficult for Clublink to develop the area as it had planned, with 3,222 housing units. 69,000 square feet of commercial/retail space and 107,000 square feet of office space. Golf Canada was also concerned, since they could not predict whether it could get the necessary permit to hold the Canadian Open at Glen Abbey in 2018. Eventually, the event was in fact held at Glen Abbey. The Town of Oakville formally rejected the plan to demolish the golf course in a unanimous vote by the Planning and Development Council on February 12, 2018. In summer 2018, Clublink was awaiting a Superior Court decision on its plan to request a demolition permit and, in the meantime, the Canadian Open took place at the course. On October 25, 2018, Justice Edward Morgan ruled that Clublink had a right to take its demolition application to the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal (LPAT), in spite of the town's previous denial of this step. The city council subsequently voted unanimously to take the issue to the Ontario Court of Appeal. On December 11, 2018, the Ontario Superior Court ruled against the conservation plan and bylaws which had been enacted to stop the Glen Abbey development plan. Judge Edward Morgan said that the effort exceeded the town's legal rights and was made in bad faith. The Local Planning Appeal Tribunal (LPAT) will hold an eight-day hearing in June 2019 on ClubLink‚Äôs appeal of the town‚Äôs updated official plan and amended bylaws and later in 2019, another hearing later about ClubLink‚Äôs development application appeal. A report at the time of the October 2018 hearing clarified the owner's plan: building \\"3,222 residential units, including nine apartment buildings between nine and 12 storeys in height\\". These would be over and above the planned office space and commercial/retail space. The 2019 and 2023 Canadian Open were scheduled to be held at the Hamilton Golf and Country Club but the event may again be held at Glen Abbey in some future years if the redevelopment is not allowed to proceed.

The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 3,662. Leicester city centre is about seven miles north west. Its name comes from the original Iron Age settlers who used the Celtic word glennos meaning valley, and comes from the fact that Great Glen lies in part of the valley of the River Sence. The 'great' part is to distinguish the village from Glen Parva. Features and amenities In 1751 a turnpike bridge was built over the River Sence as a part of the stagecoach route from Leicester to London. The pubs The Pug & Greyhound (The Old Greyhound) and The Crown were originally coaching inns built soon after the new road opened. This road later became the A6 road, and a bypass around the village was opened in 2003. The Midland Main Line runs to the south of the A6, and formerly had a station to serve the village at the closest point. Great Glen disused station Leicester Grammar School is constructed on the land of Mount Farm, Great Glen There are two other schools in the village, the C of E St Cuthbert's primary school, which feeds to the local state schools in the neighbouring village of Kibworth and the town of Market Harborough. The independent school, The Stoneygate School, also has its site at Great Glen. Its pupils recently won Best Junior Choir at BBC Songs of Praise 2005 School Choirs Contest There are now only four pubs surviving in the village - The Yews, The Royal Oak, Fox Pond and The Pug & Greyhound (formerly The Greyhound). The village park, The Recreation Ground on Bindleys Lane is the home of two of the villages sports clubs, Glen Villa FC and Great Glen Cricket Club. At the centre of the village on the Stretton Road/Oaks Road T-junction is Great Glen Methodist Church, a Grade II* listed building. Built in 1827 it houses many activities including Sunday morning and evening services, a Sparklers mums and toddlers group on Mondays, Fusion children's group on Sunday mornings and Confusion alternate Friday evenings for teenagers. View the church at The village is serviced by a Post Office and a Co-op store. The K6 Red telephone box on the village green is a listed building. Footballer Trevor Benjamin used to live here and Engelbert Humperdinck has a home in the village. Stretton Hall Stretton Hall was built in the early 18th century, and though named after Stretton Magna it lies in Great Glen parish. It was built as the manor house of the lordship of Stretton, by, or for, the Hewett family: it was the English residence of Colonel William Hewett (1693-1766), friend of the famous Marquess of Granby, of the novelist Laurence Sterne, and of the eccentric John Hall-Stevenson and his \\"Club of Demoniacs\\". Hewett set acorns all over his estate to create a plantation of oaks, some of which were disposed to form a double colonnade like that in front of St Peter's in Rome.J.

Under the NHS it was a residential hospital for learning disabled children and had 157 beds in 1979.Index of English and Welsh Lunatic Asylums and Mental Hospitals, A. Roberts, Middlesex University. The hospital closed in the 1990s and a housing development has been built on part of the site. History Great Glen was the central place of an early Anglo-Saxon multiple estate. The settlements that comprised this estate are: Great and Little Stretton, Wistow, Newton Harcourt, Fleckney and Kilby. These parishes comprise the minimal extent of the estate which broadly follow the River Sence, the earlier name of which was Glen or Glennos, which was an earlier name of the river. It is possible that the estate extended further west along the river to Glen Parva where it joins the River Soar. It has not been possible to establish this securely. Glen (not Great Glen) enters the record for the first time in AD849 in an Anglo-Saxon royal charter.Anglo Saxon Charter 849 AD for aet Glenne In the 16th century, Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk, father of Lady Jane Grey, became the lord of the manor. After his execution for treason, his lands were seized by the crown. Following the Battle of Naseby in 1645, during the English Civil War, Great Glen played host to a band of Cromwellian soldiers who were pursuing some of the (defeated) Royalist Cavalry. They were later joined by the rest of the army who camped overnight before moving onto Leicester. Some of these soldiers made camp in the church where they caused much damage (such as breaking all the windows), of which some evidence can still be seen today. There are five road names in the village that mark these events: Cromwell Road, Naseby Way, Ruperts Way, Edgehill Close and Halford Close. The old public house, The Fox and Goose, is still visible on Church Lane but has been converted to a private residence.

Founded in 1945, it was located at the university-owned Willard Airport in Savoy, Illinois, United States. The institute was the first school in the U.S. to be certified by the Federal Aviation Administration to conduct all tests leading to the issuance of civilian pilot certificates. It had a long history of providing flight training, and was particularly well known for conducting research into aviation-related human factors. For training purposes, the institute maintained a fleet of 18 Piper Archers, 7 Piper Arrows, 3 twin- engine Piper Seminoles and two Cessna 152s.  2010 review of institute  The Institute of Aviation was placed under review by the University of Illinois in the spring of 2010. The university faced a major budget shortfall, and was owed $431 million by the state of Illinois. Closing the institute was proposed as a means of cutting costs.  Closure of institute/transfer to Parkland College  On July 21, 2011 university trustees voted 6‚Äì2 to close the institute by the 2013‚Äì14 academic year, allowing current students to finish. This vote marked the end of over 60 years on campus for the institute. In the year prior to the institute's closure, there were fewer than 160 students, 34 of those were freshmen. It was also said to be the smallest degree granting unit with \\"some of the highest costs\\" on campus. However, in September 2013, the university entered a three-year agreement with Parkland College in Champaign to transfer ownership of the institute to the community college for continued flight training. The Parkland College Institute of Aviation at the University of Illinois will allow students to earn a two-year associate degree in aviation or take courses to earn FAA-approved pilot certification to various levels. Leasing the university's aircraft and facilities at Willard Airport in Savoy, Parkland‚Äôs flight institute planned to open for the fall 2014 academic semester and began accepting applications at the end of March 2014.  Former programs of study  The Institute of Aviation offered a B.S. in Aviation Human Factors. This program of study focused on aircraft safety, accident prevention, and human factors psychology; the core curriculum was a mixture of flight and psychology courses. Through the flight courses, students could earn their private pilot certificate, commercial pilot certificate, instrument rating, and multi-engine rating. The psychology courses provided the students with an understanding of operator and machine interaction. Some university students were interested in flight training, but would prefer to pursue a degree in another field. For these students, the Professional Pilot program was an option. In this program, the students were able to earn their private pilot's certificate and instrument rating while still pursuing a non aviation degree. Students then transferred to a different college at the University of Illinois in order to complete their bachelor's degree.  Former courses offered  The following is a list of both flight and non-flight course options that were offered by the institute for the 2009‚Äì10 school year. For the current course options, they are listed in the Parkland College catalog excerpt as well as in the previous paragraph regarding the transfer of the institute and the new program.http://www.parkland.edu/Media/Website%20Resources/PDF/academics/aviation/Aviation- degree.pdf  References  External links  * * Parkland College Institute of Aviation at the University of Illinois Category:Educational institutions established in 1946 Category:1946 establishments in Illinois Category:University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign centers and institutes ","title":"University of Illinois Institute of Aviation"},{"id":"1504684","text":"De Camp, or DeCamp, or Decamp is a surname.

Although the first album, Derek and Clive (Live), was reasonably good-natured in its blasphemous subversiveness, Come Again was released at the height of the punk rock phenomenon and Cook, in particular, seems keen to elevate the excess to new heights of jaw-dropping offensiveness. To that end, he improvises routines about raping the victims of road traffic accidents and cross-dressing members of the aristocracy masturbating rent boys in taxi cabs, not to mention several extended routines on cancer in all its variations. Moore, on the other hand, improvises a smutty rhyme about his mother sucking his penis, oral sex performed in lavatory cubicles and how he masturbates with the aid of a greased toilet roll connected to his electric train-set. Throughout much of the album (recorded in just one day for a Christmas release), both Cook and especially Moore are drunk and out of control, with Moore in particular regularly collapsing in hysterics (Cook achieving his primary comic aim of making Moore laugh with regular ease). Shortly after the album's release, controversy unsurprisingly erupted in a variety of forms, most notably a petrol station attendant being fired from his job after it was discovered that he owned a copy of the album (Cook testified at the man's industrial tribunal), and a distributor of talking books accidentally sending out copies of Come Again on cassette in cases intended for the children's classic Black Beauty. The CD reissue adds several previously unreleased routines, including a sketch about Derek (Moore) cutting his wife's hymen out with an electric carving knife, and one of their most popular sketches amongst their fans, 'Mother', in which Moore plays Cooks hysterical, domineering, deranged mother. Like much of the extra material, it was actually recorded during the 'Ad Nauseam' sessions a couple of years later than the original Come Again album.

In 2007, he was honoured by the Sony Radio Academy with a Lifetime Achievement Award. Early career Tony Butler was born in Wolverhampton on 15 May 1935. He began his journalistic career in local papers in Birmingham before beginning to contribute to BBC national and regional radio in the 1960s. His strong regional accent caused problems at the staid BBC and he later recalled how he was encouraged to soften his natural accent. At one point the BBC even provided elocution lessons. BRMB In 1974, he was hired to be the first sports editor at Birmingham's new independent (i.e. non-BBC) radio station BRMB, one of a handful of commercial stations to launch at that time. With BRMB striving to offer something different from the established BBC radio stations, Butler was encouraged to act naturally on the air, emphasising rather than hiding his accent. After being sent on a tour of radio stations in Canada and the US, Butler noticed the success of the forthright North American broadcasters and, back in the UK, he began to develop a similar aggressive manner on the air, offering controversial opinions and arguing with callers to his shows. In another innovation imported from across the Atlantic, Butler began to offer sports fans the opportunity to call into his shows with their opinions of their teams' performances, giving birth to his boast that he was the inventor of the football phone-in. Butler's much repeated catchphrase \\"On 'yer bike\\" was used to cut off callers whose opinions he disagreed with, whilst his competitions would tax listeners with questions such as \\"How many yards of elastic are there in a golf ball?\\". During live coverage of football games, fans were encouraged to \\"get those prayer mats out\\" to help their ailing teams. Similar encouragement was offered through frequent playing of \\"The Butler Theme Tune\\" (in reality Hurricane Smith's \\"Theme from an Unmade Silent Movie\\"). Butler's outspokenness and unique radio shows soon made him one of Birmingham's most recognised voices. It helped that the late 1970s and early 80s were a particularly good time for local sport, with five of the West Midlands' teams enjoying top flight football. Butler and his team of reporters were also able to cover memorable European campaigns for Aston Villa, West Bromwich Albion and Wolverhampton Wanderers. Well known locally, Butler's abrasive style was also brought to national attention after being worked into the routines of Birmingham comic Jasper Carrott, who often liked to poke fun at the homespun nature of BRMB's programming at the time. In 1984, Butler was sacked from BRMB after a row with fellow broadcaster Brian Savin, who is disabled. Savin had sent a note to Butler complaining about coverage of a cricket match over-running into his show; Butler was said to have found the content of the note offensive and confronted Savin, pulling him out of his chair during the ensuing argument. The dismissal of such a high-profile personality was front-page news in Birmingham, and programmes on BRMB were severely affected as some of Butler's former colleagues walked out on strike. Butler later commented that the matter had been blown out of all proportion, claiming that he remained friends with Savin. He preferred to attribute the sacking to a general falling-out with BRMB management. BBC Following his sacking, Butler was snapped up more or less immediately by the BBC local TV news programme \\"Midlands Today\\" often reporting on the lighter items and demonstrating a much softer side to his nature than anyone had hitherto seen. He also presented his successful local TV shows \\"Sporting Butler\\", \\"Boating Butler\\" and \\"Biking Butler\\", travelling around the region meeting people with an interesting story to tell. In 1987, Tony Inchley was appointed Manager of ailing BBC Radio WM, at a time when the BBC was under pressure from the government to justify its provision of local radio services. Inchley swiftly revamped the BBC station's output, hiring a number of personalities and recruiting Butler to restart his Friday night football phone-in in direct competition with BRMB's George Gavin, Butler's former deputy. Butler was subsequently promoted to host the prestigious breakfast show, replacing Ed Doolan, (who then began his hugely popular lunchtime show). Under Butler, Radio WM's breakfast show was a mix of current affairs, information and phone- in competitions, the presenter able to show his versatility switching from interviewing politicians to chatting with callers. He gave away egg cups and mugs to the same callers week in week out. He continued to host the Friday night football phone-in. Butler was still unable to shake off his controversial image though; in 1989 Radio WM's reporters found themselves banned from covering Wolverhampton Wanderers games after the club accused Butler of making racist comments about one of their black players, Shane Westley. When Tony Inchley announced his retirement Butler felt his time was up, so he decided to leave. Xtra AM In 1994 Butler moved back to commercial radio, hosting the breakfast show on BRMB spin-off station Xtra-AM, giving him the opportunity to play more music. During this time he also co- hosted Xtra's Friday night football phone-in, along with sports editor Tom Ross. Back to the BBC The purchase of Xtra-AM by the Capital Radio group saw the end to most of the locally produced programming, and so in 1998, Butler made his way back to Radio WM. Firstly, presenting a Saturday lunchtime show, before taking over his current Monday ‚Äì Thursday evening football phone- in show from 7 to 8pm and the Sportsnight show on Mondays from 8 to 10pm. Birmingham Live TV In 1998 Butler joined local cable TV station Birmingham Live TV, a regional affiliate of MGN's L!VE TV. As part of the sports team, he presented the local sports bulletins on the channel, as well as going out to interview sporting figures across the West Midlands. He also hosted a live phone-in show on the channel every Friday night called 'Butler's Sports Special'. He remained at Birmingham Live until its closure in November 1999. Controversy at BBC West Midlands Tony Butler courted additional controversy on a BBC West Midlands radio programme, broadcast on 28 March 2007. He stated that women should not be in war zones and, commenting on kidnapped British sailor Faye Turney, said that were she decapitated, \\"it would serve her right.\\" His outburst prompted a barrage of complaints from listeners, and led the BBC to issue an apology. Retirement Butler announced in April 2009, that he would retire at the end of the 2008/2009 football season, commenting \\"I think you know when it's time to retire, and I'm on my bike.\\" Return to Commercial Radio In August 2009, it was announced by Tom Ross that Butler would be returning to the Gold airwaves to co-host the football phone in on Friday nights on Gold. The announcement was made within days of Orion taking control of BRMB and Gold. It is believed that Butler will be a regular fixture of their expanded coverage during the 2009/10 season. In August 2012, it was announced by Tom Ross that Butler had finally ended his broadcasting career due to ill-health. Ross paid tribute to Butler in an emotional telephone interview with his predecessor on his opening football phone in show of the 2012/2013 season; thanking him for bring him to BRMB over thirty years before.

It is 43 kilometre south of Cochin city and 21 kilometre north of Alleppey town. It is a rapidly developing satellite town of Kochi. Arthunkal lies in the taluk of Cherthala, which is in turn a part of the district of Alleppey. Religious significance=Pilgrimage site Arthunkal is one of the most important pilgrimage sites in Kerala. It is considered as a holy land by hundreds of thousands of devotees, of Christian as well as other faith. The village is synonymous for its church, which has the Roman martyr Saint Sebastian as its patron. The feast of St. Sebastian in Arthunkal is a grand celebration extending for two weeks in January. While the main day of the traditional feast or the perunnal is on January 20, the church authorities have instituted another on January 27, to mark the end of celebrations, locally referred to as Ettamperunnal or 'the 8th day of the feast'. Devotees from all across the state visit the church on the feast days. A procession, carrying the graceful statue of St. Sebastian, from the church to the beach and back, is the most important event of the feast. An eagle is seen roaming the skies, every year during the time of the procession. This eagle too has become part of the grandmother stories, about the presence of St. Sebastian as a guardian saint for the village. Thanksgiving Many devotees, who recovered from serious illness or closely escaped accidents, often visit this pilgrim site to offer thanks to St. Sebastian. It is believed that the saint has powers to heal the maimed, crippled and those with mental disorders. Thus many disabled people also visit the shrine. Devotees often express gratitude by crawling on their knees, known as Urulunercha,http://arthunkal.bizhat.com on the road from the beach to the church, and make offerings - small metal replicas of bows and arrows. St. Andrew's Basilica, Arthunkal The church, officially St. Andrew's Basilica, Arthunkal, was originally built by the Portuguese missionaries in the 16th century. It has a fascinating history.http://gallery.bizhat.com/showgallery.php?cat=1659 The church was rebuilt in 1584, under the then vicar Fr. Jacoma Fenicio, whom the devotees claim, possessed magical powers to heal the body and mind. Devotees fondly referred to him as Arthunkal Veluthachan, which in English translates to fair skinned father. Fr. Fenicio died in 1632. Eight years after his death, the church was rebuilt again, this time facing the west towards the long white- sand beach on the shores of the Arabian Sea. In 1647, the statue of St. Sebastian, struck with arrows all over his bleeding body (he was executed at the order of the Roman emperor for embracing Christian faith) sculptured in Milan, was brought and placed in the Arthunkal church. Arthunkal St Andrews Forane Church, the first Parish of the Diocese of Alleppey has been elevated to the status of Basilica on 9 July 2010. Arthunkal Basilica is the first Basilica in the diocese of Alleppey and the 7th Basilica in Kerala. It is the 3rd Basilica on the Roman Catholic(Latin Rite) church of Kerala. Facilities A large open space between the St Francis Assisi Higher Secondary school and the church, is the heart of Arthunkal. The school, with buildings sprinkled on both side of the road that leads from the church to the beach. The village also has a fairly equipped hospital, a nursing school, a Teacher Training Institute, a Central School, One English medium school( Fr. Xavier Aresseril Memorial English Medium School CBSE. It is under the management of a Trust named Aresseril Educational And Charitable Trust Reethapuram, Arthunkal ), and a small shopping center near the school comprising about two dozen shops leased by the church to local businessmen. State Bank of India, Alleppey District Cooperative Bank and Arthunkal Village Service Cooperative Bank are major Banks in this place. The church owns bulk of the non-resident land-bank in the village. There is another church in the village, which hosts St. George as its patron saint, about half-mile away from the Arthunkal Basilica. A fishing harbour is also being built in Arthunkal. The theeradesa highway or the coastal highway, is expected to better connect the seaside villages of Alappuzha, including Arthunkal, with suburban Kochi.

An EFIS normally consists of a primary flight display (PFD), multi-function display (MFD), and an engine indicating and crew alerting system (EICAS) display. Early EFIS models used cathode ray tube (CRT) displays, but liquid crystal displays (LCD) are now more common. The complex electromechanical attitude director indicator (ADI) and horizontal situation indicator (HSI) were the first candidates for replacement by EFIS. Now, however, few flight deck instruments cannot be replaced by an electronic display.  Display units = Primary flight display (PFD)  On the flight deck, the display units are the most obvious parts of an EFIS system, and are the features that lead to the term glass cockpit. The display unit that replaces the artificial horizon is called the primary flight display (PFD). If a separate display replaces the HSI, it is called the navigation display. The PFD displays all information critical to flight, including calibrated airspeed, altitude, heading, attitude, vertical speed and yaw. The PFD is designed to improve a pilot's situational awareness by integrating this information into a single display instead of six different analog instruments, reducing the amount of time necessary to monitor the instruments. PFDs also increase situational awareness by alerting the aircrew to unusual or potentially hazardous conditions -- for example, low airspeed, high rate of descent -- by changing the color or shape of the display or by providing audio alerts. The names Electronic Attitude Director Indicator and Electronic Horizontal Situation Indicator are used by some manufacturers.Primary flight display and navigation display are the names used in the Federal Aviation Administration Advisory Circulars and also in ARINC Specification 725 However, a simulated ADI is only the centerpiece of the PFD. Additional information is both superimposed on and arranged around this graphic. Multi-function displays can render a separate navigation display unnecessary. Another option is to use one large screen to show both the PFD and navigation display. The PFD and navigation display (and multi-function display, where fitted) are often physically identical. The information displayed is determined by the system interfaces where the display units are fitted. Thus, spares holding is simplified: the one display unit can be fitted in any position. LCD units generate less heat than CRTs; an advantage in a congested instrument panel. They are also lighter, and occupy a lower volume.  Multi-function display (MFD)  The navigation display (ND) of a Boeing 747-400 aircraft The MFD (multi-function display) displays navigational and weather information from multiple systems. MFDs are most frequently designed as \\"chart-centric\\", where the aircrew can overlay different information over a map or chart. Examples of MFD overlay information include the aircraft's current route plan, weather information from either on-board radar or lightning detection sensors or ground-based sensors, e.g., NEXRAD, restricted airspace and aircraft traffic. The MFD can also be used to view other non- overlay type of data (e.g., current route plan) and calculated overlay-type data, e.g., the glide radius of the aircraft, given current location over terrain, winds, and aircraft speed and altitude. MFDs can also display information about aircraft systems, such as fuel and electrical systems (see EICAS, below). As with the PFD, the MFD can change the color or shape of the data to alert the aircrew to hazardous situations.  Engine indications and crew alerting system (EICAS) / electronic centralized aircraft monitoring (ECAM) EICAS (Engine Indications and Crew Alerting System) displays information about the aircraft's systems, including its fuel, electrical and propulsion systems (engines). EICAS displays are often designed to mimic traditional round gauges while also supplying digital readouts of the parameters. EICAS improves situational awareness by allowing the aircrew to view complex information in a graphical format and also by alerting the crew to unusual or hazardous situations. For example, if an engine begins to lose oil pressure, the EICAS might sound an alert, switch the display to the page with the oil system information and outline the low oil pressure data with a red box. Unlike traditional round gauges, many levels of warnings and alarms can be set. Proper care must be taken when designing EICAS to ensure that the aircrew are always provided with the most important information and not overloaded with warnings or alarms. ECAM is a similar system used by Airbus, which in addition to providing EICAS functions also recommend remedial action. A 737NG EICAS after landing, showing outside air temperature, N1 RPM, exhaust gas temperature, N2 RPM, fuel flow, fuel used, fuel in the tanks, oil pressure, oil temperature, oil quantity, engine vibration, hydraulic pressure and hydraulic quantity  Control panels  EFIS provides pilots with controls that select display range and mode (for example, map or compass rose) and enter data (such as selected heading). Where other equipment uses pilot inputs, data buses broadcast the pilot's selections so that the pilot need only enter the selection once. For example, the pilot selects the desired level-off altitude on a control unit. The EFIS repeats this selected altitude on the PFD, and by comparing it with the actual altitude (from the air data computer) generates an altitude error display. This same altitude selection is used by the automatic flight control system to level off, and by the altitude alerting system to provide appropriate warnings.  Data processors  The EFIS visual display is produced by the symbol generator. This receives data inputs from the pilot, signals from sensors, and EFIS format selections made by the pilot. The symbol generator can go by other names, such as display processing computer, display electronics unit, etc. The symbol generator does more than generate symbols. It has (at the least) monitoring facilities, a graphics generator and a display driver.This driver is hardware, not software! Inputs from sensors and controls arrive via data buses, and are checked for validity. The required computations are performed, and the graphics generator and display driver produce the inputs to the display units.  Capabilities  Like personal computers, flight instrument systems need power-on-self-test facilities and continuous self-monitoring. Flight instrument systems, however, need additional monitoring capabilities: *Input validation -- verify that each sensor is providing valid data *Data comparison -- cross check inputs from duplicated sensors *Display monitoring -- detect failures within the instrument system  Former practice  Traditional (electromechanical) displays are equipped with synchro mechanisms that transmit the pitch, roll, and heading shown on the captain and first officer's instruments to an instrument comparator. The comparator warns of excessive differences between the Captain and First Officer displays. Even a fault as far downstreamDownstream and upstream refer to the direction of data flow: from sensor, to processor, to display as a jam in, say, the roll mechanism of an ADI triggers a comparator warning. The instrument comparator thus provides both comparator monitoring and display monitoring.  Comparator monitoring  With EFIS, the comparator function is simple: Is roll data (bank angle) from sensor 1 the same as roll data from sensor 2? If not, display a warning caption (such as CHECK ROLL) on both PFDs. Comparison monitors give warnings for airspeed, pitch, roll, and altitude indications. More advanced EFIS systems have more comparator monitors.  Display monitoring  In this technique, each symbol generator contains two display monitoring channels. One channel, the internal, samples the output from its own symbol generator to the display unit and computes, for example, what roll attitude should produce that indication. This computed roll attitude is then compared with the roll attitude input to the symbol generator from the INS or AHRS. Any difference has probably been introduced by faulty processing, and triggers a warning on the relevant display. The external monitoring channel carries out the same check on the symbol generator on the other side of the flight deck: the Captain's symbol generator checks the First Officer's, the First Officer's checks the Captain's. Whichever symbol generator detects a fault, puts up a warning on its own display. The external monitoring channel also checks sensor inputs (to the symbol generator) for reasonableness. A spurious input, such as a radio height greater than the radio altimeter's maximum, results in a warning.  Human factors = Clutter  At various stages of a flight, a pilot needs different combinations of data. Ideally, the avionics only show the data in use‚Äîbut an electromechanical instrument must be in view all the time. To improve display clarity, ADIs and HSIs use intricate mechanisms to remove superfluous indications temporarily‚Äîe.g., removing the glide slope scale when the pilot doesn't need it. Under normal conditions, an EFIS might not display some indications, e.g., engine vibration. Only when some parameter exceeds its limits does the system display the reading. In similar fashion, EFIS is programmed to show the glideslope scale and pointer only during an ILS approach. In the case of an input failure, an electromechanical instrument adds yet another indicator‚Äîtypically, a bar drops across the erroneous data. EFIS, on the other hand, removes invalid data from the display and substitutes an appropriate warning. A de-clutter mode activates automatically when circumstances require the pilot's attention for a specific item. For example, if the aircraft pitches up or down beyond a specified limit‚Äîusually 30 to 60 degrees‚Äîthe attitude indicator de-clutters other items from sight until the pilot brings the pitch to an acceptable level. This helps the pilot focus on the most important tasks.  Color  Traditional instruments have long used color, but lack the ability to change a color to indicate some change in condition. The electronic display technology of EFIS has no such restriction and uses color widely. For example, as an aircraft approaches the glide slope, a blue caption can indicate glide slope is armed, and capture might change the color to green. Typical EFIS systems color code the navigation needles to reflect the type of navigation. Green needles indicate ground-based navigation, such as VORs, Localizers and ILS systems. Magenta needles indicate GPS navigation.  Advantages  EFIS provides versatility by avoiding some physical limitations of traditional instruments. A pilot can switch the same display that shows a course deviation indicator to show the planned track provided by an area navigation or flight management system. Pilots can choose to superimpose the weather radar picture on the displayed route. The flexibility afforded by software modifications minimises the costs of responding to new aircraft regulations and equipment. Software updates can update an EFIS system to extend its capabilities. Updates introduced in the 1990s included the ground proximity warning system and traffic collision avoidance system. A degree of redundancy is available even with the simple two-screen EFIS installation. Should the PFD fail, transfer switching repositions its vital information to the screen normally occupied by the navigation display.  Advances in EFIS  In the late 1980s, EFIS became standard equipment on most Boeing and Airbus airliners, and many business aircraft adopted EFIS in the 1990s. Recent advances in computing power and reductions in the cost of liquid-crystal displays and navigational sensors (such as GPS and attitude and heading reference system) have brought EFIS to general aviation aircraft. Notable examples are the Garmin G1000 and Chelton Flight Systems EFIS-SV. Several EFIS manufacturers have focused on the experimental aircraft market, producing EFIS and EICAS systems for as little as US$1,000-2000. The low cost is possible because of steep drops in the price of sensors and displays, and equipment for experimental aircraft doesn't require expensive Federal Aviation Administration certification. This latter point restricts their use to experimental aircraft and certain other aircraft categories, depending on local regulations. Uncertified EFIS systems are also found in Light-sport aircraft, including factory built, microlight, and ultralight aircraft. These systems can be fitted to certified aircraft in some cases as secondary or backup systems depending on local aviation rules.

The party's main support comes from in and around that town of Halabjah. In the region controlled by the Islamic Movement in Kurdistan, the party established its own infrastructure but did not seek to apply Sharia law. Sheikh Uthman Abd al-Aziz was appointed as a mufti (religious judge) by the Islamic Movement of Kurdistan. In the 1992 Kurdistan Region parliamentary election, the party received 5.1% of the vote, the third largest after the PUK and KDP. In 1993 the PUK ceded control of territory around Halabja, Tawella and Panjwin to the party after heavy fighting, and the party controlled Halabjah from 1998 to 2000. In 1998 al-Aziz moved to Irbil with a number of followers. After Abdal-Aziz's death in 1999 the leadership of the party passed to his brother Mullah Ali Abd al-Aziz Halabji, who has his office in Halabjah. Armed hostilities, which resulted in deaths were reported between the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, Islamic Groups, Kurdistan Workers Party, and the Kurdistan Democratic Party. The heaviest fighting began in September 2001, when a newly created Islamist group, the Ansar al-Islam, seized control of some villages near the Iranian border and attempted to institute a strictly Islamist theocratic regime. According to press and opposition reporting, the Ansar al-Islam attacked Patriotic Union of Kurdistan fighters near Halabjah, killing dozens of persons. Intermittent fighting between the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, and the Ansar al-Islam, and other Islamic groups continued until late November, when an agreement between those involved and the Iranian Government imposed a cease-fire. Islamic Movement of Kurdistan holds (2005) two ministerial posts in the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan-dominated government. This co-operation appears to be principally a temporary coalition dictated by pragmatic considerations. Islamic Movement is receiving aid from Iran and is also said to receive money from other Islamic countries.

In 1909 the firm moved its headquarters to London. It was sold to Chase Manhattan Bank for over $7 billion in 2000. Flemings was a 50% partner in the Asian investment bank Jardine Fleming. History The firm of Robert Fleming & Co., known as Flemings, was founded in Dundee, Scotland in 1873 by Robert Fleming, a successful manufacturer of jute fabrics used for sandbags in the American Civil War. The firm was originally formed as a series of investment trusts, pooling money from Scottish investors into overseas ventures, and later moved into merchant banking. In 1909 the firm moved its headquarters to London. In 1873, Robert Fleming cofounded the Scottish American Investment Company for the purpose of investing in high risk, high return American railroad bonds. Flemings assumed a central role in the 1886 battle with Jay Gould for control of the Texas & Pacific Railway, in which the Flemings bondholder group ultimately triumphed. Overall, Flemings claimed to have made a 40% return on investments in US railroads.Quoting Fleming Family Partners partner Mark Graber in Gateway to Russia, 18 March 2002 In 1970, Flemings entered into an investment banking joint venture with Hong Kong-based Jardine Matheson, forming Jardine Fleming. Despite restructuring, Flemings saw its investment banking and asset management market share decline in the 1990s as global investment banks like Morgan Stanley and Lazard moved into their markets. The Fleming name was tarnished by a scandal in 1996, when Jardine Fleming was ordered to pay $19 million to fund investors for alleged abusive and unsupervised securities allocation practices by is asset management division. In April 2000, Robert Flemings Holdings was sold to Chase Manhattan Bank for $7.7 billion. Although the sale came about as partially as a result of Flemings‚Äô weakened position, it was part of two larger trends: consolidation in the financial services industry as large US commercial banks acquired investment banks upon the repeal of the Glass‚ÄìSteagall Act, and the sale of UK merchant banks to foreign banks. Flemings, with almost no US assets, was considered a particularly good fit for increasingly globally minded Chase, whose assets lay largely in the United States. In the sale about 130 Fleming family members pocketed approximately $2.3 billion for their thirty percent stake. When Chase merged with J.P. Morgan & Co. in 2001, the Flemings asset management business was rebranded J.P. Morgan Fleming, and Fleming Premier Banking was sold to Abbey National's Cater Allen subsidiary. Members of the Fleming family set up an asset management company, Fleming Family & Partners, which in November 2014 merged with Stonehage Group, an international family office with its roots in South Africa, to create Stonehage Fleming Family and Partners.

Since organic compounds do not react with H2, a special state of hydrogen was postulated. It is now understood that dissolving-metal reactions occur at the metal surface, and the concept of nascent hydrogen is discounted, and even ridiculed.  History  The idea of hydrogen in the nascent state having chemical properties different from those of molecular hydrogen was developed the mid-19th century. Alexander Williamson repeatedly refers to nascent hydrogen in his textbook Chemistry for Students, for example writing of the substitution reaction of carbon tetrachloride with hydrogen to form products such as chloroform and dichloromethane that the \\"hydrogen must for this purpose be in the nascent state, as free hydrogen does not produce the effect\\". Williamson also describes the use of nascent hydrogen in describing earlier work of Marcellin Berthelot. Franchot published a paper on the concept in 1896, which drew a strongly worded response from Tommasi who pointed to his own work that concluded \\"nascent hydrogen is nothing else than H + x calories\\".

Education Point is served by Sgoil an Rubha (Point School), a primary school which opened in 2011 in Bayble, built on the site of Bayble primary and junior secondary school. There was a long debate about the new school, leading to a gap of over 10 years between the first plans and the building of the school. The school took a year to build, and was the first of a number of new schools built in the Western Isles. There were three primary schools in Point: Bayble, Knock and Aird. These fed into Bayble junior secondary school, which closed when the new school opened, reflecting the decline in the school-age population. There is now no junior secondary school in Point; Sgoil an Rubha feeds into the Nicolson Institute in Stornoway for secondary education. History There are two historical sites of interest at the eastern end of the isthmus (Am Br√†ighe in Gaelic). The ruins of the Eye Church are all that remain of a building dedicated to St Columba. This was among the largest pre-Reformation Churches in the Western Isles. Although the present buildings are probably medieval, the Church is reputedly on the site of the cell of St Catan, a contemporary of St Columba. This is the burial ground of 19 of the Chiefs of the MacLeods of Lewis. There are two old carved commemorative slabs on the walls of the larger building: one depicts a warrior, believed to be Roderick, 7th Chief; while the other is Margaret, daughter of Roderick MacLeod of Lewis, who died in 1503. In recent years, the land reform struggle of the 19th century in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland is being recognised, and the Aignish Riots of 1888 are commemorated by a memorial adjacent to the Eye Church.

July 4, 1844 ‚Äì September 17, 1907), was an African American sculptor, of mixed African-American and Native American (Ojibwe) heritage. Born free in Upstate New York, she worked for most of her career in Rome, Italy. She was the first African-American sculptor to achieve national and then international prominence. She began to gain prominence in the United States during the Civil War; at the end of the 19th century, she remained the only Black woman artist who had participated in and been recognized to any extent by the American artistic mainstream. In 2002, the scholar Molefi Kete Asante named Edmonia Lewis on his list of 100 Greatest African Americans. Her work is known for incorporating themes relating to Black people and indigenous peoples of the Americas into Neoclassical-style sculpture. Biography Edmonia repeatedly gave out misinformation about her early life. She was inconsistent even with basic facts about her origins, presenting herself, if she thought it would help her, as \\"an Indian girl\\", \\"born in a wigwam\\", \\"hunting, fishing, and making mocassins\\" the exotic product of a childhood spent roaming the forests with her mother‚Äôs people. On official documents she gave 1842, 1844, and even 1854 as her birth year. She played, or pretended to be, the \\"noble savage\\", and told \\"white lies\\" about her upbringing. However, she was born in the Albany, New York area, and most of her girlhood was apparently spent in Newark, New Jersey. By the time she got to college she was economically privileged, because her older brother had made a fortune in the California gold rush and \\"supplied her every want anticipating her wishes after the style and manner of a person of ample income\\". Early life Hiawatha, 1868, by Edmonia Lewis, inspired by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's Song of Hiawatha. Like Hiawatha, Lewis was of Ojibwe descent. Based on her own often inconsistent statements, as there is no relevant document, Edmonia Lewis was born about July 4, 1844; Americans who did not know their birthday often said it was July 4. She was born free in the former town of Greenbush, Rensselaer County, New York. Her mother, Catherine Mike Lewis, was mixed-race; of Mississauga Ojibwe and African-American descent. She was an excellent weaver and craftswoman. Two different African- American men are mentioned in different sources as being her father. The first is Samuel Lewis, who was Afro-Haitian and worked as a valet (gentleman's servant). Other sources say her father was the writer on African Americans, Robert Benjamin Lewis. Her half-brother Samuel, who is treated at some length in a history of Montana, said that their father was \\"a West Indian Frenchman\\", and his mother \\"part African and partly a descendant of the educated Narragansett Indians of New York state.\\" (Narragansett Indians are from Rhode Island and not known for education.) By the time Lewis reached the age of nine, both of her parents had died; Samuel Lewis died in 1847 and Robert Benjamin Lewis in 1853. Her two maternal aunts adopted her and her older half- brother Samuel. Samuel was born in 1835 to his father of the same name, and his first wife, in Haiti. The family came to the United States when Samuel was a young child. Samuel became a barber at age 12 after their father died. The children lived with their aunts near Niagara Falls, New York, for about four years. Lewis and her aunts sold Ojibwe baskets and other items, such as moccasins and embroidered blouses, to tourists visiting Niagara Falls, Toronto, and Buffalo. During this time, Lewis went by her Native American name, Wildfire, while her brother was called Sunshine. In 1852, Samuel left for San Francisco, California, leaving Lewis in the care of a Captain S. R. Mills. Samuel provided for her board and education. In 1856, Lewis enrolled in a pre-college program at New-York Central College, McGrawville, a Baptist abolitionist school. At McGrawville, Lewis met many of the leading activists who would become mentors, patrons, and possible subjects for her work as her artistic career developed. In a later interview, Lewis said that she left the school after three years, having been \\"declared to be wild.\\" However, her academic record at Central College (1856‚ÄìFall 1858) has been located, and her grades, \\"conduct\\", and attendance were all exemplary. Her classes included Latin, French, \\"grammar\\", arithmetic, drawing, composition, and declamation (public speaking). Education In 1859, when Edmonia Lewis was about 15 years old, her brother Samuel and abolitionists sent her to Oberlin, Ohio, where she attended the secondary Oberlin Academy Preparatory School for the full, three-year course, Blodgett, Geoffrey. ‚ÄúJohn Mercer Langston and the Case of Edmonia Lewis: Oberlin, 1862.‚Äù The Journal of Negro History, vol. 53, no. 3, 1968, pp. 201‚Äì218. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/2716216. before entering Oberlin Collegiate Institute (since 1866, Oberlin College), one of the first U.S. higher-learning institutions to admit women and people of differing ethnicities. The Ladies' Department was designed \\"to give Young Ladies facilities for the thorough mental discipline, and the special training which will qualify them for teaching and other duties of their sphere.\\" She changed her name to Mary Edmonia Lewis; and began to study art. Lewis boarded with Reverend John Keep and his wife from 1859 until she was forced from the college in 1863. At Oberlin, with a student population of one thousand, Lewis was one of only thirty students of color. Reverend Keep was white, a member of the board of trustees, an avid abolitionist, and a spokesperson for coeducation. Mary said later that she was subject to daily racism and discrimination. She, and other female students, were rarely given the opportunity to participate in the classroom or speak at public meetings. During the winter of 1862, several months after the start of the Civil War, an incident occurred between Lewis and two Oberlin classmates, Maria Miles and Christina Ennes. The three women, all boarding in Keep's home, planned to go sleigh riding with some young men later that day. Before the sleighing, Lewis served her friends a drink of spiced wine. Shortly after, Miles and Ennes fell severely ill. Doctors examined them and concluded that the two women had some sort of poison in their system, supposedly cantharides, a reputed aphrodisiac. For a time it was not certain that they would survive. Days later, it became apparent that the two women would recover from the incident. Authorities initially took no action. News of the controversial incident rapidly spread throughout Ohio. In the town of Oberlin, where the general population was not as progressive as at the college, while Lewis was walking home alone one night she was dragged into an open field by unknown assailants, badly beaten, and left for dead.; After the attack, local authorities arrested Lewis, charging her with poisoning her friends. John Mercer Langston, an Oberlin College alumnus and the first African-American lawyer in Ohio, represented Lewis during her trial. Although most witnesses spoke against her and she did not testify, Chapman moved successfully to have the charges dismissed: the contents of the victims' stomachs had not been analized and there was, therefore, no evidence of poisoning, no corpus delicti. The remainder of Lewis' time at Oberlin was marked by isolation and prejudice. About a year after the poisoning trial, Lewis was accused of stealing artists' materials from the college. She was acquitted due to lack of evidence. Only a few months later she was charged with aiding and abetting a burglary. At this point she had had enough, and left. Another report says that she was forbidden from registering for her last term, leaving her unable to graduate. Art career=Boston Minnehaha, marble, 1868, collection of the Newark Museum After college, Lewis moved to Boston in early 1864, where she began to pursue her career as a sculptor. She repeatedly told a story about encountering in Boston a statue of Benjamin Franklin, not knowing what it was or what to call it, but concluding she could make a \\"stone man\\" herself.\\\\ This cannot possibly be correct: after 2+ years at both Central College and at Oberlin she certainly knew what a sculpture was. The Keeps wrote a letter of introduction on Lewis' behalf to abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison in Boston, as did Henry Highland Garnet.. He introduced her to already established sculptors in the area, as well as writers who publicized Lewis in the abolitionist press. Finding an instructor, however, was not easy for her. Three male sculptors refused to instruct her before she was introduced to the moderately successful sculptor, Edward Augustus Brackett (1818‚Äì1908). Brackett specialized in marble portrait busts. His clients were some of the most important abolitionists of the day, including Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Wm. Lloyd Garrison, Charles Sumner, and John Brown. To instruct her, he lent her fragments of sculptures to copy in clay, which he critiqued. Under his tutelage, she crafted her own sculpting tools and sold her first piece, a sculpture of a woman's hand, for $8. Anne Whitney, a fellow sculptor and friend of Lewis', wrote in an 1864 letter to her sister that Lewis's relationship with her instructor did not end amicably, but did not disclose the reason for the split. Lewis opened her studio to the public in her first solo exhibition in 1864. Lewis was inspired by the lives of abolitionists and Civil War heroes. Her subjects in 1863 and 1864 included some of the most famous abolitionists of her day: John Brown and Colonel Robert Gould Shaw. When she met Union Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, the commander of an African-American Civil War regiment from Massachusetts, she was inspired to create a bust of his likeness, which impressed the Shaw family, who purchased her homage. Lewis then made plaster cast reproductions of the bust; she sold one hundred at 15 dollars apiece. This was the most famous work to date and the money she earned from the busts allowed her to eventually move to Rome. Anna Quincy Waterston, a poet, then wrote a poem about both Lewis and Shaw. From 1864 to 1871, Lewis was written about or interviewed by Lydia Maria Child, Elizabeth Peabody, Anna Quincy Waterston, and Laura Curtis Bullard: all important women in Boston and New York abolitionist circles. Because of these women, articles about Lewis appeared in important abolitionist journals, including Broken Fetter, the Christian Register, and the Independent, as well as many others. Lewis was aware of her reception in Boston. She was not opposed to the coverage she received in the abolitionist press, and she was not known to turn down monetary aid, but she could not tolerate the false praise. She knew that some did not really appreciate her art, but saw her as an opportunity to express and show their support for human rights. Early works that proved highly popular included medallion portraits of the abolitionists John Brown, described as \\"her hero\\", and Wm. Lloyd Garrison. Lewis also drew inspiration from Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and his work, particularly his epic poem The Song of Hiawatha. She made several busts of its leading characters, which he drew from Ojibwe legend. Rome While in Rome, Lewis adopted the neoclassical style of sculpture, as seen in Bust of Dr. Dio Lewis (1868). The success and popularity of these works in Boston allowed Lewis to bear the cost of a trip to Rome in 1866. On her 1865 passport is written, \\"M. Edmonia Lewis is a Black girl sent by subscription to Italy having displayed great talents as a sculptor\\". The established sculptor Hiram Powers gave her space to work in his studio. She entered a circle of expatriate artists and established her own space within the former studio of 18th-century Italian sculptor Antonio Canova. She received professional support from both Charlotte Cushman, a Boston actress and a pivotal figure for expatriate sculptors in Rome, and Maria Weston Chapman, a dedicated worker for the anti-slavery cause. Lewis spent most of her adult career in Rome, where Italy's less pronounced racism allowed increased opportunity to a black artist. There Lewis enjoyed more social, spiritual, and artistic freedom than what she had had in the United States. Being a Catholic, her experience in Rome also allowed her both spiritual and physical closeness to her faith. In America, Lewis would have had to continue relying on abolitionist patronage; but Italy allowed her to make her own in the international art world. She began sculpting in marble, working within the neoclassical manner, but focusing on naturalism within themes and images relating to black and American Indian people. The surroundings of the classical world greatly inspired her and influenced her work, in which she recreated the classical art style - such as presenting people in her sculptures as draped in robes rather than in contemporary clothing. Lewis was unique in the way she approached sculpting abroad. She insisted on enlarging her clay and wax models in marble herself, rather than hire native Italian sculptors to do it for her - the common practice at the time. Male sculptors were largely skeptical of the talent of female sculptors, and often accused them of not doing their own work. Harriet Hosmer, a fellow sculptor and expatriate, also did this. Lewis also was known to make sculptures before receiving commissions for them, or sent unsolicited works to Boston patrons requesting that they raise funds for materials and shipping. While in Rome, Lewis continued to express her African-American and Native American heritage. One of her more famous works, \\"Forever Free\\", depicted a powerful image of an African American man and women emerging from the bonds of slavery. Another sculpture Lewis created was called \\"The Arrow Maker\\", which showed a Native American father teaching his daughter how to make an arrow. Her work sold for large sums of money. In 1873 an article in the New Orleans Picayune stated: \\"Edmonia Lewis had snared two 50,000-dollar commissions.\\" Her new-found popularity made her studio a tourist destination. Lewis had many major exhibitions during her rise to fame, including one in Chicago, Illinois, in 1870, and in Rome in 1871. Later career A major coup in her career was participating in the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. For this, she created a monumental 3,015-pound marble sculpture, The Death of Cleopatra; portraying the queen in the throes of death. This piece depicts the moment popularized by Shakespeare in Antony and Cleopatra, in which Cleopatra had allowed herself to be bitten by a poisonous asp following the loss of her crown. Of the piece, J. S. Ingraham wrote that Cleopatra was \\"the most remarkable piece of sculpture in the American section\\" of the Exposition. Much of the viewing public was shocked by Lewis's frank portrayal of death, but the statue drew thousands of viewers nonetheless. Cleopatra was considered a woman of both sensuous beauty and demonic power, and her self-annihilation has been portrayed numerously in art, literature and cinema. In Death of Cleopatra, Edmonia Lewis added an innovative flair by portraying the Egyptian queen in a disheveled, inelegant manner, a departure from the refined, composed Victorian approach of representing death. Considering Lewis's interest in emancipation imagery as seen in her work Forever Free, it is not surprising that Lewis eliminated Cleopatra's usual companion figures of loyal slaves from her work. Lewis's The Death of Cleopatra may have been a response to the culture of the Centennial Exposition, which celebrated one-hundred years of the United States being built around the principles of liberty and freedom, a celebration of unity despite centuries of slavery, the recent Civil War, and the failing attempts and efforts of Reconstruction. In order to avoid any acknowledgement of black empowerment by the Centennial, Lewis's sculpture could not have directly addressed the subject of Emancipation. Although her white contemporaries were also sculpting Cleopatra and other comparable subject matter (such as Harriet Hosmer's Zenobia), Lewis was more prone to scrutiny on the premise of race and gender due to the fact that she, like Cleopatra, was female: > The associations between Cleopatra and a black Africa were so profound that > ... any depiction of the ancient Egyptian queen had to contend with the > issue of her race and the potential expectation of her blackness. Lewis' > white queen gained the aura of historical accuracy through primary research > without sacrificing its symbolic links to abolitionism, black Africa, or > black diaspora. But what it refused to facilitate was the racial > objectification of the artist's body. Lewis could not so readily become the > subject of her own representation if her subject was corporeally white. After being placed in storage, the statue was moved to the 1878 Chicago Interstate Exposition where it remained unsold. Then the sculpture was acquired by a gambler by the name of \\"Blind John\\" Condon who purchased it from a saloon on Clark street to mark the grave of a Racehorse named \\"Cleopatra\\". The grave was in front of the grandstand of his Harlem race track in the Chicago suburb of Forest Park, where the sculpture remained for nearly a century until the land was bought by the U.S. Postal Service and the sculpture was moved to a construction storage yard in Cicero. While at the storage yard, The Death of Cleopatra sustained extensive damage at the hands of well-meaning Boy Scouts who painted and caused other damage to the sculpture. Dr. James Orland, a dentist in Forest Park, and member of the Forest Park Historical Society acquired the sculpture and held it in private storage at the Forest Park Mall. Later, Marilyn Richardson, an assistant professor in the erstwhile The Writing Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and later curator and scholar of African-American art, went searching for The Death of Cleopatra for her biography of Lewis. Richardson was directed to the Forest Park Historical Society and Dr. Orland by the Metropolitan Museum of Art who had earlier been contacted by the historical society regarding the sculpture. Richardson, after confirming the sculpture's location, contacted African-American bibliographer Dorothy Porter Wesley and the two gained the attention of NMAA's George Gurney. According to Gurney, Curator Emeritus at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the sculpture was in a race track in Forest Park, Illinois, during World War II. Finally, the sculpture came under the purview of the Forest Park Historical Society, who donated it to Smithsonian American Art Museum in 1994. Chicago-based Andrezej Dajnowski, in conjunction with the Smithsonian, spent $30,000 to restore it to its near- original state. The repairs were extensive, including the nose, sandals, hands, chin, and extensive \\"sugaring\\" (disintegration.) A testament to Lewis's renown as an artist came in 1877, when former US President Ulysses S. Grant commissioned her to do his portrait. He sat for her as a model and was pleased with her finished piece. She also contributed a bust of Charles Sumner to the 1895 Atlanta Exposition. In the late 1880s, neoclassicism declined in popularity, as did the popularity of Lewis's artwork. She continued sculpting in marble, increasingly creating altarpieces and other works for Roman Catholic patrons. In the art world, she became eclipsed by history and lost fame. By 1901 she had moved to London. The events of her later years are not known. Reception As a black artist, Edmonia Lewis had to be conscious of her stylistic choices, as her largely white audience often gravely misread her work as self-portraiture. In order to avoid this, her female figures typically possess European features. Lewis had to balance her own personal identity with her artistic, social, and national identity, a tiring activity that affected her art. In her 2007 work, Charmaine Nelson wrote of Lewis: > It is hard to overstate the visual incongruity of the black-Native female > body, let alone that identity in a sculptor, within the Roman colony. As the > first black-Native sculptor of either sex to achieve international > recognition within a western sculptural tradition, Lewis was a symbolic and > social anomaly within a dominantly white bourgeois and aristocratic > community. Family Lewis never married and had no known children. According to her biographer, Dr. Marilyn Richardson, there is no definite information about her romantic involvement with anyone, male or female. However, in 1873 her engagement was announced, and in 1875, still engaged, his skin color was revealed to be the same as hers, although his name is not given. There is no further reference to this engagement, which could well be another of Lewis' \\"white lies\\". Samuel Lewis Her half-brother Samuel became a barber in San Francisco, eventually moving to mining camps in Idaho and Montana. In 1868, he settled in the city of Bozeman, Montana, where he set up a barber shop on Main Street. He prospered, eventually investing in commercial real estate, and subsequently built his own home which still stands at 308 South Bozeman Avenue. In 1999 the Samuel Lewis House was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1884, he married Mrs. Melissa Railey Bruce, a widow with six children. The couple had one son, Samuel E. Lewis (1886‚Äì1914), who married but died childless. The elder Lewis died after \\"a short illness\\" in 1896 and is buried in Sunset Hills Cemetery in Bozeman. The mayor of Bozeman was a pallbearer. Death Lewis's grave in St. Mary's Roman Catholic Cemetery, London Lewis lived in the Hammersmith area of London, England, before her death on September 17, 1907, in the Hammersmith Borough Infirmary. According to her death certificate, the cause of her death was chronic Bright's disease. She is buried in St. Mary's Roman Catholic Cemetery, in London. There were earlier theories that Lewis died in Rome in 1907 or, alternatively, that she had died in Marin County, California, and was buried in an unmarked grave in San Francisco. Edmonia Lewis' grave after restoration In 2017, a GoFundMe by East Greenbush, New York, Town Historian Bobbie Reno was successful, and Edmonia Lewis's grave was restored. The work was done by the E M Lander Co. in London. Works=Descriptions of most popular worksForever Free (1867)= Forever Free, by Edmonia Lewis, 1867 The words \\"forever free\\" are taken from Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, of 1863. This white marble sculpture represents a man standing, staring up, and raising his left arm into the air. Wrapped around his left wrist is a chain; however, this chain is not restraining him. To his right is a woman kneeling with her hands held in a prayer position. The man's right hand is gently placed on her right shoulder. Forever Free is a celebration of black liberation, salvation, and redemption; and represents the emancipation of African-American slaves. Lewis attempted to break stereotypes of African- American women with this sculpture. For example, she portrayed the woman as completely dressed while the man was partially dressed. This drew attention away from the notion of African-American women being sexual figures. This sculpture also symbolizes the end of the Civil War. While African Americans were legally free, they continued to be restrained, shown by the fact that the couple had chains wrapped around their bodies. The representation of race and gender has been critiqued by modern scholars, particularly the Eurocentric features of the female figure. This piece is held by Howard University Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. =Hagar (1868)= Lewis had a tendency to sculpt historically strong women, as demonstrated not just in Hagar but also in Lewis's Cleopatra piece. Lewis also depicted regular women in great situations, emphasizing their strength. Hagar is inspired by a character from the Old Testament, the handmaid or slave of Abraham's wife Sarah. Being unable to conceive a child, Sarah gave Hagar to Abraham, in order to bear him a son. Hagar gave birth to Abraham's firstborn son Ishmael, and after Sarah gave birth to her own son Isaac, she resented Hagar and made Abraham \\"cast her into the wilderness\\". The piece was made of white marble, and Hagar is kneeling, with her hands clasped in prayer and staring slightly up but not straight across. Lewis uses Hagar to symbolize the African mother in the United States, and the frequent abuse of African women. =Old Arrow-Maker and his Daughter (1866)= This sculpture was inspired by Lewis's Native American heritage. An arrow-maker and his daughter sit on a round base, dressed in traditional Native American clothes. The male figure has recognizable Native American facial features, but not the daughter - Lewis chose to \\"whitewash\\" the facial structures of women. As white audiences' misread her work as self-portraiture, she often removed all facial features associated with \\"colored\\" races in female portrayal.

Development was carried out by Saab and the car was manufactured in Trollh√§ttan, Sweden, alongside the Saab 9-3 and the Saab 9-5. Sales of the sedan began in March 2006, with a station wagon joining the line for 2007. Starting in 2007, the BLS was sold in the Middle East, Mexico, South Africa and South Korea. It was never sold in the United States nor Canada. BLS production reached 3,257 in 2006 and 2,772 in 2007.Automobil Revue, catalog 2008, p. 47auto motor und sport, #3/2008, p.13 Production ended in 2009. Features The BLS was available with a diesel engine (a 1.9 L turbocharged four-cylinder) and two petrol engines (a 2.8 L turbocharged V6 and a 2.0 L available with two power levels). At in overall length, the BLS was almost six inches shorter than the CTS, the smallest Cadillac available in North America.

Well proven mechanicals. Saab-grade safety. Negatives: The ride is far from forgiving. Automatic doesn't work well with the V6 turbo, which also has overly light steering. *Verdict On Cars 'Average. It's built in Europe, shares most of its underpinnings with a Saab and will never see America - meet the strangest Cadillac ever.' Name The BLS is known by many as the \\"Bob Lutz Special\\" - a reference to Vice Chairman Bob Lutz who oversaw all GM product development at the time. Lutz, a supporter of badge engineering, wanted to leverage the SAAB 9-3 to fill holes in Cadillac's product range. The reference to Bob Lutz can be viewed both as support and as criticism of his strategy. While the BLS was a market failure, many of the techniques of badge engineering employed in the BLS resulted in other GM product successes, most notably a significant improvement in overall passenger car product quality and performance output. Under Lutz's revamped strategy, most Cadillac model names had no meaning (aside from preceding models, such as DTS for Deville Touring Sedan, or CTS for Catera Touring Sedan). Hence, the BLS has no official name for its abbreviation - fueling the community namesake. While GM has never formally said why the BLS bore its name, it is likely the B was chosen for being smaller than the CTS mid-size sedan, L for Luxury, and S for Sedan. This is consistent with the Seville Luxury Sedan, or later the Cadillac SLS.

It is a weighted wheel that rotates back and forth, being returned toward its center position by a spiral torsion spring, known as the balance spring or hairspring. It is driven by the escapement, which transforms the rotating motion of the watch gear train into impulses delivered to the balance wheel. Each swing of the wheel (called a 'tick' or 'beat') allows the gear train to advance a set amount, moving the hands forward. The balance wheel and hairspring together form a harmonic oscillator, which due to resonance oscillates preferentially at a certain rate, its resonant frequency or 'beat', and resists oscillating at other rates. The combination of the mass of the balance wheel and the elasticity of the spring keep the time between each oscillation or ‚Äòtick‚Äô very constant, accounting for its nearly universal use as the timekeeper in mechanical watches to the present. From its invention in the 14th century until tuning fork and quartz movements became available in the 1960s, virtually every portable timekeeping device used some form of balance wheel. Overview Until the 1980s balance wheels were the timekeeping technology used in chronometers, bank vault time locks, time fuzes for munitions, alarm clocks, kitchen timers and stopwatches, but quartz technology has taken over these applications, and the main remaining use is in quality mechanical watches. Modern (2007) watch balance wheels are usually made of Glucydur, a low thermal expansion alloy of beryllium, copper and iron, with springs of a low thermal coefficient of elasticity alloy such as Nivarox. The two alloys are matched so their residual temperature responses cancel out, resulting in even lower temperature error. The wheels are smooth, to reduce air friction, and the pivots are supported on precision jewel bearings. Older balance wheels used weight screws around the rim to adjust the poise (balance), but modern wheels are computer-poised at the factory, using a laser to burn a precise pit in the rim to make them balanced. Balance wheels rotate about 1¬Ω turns with each swing, that is, about 270¬∞ to each side of their center equilibrium position. The rate of the balance wheel is adjusted with the regulator, a lever with a narrow slit on the end through which the balance spring passes. This holds the part of the spring behind the slit stationary. Moving the lever slides the slit up and down the balance spring, changing its effective length, and thus the resonant vibration rate of the balance. Since the regulator interferes with the spring's action, chronometers and some precision watches have ‚Äòfree sprung‚Äô balances with no regulator, such as the Gyromax. Their rate is adjusted by weight screws on the balance rim. A balance's vibration rate is traditionally measured in beats (ticks) per hour, or BPH, although beats per second and Hz are also used. The length of a beat is one swing of the balance wheel, between reversals of direction, so there are two beats in a complete cycle. Balances in precision watches are designed with faster beats, because they are less affected by motions of the wrist. Alarm clocks and kitchen timers often have a rate of 4 beats per second (14,400 BPH). Watches made prior to the 1970s usually had a rate of 5 beats per second (18,000 BPH). Current watches have rates of 6 (21,600 BPH), 8 (28,800 BPH) and a few have 10 beats per second (36,000 BPH). Audemars Piguet currently produces a watch with a very high balance vibration rate of 12 beats/s (43,200 BPH). During WWII, Elgin produced a very precise stopwatch that ran at 40 beats per second (144,000 BPH), earning it the nickname 'Jitterbug'. The precision of the best balance wheel watches on the wrist is around a few seconds per day. The most accurate balance wheel timepieces made were marine chronometers, which were used on ships for celestial navigation, as a precise time source to determine longitude. By WWII they had achieved accuracies of 0.1 second per day. Period of oscillation A balance wheel's period of oscillation T in seconds, the time required for one complete cycle (two beats), is determined by the wheel's moment of inertia I in kilogram- meter2 and the stiffness (spring constant) of its balance spring Œ∫ in newton- meters per radian: :T = 2 \\\\pi \\\\sqrt{ \\\\frac {I}{\\\\kappa} } \\\\, Foliot (horizontal bar with weights) from De Vick clock, built 1379, Paris History Perhaps the earliest existing drawing of a balance wheel, in Giovanni de Dondi's astronomical clock, built 1364, Padua, Italy. The balance wheel (crown shape, top) had a beat of 2 seconds. Tracing of an illustration from his 1364 clock treatise, Il Tractatus Astrarii. The balance wheel appeared with the first mechanical clocks, in 14th century Europe, but it seems unknown exactly when or where it was first used. It is an improved version of the foliot, an early inertial timekeeper consisting of a straight bar pivoted in the center with weights on the ends, which oscillates back and forth. The foliot weights could be slid in or out on the bar, to adjust the rate of the clock. The first clocks in northern Europe used foliots, while those in southern Europe used balance wheels., p. 124 As clocks were made smaller, first as bracket clocks and lantern clocks and then as the first large watches after 1500, balance wheels began to be used in place of foliots., p. 92 Since more of its weight is located on the rim away from the axis, a balance wheel could have a larger moment of inertia than a foliot of the same size, and keep better time. The wheel shape also had less air resistance, and its geometry partly compensated for thermal expansion error due to temperature changes. Addition of balance spring Early balance wheel with spring in an 18th-century French watch These early balance wheels were crude timekeepers because they lacked the other essential element: the balance spring. Early balance wheels were pushed in one direction by the escapement until the verge flag that was in contact with a tooth on the escape wheel slipped past the tip of the tooth (\\"escaped\\") and the action of the escapement reversed, pushing the wheel back the other way. In such an \\"inertial' wheel, the acceleration is proportional to the drive force. In a clock or watch without balance spring, the drive force provides both the force that accelerates the wheel and also the force that slows it down and reverses it. If the drive force is increased, both acceleration and deceleration are increased, this results in the wheel getting pushed back and forth faster. This made the timekeeping strongly dependent on the force applied by the escapement. In a watch the drive force provided by the mainspring, applied to the escapement through the timepiece's gear train, declined during the watch's running period as the mainspring unwound. Without some means of equalizing the drive force, the watch slowed down during the running period between windings as the spring lost force, causing it to lose time. This is why all pre-balance spring watches required fusees (or in a few cases stackfreeds) to equalize the force from the mainspring reaching the escapement, to achieve even minimal accuracy.\\"Brittens Old Clocks & Watches\\" Edited by Cecil Clutton, G H Baillie & C A Ilbert, Ninth Edition Revised and Enlarged by Cecil Clutton. Bloomsbury Books London 1986 page 16 Even with these devices, watches prior to the balance spring were very inaccurate. The idea of the balance spring was inspired by observations that springy hog bristle curbs, added to limit the rotation of the wheel, increased its accuracy. p. 9 pp. 108‚Äì109 Robert Hooke first applied a metal spring to the balance in 1658 and Jean de Hautefeuille and Christiaan Huygens improved it to its present spiral form in 1674Milham 1945, p. 224 The addition of the spring made the balance wheel a harmonic oscillator, the basis of every modern clock. This means the wheel vibrated at a natural resonant frequency or ‚Äòbeat‚Äô and resisted changes in its vibration rate caused by friction or changing drive force. This crucial innovation greatly increased the accuracy of watches, from several hours per dayMilham 1945, p. 226 to perhaps 10 minutes per day, changing them from expensive novelties into useful timekeepers. Temperature error After the balance spring was added, a major remaining source of inaccuracy was the effect of temperature changes. Early watches had balance springs made of plain steel and balances of brass or steel, and the influence of temperature on these noticeably affected the rate. An increase in temperature increases the dimensions of the balance spring and the balance due to thermal expansion. The strength of a spring, the restoring force it produces in response to a deflection, is proportional to its breadth and the cube of its thickness, and inversely proportional to its length. An increase in temperature would actually make a spring stronger if it affected only its physical dimensions. However, a much larger effect in a balance spring made of plain steel is that the elasticity of the spring's metal decreases significantly as the temperature increases, the net effect being that a plain steel spring becomes weaker with increasing temperature. An increase in temperature also increases diameter of a steel or brass balance wheel, increasing its rotational inertia, its moment of inertia, making it harder for the balance spring to accelerate. The two effects of increasing temperature on physical dimensions of the spring and the balance, the strengthening of the balance spring and the increase in rotational inertia of the balance, have opposing effects and to an extent cancel each other.A.L. Rawlings, Timothy Treffry, The Science of Clocks and Watches, Publisher: BHI, , Edition: 1993, 3rd enlarged and revised edition. The major effect of temperature which affects the rate of a watch is the weakening of the balance spring with increasing temperature. In a watch that is not compensated for the effects of temperature the weaker spring takes longer to return the balance wheel back toward the center, so the ‚Äòbeat‚Äô gets slower and the watch loses time. Ferdinand Berthoud found in 1773 that an ordinary brass balance and steel hairspring, subjected to a 60 ¬∞F (33 ¬∞C) temperature increase, loses 393 seconds (6 1/2 minutes) per day, of which 312 seconds is due to spring elasticity decrease.Britten 1898, p. 37 Temperature-compensated balance wheels The need for an accurate clock for celestial navigation during sea voyages drove many advances in balance technology in 18th century Britain and France. Even a 1-second per day error in a marine chronometer could result in a 17-mile error in ship's position after a 2-month voyage. John Harrison was first to apply temperature compensation to a balance wheel in 1753, using a bimetallic ‚Äòcompensation curb‚Äô on the spring, in the first successful marine chronometers, H4 and H5. These achieved an accuracy of a fraction of a second per day, but the compensation curb was not further used because of its complexity. Bimetallic temperature-compensated balance wheel, from an early 1900s pocket watch. 17 mm dia. (1) Moving opposing pairs of weights closer to the ends of the arms increases temperature compensation. (2) Unscrewing pairs of weights near the spokes slows the oscillation rate. Adjusting a single weight changes the poise, or balance. A simpler solution was devised around 1765 by Pierre Le Roy, and improved by John Arnold, and Thomas Earnshaw: the Earnshaw or compensating balance wheel.Milham 1945, p. 233 The key was to make the balance wheel change size with temperature. If the balance could be made to shrink in diameter as it got warmer, the smaller moment of inertia would compensate for the weakening of the balance spring, keeping the period of oscillation the same. To accomplish this, the outer rim of the balance was made of a ‚Äòsandwich‚Äô of two metals; a layer of steel on the inside fused to a layer of brass on the outside. Strips of this bimetallic construction bend toward the steel side when they are warmed, because the thermal expansion of brass is greater than steel. The rim was cut open at two points next to the spokes of the wheel, so it resembled an S-shape (see figure) with two circular bimetallic ‚Äòarms‚Äô. These wheels are sometimes referred to as \\"Z-balances\\". A temperature increase makes the arms bend inward toward the center of the wheel, and the shift of mass inward reduces the moment of inertia of the balance, similar to the way a spinning ice skater can reduce her moment of inertia by pulling in her arms. This reduction in the moment of inertia compensated for the reduced torque produced by the weaker balance spring. The amount of compensation is adjusted by moveable weights on the arms. Marine chronometers with this type of balance had errors of only 3‚Äì4 seconds per day over a wide temperature range. p. 227 By the 1870s compensated balances began to be used in watches. Middle temperature error Marine chronometer balance wheels from the mid-1800s, with various 'auxiliary compensation' systems to reduce middle temperature error The standard Earnshaw compensation balance dramatically reduced error due to temperature variations, but it didn't eliminate it. As first described by J. G. Ulrich, a compensated balance adjusted to keep correct time at a given low and high temperature will be a few seconds per day fast at intermediate temperatures. pp. 176‚Äì177 The reason is that the moment of inertia of the balance varies as the square of the radius of the compensation arms, and thus of the temperature. But the elasticity of the spring varies linearly with temperature. To mitigate this problem, chronometer makers adopted various 'auxiliary compensation' schemes, which reduced error below 1 second per day. Such schemes consisted for example of small bimetallic arms attached to the inside of the balance wheel. Such compensators could only bend in one direction toward the center of the balance wheel, but bending outward would be blocked by the wheel itself. The blocked movement causes a non-linear temperature response that could slightly better compensate the elasticity changes in the spring. Most of the chronometers that came in first in the annual Greenwich Observatory trials between 1850 and 1914 were auxiliary compensation designs.Gould 1923, pp. 265‚Äì266 Auxiliary compensation was never used in watches because of its complexity. Better materials ETA 1280 movement from a Benrus Co. watch made in the 1950s The bimetallic compensated balance wheel was made obsolete in the early 20th century by advances in metallurgy. Charles √âdouard Guillaume won a Nobel prize for the 1896 invention of Invar, a nickel steel alloy with very low thermal expansion, and Elinvar (Elasticit√© invariable) an alloy whose elasticity is unchanged over a wide temperature range, for balance springs.Milham 1945, p. 234 A solid Invar balance with a spring of Elinvar was largely unaffected by temperature, so it replaced the difficult-to-adjust bimetallic balance. This led to a series of improved low temperature coefficient alloys for balances and springs. Before developing Elinvar, Guillaume also invented an alloy to compensate for middle temperature error in bimetallic balances by endowing it with a negative quadratic temperature coefficient. This alloy, named anibal, is a slight variation of invar. It almost completely negated the temperature effect of the steel hairspring, but still required a bimetal compensated balance wheel, known as a Guillaume balance wheel. This design later fell out of use in favor of single metal Invar balances with Elinvar springs. The quadratic coefficient is defined by its place in the equation of expansion of a material;Gould, p. 201. : \\\\ell_\\\\theta = \\\\ell_0 (1 + \\\\alpha \\\\theta + \\\\beta \\\\theta^2) \\\\, :where: :\\\\scriptstyle \\\\ell_0 is the length of the sample at some reference temperature :\\\\scriptstyle \\\\theta is the temperature above the reference :\\\\scriptstyle \\\\ell_\\\\theta is the length of the sample at temperature \\\\scriptstyle \\\\theta :\\\\scriptstyle \\\\alpha is the linear coefficient of expansion :\\\\scriptstyle \\\\beta is the quadratic coefficient of expansion References * * .

Footnotes Category:Timekeeping components ","title":"Balance wheel"},{"id":"1504896","text":"A number of cyberpunk derivatives have become recognized as distinct subgenres in speculative fiction. Although these derivatives do not share cyberpunk's digitally-focused setting, they may display other qualities drawn from or analogous to cyberpunk: a world built on one particular technology that is extrapolated to a highly sophisticated level (this may even be a fantastical or anachronistic technology, akin to retro-futurism), a gritty transreal urban style, or a particular approach to social themes. One of the most well-known of these subgenres, steampunk, has been defined as a \\"kind of technological fantasy\\", and others in this category sometimes also incorporate aspects of science fantasy and historical fantasy. Scholars have written of these subgenres' stylistic place in postmodern literature, and also their ambiguous interaction with the historical perspective of postcolonialism. American author Bruce Bethke coined the term \\"cyberpunk\\" in his 1980 short story of the same name, proposing it as a label for a new generation of punk teenagers inspired by the perceptions inherent to the Information Age. The term was quickly appropriated as a label to be applied to the works of William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, John Shirley, Rudy Rucker, Michael Swanwick, Pat Cadigan, Lewis Shiner, Richard Kadrey, and others. Science fiction author Lawrence Person, in defining postcyberpunk, summarized the characteristics of cyberpunk thus: > Classic cyberpunk characters were marginalized, alienated loners who lived > on the edge of society in generally dystopic futures where daily life was > impacted by rapid technological change, an ubiquitous datasphere of > computerized information, and invasive modification of the human body. The relevance of cyberpunk as a genre to punk subculture is debatable and further hampered by the lack of a defined cyberpunk subculture; where the small cyber movement shares themes with cyberpunk fiction and draws inspiration from punk and goth alike, cyberculture is much more popular though much less defined, encompassing virtual communities and cyberspace in general and typically embracing optimistic anticipations about the future. Cyberpunk is nonetheless regarded as a successful genre, as it ensnared many new readers and provided the sort of movement that postmodern literary critics found alluring. Furthermore, author David Brin argues, cyberpunk made science fiction more attractive and profitable for mainstream media and the visual arts in general.  Futuristic derivatives = Biopunk  Biopunk emerged during the 1990s and focuses on the near-future unintended consequences of the biotechnology revolution following the discovery of recombinant DNA. Biopunk fiction typically describes the struggles of individuals or groups, often the product of human experimentation, against a backdrop of totalitarian governments or megacorporations which misuse biotechnologies as means of social control or profiteering. Unlike cyberpunk, it builds not on information technology but on biorobotics and synthetic biology. As in postcyberpunk however, individuals are usually modified and enhanced not with cyberware, but by genetic manipulation of their chromosomes.  Nanopunk  Nanopunk refers to an emerging subgenre of speculative science fiction still very much in its infancy in comparison to other genres like that of cyberpunk. The genre is similar to biopunk, but describes a world in which the use of biotechnology is limited or prohibited, and only nanites and nanotechnology is in wide use (while in biopunk bio- and nanotechnologies often coexist). Currently the genre is more concerned with the artistic and physiological impact of nanotechnology, than of aspects of the technology itself. Still, one of the most prominent examples of nanopunk is the Crysis video game series; less famous examples are Generator Rex and Transcendence.  Postcyberpunk  As new writers and artists began to experiment with cyberpunk ideas, new varieties of fiction emerged, sometimes addressing the criticisms leveled at the original cyberpunk stories. Lawrence Person wrote in an essay he posted to the Internet forum Slashdot in 1998: Person advocates using the term \\"postcyberpunk\\" for the strain of science fiction he describes. In this view, typical postcyberpunk stories explore themes related to a \\"world of accelerating technological innovation and ever-increasing complexity in ways relevant to our everyday lives\\" with a continued focus on social aspects within a post-third industrial-era society, such as of ubiquitous dataspheres and cybernetic augmentation of the human body. Unlike cyberpunk its works may portray a utopia or to blend elements of both extremes into a more mature (to cyberpunk) societal vision. Rafael Miranda Huereca states: The Daemon novels by Daniel Suarez could be considered postcyberpunk in that sense. In addition to themes of its ancestral genre postcyberpunk might also combine elements of nanopunk and biopunk. Often named examples of postcyberpunk novels are Neal Stephenson's The Diamond Age and Bruce Sterling's Holy Fire. In television, Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex has been called \\"the most interesting, sustained postcyberpunk media work in existence\\". In 2007, SF writers James Patrick Kelly and John Kessel published Rewired: The Post-Cyberpunk Anthology. Like all categories discerned within science fiction, the boundaries of postcyberpunk are likely to be fluid or ill-defined. Cyber noir= Retrofuturistic derivatives  As a wider variety of writers began to work with cyberpunk concepts, new subgenres of science fiction emerged, playing off the cyberpunk label, and focusing on technology and its social effects in different ways. Many derivatives of cyberpunk are retro-futuristic, based either on the futuristic visions of past eras, especially from the first and second industrial revolution technological-eras, or more recent extrapolations or exaggerations of the actual technology of those eras.  Steampunk  Victorian-style attire with a steampunk mechanical arm The word \\"steampunk\\" was invented in 1987 as a jocular reference to some of the novels of Tim Powers, James P. Blaylock, and K. W. Jeter. When Gibson and Sterling entered the subgenre with their 1990 collaborative novel The Difference Engine the term was being used earnestly as well. Alan Moore's and Kevin O'Neill's 1999 The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen historical fantasy comic book series (and the subsequent 2003 film adaptation) popularized the steampunk genre and helped propel it into mainstream fiction. The most immediate form of steampunk subculture is the community of fans surrounding the genre. Others move beyond this, attempting to adopt a \\"steampunk\\" aesthetic through fashion, home decor and even music. This movement may also be (perhaps more accurately) described as \\"Neo-Victorianism\\", which is the amalgamation of Victorian aesthetic principles with modern sensibilities and technologies. This characteristic is particularly evident in steampunk fashion which tends to synthesize punk, goth and rivet styles as filtered through the Victorian era. As an object style, however, steampunk adopts more distinct characteristics with various craftspersons modding modern-day devices into a pseudo-Victorian mechanical \\"steampunk\\" style. The goal of such redesigns is to employ appropriate materials (such as polished brass, iron, and wood) with design elements and craftsmanship consistent with the Victorian era.  Dieselpunk  Dieselpunk Dieselpunk is a genre and art style based on the aesthetics popular between World War I and the end of World War II. The style combines the artistic and genre influences of the period (including pulp magazines, serial films, film noir, art deco, and wartime pin-ups) with retro-futuristic technology and postmodern sensibilities. First coined in 2001 as a marketing term by game designer Lewis Pollak to describe his role-playing game Children of the Sun, dieselpunk has grown to describe a distinct style of visual art, music, motion pictures, fiction, and engineering. Examples include the movies Iron Sky, Captain America: The First Avenger, The Rocketeer, K-20: Legend of the Mask, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow and Dark City, and video games such as Crimson Skies, Greed Corp, Gatling Gears, BioShock and its sequel BioShock 2, The Legend of Korra, Skullgirls, Wolfenstein, Iron Harvest, and Final Fantasy VII.  Clockpunk  Clockpunk often portrays Renaissance-era science and technology based on pre-modern designs, in the vein of Mainspring by Jay Lake, and Whitechapel Gods by S. M. Peters. Examples of clockpunk include The Blazing World by Margaret Cavendish,Centuries Before 'Arrival': The Original Science Fiction - The Atlantic Astro-Knights Island in the nonlinear game Poptropica, the Clockwork Mansion level of Dishonored 2, the 2011 film version of The Three Musketeers, the TV series Da Vinci's Demons, as well as the videogames Thief: The Dark Project, Syberia and Assassins Creed 2. The book The Mechanical by Ian Tregillis is self-proclaimed clockpunk literature. For some, clockpunk is steampunk without steam. Atompunk, stonepunk, teslapunk, decopunk, nowpunk, are derivatives of clockpunk. The term was coined by the GURPS role playing system.  Atompunk  Cover of Atomic War number one, November 1952 Atompunk relates to the pre-Third Industrial Revolution short twentieth century, specifically the period of 1945‚Äì1975, including mid-century modernism, the Atomic Age, Jet Age and Space Age, anti-communist and Red Scare paranoia in the United States, along with Neo-Soviet styling, underground cinema, Googie architecture, Sputnik and the Space Race, early Cold War espionage, superhero fiction and comic books and the rise of the U.S. military‚Äìindustrial complex. Its aesthetic tends toward Populuxe and Raygun Gothic, which describe a retro-futuristic vision of the world. While most science fiction of the period carried an atompunk aesthetic, notable examples of atompunk in popular media include the Sean Connery-era of the James Bond franchise, live-action television shows like The Twilight Zone, The Outer Limits, The Avengers, Doctor Who, The Green Hornet and The Man from U.N.C.L.E., animated television shows like Johnny Quest, Speed Racer, Dexter's Laboratory, The Powerpuff Girls, Venture Bros and Archer, comic-books like Justice League of America, Fantastic Four, The Incredible Hulk and Spider-Man, films like The Incredibles, The Iron Giant, Dr. Strangelove, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and X-Men: First Class, and video games like Destroy All Humans! and the Fallout series which received widespread distribution and critical acclaim.  Steelpunk  Steelpunk focuses on the technologies that had their heyday in the late 20th century. In a post describing Steelpunk on the SFFWorld website it is characterised as being \\"about hardware, not software, the real world not the virtual world, megatechnology not nanotechnology. The artefacts of Steelpunk aren't grown, printed or programmed, they're built. With rivets.\\" Examples given in the post include Mad Max, Terminator, Robocop, Barb Wire, Iron Man and Snowpiercer. Other writers suggest Harry Harrison's Stainless Steel Rat series, the Heinlein juveniles and the film Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow.  Islandpunk  Islandpunk is a subgenre of the retrofuturistic subdivisions of cyberpunk that includes narratives set on islands. Such narratives utilise island-based technologies and the island locations to make their thematic statements. Specifically, their protagonists often construct anachronistic technologies from materials such as sticks, leaves, and coconuts. Precursors include William Golding's Lord of the Flies, Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, and the final scenes of Stanley Kubrick's unfinished biopic Napoleon, in which the titular Napoleon is exiled on the island of St. Helena. Notable contemporary examples include Castaway, Gilligan's Island, certain seasons of Survivor, and Moana. Although, since much of the film is set on a boat, some critics argue that Moana should instead be considered boatpunk.  Rococopunk  Rococopunk is a whimsical punk derivative that thrusts punk attitude into the Rococo period, also known as late baroque. Although it is a fairly recent derivative, it is a style that is visually similar to the New Romantic movement of the 1980s (particularly such groups as Adam and the Ants). As one steampunk scholar put it, \\"Imagine a world where the Rococo period never ended, and it had a lovechild with Sid Vicious. Rococopunk has most recently been featured on The X Factor through the artist known as Prince Poppycock. Fashion designer Vivienne Westwood, often known as \\"the Queen of Punk Fashion\\", also mixes Rococo with punk stylings.  Decopunk  Decopunk is a recent subset of Dieselpunk, centered around the art deco and Streamline Moderne art styles, and based around the period between the 1920s and 1950s New York, Chicago, or Boston. In an interview at CoyoteCon, steampunk author Sara M. Harvey made the distinctions \\"shinier than dieselpunk, more like decopunk\\", and \\"Dieselpunk is a gritty version of steampunk set in the 1920s‚Äì1950s. The big war eras, specifically. Decopunk is the sleek, shiny very art deco version; same time period, but everything is chrome!\\" Possibly the most notable examples of this are the first two BioShock games and Skullgirls, films like Dick Tracy, The Rocketeer, The Shadow, and Dark City, comic books like The Goon, and the cartoon Batman: The Animated Series which included neo- noir elements along with modern elements such as the use of VHS cassettes.  Stonepunk  A Flintstones-themed cafeteria, an example of stonepunk architecture Stonepunk refers to works set roughly during the Stone Age in which the characters utilize Neolithic Revolution‚Äìera technology constructed from materials more or less consistent with the time period, but possessing anachronistic complexity and function. The Flintstones franchise and its various spin offs, Roland Emmerich's 10,000 BC, the flashback scenes in Cro, and Dr. Stone fall under this category. Screen examples include the episode The Nightmare of Milky Joe in The Mighty Boosh, Gilligan's Island, and Castaway. The latter three examples could also be considered examples of Islandpunk. Literary examples include Edgar Rice Burroughs' Back to the Stone Age and The Land that Time Forgot, and Jean M. Auel's \\"Earth's Children\\" series, starting with The Clan of the Cave Bear.  Other proposed science fiction derivatives  There have been a handful of divergent terms based on the general concepts of steampunk. These are typically considered unofficial and are often invented by readers, or by authors referring to their own works, often humorously. A large number of terms have been used by the GURPS roleplaying game Steampunk to describe anachronistic technologies and settings, including stonepunk (Stone Age tech), bronzepunk (Bronze Age tech), ironpunk (Iron Age tech), candlepunk (Medieval and Renaissance tech), and transistorpunk (Atomic Age tech). These terms have seen very little use outside GURPS.Stoddard, William H., GURPS Steampunk (2000)  Raypunk  Raypunk (or more commonly \\"Raygun gothic\\") is a distinctive (sub)genre which deals with scenarios, technologies, beings or environments, very different from everything that we know or what is possible here on Earth or by science. Covers space surrealism, parallel worlds, alien art, technological psychedelia, non-standard \\"science\\", alternative or distorted/twisted reality and so on. Predecessor to atompunk with similar \\"cosmic\\" themes but mostly without explicit nuclear power or exactly described technology and with more archaic/schematic/artistic style, dark, obscure, cheesy, weird, mysterious, dreamy, hazy or etheric atmosphere (origins before 1880-1950), parallel to steampunk, dieselpunk and teslapunk. While not originally designed as such, the original Star Trek series has an aesthetic very reminiscent of raypunk. The comic book series The Manhattan Projects, and the pre-WWII Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon comics and serials would be examples of raypunk.  Nowpunk  Nowpunk is a term invented by Bruce Sterling, which he applied to contemporary fiction set in the time period (particularly in the post-Cold War 1990s to the present) in which the fiction is being published, i.e. all contemporary fiction. Sterling used the term to describe his book The Zenith Angle, which follows the story of a hacker whose life is changed by the September 11, 2001 attacks.  Cyberprep  Cyberprep is a term with a very similar meaning to postcyberpunk. The word is an amalgam of the prefix \\"cyber-\\", referring to cybernetics, and \\"preppy\\", reflecting its divergence from the punk elements of cyberpunk. A cyberprep world assumes that all the technological advancements of cyberpunk speculation have taken place but life is utopian rather than gritty and dangerous.Blankenship, Loyd. (1995) GURPS Cyberpunk: High-Tech Low- Life Rolepaying Sourcebook. Steve Jackson Games. Since society is largely leisure-driven, advanced body modifications are used for sports, pleasure and self-improvement. An example would be Scott Westerfeld's Uglies series.  Solarpunk  Solarpunk is a movement, a subgenre, and an alternative to cyberpunk fiction that encourages optimistic envisioning of the future in light of present environmental concerns, such as climate change and pollution, as well as social inequality. Solarpunk fiction ‚Äî which includes novels, short stories, and poetry ‚Äî imagines futures that address environmental concerns with varying degrees of optimism. One example is News from Gardenia by actor- writer Robert Llewellyn.https://www.amazon.co.uk/News-Gardenia-Robert- Llewellyn/dp/1908717122/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid;=&sr;=  Lunarpunk  Lunarpunk is the dark reflection of Solarpunk.https://solarisrebellio.tumblr.com/post/169965831701/whats- solarpunk-and-lunarpunk-it-is-something Basically, it understands the human race as a invasive species. As seen in the movie Avatar (2009) by James Cameron, the genre is about living in unison with nature. Spiritualization is very present and nature is seen as a deity of sorts. It can be defined as \\"Wiccan Solarpunk\\". Aesthetically, Lunarpunk usually is presented with pinks and purples with an almost ominipresence of bioluminescent plants and especially mushrooms.https://solarpunkdruid.com/2019/07/19/what-is-lunarpunk/  Other proposed fantastic fiction derivatives = Elfpunk  Elfpunk is subgenre of urban fantasy in which traditional mythological creatures such as faeries and elves are transplanted from rural folklore into modern urban settings and has been seen in books since the 1980s including works such as War of the Oaks by Emma Bull, Gossamer Axe by Gael Baudino, Artemis Fowl by Eoin Colfer, and The Iron Dragons' Daughter by Michael Swanwick. During the awards ceremony for the 2007 National Book Awards, judge Elizabeth Partridge expounded on the distinction between elfpunk and urban fantasy, citing fellow judge Scott Westerfeld's thoughts on the works of Holly Black who is considered \\"classic elfpunk‚Äîthere's enough creatures already, and she's using them. Urban fantasy, though, can have some totally made-up f*cked-up creatures\\". The 2020 Pixar animated film Onward is an example of an elfpunk film, set in a \\"suburban fantasy world\\" that combines modern and mythic elements.  Mythpunk  Catherynne M. Valente uses the term \\"mythpunk\\" to describe a subgenre of mythic fiction which starts in folklore and myth and adds elements of postmodern literary techniques. As the -punk appendage implies, mythpunk is subversive. In particular, it uses aspects of folklore to subvert or question dominant societal norms, often bringing in a feminist and/or multicultural approach. It confronts, instead of conforms to, societal norms. Valente describes mythpunk as breaking \\"mythologies that defined a universe where women, queer folk, people of color, people who deviate from the norm were invisible or never existed\\" and then \\"piecing it back together to make something strange and different and wild\\". Typically, mythpunk narratives focus on transforming folkloric source material rather than retelling it, often through postmodern literary techniques such as non-linear storytelling, worldbuilding, confessional poetry, as well as modern linguistic and literary devices. The use of folklore is especially important because folklore is \\"often a battleground between subversive and conservative forces\\" and a medium for constructing new societal norms. Through postmodern literary techniques, mythpunk authors change the structures and traditions of folklore, \\"negotiating‚Äîand validating‚Äîdifferent norms\\". Most works of mythpunk have been published by small presses, such as Strange Horizons, because \\"anything playing out on the edge is going to have truck with the small presses at some point, because small presses take big risks\\".

He served as a British army paratrooper during the Cyprus Emergency and a United States commissioned officer in the Vietnam War. He rose to the rank of colonel in the United States Army. As the director of security for the financial services firm Morgan Stanley at the World Trade Center,\\"Rick Rescorla, Security Manager and Hero\\", BBC, June 1, 2006. Rescorla anticipated attacks on the towers and implemented evacuation procedures credited with saving thousands of lives. He died during the attacks of September 11, 2001, while leading evacuees from the South Tower. Early life Rescorla was born in Hayle, Cornwall, on May 27, 1939. He grew up there with his grandparents and his mother, who worked as a housekeeper and companion to the elderly. In 1943, Hayle served as headquarters for the 175th Infantry Regiment of the U.S. 29th Infantry Division, largely composed of U.S. soldiers from Maryland and Virginia preparing for the D-Day invasion of Normandy. Young Rescorla idolized the U.S. soldiers and wanted to become a soldier because of them. Rescorla was a natural sportsman, setting a school record in the shot put, and was an avid boxer. When a professional boxing match was scheduled between a British boxer and a U.S. heavyweight contender named Tami Mauriello, his friends backed the Briton. Rescorla said \\"I'm for Tammy\\" [sic] and after Mauriello won the fight everyone in Hayle knew him as \\"Tammy\\".Stewart, James B., The Heart of a Soldier, Simon & Schuster, New York, 2002, Chapter 2. UK military In 1956, at age 16, Rescorla left Hayle to join the army. At the time, Britain practiced conscription (known as National Service), which required every young man to serve for two years in the Armed Forces. Rescorla, however, chose instead to volunteer. This required him to serve three years, though the conditions for volunteers were considered to be better than those of conscripted soldiers. He enlisted in the British Army in 1957, training as a paratrooper with The Parachute Regiment and then serving with an intelligence unit in Cyprus during the EOKA Cypriot insurgency from 1957 to 1960. Rescorla's British medals included the General Service Medal (1918) with clasp Cyprus. *60px General Service Medal (1918) with clasp Cyprus Northern Rhodesia Police At the end of his Short-Service Commission, Rescorla joined the Northern Rhodesia Police (now the Zambia Police Service) as a police inspector on a three-year contract from 1960 to 1963, experiences that made him a fierce anti-Communist. It was during the latter post that he met and forged a \\"life-altering friendship\\" with American soldier Daniel J. Hill, who inspired Rescorla to later join the U.S. Army to fight in Vietnam against the communists. On returning to London he quickly joined the Metropolitan Police Service. His tenure at the Met was short-lived and he soon resigned and moved to the United States. U.S. military Upon arrival in the USA, Rescorla lived at a YMCA hostel in Brooklyn until he was able to enlist in the army. \\"Rick\\", as he would thereafter be known, enlisted in the United States Army in 1963 and after basic training at Fort Dix, he attended Officer Candidate School and airborne training at Fort Benning. Upon graduation, Rescorla was assigned as a platoon leader in the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile). Rescorla was sent to Vietnam, where he served under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore. The two participated in the 1965 Battle of Ia Drang, which Moore would later describe in a 1992 book he co-authored We Were Soldiers Once‚Ä¶ And Young, (from which the 2002 Mel Gibson film We Were Soldiers would be adapted); Rescorla is the soldier pictured on the book jacket cover. Co-author Lieutenant General Hal Moore described him as \\"the best platoon leader I ever saw\\". Rescorla's men nicknamed him \\"Hard Core\\" for his bravery in battle and revered him for his good humor and compassion toward his men.Moore, Harold G.; Galloway, Joseph L. (2009), We Are Soldiers Still: A Journey Back to the Battlefields of Vietnam, Harper Perennial, 2009. . pg. 212. He also is mentioned in the book Baptism by Larry Gwin who also fought at Ia Drang. The fourteenth chapter of the book Rescorla's Game describes him as the \\"Cornish Hawk\\". Despite this tough image, according to his second wife and widow Susan Rescorla in her book, Touched by a Hero, music was \\"so central\\" to Rick's life that he sang to his troops in Vietnam to calm them ‚Äì something he would later employ during 9/11 evacuations. Rescorla's Vietnam War honors included the Silver Star, the Bronze Star with Oak Leaf Cluster, a Purple Heart and the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry. *60px Silver Star *60px Bronze Star with one oak leaf cluster *60px Purple Heart *60px Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry He left active duty in 1967 and reached the rank of Colonel in the United States Army Reserve before retiring from the military in 1990. In April 2001, Rescorla was chosen for induction into the Infantry Officer Candidate School Hall of Fame and was invited to participate in ceremonies at Fort Benning. Post-military education and teaching career After service in Vietnam, Rescorla returned to the U.S. and used his military benefits to study creative writing at the University of Oklahoma, eventually earning a bachelor of arts degree, followed by a master of arts degree in English,Ripley, Amanda (May 29, 2008). \\"A Survival Guide to Catastrophe\\". Time. Page 3 of 4. and his law degree from the Oklahoma City University School of Law. He then moved to South Carolina, where he taught criminal justice at the University of South Carolina for three years and published a textbook on the subject. Corporate security career Rescorla left teaching for higher- paying jobs in corporate security. Moving to New Jersey, in 1985, he joined Dean Witter Reynolds at their offices at the World Trade Center in Manhattan. After the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, Rescorla worried about a terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. Because his old American friend from Northern Rhodesia, Daniel Hill, was trained in counterterrorism, in 1990, Rescorla asked him to visit the World Trade Center to assess its security. When Rescorla asked Hill how he would attack the building were he a terrorist, Hill asked to see the basement, and after the two walked down to the basement parking garage without being stopped by any visible security, Hill pointed to an easily accessible load-bearing column, and said, \\"This is a soft touch. I‚Äôd drive a truck full of explosives in here, walk out, and light it off.\\" That year, Rescorla and Hill wrote a report to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the site, insisting on the need for more security in the parking garage. Their recommendations, which would have been expensive to implement, were ignored, according to James B. Stewart's biography of Rescorla, Heart of a Soldier. Following the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, Rescorla invited Hill to New York, where he hired him as a security consultant in order to analyze the building's security. Although no arrests had yet been made in the case, Rescorla suspected that the bomb had been planted by Muslim terrorists, probably Palestinians, or that an Iraqi colonel of engineers might have orchestrated the attack. Hill let his beard grow and visited several mosques in New Jersey, showing up for morning prayers at dawn. Speaking fluent Arabic, he took on the character of an anti- American Muslim in order to infiltrate and interview the other visitors to the mosques. He concluded that the attack was likely planned by a radical imam at a mosque in New York or New Jersey. Subsequently, followers of Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, a radical Muslim cleric based in Brooklyn, were convicted of the bombing. Rescorla gained credibility and authority after the bombing, which resulted in a change to the culture of Morgan Stanley. Rescorla wanted the company out of the building because he continued to feel, as did Hill, that the World Trade Center was still a target for terrorists and that the next attack could involve a plane crashing into one of the towers.Stewart (2002), chapter 11. He recommended to his superiors at Morgan Stanley that the company leave Manhattan office space, mentioning that labor costs were lower in New Jersey and that the firm's employees and equipment would be safer in a proposed four-story building. However, this recommendation was not followed because the company's lease at the World Trade Center would not terminate until 2006. At Rescorla's insistence, all employees, including senior executives, then practiced emergency evacuations every three months.The Man Who Predicted 9/11. 2002. History After Dean Witter merged with Morgan Stanley in 1997, the company eventually occupied twenty-two floors in the South Tower and several floors in a building nearby. Rescorla's office was on the forty- fourth floor of the South Tower. Feeling that the authorities lost legitimacy after they failed to respond to his 1990 warnings, he concluded that employees of Morgan Stanley, which was the largest tenant in the World Trade Center, could not rely on first responders in an emergency, and needed to empower themselves through surprise fire drills, in which he trained employees to meet in the hallway between stairwells and go down the stairs, two by two, to the 44th floor. Rescorla's strict approach to these drills put him into conflict with some high-powered executives who resented the interruption to their daily activities, but he nonetheless insisted that these rehearsals were necessary to train the employees in the event of an emergency. He timed employees with a stopwatch when they moved too slowly and lectured them on fire emergency basics. Rescorla and Hill were also critical of the police response during the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, commenting, \\"The police were sitting outside while kids were getting killed. They should have put themselves between the perpetrators and the victims. That was abject cowardice.\\" Rescorla felt that if he and Hill were younger, they \\"could have flown to Colorado, gone in that building, and ended it before the law did.\\" September 11, 2001 Rick Rescorla Memorial in Hayle, Cornwall At 8:46 a.m. on the morning of September 11, 2001, American Airlines Flight 11 struck the North Tower of the World Trade Center (Tower 1). Rescorla heard the explosion and saw the tower burning from his office window in the 44th floor of the South Tower (Tower 2). When a Port Authority announcement came over the P.A. system urging people to stay at their desks, Rescorla ignored the announcement, grabbed his bullhorn, walkie-talkie, and cell phone, and began systematically ordering Morgan Stanley employees to evacuate, including the 1,000 employees in WTC 5. He directed people down a stairwell from the 44th floor, continuing to calm employees after the building lurched violently following the crash of United Airlines Flight 175 38 floors above into Tower 2 at 9:03 A.M. Morgan Stanley executive Bill McMahon stated that even a group of 250 people visiting the offices for a stockbroker training class knew what to do because they had been shown the nearest stairway. Rescorla had boosted morale among his men in Vietnam by singing Cornish songs from his youth, and now he did the same in the stairwell, singing songs such as one based on the Welsh song \\"Men of Harlech\\": \\"Men of Cornwall stop your dreaming, Can‚Äôt you see their spearpoints gleaming? See their warriors‚Äô pennants streaming, To this battlefield. Men of Cornwall stand ye steady, It cannot be ever said ye For the battle were not ready. Stand and never yield!\\" Between songs, Rescorla called his wife, telling her, \\"Stop crying. I have to get these people out safely. If something should happen to me, I want you to know I've never been happier. You made my life.\\" After successfully evacuating most of Morgan Stanley's 2,687 employees, he went back into the building.Ripley, 2008. Time.

When one of his colleagues told him he too had to evacuate the World Trade Center, Rescorla replied, \\"As soon as I make sure everyone else is out.\\"Ripley, Amanda. The Unthinkable: Who Survives When Disaster Strikes‚ÄîAnd Why. Crown Books, New York, 2008, p. 210. He was last seen on the 10th floor, heading upward, shortly before the South Tower collapsed at 9:59 A.M. His remains were never found. Rescorla was declared dead three weeks after the attacks. Personal life Rescorla and his first wife, Betsy, met as students at the University of Oklahoma. They married in Dallas in 1972. Their first child was born in South Carolina in 1976. Their second child was born in 1978, while they were living in Chicago. The family then moved to New Jersey. Rescorla and Betsy divorced after their children were grown. In 1994, Rescorla was diagnosed with prostate cancer and underwent surgery to remove his prostate. Initially, the prognosis was positive, but by 1998 the cancer had spread to his bone marrow. He underwent treatment, which involved painful injections directly into his stomach every month and taking prescribed medications that dehydrated him and caused his body to swell. He also employed traditional Chinese medicine and meditation. In late July 1998 while jogging Rescorla met his second wife, Susan Greer, near her Morristown, New Jersey home. She was an assistant to a dean at Fairleigh Dickinson University and a twice-divorced mother of three daughters. Rescorla had been living in the area to be near his children after his divorce. Susan first spoke to him to ask him why he was jogging barefoot, an practice he picked up in Northern Rhodesia, where few natives had worn shoes and because of which, he had begun out of curiosity. Rescorla also mentioned to Greer that he was writing a play, Mkubwa Junction, which was set in Northern Rhodesia and based on his time there. The two moved into a Morristown townhouse together that October. They were married on February 20, 1999, in St. Augustine, Florida, where his longtime friend, Daniel Hill, had lived since 1975. Hill would serve as Rescorla'a best man for the second time. Rescorla also chose St. Augustine because he wanted to be married somewhere near the sea, to remind him of his homeland of Cornwall. They later honeymooned in Hayle, Cornwall, in May 2000. During this time Rescorla exhibited a positive outlook about his cancer. Rescorla was fond of the food and the culture of the Portuguese community in Newark, New Jersey and was learning to speak Portuguese, in addition to Arabic. He also was fascinated with the American West and was interested in experiencing the spiritual aspects of AmerIndian culture. He and Susan participated in yoga, ballroom dancing, and studying Italian together. Rescorla was survived by his wife, Susan, his two children, and his three stepdaughters by Susan.Reich, Ronni (September 10, 2011). \\"A 9/11 hero's epic love is brought to life in opera\\". NJ.com. Rescorla had requested that he be cremated, and his ashes be strewn in Hayle. Having revered the eagle as a symbol of both American freedom and Native American mysticism, he had also told Susan that when he died he wanted her to contribute money to an endowment for eagles. Tributes Rescorla's name is located on Panel S-46 of the National September 11 Memorial‚Äôs South Pool. Rescorla was uncomfortable about being portrayed as a war hero. Although he had given some interviews to his Vietnam commander, Harold Moore, for his 1992 book, We Were Soldiers Once‚Ä¶ And Young, Rescorla chose not to read it when he saw that its cover featured a combat photograph of him. When he learned that the book was being made into a film starring Mel Gibson, he told his wife, Susan that he had no intention of seeing it, as he felt uncomfortable with anything that portrayed him, or other survivors as war heroes, commenting, \\"The real heroes are dead.\\" Nevertheless, Rescorla's activities during the September 11 attacks were quickly brought to national attention by the news media, including a detailed account by Michael Grunwald in the October 28, 2001 edition of The Washington Post of Rescorla's life and \\"epic death, one of those inspirational hero-tales that have sprouted like wildflowers from the Twin Towers rubble.\\" Other memorials and tributes to Rescorla include: *At a small, brief memorial service attended by family and a few close friends on October 27, Susan recited \\"The White Rose\\", a Cornish folk song that Rescorla was fond of, and a hawk that had recently been restored to health was released into freedom. *The Morristown police paid tribute to Rescorla at a fund-raising dinner.

Two distinct and geographically separate neighbourhoods about apart on opposite sides of the White Cart Water are known by the Crookston name, owing to factors in their development. Both areas share the same main road (A736 Crookston Road) and fall within the same U.K. and Scottish Parliamentary constituencies (as of 2019 boundaries), but the northern area falls under the Cardonald ward for Glasgow City Council and is within the G52 postcode zone, while the southern area is in the Greater Pollok ward and the G53 postcode zone.

Sluga (; born April 24, 1937) is a German academic. Since 1970, Sluga has been a professor of philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley, and since 2009 he has been the William and Trudy Ausfahl Professor of Philosophy there.https://philosophy.berkeley.edu/people/page/37 He previously served as a lecturer in philosophy at University College London. He teaches and writes on topics in analytic philosophy as well as on political philosophy and has been particularly influenced by the thought of Gottlob Frege, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Martin Heidegger, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Michel Foucault. Education He studied at the University of Bonn and the University of Munich. He subsequently obtained a BPhilSluga's homepage at Berkeley at Oxford, where he studied under R. M. Hare, Isaiah Berlin, Gilbert Ryle and Michael Dummett.Sluga's webpage at Stanford He describes his philosophical orientation as follows: \\"My overall philosophical outlook is radically historicist. I believe that we can understand ourselves only as beings with a particular evolution and history.\\" Philosophical work Sluga has worked extensively on the early history of analytic philosophy. In his writings on Gottlob Frege he has sought to establish the influence of Immanuel Kant, Hermann Lotze, and of Neo-Kantians like Cuno Fischer and Wilhelm Windelband on Frege's views on the foundations of mathematics and in the theory of meaning. This historically oriented approach to Frege's thought brought him into sharp conflict with Michael Dummett's \\"realist\\" interpretation of Frege. Sluga's work in analytic philosophy has been influenced substantially by his engagement with Wittgenstein to whose early and late writings he has devoted a number of studies. His writings on both Frege and Wittgenstein have contributed to the development of the study of the history of analytic philosophy as a field within analytic philosophy. Since the early 1990s Sluga has become increasingly concerned with political philosophy. In Heidegger's Crisis he set out to explore the question why philosophers from Plato till the present get so often entangled in dangerous political affairs. Sluga analyzes Heidegger's political engagement by putting it into the larger context of the development of German philosophy in the Nazi period. He seeks to show thereby that many diagnoses of Heidegger's politics are misdirected because of their overly narrow focus on the person and work of Heidegger. He challenges, in particular, the claim that Heidegger's critique of reason is to blame for his political errors by pointing out that committed \\"rationalists\\" among the German philosophers were prone to the same errors. Sluga's book seeks to show that the willingness to involve themselves politically not only Heidegger, but also of Neo-Kantians like Bruno Bauch, Neo-Fichteans like Max Wundt, and Nietzscheans like Alfred Baeumler was ultimately due to their misconceived belief that they were living through a moment of world-historical crisis in which they were particularly called upon to intervene. His book Politics and the Search for the Common Good seeks to re-think politics in substantially new terms. Sluga distinguishes in it between a long tradition of \\"normative political theorizing\\" that ranges from Plato and Aristotle through Kant to contemporary writers like John Rawls and a more recent form of \\"diagnostic practice\\" that emerged in the 19th century and whose first practitioners were Karl Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche. Diagnostic political philosophy, Sluga argues, does not seek to establish political norms through a process of abstract philosophical reasoning but seeks to reach practical conclusions through a careful diagnosis of the political realities. Identifying himself with this strand of political philosophizing, Sluga proceeds to examine the thinking of Carl Schmitt, Hannah Arendt, and Michel Foucault as 20th century exemplars of the diagnostic approach. The book seeks to highlight the promise and the achievements of the diagnostic method as well as its shortcomings so far and its inherent limitations. In doing so, Sluga maps out an understanding of politics that makes use of some of Wittgenstein's methodological concepts. He characterizes politics as a family resemblance phenomenon and argues that the concept of politics does not identify a natural kind. It is therefore also mistaken to assume that there is a single common good at which all politics aims. Similarly, we must forgo the belief that there is a best form of government (as, e.g., democracy). Politics must, rather, be conceived as a continuous search for a common good which can have no final, conclusive answer. It is a sphere of uncertainty in which we operate always with a radically incomplete and unreliable picture of where we are and with only shifting ideas of where we want to go. The institutional forms that this search takes will change over time. Sluga agrees with other diagnostic thinkers that the classical institution of the modern state is now giving way to a new form of political order which he calls \\"the corporƒÅte,\\" whose challenges are defined by the growth of human populations, rapid technological changes, and an ever more pressing environmental crisis.

Unlike their herbaceous modern cousins, these plants were medium-sized trees, growing to heights of 30-50 meters (100-160 feet). They were components of the understories of coal swamps of the Carboniferous Period (around ). Taxonomy A number of organ taxa have been identified as part of a united organism, which has inherited the name Calamites in popular culture. Calamites correctly refers only to casts of the stem of Carboniferous/Permian sphenophytes, and as such is a form genus of little taxonomic value. There are two forms of casts, which can give mistaken impressions of the organisms. The most common is an internal cast of the hollow (or pith-filled) void in the centre of the trunk. This can cause some confusion: firstly, it must be remembered that a fossil was probably surrounded with 4-5 times its width in (unpreserved) vascular tissue, so the organisms were much wider than the internal casts preserved. Further, the fossil gets narrower as it attaches to a rhizoid, a place where one would expect there to be the highest concentration of vascular tissue (as this is where the peak transport occurs). However, because the fossil is a cast, the narrowing in fact represents a constriction of the cavity, into which vascular tubes encroach as they widen. Further organ genera belonging to sphenophytes include: * Arthropitys (stems which are preserved in a mineralised form) * Astromyelon (permineralised rhizomes, distinguished from Arthropitys by the absence of a carinal canal) * Annularia and Asterophylites (form genera of leaf-whorls which are paraphyletic).  Anatomy  The foliage (Annularia) of Calamites The trunks of Calamites had a distinctive segmented, bamboo-like appearance and vertical ribbing. The branches, leaves and cones were all borne in whorls. The leaves were needle-shaped, with up to 25 per whorl. Their trunks produced secondary xylem, meaning they were made of wood. The vascular cambium of Calamites was unifacial, producing secondary xylem towards the stem center, but not secondary phloem. The stems of modern horsetails are typically hollow or contain numerous elongated air-filled sacs. Calamites was similar in that its trunk and stems were hollow, like wooden tubes. When these trunks buckled and broke, they could fill with sediment. This is the reason pith casts of the inside of Calamites stems are so common as fossils. Calamitaceae - Annularia stellata.JPGSpecimen of Annularia stellata from Italy on display at the Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Milano Calamites reconstrucci√≥n.pngReconstruction of a whole Calamites tree with Annularia.  Reproduction  A Calamites rhizoid Calamites reproduced by means of spores, which were produced in small sacs organized into cones. They are also known to have possessed massive underground rhizomes, which allowed for the production of clones of one tree. This is the only group of trees of their period known to have a clonal habit. This type of asexual reproduction would allow them to spread quickly into new territory, and help to anchor them firmly in the unstable ground along rivers and in newly deposited delta sediments. The rhizomes of Calamites look quite similar to the stems in most cases, but have nodes that get progressively closer together as they approach the apical area (the growth tip that spreads outward through the soil).  Different forms  Calamites come in a variety of different \\"form genera\\". One type, Calamites suckowi, is distinguishable from other Calamites forms by its prominent, swollen nodes and relatively wide-spaced longitudinal ribs. Another example, Calamites cisti, has much smaller nodes and the ribs are typically closer together. In addition, the distance between successive node lines on a Calamites suckowi specimen is typically much wider than the diameter. In other forms like Calamites cisti, the opposite is true or the specimen is just slightly wider than the diameter. However, the value of these form taxa is limited. The distance between nodes, for example, is highly variable, and an intercalary meristem means that this distance varied as the organisms grew.  Extinction and classification  The genus Calamites is placed in the family Calamitaceae in the plant class Equisetopsida (formerly known as Sphenophyta) in the fern allies division Pteridophyta. The Calamitaceae finally became extinct in the Lower Permian, a time which also saw the origin and diversification of the herbaceous genus Equisetum, the only living sphenophyte genus.

The first usage refers to a pair of metabolic states (hypoglycemia plus ketosis) that can have many causes, while the second usage refers to a specific \\"disease\\" called ketotic hypoglycemia. Ketotic hypoglycemia more commonly refers to a common but mysterious \\"disease\\" of recurrent hypoglycemic symptoms with ketosis in young children. The cause and the homogeneity of the condition remain uncertain,Marcus et al., \\"Insufficient Ketone Body Use Is the Cause of Ketotic Hypoglycemia in One of a Pair of Homozygotic Twins,\\" Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism. August 2007. but a characteristic presentation, precipitating factors, diagnostic test results, treatment, and natural history can be described. It remains one of the more common causes of hypoglycemia in the age range.Robert P Hoffman. \\"Pediatric Hypoglycemia.\\" Medscape Reference. Updated November 4, 2009. Presentation The typical patient with ketotic hypoglycemia is a young child between the ages of 10 months and 4 years. Episodes nearly always occur in the morning after an overnight fast, often one that is longer than usual. Symptoms include those of neuroglycopenia, ketosis, or both. The neuroglycopenic symptoms usually include lethargy and malaise, but may include unresponsiveness or seizures. The principal symptoms of ketosis are anorexia, abdominal discomfort, and nausea, sometimes progressing to vomiting. If severe, parents usually take the child to a local emergency department, where blood is drawn. The glucose is usually found to be between 35 and 60 mg/dl (1.8-3.1 mmol/L). The total CO2 is usually somewhat low as well, (14-19 mmol/L is typical), and if urine is obtained, high levels of ketones are discovered. Ketones can also be measured in the blood at the bedside (Medisense glucometer). Other routine tests are normal. If given intravenous fluids with saline and dextrose, the child improves dramatically and is usually restored to normal health within a few hours. These symptoms are normally seen because of the child being unadapted to using fat as energy, typically when the child's daily glucose intake might be too high (more than 50g/day for a child). This is also associated with fluctuant glycemia throughout the day. A first episode is usually attributed to a viral infection or acute gastroenteritis. However, in most of these children one or more additional episodes recur over next few years and become immediately recognizable to the parents. In mild cases, carbohydrates and a few hours of sleep will be enough to end the symptoms. Thus said, the required amount of carbohydrate intake of a child, as well as for an adult is close to 0, because the liver can supply the required glucose quantity needed for the body through gluconeogenesis. Precipitating factors, conditions that trigger an episode, may include extended fasting (e.g., missing supper the night before), a low carbohydrate intake the previous day (e.g., a hot dog without a bun), or stress such as a viral infection. Most children affected by ketotic hypoglycemia have a slender build, many with a weight percentile below height percentile, though without other evidence of malnutrition. Overweight children are rarely affected. Ketotic hypoglycemia in glycogen storage disease Some of the subtypes of glycogen storage disease show ketotic hypoglycemia after fasting periods. Especially glycogen storage disease type IX can be a common cause for ketotic hypoglycemia, with the most common sub-type IXa mainly affecting boys. Brown et al., \\"Evaluation of glycogen storage disease as a cause of ketotic hypoglycemia in children\\", Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease. May 2015. With glycogen storage disease type XIa, children can usually appear overweight for height, but this is attributed to an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly). Cause There are hundreds of causes of hypoglycemia. Normally, the defensive, physiological response to a falling blood glucose is reduction of insulin secretion to undetectable levels, and release of glucagon, adrenaline, and other counterregulatory hormones. This shift of hormones initiates glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver, and lipolysis in adipose tissue. Lipids are metabolized to triglycerides, in turn to fatty acids, which are transformed in the mitochondria of liver and kidney cells to the ketone bodies‚Äî acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and acetone. Ketones can be used by the brain as an alternate fuel when glucose is scarce. A high level of ketones in the blood, ketosis, is thus a normal response to hypoglycemia in healthy people of all ages. The presence or absence of ketosis is therefore an important clue to the cause of hypoglycemia in an individual patient. Absence of ketosis (\\"nonketotic hypoglycemia\\") most often indicates excessive insulin as the cause of the hypoglycemia. Less commonly, it may indicate a fatty acid oxidation disorder. Natural history Children \\"outgrow\\" ketotic hypoglycemia, presumably because fasting tolerance improves as body mass increases. In most the episodes become milder and more infrequent by 4 to 5 years of age and rarely occur after age 9.Hoffmann et al., ed. \\"Inherited Metabolic Diseases: A Clinical Approach,\\" Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg, 2010. Onset of hypoglycemia with ketosis after age 5 or persistence after age 7 should elicit referral and an intensive search for a more specific disease. Diagnosis The diagnosis is based on a combination of typical clinical features and exclusion by a pediatric endocrinologist of other causes of \\"hypoglycemia with ketosis,\\" especially growth hormone deficiency, hypopituitarism, adrenal insufficiency, and identifiable inborn errors of metabolism such as organic acidoses. The most useful diagnostic tests include measurement of insulin, growth hormone, cortisol, and lactic acid at the time of the hypoglycemia. Plasma acylcarnitine levels and urine organic acids exclude some of the important metabolic diseases. When the episodes are recurrent or severe, the definitive test is a hospitalization for a supervised diagnostic fast. This usually demonstrates \\"accelerated fasting\\"‚Äîa shorter time until the glucose begins to fall, but normal metabolic and counterregulatory responses as the glucose falls. As the glucose reaches hypoglycemic levels, the insulin is undetectable, counterregulatory hormones, fatty acids, and ketones are high, and glucagon injection elicits no rise of glucose. Treatment Once ketotic hypoglycemia is suspected and other conditions excluded, appropriate treatment reduces the frequency and duration of episodes. Extended fasts should be avoided. The child should be given a bedtime snack of carbohydrates (e.g. spaghetti or pasta or milk) and should be awakened and fed after the usual duration of sleep. If the child is underweight, a daily nutritional supplement may be recommended. Raw cornstarch dissolved in a beverage helps individuals with hypoglycemia, especially that caused by Glycogen Storage Disease, sustain their blood sugars for longer periods of time and may be given at bedtime. If a spell begins, carbohydrates and fluids should be given promptly. If vomiting prevents this, the child should be taken to the local emergency department for a few hours of intravenous saline and dextrose. This treatment is often expedited by supplying the parents with a letter describing the condition and recommended treatment.

Glucose Counterregulation  The action of insulin is counterregulated by glucagon, epinephrine (adrenaline), norepinephrine (noradrenaline), cortisol, and growth hormone. These counterregulatory hormones‚Äîthe term is usually used in the plural‚Äîraise the level of glucose in the blood by promoting glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, ketogenesis, and other catabolic processes. In healthy people, counterregulatory hormones constitute a principal defense against hypoglycemia, and levels are expected to rise as the glucose falls. As an example, the exercise-induced reduction in blood glucose is counterregulated by increases in levels of epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol, and growth hormone. The rise in blood concentrations of these counterregulatory hormones is dependent upon both exercise intensity and duration, and is proportional to the rate of glucose uptake by the contracting skeletal muscle.  Blood Pressure Counterregulation  Similarly, the natriuretic peptides counterregulate against renin, angiotensin, and aldosterone which elevate blood pressure.  Reproductive Counterregulation  In the reproductive system, inhibins and follistatin counterregulate activins, to control follicle-stimulating hormone and so the release of gonads. Inhibins and activins also regulate bone mass.

They are commonly known as horsetails. They typically grow in wet areas, with whorls of needle-like branches radiating at regular intervals from a single vertical stem. The Equisetidae were formerly regarded as a separate division of spore plants and called Equisetophyta, Arthrophyta, Calamophyta or Sphenophyta. When treated as a class, the names Equisetopsida s.s. and Sphenopsida have also been used. They are now recognized as rather close relatives of the ferns (Polypodiopsida) of which they form a specialized lineage. However, the division between the horsetails and the other ferns is so ancient that many botanists, especially paleobotanists, still regard this group as fundamentally separate at the higher level. Description The horsetails comprise photosynthesising, \\"segmented\\", hollow stems, sometimes filled with pith. At the junction (\\"node\\", see diagram) between each segment is a whorl of leaves. In the only extant genus Equisetum, these are small leaves (microphylls) with a singular vascular trace, fused into a sheath at each stem node. However, the leaves of Equisetum probably arose by the reduction of megaphylls, as evidenced by early fossil forms such as Sphenophyllum, in which the leaves are broad with branching veins. The vascular bundles trifurcate at the nodes, with the central branch becoming the vein of a microphyll, and the other two moving left and right to merge with the new branches of their neighbours. The vascular system itself resembles that of the vascular plants' eustele, which evolved independently and convergently. Very rapid internode elongation results in the formation of a pith cavity and a ring of carinal canals formed by disruption of the primary xylem. Similar spaces, the vallecular canals are formed in the cortex. Due to the softer nature of the phloem, these are very rarely seen in fossil instances. In the Calamitaceae, secondary xylem (but not secondary phloem) was secreted as the cambium grew outwards, producing a woody stem, and allowing the plants to grow as high as 10m. All extant species of Equisetum are herbaceous, and have lost the ability to produce secondary growth. The underground parts of the plants consist of jointed rhizomes, from which roots and aerial axes emerge. The plants have intercalary meristems in each segment of the stem and rhizome that grow as the plant gets taller. This contrasts with the seed plants, which grow from an apical meristem - i.e. new growth comes only from growing tips (and widening of stems). Horsetails bear cones (technically strobili, sing. strobilus) at the tips of some stems. These cones comprise spirally arranged sporangiophores, which bear sporangia at their edges, and in extant horsetails cover the spores externally - like sacs hanging from an umbrella, with its handle embedded in the axis of the cone. In extinct groups, further protection was afforded to the spores by the presence of whorls of bracts - big pointed microphylls protruding from the cone. The extant horsetails are homosporous, but extinct heterosporous species such as Calamostachys casheana appear in the fossil record. The sporangia open by lateral dehiscence to release the spores. The spores bear characteristic elaters, distinctive spring-like attachments which are hygroscopic: i.e. they change their configuration in the presence of water, helping the spores move and aiding their dispersal. Vegetative stem: N = node, I = internode, B = branch in whorl, L = fused microphylls Cross-section through a strobilus; sporangiophores, with attached sporangia (spore capsules) full of spores, can be discerned. Strobilus of E. telmateia, terminal on an unbranched stem  Taxonomy =Classification The horsetails and their fossil relatives were long been recognized as distinct from other seedless vascular plants, such as the ferns (Polypodiopsida). Before the advent of modern molecular studies, the relationship of this group to other living and fossil plants was considered problematic. Because of their unclear relationships, the rank botanists assigned to the horsetails varied from order to division. When recognized as a separate division, the literature uses many possible names, including Arthrophyta, Calamophyta, Sphenophyta, or Equisetophyta. Other authors regarded the same group as a class, either within a division consisting of the vascular plants or, more recently, within an expanded fern group. When ranked as a class, the group has been termed the Equisetopsida or Sphenopsida. Modern phylogenetic analysis, back to 2001, demonstrated that horsetails belong firmly within the fern clade of vascular plants. Smith et al. (2006) carried out the first higher-level pteridophyte classification published in the molecular phylogenetic era, and considered the ferns (monilophytes), to comprise four classes, with the horsetails as class Equisetopsida sensu stricto. (This distinction is necessary because of the alternative usage of Equisetopsida sensu lato as a synonym for all land plants (Embryophyta) with rank of class.) Chase and Reveal (2009) treated the horsetails as subclass Equisetidae of class Equisetopsida sensu lato. The consensus classification produced by the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group in 2016 also places horsetails in the subclass Equisetidae, but in the class Polypodiopsida (ferns broadly defined). Phylogeny The following diagram shows a likely phylogenic relationship between subclass Equisetidae and the other fern subclasses according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group. A 2018 study by Elgorriaga et al. suggests the relationships within the Equisetidae are as shown in the following cladogram. According to the study, the age of the crown group of Equisetum dates at least to the Early Cretaceous, and most probably up to the Jurassic.  Subdivision  Subclass Equisetidae contains a single extant order, Equisetales. This order consists of a single monotypic family, Equisetaceae, with one genus Equisetum. Equisetum has about 20 species.  Fossil record  The extant horsetails represent a tiny fraction of horsetail diversity in the past. There were three orders of the Equisetidae. The Pseudoborniales first appeared in the late Devonian. The Sphenophyllales were a dominant member of the Carboniferous understory, and prospered until the mid and early Permian. The Equisetales existed alongside the Sphenophyllales, but diversified as that group disappeared into extinction, gradually dwindling in diversity to today's single genus Equisetum. The organisms first appear in the fossil record during the late Devonian, a time when land plants were undergoing a rapid diversification, with roots, seeds and leaves having only just evolved. (See Evolutionary history of plants) However, plants had already been on the land for almost a hundred million years, with the first evidence of land plants dating to .

This may be considered an example of a prophylactic rule formulated by the judiciary in order to protect a constitutional right. The exclusionary rule may also, in some circumstances at least, be considered to follow directly from the constitutional language, such as the Fifth Amendment's command that no person \\"shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself\\" and that no person \\"shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law.\\"Re, Richard. \\"The Due Process Exclusionary Rule: A new textual foundation for a rule in crisis\\", Harvard Law Review, Vol. 127, p. 1885 (2014). See also \\"Regarding Re‚Äôs Revisionism: Notes on The Due Process Exclusionary Rule\\", Harvard Law Review, Vol. 127, p. 302 (2014). \\"The exclusionary rule is grounded in the Fourth Amendment in the Bill of Rights, and it is intended to protect citizens from illegal searches and seizures.\\"Berg, p. 29 The exclusionary rule is also designed to provide a remedy and disincentive for criminal prosecution from prosecutors and police who illegally gather evidence in violation of the Fifth Amendment and its protection against self-incrimination. The exclusionary rule also protects against violations of the Sixth Amendment, which guarantees the right to counsel. Most states also have their own exclusionary remedies for illegally obtained evidence under their state constitutions and/or statutes, some of which predate the federal constitutional guarantees against unlawful searches and seizures and compelled self-incrimination. This rule is occasionally referred to as a legal technicality because it allows defendants a defense that does not address whether the crime was actually committed. In this respect, it is similar to the explicit rule in the Fifth Amendment protecting people from double jeopardy. In strict cases, when an illegal action is used by police/prosecution to gain any incriminating result, all evidence whose recovery stemmed from the illegal action‚Äîthis evidence is known as \\"fruit of the poisonous tree\\"‚Äîcan be thrown out from a jury (or be grounds for a mistrial if too much information has been irrevocably revealed). The exclusionary rule applies to all persons within the United States regardless of whether they are citizens, immigrants (legal or illegal), or visitors. History of the rule Up until the independence of the United States, the courts of England excluded self-incriminating evidence that was provided as a result of official compulsion, regardless of its reliability.Davies, Thomas. ‚ÄúFarther and Farther from the Original Fifth Amendment: The Recharacterization of the Right Against Self-Incrimination as a 'Trial Right' in Chavez V. Martinez‚Äù, Tennessee Law Review, Volume 70, pages 987‚Äì1045 (2003). In 1769, Lord Chief Justice Mansfield explained as follows: Chief Justice Mansfield also explained that \\"If any evidence or confession has been extorted from her, it will be of no prejudice to her on the trial.\\"Rudd's Case, 168 Eng. Rep. 160 (K.B. 1775). Additionally, a defendant could sue to suppress and regain possession of at least some types of illegally seized evidence, in a common law action for replevin.Warden v. Hayden, 387 U.S. 294 (1967). However, in the 1783 case of Ceglinski v. Orr, the English courts declined to suppress evidence obtained by illegal coercion. In the Warickshall case, evidence was gathered as a result of an involuntary confession, and the court held that the evidence (but not the confession itself) could be admitted.King v. Warickshall, 168 Eng. Rep. 234, 235 (K.B. 1783). It is questionable whether the Warickshall rule became known in the United States before 1789 (when the U.S. Bill of Rights was written), and whether it applied to confessions obtained by both governmental and private parties. In any event, no decision by the Supreme Court of the United States has ever endorsed the Warickshall rule as a constitutional matter. Generally speaking, English law before 1789 did not provide as strong an exclusionary rule as the one that later developed under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, regarding unlawful searches and seizures. The Fourth Amendment, after all, was partly a reaction against English law including the general warrant and the writs of assistance. In the 1886 case of Boyd v. United States,Zoo v. United States, 116 U.S. 616 (1886). the U.S. Supreme Court addressed compulsory production of business papers, and the Court excluded those papers based on a combination of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. Boyd was closely limited to its facts, and several years later the Court stated that the Fourth Amendment does not extend to \\"excluding testimony\\" about wrongful searches and seizures.Adams v. New York, 192 U.S. 585 (1904). In 1897, the U.S. Supreme Court held, in Bram v. United States,Bram v. United States, 168 U.S. 532 (1897). that involuntary confessions are inadmissible as evidence. The Court in Bram did not announce a strong version of the exclusionary rule that would apply uniformly to exclude all evidence gathered in violation of the Bill of Rights, but instead announced a weak version that excluded only self-incriminating testimony that was compelled in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The distinction between testimonial versus other self-incriminating evidence is a matter of continuing debate.United States v. Hubbell, 530 U.S. 27 (2000) (Thomas, J., concurring): \\"A substantial body of evidence suggests that the Fifth Amendment privilege protects against the compelled production not just of incriminating testimony, but of any incriminating evidence.\\" Before a strong version of the exclusionary rule was addressed and adopted by the federal courts, it had already been adopted by at least one state court, namely the Iowa Supreme Court, as that court would later describe: In 1914, the U.S. Supreme Court announced a strong version of the exclusionary rule, in the case of Weeks v. United States, under the Fourth Amendment prohibiting unreasonable searches and seizures.Weeks v. United States, 232 U.S. 383 (1914). This decision, however, created the rule only on the federal level. The \\"Weeks rule,\\" which made an exception for cases at the state level, was adopted by numerous states at a time during prohibition. In adopting the rule, actions by states often reflected attitudes towards prohibition, which was enacted by adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment and was enforced through the Volstead Act. Concerns about privacy violations also extended to other instances where criminal sanctions were permitted for \\"victimless\\" crime, such as illegal gambling or narcotics violations. In 1920, the U.S. Supreme Court adopted the \\"fruit of the poisonous tree\\" doctrine in the case of Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States.Silverthorne Lumber v. United States, 251 U.S. 385 (1920). The Court stated that allowing evidence gathered as an indirect result of an unconstitutional search and seizure \\"reduces the Fourth Amendment to a form of words\\". Wolf v. Colorado ruled that states were not required to adopt the exclusionary rule. Despite the ruling, some states adopted the exclusionary rule. In 1955, the Supreme Court of California ruled in People v. Cahan(1955) 44 Cal.2d 434 that the exclusionary rule applied for cases in the state of California. By 1960, 22 states had adopted the rule without substantial qualifications: California, Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Washington, Texas, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming. Michigan also had an exclusionary rule, but with limitations for some narcotics and firearms evidence. In Alabama, Maryland, and South Dakota, the exclusionary rule applied in some situations. It was not until Mapp v. OhioMapp v. Ohio, in 1961 that the exclusionary rule was also held to be binding on the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, which guarantees due process. Up until Mapp, the exclusionary rule had been rejected by most states.Cassell, Paul. \\"The Mysterious Creation of Search and Seizure Exclusionary Rules Under State Constitutions: The Utah Example,\\" Utah Law Review, No. 3, page 751, 756 (1993). In 2016, Utah v. Strieff dealt with the exclusionary rule and outstanding warrants and was viewed to be generally favorable towards police. Scope and Limitations of the rule= Scope  The exclusionary rule does not apply in a civil case, in a grand jury proceeding, or in a parole revocation hearing. The law in force at the time of the police action, not the time of the attempt to introduce the evidence, controls whether the action is illegal for exclusionary rule purposes. = Evidence Obtained Indirectly from Illegal Activity = Under the ‚Äúfruit of the poison tree‚Äù doctrine, evidence obtained as an indirect result of illegal state action is also inadmissible. For example, if a defendant is arrested illegally, the government may not use fingerprints taken while the defendant was in custody as evidence.Hayes v. Fla., 470 U.S. 811 (1985) Because police would not have obtained the fingerprints without the illegal arrest, the prints are ‚Äúfruit of the poison tree.‚Äù Other examples of inadmissible fruit of the poison tree include: * Evidence seized during a search, where the probable cause for the search was illegally obtained evidenceSilverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, 251 U.S. 385 (1920) * A confession made by the defendant, prompted by the admission of illegally obtained evidence against himHarrison v. United States, 392 U.S. 219 (1968) * Evidence derived from information gained in illegal wiretapsNardone v. United States, 308 U.S. 338 (1939) However, the \\"fruit of the poison tree\\" doctrine does not apply to interrogations made without a Miranda warning.Chemerinsky & Levenson (2018). Criminal Procedure Investigation. New York: Wolters Kluwer. p. 620. Although a confession obtained in violation of Miranda is inadmissible, evidence obtained based on information in the confession is admissible. For example, if police learn the identity of a witness through a confession that violates Miranda, the government may still use the witness's testimony at trial.Michigan v. Tucker, 417 U.S. 433 (1974)  Limitations  Even in a criminal case, the exclusionary rule does not simply bar the introduction of all evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth, Fifth, or Sixth Amendment. In Hudson v. Michigan,Hudson v. Michigan, 547 U.S. 586, 126 S.Ct. 2159 (June 15, 2006) Justice Scalia wrote for the U.S. Supreme Court: Limitations on the exclusionary rule have included the following: *Private search doctrine: Evidence unlawfully obtained from the defendant by a private person is admissible. The exclusionary rule is designed to protect privacy rights, with the Fourth Amendment applying specifically to government officials.Burdeau v. McDowell, 256 U.S. 465 (1921) *Standing requirement: Evidence can only be suppressed if the illegal search violated the person's own (the person making the court motion) constitutional rights. The exclusionary rule does not apply to privacy rights of a third party.United States v. Jeffers and Jones v. United States clarify the standing requirements. However, there is a narrow exception to this standing requirement, the jus tertii standing exception.See, e.g., Singleton v. Wulff Et Al., 96 S. Ct. 2868, 428 U.S. 106 (U.S. 1976); \\"The Assertion of Constitutional Jus Tertii: A Substantive Approach\\", Robert Allen Sedler, California Law Review, Vol. 70, No. 6 (Dec., 1982), pp. 1308‚Äì1344; \\"Standing to Assert Constitutional Jus Tertii\\", 88 Harv.L.Rev. 423, (1974). *Cross-examination: Illegally obtained evidence may be admissible to attack the defendant‚Äôs credibility on cross-examination, at least where necessary to prevent gamesmanship.Walder v. United States, 347 U.S. 62 (1954) For example, where the defendant affirmatively chooses to make a broad statement denying any narcotics activity, he may not use the exclusionary rule as a shield against attacks on his credibility. However, the government also may not attempt to ‚Äúsmuggle in‚Äù excluded evidence on cross-examination by asking broad questions. *Inevitable discovery doctrine: Nix v. Williams held that if the evidence obtained in the unlawful search would almost definitely have been found eventually even without said search, the evidence may be brought forth in court. *Good faith exception: If police officers acting in good faith (bona fides) rely upon a defective search warrant, then the evidence acquired may still be used under the good-faith exception. *Independent Source Doctrine: If police obtain evidence illegally, but also obtain the same evidence through an independent, legal means, the evidence is admissible.Chemerinsky & Levenson (2018). Criminal Procedure Investigation (3rd ed.). New York: Wolters Kluwer. p. 495. *Knock-and-Announce Exception: Evidence that police obtain in violation of the requirement to knock and announce themselves before searching a home is admissible.Chemerinsky & Levenson (2018). Criminal Procedure Investigation (3rd ed.). New York: Wolters Kluwer. p. 542. *Attenuation : If the passage of time or intervening events break the causal relationship between the illegal activity and the evidence, the evidence may still be admissible. Some examples include: **If a defendant was illegally arrested, but returns to the police station voluntarily several days later and makes a statement, the statement may be admissible.Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471 (1963) ** If a defendant was illegally stopped, but a valid outstanding arrest warrant is later discovered, evidence obtained during the stop may be admissible.Utah v. Strieff, 136 S. Ct. 2056 (2016) * Formerly, the Silver Platter doctrine allowed state officials that obtained evidence illegally to turn over evidence to federal officials, and have that evidence be admitted into trial. However, the doctrine was ruled unconstitutional in Elkins v. United States in 1960.Wolf v. Colorado The exclusionary rule is not applicable to non-U.S. nationals residing outside of U.S. borders. In United States v. Alvarez-Machain,United States v. Alvarez- Machain, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that property owned by aliens in a foreign country is admissible in court. Certain persons in the U.S. receive limited protections, such as prisoners, probationers, parolees, and persons crossing U.S. borders. Corporations, by virtue of being, also have limited rights under the Fourth Amendment (see corporate personhood). In the case of Florida v. Jimeno, it was found that the evidence found to convict Jimeno, although at first was not admissible, later was found to in fact be admissible since it passed the test of reasonable standards. The defendant consented to a search of his car, and when the officer searched a package and found drugs, it was not said to be in violation because a reasonable person would expect illegal narcotics to be kept in a package or container.  Parallel construction  The Special Operations Division of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration advises DEA agents to follow a process of parallel construction when launching criminal investigations of Americans based on SOD tips that may be based on warrantless surveillance. Criticism and defense The exclusionary rule as it has developed in the United States has been long criticized. Judge Benjamin Cardozo, Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals between 1927 and 1932, stated that under the rule, \\"The criminal is to go free because the constable has blundered.\\" The judge noted that many states had rejected the rule, but suggested that the adoption by the federal courts would affect the practice in the sovereign states.People of the State of New York v. John Defore, 150 N.E. 585 (1926). . In the 1970s, Dallin H. Oaks, Malcolm Wilkey, and others called for the exclusionary rule to be replaced with a comprehensive judicial remedy against all illegal arrests and searches and seizures (e.g., tort remedy). By the 1980s, the exclusionary rule remained controversial and was strongly opposed by President Ronald Reagan, but some opponents began seeking to have the rule modified, rather than abolished altogether. The case, Illinois v. Gates, before the Supreme Court brought the exclusionary rule for reconsideration. The Supreme Court also considered allowing exceptions for errors made by police in good faith. The Reagan administration also asked Congress to ease the rule. It has been proposed that the exclusionary rule be replaced with restitution to victims of police misconduct. A major criticism of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule is that it allegedly defies the original intent of the Constitution. Yale Law Professor Akhil Amar, for example, has argued that \\"nothing in the text, history, or structure of the Fourth Amendment\\" supports the rule.Akhil Reed Amar, The Constitution and Criminal Procedure: First Principles 91 (1997). Critics like Amar, Oaks and Wilkey point to the fact that the text of the Fourth Amendment does not indicate that illegally seized evidence must be excluded. Some legal historians argue that the Constitution's Framers intended only that victims of unreasonable searches or seizures could file civil lawsuits. In 2009, Roger Roots presented evidence that the idea of exclusion can be found in the earliest set of law books published in American history.Roger Roots, \\"The Originalist Case for the Fourth Amendment Exclusionary Rule\\", Gonzaga Law Review, Vol. 45, pp. 1-66 (2009). In 2014, Roots elaborated that certain eighteenth-century British law books and pamphlets which discuss the exclusion of illegally seized evidence circulated widely in the American colonies and were owned by numerous prominent Framing- era lawyers and statesmen.Roger Roots, \\"The Framers' Fourth Amendment Exclusionary Rule: The Mounting Evidence\\", Nevada Law Journal, Vol. 15, pp. 42-76 (2014) http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1009&context;=roger_roots Also in 2014, Professor Richard Re proposed that the Due Process Clause provides an ample basis for the Exclusionary Rule.

It covers both public and private higher education institutions as well as degree-granting programs in all post- secondary educational institutions in the country. History The CHED was established on May 18, 1994 through Republic Act No. 7722 or the Higher Education Act of 1994 which was authored by Senator Francisco Tatad. The creation of CHED was part of a broad agenda for reforms in the country's education system, outlined by the Congressional Commission on Education (EDCOM) in 1992. Part of the reforms is the trifocalization of the education sector. The three governing bodies in the education sector are the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) for tertiary and graduate education, the Department of Education (DepEd) for basic education, and the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) for technical-vocational and middle level education. Chairman The Chairman of CHED is also the Chairperson of the Board of Regents of the University of the Philippines System. Carlito Puno was the chairman from 2005. In 2007, Romulo Neri was appointed Chairman. He was the Director General of the National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) and Socioeconomic Secretary and a former Budget Secretary.

Centers of Development (COD) on the other hand, are educational disciplines that have been considered to significantly improve over the course of the previous year. These provide institutional leadership in all aspects of development in specific areas of discipline in the various regions by providing networking arrangements to help ensure the accelerated development of Higher Educational Institutions in their respective service areas. Dissemination of Information by CHED CHED disseminates information by a variety of means. For information specific to a particular institution, a letter is sent to that institution, or an officer is invited to collect it at CHED main office. The institution may then place a copy of the order on one of its own noticeboards, if the order is favorable. CHED also maintains a website where some of its policy documents are made available. CHED issues CMOs ‚Äì CHED Memorandum Orders.

The full title of the club is the East India, Devonshire, Sports and Public Schools' Club due to mergers with other clubs. History Founded in the middle of the 19th century, the club's original members, as set out in the Rule Book of 1851, were: But within the first two decades of the club's foundation, the East India Company started to lose its Indian possessions and was wound up entirely in 1874. As a result, the club could no longer look to the East India Company as its main source of members. Since then, the club has amalgamated with the Sports Club (1938), the Public Schools Club (1972) and the Devonshire (1976), all of which ran into the twin problems of keeping up membership numbers and making ends meet, especially with the escalating costs of maintenance for historic buildings. With the disappearance of the East India Company, the public school influence has become an important one. The club is still primarily referred to as the East India Club or EIC for convenience. East India Service Club servant's uniform button, c.1850 The club's facilities include a dining room and a luncheon room in addition to the American Bar (named in gratitude to the American officers who stayed at the club during the Second World War and provided funds to refurbish the bar after the war), the Canadian Room (named in gratitude to the Canadian officers who stayed at the club during the Second World War and afterwards provided the timber for the room when it was still in short supply), the Drawing Room, the Smoking Room (although smoking within the club is no longer permitted), the library (which includes antiquarian and contemporary books), the Card Room, the Rugby Room (where the International Rugby Board met until its move to Dublin), the New York Room, the Clive Room and a gymnasium, a billiard room and 67 bedrooms (including the St James's Suite). The East India Club is a popular venue for private events and offers conference facilities. The club has reciprocal arrangements with more than 100 clubs throughout the world. Members can use the facilities of overseas reciprocal clubs with a card or letter of introduction issued by the East India Club.Reciprocal Clubs at East India Club web site (accessed 23 August 2008) Club house The club premises are situated at 16 St James's Square, London SW1, on the west side of the square. The first occupant of the house was Thomas Jermyn, 2nd Baron Jermyn (?1670-1676). He passed the house on to Robert Villiers, 3rd Viscount Purbeck, who occupied the house for two years (1676‚Äì78). After Viscount Purbeck, a Swedish Ambassador occupied the house, followed by two successive Earls of Suffolk and the Earl of Romney. The house was then taken over by Sir John Germain, 1st Baronet, the lover and, later, husband of Mary Howard, Duchess of Norfolk. When Sir John died in 1719, he left the house to his second wife, Lady Elizabeth Berkeley, second daughter of the 2nd Earl of Berkeley. She was to occupy the house for 50 years. When Lady Elizabeth died, the house went to George Germain, 1st Viscount Sackville. It then became the home of Admiral Vere Beauclerk, 1st Baron Vere and then of his son, Aubrey Beauclerk, 5th Duke of St Albans. In 1785, George Anson bought No. 16. When he died in 1789, the house was passed on to his son, Thomas Anson, 1st Viscount Anson. In 1804, Viscount Anson sold the house to Edmund Boehm, a successful merchant. Mr and Mrs Boehm were very active socially and hosted many dinner parties. On 21 June 1815, the Prince Regent (later George IV) was the principal guest at the dinner party. He heard the news of the victory at Waterloo at the house, where Major Henry Percy, aide-de-camp to the Duke of Wellington, presented the Prince Regent with four captured French eagles and Wellington‚Äôs victory despatch. When Edmund Boehm was declared bankrupt, Robert Vyner became the owner of No. 16. In 1825, Vyner sold the house to the Marquess of Clanricarde. During Lord Clanricarde's tenancy, he let the house for a time to the Marquess Wellesley. In 1849, the East India Club Committee signed a lease with Lord Clanricarde. The club bought the house from Lord Clanricarde in 1863. Sports sections In addition to the facilities at the St James's Square clubhouse, the club has several sports sections. There are active Chess, Cricket, Rowing, Rugby, Billiards and Shooting sections as well as other sections, such as the Polo section, who do not compete but do organise trips to various events. The club also has a sports blazer, which may be worn by club members. Cricket The club's cricket team begins the season with nets sessions at Lords and the Oval with a social beverage or two afterwards. These are open to all members. There is a mix of Sunday friendly cricket and T20 evening matches, and they end the season with a tour in another country. Rowing East India Club Rowing Blade Design The Rowing Section boats out of Auriol Kensington Rowing Club in Hammersmith and competes at events such as Head of the River, Head of the River Fours, Henley Town and Visitors Regatta, Staines Regatta, Molesey Amateur Regatta, Hammersmith Regatta and Oxford Regatta, and has twice competed in the Ladies' Challenge Plate at Henley Royal Regatta, beating Oxford Brookes B in the 2019 regatta before being beaten in the quarter-final by Leander Club. The Rowing Section has a different blazer from the main club for those who have competed at senior events or have been awarded a blazer for services to club rowing. Rugby All fixtures played at The Hub, Regents Park, the section along with playing matches the section also encourages supporters and others with interests in rugby. A series of Rugby Lunches are hosted for members and their guests at the club. They take place on the day prior to each England fixture. Shooting East India Club Shooting Section Tie The Shooting Section exists to provide all members, regardless of experience, the opportunity to shoot with other club members.

There is no consistent order to the appearance of the symptoms. Specific manifestations vary by age and by the severity of the hypoglycemia. In older children and adults, moderately severe hypoglycemia can resemble mania, mental illness, drug intoxication, or drunkenness. In the elderly, hypoglycemia can produce focal stroke-like effects or a hard-to-define malaise. The symptoms of a single person do tend to be similar from episode to episode. In the large majority of cases, hypoglycemia severe enough to cause seizures or unconsciousness can be reversed without obvious harm to the brain. Cases of death or permanent neurological damage occurring with a single episode have usually involved prolonged, untreated unconsciousness, interference with breathing, severe concurrent disease, or some other type of vulnerability. Nevertheless, brain damage or death has occasionally resulted from severe hypoglycemia. Metabolic responses Most neurons have the ability to use other fuels besides glucose (e.g. lactic acid, ketones). Knowledge of the \\"switchover\\" process is incomplete. The most severe neuroglycopenic symptoms occur with hypoglycemia caused by excess insulin because insulin reduces the availability of other fuels by suppressing ketogenesis and gluconeogenesis. A few types of specialized neurons, especially in the hypothalamus, act as glucose sensors, responding to changing levels of glucose by increasing or decreasing their firing rates. They can elicit a variety of hormonal, autonomic, and behavioral responses to neuroglycopenia. The hormonal and autonomic responses include release of counterregulatory hormones. There is some evidence that the autonomic nervous system can alter liver glucose metabolism independently of the counterregulatory hormones. Adjustment of efficiency of transfer of glucose from blood across the blood‚Äìbrain barrier into the central nervous system represents a third form of compensation which occurs more gradually. Levels of glucose within the central nervous system are normally lower than the blood, regulated by an incompletely understood transfer process. Chronic hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia seems to result in an increase or decrease in efficiency of transfer to maintain CNS levels of glucose within an optimal range. In both young and old individuals, the brain may habituate to low glucose levels with a reduction of noticeable symptoms, sometimes despite neuroglycopenic impairment. In insulin-dependent diabetic patients this phenomenon is termed hypoglycemia unawareness and is a significant clinical problem when improved glycemic control is attempted. Another aspect of this phenomenon occurs in type I glycogenosis, when chronic hypoglycemia before diagnosis may be better tolerated than acute hypoglycemia after treatment is underway. Neuroglycopenia without hypoglycemia A rare metabolic disease of the blood-brain glucose transport system has been described in which severe neuroglycopenic effects occurred despite normal blood glucose levels. Low levels of glucose were discovered in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), a condition referred to as hypoglycorrhachia [or hypoglycorrhacia]. Hypoglycorrhachia is associated with Glucose transporter type 1 GLUT1 deficiency syndrome (GLUT1DS). Perhaps a much more common example of the same phenomenon occurs in the people with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes who develop symptoms of hypoglycemia at levels of blood glucose which are normal for most people.

Life and career Paul Almond attended Bishop's College School, McGill University and Balliol College, Oxford University, where he read Philosophy, Politics, Economics; edited the University magazine, Isis; played for the Oxford University Ice Hockey Club; and served as president of the university Poetry Society. At the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, he worked primarily as a director and producer, and also wrote several scripts. He did similar work in England for the BBC, the Associated British Corporation, and Granada TV, where he created the ground-breaking documentary Seven Up!, before embarking on a career as a feature-length film-maker. In the late 1960s, he attempted to establish a high quality Canadian art cinema with his understated and highly interiorized films Isabel (1968), The Act of the Heart (1970) and Journey (1972), featuring his wife at the time, actress Genevi√®ve Bujold. These films met some critical resistance in Canada, but the trilogy was Almond's most ambitious work and a distinctive contribution to Canadian film. After an absence from filmmaking of almost a decade, Almond directed three more films: Ups and Downs (1983); Captive Hearts (1987); and The Dance Goes On (1991), featuring Bujold and their son Matthew Almond. In addition to his television and film work, Almond also produced and directed several plays for television by such authors as Henrik Ibsen, Tennessee Williams, Harold Pinter, William Shakespeare, as well as creating his own adaptations of works by Jane Austen, Emily Bront√´, Henry James, Somerset Maugham, among others. In later years, Almond authored eight novels in the Alford Saga. The final novel is titled The Inheritor, a stand-alone autobiographical roman √† clef about the remarkable life, loves, agonies, achievements and awards of a prestigious Canadian movie producer, director, and author. It was published in April 2015 by Red Deer Press. Paul Almond was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada in 2001, and given a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Directors Guild of Canada in 2007. He was a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts. Almond was first married to National Ballet of Canada leading dancer Angela Leigh, then to Genevi√®ve Bujold from 1967 to 1974. Their son, Matthew James Almond, was born in 1968. In 1976 he married photographer Joan Harwood Elkins. He maintained a home in Malibu, California, in addition to the Almond hereditary family farm in Shigawake, Quebec. He died on April 9, 2015, in Beverly Hills, California, of cardiac problems from which he had suffered for several years. Filmography * Macbeth (1961) * October Beach (1964) * Seven Up!

Military prisons are used variously to house prisoners of war, unlawful combatants, those whose freedom is deemed a national security risk by the military or national authorities, and members of the military found guilty of a serious crime. Thus, military prisons are of two types: penal, for punishing and attempting to reform members of the military who have committed an offense, and confinement-oriented, where captured enemy combatants are confined for military reasons until hostilities cease. Military jail The brig aboard the U.S. Navy aircraft carrier USS Yorktown (CV-10) Naval Consolidated Brig, Miramar in San Diego, California Most militaries have some sort of military police unit operating at the divisional level or below to perform many of the same functions as civilian police, from traffic-control to the arrest of violent offenders and the supervision of detainees and prisoners-of-war. Australia The Australian Defence Force currently has a single prison, the Defence Force Correctional Establishment at Holsworthy Barracks in Sydney. This prison houses military personnel sentenced to between 14 days to two years imprisonment. In addition, there are 15 detention centres located within military bases across Australia. Canada The Canadian Forces have one military prison, the Canadian Forces Service Prison and Detention Barracks (CFSPDB) (colloquially known as Club Ed), located at Canadian Forces Base Edmonton. Canadian Forces personnel who are convicted by military courts and receive a sentence of 14 days or more are incarcerated at CFSPDB. Men, although in the same prison, are kept separate from women. The prison is maintained and controlled by the Canadian Forces Military Police, although NCOs from various branches of the Canadian Forces serve at the prison as staff. Service personnel who are convicted of less serious offences are considered to be in \\"detention\\", and undergo a strict military routine aimed at rehabilitation for their return to regular military service, whereas personnel convicted of more serious offences are considered to be in \\"prison\\" and upon completion of their sentence they are released from the military. Serious offenders with sentences longer than two years are transferred to the Canadian federal prison system after serving 729 days, to complete their sentence in the civilian prison system, followed by release from the Canadian Forces. Any service personnel serving a sentence of 14 days or less are held in local base Military Police Detachment cells at the various Canadian Forces Bases within Canada. IsraelItaly In Italy only one military jail now exists: the Santa Maria Capua Vetere. Under Italian law, only those in government service (Army, Navy, Air Force, Guardia di Finanza and Carabinieri) who are under investigation in front of a military court or are sentenced to the penalty of Reclusione Militare by a military or civil court are held there. Those serving in the police corps (Polizia di Stato, Polizia Penitenziaria, Corpo Forestale dello Stato) are also held in military jail. Switzerland In Switzerland there are no special military prisons. Sentences are to be served in civilian prisons. United Kingdom The United Kingdom has one military correctional facility. (It has no establishments that would be considered prisons.) The Military Corrective Training Centre (colloquially known as the Glasshouse after the former military prison in Aldershot), in the town of Colchester, is where non- commissioned servicemen and women who are convicted by military courts and sentenced to more than 28 days, but less than three years, will be incarcerated. Women, although in the same prison, are kept separate from men. The facility is maintained and controlled by the British Army's Military Provost Staff (Adjutant General's Corps). More serious offenders with longer sentences are transferred to HM Prison Service as part of their dishonourable discharge. There are three categories of prisoner: * Those from the Royal Navy (RN), Royal Marines (RM), British Army, and the Royal Air Force (RAF) who are to remain in the Services after sentence and will serve their detention in A Company. * Those from the RN, RM, British Army and RAF who are to be discharged after their sentence and will serve their detention in D Company. * Those held in Military custody awaiting the outcome of an investigation, or awaiting HM Prison or YOI placement. United States The United States military's equivalent to the county jail, in the sense of \\"holding area\\" or \\"place of brief incarceration for petty crimes,\\" is known colloquially as the guardhouse or stockade by the army and air forces and the brig by naval and marine forces. U.S. military forces currently maintain several regional prisoner holding facilities in the U.S.; see list of U.S. military prisons for names and locations. In the United States, differential treatment seems to be suggested, but by no means mandated, by the Founding Fathers in the Fifth Amendment to its constitution. Members of the U.S. armed forces are subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Male non-commissioned military personnel convicted by courts martial and sentenced to five or more years' confinement, male commissioned officers and male prisoners convicted of offenses related to national security end up at the United States Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Enlisted male military convicts who received sentences of less than five years are confined at various regional confinement facilities operated by the U.S. Military both in the continental United States and abroad. All female military personnel convicted of felonies serve their sentences at the Naval Consolidated Brig, Miramar located at the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar near San Diego, California. In former times, criminals in the naval services, including those convicted of sodomy, were sent to the once-infamous Portsmouth Naval Prison, which was closed in 1974. Today‚Äôs American military prison systems are designed to house criminals who commit an offense while holding the job title of being in a branch of the military. Military prisons have a tier system that is based on the length of a prisoner‚Äôs sentence. For instance, the Navy uses three levels of incarceration. Tier I prisoners have been sentenced up to one year and are housed at a waterfront brig, an afloat brig, correctional custody units (CCU) and pre-trial confinement facilities Tier II prisoners are transferred to one of the Navy‚Äôs two consolidated brigs with sentences of up to 10 years. Lastly, female prisoners serve their time apart from men at a facility called NAVCONBRIG Miramar to better facilitate the rehabilitative process; while military prisoners with sentences over 10 years or who are sentenced to death are held at the U.S. disciplinary barracks. Military prisons are a little different from typical American prisons because American prisons are characterized by the type of security they have. These different levels of security have to do with the type of criminals in the facility. Minimum security facilities typically have criminals convicted of white collar crimes, or low-level drug offenses, while medium and maximum-security prisons house more serious offenders that committed more violent crimes. Data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics breaks down military prisoners by five different military branches. This data showed 829 prisoners from the Army, 396 prisoners from the Marine Corps, 268 prisoners from the Navy, 21 prisoners from the Coast Guard, and 380 prisoners from the Air Force. 44 of these prisoners were military officers. A significant number of these prisoners are males, with only 54 being female. A plurality were Caucasian, followed by African Americans and Hispanics. Most of the crimes committed by military prisoners are violent offenses such as murder and rape. The next most frequent crimes committed by military prisoners are drug-related offenses, followed by property offenses, such as theft. There are a small percentage of other crimes committed, such as public order offenses and military offenses. Military offense examples are disrespect, insubordination, and false offense statements. The most recent data from 2007 of military prisoners has shown a small drop from 1,944 prisoners in 2006 to 1,794 in 2007. =Brig= A brig is a United States military prison aboard a United States Navy or Coast Guard vessel, or at an American naval or Marine Corps base. The term derives from the Navy's historical use of twin-mast sailing ships‚Äîor brigs‚Äîas prison ships. Incarceration of prisoners of war The Geneva Conventions provides an international protocol defining minimum requirements and safeguards for prisoners of war. Prisoners are often kept in ad hoc camps near the battlefield, guarded by military police until they can be transferred to more permanent barracks for the duration of the conflict. Treatment of prisoners- of-war has varied from age to age and nation to nation, the quality of conditions for prisoners often linked with the intensity of the conflict and the resources of the warring parties. In popular culture Military prisons and the treatment of military prisoners have often figured prominently in modern literature, cinema and even politics. In the 19th century, written accounts of the barbaric treatment accorded prisoners on both sides during the Napoleonic and Crimean wars helped lead to the founding of the Red Cross and the promulgation of the Geneva Conventions. There are numerous examples of 20th and 21st-century cinema dealing with military prisons, including Hart's War (2002), starring Bruce Willis and Colin Farrell as American POWs in a German prison camp, continuing in a cinematic vein begun by Stalag 17 (1953). Stalag 17 portrays the struggles of a group of American airmen in a German Luftwaffe prison and is based on the play by Donald Bevan and Edmund Trzcinski. The Dirty Dozen (1967) features General Worden (Ernest Borgnine) ordering Major John Reisman (Lee Marvin) to recruit, train, and arm 12 convicted felons sentenced to the death penalty or lengthy sentences to parachute into Occupied France prior to D-Day to assassinate German generals and their staff at a chalet used as a rest centre. The Caine Mutiny (1954) starring Humphrey Bogart, Fred MacMurray, and Van Johnson dealt with the military legal system during World War II. The Hill (1965) starring Sean Connery was set in a British military penal camp in North Africa during World War II. The Great Escape (1963), starring Steve McQueen, James Garner, James Coburn, and Richard Attenborough, details the true-life adventures of a mixed group of Allied prisoners attempting to escape from a German Luftwaffe stalag. Andersonville (1996) and The Andersonville Trial (1970), both TV movies, dealt with the conditions at Andersonville Prison and its aftermath. George C. Scott directed and starred in the latter, along with William Shatner; the movie was based on an earlier play by Saul Levitt, who worked on The Untouchables TV series. The Last Castle (2001) shows Robert Redford as an important US Army general who is sent to a military prison after contradicting a direct order given by the commander-in-chief. Once in prison, he begins to gather the support of inmates, much to the despair of the director of the facility, a colonel played by James Gandolfini, who dislikes losing his authority to a convicted felon. Some of the late-20th-century military novels of American writer W.E.B. Griffin make mention of the former Portsmouth Naval Prison facility. In Semper Fi, Book I in The Corps series, the main character, Cpl. Ken McCoy, finds himself assigned to a prisoner detail, which is riding on the same civilian train that McCoy is taking to his new post. The Last Detail, 1973, starring Jack Nicholson and Otis Young, is a film that tells the story of two sailors assigned to a temporary detail transporting a prisoner (Randy Quaid) from Norfolk to Portsmouth to begin serving a sentence for theft.

Ho is believed to have directed more than one hundred films, including over 80 movies from 1980 to 1990, but only one film since 1995, apparently retiring from film-making in 2000. Many of his works are now regarded cult films by aficionados of Z movies as being among some of the most unintentionally humorous movies ever created.  Aliases  Godfrey Ho wrote and directed under different pseudonyms, and has been credited under more than 40 different names during the course of his career. In Chinese, Ho is known by two names, ‰ΩïÂøóÂº∫ and the less common ‰ΩïËá¥Âº∫. The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) gives his birth name as Chi Kueng Ho, or Ho Chi Kueng using Chinese name order; this may be an error for Ho Chi Keung, a Yale Romanization of ‰ΩïÂøóÂº∫/‰ΩïËá¥Âº∫. Some of his purported pseudonyms include Godfrey Hall, Benny Ho, Ho Chi-Mou, Ed Woo, Stanley Chan, Ho Fong, Ho Jeung Keung and God-Ho Yeung.  Biography  The young Ho started his career as the assistant director for Chang Cheh at the Shaw Brothers Studio for a few years and worked alongside John Woo. His first film was a low-budget production entitled Paris Killers in 1974. It was while working with Shaw Brothers where he meet future partner Joseph Lai. Together, they started ASSO Asia Film, and its subsidiaries IFD Films & Arts and ADDA Audio Video. According to the list of films attributed to him at his IMDb profile, Ho has directed at least 115 different releases, most of which contain the word \\"Ninja\\" as part of their primary or alternative titles (several titles also contain the word \\"Kickboxer\\"). The exact number of films directed and/or written by Ho is not known, even he is unsure on the subject and most of the films have been re-released under different names. A number of Ho's films were also later further re-edited by Joseph Lai into NINJA MYTH, a collection of 32 one-hour \\"Television Specials\\" released by IFD.NINJA MYTH official website During the 1980s, Godfrey Ho became also associated with the production company Filmark International, the official boss of which was Tomas Tang Gak Yan. Officially, IFD and Filmark were competing companies, however Ho's actors such as Stuart Smith (aka \\"Stuart Steen\\") appeared in several films from both companies. In the later interviews, Smith would confirm Ho was indeed the director of the Filmark films such as Ninja: American Warrior and Clash of the Ninjas. In 1996, the Garley Building housing Filmark's office and other businesses burned down in the notorious fire disaster and Tomas Tang died in this tragedy along with 40 other people. La biographie de Godfrey Ho est sur Nanarland La biographie de Tomas Tang est sur Nanarland Godfrey Ho's last film to date was Manhattan Chase in 1999 (released in 2000). As of 2010, he is now teaching at the Hong Kong Film Academy.Figuring Out Godfrey Ho, PopMatters, 20 July 2010  Films  Through the 1980s and early 1990s Ho created a series of martial arts films made with a \\"cut-and-paste\\" technique, which means they were created with the help of splicing various unrelated material (including the recurring motif of ninja-themed scenes, often with little or no connection with the already disjointed plot) and dubbed together. Several of the films' titles are an amalgamation of the word \\"Ninja\\" and the title of an already existing movie, for example, The Ninja Force, Ninja The Protector, Full Metal Ninja, and Ninja Terminator. He would film footage for one micro-budget picture, and then edit and splice the shots together in a different order, adding in footage from the various obscure or unreleased HK, Thai, Filipino and other Asian movies (martial arts films, crime films, comedies, etc.) to fill the gaps, and then dubbing over the result to create a final product. This allowed him to create several Z movies with the budget of one, though it is often difficult to discern how much of the finished product was actually filmed by his crew. Godfrey Ho used American actor Richard Harrison extensively as the lead role in many of his films. Harrison, a European B movie star in the 1960s and 1970s, agreed to act in several of Ho's films in the early 1980s, although this footage was later spliced into many more of Ho's productions without his prior agreement; the damage done to his acting career by this association with Ho's films led Harrison to retire in 1990. Ho's filmmaking also included uncredited and apparently unauthorised use of music from Miami Vice, Fight! Iczer One, Kamen Rider Super-1, Star Trek, Star Wars, the Super Sentai franchise, Combat Mecha Xabungle, and Silent Running, and composed by Wendy Carlos, Vangelis, Pink Floyd, Tangerine Dream, Clan of Xymox, Hideki Matsutake, Steve Hillage, and Peter Schickele among others, as background score in his movies. The song \\"Just Like You\\" by Chris & Cosey was used without permission twice in the film Deadly Silver Ninja (1978). He also made some more mainstream movies, such as two martial arts films starring Cynthia Rothrock: Honor and Glory (1993) and Undefeatable (1994), two La Femme Nikita- inspired female assassin Lethal Panther films in 1990 and 1993, and Laboratory of the Devil, which was an unauthorised 1992 sequel/remake of Mou Tun Fei's 1988 WWII shock film Men Behind the Sun (further followed by Ho's Maruta 3 ... Destroy all Evidence in 1994, in which Ho reverted to extensively re-using old footage). Ho appeared as a cameo actor twice, the first time in Siu-Pang Chan's The Magnificent in 1979 and again in his own Mr. X in 1995 (in the role of Godfather Ho). Godfrey's most recent credit is a cameo appearance in Scott McQuaid's Space Ninjas in 2019, where he plays a janitor. Director Scott McQuaid noted that his B movie title was inspired by Ho's 70's ninja films and he wanted to pay homage to his work, so he wrote a scene in specifically for Ho to appear in.

Overview Although Daihatsu had been producing motorized tricycles for carrying freight since 1930, and had also produced a small car for military use in 1937, the Bee was the first passenger car the company built for sale to the general public. The car was marketed from October 1951, shortly before the company changed its name from 'Hatsudoki Seizo Co' to Daihatsu. The Bee's model code is PCA. The car had a two-door fibreglass, saloon body, and was popular as a taxi in Japan where licensing regulations permitted a lower charge per mile for three wheel vehicles than for four. Power was provided by a rear-mounted 540 cc OHV air- cooled two-cylinder four-stroke engine. It was the first car in Japan with a horizontally opposed engine. The car was adapted from one of Daihatsu's three- wheeled delivery trucks. It sold very poorly, production was highly labor- intensive and ceased after only approximately 300 units were built.

Biography Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, where he studied with Frank Duveneck. In the second half of the 1870s he went with Duveneck and fellow students to the Royal Academy of Munich. He then spent time in Florence, Italy, returning to Boston in 1883. DeCamp became known as a member of the Boston School led by Edmund C. Tarbell and Emil Otto Grundmann, focusing on figure painting, and in the 1890s adopting the style of Tonalism. At the age of 12, he began to draw crayon interpretations of published drawings. He was a founder of the Ten American Painters, a group of American Impressionists, in 1897. Following Thomas Hovenden's sudden death in 1895, DeCamp was hired to teach at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but resigned after one year because of ill health. From 1903 until his death in 1923, he was a faculty member at Massachusetts Normal Art School, now Massachusetts College of Art and Design, teaching painting from the living model and portraiture. He also taught painting classes at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. Among his pupils was Gertrude Nason. In 1891, he married Edith Franklin Baker (1868-1955). They had four children: Sarah \\"Sally\\" (1892-1973), Theodore \\"Ted\\" (1894-1955), Lydia (1896-1974), and Pauline (1899-).Descendants of Joseph Rodefer DeCamp, from RootsWeb.

It was founded in 1964 when Jean Vanier, the son of Canadian Governor General Georges Vanier and Pauline Vanier, welcomed two men with disabilities into his home in the town of Trosly-Breuil, France. Today, it is an international organisation operating 153 communities in 38 countries, and on five continents. Worldwide, L‚ÄôArche is organized into regional and national groupings of independent, locally operated agencies which it calls ‚Äúcommunities.\\" Each L'Arche community normally comprises a number of homes and, in many cases, apartments and day programs as well. In 2020 L'Arche International commissioned a report that found that Jean Vanier had had \\"manipulative and emotionally abusive\\" sexual relationships with six women between 1970 and 2005, usually in the context of giving spiritual guidance. The L'Arche community L‚ÄôArche homes and programs operate according to a not-for-profit ‚Äúcommunity model‚Äù which is distinct from \\"client-centered\\", medical, or social service models of care. At L‚ÄôArche, * people with disabilities, and those who assist them, live together in homes and apartments, sharing life with one another and building community as responsible adults. * everyone is believed to have the capacity to grow and to mature into adulthood, and to make a contribution to society, regardless of the physical or intellectual limitations with which they may be living; and * the important goals of achieving personal growth and maturing socially as an adult are things which are understood to be nurtured most effectively within the context of a community whose policies and practices support and promote, among other things: ** the development of long-term, mutual, interdependent relationships; ** the maintenance of a stable, life-giving home environment; ** the training and ongoing formation of those who provide assistance to community members with disabilities; and ** cooperation with outside professional care providers. L'Arche is a faith-based organization rooted in Christianity, but is open to people of any faith and people with no religious affiliation.Charter of L'Arche History In 1964, through his friendship with Father Thomas Philippe, a Roman Catholic priest of the Dominican Order, Vanier became aware of the plight of thousands of people institutionalized with developmental disabilities. Vanier felt led by God to invite two men, Raphael Simi and Philippe Seux, to leave the institutions where they resided and share their lives with him in a household in Trosly-Breuil, France. He named their home \\"L'Arche\\", which is French for \\"The Ark\\", as in Noah's Ark. A collection of audiovisual material from L'Arche Trosly-Breuil is available at the University of St. Michael's College at the University of Toronto. The first community in Canada, L'Arche Daybreak, was founded in 1969 in Richmond Hill, Ontario, near Toronto. Sue Mosteller, who lived with the Daybreak community for 40 years, acted as L'Arche's first International Coordinator after Jean Vanier. Dutch priest and spiritual writer Henri Nouwen also lived with the Daybreak community for several years until his death in 1996. He wrote about his experiences with Jean Vanier, L'Arche and the Daybreak community in his books The Road to Daybreak: A Spiritual Journey and Adam: God's Beloved. The institutional and community archives of the Daybreak community are located at the St. Michael's College, Toronto.L'Arche Daybreak fonds held at the John M. Kelly Library, St. Michael's College, Toronto. The first community in the UK was founded in 1973 in Barfrestone, Kent, through the efforts of Jean Vanier's sister, Th√©r√®se Vanier.Dr. Th√©r√®se Vanier (1923-2014) obituary, theglobeandmail.com; accessed 2 October 2014. L'Arche Kent has since grown into a community of three traditional L'Arche houses, a gardening project called \\"The Glebe\\" and supported living apartments for twelve people with disabilities. Although L'Arche communities are found in many different cultures and reflect the ethnic and religious composition of the locales in which they exist, they share a common philosophy and approach. People with developmental disabilities and those who assist them live and work together to create homes. The L'Arche Charter says, \\"In a divided world, L'Arche wants to be a sign of hope. Its communities, founded on covenant relationships between people of differing intellectual capacity, social origin, religion and culture, seek to be signs of unity, faithfulness and reconciliation.\\" The charter further outlines the objectives, the principles and the identity of L'Arche. All the Communities of the International Federation of L'Arche are committed to living these principles. In March 2008, the international councils of L'Arche and another organization for disabled people founded by Vanier, Faith and Light, met for the first time in joint meeting in Lviv, Ukraine. The international council of L'Arche was represented by 30 people from 14 countries, and the international council of Faith and Light was represented by 19 people from 17 countries, including France, Belgium, Switzerland, Great Britain, Ireland, India, Canada, US, Dominican Republic, Honduras, Brazil, Uganda, New Zealand, Philippines, and Italy. Funding L'Arche communities are funded differently, depending on where they are located. In Canada, the UK, France and other developed countries, they are funded by the relevant governmental body. In less economically developed countries they rely more on local donations and on donations from other L'Arche communities and worldwide. Sexual abuse investigation In February 2020, L'Arche published the results of an investigation which found that Vanier had engaged in \\"manipulative and emotionally abusive\\" sexual relationships with six women between 1970 and 2005, under the guise of giving spiritual guidance. In response, the organisation stated \\"we are shocked by these discoveries and unreservedly condemn these actions, which are in total contradiction with the values Jean Vanier claimed and are incompatible with the basic rules of respect and integrity of persons, and contrary to the fundamental principles on which L'Arche is based\\".

According to the , it has a population of people, making it the most populous city in Nueva Ecija and the fifth-most populous in Central Luzon. The city is popular for being home to more than 30,000 motorized tricycles, thus priding itself as the \\"Tricycle Capital of the Philippines\\" and its strategic location along the Cagayan Valley Road has made the city a major economic, educational, medical, entertainment shopping and transportation center in Nueva Ecija and nearby provinces in the region such as Aurora and Bulacan. It has also earned the moniker \\"Gateway to the North\\". Cabanatuan remained as Nueva Ecija's capital until 1965, when the government created nearby Palayan City as the new provincial capital. Nueva Ecija's old capitol and other government offices are still used and maintained by the provincial administration. After the campaign to become Highly Urbanized City has failed there is now a moved to convert the city into lone district instead which is more feasible. History Marker of Gen. Antonio Luna's Death Place Cabanatuan was founded as a Barrio of Gapan in 1750 and became a Municipality and capital of La Provincia de Nueva Ecija in 1780. Cabanatuan is the site of the historical \\"Plaza Lucero\\" and the Cabanatuan Cathedral, where General Antonio Luna was assassinated by Captain Pedro Janolino and members of the Kawit battalion. Cabanatuan lost the title of provincial capital in 1850 when the capital of Nueva Ecija was moved to San Isidro, another historic town. It was only in 1917, when the Administrative code was enacted, that Cabanatuan was restored as capital of the Province. However, in 1965, Congress created Palayan City, which has been the capital ever since. Map of the routes taken by the US Rangers in their Raid at Cabanatuan During World War II, the occupying Japanese built Cabanatuan Prison Camp, where many American soldiers were imprisoned, some of whom had been forced to endure the infamous Bataan Death March. In January 1945, elements of the U.S. Army 6th Ranger Battalion and two teams of Alamo Scouts marched behind enemy lines to rescue the prisoners in what became known as the Raid at Cabanatuan. As a result of the raid on January 30, 1945, victorious Filipino guerrillas, American troops of the U.S. Army 6th Ranger Battalion and Alamo Scouts celebrated having obtained the freedom of 500 American POWs. Soon thereafter, Philippine and American forces re-established the presence of military general headquarters and military camp bases of the Philippine Commonwealth Army, Philippine Constabulary 2nd Constabulary Regiment, and the United States Army in Cabanatuan from February 1, 1945 to June 30, 1946 during the Allied Liberation. Before long, the combined Philippine Commonwealth and American armed forces, in cooperation with local guerrilla resistance fighters and Hukbalahap Communist guerrillas, had liberated Central Luzon from Japanese Imperial forces, a campaign that lasted from January until August 1945. In 1957, the barrios of Mataas na Kahoy, Balangkare Norte, Balangkare Sur, Sapang Kawayan, Magasawang Sampaloc, Talabutab Norte, Talabutab Sur, Platero, Belen, Pecaleon, Pi√±ahan, Kabulihan, Pasong-Hari, Balaring, Pulong Singkamas, Panaksak, Bravo, Sapang Bato, Burol, Miller, Tila Patio, Pula, Carinay, and Acacia were separated from Cabanatuan and constituted into a separate and independent municipality known as General Mamerto Natividad. Cabanatuan was the epicenter of a very strong earthquake, 7.8 on the surface wave magnitude scale, at roughly 3 pm on July 16, 1990. It leveled some buildings, including the Christian College of the Philippines (Liwag Colleges) in the midst of class time, and killed 1,653 people. Conversion from town, component city to highly urbanized city Cabanatuan became a city by virtue of Republic Act No. 526, approved on June 16, 1950. In 1998, Cabanatuan was declared by then- president Fidel V. Ramos as a highly urbanized city however it failed ratification after the majority of votes in the plebiscite was negative. Cabanatuan was declared as highly urbanized city by President Benigno S. Aquino III under Presidential Proclamation No. 418 on July 14, 2012. A plebiscite scheduled on December 2012 was moved by the Commission on Elections to January 25, 2014 so as not to burden the poll body during its preparation for the 2013 local elections in the province. Incumbent Governor Aurelio Matias Umali, who had a strong voter base in the city, opposed the conversion and submitted a petition to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court issued a temporary restraining order on January 24, 2014. On April 23, 2014, voting 9-5-1, the Supreme Court granted a petition for certiorari filed by Nueva Ecija Gov. Aurelio Umali and declared as null and void Comelec Minute Resolution No. 12-0797 dated September 11, 2012 and Minute Resolution No. 12-0925 dated October 16, 2012 setting a date for the conduct of a plebiscite in which only registered voters of Cabanatuan would be allowed to vote. The province-wide plebiscite was rescheduled for November 8, 2014, but cancelled again because the Cabanatuan City government could not provide the necessary funds. No new date is to be set until the city government certifies that 101 million is available for the holding of the plebiscite.  Geography  Cabanatuan City is located in the rolling central plains of Luzon drained by the Pampanga River. The city stands southwest of the provincial capital Palayan City and north of Manila.

Design and development The Beriev Be-12 was a successor to the Beriev Be-6 flying boat, whose primary roles were as an anti- submarine and maritime patrol bomber aircraft. Though tracing its origins to the Be-6, the Be-12 inherited little more than the gull wing and twin oval tailfin configuration of the older aircraft. The Be-12 has turboprop engines, which gave it an improved speed and range over the Be-6. The Be-12 also had retractable landing gear, which enabled it to land on normal land runways, as well as water. The Be-12 was first flown on October 18, 1960, at Taganrog airfield, and made its first public appearance at the 1961 Soviet Aviation Day festivities at Tushino airfield. A total of 150 aircraft were produced, in several variations, with production ending in 1973. Operational history A Be-12 during take-off roll The Be-12 entered service with Soviet Naval Aviation, or AV-MF (Aviatcia Voenno-Morskogo Flota), in the early 1960s in the maritime patrol role, and is one of the few amphibians still in military service in the world. Initially its role was ASW patrol, but when newer missiles enabled United States Navy submarines to launch from further offshore it was converted to the search and rescue role (Be-12PS). Small numbers are still in service. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, some aircraft were converted to water bombers for the suppression of forest fires. During development of the Beriev Be-200 unique fire-fighting equipment was tested using a specially modified Be-12P, code-named \\"12 Yellow\\". After installation of the fire-fighting system, the aircraft was registered as RA-00046 and given the designation Be-12P-200. This modified Be-12 was also used to trial firefighting operations envisaged for the Be-200.Gordon, Sal'nikov and Zablotskiy 2006, pp. 79‚Äì80. According to figures released in 1993, the Russian Navy had 55 aircraft in service. By 2005 this had dropped to 12, and by 2008 there were only nine aircraft still in service. A surviving Be-12 is preserved at the Central Air Force Museum at Monino, outside of Moscow. Other examples exist at the Ukraine State Aviation Museum at Kiev, Ukraine and at the Taganrog Air Museum, in southern Russia.

It is an adaptation of the 1996 Broadway musical of the same name, in turn based on Giacomo Puccini's 1896 opera La Boh√®me. The film, which features six of the original Broadway cast members reprising their roles, depicts the lives of several Bohemians and their struggles with sexuality, drugs, paying their rent, and life under the shadow of AIDS. It takes place in the East Village of New York City from 1989 to 1990. Plot On Christmas Eve 1989, aspiring filmmaker Mark Cohen, and his roommate, Roger Davis, learn that the rent previously waived by their old friend and landlord, Benjamin \\"Benny\\" Coffin III, is due (\\"Rent\\"). Their former roommate Tom Collins shows up and gets mugged. Mark and Roger meet with Benny, who tells them he plans to evict the homeless from the nearby lot and build a cyber studio (\\"You'll See\\"). He offers them free rent if they get Maureen, Mark's ex-girlfriend, to cancel her protest against his plans, but they refuse. A street drummer, Angel, finds Collins and they bond since they both have AIDS. Roger, who is HIV-positive and a former drug addict, tries to compose his one last great song (\\"One Song Glory\\"). He's visited by his downstairs neighbor, Mimi, an exotic dancer and heroin addict (\\"Light My Candle\\"). On Christmas Day, Mark and Roger are visited by Collins and Angel (in drag), bearing gifts (\\"Today 4 U\\"). They invite Mark and Roger to attend Life Support, an AIDS support group. Roger turns them down, while Mark goes to fix Maureen's sound equipment. He runs into Joanne, Maureen's new girlfriend, who bonds with him as they discuss Maureen's promiscuity (\\"Tango: Maureen\\"). Mark arrives at the Life Support meeting (\\"Life Support\\"). He films the meeting for the documentary that he's making about people living with HIV/AIDS. Mimi visits Roger (\\"Out Tonight\\"). Roger, whose ex-girlfriend died of HIV/AIDS, rebukes her advances and throws her out (\\"Another Day\\"). The next day, he joins Mark, Collins and Angel at a Life Support meeting (\\"Will I?\\"). Leaving the meeting, the group imagines what it would be like to move to Santa Fe, New Mexico (\\"Santa Fe\\"). Roger and Mark leave to help Maureen set up for her performance, and Angel and Collins reveal they are falling in love (\\"I'll Cover You\\"). Maureen performs her song that calls out Benny for changing who he was when he got married and blames him for trying to shut down the tent city (\\"Over the Moon\\"). The performance starts a riot because Benny called in police to make sure the protest stayed peaceful, but it escalated into violence. Once the protest is over, the group goes to The Life Cafe and celebrates Mark selling his riot footage to a local news station (\\"La Vie Boh√®me\\" or \\"La Vie Boh√®me A\\"). Roger and Mimi reveal they are falling for each other, and reveal they are HIV positive (\\"I Should Tell You\\"). They share a kiss and continue celebrating with their friends (\\"Viva La Vie Boh√®me!\\" or \\"La Vie Boh√®me B\\"). On New Years Day, Benny has padlocked the apartment, but Angel breaks the lock with a garbage can. Mark takes a job at Buzzline, the television news program that he sold his riot footage to. After another fight, Maureen proposes to Joanne; the relationship ends when Maureen flirts with another woman at the engagement party (\\"Take Me or Leave Me\\"). After being persuaded by Mimi, his ex-girlfriend, Benny gives the group back their apartment. Over the following year, Roger grows distrustful of Mimi, and their relationship ends (\\"Without You\\"). Angel becomes more ill and dies in Collins' arms. At Angel's funeral, the group goes their separate ways after a bitter argument, although Maureen and Joanne reconcile in the process (\\"I'll Cover You/Goodbye Love\\"). Roger sells his guitar, buys a car, and moves to Santa Fe. He returns because he still loves Mimi. Mark quits his job at Buzzline to pursue his own film (\\"What You Own\\"). On Christmas Eve 1990, Mark and Roger reunite with Collins, who reveals that he has reprogrammed an ATM to dispense cash when someone inputs the code: A-N-G-E-L. Joanne and Maureen find Mimi on the streets, near death. Mimi and Roger reconcile, and he sings the song that he has written over the past year (\\"Finale A/Your Eyes\\"). Mimi appears to die but suddenly awakens. She tells them that she was heading to the light, but Angel told her to go back. As Mark's documentary is shown for the first time, the friends reaffirm that there is \\"no day but today\\" (\\"Finale B\\"). Cast=Main characters * Anthony Rapp as Mark Cohen, a struggling Jewish filmmaker and Roger's roommate. He was dumped by Maureen for Joanne. * Adam Pascal as Roger Davis, an HIV-positive ex-addict rock musician; Mimi's love interest. * Rosario Dawson as Mimi Marquez, an HIV-positive heroin addict and stripper; Roger's love interest. * Jesse L. Martin as Thomas B. \\"Tom\\" Collins, an anarchist and gay philosophy professor with AIDS; former roommate of Maureen, Roger, Mark, and Benny; Angel's love interest. * Wilson Jermaine Heredia as Angel Dumott Schunard, a drag queen and street musician who is suffering from AIDS, which he ultimately dies from; Collins' love interest. * Idina Menzel as Maureen Johnson, a bisexual performance artist and Joanne's girlfriend; Mark's ex-girlfriend. * Tracie Thoms as Joanne Jefferson, a lesbian Harvard-graduate lawyer and Maureen's love interest. * Taye Diggs as Benjamin \\"Benny\\" Coffin, III, landlord of the building in which Mark, Roger, and Mimi live and ex-roommate of Collins, Roger, Maureen, and Mark. Minor characters * Aaron Lohr as Steve * Chris Chalk as Street Vendor * Mackenzie Firgens as April * Shaun Earl as Waiter * Rod Arrants as Mr. Hansen * Mike Garibaldi as Mr. Grey * Jennifer Siebel Newsom as Receptionist * Sarah Silverman as Alexi Darling * Daryl Edwards as Mr. Jefferson * Anna Deavere Smith as Mrs. Jefferson * Kevin Blackton as Mr. Johnson * Bettina Devin as Mrs. Johnson * Joel Swetow as Mr. Cohen * Randy Graff as Mrs. Cohen Critical response Review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 46% based on reviews from 172 critics, with an average rating of 5.9/10. The site's critic consensus reads, \\"Fans of the stage musical may forgive Rent its flaws, but weak direction, inescapable staginess and an irritating faux- boho pretension prevent the film from connecting on screen.\\" On another review aggregator, Metacritic, the film received a score of 53 out of 100 based on 35 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Alternate ending In addition to four deleted scenes, the DVD release includes an alternate ending, showing all the main characters (including Benny, who was not present in the other ending) except Angel standing in the positions where they were during the \\"Seasons of Love\\" opening, all standing in a line of spotlights, with Angel's spot empty. Later in the scene, he enters from the side and walks down the line to take his place, stopping as he passes Collins to take his hand for a moment. Although this tableau is used in the finale of the musical, it was dropped from the film for fear that audiences may have wondered why Angel had returned or why the characters were lined up on stage again. In the commentary, Chris Columbus adds that he \\"didn't want audiences to think that everything was okay and Angel was alive again.\\" Differences between the stage and film versions * \\"Goodbye Love\\" was filmed in its entirety, but the second half was cut from the film because Columbus considered it somewhat of an emotional overload, as he states on the DVD's commentary track. * The film leaves ambiguous the death of Roger's girlfriend April, who dies before Rent begins. In the film, she is seen reading a doctor's report that she is HIV positive; it is stated that she has died, but nothing more is said. In the stage version, Mark explicitly states that April ended her life by slitting her wrists in the bathroom, and Roger found out about his HIV status in the suicide note. Chris Columbus states in the DVD commentary that a scene featuring April lying in the bathtub with her wrists slit was filmed, but cut because he thought it would be \\"too much\\".

Founded in 1973 and headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the CfA leads a broad program of research in astronomy, astrophysics, Earth and space sciences, as well as science education. The CfA either leads or participates in the development and operations of more than fifteen ground- and space-based astronomical research observatories across the electromagnetic spectrum, including the forthcoming Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT) and the Chandra X-ray Observatory, one of NASA's Great Observatories. Hosting more than 850 scientists, engineers, and support staff, the CfA is among the largest astronomical research institutes in the world. Its projects have included Nobel Prize-winning advances in cosmology and high energy astrophysics, the discovery of many exoplanets, and the first image of a black hole. The CfA also serves a major role in the global astrophysics research community: the CfA's Astrophysics Data System (ADS), for example, has been universally adopted as the world's online database of astronomy and physics papers. Known for most of its history as the \\"Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics\\", the CfA rebranded in 2018 to its current name in an effort to reflect its unique status as a joint collaboration between Harvard University and the Smithsonian Institution. The CfA's current Director (since 2004) is Charles R. Alcock, who succeeds Irwin I. Shapiro (Director from 1982 to 2004) and George B. Field (Director from 1973 to 1982).  History of the CfA  The Center for Astrophysics  Harvard & Smithsonian is not formally an independent legal organization, but rather an institutional entity operated under a Memorandum of Understanding between Harvard University and the Smithsonian Institution. This collaboration was formalized on July 1, 1973, with the goal of coordinating the related research activities of the Harvard College Observatory (HCO) and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) under the leadership of a single Director, and housed within the same complex of buildings on the Harvard campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The CfA's history is therefore also that of the two fully independent organizations that comprise it. With a combined lifetime of more than 300 years, HCO and SAO have been host to major milestones in astronomical history that predate the CfA's founding. These are briefly summarized below.  History of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO)  The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) on the South Yard of the Smithsonian Castle in Washington, D.C., in 1909. In 1973, SAO moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts and unified with the Harvard College Observatory to form the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Samuel Pierpont Langley, the third Secretary of the Smithsonian, founded the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory on the south yard of the Smithsonian Castle (on the U.S. National Mall) on March 1,1890. The Astrophysical Observatory's initial, primary purpose was to \\"record the amount and character of the Sun's heat\\". Charles Greeley Abbot was named SAO's first director, and the observatory operated solar telescopes to take daily measurements of the Sun's intensity in different regions of the optical electromagnetic spectrum. In doing so, the observatory enabled Abbot to make critical refinements to the Solar constant, as well as to serendipitously discover Solar variability. It is likely that SAO's early history as a solar observatory was part of the inspiration behind the Smithsonian's \\"sunburst\\" logo, designed in 1965 by Crimilda Pontes. In 1955, the scientific headquarters of SAO moved from Washington, D.C. to Cambridge, Massachusetts to affiliate with the Harvard College Observatory (HCO). Fred Lawrence Whipple, then the chairman of the Harvard Astronomy Department, was named the new director of SAO. The collaborative relationship between SAO and HCO therefore predates the official creation of the CfA by 18 years. SAO's move to Harvard's campus also resulted in a rapid expansion of its research program. Following the launch of Sputnik (the world's first human-made satellite) in 1957, SAO accepted a national challenge to create a worldwide satellite-tracking network, collaborating with the United States Air Force on Project Space Track. With the creation of NASA the following year and throughout the space race, SAO led major efforts in the development of orbiting observatories and large ground-based telescopes, laboratory and theoretical astrophysics, as well as the application of computers to astrophysical problems.  History of Harvard College Observatory (HCO)  The Harvard College Observatory, circa 1899. Harvard Square and the City of Boston are in the distant background. Most of the telescope domes in the foreground are no longer standing, but the largest dome in the top right of the photo, housing the 1847 \\"Great Refractor\\", still remains. The Great Refractor was the largest telescope in the United States until 1867. It was the first telescope to take a photographic image of the Moon. Harvard College Observatory \\"Computers\\" standing in front of Building C at Harvard College Observatory, 13 May 1913. The Center for Astrophysics exists at this same location today. Back row (L to R): Margaret Harwood (far left), Mollie O'Reilly, Edward C. Pickering, Edith Gill, Annie Jump Cannon, Evelyn Leland (behind Cannon), Florence Cushman, Marion Whyte (behind Cushman), Grace Brooks. Front row: Arville Walker, unknown (possibly Johanna Mackie), Alta Carpenter, Mabel Gill, Ida Woods. Partly in response to renewed public interest in astronomy following the 1835 return of Halley's Comet, the Harvard College Observatory was founded in 1839, when the Harvard Corporation appointed William Cranch Bond as an \\"Astronomical Observer to the University\\". For its first four years of operation, the observatory was situated at the Dana-Palmer House (where Bond also resided) near Harvard Yard, and consisted of little more than three small telescopes and an astronomical clock. In his 1840 book recounting the history of the college, then Harvard President Josiah Quincy III noted that \\"...there is wanted a reflecting telescope equatorially mounted...\\". This telescope, the 15-inch \\"Great Refractor\\", opened seven years later (in 1847) at the top of Observatory Hill in Cambridge (where it still exists today, housed in the oldest of the CfA's complex of buildings). The telescope was the largest in the United States from 1847 until 1867. William Bond and pioneer photographer John Adams Whipple used the Great Refractor to produce the first clear Daguerrotypes of the Moon (winning them an award at the 1851 Great Exhibition in London). Bond and his son, George Phillips Bond (the second Director of HCO), used it to discover Saturn's 8th moon, Hyperion (which was also independently discovered by William Lassell). Under the directorship of Edward Charles Pickering from 1877 to 1919, the observatory became the world's major producer of stellar spectra and magnitudes, established an observing station in Peru, and applied mass-production methods to the analysis of data. It was during this time that HCO became host to a series of major discoveries in astronomical history, powered by the Observatory's so-called \\"Computers\\" (women hired by Pickering as skilled workers to process astronomical data). These \\"Computers\\" included Williamina Fleming, Annie Jump Cannon, Henrietta Swan Leavitt, Florence Cushman and Antonia Maury, all widely recognized today as major figures in scientific history. Henrietta Swan Leavitt, for example, discovered the so-called period- luminosity relation for Classical Cepheid variable stars, establishing the first major \\"standard candle\\" with which to measure the distance to galaxies. Now called \\"Leavitt's Law\\", the discovery is regarded as one of the most foundational and important in the history of astronomy; astronomers like Edwin Hubble, for example, would later use Leavitt's Law to establish that the Universe is expanding, the primary piece of evidence for the Big Bang model. Upon Pickering's retirement in 1921, the Directorship of HCO fell to Harlow Shapley (a major participant in the so-called \\"Great Debate\\" of 1920). This era of the observatory was made famous by the work of Cecelia Payne- Gaposchkin, who became the first woman to earn a Ph.D. in astronomy from Radcliffe College (a short walk from the Observatory). Payne-Gapochkin's 1925 thesis proposed that stars were composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, an idea thought ridiculous at the time. Between Shapley's tenure and the formation of the CfA, the observatory was directed by Donald H. Menzel and then Leo Goldberg, both of whom maintained widely recognized programs in solar and stellar astrophysics. Menzel played a major role in encouraging the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory to move to Cambridge and collaborate more closely with HCO.  Joint history as the Center for Astrophysics (CfA)  The collaborative foundation for what would ultimately give rise to the Center for Astrophysics began with SAO's move to Cambridge in 1955. Fred Whipple, who was already chair of the Harvard Astronomy Department (housed within HCO since 1931), was named SAO's new director at the start of this new era; an early test of the model for a unified Directorship across HCO and SAO. The following 18 years would see the two independent entities merge ever closer together, operating effectively (but informally) as one large research center. This joint relationship was formalized as the new Harvard‚ÄìSmithsonian Center for Astrophysics on July 1, 1973. George B. Field, then affiliated with Berkeley, was appointed as its first Director. That same year, a new astronomical journal, the \\"CfA Preprint Series\\" was created, and a CfA/SAO instrument flying aboard Skylab discovered coronal holes on the Sun. The founding of the CfA also coincided with the birth of X-ray astronomy as a new, major field that was largely dominated by CfA scientists in its early years. Riccardo Giacconi, regarded as the \\"father of X-ray astronomy\\", founded the High Energy Astrophysics Division within the new CfA by moving most of his research group (then at American Sciences and Engineering) to SAO in 1973. That group would later go on to launch the Einstein Observatory (the first imaging X-ray telescope) in 1976, and ultimately lead the proposals and development of what would become the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Chandra, the second of NASA's Great Observatories and still the most powerful X-ray telescope in history, continues operations today as part of the CfA's Chandra X-ray Center. Giacconi would later win the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physics for his foundational work in X-ray astronomy. Shortly after the launch of the Einstein Observatory, the CfA's Steven Weinberg won the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on electroweak unification. The following decade saw the start of the landmark CfA Redshift Survey (the first attempt to map the large scale structure of the Universe), as well as the release of the \\"Field Report\\", a highly influential Astronomy & Astrophysics Decadal Survey chaired by the outgoing CfA Director George Field. He would be replaced in 1982 by Irwin Shapiro, who during his tenure as Director (1982 to 2004) oversaw the expansion of the CfA's observing facilities around the world, including the newly named Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory, the Infrared Telescope (IRT) aboard the Space Shuttle, the 6.5-meter Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT), the SOHO satellite, and the launch of Chandra in 1999. CfA-led discoveries throughout this period include canonical work on Supernova 1987A, the \\"CfA2 Great Wall\\" (then the largest known coherent structure in the Universe), the best-yet evidence for supermassive black holes, and the first convincing evidence for an extrasolar planet. The 1990s also saw the CfA unwittingly play a major role in the history of computer science and the internet: in 1990, SAO developed SAOImage, one of the world's first X11-based applications made publicly available (its successor, DS9, remains the most widely used astronomical FITS image viewer worldwide). During this time, scientists at the CfA also began work on what would become the Astrophysics Data System (ADS), one of the world's first online databases of research papers. By 1993, the ADS was running the first routine transatlantic queries between databases, a foundational aspect of the internet today.  The CfA Today  The first image of the photon ring of a black hole (M87*), captured by the Event Horizon Telescope. The CfA plays a central role in the project.  Research at the CfA  Charles Alcock, known for a number of major works related to massive compact halo objects, was named the third director of the CfA in 2004. Today Alcock overseas one of the largest and most productive astronomical institutes in the world, with more than 850 staff and an annual budget in excess of $100M USD. The Harvard Department of Astronomy, housed within the CfA, maintains a continual complement of approximately 60 Ph.D. students, more than 100 postdoctoral researchers, and roughly 25 undergraduate majors in astronomy and astrophysics from Harvard College. SAO, meanwhile, hosts a long-running and highly rated REU Summer Intern program as well as many visiting graduate students. The CfA estimates that roughly 10% of the professional astrophysics community in the United States spent at least a portion of their career or education there. The CfA is either a lead or major partner in the operations of the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory, the Submillimeter Array, MMT Observatory, the South Pole Telescope, VERITAS, and a number of other smaller ground-based telescopes. The CfA's 2019-2024 Strategic Plan includes the construction of the Giant Magellan Telescope as a driving priority for the Center. Along with the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the CfA plays a central role in a number of space-based observing facilities, including the recently launched Parker Solar Probe, Kepler Space Telescope, the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), and HINODE. The CfA, via the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, recently played a major role in the Lynx X-ray Observatory, a NASA-Funded Large Mission Concept Study commissioned as part of the 2020 Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics (\\"Astro2020\\"). If launched, Lynx would be the most powerful X-ray observatory constructed to date, enabling order-of-magnitude advances in capability over Chandra. SAO is one of the 13 stakeholder institutes for the Event Horizon Telescope Board, and the CfA hosts its Array Operations Center. In 2019, the project revealed the first direct image of a black hole. The result is widely regarded as a triumph not only of observational astronomy, but of its intersection with theoretical astrophysics. Union of the observational and theoretical subfields of astrophysics has been a major focus of the CfA since its founding. In 2018, the CfA rebranded, changing its official name to the \\"Center for Astrophysics  Harvard & Smithsonian\\" in an effort to reflect its unique status as a joint collaboration between Harvard University and the Smithsonian Institution. Today, the CfA receives roughly 70% of its funding from NASA, 22% from Smithsonian federal funds, and 4% from the National Science Foundation. The remaining 4% comes from contributors including the United States Department of Energy, the Annenberg Foundation, as well as other gifts and endowments.

About the everlasting peace between the nations During the battle at Olszynka Grochowska in defence of Warsaw in 1831, Wojciech Jastrzƒôbowski formulated a document which may be described as a project of the first constitution of Europe united as one republic without internal borders, with unified judicial system and institutions consisting of representatives of all nations. The document was named ‚ÄòAbout the everlasting peace between the nations‚Äô (‚ÄûO wiecznym pokoju miƒôdzy narodami‚Äù), and consisted of 77 articles. It was published on 3 May 1831 on the anniversary of the Constitution of 3 May 1791. In his text he suggested that all nations should renounce their freedom and become enslaved with the laws, all monarch should be henceforth the guardians and executors of these laws and should not be referred to with no other title than fathers of nations.

Legend His story is a variation on the well-travelled \\"faithful hound\\" motif, similar to the Welsh story of the dog Gelert. Guinefort the greyhound belonged to a knight who lived in a castle near Lyon. One day, the knight went hunting, leaving his infant son in the care of Guinefort. When he returned, he found the nursery in chaos ‚Äì the cot was overturned, the child was nowhere to be seen and Guinefort greeted his master with bloody jaws. Believing Guinefort to have devoured his son, the knight slew the dog. He then heard a child crying; he turned over the cot and found his son lying there, safe and sound, along with the body of a viper. Guinefort had killed the snake and saved the child. On realizing the mistake the family dropped the dog down a well, covered it with stones and planted trees around it, setting up a shrine for Guinefort. Guinefort became recognised by locals as a saint for the protection of infants. It was alleged by contemporary commentators that locals left their babies at the site to be healed by the dog: :The local peasants hearing of the dog's noble deed and innocent death, began to visit the place and honor the dog as a martyr in quest of help for their sicknesses and other needs. ::Stephen of Bourbon (d. 1262): De Supersticione: On St. Guinefort. The cult of this dog saint persisted for several centuries, until the 1930s, despite the repeated prohibitions of the Catholic Church. In popular culture The 1987 French film Le Moine et la sorci√®re (in the US known as The Sorceress) depicts the controversy over St. Guinefort as seen through the eyes of Fr. Etienne de Bourbon, a Dominican inquisitor and the author of the above passage. Thomas of Hookton, the main character in Bernard Cornwell's The Grail Quest trilogy (2000‚Äì2003), was a mock believer in Saint Guinefort, praying to the saint and wearing a paw on a piece of leather around his neck.

Phenotypic variation for quantitative traits is, at the most basic level, the result of the segregation of alleles at quantitative trait loci (QTL). Environmental factors and other external influences can also play a role in phenotypic variation. Genetic architecture is a broad term that can be described for any given individual based on information regarding gene and allele number, the distribution of allelic and mutational effects, and patterns of pleiotropy, dominance, and epistasis. There are several different experimental views of genetic architecture. Some researchers recognize that the interplay of various genetic mechanisms is incredibly complex, but believe that these mechanisms can be averaged and treated, more or less, like statistical noise. Other researchers claim that each and every gene interaction is significant and that it is necessary to measure and model these individual systemic influences on evolutionary genetics.  Applications  A very simple genotype-phenotype map that only shows additive pleiotropy effects. Genetic architecture can be studied and applied at many different levels. At the most basic, individual level, genetic architecture describes the genetic basis for differences between individuals, species, and populations. This can include, among other details, how many genes are involved in a specific phenotype and how gene interactions, such as epistasis, influence that phenotype. Line-cross analyses and QTL analyses can be used to study these differences. This is perhaps the most common way that genetic architecture is studied, and though it is useful for supplying pieces of information, it does not generally provide a complete picture of the genetic architecture as a whole. Genetic architecture can also be used to discuss the evolution of populations. Classical quantitative genetics models, such as that developed by R.A. Fisher, are based on analyses of phenotype in terms of the contributions from different genes and their interactions. Genetic architecture is sometimes studied using a Genotype-phenotype map, which graphically depicts the relationship between the genotype and the phenotype. Genetic architecture is incredibly important for understanding evolutionary theory because it describes phenotypic variation in its underlying genetic terms, and thus it gives us clues about the evolutionary potential of these variations. Therefore, genetic architecture can help us to answer biological questions about speciation, the evolution of sex and recombination, the survival of small populations, inbreeding, understanding diseases, animal and plant breeding, and more.  Evolvability  Evolvability is literally defined as the ability to evolve. In terms of genetics, evolvability is the ability of a genetic system to produce and maintain potentially adaptive genetic variants. There are several aspects of genetic architecture that contribute strongly to the evolvability of a system, including autonomy, mutability, coordination, epistasis, pleiotropy, polygeny, and robustness. * Autonomy: the existence of quasi-independent characters with the potential for evolutionary autonomy. * Mutability: the possibility that genetic mutation can occur. * Coordination: a phenomenon such as development, during which many different genetic processes and changes happen at once. * Epistasis: a phenomenon in which one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more \\"modifier\\" genes. * Polygeny: a phenomenon in which multiple genes contribute to a particular phenotypic character. * Pleiotropy: a phenomenon in which a single gene affects one or more phenotypic characteristics. * Robustness: the ability of a phenotype to remain constant in spite of genetic mutation.  Examples  A speculative framework for the evolutionary history underlying current-day phenotypic variation in human skin pigmentation based on the similarities and differences found in various genotypes. A study published in 2006 used phylogeny to compare the genetic architecture of differing human skin color. In this study, researchers were able to suggest a speculative framework for the evolutionary history underlying current-day phenotypic variation in human skin pigmentation based on the similarities and differences they found in the genotype. Evolutionary history is an important consideration in understanding the genetic basis of any trait, and this study was among the first to utilize these concepts in a paired fashion to determine information about the underlying genetics of a phenotypic trait. In 2013, a group of researchers used genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and genome- wide interaction studies (GWIS) to determine the risk of congenital heart defects in patients suffering from Down Syndrome. Down Syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by trisomy of human chromosome 21. The current hypothesis regarding congenital heart defect phenotypes in Down Syndrome individuals is that three copies of functional genomic elements on chromosome 21 and genetic variation of chromosome 21 and non-chromosome 21 loci predispose patients to abnormal heart development. This study identified several congenital heart defect risk loci in Down Syndrome individuals, as well as three copy number variation (CNV) regions that may contribute to congenital heart defects in Down Syndrome individuals. Another study, which was published in 2014, sought to identify the genetic architecture of psychiatric disorders. The researchers in this study suggested that there are a large number of contributing loci that are related to various psychiatric disorders. Additionally, they, like many others, suggested that the genetic risk of psychiatric disorders involves the combined effects of many common variants with small effects - in other words, the small effects of a wide number of variants at specific loci add together to produce a large, combined effect on the overall phenotype of the individual. They also acknowledged the presence of large but rare mutations that have a large effect on phenotype. This study showcases the intricacy of genetic architecture by providing an example of many different SNPs and mutations working together, each with a varying effect, to generate a given phenotype. Other studies regarding genetic architecture are many and varied, but most use similar types of analyses to provide specific information regarding loci involved in producing a phenotype. A study of the human immune system in 2015 uses the same general concepts to identify several loci involved in the development of the immune system, but, like the other studies outlined here, failed to consider other aspects of genetic architecture, such as environmental influences. Unfortunately, many other aspects of genetic architecture remain difficult to quantify. Although there are a few studies that seek to explore the other aspects of genetic architecture, there is little ability with current technologies to link all of the pieces together to build a truly comprehensive model of genetic architecture. For example, in 2003, a study of genetic architecture and the environment was able to show an association of social environment with variation in body size in Drosophila melanogaster. However, this study was not able to tie a direct link to specific genes involved in this variation.

Roy continued his academic career to earn a PhD from the Delhi School of Economics. His academic awards include the Leverhulme Trust (UK) Fellowship, Queen Mary Prize for results at BSc and an OPOS Scholarship at the Doon School to study at Haileybury College, and Chartered Accountancy from Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales in 1979-83. His paternal grandfather Paresh Lal Roy was called the 'father of Indian Boxing'. Paresh Lal Roy's younger brother Indra Lal Roy was the first Indian Ace, the first Indian pilot of Royal Flying Corp during World War I. Roy married his school friend Radhika Roy and they have a daughter Tara Roy. They are the adoptive parents of filmmaker Shonali Bose. Career Roy was a consultant for a few years at Price Waterhouse in India. He is a TV / digital journalist in India, an author and a professional British Chartered Accountant and Economist. He has been the lead anchor for election analysis and budget specials on India's national television network Doordarshan and for BBC World News' Question Time India. In 1988, Roy, along with his journalist wife Radhika, launched a television production house called New Delhi Television. Roy started his career with televised coverage of India's general elections. On Doordarshan, he hosted news programs \\"The News Tonight\\" and \\"The World This Week\\" (which were nominated as one of India's 5 best television programs since independence.) He also started India's first 24-hour English news channel NDTV 24x7. He has been an Economic Advisor in the Indian government's Ministry of Finance and an associate professor at the Delhi School of Economics, where he developed a macro-econometric forecasting model for the Indian economy. He has also been a consultant to the India division of international accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. In 2009 Roy was one of two Indians serving on the International Advisory Board of Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. He has co-authored A Compendium of Indian Elections and India Decides: Elections 1952‚Äì1991 with David Butler. Controversies The CBI had filed a criminal conspiracy case against NDTV managing director Roy in 1998 for alleging fraud in Doordarshan upgrade. In July 2013, Roy and NDTV were cleared by the courts and found not-guilty of all charges involving cases filed against Roy by the CBI under Section 120-B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for criminal conspiracy and under the Prevention of Corruption Act.NDTV and Prannoy Roy ‚Äì Once Upon a Time Zoom Indian Media (14 February 2011).CBI case against Prannoy Roy. The Indian Express. (20 January 1998). NDTV, through its foreign subsidiaries, is alleged to have violated Indian tax and corporate laws. NDTV has denied these allegations. The Sunday Guardian ran a story which exposed the NDTV's financial misdemeanours and malpractices in connivance with ICICI Bank. It provides details of how NDTV's major stakeholders raised funds by misdeclaration of the value of shares in NDTV. NDTV has denied the allegations and the NDTV CEO replied to the Sunday Guardian along with the threat of \\"criminal defamation\\". On 5 June 2017, the House of Prannoy Roy was raided by NIA and CBI. On 19 November 2015 the ED served notice to NDTV for alleged violations under the FEMA act, however the company said it has been advised that the allegations are not \\"legally tenable\\". The \\"Income Tax Appellate Tribunal\\" (ITAT) has upheld an income tax department finding that promoters of NDTV used their own shell companies to round-trip investments of during 2009-10, making them liable for recovery of tax and penalty. In September 2018, Roy and his wife Radhika were issued show cause notice by SEBI for violation of insider trading regulations though their company NDTV downplayed the notices stating they were seeking legal advice on the issue. Earlier that year, in the month March they were fined Rs 3 lac each by SEBI for disclosure lapses. In August 2019, the Central Bureau of Investigation filed a fresh case against Prannoy Roy, his wife Radhika Roy and former NDTV CEO Vikram Chandra for violating FDI rules and routing of tainted money of unknown public servants through shell firms. Securities and Exchange Board of India barred Prannoy Roy and his wife Radhika Roy from accessing the securities market for 2 years after an investigation revealed that they concealed material info from shareholders regarding loan agreements and hence they cannot hold management positions in NDTV board.

Dunn studied in London at Chelsea School of Art (1949‚Äì50) and at the Anglo-French Centre (1952) under Henry Moore and guest artist Fernand L√©ger before going to the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris, France in 1952.gallery78redfern-gallery.com Career Dunn's art has been exhibited in Europe and North America and can be seen at the Beaverbrook Art Gallery in Fredericton, New Brunswick, the Arts Council Collection in London, and many private collections. Two drawings and two paintings are in the Government Art Collection: U.K. Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Her first solo show was at the Leicester Galleries of London in 1957, with subsequent shows there in 1959, 1960, 1962, and 1964. Thereafter her major exhibitions took place in New York with shows at the Fischbach Gallery in 1967, 1969, 1972, 1975, 1977, 1979, 1982, 1985, 1987, and 1989. In 1990 Dunn had a solo show at the Christopher Hull Gallery in London. Richard Shone wrote in the catalogue: \\"Call these paintings landscapes if you must, fragments of nature. But Dunn is no 'impressionist', relating her findings with a nice exactitude of representation (though that is there too). Nor is she part of that tradition of landscape-abstraction, tightroping between 'pure' painting and the flora and fauna of the place itself. She needs the subject but needs the painting more. This is most clearly seen in the spectrum of her 'unreal' colour which, descriptive to a point, transcends the motif, is defiantly not its portrait.\\" Her most recent solo show was in 2005 at the Tibor de Nagy Gallery in New York.

From 1964 to 1968 she edited the journal Art and Literature with Rodrigo Moynihan, Sonia Orwell and John Ashbery. A taped interview with the artist is held by the National Life Story Collection at the British Library Sound Archive. Personal life Dunn's first husband was the artist Michael Wishart (1928‚Äì1996); they were married for 10 years before divorcing; by him, she has one son, Francis Wishart, a painter and winemaker. Michael Wishart's autobiography High Diver 1978 is dedicated to her and gives a touching picture of the artist as a young woman. Immediately after she and Wishart divorced, in 1960, Dunn married the Anglo- Spanish artist Rodrigo Moynihan (1910‚Äì1990), as his second wife. By him she has a son, Danny Moynihan, an artist and writer, as well as a stepson, John Moynihan. She has been painted and drawn by many fellow artists including Joe Brainard, Lucian Freud, and Rodrigo Moynihan. Dunn has links with France, Switzerland and New York City, but spends parts of her summers at a retreat on the Nigadoo River near Bathurst, New Brunswick.

Tip of the red-giant branch (TRGB) is a primary distance indicator used in astronomy. It uses the luminosity of the brightest red-giant-branch stars in a galaxy as a standard candle to gauge the distance to that galaxy. It has been used in conjunction with observations from the Hubble Space Telescope to determine the relative motions of the Local Cluster of galaxies within the Local Supercluster. Ground-based, 8-meter-class telescopes like the VLT are also able to measure the TRGB distance within reasonable observation times in the local universe. Method Hertzsprung‚ÄìRussell diagram for globular cluster M5. The red-giant branch runs from the thin horizontal subgiant branch to the top right, with a number of the more luminous RGB stars marked in red. The Hertzsprung‚ÄìRussell diagram (HR diagram) is a plot of stellar luminosity versus surface temperature for a population of stars. During the core hydrogen burning phase of a Sun-like star's lifetime, it will appear on the HR diagram at a position along a diagonal band called the main sequence. When the hydrogen at the core is exhausted, energy will continue to be generated by hydrogen fusion in a shell around the core. The center of the star will accumulate the helium \\"ash\\" from this fusion and the star will migrate along an evolutionary branch of the HR diagram that leads toward the upper right. That is, the surface temperature will decrease and the total energy output (luminosity) of the star will increase as the surface area increases. At a certain point, the helium at the core of the star will reach a pressure and temperature where it can begin to undergo nuclear fusion through the triple-alpha process. For a star with less than 1.8 times the mass of the Sun, this will occur in a process called the helium flash. The evolutionary track of the star will then carry it toward the left of the HR diagram as the surface temperature increases under the new equilibrium. The result is a sharp discontinuity in the evolutionary track of the star on the HR diagram. This discontinuity is called the tip of the red- giant branch. When distant stars at the TRGB are measured in the I-band (in the infrared), their luminosity is somewhat insensitive to their composition of elements heavier than helium (metallicity) or their mass; they are a standard candle with an I-band absolute magnitude of ‚Äì4.0¬±0.1. This makes the technique especially useful as a distance indicator. The TRGB indicator uses stars in the old stellar populations (Population II).

It was originally spoken in three villages near Aqrah in Iraqi Kurdistan. The native name of the language is Lishanid Janan, which means 'our language', and is similar to names used by other Jewish Neo- Aramaic dialects (Lishan Didan, Lishanid Noshan). It is nearly extinct, with only about 20 elderly speakers today.  Classification  Barzani Jewish Neo- Aramaic is classified as Afro-Asiatic, Semitic, and Aramaic language.  Origin and use today  The Jewish inhabitants of a wide area from northern Iraq, eastern Turkey and north western Iran, corresponding to the area of Kurdistan, mostly spoke various dialects of modern Aramaic. The turmoil near the end of World War I and resettlement in Israel in 1951 (when eight families from Bijil moved to the new Jewish state) led to the decline of these traditional languages. This particular and distinct dialect of Jewish Neo- Aramaic was spoken in the villages of Bijil, Barzan and Shahe. It was known as Bijili until recently. The last native speaker of Bijil Neo-Aramaic, Mrs. Rahel Avraham, died in Jerusalem in 1998. The remaining second-language speakers are all related and over 70 years of age, and most from Barzan. Other speakers are from Aqra. Barzan and Aqra are both located in Iraqi Kurdistan. The first language of these speakers is either Hebrew or Kurdish, and some also speak Arabic or another Neo-Aramaic dialect. Thus, the language is effectively extinct. Most of the speakers of Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic live in Jerusalem, Israel/Palestine today.  History  Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic is part of the Northeastern Neo-Aramaic (NENA) speech-type. Many of the NENA languages are seriously endangered, like Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic. Most of the NENA languages became endangered since most of the Aramaic speaking Jewry began to immigrate to Israel. This occurred mostly during the 1950s. Barzani Jewish-Neo Aramaic stands out from these languages because it began its endangerment in the early 1900s. This occurred in Kurdistan. The reason for the decline of the language was that most of the speakers were dispersed and integrated into communities that spoke other languages than Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic. This dispersal occurred violently in many of the communities by outside forces. Most speakers of Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic now speak Israeli Hebrew or Arabic.  Geographical Distribution  Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic is only spoken in Israel today. Speakers come mostly from Iraq.  Sounds and Phonology  There are 23 in the Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic alphabet and eight vowels. The letters can sound differently, making 35 distinct sounds.  Dialects and Varieties  Between the years of 1996 and 2000, three dialects of Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic were discovered. They are called Barzan, Shahe, and Bejil. Bejil is extinct. It may be related to Lishanid Noshan, which has clusters around Arbil to the south east of Barzan. There may be some similarities between Barzani and the subdialect of Lishanid Noshan formerly spoken in the village of Dobe, 50 km north of Arbil. The Sandu dialect of Jewish Neo-Aramaic is quite similar to Barzani. However, studies suggest that it has more in common with Lishana Deni. There is evidence that the language was also spoken in the nearby village of Nerim, but no speaker from that village remains. Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic has been infused with words from the Jewish Neo-Aramaic dialect of Zakho. This occurred due to the close proximity of the speakers of Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic and the dialect Zakho. This dialect is the most commonly spoken variant of Aramaic spoken in Jerusalem. This dialect is seen as more prestigious by the speakers and is most commonly understood.  Examples  Hezy Mutzafi has recorded and translated two texts in Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic.  Writing system  The alphabet used in Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic is the same alphabet used in modern Hebrew.

MIPS- based systems Initially, DeskStation designed and produced MIPS-based workstations, such as the DeskStation Tyne v4633x and DeskStation rPC44 (Evolution E4400 RISC PC and Evolution R4400 RISC PC), which conformed to the ARC computer specification (and implemented the associated firmware). Rather than adopt the Jazz reference design for its MIPS systems, DeskStation developed its own internal bus and chipset systems which offered greater performance compared to the more common Jazz machines. The resulting DeskStation machines began production in 1994, and had an initial price range from $2,990 for a basic system to $6,000 or more for machines with secondary cache and large memory configurations. Alpha-based systems Later, when Windows NT was ported to the Alpha architecture, DeskStation created a flexible computer platform that allowed either MIPS or Alpha architectures to be swapped either during production or by the end-user. These machines, part of the DeskStation Raptor series, were called the Raptor Reflex line.

Additionally, he wrote two novels. For his comic strip Pauline McPeril (a 1966-69 collaboration with Jack Rickard), he used the pseudonym Fulton, which is also the name of a character in his first novel, The Boss Is Crazy, Too. Biography Lazarus was born in Brooklyn, to Sydney Lazarus, a successful glass-blower, and Frances (n√©e Mushkin) Lazarus, nicknamed Frankie. Lazarus, who dropped out of high school, published his first cartoon at 16, and later enlisted in the U.S. Navy. During his twenties, he worked for Al Capp and his brother Elliott Caplin at the Capp family-owned Toby Press. In the mid-1950s, he created two children's syndicated comic strips for General Features,Lazarus entry, Who's Who of American Comic Books: 1928‚Äì1999. Accessed Oct, 25, 2018. Wee Women and Li'l Ones. Miss Peach debuted on February 4, 1957, in the New York Herald Tribune, and ended up running for nearly 50 years. His comic strip Momma debuted on October 26, 1970. Although Lazarus based the title character on his own mother, she believed the character was based on his aunt, exclaiming, \\"You caught Aunt Helen to a tee!\\" In 1964, Lazarus talked about his background and working methods: Mell Lazarus' Miss Peach of May 29, 1960. Lazarus served as President of the National Cartoonists Society for two consecutive terms, from 1989 to 1993. In 1992, Lazarus made a cameo appearance in the Murder, She Wrote episode \\"The Dead File\\". Books His novel The Boss Is Crazy, Too (Dial, 1963) concerns Carson Hemple, art director of a comic-book and confession-magazine publishing company, who is told by the owner to help force the company into bankruptcy, and who responds with inventive embezzlement schemes. The book was inspired by his time at Toby Press. The Neighborhood Watch (Doubleday, 1986) is about an impoverished Brooklyn writer who steals from his wealthy neighbors. Its protagonist, widowed father Loring Neiman, having turned to burglary when his book is rejected, discovers he has a knack for it. He prepares to give up the criminal life after becoming romantically involved with a married woman, but a criminally inclined neighbor coerces him into one purportedly final robbery. It was optioned for a movie. Awards Lazarus won the National Cartoonists Society's award for Newspaper Strip, Humor, in 1973 and 1979, both times for Miss Peach. He won the Reuben Award for Outstanding Cartoonist of the Year, for Miss Peach, in 1981, and the organization's Silver T-Square Award in 2000. On January 23, 2016, Lazarus became the second recipient of the National Cartoonists Society Medal of Honor, established the year before. Personal life Lazarus was married twice, first to Eileen Lazarus, which ended in divorce; then to Sally Mitchell, daughter of comic-strip gag writer Ed Mitchell. Lazarus lived in Los Angeles from the 1970s until his death on May 24, 2016. from complications from Alzheimer's. He had three daughters, Marjorie, Susan and Cathy. In popular culture Lazarus' membership in Mensa was mentioned in Season 10, Episode 22 of The Simpsons.

The long lagoon is linked to the sea by the Vridi Canal, while the Como√´ River flows into it. The lagoon averages 4 km (2¬Ω mi) in width, and in depth. Abidjan and towns such as Grand Bassam, Bingerville, Jacqueville, Att√©coub√©, and Tiagba lie on the lagoon. Geography The √âbri√© Lagoon is a long narrow lagoon complex located in the south of Ivory Coast. It lies parallel with the coast on an east/west axis and consists of several linked lagoons. At the eastern end it is linked by a channel to the Aghien and Potou Lagoons, into which the M√© River flows. The other major rivers flowing into the lagoon are the Komo√© River in the east, the Agn√©by River in the centre, and the Ira River in the west. At the western end, √âbri√© is linked by the Asagni Canal to the Tagba Lagoon and the Bandama River. It is connected to the Gulf of Guinea by the Vridi Canal, which was opened as a navigable channel in 1950. The natural mouth of the complex is at Grand-Bassam, but this tends to silt up during the dry season. There are several large and many small islands in the lagoon. The cities of Abidjan, Bingerville, Jacqueville, Att√©coub√©, Tiagba and Dabou lie beside the lagoon and it is crossed by four bridges. Sunset over √âbri√© Lagoon, with Abidjan in the distance The √âbri√© Lagoon has an area of approximately , a maximum length of , and a maximum width of . The average depth is and the maximum depth is . The amount of fresh water entering the lagoon varies with the time of year, but averages per year, and tidal exchanges with the sea average per year. The water is brackish, varying in salinity from 0 to 35‚Ä∞. It is also turbid and polluted, especially near Abidjan, with high levels of nitrogen and phosphate. Flora and fauna There are extensive areas around the lagoon dominated by mangroves such as Rhizophora racemosa, and the golden leather fern Acrostichum aureum. Elsewhere, there are floating aquatic plants in the bays and backwaters, and reeds, sedges and grasses at the edges of the water. The lagoon is separated from the sea by a sandbar and much of the terrain close to the lagoon is swampy, with taller vegetation and some trees. In the shallow parts of the lagoon there are a range of invertebrates including polychaete worms, nemertean worms, oligochaetes, isopods, amphipods and prawns. Over a hundred species of fish have been recorded in the lagoon, and it and the surrounding swamps are home to the African manatee, the pygmy hippopotamus, the Nile crocodile, the West African slender-snouted crocodile and the dwarf crocodile. Birds such as the African darter, the Pel's fishing owl, the white-crested tiger heron and the goliath heron breed here. Human use Pirogue on √âbri√© Lagoon Parts of the lagoon are highly polluted. Chemical pollution comes from the agricultural and industrial activity in the catchment area, with fertiliser run off occurring particularly in the wet season. Organic and bacterial pollution occurs mainly in urban areas, with high levels of Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens being detected. There is an artisanal fishery on the lagoon, employing about seven thousand people using four thousand boats with a potential annual catch of around . The bonga shad (Ethmalosa fimbriata) accounts for about 75% of the catch, especially in the more polluted waters near Abidjan where it is more abundant than other species. Other fish are found away from the urban areas in unpolluted waters, with the Atlantic bumper (Chloroscombrus chrysurus) and the Madeiran sardinella (Sardinella maderensis) being abundant, and the Guinean striped mojarra (Gerres nigri) and Senegal jack (Caranx senegallus) also contributing to the catch.

Early life and education He was born in Munich; his father, Augustin De Coster, was a native of Li√®ge, who was attached to the household of the Apostolic Nuncio to Bavaria in Munich, but soon returned to Belgium. Charles was placed in a Brussels bank, but in 1850 he entered the Universit√© libre de Bruxelles, where he completed his studies in 1855. He was one of the founders of the Soci√©t√© des Joyeux, a small literary club, more than one member of which was to achieve literary distinction. De Coster made his debut as a poet in the Revue trimestrielle, founded in 1854, and his first efforts in prose were contributed to a periodical entitled Uylenspiegel (founded 1856). A correspondence covering the years 1850 to 1858, his Lettres √† Elisa, were edited by Ch. Potvin in 1894. He was a keen student of Fran√ßois Rabelais and Michel de Montaigne, and familiarized himself with 16th-century French. He said that Flemish manners and speech could not be rendered faithfully in modern French, and accordingly wrote his best works in the old tongue. The success of his L√©gendes flamandes (1857) was increased by the illustrations of F√©licien Rops and other friends. In 1861 he published his Contes braban√ßons, in modern French. Career His masterpiece was The Legend of Thyl Ulenspiegel and Lamme Goedzak (1867), a 16th-century romance, which was barely read in Belgium because it did not meet up to the conventional standard of Belgian nationalism, but became popular over the rest of the world. In the preparation for this prose epic of the Gueux he spent some ten years. Uylenspiegel (Eulenspiegel) has been compared to Don Quixote, and even to Panurge. He is the type of the 16th-century Fleming, and the history of his resurrection from the grave itself was accepted as an allegory of the destiny of the race. The exploits of himself and his friend form the thread of a semihistorical narrative, full of racy humour, in spite of the barbarities that find a place in it. This book also was illustrated by Rops and others. In 1876 De Coster introduced Xavier Mellery to the island of Marken asking him to deliver drawings for the Tour du Monde magazine. In 1870 De Coster became professor of general history and of French literature at the military school. His works however were not financially profitable; in spite of his government employment he was always in difficulties; and he died in much discouragement in May 1879 at Ixelles, Brussels and was interred there in the Ixelles Cemetery. The expensive form in which Uylenspiegel was produced made it open only to a limited class of readers, and when a new and cheap edition in modern French appeared in 1893 it was received practically as a new book in France and Belgium. He was a freemason, and a member of the lodge Les Vrais Amis de l'Union et du Progr√®s R√©unis of the Grand Orient of Belgium, where he was initiated on 7 January 1858. The Legend of Thyl Ulenspiegel and Lamme Goedzak was illustrated by Nicolas Eekman in 1946.

Until the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act of 2011, it was a unique procedure in the patent law of the United States. Unlike in most other countries which had a first-to-file system, the former first-to-invent system of the U.S. allowed a party which has failed to file a patent application on time to challenge the priority of inventorship of another party which had a granted or pending patent, if certain requirements were met.  Definition  An interference proceeding is an administrative proceeding conducted by a panel of administrative patent judges (administrative law judges sitting on the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences) of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to determine which applicant is not entitled to the patent if both claimed the same invention in: # two or more pending patent applications, or # at least one pending patent application and at least one patent issued within a year of the pending application's filing date. A panel, composed of judges on the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences, a quasi- judicial body in the USPTO, hears an interference contest. Its final judgment adjudicating one party as an earlier inventor is called a priority award, or simply an award. Appeals from this tribunal are heard before either the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. See , .  Parties  At least two parties are involved in an interference proceeding: the inventor(s) or applicant(s) who filed an earlier patent application are called the \\"senior party\\", and the other inventor(s) or applicant(s) are called the \\"junior party\\". Both parties can be referred as \\"contestants\\", but that term is currently more likely to be used to describe the junior party. * Senior party: Merely being the first to file the application does not grant a party legal protection. It counts only as prima facie evidence that he or she is the first inventor. A senior party can also file a \\"motion to dissolve interference\\" to request the dismissal of challenges to its priority. * Junior party: A party other than the senior party bears the burden of proving that he is the first inventor. The proceeding's administrator considers certain factors, such as the invention's conception date and the inventor's diligence in reducing the invention to practice. Until the 1960s, a junior party was frequently called an \\"interferant\\".  Presumptions  Presumptions are stated in 37 C.F.R. 41.207(a): :(1) Order of invention. Parties are presumed to have invented interfering subject matter in the order of the dates of their accorded benefit for each count. If two parties are accorded the benefit of the same earliest date of constructive reduction to practice, then neither party is entitled to a presumption of priority with respect to the other such party. :(2) Evidentiary standard. Priority may be proved by a preponderance of the evidence, except a party must prove priority by clear and convincing evidence if the date of its earliest constructive reduction to practice is after the issue date of an involved patent or the publication date under 35 U.S.C. 122(b) of an involved application or patent.  Leahy-Smith America Invents Act  On September 16, 2011, President Obama signed the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act into law. Part of the Act changed the U.S. patent system from a first-to-invent system to a first-to-file system.http://www.uspto.gov/aia_implementation/bills-112hr1249enr.pdf As such, interference proceedings were eliminated from U.S. patent law. More specifically, any patent application with an effective filing date on or after March 16, 2013, cannot initiate an interference.http://www.uspto.gov/aia_implementation/aia-effective-dates.pdf Derivation proceedings are replacing interference proceedings in the patent statutes, but the dispute surrounding a derivation proceeding is unrelated to that of an interference proceeding.

The spacecraft was launched on 10 May 1971, however due to an upper stage malfunction it failed to depart low Earth orbit.  Background  In 1971, Mars was at its closest to Earth since 1956 and in May of that year both the Soviet Union and the United States made new attempts to reach the Red Planet. Kosmos 419 was intended to overtake the United States probes, Mariner 8 and Mariner 9, in the aim of becoming the first Mars orbiter. As it was, Mariner 8 was lost in a launch failure two days before Kosmos 419 was launched, and Mariner 9 went on to become the first spacecraft to orbit Mars.  Launch  Kosmos 419 was one of three Mars spacecraft launched by the Soviet Union in 1971, the others being Mars 2 and Mars 3; launched days after Kosmos 419. Unlike the 4M spacecraft, Mars 2 and 3, Kosmos 419 was a 3MS spacecraft which consisted only of an orbiter, with no lander. It was the ninth Soviet spacecraft launched to Mars.  Orbit  A Proton-K carrier rocket successfully put the spacecraft and a Blok D upper stage into a low earth parking orbit with an apogee of and a perigee of and an inclination of 51.4 degrees. The Blok D's ignition timer was incorrectly set, resulting in it failing to ignite; the timer had been set so that the stage would ignite 1.5 years after launch rather than the intended 1.5 hours. Due to its low orbit, which quickly decayed, Kosmos 419 reentered the Earth's atmosphere on 12 May 1971, two days after launch. The designation Kosmos 419 was a generic name given to Soviet spacecraft operating in Earth orbit; at the time Soviet planetary spacecraft which failed to depart Earth orbit would be given designations in the Kosmos series to disguise the failure. Had it departed Earth orbit, Kosmos 419 would have become Mars 2, a designation which was used instead for the next mission, 4M No.171.

G1, G2, and G3 are different genes that contribute to phenotypes P1, P2, and P3. Pleiotropy (from Greek œÄŒªŒµŒØœâŒΩ pleion, \\"more\\", and œÑœÅœåœÄŒøœÇ tropos, \\"way\\") occurs when one gene influences two or more seemingly unrelated phenotypic traits. Such a gene that exhibits multiple phenotypic expression is called a pleiotropic gene. Mutation in a pleiotropic gene may have an effect on several traits simultaneously, due to the gene coding for a product used by a myriad of cells or different targets that have the same signaling function. Pleiotropy can arise from several distinct but potentially overlapping mechanisms, such as gene pleiotropy, developmental pleiotropy, and selectional pleiotropy. Gene pleiotropy occurs when a gene product interacts with multiple other proteins or catalyzes multiple reactions. Developmental pleiotropy occurs when mutations have multiple effects on the resulting phenotype. Selectional pleiotropy occurs when the resulting phenotype has many effects on fitness (depending on factors such as age and gender). An example of pleiotropy is phenylketonuria, an inherited disorder that affects the level of phenylalanine in the human body. Phenylalanine is an amino acid that can be obtained from food. Phenylketonuria causes this amino acid to increase in amount in the body, which can be very dangerous. The disease is caused by a defect in a single gene on chromosome 12 that codes for enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, that affects multiple systems, such as the nervous and integumentary system. Pleiotropy not only affects humans, but also animals, such as chickens and laboratory house mice, where the mice have the \\"mini- muscle\\" allele. Pleiotropic gene action can limit the rate of multivariate evolution when natural selection, sexual selection or artificial selection on one trait favors one allele, while selection on other traits favors a different allele. Some gene evolution is harmful to an organism. Genetic correlations and responses to selection most often exemplify pleiotropy. History Pleiotropic traits had been previously recognized in the scientific community but had not been experimented on until Gregor Mendel's 1866 pea plant experiment. Mendel recognized that certain pea plant traits (seed coat color, flower color, and axial spots) seemed to be inherited together; however, their correlation to a single gene has never been proven. The term \\"pleiotropie\\" was first coined by Ludwig Plate in his Festschrift, which was published in 1910. He originally defined pleiotropy as occurring when \\"several characteristics are dependent upon ... [inheritance]; these characteristics will then always appear together and may thus appear correlated\\". This definition is still used today. After Plate's definition, Hans Gruneberg was the first to study the mechanisms of pleiotropy. In 1938 Gruneberg published an article dividing pleiotropy into two distinct types: \\"genuine\\" and \\"spurious\\" pleiotropy. \\"Genuine\\" pleiotropy is when two distinct primary products arise from one locus. \\"Spurious\\" pleiotropy, on the other hand, is either when one primary product is utilized in different ways or when one primary product initiates a cascade of events with different phenotypic consequences. Gruneberg came to these distinctions after experimenting on rats with skeletal mutations. He recognized that \\"spurious\\" pleiotropy was present in the mutation, while \\"genuine\\" pleiotropy was not, thus partially invalidating his own original theory.Gruneberg, H., 1938 An analysis of the \\"pleiotropic\\" effects of a new lethal mutation in the rat (Mus norvegicus). Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B 125: 123‚Äì144. Through subsequent research, it has been established that Gruneberg's definition of \\"spurious\\" pleiotropy is what we now identify simply as \\"pleiotropy\\". In 1941 American geneticists George Beadle and Edward Tatum further invalidated Gruneberg's definition of \\"genuine\\" pleiotropy, advocating instead for the \\"one gene-one enzyme\\" hypothesis that was originally introduced by French biologist Lucien Cu√©not in 1903. This hypothesis shifted future research regarding pleiotropy towards how a single gene can produce various phenotypes. In the mid-1950s Richard Goldschmidt and Ernst Hadorn, through separate individual research, reinforced the faultiness of \\"genuine\\" pleiotropy. A few years later, Hadorn partitioned pleiotropy into a \\"mosaic\\" model (which states that one locus directly affects two phenotypic traits) and a \\"relational\\" model (which is analogous to \\"spurious\\" pleiotropy). These terms are no longer in use but have contributed to the current understanding of pleiotropy. By accepting the one gene-one enzyme hypothesis, scientists instead focused on how uncoupled phenotypic traits can be affected by genetic recombination and mutations, applying it to populations and evolution. This view of pleiotropy, \\"universal pleiotropy\\", defined as locus mutations being capable of affecting essentially all traits, was first implied by Ronald Fisher's Geometric Model in 1930. This mathematical model illustrates how evolutionary fitness depends on the independence of phenotypic variation from random changes (that is, mutations). It theorizes that an increasing phenotypic independence corresponds to a decrease in the likelihood that a given mutation will result in an increase in fitness. Expanding on Fisher's work, Sewall Wright provided more evidence in his 1968 book Evolution and the Genetics of Populations: Genetic and Biometric Foundations by using molecular genetics to support the idea of \\"universal pleiotropy\\". The concepts of these various studies on evolution have seeded numerous other research projects relating to individual fitness. In 1957 evolutionary biologist George C. Williams theorized that antagonistic effects will be exhibited during an organism's life cycle if it is closely linked and pleiotropic. Natural selection favors genes that are more beneficial prior to reproduction than after (leading to an increase in reproductive success). Knowing this, Williams argued that if only close linkage was present, then beneficial traits will occur both before and after reproduction due to natural selection. This, however, is not observed in nature, and thus antagonistic pleiotropy contributes to the slow deterioration with age (senescence). Mechanism Pleiotropy describes the genetic effect of a single gene on multiple phenotypic traits. The underlying mechanism is genes that code for a product that is either used by various cells or has a cascade-like signaling function that affects various targets.  Models for the origin  One basic model of pleiotropy's origin describes a single gene locus to the expression of a certain trait. The locus affects the expressed trait only through changing the expression of other loci. Over time, that locus would affect two traits by interacting with a second locus. Directional selection for both traits during the same time period would increase the positive correlation between the traits, while selection on only one trait would decrease the positive correlation between the two traits. Eventually, traits that underwent directional selection simultaneously were linked by a single gene, resulting in pleiotropy. Other more complex models compensate for some of the basic model's oversights, such as multiple traits or assumptions about how the loci affect the traits. They also propose the idea that pleiotropy increases the phenotypic variation of both traits since a single mutation on a gene would have twice the effect.  Evolution  Pleiotropy can have an effect on the evolutionary rate of genes and allele frequencies. Traditionally, models of pleiotropy have predicted that evolutionary rate of genes is related negatively with pleiotropyas the number of traits of an organism increases, the evolutionary rates of genes in the organism's population decrease. However, this relationship has not been clearly found in empirical studies. In mating, for many animals the signals and receptors of sexual communication may have evolved simultaneously as the expression of a single gene, instead of the result of selection on two independent genes, one that affects the signaling trait and one that affects the receptor trait. In such a case, pleiotropy would facilitate mating and survival. However, pleiotropy can act negatively as well. A study on seed beetles found that intralocus sexual conflict arises when selection for certain alleles of a gene that are beneficial for one sex causes expression of potentially harmful traits by the same gene in the other sex, especially if the gene is located on an autosomal chromosome. Pleiotropic genes act as an arbitrating force in speciation. William R. Rice and Ellen E. Hostert (1993) conclude that the observed prezygotic isolation in their studies is a product of pleiotropy's balancing role in indirect selection. By imitating the traits of all-infertile hybridized species, they noticed that the fertilization of eggs was prevented in all eight of their separate studies, a likely effect of pleiotropic genes on speciation. Likewise, pleiotropic gene's stabilizing selection allows for the allele frequency to be altered. Studies on fungal evolutionary genomics have shown pleiotropic traits that simultaneously affect adaptation and reproductive isolation, converting adaptations directly to speciation. A particularly telling case of this effect is host specificity in pathogenic ascomycetes and specifically, in venturia, the fungus responsible for apple scab. These parasitic fungi each adapts to a host, and are only able to mate within a shared host after obtaining resources. Since a single toxin gene or virulence allele can grant the ability to colonize the host, adaptation and reproductive isolation are instantly facilitated, and in turn, pleiotropically causes adaptive speciation. The studies on fungal evolutionary genomics will further elucidate the earliest stages of divergence as a result of gene flow, and provide insight into pleiotropically induced adaptive divergence in other eukaryotes.  Antagonistic pleiotropy  Sometimes, a pleiotropic gene may be both harmful and beneficial to an organism, which is referred to as antagonistic pleiotropy. This may occur when the trait is beneficial for the organism's early life, but not its late life. Such \\"trade-offs\\" are possible since natural selection affects traits expressed earlier in life, when most organisms are most fertile, more than traits expressed later in life. This idea is central to the antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis, which was first developed by G.C. Williams in 1957. Williams suggested that some genes responsible for increased fitness in the younger, fertile organism contribute to decreased fitness later in life, which may give an evolutionary explanation for senescence. An example is the p53 gene, which suppresses cancer but also suppresses stem cells, which replenish worn-out tissue. Unfortunately, the process of antagonistic pleiotropy may result in an altered evolutionary path with delayed adaptation, in addition to effectively cutting the overall benefit of any alleles by roughly half. However, antagonistic pleiotropy also lends greater evolutionary \\"staying power\\" to genes controlling beneficial traits, since an organism with a mutation to those genes would have a decreased chance of successfully reproducing, as multiple traits would be affected, potentially for the worse. Sickle cell anemia is a classic example of the mixed benefit given by the staying power of pleiotropic genes, as the mutation to Hb-S provides the fitness benefit of malaria resistance to heterozygotes, while homozygotes have significantly lowered life expectancy. Since both of these states are linked to the same mutated gene, large populations today are susceptible to sickle cell despite it being a fitness- impairing genetic disorder.  Examples  Peacock with albinism  Albinism  Albinism is the mutation of the TYR gene, also termed tyrosinase. This mutation causes the most common form of albinism. The mutation alters the production of melanin, thereby affecting melanin-related and other dependent traits throughout the organism. Melanin is a substance made by the body that is used to absorb light and provides coloration to the skin. Indications of albinism are the absence of color in an organism's eyes, hair, and skin, due to the lack of melanin. Some forms of albinism are also known to have symptoms that manifest themselves through rapid-eye movement, light sensitivity, and strabismus.  Autism and schizophrenia  Pleiotropy in genes has been linked between certain psychiatric disorders as well. Deletion in the 22q11.2 region of chromosome 22 has been associated with schizophrenia and autism. Schizophrenia and autism are linked to the same gene deletion but manifest very differently from each other. The resulting phenotype depends on the stage of life at which the individual develops the disorder. Childhood manifestation of the gene deletion is typically associated with autism, while adolescent and later expression of the gene deletion often manifests in schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders. Though the disorders are linked by genetics, there is no increased risk found for adult schizophrenia in patients who experienced autism in childhood. A 2013 study also genetically linked five psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and autism. The link was a single nucleotide polymorphism of two genes involved in calcium channel signaling with neurons. One of these genes, CACNA1C, has been found to influence cognition. It has been associated with autism, as well as linked in studies to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. These particular studies show clustering of these diseases within patients themselves or families. The estimated heritability of schizophrenia is 70% to 90%, therefore the pleiotropy of genes is crucial since it causes an increased risk for certain psychotic disorders and can aid psychiatric diagnosis.  Phenylketonuria (PKU)  The blood of a two-week-old infant is collected for a PKU screening. A common example of pleiotropy is the human disease phenylketonuria (PKU). This disease causes mental retardation and reduced hair and skin pigmentation, and can be caused by any of a large number of mutations in the single gene on chromosome 12 that codes for the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which converts the amino acid phenylalanine to tyrosine. Depending on the mutation involved, this conversion is reduced or ceases entirely. Unconverted phenylalanine builds up in the bloodstream and can lead to levels that are toxic to the developing nervous system of newborn and infant children. The most dangerous form of this is called classic PKU, which is common in infants. The baby seems normal at first but actually incurs permanent intellectual disability. This can cause symptoms such as mental retardation, abnormal gait and posture, and delayed growth. Because tyrosine is used by the body to make melanin (a component of the pigment found in the hair and skin), failure to convert normal levels of phenylalanine to tyrosine can lead to fair hair and skin. The frequency of this disease varies greatly. Specifically, in the United States, PKU is found at a rate of nearly 1 in 10,000 births. Due to newborn screening, doctors are able to detect PKU in a baby sooner. This allows them to start treatment early, preventing the baby from suffering from the severe effects of PKU. PKU is caused by a mutation in the PAH gene, whose role is to instruct the body on how to make phenylalanine hydroxylase. Phenylalanine hydroxylase is what converts the phenylalanine, taken in through diet, into other things that the body can use. The mutation often decreases the effectiveness or rate at which the hydroxylase breaks down the phenylalanine. This is what causes the phenylalanine to build up in the body.\\"Phenylketonuria - Genetics Home Reference.\\" U.S National Library of Medicine. U.S. National Library of Medicine, Feb. 2012. Web. The way to treat PKU is to manage one's diet. Phenylalanine is ingested through food, so a diet should decrease types of foods that have high amounts of phenylalanine. Foods with high levels of protein must be avoided. These include breast milk, eggs, chicken, beef, pork, fish, nuts, and other foods. A special PKU formula can be obtained in order for the body to have protein.Slightham, Cindie. \\"Phenylketonuria.\\" Healthline. N.p., 13 Jan. 2016. Web  Sickle cell anemia  Photomicrograph of normal- shaped and sickle-shape red blood cells from a patient with sickle cell disease Sickle cell anemia is a genetic disease that causes deformed red blood cells with a rigid, crescent shape instead of the normal flexible, round shape. It is caused by a change in one nucleotide, a point mutation in the HBB gene. The HBB gene encodes information to make the beta-globin subunit of hemoglobin, which is the protein red blood cells use to carry oxygen throughout the body. Sickle cell anemia occurs when the HBB gene mutation causes both beta-globin subunits of hemoglobin to change into hemoglobinS (HbS). Sickle cell anemia is a pleiotropic disease because the expression of a single mutated HBB gene produces numerous consequences throughout the body. The mutated hemoglobin forms polymers and clumps together causing the deoxygenated sickle red blood cells to assume the disfigured sickle shape. As a result, the cells are inflexible and cannot easily flow through blood vessels, increasing the risk of blood clots and possibly depriving vital organs of oxygen. Some complications associated with sickle cell anemia include pain, damaged organs, strokes, high blood pressure, and loss of vision. Sickle red blood cells also have a shortened lifespan and die prematurely.  Marfan syndrome  Patient with Marfan Syndrome Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant disorder which affects 1 in 5‚Äì10,000 people. MFS arises from a mutation in the FBN1 gene, which encodes for the glycoprotein fibrillin-1, a major constituent of extracellular microfibrils which form connective tissues. Over 1,000 different mutations in FBN1 have been found to result in abnormal function of fibrillin, which consequently relates to connective tissues elongating progressively and weakening. Because these fibers are found in tissues throughout the body, mutations in this gene can have a widespread effect on certain systems, including the skeletal, cardiovascular, and nervous system, as well as the eyes and lungs. Without medical intervention, prognosis of Marfan syndrome can range from moderate to life-threatening, with 90% of known causes of death in diagnosed patients relating to cardiovascular complications and congestive cardiac failure. Other characteristics of MFS include an increased arm span and decreased upper to lower body ratio.  \\"Mini-muscle\\" allele  A gene recently discovered in laboratory house mice, termed \\"mini-muscle\\", causes, when mutated, a 50% reduction in hindlimb muscle mass as its primary effect (the phenotypic effect by which it was originally identified). In addition to smaller hindlimb muscle mass, the mutant mice exhibit lower heart rates during physical activity, and a higher endurance. Mini Muscle Mice also exhibit larger kidneys and livers. All of these morphological deviations influence the behavior and metabolism of the mouse. For example, mice with the Mini Muscle mutation were observed to have a higher per-gram aerobic capacity. The mini-muscle allele shows a mendelian recessive behavior. The mutation is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in an intron of the myosin heavy polypeptide4 gene.  Chickens  Chicken exhibiting the frizzle feather trait Chickens exhibit various traits affected by pleiotropic genes. Some chickens exhibit frizzle feather trait, where their feathers all curl outward and upward rather than lying flat against the body. Frizzle feather was found to stem from a deletion in the genomic region coding for Œ±-Keratin. This gene seems to pleiotropically lead to other abnormalities like increased metabolism, higher food consumption, accelerated heart rate, and delayed sexual maturity. Domesticated chickens underwent a rapid selection process that led to unrelated phenotypes having high correlations, suggesting pleiotropic, or at least close linkage, effects between comb mass and physiological structures related to reproductive abilities. Both males and females with larger combs have higher bone density and strength, which allows females to deposit more calcium into eggshells. This linkage is further evidenced by the fact that two of the genes, HAO1 and BMP2, affecting medullary bone (the part of the bone that transfers calcium into developing eggshells) are located at the same locus as the gene affecting comb mass. HAO1 and BMP2 also display pleiotropic effects with commonly desired domestic chicken behavior; those chickens who express higher levels of these two genes in bone tissue produce more eggs and display less egg incubation behavior.

He developed a rational, secular, naturalistic and mechanistic account of the world and of human beings and gave a materialistic explanation of the origin of the universe. His main work was the Lunheng (Ë´ñË°°, \\"Critical Essays\\"). This book contained many theories involving early sciences of astronomy and meteorology, and Wang Chong was even the first in Chinese history to mention the use of the square-pallet chain pump, which became common in irrigation and public works in China thereafter.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 344 Wang also accurately described the process of the water cycle. Unlike most of the Chinese philosophers of his period, Wang spent much of his life in non-self- inflicted poverty. He was said to have studied by standing at bookstalls, and had a superb memory, which allowed him to become very well-versed in the Chinese classics. He eventually reached the rank of District Secretary, a post he soon lost as a result of his combative and anti-authoritarian nature.  Life  Wang was born into a poor family in modern Shangyu, Zhejiang. Born a son of Wang Song, he was admired in his local community for his filial piety and devotion to his father.Crespigny, 806. With the urging of his parents, Wang travelled to the Eastern Han capital at Luoyang to study at the Imperial University. It was there that Wang became acquainted with the prestigious historian Ban Biao (3‚Äì54), the latter who initiated the Book of Han. He also befriended Ban Gu (32‚Äì92), the son of Ban Biao who made further contributions to the Book of Han. Since he was poor and lacked enough money to purchase proper texts of study, Wang had to resort to frequent visits to bookshops to acquire knowledge. Rafe de Crespigny writes that during his studies Wang was most likely influenced by contemporary Old Text realists such as Huan Tan (d. 28).Crespigny, 338. Due to his humble origins, Wang became resentful of officials who were admired simply because of their wealth and power and not for any scholarly abilities. Wang returned to his home commandery where he became a local teacher. He was elevated as an Officer of Merit, but due to his critical and quarrelsome nature he decided to resign from this position. Following this was a period of isolated retirement when Wang composed essays on philosophy, his Jisu (\\"On Common Morality\\"), Jeiyi (\\"Censures\\"), Zheng wu (\\"On Government\\"), and Yangxing shu (\\"On Macrobiotics\\"). About eighty of these essays were later compiled into his Lunheng (\\"Discourses Weighed in the Balance\\"). Despite his self-imposed retirement, he eventually accepted an invitation of Inspector Dong Qin (fl. AD 80‚Äì90) of Yang province to work as a Headquarters Officer.Crespigny, 152 806. However, Wang soon resigned from this post as well. Xie Yiwu, a friend of Wang Chong's and a long-standing inspector and official, made an official recommendation to the court requesting that Wang serve as a senior scholar under Emperor Zhang of Han (r. 75‚Äì88). Emperor Zhang accepted this and summoned Wang Chong to appear at his court, yet Wang claimed ill health and refused to travel.Crespigny, 806 & 895. Wang later died at home around the year 100. Although Wang's rationalistic philosophy and criticism of so-called New Text Confucianism were largely ignored during his lifetime, the prominent official and later scholar Cai Yong (132‚Äì192) wrote of his admiration for Wang's written works.Crespigny, 807. The official Wang Lang (d. 228) acquired a copy of Wang's Lunheng and brought it with him on his trip in 198 to the Han court established at Xuchang by Prime Minister Cao Cao (155‚Äì220). As some of the questionable tenets of the philosophy of New Text Confucianism fell out of use and repute, Rafe de Crespigny states that the rationalist philosophy of Wang Chong became much more influential in Chinese thought.  Work and philosophy  Wang Chong reacted to the state that philosophy had reached in China. Daoism had long ago degenerated into superstition and magic, and Confucianism had been the state religion for some 150 years. Confucius and Laozi were worshipped as gods, omens were seen everywhere, belief in ghosts was almost universal, and fengshui had begun to rule people's lives. Wang derided all this and made a vocation of giving a rational, naturalistic account of the world and the human place in it. At the centre of his thought was the denial that Heaven has any purpose for us, whether benevolent or hostile. To say that Heaven provides us food and clothing is to say it acts as our farmer or tailor ‚Äî an obvious absurdity. Humans are insignificant specks in the universe and cannot hope to effect changes in it, and it is ludicrous arrogance to think that the universe would change itself for us. Wang insisted that the words of previous sages should be treated critically, and that they were often contradictory or inconsistent. He criticized scholars of his time for not accepting this, as well as what he called the popular acceptance of written works. He believed that the truth could be discovered, and would become obvious, by making the words clear, and by clear commentary on the text. One example of Wang's rationalism is his argument that thunder must be caused by fire or heat, and is not a sign of the heavens being displeased. He argued that repeatable experience and experiment should be tried before adopting the belief that divine will was involved. He was equally scathing about the popular belief in ghosts. Why should only human beings have ghosts, he asked, not other animals? We are all living creatures, animated by the same vital principle. Besides, so many people have died that their ghosts would vastly outnumber living people; the world would be swamped by them. He never, however, explicitly denies the existence of ghosts (gui È¨º) or spirits (shen Á•û), he simply separates them from the notion that they are the souls of the dead. He seems to believe that the phenomena exist, but whatever they may be, they have no relation to the deceased. > People say that spirits are the souls of dead men. That being the case, > spirits should always appear naked, for surely it is not contended that > clothes have souls as well as men. (Lunheng) Wang was just as rational and uncompromising about knowledge. Beliefs require evidence, just as actions require results. Anyone can prattle nonsense, and they'll always be able to find people to believe it, especially if they can dress it up in superstitious flummery. Careful reasoning and experience of the world are needed. Bernhard Karlgren called his style straightforward and without literary pretensions; in general, modern Western writers have noted that Wang was one of the most original thinkers of his time, even iconoclastic in his opinions. They note that he gained popularity in the early 20th century because his ideas correspond to those that later evolved in Europe. His writing is praised for being clear and well ordered. But, because there was no functioning scientific method or larger scientific discourse in his time, his formulations can seem alien to the modern eye ‚Äî to some readers, even as peculiar as the superstitions that he was rejecting. But despite this barrier to his work, he gained some fame, though mostly after his death. He had an effect on what Karlgren called, the 'neo-Daoism' ‚Äî a reformed Daoist philosophy with a more rational, naturalistic metaphysics, without much of the superstition and mysticism into which Daoism had fallen.  Early scientific thought = Meteorology  With his acute rationale and objective approach, Wang Chong wrote many things that would be praised by later modern sinologists and scientists alike as being modern-minded. For example, much like Greek Aristotle's 4th century BC Meteorology portrayed the water cycle, Wang Chong wrote the following passage about clouds and rain: Wang's reference to Gongyan Gao's (i.e. Gongyan Zhuan's) commentary perhaps demonstrates that Gongyan's work, compiled in the 2nd century BC,Needham, Volume 3, 468, Footnote e. explored the topic of the hydrological cycle long before Wang wrote about the process. The historian and sinologist Joseph Needham asserts that: \\"As to the seasonal lunar and stellar connections, the thought of Wang Chong (about 83 AD) is that in some way or other the cyclical behavior of the qi on earth, where water is distilled into mountain clouds, is correlated with the behavior of the qi in the heavens, which brings the moon near to the Hyades at certain times.\\"Needham, Volume 3, 469. Thus, Wang Chong was uniting classical Chinese thought with radically modern ways of scientific thinking in his day.  Astronomy  Like his polymath contemporary Zhang Heng (78‚Äì139) and others before him, Wang Chong discussed theories about the causation of eclipses, with solar eclipse and lunar eclipse. However, Wang Chong's theory went against the correct 'radiating influence' theory supported by Zhang Heng (that the light of the rounded moon was simply a reflection of the light emanating from the rounded sun).Needham, Volume 3, 227, 411. Writing little more than a century before Zhang Heng, the mathematician and music theorist Jing Fang (78‚Äì37 BC) wrote in the 1st century BC: Zhang Heng wrote in his Ling Xian (Mystical Laws) of 120 AD: Going against the grain of the accepted theory, and thinking more along the lines of the 1st century BC Roman philosopher Lucretius, Wang Chong wrote: Although Wang Chong was certain of his ideas about eclipses (without the knowledge of how gravity forms naturally large spherical bodies in space), his ideas on this would not be later accepted in China. Although there were some figures like Liu Chi, writing in his Lun Tian (Discourse on the Heavens) of 274 AD that supported Wang's theory by arguing the inferior Yin (moon) could never obstruct the superior Yang (sun),Needham, Volume 3, 414-415. Liu was still outside of the mainstream accepted Confucian tradition. The Song Dynasty (960-1279) scientist Shen Kuo (1031‚Äì1095) supported the old theory of a spherical sun and moon by using his own reasoning about eclipses, which he explained were due to the moon and the sun coming into obstruction of one another.Needham, Volume 3, 415‚Äì416. The Chinese philosopher Zhu Xi (1130‚Äì1200) also supported this theory in his writing.Needham, Volume 3, 416. Although Wang Chong was right about the water cycle and other aspects of early science, his stern opposition to mainstream Confucian thought at the time made him a skeptic of all their theories, including eclipses (the Confucian-accepted model being correct).Needham, Volume 3, 413-414.

It originated the law of entail ‚Äì forbidding a landholder to sell his land except to his heirs.  Background  A form of entail has been known before the Norman feudal law had been domesticated in England. The common form was a grant \\"to the feoffee and the heirs of his body\\", by which limitation it was sought to prevent alienation from the lineage of the first purchaser. These grants were also known as feuda conditionata, because if the donee had no heirs of his body the estate reverted to the donor. This right of reversion was evaded by the interpretation that such a gift was a conditional fee, which enabled the donee, if he had an heir of the body born alive, to alienate the land, and consequently disinherit the issue and defeat the right of the donor. To remedy this the statute De donis conditionalibus was passed.  The statute  In 1285 the statute De donis conditionalibus enacted that in grants to a man and his heirs, the will of the donor as expressed in the grant should be followed. The donee should have no power to dispose of the land in any other way. After the donee's death, the land would be inherited by his heirs ‚Äì or if he had no heirs, then by the donor or the donor's heirs. Since the passing of the statute, an estate given to a man and the heirs of his body has been known as an estate tail, or an estate in fee tail (feudum talliatum). The word tail is derived from the French tailler, to cut, the inheritance being by the statute cut down and confined to the heirs of the body.  Criticism  It is claimed that the operation of the statute produced innumerable evils: \\"children, it is said, grew disobedient when they knew they could not be set aside; farmers were deprived of their leases; creditors were defrauded of their debts; innumerable latent entails were produced to deprive purchasers of the land they had fairly bought; treasons also were encouraged, as estates tail were not liable to forfeiture longer than for the tenant's life\\".Williams, Real Property On the other hand, by limiting inheritance to the eldest son, the other issue were forced to seek employment elsewhere, thus, it has been argued, preventing the growth of a landed caste. The professions of the church, the army and the law were constantly recruited from the younger sons of landed families, preventing the gap between nobility and the rest.Warner and Marten, Groundwork of British History  Aftermath  The power of alienation was reintroduced by the judges in Taltarum's Case (Year Book, 12 Edward IV., 1472) by means of a fictitious suit or recovery which had originally been devised by the regular clergy for evading the statutes of Mortmain. This was abolished by the Fines and Recoveries Act 1833, which provided an alternative means of barring entails.

It was established in 2001 and operates globally. Office bases include London (Head Office), Cardiff, Edinburgh, Belfast, Beijing, Mexico City, Amsterdam, Pretoria, Singapore and Washington DC.  Services =Business advice The Carbon Trust looks at current and future sustainability challenges and works with business and organisations to develop sustainable strategies to deliver savings. Carbon footprinting, verification and Carbon Trust standard The Carbon Trust provides voluntary carbon certification services and carbon labelling schemes ‚Äì it verifies organisation and product carbon footprint data and provides marks of quality to organisations to demonstrate standards have been met. Developing clean technology The Carbon Trust works with governments, innovators and corporates with the aim of accelerating the commercialisation of low carbon technologies, and leads projects to deliver commercial partnerships and develop low carbon technologies. It is particularly active in the areas of offshore wind, marine energy, fuel cell development and industrial energy efficiency. One such project is the Offshore Wind Accelerator, which is aimed at reducing the cost of wind power through projects focused in the North Sea. The Offshore Wind Accelerator is a partnership between industry and governments. Programmes and Innovations The Carbon Trust provides analysis on sustainability issues to help businesses, investors and policy makers with their roles in reducing carbon and saving energy. It works with companies and governments across the world.  Carbon footprinting, verification and Carbon Trust standard = Carbon Trust standards  The Carbon Trust runs a series of environmental standards that certify measurement and reduction. Currently these cover carbon, water and waste and have been awarded to hundreds of leading companies and organisations across the world. In June 2008 the Carbon Trust introduced the Carbon Trust Carbon Standard to address what it describes as business greenwash. The Carbon Trust Carbon Standard is only awarded to companies and organisations who measure and reduce their carbon emissions year on year. Examples of organisations who have held the Carbon Standard include Sky, Aldi, Eurotunnel, Bupa, Pricewaterhousecoopers, Samsung Electronics, Angus Council, Capital & Regional, O2, RWE npower, Credit Suisse, and the Scottish Government. In February 2013 the Carbon Trust introduced the Carbon Trust Water Standard to recognise those companies reducing their water use year on year. The first four companies to receive the Water Standard were Sainsbury's, Coca-Cola Enterprises Ltd, Sunlight Services Group, and Branston. In July 2013 the Carbon Trust introduced the Carbon Trust Waste Standard. In November 2013 the waste standard was awarded to the first wave of organisations, which included the Football Association, Renishaw plc, Whitbread, Pricewaterhousecoopers and AkzoNobel Decorative Paints. These last three became the first in the world to gain the triple crown of reaching the carbon, water and waste standard. In 2015 the Carbon Trust launched the Carbon Trust Supply Chain Standard to look at carbon footprints across the supply chain. It is the world's first independent certification for organisations that are measuring, managing and reducing greenhouse gas (CO2e) emissions in their supply chains. Carbon footprint label The Carbon Trust helps companies to measure the carbon emissions associated with their products (embodied emissions) and also provides a label for these products carbon footprint. Measuring the embodied emissions of products enables reductions to be identified and achieved across the supply chain. The label demonstrates a commitment by the product owner to reduce that footprint every two years. The Carbon Reduction Label was introduced in March 2007. Examples of products that have featured the carbon footprint label are Evian water, Tetra Pak packaging, Kingsmill bread, Quorn foods, Silver Spoon sugar, Walkers crisps, a range of own brand products in Tesco supermarkets, Halifax (HBOS) bank accounts, Dyson airblades, Marshalls building products, Quaker oats, Lafarge cement, and Pompeian Olive Oil. The standards behind carbon labelling are now formally recognised through the PAS 2050 developed by the Carbon Trust in conjunction with BSI and Defra. This methodology is now gaining international acceptance following its launch in October 2008.

American military commissaries sell groceries and household goods to active-duty, Guard, Reserve, and retired members of all eight uniformed services of the United States and eligible members of their families at cost plus surcharge, saving authorized patrons thousands of dollars compared to civilian supermarkets.  History  Fort Lee The commissary benefit is not a recent innovation. Sales of goods from commissary department storehouses to military personnel began in 1825, when U.S. Army officers at specified posts could make purchases at cost for their personal use; by 1841, officers could also purchase items for members of their immediate families. However, the modern era of sales commissaries is considered to have actually begun in 1867, when enlisted men received the same at-cost purchasing privileges officers had already enjoyed for four decades. No geographic restrictions were placed upon these sales; the commissary warehouse at every Army post could become a sales location, whether they were located on the frontier or near a large city. From the start, commissaries were meant to take on-post retail functions out of the hands of civilian vendors and post traders and allow the Army to \\"care for its own.\\" The stores provided food beyond what was supplied in the official rations, and the savings they provided supplemented military pay. The modern concept of commissary sales stores, which were established to benefit military personnel of all ranks by providing healthful foods at cost, reached its 150th anniversary on July 1, 2017. The commissary retail function developed and grew, roughly parallel to the development of the retail grocery industry. The commissaries‚Äô 82-item stock list of 1868 was comparable to the stock assortment in a typical civilian dry goods grocery store at that time. Commissaries kept pace with developments in civilian supermarkets, and the average commissary today has more than 12,000 line items; the largest stores have several thousand more. The list of eligible shoppers has also grown. Originally, only active-duty Army personnel could shop. Today, personnel in all services, including the Coast Guard and National Guard and Reserves, may shop in the commissary on any U.S. military installation, around the world. Military retirees ‚Äì those who have served in uniform 20 years or more ‚Äì were first allowed to make commissary purchases in 1878, and they continue to have shopping privileges. Spouses and dependent children of service personnel are authorized commissary privileges, as are recipients of the Medal of Honor, and veterans honorably discharged from service with 100% disability in connection with military service also have authorized commissary privileges. As the role of the American military grew larger, commissaries began to spread around the world. The first overseas stores opened in Cuba, the Philippines and in China between 1898 and 1904. They were soon followed by commissaries in Panama and Puerto Rico. Eventually, all the services adopted the Army's concept of commissary sales stores and tailored the concept to their own needs. The Navy and Marine Corps opened their first commissaries in 1909 and 1910, and the Air Force inherited its stores from the Army Air Forces in 1947 and 1948. By the mid-1970s, each of the services ran its own commissary agency, with differing procedures and systems: the Army Troop Support Agency (TSA), the Navy Resale System Support Office (NAVRESSO), the Commissary Section of the Marine Corps Services Command, and the Air Force Commissary Service (AFCOMS).  Separate systems combined  In 1989, Congress directed DoD to conduct a study of the separate military commissary systems. The ensuing report by the Jones Commission (headed by Army Lt. Gen. Donald E. Jones) recommended consolidating the service systems into one agency to improve service and save money. The Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) was established May 15, 1990, by a memorandum from the deputy secretary of defense; this was the first DoD functional agency consolidation during the post-Cold War cutbacks and downsizing. DoD appointed Army Maj. Gen. John P. Dreska as the agency's first director in June 1990. Shortly afterward, a transition team of commissary functional experts managed the consolidation of all the service systems into a single agency, and DeCA assumed full control of all commissaries on Oct. 1, 1991, at its headquarters in Fort Lee, Va. After leading DeCA through its initial year of operation, Dreska retired in 1992, and Army Maj. Gen. Richard E. Beale Jr. became the new director. Beale retired from the military Sept. 30, 1996, but stayed on the job as the first civilian director of the agency. He was succeeded by Air Force Maj. Gen. Robert J. Courter Jr. (November 1999 to August 2002) and Air Force Maj. Gen. Michael P. Wiedemer (August 2002 to October 2004). Patrick B. Nixon, who served as director and CEO from October 2004 to October 2007, was the first person in U.S. history to become director of any commissary agency after beginning his career at store level and steadily rising through the commissaries' civilian career field. Following Nixon's retirement, Richard S. Page served as acting director until the arrival of director and CEO, Philip E. Sakowitz Jr., in June 2008. Thomas E. Milks was acting director and CEO, from Sakowitz's June 2010 retirement until Joseph H. Jeu succeeded Sakowitz 3 June 2011. DeCA News Release Number 03-11 Joseph H. Jeu subsequently served as the director and CEO from January 2011 until his retirement in June 2017. Michael Dowling served as acting director and CEO following Jeu‚Äôs retirement. On Oct. 24, DOD announced retired Rear Adm. Robert J. Bianchi as the interim director and CEO. Bianchi is also the CEO of the Navy Exchange Service Command.  Authorized commissary patrons  Authority to shop at Commissaries is normally determined by presentation of the U.S. Uniformed Services Privilege and Identification Card or a Common Access Card. At some military bases authorized patrons are allowed to bring guests into the commissaries. Guests are not authorized to make commissary purchases, and patrons are not permitted to make commissary purchases for guests. Base commanders can order the restriction of guests to the commissaries. Commissary privileges overseas are covered under Status of Forces Agreements (SOFA), Visiting Forces agreements, treaties, etc. Since products sold in overseas commissaries pass across international borders and are customs, duty, and tax free; there are shopping restrictions.  Authorized patrons  * Active duty members of the United States Armed Forces. *DeCA employees * Members of the Reserve and National Guard. * Retired members of Active Duty, Reserves, and the National Guard. * Retired Reservist and National Guardsmen not yet age 60 (Gray Area). * Honorably discharged veterans with 100 percent service-connected disability certified by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). * Recipients of the Medal of Honor. *Since Jan 2020, Recipients of the Purple Heart. *Since Jan 2020, Disabled Veterans*. *Since Jan 2020, Caregivers for Disabled Veterans*. *Since Jan 2020, former POW's. *Patron eligibility documentation required is primarily based on VA letter for caregivers and VA VID. Some newly categorized patrons receive an additional charge on top of regular Surcharge to satisfy U.S. Treasury fees to avoid a hit on taxpayers.  Eligible dependents  * Spouses of Military Servicemembers, Military Retirees, Recipients of the Medal of Honor and Veterans with 100 percent service-connected disability are entitled to full commissary privileges. * Children until their military-parent leaves the service (without a full combat related disability) or they reach the age of 21 or age 23 if enrolled in college full-time.  Survivors  * Spouses of fallen Servicemembers in combat have unlimited commissary privileges. * Unmarried children of the deceased servicemembers in the line of duty may use commissary privileges, until they are twenty-one, or twenty-three if enrolled in a full-time course of study in a secondary school or in a full- time course of study in an institution of higher education.  Personal agent  Authorized Commissary patron may designate an agent or representative, on a temporary basis not to exceed one year, to accompany and assist an authorized patron to the commissary under the following conditions: * In extreme hardship cases. * When no adult dependent member is capable of shopping due to injury, illness, incapacitation or being stationed away from their household (i.e. deployment, TDY, school, training). * Any person chosen by a blinded or other severely disabled eligible patron to assist the patron. The personal agent will be provided official agent credentials or an approval letter, and then may enter any commissary to shop on behalf of the authorized patron. Only an installation commander can authorize agent privileges.  Guard/Reserve On-Site Sales  Guard/Reserve On-Site Sales is a program that allows Guard/Reserve members and their families, and any authorized shopper living long distances from a commissary store. The sales which provide patrons significant savings; the same as active duty military personnel that shop regularly at the commissaries. Guard/Reserve On-Site Sales are held at Reserve Centers, National Guard armories and Air National Guard bases.  Commissaries today  Today's customers also pay a surcharge on their purchases, which was mandated by Congress in 1952 to make commissaries more self-sustaining. The surcharge, which has been set at 5 percent since April 1983, provides modern shopping facilities for service members at a reduced cost to taxpayers. Unlike a tax, surcharge funds go right back into the commissary to work for commissary customers, paying for the cost of building new stores, renovating and repairing existing ones and purchasing equipment and store-level information technology systems such as cash registers. Commissary patrons worldwide save thousands of dollars annually on their grocery bills. Customers can use manufacturer's coupons to save even more on their commissary purchases. Annual sales now are nearly $5 billion. Surveys consistently rate the commissaries as one of the military's top non-pay benefits. Many young service families, particularly those stationed in high cost-of-living urban areas, simply could not make ends meet without the price savings provided by the commissaries. DeCA has delivered more than $2 in savings to customers for every taxpayer dollar used to support the commissary system. In other words, preserving this level of compensation in direct dollar payments to military personnel would cost the government more than twice the current fund appropriation.

Although his most famous novel, La Rue Cases-N√®gres, was published some twenty years after the great authors of Negritude published their works, Zobel was once asked if he considered himself \\"the novelist of Negritude\\".Warner, Keith Q., 1979. Foreword: We All Had a M'man Tine. Black Shack Alley, 1996.  Biography = Literary Beginnings and Influences  Joseph Zobel grew up with the support and unconditional love his grandmother and his mother. His mother, Delia, was forced to work as a nanny for a B√©k√©s (white Creoles) family, the Des Grotte family, in Fort-de-France, the capital of Martinique. Young Zobel was a brilliant student, earning himself a scholarship that allowed him to pursue an education and finish high school. After finishing his high school studies, he had hoped to study architecture in Paris. Unfortunately, he did not have the funds or another scholarship to help pay for such endeavors. Instead, he got his first job with the Corps of Bridges, Waters and Forests which forced him to move closer to the water in South Martinique, specifically to the towns of Diamant and Saint-Esprit. ‚ÄúJoseph Zobel‚Äù, sur √éle en √éle, le site des litt√©ratures insulaires francophones (CUNY). His time in Diamant and Saint-Esprit allowed him to become well acquainted with the local fishermen and to learn more about their lifestyle, which would later influence his popular novel La Rue Cases-N√®gres. Despite gaining an appreciation for the lifestyle on the coast, he couldn't forget the values he grew up with in the more rural inland of Martinique. During World War II, there was a blockade on the French West Indies preventing anybody, including Zobel, from leaving Martinique or traveling to France. ‚ÄúJoseph Zobel‚Äù, sur √éle en √éle, le site des litt√©ratures insulaires francophones (CUNY). While he was in Martinique, he worked as a teacher and then a school master of Lyc√©e Victor-Sch≈ìlcher, a boarding school in Fort-de- France. In the meantime, he found ways to express himself by writing short stories. His friends would read the stories for him. One friend, a fellow physical education teacher, brought the stories to a newspaper called Le Sportif who published the stories with popular success. The Martiniquais appreciated Zobel‚Äôs stories because they accurately portrayed the habits and customs of the island and its people without exaggerating the exoticism of their lifestyle. Aim√© C√©saire, a young agr√©g√© at the time, taught in the same high school as Zobel. He had an appreciation for Zobel‚Äôs writings and encouraged him to write a novel. Inspired by his experience working in the village of fishers in Diamant, Zobel wrote Diab‚Äô-l√† in 1942. It was a story about a peasant who decided to win his freedom by working the land near a community of fishermen. When Zobel first wanted to publish the novel, Martinique was governed by Admiral Robert, an authoritarian representative of the Vichy government, delaying publication until 1947.V√©ronique Larose, ‚ÄúPawol Kreyol¬ª. Joseph Zobel, artisan du Temps‚Äù, sur potomitan.info, site de promotion des cultures et des langues cr√©oles.  Time in France and Literary Career  In 1946, Zobel took advantage of his administrative leave and went to Paris to continue his studies. In Sorbonne, he took courses in literature, dramatic art, and ethnology. Additionally, he earned a position as an assistant professor at the Lyc√©e Fran√ßois 1er de Fontainebleau. Settled in Fontainebleau with his wife and three children, Zobel devoted the 1950s to intense literary activity and writing. He published numerous novels such as Les Jours Immobiles and La F√™te √† Paris. He also wrote many poems which he recited at various festivals in France, Switzerland, and Italy. Most notably, in 1950, Zobel published one of his principle works, La Rue Cases-N√®gres, a story greatly influenced by his childhood and time in Martinique. The story recounts a child, without much experience in the world, and a grandmother, who is experienced but softens her perspective of the world, resulting in a rare testimony to the West Indian Black community at the time. The √âditions Albin Michel refused to publish the text because of the Creole-inspired phrases. It was Alioune Diop who finally published La Rue Cases-N√®gres in his newly created publishing house and magazine, Pr√©sence Africaine. The novel proceeded to go down in history in France and in the African continent.Kidi Bebey, ‚ÄúLa Rue Cases-N√®gres passe par la case bande dessin√©e‚Äù, Le Monde, 30 March 2018.V√©ronique Larose, ‚ÄúPawol Kreyol¬ª.

Time in Africa  In 1957, Zobel, driven by his desire to know Africa, used his relationships with some Senegalese friends in Paris to find a way into the continent. He was recruited to become a college director by the Senegalese Minister of Education, Amadou Matar M‚Äôbow, as a college director at school of Ziguinchor (at present the Lyc√©e Djignabo) in Casamance. After a few years as a general supervisor of the Van Vollenhoven school in Dakar, he became a producer of educational and cultural programs at the Radio of Senegal. His programs were heard throughout French-speaking West Africa. Some anecdotes of his experiences in Dakar are recounted in the collections of short stories Mas Badara (1983) and Et si la mer n‚Äô√©tait pas bleue (1982).‚ÄúL'√©crivain Joseph Zobel est mort‚Äù, L'Obs, 19 June 2006.

Joseph Zobel, artisan du Temps‚Äù, sur potomitan.info, site de promotion des cultures et des langues cr√©oles.  Works  His most famous novel, La Rue Cases-N√®gres (often translated as Black Shack Alley or Sugar Cane Alley), was published in Paris 1950. The novel is an account of a young boy raised by his grandmother in a post-slavery - but still plantation- based - Martinique. The struggles of the impoverished cane-sugar plantation workers, and the ambitions of a loving grandmother who works hard to put the main character through school are the core focus of the novel, which also describes life in a colonial society. Zobel stated that the novel was his version of Richard Wright's Black Boy (1945) in that they are both semi- autobiographical. The novel was adapted for the screen by Euzhan Palcy in 1983 as Sugar Cane Alley. While La Rue Cases-N√®gres is Zobel's most renowned work, the author started his writing career in 1942 during World War Two with Diab- la (a tentative English title could be \\"The Devil's Garden\\"), a socially conscious novel similar to Jacques Roumain's Masters of the Dew (published a year or more later). With Diab-la, Zobel tells the powerful story of a sugar- cane plantation worker freeing himself from colonial exploitation by creating a garden in a fishermen's village of Southern Martinique. Leaving Martinique in 1946 to pursue ethnology and drama studies in Paris, Zobel spent some years in Paris and Fontainebleau, before relocating to Senegal by 1957. Writing a few short stories, he had a notable impact in the cultural life of French- speaking West Africa as a public radio producer. A noted poet and a gifted sculptor as well as a writer, Zobel retired to a small village in southern France in 1974 and died in 2006.

NiTro-VLB was a computer system that used a QED R4600 microprocessor implemented on a VESA Local Bus peripheral card and designed to function when connected to a host computer system using an Intel i486. The NiTro-VLB conformed to the ARC standard, and was produced and marketed by ShaBLAMM! Computer as an \\"upgrade\\" card for accelerating Windows NT. Characteristics The NiTro-VLB is notable for various unique characteristics among personal computer accessories. For example, although the system was marketed as an \\"upgrade\\" for computers already using a 486 processor, the NiTro-VLB was in fact of an entirely different architecture (specifically, the MIPS architecture) from the IA32-based 486. Further, as a \\"parasitic\\" or \\"symbiotic\\" coprocessor, the NiTro-VLB was designed to co-opt the host 486 processor from running, and used four megabytes of the host 486 motherboard's system memory as a DMA buffer (although the NiTro-VLB required its own separate DRAM main memory, in addition to any memory installed on the host 486 motherboard). This is a type of \\"parasite\\"/\\"host\\" upgrade card configuration, in which an entire motherboard and processor are implemented on an expansion card designed to connect to a host motherboard's expansion slot. Such configurations are rare among computer systems designed to run Microsoft Windows. Specifications and benchmarks The NiTro-VLB's QED R4600 processor, running at 100 MHz, was rated at 73.8 SPECint92 and 63 SPECfp92 (which are similar figures to the first-generation Pentium running at 66 MHz). Faster and costlier versions were designed to run at 133 MHz or 150 MHz. Sales Initially, the NiTro-VLB system was priced at $1,095 for a 100 MHz card with no main memory, $1,995 for a 100 MHz card with 16 MB of main memory and a copy of Windows NT, and $2,595 for a 150 MHz card.

Located in the Arctic Ocean, close to Bathurst Island, it has an area of , long and wide. √éle Vanier lies immediately to the south, across the Arnott Strait.  Commercial oil production  Cameron Island is notable as being the only site which has been developed for commercial oil production in the Canadian Arctic islands. From 1985 to 1996 the double-hulled tanker M.V.Arctic shipped the light crude from Bent Horn in the south-west of the island to Montreal. A total of was produced until the field was abandoned in 1996. The initial discovery, in 1974 by Panarctic Oils Ltd, reflected the urgency to find new sources of crude oil after the 1973 oil crisis. The abandonment in 1996 reflects the difficulties of exploiting the resource in this harsh environment, although the current production licence (held by Canada Southern Petroleum Ltd) expires in 2010 and could be extended. After abandonment, final clean-up occurred in 1999. Cameron Island is a desolate spot: a dark-hued landscape of low hills. Oil exploration and traffic on land were concentrated in the winter months, when \\"winter roads\\" of compacted snow across the tundra were used by heavy vehicles. Appropriate efforts were taken to minimise the damage to this fragile environment, but where the vegetation was damaged, increased depths of summer thaw occurred. Possibly the greatest concern was caused by the sumps at the well-sites, into which the toxic drilling muds were pumped. These basins, blasted out of the permafrost, relied on the gradual freeze-back of the ground to seal in the waste materials. Cameron Island was named in 1952 after Maxwell George Cameron (d.1951), the chief cartographer of the surveys and mapping branch, Department of Mines and Technical Surveys.

Ammann‚ÄìBeenker tiling Ammann attended Brandeis University, but generally did not go to classes, and left after three years. He worked as a programmer for Honeywell. After ten years, his position was eliminated as part of a routine cutback, and Ammann ended up working as a mail sorter for a post office. In 1975, Ammann read an announcement by Martin Gardner of new work by Roger Penrose. Penrose had discovered two simple sets of aperiodic tiles, each consisting of just two quadrilaterals. Since Penrose was taking out a patent, he wasn't ready to publish them, and Gardner's description was rather vague. Ammann wrote a letter to Gardner, describing his own work, which duplicated one of Penrose's sets, plus a foursome of \\"golden rhombohedra\\" that formed aperiodic tilings in space.\\"The Mysterious Mr. Ammann\\" The Mathematical Intelligencer, September 2004, Volume 26, Issue 4, pp 10‚Äì21 More letters followed, and Ammann became a correspondent with many of the professional researchers. He discovered several new aperiodic tilings, each among the simplest known examples of aperiodic sets of tiles. He also showed how to generate tilings using lines in the plane as guides for lines marked on the tiles, now called \\"Ammann bars\\". The discovery of quasicrystals in 1982 changed the status of aperiodic tilings and Ammann's work from mere recreational mathematics to respectable academic research. After more than ten years of coaxing, he agreed to meet various professionals in person, and eventually even went to two conferences and delivered a lecture at each. Afterwards, Ammann dropped out of sight, and died of a heart attack a few years later. News of his death did not reach the research community for a few more years. Five sets of tiles discovered by Ammann were described in Tilings and PatternsB. Gr√ºnbaum and G.C. Shephard, Tilings and Patterns, Freemann, NY 1986 and later, in collaboration with the authors of the book, he published a paperR.Ammann, B. Gr√ºnbaum and G.C. Shephard, Aperiodic Tiles, Discrete Comput Geom 8 (1992),1‚Äì25 proving the aperiodicity for four of them. Ammann's discoveries came to notice only after Penrose had published his own discovery and gained priority. In 1981 de Bruijn exposed the cut and project method and in 1984 came the sensational news about Shechtman quasicrystals which promoted the Penrose tiling to fame. But in 1982 Beenker published a similar mathematical explanation for the octagonal case which became known as the Ammann‚ÄìBeenker tiling.Beenker FPM, \\"Algebraic theory of non periodic tilings of the plane by two simple building blocks: a square and a rhombus\\", TH Report 82-WSK-04 (1982), Technische Hogeschool, Eindhoven In 1987 Wang, Chen and Kuo announced the discovery of a quasicrystal with octagonal symmetry. The decagonal covering of the Penrose tiling was proposed in 1996 and two years later F. Gahler proposed an octagonal variant for the Ammann‚ÄìBeenker tilingS. Ben Abraham and F. Gahler, Phys. Rev. B 60(1999)860 Ammann's name became that of the perennial second. It is acknowledged however that Robert Ammann first proposed the construction of rhombic prisms which is the three-dimensional model of Shechtman's quasicrystals.

The grid divides the surface of the Earth along meridians and parallels, and simulates the thickness of the atmosphere by stacking grid cells away from the Earth's center. An inset shows the different physical processes analyzed in each grid cell, such as advection, precipitation, solar radiation, and terrestrial radiative cooling. Numerical weather prediction (NWP) uses mathematical models of the atmosphere and oceans to predict the weather based on current weather conditions. Though first attempted in the 1920s, it was not until the advent of computer simulation in the 1950s that numerical weather predictions produced realistic results. A number of global and regional forecast models are run in different countries worldwide, using current weather observations relayed from radiosondes, weather satellites and other observing systems as inputs. Mathematical models based on the same physical principles can be used to generate either short-term weather forecasts or longer-term climate predictions; the latter are widely applied for understanding and projecting climate change. The improvements made to regional models have allowed for significant improvements in tropical cyclone track and air quality forecasts; however, atmospheric models perform poorly at handling processes that occur in a relatively constricted area, such as wildfires. Manipulating the vast datasets and performing the complex calculations necessary to modern numerical weather prediction requires some of the most powerful supercomputers in the world. Even with the increasing power of supercomputers, the forecast skill of numerical weather models extends to only about six days. Factors affecting the accuracy of numerical predictions include the density and quality of observations used as input to the forecasts, along with deficiencies in the numerical models themselves. Post- processing techniques such as model output statistics (MOS) have been developed to improve the handling of errors in numerical predictions. A more fundamental problem lies in the chaotic nature of the partial differential equations that govern the atmosphere. It is impossible to solve these equations exactly, and small errors grow with time (doubling about every five days). Present understanding is that this chaotic behavior limits accurate forecasts to about 14 days even with accurate input data and a flawless model. In addition, the partial differential equations used in the model need to be supplemented with parameterizations for solar radiation, moist processes (clouds and precipitation), heat exchange, soil, vegetation, surface water, and the effects of terrain. In an effort to quantify the large amount of inherent uncertainty remaining in numerical predictions, ensemble forecasts have been used since the 1990s to help gauge the confidence in the forecast, and to obtain useful results farther into the future than otherwise possible. This approach analyzes multiple forecasts created with an individual forecast model or multiple models.  History  The ENIAC main control panel at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering operated by Betty Jennings and Frances Bilas. The history of numerical weather prediction began in the 1920s through the efforts of Lewis Fry Richardson, who used procedures originally developed by Vilhelm Bjerknes to produce by hand a six-hour forecast for the state of the atmosphere over two points in central Europe, taking at least six weeks to do so. It was not until the advent of the computer and computer simulations that computation time was reduced to less than the forecast period itself. The ENIAC was used to create the first weather forecasts via computer in 1950, based on a highly simplified approximation to the atmospheric governing equations. In 1954, Carl-Gustav Rossby's group at the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute used the same model to produce the first operational forecast (i.e., a routine prediction for practical use). Operational numerical weather prediction in the United States began in 1955 under the Joint Numerical Weather Prediction Unit (JNWPU), a joint project by the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Weather Bureau. In 1956, Norman Phillips developed a mathematical model which could realistically depict monthly and seasonal patterns in the troposphere; this became the first successful climate model. Following Phillips' work, several groups began working to create general circulation models. The first general circulation climate model that combined both oceanic and atmospheric processes was developed in the late 1960s at the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. As computers have become more powerful, the size of the initial data sets has increased and newer atmospheric models have been developed to take advantage of the added available computing power. These newer models include more physical processes in the simplifications of the equations of motion in numerical simulations of the atmosphere. In 1966, West Germany and the United States began producing operational forecasts based on primitive-equation models, followed by the United Kingdom in 1972 and Australia in 1977. The development of limited area (regional) models facilitated advances in forecasting the tracks of tropical cyclones as well as air quality in the 1970s and 1980s. By the early 1980s models began to include the interactions of soil and vegetation with the atmosphere, which led to more realistic forecasts. The output of forecast models based on atmospheric dynamics is unable to resolve some details of the weather near the Earth's surface. As such, a statistical relationship between the output of a numerical weather model and the ensuing conditions at the ground was developed in the 1970s and 1980s, known as model output statistics (MOS). Starting in the 1990s, model ensemble forecasts have been used to help define the forecast uncertainty and to extend the window in which numerical weather forecasting is viable farther into the future than otherwise possible. Initialization Weather reconnaissance aircraft, such as this alt=A WP-3D Orion weather reconnaissance aircraft in flight. The atmosphere is a fluid. As such, the idea of numerical weather prediction is to sample the state of the fluid at a given time and use the equations of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics to estimate the state of the fluid at some time in the future. The process of entering observation data into the model to generate initial conditions is called initialization. On land, terrain maps available at resolutions down to globally are used to help model atmospheric circulations within regions of rugged topography, in order to better depict features such as downslope winds, mountain waves and related cloudiness that affects incoming solar radiation. The main inputs from country-based weather services are observations from devices (called radiosondes) in weather balloons that measure various atmospheric parameters and transmits them to a fixed receiver, as well as from weather satellites. The World Meteorological Organization acts to standardize the instrumentation, observing practices and timing of these observations worldwide. Stations either report hourly in METAR reports, or every six hours in SYNOP reports. These observations are irregularly spaced, so they are processed by data assimilation and objective analysis methods, which perform quality control and obtain values at locations usable by the model's mathematical algorithms. The data are then used in the model as the starting point for a forecast. A variety of methods are used to gather observational data for use in numerical models. Sites launch radiosondes in weather balloons which rise through the troposphere and well into the stratosphere. Information from weather satellites is used where traditional data sources are not available. Commerce provides pilot reports along aircraft routes and ship reports along shipping routes. Research projects use reconnaissance aircraft to fly in and around weather systems of interest, such as tropical cyclones. Reconnaissance aircraft are also flown over the open oceans during the cold season into systems which cause significant uncertainty in forecast guidance, or are expected to be of high impact from three to seven days into the future over the downstream continent. Sea ice began to be initialized in forecast models in 1971. Efforts to involve sea surface temperature in model initialization began in 1972 due to its role in modulating weather in higher latitudes of the Pacific. Computation A alt=A prognostic chart of the North American continent provides geopotential heights, temperatures, and wind velocities at regular intervals. The values are taken at the altitude corresponding to the 850-millibar pressure surface. An atmospheric model is a computer program that produces meteorological information for future times at given locations and altitudes. Within any modern model is a set of equations, known as the primitive equations, used to predict the future state of the atmosphere. These equations‚Äîalong with the ideal gas law‚Äîare used to evolve the density, pressure, and potential temperature scalar fields and the air velocity (wind) vector field of the atmosphere through time. Additional transport equations for pollutants and other aerosols are included in some primitive-equation high-resolution models as well. The equations used are nonlinear partial differential equations which are impossible to solve exactly through analytical methods, with the exception of a few idealized cases. Therefore, numerical methods obtain approximate solutions. Different models use different solution methods: some global models and almost all regional models use finite difference methods for all three spatial dimensions, while other global models and a few regional models use spectral methods for the horizontal dimensions and finite-difference methods in the vertical. These equations are initialized from the analysis data and rates of change are determined. These rates of change predict the state of the atmosphere a short time into the future; the time increment for this prediction is called a time step. This future atmospheric state is then used as the starting point for another application of the predictive equations to find new rates of change, and these new rates of change predict the atmosphere at a yet further time step into the future. This time stepping is repeated until the solution reaches the desired forecast time. The length of the time step chosen within the model is related to the distance between the points on the computational grid, and is chosen to maintain numerical stability. Time steps for global models are on the order of tens of minutes, while time steps for regional models are between one and four minutes. The global models are run at varying times into the future. The UKMET Unified Model is run six days into the future, while the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts' Integrated Forecast System and Environment Canada's Global Environmental Multiscale Model both run out to ten days into the future, and the Global Forecast System model run by the Environmental Modeling Center is run sixteen days into the future. The visual output produced by a model solution is known as a prognostic chart, or prog.  Parameterization  Field of cumulus clouds, which are parameterized since they are too small to be explicitly included within numerical weather prediction Some meteorological processes are too small-scale or too complex to be explicitly included in numerical weather prediction models. Parameterization is a procedure for representing these processes by relating them to variables on the scales that the model resolves. For example, the gridboxes in weather and climate models have sides that are between and in length. A typical cumulus cloud has a scale of less than , and would require a grid even finer than this to be represented physically by the equations of fluid motion. Therefore, the processes that such clouds represent are parameterized, by processes of various sophistication. In the earliest models, if a column of air within a model gridbox was conditionally unstable (essentially, the bottom was warmer and moister than the top) and the water vapor content at any point within the column became saturated then it would be overturned (the warm, moist air would begin rising), and the air in that vertical column mixed. More sophisticated schemes recognize that only some portions of the box might convect and that entrainment and other processes occur. Weather models that have gridboxes with sizes between can explicitly represent convective clouds, although they need to parameterize cloud microphysics which occur at a smaller scale. The formation of large-scale (stratus-type) clouds is more physically based; they form when the relative humidity reaches some prescribed value. Sub-grid scale processes need to be taken into account. Rather than assuming that clouds form at 100% relative humidity, the cloud fraction can be related to a critical value of relative humidity less than 100%, reflecting the sub grid scale variation that occurs in the real world. The amount of solar radiation reaching the ground, as well as the formation of cloud droplets occur on the molecular scale, and so they must be parameterized before they can be included in the model. Atmospheric drag produced by mountains must also be parameterized, as the limitations in the resolution of elevation contours produce significant underestimates of the drag. This method of parameterization is also done for the surface flux of energy between the ocean and the atmosphere, in order to determine realistic sea surface temperatures and type of sea ice found near the ocean's surface. Sun angle as well as the impact of multiple cloud layers is taken into account. Soil type, vegetation type, and soil moisture all determine how much radiation goes into warming and how much moisture is drawn up into the adjacent atmosphere, and thus it is important to parameterize their contribution to these processes. Within air quality models, parameterizations take into account atmospheric emissions from multiple relatively tiny sources (e.g. roads, fields, factories) within specific grid boxes. Domains alt=A sigma coordinate system is shown. The lines of equal sigma values follow the terrain at the bottom, and gradually smoothen towards the top of the atmosphere. The horizontal domain of a model is either global, covering the entire Earth, or regional, covering only part of the Earth. Regional models (also known as limited-area models, or LAMs) allow for the use of finer grid spacing than global models because the available computational resources are focused on a specific area instead of being spread over the globe. This allows regional models to resolve explicitly smaller-scale meteorological phenomena that cannot be represented on the coarser grid of a global model. Regional models use a global model to specify conditions at the edge of their domain (boundary conditions) in order to allow systems from outside the regional model domain to move into its area. Uncertainty and errors within regional models are introduced by the global model used for the boundary conditions of the edge of the regional model, as well as errors attributable to the regional model itself. Coordinate systems=Horizontal coordinates Horizontal position may be expressed directly in geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) for global models or in a map projection planar coordinates for regional models. The German weather service is using for its global ICON model (icosahedral non-hydrostatic global circulation model) a grid based on a regular icosahedron. Basic cells in this grid are triangles instead of the four corner cells in a traditional latitude-longitude grid. The advantage is that, different from a latitude-longitude cells are everywhere on the globe the same size. Disadvantage is that equations in this non rectangular grid are more complicated. Vertical coordinates The vertical coordinate is handled in various ways. Lewis Fry Richardson's 1922 model used geometric height (z) as the vertical coordinate. Later models substituted the geometric z coordinate with a pressure coordinate system, in which the geopotential heights of constant-pressure surfaces become dependent variables, greatly simplifying the primitive equations. This correlation between coordinate systems can be made since pressure decreases with height through the Earth's atmosphere. The first model used for operational forecasts, the single-layer barotropic model, used a single pressure coordinate at the 500-millibar (about ) level, and thus was essentially two-dimensional. High-resolution models‚Äîalso called mesoscale models‚Äîsuch as the Weather Research and Forecasting model tend to use normalized pressure coordinates referred to as sigma coordinates. This coordinate system receives its name from the independent variable \\\\sigma used to scale atmospheric pressures with respect to the pressure at the surface, and in some cases also with the pressure at the top of the domain. Model output statistics Because forecast models based upon the equations for atmospheric dynamics do not perfectly determine weather conditions, statistical methods have been developed to attempt to correct the forecasts. Statistical models were created based upon the three-dimensional fields produced by numerical weather models, surface observations and the climatological conditions for specific locations. These statistical models are collectively referred to as model output statistics (MOS), and were developed by the National Weather Service for their suite of weather forecasting models in the late 1960s. Model output statistics differ from the perfect prog technique, which assumes that the output of numerical weather prediction guidance is perfect. MOS can correct for local effects that cannot be resolved by the model due to insufficient grid resolution, as well as model biases. Because MOS is run after its respective global or regional model, its production is known as post-processing. Forecast parameters within MOS include maximum and minimum temperatures, percentage chance of rain within a several hour period, precipitation amount expected, chance that the precipitation will be frozen in nature, chance for thunderstorms, cloudiness, and surface winds. Ensembles alt=Two images are shown. The top image provides three potential tracks that could have been taken by Hurricane Rita. Contours over the coast of Texas correspond to the sea-level air pressure predicted as the storm passed. The bottom image shows an ensemble of track forecasts produced by different weather models for the same hurricane. In 1963, Edward Lorenz discovered the chaotic nature of the fluid dynamics equations involved in weather forecasting. Extremely small errors in temperature, winds, or other initial inputs given to numerical models will amplify and double every five days, making it impossible for long-range forecasts‚Äîthose made more than two weeks in advance‚Äîto predict the state of the atmosphere with any degree of forecast skill. Furthermore, existing observation networks have poor coverage in some regions (for example, over large bodies of water such as the Pacific Ocean), which introduces uncertainty into the true initial state of the atmosphere. While a set of equations, known as the Liouville equations, exists to determine the initial uncertainty in the model initialization, the equations are too complex to run in real-time, even with the use of supercomputers. These uncertainties limit forecast model accuracy to about five or six days into the future. Edward Epstein recognized in 1969 that the atmosphere could not be completely described with a single forecast run due to inherent uncertainty, and proposed using an ensemble of stochastic Monte Carlo simulations to produce means and variances for the state of the atmosphere. Although this early example of an ensemble showed skill, in 1974 Cecil Leith showed that they produced adequate forecasts only when the ensemble probability distribution was a representative sample of the probability distribution in the atmosphere. Since the 1990s, ensemble forecasts have been used operationally (as routine forecasts) to account for the stochastic nature of weather processes - that is, to resolve their inherent uncertainty. This method involves analyzing multiple forecasts created with an individual forecast model by using different physical parametrizations or varying initial conditions. Starting in 1992 with ensemble forecasts prepared by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction, model ensemble forecasts have been used to help define the forecast uncertainty and to extend the window in which numerical weather forecasting is viable farther into the future than otherwise possible. The ECMWF model, the Ensemble Prediction System, uses singular vectors to simulate the initial probability density, while the NCEP ensemble, the Global Ensemble Forecasting System, uses a technique known as vector breeding. The UK Met Office runs global and regional ensemble forecasts where perturbations to initial conditions are produced using a Kalman filter. There are 24 ensemble members in the Met Office Global and Regional Ensemble Prediction System (MOGREPS). In a single model-based approach, the ensemble forecast is usually evaluated in terms of an average of the individual forecasts concerning one forecast variable, as well as the degree of agreement between various forecasts within the ensemble system, as represented by their overall spread. Ensemble spread is diagnosed through tools such as spaghetti diagrams, which show the dispersion of one quantity on prognostic charts for specific time steps in the future. Another tool where ensemble spread is used is a meteogram, which shows the dispersion in the forecast of one quantity for one specific location. It is common for the ensemble spread to be too small to include the weather that actually occurs, which can lead to forecasters misdiagnosing model uncertainty; this problem becomes particularly severe for forecasts of the weather about ten days in advance. When ensemble spread is small and the forecast solutions are consistent within multiple model runs, forecasters perceive more confidence in the ensemble mean, and the forecast in general. Despite this perception, a spread-skill relationship is often weak or not found, as spread-error correlations are normally less than 0.6, and only under special circumstances range between 0.6-0.7. The relationship between ensemble spread and forecast skill varies substantially depending on such factors as the forecast model and the region for which the forecast is made. In the same way that many forecasts from a single model can be used to form an ensemble, multiple models may also be combined to produce an ensemble forecast. This approach is called multi-model ensemble forecasting, and it has been shown to improve forecasts when compared to a single model-based approach. Models within a multi-model ensemble can be adjusted for their various biases, which is a process known as superensemble forecasting. This type of forecast significantly reduces errors in model output.  Applications =Air quality modeling Air quality forecasting attempts to predict when the concentrations of pollutants will attain levels that are hazardous to public health. The concentration of pollutants in the atmosphere is determined by their transport, or mean velocity of movement through the atmosphere, their diffusion, chemical transformation, and ground deposition. In addition to pollutant source and terrain information, these models require data about the state of the fluid flow in the atmosphere to determine its transport and diffusion. Meteorological conditions such as thermal inversions can prevent surface air from rising, trapping pollutants near the surface, which makes accurate forecasts of such events crucial for air quality modeling. Urban air quality models require a very fine computational mesh, requiring the use of high-resolution mesoscale weather models; in spite of this, the quality of numerical weather guidance is the main uncertainty in air quality forecasts. Climate modeling A General Circulation Model (GCM) is a mathematical model that can be used in computer simulations of the global circulation of a planetary atmosphere or ocean. An atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) is essentially the same as a global numerical weather prediction model, and some (such as the one used in the UK Unified Model) can be configured for both short-term weather forecasts and longer-term climate predictions. Along with sea ice and land-surface components, AGCMs and oceanic GCMs (OGCM) are key components of global climate models, and are widely applied for understanding the climate and projecting climate change. For aspects of climate change, a range of man-made chemical emission scenarios can be fed into the climate models to see how an enhanced greenhouse effect would modify the Earth's climate. Versions designed for climate applications with time scales of decades to centuries were originally created in 1969 by Syukuro Manabe and Kirk Bryan at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, New Jersey. When run for multiple decades, computational limitations mean that the models must use a coarse grid that leaves smaller-scale interactions unresolved. Ocean surface modeling alt=A wind and wave forecast for the North Atlantic Ocean. Two areas of high waves are identified: One west of the southern tip of Greenland, and the other in the North Sea. Calm seas are forecast for the Gulf of Mexico. Wind barbs show the expected wind strengths and directions at regularly spaced intervals over the North Atlantic. The transfer of energy between the wind blowing over the surface of an ocean and the ocean's upper layer is an important element in wave dynamics. The spectral wave transport equation is used to describe the change in wave spectrum over changing topography. It simulates wave generation, wave movement (propagation within a fluid), wave shoaling, refraction, energy transfer between waves, and wave dissipation. Since surface winds are the primary forcing mechanism in the spectral wave transport equation, ocean wave models use information produced by numerical weather prediction models as inputs to determine how much energy is transferred from the atmosphere into the layer at the surface of the ocean. Along with dissipation of energy through whitecaps and resonance between waves, surface winds from numerical weather models allow for more accurate predictions of the state of the sea surface. Tropical cyclone forecasting Tropical cyclone forecasting also relies on data provided by numerical weather models. Three main classes of tropical cyclone guidance models exist: Statistical models are based on an analysis of storm behavior using climatology, and correlate a storm's position and date to produce a forecast that is not based on the physics of the atmosphere at the time. Dynamical models are numerical models that solve the governing equations of fluid flow in the atmosphere; they are based on the same principles as other limited-area numerical weather prediction models but may include special computational techniques such as refined spatial domains that move along with the cyclone. Models that use elements of both approaches are called statistical-dynamical models. In 1978, the first hurricane-tracking model based on atmospheric dynamics‚Äîthe movable fine-mesh (MFM) model‚Äîbegan operating. Within the field of tropical cyclone track forecasting, despite the ever-improving dynamical model guidance which occurred with increased computational power, it was not until the 1980s when numerical weather prediction showed skill, and until the 1990s when it consistently outperformed statistical or simple dynamical models. Predictions of the intensity of a tropical cyclone based on numerical weather prediction continue to be a challenge, since statistical methods continue to show higher skill over dynamical guidance. Wildfire modeling A simple wildfire propagation model On a molecular scale, there are two main competing reaction processes involved in the degradation of cellulose, or wood fuels, in wildfires. When there is a low amount of moisture in a cellulose fiber, volatilization of the fuel occurs; this process will generate intermediate gaseous products that will ultimately be the source of combustion. When moisture is present‚Äîor when enough heat is being carried away from the fiber, charring occurs. The chemical kinetics of both reactions indicate that there is a point at which the level of moisture is low enough‚Äîand/or heating rates high enough‚Äîfor combustion processes become self-sufficient. Consequently, changes in wind speed, direction, moisture, temperature, or lapse rate at different levels of the atmosphere can have a significant impact on the behavior and growth of a wildfire. Since the wildfire acts as a heat source to the atmospheric flow, the wildfire can modify local advection patterns, introducing a feedback loop between the fire and the atmosphere. A simplified two-dimensional model for the spread of wildfires that used convection to represent the effects of wind and terrain, as well as radiative heat transfer as the dominant method of heat transport led to reaction-diffusion systems of partial differential equations. More complex models join numerical weather models or computational fluid dynamics models with a wildfire component which allow the feedback effects between the fire and the atmosphere to be estimated. The additional complexity in the latter class of models translates to a corresponding increase in their computer power requirements. In fact, a full three-dimensional treatment of combustion via direct numerical simulation at scales relevant for atmospheric modeling is not currently practical because of the excessive computational cost such a simulation would require. Numerical weather models have limited forecast skill at spatial resolutions under , forcing complex wildfire models to parameterize the fire in order to calculate how the winds will be modified locally by the wildfire, and to use those modified winds to determine the rate at which the fire will spread locally. Although models such as Los Alamos' FIRETEC solve for the concentrations of fuel and oxygen, the computational grid cannot be fine enough to resolve the combustion reaction, so approximations must be made for the temperature distribution within each grid cell, as well as for the combustion reaction rates themselves.

The digital component normally serves as the controller and provides logical and numerical operations, while the analog component often serves as a solver of differential equations and other mathematically complex equations. The first desktop hybrid computing system was the Hycomp 250, released by Packard Bell in 1961. Another early example was the HYDAC 2400, an integrated hybrid computer released by EAI in 1963. In the 1980s, Marconi Space and Defense Systems Limited (under Peggy Hodges) developed their \\"Starglow Hybrid Computer\\", which consisted of three EAI 8812 analog computers linked to an EAI 8100 digital computer, the latter also being linked to an SEL 3200 digital computer. Late in the 20th century, hybrids dwindled with the increasing capabilities of digital computers including digital signal processors.The Analogue Alternative, the Electronic Analog Computer in Britain and the USA, 1930-1975, by James S Small In general, analog computers are extraordinarily fast, since they are able to solve most mathematically complex equations at the rate at which a signal traverses the circuit, which is generally an appreciable fraction of the speed of light. On the other hand, the precision of analog computers is not good; they are limited to three, or at most, four digits of precision. Digital computers can be built to take the solution of equations to almost unlimited precision, but quite slowly compared to analog computers. Generally, complex mathematical equations are approximated using iterative methods which take huge numbers of iterations, depending on how good the initial \\"guess\\" at the final value is and how much precision is desired. (This initial guess is known as the numerical \\"seed\\".) For many real-time operations in the 20th century, such digital calculations were too slow to be of much use (e.g., for very high frequency phased array radars or for weather calculations), but the precision of an analog computer is insufficient. Hybrid computers can be used to obtain a very good but relatively imprecise 'seed' value, using an analog computer front-end, which is then fed into a digital computer iterative process to achieve the final desired degree of precision. With a three or four digit, highly accurate numerical seed, the total digital computation time to reach the desired precision is dramatically reduced, since many fewer iterations are required. One of the main technical problems to be overcome in hybrid computers is minimizing digital-computer noise in analog computing elements and grounding systems. Consider that the nervous system in animals is a form of hybrid computer. Signals pass across the synapses from one nerve cell to the next as discrete (digital) packets of chemicals, which are then summed within the nerve cell in an analog fashion by building an electro-chemical potential until its threshold is reached, whereupon it discharges and sends out a series of digital packets to the next nerve cell. The advantages are at least threefold: noise within the system is minimized (and tends not to be additive), no common grounding system is required, and there is minimal degradation of the signal even if there are substantial differences in activity of the cells along a path (only the signal delays tend to vary). The individual nerve cells are analogous to analog computers; the synapses are analogous to digital computers. Hybrid computers should be distinguished from hybrid systems. The latter may be no more than a digital computer equipped with an analog-to-digital converter at the input and/or a digital-to-analog converter at the output, to convert analog signals for ordinary digital signal processing, and conversely, e.g., for driving physical control systems, such as servomechanisms.  VLSI hybrid computer chip  In 2015, researchers at Columbia University published a paper on a small scale hybrid computer in 65 nm CMOS technology.

It is the seat of both Dengu√©l√© District and Kabadougou Region. It is also a commune and the seat of and a sub-prefecture of Odienn√© Department. The town of Odienn√© was founded by Malink√© people under Vakaba Tour√©. Later, Samory Tour√© founded a support base in the town. Features of Odienn√© include a large mosque and nearby gold mines. Vakaba Tour√©'s tomb is located in Odienn√© also. The town is served by Odienn√© Airport. The Stade Municipal is a multi-purpose stadium in the town. St. Augustine Cathedral serves as the cathedral and headquarters for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Odienn√©, of which Antoine Kon√© is the bishop. History It is thought that the area surrounding Odienn√© was first settled by the Senufo people and the Mandinka people. The founding of the town is credited to Vakaba Tour√© (1800‚Äì58), who also founded the Kabadougou Empire, of which Odienn√© was the capital. The French explorer Ren√© Cailli√© visited Odienn√© in 1827. In 1898, during the French occupation of Cote d'Ivoire, a military post was established south of Odienn√©. During the First Ivorian Civil War, Odienn√© was a Forces Nouvelles de C√¥te d'Ivoire stronghold. Its remote location meant that the town was somewhat peaceful during the war compared to other Ivorian towns. Economy Odienn√© relies on agriculture as its main industry. Fruits, cashews, yams, and cotton is grown in fields located in the Massif du Diengu√©l√© valley. The town houses a rice-processing plant and manganese is also produced in the area.

Trees may be set aside as a carving resource; or flax bushes for the weaving of a special cloak for a chief. Areas may be placed under rƒÅhui requiring them to be left to lie fallow so that the resources may regenerate. The custom of rƒÅhui is still used today, and it has similarities to the bans imposed by the present day legal system on the gathering of food resources for conservation purposes; however MƒÅori often perceive such bans on the gathering of traditional resources such as shellfish and native birds as 'another denial of their customary rights.' A sign or physical symbol may be displayed to show that a rƒÅhui has been imposed. Sometimes a carved or decorated wooden stick or post may be placed in the ground. Natural features of the landscape can indicate the boundaries of the area that is under restriction. Additionally, people will be informed about the placing of the rƒÅhui.

His history of unlicensed broadcasting in the service of social and racial justice has made him \\"an early hero of the micro-broadcasting movement.\\" Brief biography=Mail order kit During the 1980s, Mbanna Kantako had been living in a public housing project in Springfield, Illinois. With the help of Mike Townsend, a professor of social work at a small college in Springfield, Mbanna Kantako obtained a 1 watt transmitter kit from a mail order catalog. Housing Project Tenants' Association Having constructed the transmitter, Mbanna used to communicate with other Black residents in the housing project under the call letters WTRA (\\"Tenants Rights Association\\"), of which he was a member. These transmissions went through more changes of name from Black Liberation Radio to African Liberation Radio. Fine Mbanna Kantako found himself under investigation by the FCC when his microwatt transmissions expanded in both duration and content by featuring youths who were in trouble with the Housing Project police. Then he was ordered to cease his broadcasts. Like a lot of pirate radio broadcasters at first he complied and then came back on the airwaves. However, he announced his return by informing the FCC of his intention by means of a public announcement to the press. The net result was a summons to appear in court where he faced a $750 fine. Kantako claimed that he could not get a court-appointed lawyer and so he refused to go to court and as a result a default judgment was entered against him. Inspirational anarchy His press conference inspired others to also start microwatt stations in other cities. Radio Free Detroit took to the air and it was promptly raided by the FCC. But in short order it was followed by Free Radio Berkeley and then San Francisco Liberation Radio. Kantako also returned to the air from 7pm to midnight every day. His reasoning is exactly the same as Alan Weiner who started Radio Newyork International after first operating both licensed and unlicensed commercial radio stations on land in the New York City area. Kantako claims that he should be left alone because he is just using an open space on the spectrum.

It traditionally takes place in the principal government building of a country, state, or city. While the practice differs among countries, a viewing in a location other than the principal government building may be referred to as lying in repose. Canada In Canada, official lying in state is a part of a state funeral, an honor generally reserved for former Governors General and former Prime Ministers. It is held in the Centre Block of Parliament Hill, in the national capital, Ottawa, Ontario. Ex- governors general lie in state in the Senate Chamber while former prime ministers lie in the Hall of Honour. During the period of lying in state, the caskets are flanked at each corner by a Guard of honour, composed of four members drawn from the Canadian Forces and Royal Canadian Mounted Police, as well as members of the Governor General's Foot Guards for former governors general, and guards from the parliamentary security forces for former prime ministers. Guards stand at each corner with heads bowed and weapons inverted (resting on Arms reversed) with their backs turned towards the casket. Provinces may also mount state funerals and have a lying in state for a distinguished former resident. For instance, Maurice Richard, nationally known hockey player, was given a state funeral by the province of Quebec when he died in 2000; his coffin lay in state at the Molson Centre. This process was repeated for fellow Canadiens player Jean B√©liveau in December 2014. Upon his death in October 2012, 24th Lieutenant Governor of Ontario and former member of parliament Lincoln Alexander received only the second provincial state funeral in the province. Ontario staged its first state funeral in October 1982 for former Premier John Robarts. Alexander laid in state in the Ontario Legislative Building in Toronto then in repose in Hamilton City Hall, his hometown. The service was held in Hamilton Place. During the procession from city hall, the casket was escorted by mounted police officers, marching police, firefighters and military and a massed pipe band representing several police and fire services. On 2 July 2019, Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan W. Thomas Molloy died. He was installed as the 22nd Lieutenant Governor on 21 March 2018, and approximately a year later, diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. His state funeral service was held at Merlis Belsher Place on the campus of the University of Saskatchewan. Malloy had earlier served as Chancellor of the university. Members of the public were able to sign books of condolence at the Saskatchewan Legislative Building and Government House in Regina and city hall in Saskatoon. Premier Scott Moe stated that flags in the province would fly at half-mast until sunset on the day of Malloy's funeral, which was later scheduled for July 13. During the service, a detail of Royal Canadian Mounted Police guarded the casket and following, members of 15 Wing Moose Jaw from the Royal Canadian Air Force flew over Merlis Belsher Place. Jocelyne Roy- Vienneau, Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick, died 2 August 2019, after holding office since 23 October 2014. She received a state funeral 8 August 2019 and the flag on the Peace Tower of the Parliament Buildings flew at half- mast from 6 August through 8 August. Municipalities may offer civic funerals to prominent deceased current or former politicians. North Korea In North Korea, the body of the late leader Kim Jong-il was displayed in a glass coffin surrounded with red flowers at the Kumsusan Memorial Palace in Pyongyang prior to his funeral, which began and ended at the palace. An honor guard armed with AK-47s was present. Jong-il's father Kim Il-sung, the founding president, is on display elsewhere in the palace. Russia In Russia, during the time of the Soviet Union (1917‚Äì1991), the state funerals of the most senior political and military leaders, such as Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, Leonid Brezhnev, Yuri Andropov, and Konstantin Chernenko all followed the same basic outline. They took place in Moscow, beginning with a public lying in state of the deceased in the House of the Unions, and ending with an interment at Red Square. For the lying in state at the House of the Unions, the coffin would be placed on display in the Column Hall, which would be decorated by flowers, numerous red flags and other communist symbols. The mourners, which usually would be brought in by the thousands, shuffled up a marble staircase beneath chandeliers draped in black gauze. On the stage at the left side of the Column Hall, a full orchestra in black tailcoats played classical music. The deceased's embalmed body, dressed in a black suit, white shirt and a tie, was displayed in an open coffin on a catafalque banked with carnations, red roses and tulips, facing the queue of mourners. A small guard of honour would be in attendance in the background. At the right side of the hall, seats were placed for guests of honour, with the front row reserved for the dead leader's family. On the day of the funeral, a military funeral parade would take place during which the coffin would be conveyed from the House of the Unions to Red Square where burial would take place. Lenin and Stalin were placed inside the Lenin Mausoleum, while Brezhnev, Andropov, and Chernenko were interred in individual graves in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis. Singapore At state funerals in Singapore, the national flag is put on the coffin. The vigil guard may be deployed during the public lying in state of the deceased person at Parliament House. The deployment of the vigil guard is the highest form of respect accorded by the nation to the deceased. Similar to British traditions, the vigil guard is composed of groups of five commissioned officers from the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and Singapore Police Force (SPF) who stand guard around the clock in shifts of 30 minutes. One of the five officers stands facing outward at each of the four corners of the casket, while the fifth and most senior one stands in front and faces inward. Their heads are bowed and their ceremonial swords are inverted. Vigil guards were stationed at the public lying in state of Goh Keng Swee in May 2010, Lee Kuan Yew in March 2015 as well as S R Nathan in August 2016. South Africa Nelson Mandela was the first democratically elected president to lie in state in South Africa. The event took place at the Union Buildings, the same site where he was inaugurated as the President of South Africa on May 10, 1994. The body of Mandela was lying in State for three days, starting on Wednesday, 11 December 2013 and ending Friday, 13 December. The body was viewed by thousands of South Africans before it was airlifted to Qunu in the Eastern Cape where Mandela was buried on 15 December 2013. United Kingdom The lying-in-state of King Edward VII in Westminster Hall, May 1910. In state and ceremonial funerals in the United Kingdom, the lying-in-state takes place in Westminster Hall. The coffin is placed on a catafalque and is guarded, around the clock, by detachments, each of four men, from the following units: * Sovereign's Bodyguard ** Her Majesty's Bodyguard of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at- Arms ** The Queen's Bodyguard of the Yeomen of the Guard ** The Royal Company of Archers, The Queen's Bodyguard for Scotland * Household Cavalry ** The Life Guards ** The Blues and Royals (Royal Horse Guards and 1st Dragoons) * Foot Guards ** Grenadier Guards ** Coldstream Guards ** Scots Guards ** Irish Guards ** Welsh Guards Each unit mans the guard for a total of six hours, with each detachment standing post for twenty minutes. The four men stand at each corner with heads bowed and weapons inverted; their backs are turned towards the coffin. On two occasions, the guard has been mounted by four male members of the Royal Family. At the lying in state of King George V in 1936, the guard was mounted by his four sons King Edward VIII, the Duke of York (George VI), the Duke of Gloucester and the Duke of Kent. For Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother's lying-in-state in 2002, the guard was mounted by her four grandsons, the Prince of Wales, the Duke of York, the Earl of Wessex, and Viscount Linley. The first British monarch to lie-in-state at Westminster Hall was King Edward VII in 1910, apparently inspired by William Gladstone who had lain-in- state in the hall in 1898. United States President Ronald Reagan lies in state at the United States Capitol rotunda, June 2004. Lying in state in the United States is the rare honor either authorized by a congressional resolution or approved by the congressional leadership, when permission is granted by survivors, to a deceased member of government (or former member) whereby his or her remains are placed in the rotunda of the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. for public viewing. The casket is guarded by members of the armed forces. By regulation and custom, only Presidents, military commanders, Justices of the Supreme Court, and members of Congress are granted the honor of lying in state. In 2020, Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg became the first woman and Jewish person to lie in state in the United States Capitol. The casket of Rosa Parks at the U.S. Capitol rotunda It differs from lying in honor in that individuals lying in state have five guards of honor, representing the five branches of the U.S. Armed Forces, while individuals lying in honor have the U.S. Capitol Police as civilian guards of honor. Four Americans have lain in honor, beginning in 1998. Rosa Parks was the first woman to lie in honor in the United States Capitol. Except for Presidents and former Presidents, the honor is not automatic. Not all those entitled to the honor have it accepted by their survivors. The first leader to receive this honor was Henry Clay, former Speaker of the House of Representatives, when he died in 1852. Since then, the honor has been extended to 36 people, including 12 Presidents, and four Unknown Soldiers, representing U.S. service members who have died without their remains being identified. Harry Truman, Richard Nixon and their families declined services at the Capitol. To date, only those who have lain in state have done so upon the catafalque constructed for the funeral of Abraham Lincoln. Those who have lain in honor have been borne on other biers. States and cities Some U.S. states and cities extend similar honors. For example, in the state of Hawaii, eight people have lain in state at the Hawaii State Capitol, among which include famous Hawaiian singer Israel Kamakawiwo ªole upon his death in 1997, U.S. Senator Hiram Fong, in 2004, and Daniel Inouye, President pro tempore of the U.S. Senate and Senator from Hawaii, in 2012. Similarly, upon his death in August 2018, U.S. Senator John McCain lay in state at the State Capitol of his home state of Arizona before receiving the same honor in the U.S. Capitol two days later. After his death in July 2020, U.S. Representative John Lewis received similar honors from his home state of Georgia and also was the first African American member of Congress to lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda. Because of his role in the Selma to Montgomery marches during the civil rights movement, Lewis also lay in state for one day in the Alabama Capitol in Montgomery. In San Francisco, Mayor Ed Lee lay in state in the Rotunda of San Francisco City Hall after his death in office on 12 December 2017. After a memorial service outside the Polk Street entrance of City Hall on 29 November 1978, Mayor George Moscone and city Supervisor Harvey Milk lay in state in the Rotunda until 30 November, after their assassination by former Supervisor Dan White. The chamber was also filled with more than 400 floral tributes to the two men. Vatican City Pope John Paul II's body lying in state. A deceased pope customarily lies in state in the chapel of the Apostolic Palace where members of the Papal household and Vatican officials may pay respects. Then, after a Mass of Visitation, the body is moved to St. Peter's Basilica, where it remains until the celebration of a Requiem Mass. The funeral of Pope John Paul II followed this custom. Vietnam The preserved body of Ho Chi Minh lies in state in the purpose built Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum at the Ho Chi Minh Museum in Hanoi and is open for public viewing. Coptic Patriarchate The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria has a tradition of mummifying the deceased pope and placing his body on his throne to enable church followers to have a farewell look at him for a short period of time. This tradition is one of the ways that ancient Egyptian rituals have survived in the Egyptian church.

Adjacent to the mall is Hudson Valley Plaza, a two-tiered complex on a west-facing hill, consisting mainly of a Walmart, PetSmart and a few other shops (including formerly a Toys \\"R\\" Us). History The Hudson Valley Mall opened in 1981 with a Kmart, JCPenney, Hess's, and a Hoyt's six-screen theater named Cinema 6(later expanded to 12 screens and renamed after Regal Cinemas bought the theater). An expansion during 1989 added a Sears to the east side of the mall as well as a new food court and approximately 15 other stores. During 1995 Hess's, which filed for bankruptcy, and Kmart, which relocated to a location south of the mall on U.S. Route 9W, vacated the mall within months of each other. (This Kmart location later went out of business and was replaced by a Kohl's). Though the Hess's space was filled the next year by Filene's, the Kmart space at the north end of the mall stayed vacant. During this time, The Pyramid Companies, the mall's owner, began to plan a drastic renovation process. At the beginning of the 21st century, Pyramid invested in the mall, doing a complete renovation of the mall's interior as well as attracting new tenants. The former Kmart space was divided into a Best Buy (opened 2000) and a Dick's Sporting Goods (opened 2001), with the Target company building a new shop adjacent to the space, which was also opened in 2001. On September 9, 2006, the region gained its first Macy's when that company bought the existing Filene's. In 2011, ownership of the mall changed when The Pyramid Companies sold it to PCK Development. PCK had consolidated the mall's outstanding debts during 2010, but did not officially purchase the mall until the next year. In 2015, JCPenney announced it would close its location in the mall due to decreasing sales. It was also during this year that PCK defaulted on its $52.5 million loan from the U.S. National Bank Association (USNBA). During July 2016, as a result of the default, the USNBA took ownership of the mall and began to search for a new owner. During this time period, mall tenants were instructed to pay rent directly to the USNBA. Additionally, the USNBA asked Tennessee- based retail developer CBL & Associates to help search for new mall tenants. Macy's announced its store closure at the Hudson Valley Mall during 2016, also citing a decrease in sales and the company's increased emphasis on its online sales. In 2017, the USNBA finally found a buyer for the mall, Hull Property Group. The sale price of $8.4 million was notably low, partly for the reason that Hull hoped to use it to get a lower property valuation, and thus decrease taxes. After the completion of the sale, Hull announced plans to renovate the mall in the near future. On January 4, 2018, it was announced that Sears would be closing as part of a plan to close 103 stores nationwide. The store closed in April 2018.http://www.dailyfreeman.com/general-news/20180104/sears-store- at-hudson-valley-mall-in-ulster-closing-in-april In August 2018, Regal closed the movie theater, which had operated continuously since the mall's opening. Hull said it was negotiating with another operator to reopen the theater, and hoped to use the opportunity to upgrade the facilities. The former Macy's space was partially demolished and converted to the Hudson River Health Care office in 2019 and is not connected to the mall.https://www.dailyfreeman.com/news/local-news/work-proceeds-to-convert- former-macys-store-at-hudson-valley-mall-to-medical- offices/article_584ac3a8-a4c5-11e9-b7d8-37b6fe0a6fd4.html On September 15, 2020, it was announced that Best Buy would be closing on October 31, 2020 which will leave Dick's Sporting Goods and Target as the only anchors left.https://www.dailyfreeman.com/news/local-news/best-buy-closing-hudson- valley-mall-store-next-month/article_eb5ac97a-f769-11ea-95ef-335d78c84dfd.html Incidents=2005 mall shooting On February 13, 2005, Robert Bonelli, age 24, of Glasco, New York, entered the mall with a semi-automatic AK-47 Variant and began firing it in the mall's Best Buy shop. Panic ensued as employees and shoppers began to flee the mall. Bonelli moved into the mall's main corridor and continued firing his weapon until he ran out of ammunition. After emptying the assault rifle, he promptly dropped it. As Bonelli dropped the weapon, a mall employee grabbed his gun, and another tackled him. The mall was evacuated and Bonelli was taken into custody. No one was killed in the shooting, but two people, a 20-year-old National Guard recruiter and a 56-year-old male shopper, were wounded. After the incident, Ulster County investigators searched Bonelli's room at the home he shared with his father, and found what Ulster County District Attorney Donald Williams described as \\"Columbine memorabilia\\". Officials described the young man as being fascinated by the Columbine High School massacre. Additional searches were conducted by police after videos seized at Bonelli's residence showed him exploding homemade pipe bombs with a man named Kenneth Stine and another individual. Both individuals were later arrested and charged with violating federal explosives laws. Bonelli was taken to the Ulster County jail; on March 15, 2006, Bonelli pleaded guilty and on May 20, 2006 was sentenced to 32 years in the state prison (the maximum allowed by the guilty plea). He will be eligible for parole in 26 years. 2006 murder of Sharon Inger Some time between closing time of the Ground Round restaurant in the mall on Saturday, June 3, and the morning of Sunday around 9:00 a.m., June 4, 2006, a suspect entered the Ground Round and stabbed a 42-year-old employee, named Sharon Inger, approximately 33 times. Inger, who worked as a night manager of the restaurant, was found early Sunday morning when another employee arrived to open the restaurant. $4000 was missing, according to night receipts. On September 21, 2006, police named Paul David Despres as the killer of Sharon Inger. Despres had begun employment with the Ground Round just a couple of weeks earlier. Investigators believe he went to the restaurant to steal his personnel file after giving a false name to police during a traffic stop earlier on the night of the murder, at around 11:00 p.m. Police believe he had a confrontation with Inger, grabbed a knife in the kitchen, and killed her at about 12:45 a.m. Two weeks later, Despres died after jumping, while intoxicated, from a vehicle after leaving a party.

The type of boat being used is a carbon-fiber shell made by Resolute. Rowing is the act of propelling a boat using the motion of oars in the water by displacing water to propel the boat forward. Rowing and paddling are similar. However, rowing requires oars to have a mechanical connection with the boat, while paddles (used for paddling) are hand-held and have no mechanical connection. This article focuses on the general types of rowing, such as the recreation and the transport rather than the sport of competitive rowing which is a specialized case of racing using strictly regulated equipment and a highly refined technique.  History of rowing  galley and Dutch man-of-war off a port In the Ancient World, all major ancient civilizations used rowing for transportation, commerce, and war. It was considered a way to advance their civilization during war and peace. Ancient Egypt The beginning of rowing is clouded in history but the use of oars in the way they are used today can be traced back to ancient Egypt. Whether it was invented in Egypt or something learned from Mesopotamia via trade is not known. However, archaeologists have recovered a model of a rowing vessel in a tomb dating back to the 18-19th century BC. From Egypt, rowing vessels, especially galleys, were extensively used in naval warfare and trade in the Mediterranean from classical antiquity onward. Galleys had advantages over sailing ships: they were easier to maneuver, capable of short bursts of speed, and able to move independently of the wind. Ancient Greece During the classical age of oared galleys, the Greeks dominated the Mediterranean while the Athenians dominated the other Greeks. They used thousands of lower- class citizens to serve as rowers in the fleet.The Lost Technology of Ancient Greek,John R. Hale, Publisher: Scientific American, Vol. 274, No. 5 (MAY 1996), pp. 82-85. The Classical trireme used 170 rowers; later galleys included even larger crews. Trireme oarsmen used leather cushions to slide over their seats, which allowed them to use their leg strength as a modern oarsman does with a sliding seat. Galleys usually had masts and sails, but would lower them at the approach of combat. Greek fleets would even leave their sails and masts on shore (as being unnecessary weight) if possible.The Athenian Trireme: The History and Reconstruction of an Ancient Greek Warship. J. S. Morrison, J. F. Coates, N. B. Rankov. Publisher: Cambridge University Press; 2 edition (20 Jul 2000), , Northern Europe The use of oars in rowing instead of paddling came rather late to northern Europe, sometime between 500 BC-1 AD. This change might have been hastened by the Roman conquest of Northern Gaul. However, between 500-1100 AD, combined sailing and rowing vessels dominated trade and warfare in northern Europe in the time that has come to be known as the Viking Age. Galleys continued to be used in the Mediterranean until the advent of steam propulsion.  Types of rowing systems  Rearward-facing rowing system In some localities, rear-facing systems prevail. In other localities, forward-facing systems prevail, especially in crowded areas such as in Venice, Italy and in Asian and Indonesian rivers and harbors. This is not strictly an \\"either-or\\", because in different situations it's useful to be able to row a boat facing either way. The current emphasis on the health aspects of rowing has resulted in some new mechanical systems being developed, some (such as the Rantilla rowing method) very different from the traditional rowing systems of the past. Rearward-facing systems A forward-facing rowing technique used in the Slovenian pletna Out on the lagoon at Toledo State Hospital in a rowboat This is probably the oldest system used in Europe and North America. A seated rower pulls on one or two oars, which lever the boat through the water. The pivot point of the oars (attached solidly to the boat) is the fulcrum or the oar-lock. The motive force is applied through the rower's feet. In traditional rowing craft, the pivot point of the oars is generally located on the boat's gunwale. The actual fitting that holds the oar may be as simple as one or two pegs (or thole pins) or a metal oarlock (also called rowlock - \\"rollock\\"). In performance rowing craft, the rowlock is usually extended outboard on a \\"rigger\\" to allow the use of a longer oar for increased power. Sculling involves a seated rower who pulls on two oars or sculls, attached to the boat, thereby moving the boat in the direction opposite that which the rower faces. In some multiple-seat boats seated rowers each pull on a single \\"sweep\\" oar, usually with both hands. Boats in which the rowers are coordinated by a coxswain are referred to as a \\"coxed\\" pair/four/eight. Sometimes sliding seats are used to enable the rower to use the leg muscles, substantially increasing the power available. An alternative to the sliding seat, called a sliding rigger, uses a stationary seat and the rower moves the oarlocks with his feet. On a craft used in Italy, the catamaran moscone, the rower stands and takes advantage of his body weight to increase leverage while sculling. Forward-facing systems Articulated or bow facing oars have two-piece oars and use a mechanical transmission to reverse the direction of the oar blade, enabling a seated rower to row facing forward with a pulling motion. Push rowing, also called back-watering if used in a boat not designed for forward motion, uses regular oars with a pushing motion to achieve forward-facing travel, sometimes seated and sometimes standing. This is a convenient method of manoeuvring in a narrow waterway or through a busy harbour. The \\"Rantilla\\" system of frontrowing oars uses inboard mounted oarlocks rather than a reversing transmission to achieve forward motion of the boat with a pulling motion on the oars. Another system (also called sculling) involves using a single oar extending from the stern of the boat which is moved side to side underwater somewhat like a fish tail, such as the Chinese yuloh, by which quite large boats can be moved.The Junks and Sampans of the Yangtze G. R. G. Worcester. Publisher: Naval Institute Press; 1971, , Sampans are rowed by foot in Ninh B√¨nh Province of northern Vietnam. The Intha people of Burma row forwards using their legs. The pletna of Slovenia is rowed forward in the standing position with two oars.  Venetian rowing  A Gondola in Venice In Venice, gondolas and other similar flat- bottomed boatsLe barche at www.vogaveneta.it are popular forms of transport propelled by oars which are held in place by an open wooden f√≥rcola.La forcola - le barche per la Voga alla Veneta at www.vogaveneta.it The Voga alla VenetaVenetian rowing technique at www.venetia.it technique of rowing is considerably different from the style used in international sport rowing, due to the oarsman facing forward in a standing position. This allows the boat to maneuver very quickly and with agility - useful in the narrow and busy canals of Venice. Competitive regattas are also held using the Venetian rowing technique by using both gondolas and other types of vessels. There are three styles of Venetian rowing, each slightly different. The first consists of a single oarsman with one oar, standing near the stern of the boat where the oar also acts as a rudder. The second style consists of one or two oarsmen, each with two crossed oars (known as a la vales√†na). The third style has two or more oarsmen, rowing on alternate sides of the boat.  Design factors  The classic shapes of rowboats reflect an evolution of hundreds of years of trial and error to get a good shape. Some factors to be considered are waterline length, speed, carrying capacity, stability, windage, weight, seaworthiness, cost, waterline beam, the fullness or fineness of the ends, and trim. Design details are a compromise between competing factors. Width and height If the waterline beam (width) is too narrow the boat will be tender and the occupant at risk of falling out, if the beam is too wide the boat will be slow and have more resistance to waves. Overall beam (width) is important. If the rowlocks are too close together the oars will be difficult to use. If the rowlocks are too far apart then the boat will be overly large and rowing will be inefficient, wasting a rower's effort. Sometimes on narrow, faster rowboats for protected waters outriggers are added to increase rowlock separation. If the freeboard (height of the gunwale above the waterline) is too high then windage will be high and as a result, the boat will be caught by the wind and the rower will not be able to control the boat in high winds. If the freeboard is too low, water will enter the boat through waves. If the boat is designed for one person then only a single rowing position is required. If the rower is to carry a passenger at the stern then the boat will be stern heavy and trim will be incorrect. Length When it comes to how long the rowing boat should be, it is a compromise between two factors that will affect the speed of the boat. If the boat is too short, the boat will reach a very low maximum speed. If the boat is too long, there will be more friction and more wet surface. Therefore, the minimum recommended length should be around 16 feet. If the boat is longer than that recommended length, the boat is usually narrower and although faster will generally be more difficult to balance. Weight To have good width and the height that ensures the balance of the rowboat, a weight can be added in the bow, alternatively, the boat can supply a second rowing position further forward for this purpose. There are some advantages and disadvantages that are attributed to the weight of the rowboat. A very light boat will most likely start to slow down as soon as the oar stroke has ended. In contrast, a heavier boat will likely continue to move forward. Most modern style rowboats are considerably lighter than traditional clinker-built style.https://www.virginiarowing.com/sculling-boats.html Performance A Sunnm√∏rsf√¶ring; a Norwegian four-oared rowing boat, from the region Sunnm√∏re (Her√∏y kystmuseum, Her√∏y, M√∏re og Romsdal, Norway) Spring in the keel or rocker influences how a rowboat performs. Longer, slender race boats have less rocker of about . A short pram dinghy has a rocker of . Boats with less rocker are easier to row and faster in flat or nearly flat water. However, in any waves a boat with of rocker will be more seaworthy‚Äîrising over waves rather than going through them. A boat with more rocker can change direction easily whereas a straight keel boat will track well in a straight line but resist turning. High sided and fine-ended boats, such as dories, are affected by wind. Their trim can be altered by using a plastic container of water attached to a rope that can be moved to the bow or stern as need be. Long-distance rowers can keep up a steady 20 strokes per minute compared to a racing shell which can be rowed at 32‚Äì36 strokes per minute by fit athletes. A rower can maintain 40 strokes per minute for only a brief period. Longer, narrower rowboats can reach but most rowboats of can be rowed at .Backyard Boatbulder. p 158‚Äì160. J. Welsford. Reed. Auckland 1999. Many old rowboats have very full ends (blunt ends); these may appear at first glance to be bad design as it looks slow, not fast. However a full-ended rowboat will rise to a sea and not dig in as a finer hulled boat might do, thus a compromise needs to be made between the factors of speed and of seaworthiness. This style of rowboat was designed to carry a bigger load and the full sections gave far more displacement. Also older boats were often very heavily constructed compared to their modern counterpart, hence weighed far more. A rowing boat designed as a tender carrying occupants to a boat on a mooring might tend to be short, whilst a boat for use on rivers and to travel long distances might be long and narrow. Oars Over time the design, of both the oars and the blades, has significantly changed. Typically, the oars part that is inboard of the rowlock stayed the same length but the outboard part got shorter. The different lengths of the oars affect both the energy that the rower has to put in as well as the performance, in terms of speed of the rowboat. A short oar makes quick but short strokes possible. A short oar is easier to use in a narrow creek or a crowded anchorage. This is important in a small tender which may be heavily laden with passengers, limiting the swing of the oars. A short, quick stroke prevents the bow being driven under in choppy waters while heavily laden. Longer oars can be used to produce longer, slower strokes, which are easier to maintain over long distances. Designers may match oar length to the amount of space provided for oar storage in the boat. Wooden oars are generally made of a light, strong wood, such as fir or ash. The blades can either be flat for general use or spooned for faster propulsion.  Whitehall rowboats  The origins of this distinctive and practical craft are unclear. In earlier times, however, builders were often sailors or seafaring men. Successful designs for large and small craft alike evolved slowly and as certain desirable qualities were attained and perfected they rarely changed. Some hold that the Whitehall rowing boat design was introduced from England. However the famed nautical historian Howard I. Chapelle, cites the opinion of the late W. P. Stephens that in New York City there is a Whitehall Street and this was where the Whitehall was first built. Chapelle, Stephens and others agree that the design came into existence some time in the 1820s in New York City, having first been built by navy yard apprentices who had derived their model to some extent from the old naval gig.

It was nominated for the Nebula Award in 1970, and for both the Hugo and Locus Awards in 1971. Plot summary The plot involves a 24th-century entrepreneur-tycoon-scientist, Simeon Krug, who has created a race of androids to serve humanity. Krug, probably Earth's wealthiest man, directs the construction of an immense tower of glass in the Canadian tundra. The edifice is not a monument, however, but a way to communicate with a distant planetary nebula, NGC 7293, from which an intelligent (though indecipherable) message has been received. Krug is also building a starship to send there, which is to be crewed by androids in hibernation. The tower construction is directed by Krug's most faithful android, Alpha Thor Watchman. Thor and other leading androids have invented a secret religion for androids, based on the vision that their creator, Krug, intends to eventually make them equal to humans. Krug is unaware of the religion. Thor's dream is to convince him through indirect means, including the manipulation of his weak-willed son and heir, Manuel, through a sexual relationship with a female android, Alpha Lilith Meson. Thor eventually falls in love with her, as does Manuel. After Thor and Lilith have manipulated Manuel into telling his father about the android religion, Krug insists that the minds of he and Thor be connected in the \\"shunt room\\" which allows one mind to probe another'ssee description on p. 30 of Voices for the future: essays on major science fiction writers by Thomas D. Clareson (a form of technologically enabled telepathy). Thor discovers via the link that Krug regards androids as mere things, and has no intention of treating them as equal to womb-born humans. Realizing that Krug will never give freedom to androids, Thor despairs, loses his faith and announces Krug's true nature to androids worldwide. With the collapse of their religion, androids across all of Earth rebel. Many walk off their jobs, others take control of key Earth installations, and some even kill humans in their long-suppressed rage. Thor then causes the fall of the nearly-complete, tower. An enraged Krug attacks Thor; the latter, unable to fight his creator, is pushed into an unprogrammed teleporter and annihilated. Krug, his empire destroyed and humanity in grave danger, flees in his starship, alone, towards the star system from which the alien message was sent.

His name has been written as Mauritz Frederik de Haas, Maurice F. H. de Haas, Maurice Frederic Henri de Haas, Mauritz Frederick Hendrick De Haas, \\"Maurice Frederick Hendrick de Haas\\", as well as various other variations. Biography De Haas was born in Rotterdam, Netherlands. He studied art at the Rotterdam Academy and at The Hague, under Johannes Bosboom and Louis Meyer, and in 1851-1852 in London, following the English watercolourists of the day. In 1857 he received an artist's commission in the Dutch Navy, but in 1859, under the patronage of August Belmont, who had recently been minister of the United States at The Hague, he resigned and moved to New York City. He became an associate of the National Academy in 1863 and an academician in 1867, and exhibited annually in the academy, and in 1866 he was one of the founders of the American Society of Painters in Water Colors. He died in New York City.

(Other subdivision boundaries began to change in 2009.) Touba Department was created in 1969 as one of the 24 new departments that were created to take the place of the six departments that were being abolished. It was created from territory that was formerly part of Nord Department. Using current boundaries as a reference, from 1969 to 2008 the department occupied the territory that is Bafing Region. In 1997, regions were introduced as new first-level subdivisions of Ivory Coast; as a result, all departments were converted into second-level subdivisions. Touba Department was initially included as part of Worodougou Region, but in 2000 Touba Department was placed in the newly formed Bafing Region.

The album title is an anagram of the artist's fuller name; Michael Doughty. Doughty described the album as \\"a bunch of songs about yearning and redemption and happiness and hope.\\" The album's sound is dense, stuffed full of multi-tracked guitars, horns, keyboards, and Doughty's own voice multiplied over himself in harmony; a departure both from the sounds of Soul Coughing and Doughty's solo acoustic work. It was gradually recorded over the course of two years at the home of producer Dan Wilson (of Semisonic). In contrast to his previous stripped-down releases, Doughty brought in many other musicians to record Haughty Melodic, including multi-instrumentalist Shahzad Ismaily, upright bass player John Munson, and N.E.R.D. drummer Eric Fawcett. On Amazon.com, iTunes, and other places online that carried listener reviews, the record was either trashed with indignant one star reviews that decried it as overproduced, or defended passionately by fans that lavished four or five stars on it. Some fans, many new ones brought in by the single \\"Looking at the World from the Bottom of a Well\\"‚Äîpeculiarly, a radio hit based on a scene from Haruki Murakami's novel The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle‚Äîwere struck by the imagery drawn from Doughty's recovery from drug addiction, and the album's themes of loss and redemption. The album's arduous process began when Doughty flew out to Minneapolis to collaborate with Wilson on a bridge for his song \\"Busting Up a Starbucks.\\" Wilson and Doughty had been set up by their mutual manager, Jim Grant. The two wrote the song \\"American Car,\\" and made simple demos of guitar, piano and drum machine, which inspired Doughty so much that he tapped Wilson to produce a full album‚Äîdespite the fact that he had no label and would have to weave recording sessions periodically in Wilson's busy schedule. Doughty would fly out to Minnesota every few weeks for a session‚Äîa few days here, a couple of weeks there‚Äîand as the album gradually took shape it departed from those initial, sparse demos; in the time between sessions Doughty and Wilson would conceive new parts, new instrumentation, ideas for replacing one part for another. Doughty has remarked that he felt tortured by the stop-and-start process of constant re-examination, but in the end believed that the album achieved a kind of perfection through the time and scrutiny.

About 25 percent of all rail traffic in the United States travels through the Chicago area. Yard for Amtrak equipment, located next to the Los Angeles River. The two tracks on the left are the mainline. A rail yard, railway yard or railroad yard is a complex series of railroad tracks for storing, sorting, or loading and unloading, railroad cars and locomotives. Railroad yards have many tracks in parallel for keeping rolling stock stored off the mainline, so that they do not obstruct the flow of traffic. Railroad cars are moved around by specially designed yard switchers, a type of locomotive. Cars in a railroad yard may be sorted by numerous categories, including railway company, loaded or unloaded, destination, car type, or whether they need repairs. Railroad yards are normally built where there is a need to store cars while they are not being loaded or unloaded, or are waiting to be assembled into trains. Large yards may have a tower to control operations. Many railway yards are located at strategic points on a main line. Main-line yards are often composed of an up yard and a down yard, linked to the associated railroad direction. There are different types of yards, and different parts within a yard, depending on how they are built.  Freight yards  For freight cars, the overall yard layout is typically designed around a principal switching (US term) or shunting (UK) technique: * A flat yard has no hump, and relies on locomotives for all car movements. * A gravity yard is built on a natural slope and relies less on locomotives; generally locomotives will control a consist being sorted from uphill of the cars about to be sorted. They are decoupled and let to accelerate into the classification equipment lower down. * A hump yard has a constructed hill, over which freight cars are shoved by yard locomotives, and then gravity is used to propel the cars to various sorting tracks; Sorting yard basics  In the case of all classification or sorting yards, human intelligence plays a primary role in setting a strategy for the 'switching operations'; the fewer times coupling operations need to be made and the less distance traveled, the faster the operation, the better the strategy and the sooner the newly configured consist can be joined to its outbound train. * Switching yards, staging yards or Shunting yards are typically graded to be flat yards, where switch engines manually shuffle and maneuver cars from: a) train arrival tracks, to a b) consist breakdown track, c) to an consist assembly track, thence to d) departure tracks of the yard. ** A large sub- group of such yards are known as Staging yards, which are yards serving an end destination that is also a collection yard starting car groups for departure. These seemingly incompatible tasks are because the operating or road company and its locomotive drops off empties and picks up full cars waiting departure which have been spotted and assembled by local switch engines. The long haul carrier makes the round trip with a minimal turn around time, and the local switch engine transfers empties to the loading yard when the industries output is ready to be shipped. ** This activity is duplicated in a Transfer yard, the difference being in the latter many or several businesses and industries are serviced by the local switcher, which is part of the yard equipment, and the industry pays a cargo transfer fee to the railroad or yard operating company. In the staging yard, the locomotive is most likely operated by industry (refinery, chemical company or coal mine personnel); and ownership of the yard in both cases is a matter of business, and could be any imaginable combination. Ownership and operation are quite often a matter of leases and interestsThe Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad was builder and operator of Mountain Top Yard, whereas both were leased to the CNJ, rents and ownership being retained by the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company. * Hump yard and gravity yard tracks are usually highly automated and designed for the efficient break-down, sorting, and recombining of freight into consists, so they are equipped with mechanical retarders (external brakes) and scales that a computer or operator uses along with knowledge of the gradient of the hump to calculate and control the speed of the cars as they roll downhill to their destination tracks. These modern sorting and classification systems are sophisticated enough to allow a first car to roll to a stop near the end of its classification track, and, by slowing the speed of subsequent cars down the hump, shorten the distance for the following series of cars so they can bump and couple gently, without damaging one another. Since overall throughput speed matters, many have small pneumatic, hydraulic or spring-driven braking retarders (below, right) to adjust and slow speed both before and after yard switch points. Along with car tracking and load tracking to destination technologies such as RFID, long trains can be broken down and reconfigured in transfer yards or operations in remarkable time. { - valign=\\"top\\"  A hump classification type of yard. The photographer is positioned near where cars are decoupled and begin to accelerate downhill past a scale. The speed regulation (retarder brakes and speed sensors) devices shown in the foreground adjust the car speed for the calculated soft-coupling on arrival along the sorting track for the consist it is being routed to join.  Smaller local hydraulic \\"Dowty retarders\\" finesse the speed of a car being sorted as it approaches a switch or the new consists to which it is being joined. } Yard nomenclature and components A large freight yard complex may include the following components: * Receiving yard, also called an arrival yard, where locomotives are detached from freight cars, cars are inspected for mechanical problems, and sent to a classification yard; * oft-called Switching yards or Switchyards or sorting yardsyards where cars are sorted for various destinations and assembled into blocks have different formal names in different cultural traditions: ** Classification yard (US and by Canadian National Railway in Canada) or ** Marshalling yard (UK and Canadian Pacific Railway in Canada) * Departure yard where car blocks are assembled into trains; * Car repair yard or Maintenance yard for freight cars; * Engine house (in some yards, a roundhouse) to fuel and service locomotives. * Transfer yard is a yard where consists are dropped off or picked up as a group by through service such as a Unit Train, but managed locally by local switching service locomotives. * Unit tracks may be reserved for Unit trains, which carry a block of cars all of the same origin and destination, and so as through traffic do not get sorted in a classification yard. Such consists often stop in a freight yard for other purposes: inspection, engine servicing, being switched into a longer consist and/or crew changes. Freight yards may have multiple industries adjacent to them where railroad cars are loaded or unloaded and then stored before they move on to their new destination. Major freight yards in the U.S. include the Bailey Yard in North Platte, Nebraska, operated by Union Pacific Railroad; Conway Yard near Pittsburgh, operated by Norfolk Southern Railway; and the Corwith Yards (Corwith Intermodal Facility) in Chicago, operated by BNSF Railway. Major U.K. goods yards (freight) include those in Crewe, Reading and Bescot, near Walsall; which are operated by DB Schenker and Freightliner.  Coach yards  A coach yard in Shanghai, China Coach yards are used for sorting, storing and repairing passenger cars. These yards are located in metropolitan areas near large stations or terminals. An example of a major US coach yard is Sunnyside Yard in New York City, operated by Amtrak. Those that are principally used for storage, such as the West Side Yard in New York, are called \\"layup yards\\"Chicago-L.org. \\"42nd Place Terminal.\\" Accessed 2013-08-30. or \\"stabling yards.\\" Coach yards are commonly flat yards because passenger coaches are heavier than freight carriages, in the unladen state. Major UK coach stabling yards include those in Crewe and Longsight, Manchester, which are operated by various regional train companies.

Lassa mammarenavirus is an emerging virus and a select agent, requiring Biosafety Level 4-equivalent containment. It is endemic in West African countries, especially Sierra Leone, the Republic of Guinea, Nigeria, and Liberia, where the annual incidence of infection is between 300,000 and 500,000 cases, resulting in 5,000 deaths per year. As of 2012 discoveries within the Mano River region of west Africa have expanded the endemic zone between the two known Lassa endemic regions, indicating that LASV is more widely distributed throughout the tropical wooded savannah ecozone in west Africa. There are no approved vaccines against Lassa fever for use in humans.  Discovery  In 1969, missionary nurse Laura Wine fell ill with a mysterious disease she contracted from an obstetrical patient in Lassa, a village in Borno State, Nigeria. She was then transported to Jos, Nigeria where she died. Subsequently, two others became infected, one of whom was fifty-two-year-old nurse Lily Pinneo who had cared for Laura Wine. Samples from Pinneo were sent to Yale University in New Haven where a new virus, that would later be known as Lassa mammarenavirus, was isolated for the first time by Jordi Casals, Sonja Buckley, and others. Casals contracted the fever, and nearly lost his life; one technician died from it. By 1972, the multimammate rat, Mastomys natalensis, was found to be the main reservoir of the virus in West Africa, able to shed virus in its urine and feces without exhibiting visible symptoms.

Genome: The Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters. New York: HarperCollins, 1999. Print. is contained in two RNA segments that code for two proteins each, one in each sense, for a total of four viral proteins. The large segment encodes a small zinc finger protein (Z) that regulates transcription and replication, and the RNA polymerase (L). The small segment encodes the nucleoprotein (NP) and the surface glycoprotein precursor (GP, also known as the viral spike), which is proteolytically cleaved into the envelope glycoproteins GP1 and GP2 that bind to the alpha-dystroglycan receptor and mediate host cell entry. Lassa fever causes hemorrhagic fever frequently shown by immunosuppression. Lassa mammarenavirus replicates very rapidly, and demonstrates temporal control in replication. The first replication step is transcription of mRNA copies of the negative- or minus- sense genome. This ensures an adequate supply of viral proteins for subsequent steps of replication, as the NP and L proteins are translated from the mRNA. The positive- or plus-sense genome, then makes viral complementary RNA (vcRNA) copies of itself. The RNA copies are a template for producing negative-sense progeny, but mRNA is also synthesized from it. The mRNA synthesized from vcRNA are translated to make the GP and Z proteins. This temporal control allows the spike proteins to be produced last, and therefore, delay recognition by the host immune system. Nucleotide studies of the genome have shown that Lassa has four lineages: three found in Nigeria and the fourth in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. The Nigerian strains seem likely to have been ancestral to the others but additional work is required to confirm this.  Receptors  Entry mechanisms of Old World and New World arenaviruses. Lassa mammarenavirus gains entry into the host cell by means of the cell-surface receptor the alpha-dystroglycan (alpha-DG), a versatile receptor for proteins of the extracellular matrix. It shares this receptor with the prototypic Old World arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Receptor recognition depends on a specific sugar modification of alpha-dystroglycan by a group of glycosyltransferases known as the LARGE proteins. Specific variants of the genes encoding these proteins appear to be under positive selection in West Africa where Lassa is endemic. Alpha-dystroglycan is also used as a receptor by viruses of the New World clade C arenaviruses (Oliveros and Latino viruses). In contrast, the New World arenaviruses of clades A and B, which include the important viruses Machupo, Guanarito, Junin, and Sabia in addition to the non pathogenic Amapari virus, use the transferrin receptor 1. A small aliphatic amino acid at the GP1 glycoprotein amino acid position 260 is required for high-affinity binding to alpha-DG. In addition, GP1 amino acid position 259 also appears to be important, since all arenaviruses showing high-affinity alpha-DG binding possess a bulky aromatic amino acid (tyrosine or phenylalanine) at this position. Unlike most enveloped viruses which use clathrin coated pits for cellular entry and bind to their receptors in a pH dependent fashion, Lassa and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus instead use an endocytotic pathway independent of clathrin, caveolin, dynamin and actin. Once within the cell the viruses are rapidly delivered to endosomes via vesicular trafficking albeit one that is largely independent of the small GTPases Rab5 and Rab7. On contact with the endosome pH-dependent membrane fusion occurs mediated by the envelope glycoprotein, which at the lower pH of the endosome binds the lysosome protein LAMP1 which results in membrane fusion and escape from the endosome.  Life cycle  Lassa virus life cycle The life cycle of Lassa mammarenavirus is similar to the Old World arenaviruses. Lassa mammarenavirus enters the cell by the receptor-mediated endocytosis. Which endocytotic pathway is used is not known yet, but at least the cellular entry is sensitive to cholesterol depletion. It was reported that virus internalization is limited upon cholesterol depletion. The receptor used for cell entry is alpha-dystroglycan, a highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed cell surface receptor for extracellular matrix proteins. Dystroglycan, which is later cleaved into alpha-dystroglycan and beta- dystroglycan is originally expressed in most cells to mature tissues, and it provides molecular link between the ECM and the actin-based cytoskeleton. After the virus enters the cell by alpha-dystroglycan mediated endocytosis, the low-pH environment triggers pH-dependent membrane fusion and releases RNP (viral ribonucleoprotein) complex into the cytoplasm. Viral RNA is unpacked, and replication and transcription initiate in the cytoplasm. As replication starts, both S and L RNA genomes synthesize the antigenomic S and L RNAs, and from the antigenomic RNAs, genomic S and L RNA are synthesized. Both genomic and antigenomic RNAs are needed for transcription and translation. The S RNA encodes GP and NP (viral nucleocapsid protein) proteins, while L RNA encodes Z and L proteins. The L protein most likely represents the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. When the cell is infected by the virus, L polymerase is associated with the viral RNP and initiates the transcription of the genomic RNA. The 5‚Äô and 3‚Äô terminal 19 nt viral promoter regions of both RNA segments are necessary for recognition and binding of the viral polymerase. The primary transcription first transcribes mRNAs from the genomic S and L RNAs, which code NP and L proteins, respectively. Transcription terminates at the stem- loop (SL) structure within the intergenomic region. Arenaviruses use a cap snatching strategy to gain the cap structures from the cellular mRNAs, and it is mediated by the endonuclease activity of the L polymerase and the cap binding activity of NP. Antigenomic RNA transcribes viral genes GPC and Z, encoded in genomic orientation, from S and L segments respectively. The antigenomic RNA also serves as the template for the replication. After translation of GPC, it is posttranslationally modified in the endoplasmic reticulum. GPC is cleaved into GP1 and GP2 at the later stage of the secretory pathway. It has been reported that the cellular protease SKI-1/S1P is responsible for this cleavage. The cleaved glycoproteins are incorporated into the virion envelope when the virus buds and release from the cell membrane.  Pathogenesis  Lassa fever is mostly caused by the Lassa mammarenavirus. The symptoms include flu-like illness characterized by fever, general weakness, cough, sore throat, headache, and gastrointestinal manifestations. Hemorrhagic manifestations include vascular permeability. Upon entry, the Lassa mammarenavirus infects almost every tissue in the human body. It starts with the mucosa, intestine, lungs and urinary system, and then progresses to the vascular system.Donaldson, Ross I. (2009). The Lassa Ward:One Man's Fight Against One of the World's Deadliest Diseases. St. Martin's Press. . . The main targets of the virus are antigen-presenting cells, mainly dendritic cells) and endothelial cells. In 2012 it was reported how Lassa mammarenavirus nucleoprotein (NP) sabotages the host's innate immune system response. Generally, when a pathogen enters into a host, innate defense system recognizes the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) and activates an immune response. One of the mechanisms detects double stranded RNA (dsRNA), which is only synthesized by negative-sense viruses. In the cytoplasm, dsRNA receptors, such as RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene I) and MDA-5 (melanoma differentiation associated gene 5), detect dsRNAs and initiate signaling pathways that translocate IRF-3 (interferon regulatory factor 3) and other transcription factors to the nucleus. Translocated transcription factors activate expression of interferons ùõÇ and ùõÉ, and these initiate adaptive immunity. NP encoded in Lassa mammarenavirus is essential in viral replication and transcription, but it also suppresses host innate IFN response by inhibiting translocation of IRF-3. NP of Lassa mammarenavirus is reported to have an exonuclease activity to only dsRNAs. the NP dsRNA exonuclease activity counteracts IFN responses by digesting the PAMPs thus allowing the virus to evade host immune responses.

Originally formed as a charity providing direct assistance to the poor, its mission has evolved include research and advocacy as well as legal and informational support services for other organizations that work with low-income individuals. It is one of the seven organizations supported by The New York Times \\"Neediest Cases Fund\\". History The Community Service Society was formed in 1939 by the merger of two of New York City's most prominent social welfare organizations, the Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor, organized in 1843 and incorporated in 1848, and the Charity Organization Society, founded in 1882. Purpose CSS tackles poverty on many fronts, bringing a unique perspective to the field of urban poverty. From Government agencies to elected officials; from grass roots advocacy groups to major media outlets, CSS works to raise awareness about, and provide solutions to the problems facing low-income New Yorkers. The Community Service Society: *Conducts research that helps shape public policies concerning poverty. *Advocates for low-income New Yorkers at all levels of government. *Provides direct services and technical assistance to individuals and organizations. *Engages volunteers who help build stronger communities. Programs CSS works independently and in coalition with other organizations on issues of urban poverty in the areas of health care, affordable housing, the labor market, public benefit programs and properly financed public education. The coexistence of CSS's program and policy work have resulted in the creation of model programs such as the Retired Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP). Conceived on Staten Island in 1967 with 23 volunteers, RSVP now is one of the largest volunteer programs for older adults in the United States, with 9 000 men and women volunteering in agencies throughout the city. CSS has also engaged in Community development initiatives: Through employment projects, tenant associations, health care and civic participation that engaged the residents in finding innovative ways to fortify their community, the Gates Avenue project helped to revitalize a neighborhood in Bedford‚ÄìStuyvesant, Brooklyn. CSS's Social Services Department serves individuals, families and seniors who are undergoing a temporary emergency with a range of services from eviction prevention, financial assistance to housing and job searches. In November 2009, CSS acquired City Limits Magazine.

It is made up of 11 vignettes, all revolving around a bar and brothel owned by Lady Sally McGee, wife of Mike Callahan. The stories are written in the same fast-paced, pun-laced prose Robinson is noted for. Plot The storyline focuses on Maureen, an underage streetwalker who is stabbed by her pimp in a dark alley one night. Fortunately for Maureen, Lady Sally is nearby: she had been walking her werebeagle. After defeating the pimp in hand-to-hand combat, Sally brings Maureen home. Her brothel has a fully functioning medical facility, where Maureen is treated and healed. She falls in love with the place for its ambiance and safety but is rejected as an employee for many reasons. Most importantly, she is underage but she also has severe self-loathing issues. Lady Sally enjoys the fact that Maureen comes to accept and befriend the werebeagle and a talking German Shepherd but this is not enough let the main character stay. Maureen's old pimp tracks down the brothel and puts many of the visitors in danger. Maureen uses her wits to help defeat the man; this convinces Sally to let her stay in a non-sexual context. The plot skips to Maureen becoming eighteen, she is allowed to take on sexual duties. The rest of the plot focuses on three different subsequent incidents. There is 'Colt', a client with an unusual addiction that nobody seems to notice, one that presents various threats. Later, Maureen and her close friend Phillip swiftly realize that they are doing many things they do not wish to do over the course of their work-day. The concept of 'being forced into it' is something that Lady Callahan and her staff oppose in many, varied ways. Maureen and Phillip find that they are keeping quiet about this, even though they wish to tell everyone possible. The last incident focuses on Maureen's old friend, the Professor, who needs fifty thousand quick or he will die horribly. A very specific, very counterfeit fifty thousand. Like other books in the Callahan series, puns are a focus, sometimes seriously.

The Iverni (, ') were a people of early Ireland first mentioned in Ptolemy's 2nd century Geography as living in the extreme south- west of the island.Ptolemy. Geography. 2.2.6 (ed. K. M√ºller [Paris 1883‚Äì1901]) He also locates a \\"city\\" called Ivernis (, ') in their territory, and observes that this settlement has the same name as the island as a whole, Ivernia (, ').Ptol. Geog. 2.2.9; 8.3.4 The name Iverni has been derived from Proto-Indo- European *, \\"the fertile land\\". It was probably once the name given to all the peoples of Ireland, but by Ptolemy's time had a more restricted usage applicable to the inhabitants of the south-west.John T. Koch, Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia, ABC-CLIO, 2005, p.709 These Iverni can be identified linguistically with the √ârainn (√âraind, √ârnai, √ârna), a people attested in Munster and elsewhere in the early Middle Ages. The prehistoric √ârainn royal dynasties are sometimes referred to as the D√°irine.DIL Letter: D1 (D-Deg√≥ir), Columns 35 and 36O'Rahilly, pp. 7, 189 Historical septs In early Irish genealogical tracts the √ârainn are regarded as an ethnic group, distinct from the Laigin and Cruthin. Population groups in Munster classed as √ârainn include the Corcu Lo√≠gde in southwest County Cork, the M√∫scraige in Counties Cork and Tipperary, the Corcu Duibne in County Kerry, and the Corcu Baiscinn in west County Clare. The D√°l Riata and D√°l Fiatach (or Ulaid) in Ulster are also considered √ârainn. The √ârainn appear to have been a powerful group in the proto-historic period, but in early historical times were largely reduced to politically marginal status, with the notable exception of the enigmatic Osraige. The most important of the Munster √ârainn, the Corcu Lo√≠gde, retained some measure of prestige even after they had become marginalised by the E√≥ganachta in the 7th or 8th century.Charles Doherty, \\"√ârainn\\", in Se√°n Duffy (ed.), Medieval Ireland: an encyclopedia, 2005, CRC Press, pp. 156‚Äì157 It is likely that the sometimes powerful U√≠ Liath√°in and their close kin the U√≠ Fidgenti originally belonged to the √ârainn/D√°irine as well, but were later counted among the E√≥ganachta for political reasons.John V. Kelleher, \\"The Rise of the D√°l Cais\\", in √âtienne Rynne (ed.), North Munster Studies: Essays in Commemoration of Monsignor Michael Moloney. Limerick: Thomond Archaeological Society. 1967. pp. 230‚Äì41.Gear√≥id Mac Niocaill, Ireland before the Vikings. Dublin: Gill and Macmillan. 1972. Another prominent √ârainn people of early Munster are believed to have been the Mairtine, who by the early historical period have completely vanished from the Irish landscape, although they may be in part ancestral to the later D√©isi Tuisceart and D√°l gCais.D√°ibh√≠ √ì Cr√≥in√≠n, \\"Ireland, 400‚Äì800\\", in D√°ibh√≠ √ì Cr√≥in√≠n (ed.), A New History of Ireland (Volume 1): Prehistoric and Early Ireland. Oxford University Press. 2005. p. 222 The D√©isi Muman may also have had √ârainn origins, but this has long been disputed. D√°ire: Darini, D√°irine It seems likely the Iverni were related to the Darini of eastern Ulster.for extensive discussion, see Julius Pokorny. \\"Beitr√§ge zur √§ltesten Geschichte Irlands (3. √ârainn, D√°ri(n)ne und die Iverni und Darini des Ptolom√§us)\\", in Zeitschrift f√ºr celtische Philologie 12 (1918): 323‚Äì57. The name \\"Darini\\" implies descent from an ancestor called D√°ire, (*DƒÅrios) as claimed by several historical peoples identified as √ârainn, including the D√°l Riata and D√°l Fiatach in eastern UlsterDonnchadh √ì Corr√°in, \\"Prehistoric and Early Christian Ireland\\", in R. F. Foster (ed.), The Oxford Illustrated History of Ireland, Oxford University Press, 2001 as well as the √ârainn of Munster. An early name for Dundrum, County Down, is recorded as D√∫n Droma D√°irine, and the name D√°irine was applied to the Corcu Lo√≠gde, further suggesting a relationship between the Darini and the Iverni. √ârainn: Clanna Dedad The genealogies trace the descent of the √ârainn from two separate eponymous ancestors, Ailill √ârann and √çar mac Dedad. Legendary relatives of the latter include the Cland Dedad (offspring of Deda mac Sin), a Munster people who appear in the Ulster Cycle, led by C√∫ Ro√≠, son of D√°ire mac Dedad, and the legendary High King Conaire M√≥r, grandson of Iar and ancestor of the S√≠l Conairi. The historical sept of the U√≠ Maicc Iair (\\"grandsons of the son of Iar\\") and the MAQI IARI of ogham inscriptions also appear to be related.Eoin MacNeill, \\"Early Irish Population Groups: their nomenclature, classification and chronology\\", Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy (C) 29, 1911, pp. 59‚Äì114 The personal name Iar is simply another variant of the root present in Iverni and √ârainn.MacNeill 1911 Finally, the name √çth, given in the genealogies as the ultimate ancestor of the Corcu Lo√≠gde (D√°irine) and offering some confusion about their parentage and relation to the Iverni, in fact preserves the same Indo-European root *peiH- (\\"to be fat, swell\\"),John T. Koch. \\"√âriu\\", in John T. Koch (ed.). Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia. ABC-CLIO. 2006. pp. 709‚Äì18 thus in effect completing a basic picture of the Iverni/√ârainn and their kindred in later historical Ireland. O'Rahilly's theory Ivernic is a hypothetical language proposed by T. F. O'Rahilly. He suggested that it was an unattested P-Celtic (probably Brittonic) language spoken in Ireland before Irish. He suggested this language was spoken by the Iverni (hence its modern name), and that they invaded Ireland from Britain, bringing with them the language. O'Rahilly identifies two words recorded in the Sanas Cormaic as coming from Ivernic: ond = \\"stone\\" and fern = \\"anything good\\". His theory has been refuted and is not widely accepted by experts.Koch, John T. Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia. ABC-CLIO, 2006. p.750Martin Ball and James Fife. The Celtic Languages.

His elementary education started in a comprehensive primary school at Longlier, his birthplace. He served in the British Intelligence Service during the First World War, and got imprisoned in concentration camps twice. In recognition of his service, he was granted enrolment at the University of Li√®ge in Belgium to study medicine without any formal education required for the course. He earned his Doctor of Medicine degree in 1928. Devoted to medical research, he initially joined German institutes in Berlin. In 1929 he found an opportunity to join the Rockefeller Institute in New York. At Rockefeller University he made his most groundbreaking achievements in cell biology. In 1930 he developed the technique of cell fractionation, by which he discovered the agent of the Rous sarcoma, components of cell organelles such as mitochondrion, chloroplast, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, ribosome and lysosome. He was the first to employ the electron microscope in the field of biology. In 1945 he published the first detailed structure of cell. His collective works established the complex functional and structural properties of cells. Claude served as director at Jules Bordet Institute for Cancer Research and Treatment and Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire et Canc√©rologie in Louvain-la-Neuve ; Professor at the Free University of Brussels, the University of Louvain, and Rockefeller University. For his pioneering works he received the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize in 1970, together with George Palade and Keith Porter, the Paul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedter Prize in 1971, and the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1974 with his student George Palade and friend Christian de Duve. Early life and education Albert Claude was born in 1899 (but according to civil register 1898) in Longlier, a hamlet in Neufch√¢teau, Belgium, to Florentin Joseph Claude and Marie-Glaudice Watriquant Claude. He was the youngest among three brothers and one sister. His father was a Paris-trained baker and run a bakery-cum-general store at Longlier valley near railroad station. His mother, who developed breast cancer in 1902, died when he was seven years old. He spent his pre-school life with his ailing mother. He started education in Longlier Primary School, a pluralistic school of single room, mixed grades, and all under one teacher. In spite of the inconveniences, he remarked the education system as \\"excellent.\\" He served as a bell boy, ringing church bell every morning at 6. Due to economic depression the family moved to Athus, a prosperous region with steel mills, in 1907. He entered German-speaking school. After two years he was asked to look after his uncle who was disabled with cerebral haemorrhage in Longlier. He dropped out of school and practically nursed his uncle for several years. At the outbreak of the First World War he was apprenticed to steel mills and worked as an industrial designer. Inspired by Winston Churchill, then British Minister of War, he joined the resistance and volunteered in British Intelligence Service in which he served during the whole war. At the end of the war he was decorated with the Interallied Medal along with veteran status. He then wanted to continue education. Since he had no formal secondary education, particularly required for medicine course, such as in Greek and Latin, he tried to join School of Mining in Li√®ge. By that time Marcel Florkin became head of the Direction of Higher Education in Belgium's Ministry of Public Instruction, and under his administration passed the law that enabled war veterans to pursue higher education without diploma or other examinations. As an honour to his war service, he was given admission to the University of Li√®ge in 1922 to study medicine. He obtained his degree of Doctor of Medicine in 1928. Career Claude received travel grants from Belgian government for his doctoral thesis on the transplantation of mouse cancers into rats. With this he worked his postdoctoral research in Berlin during the winter of 1928‚Äì1929, first at the Institut f√ºr Krebsforschung, and then at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology, Dahlem, in the laboratory of tissues culture of Prof. Albert Fischer. Back in Belgium he received fellowship in 1929 from the Belgian American Educational Foundation (Commission for Relief in Belgium, CRB) for research in the United States. He applied for the Rockefeller Institute (now the Rockefeller University) in New York, USA. Simon Flexner, then Director, accepted his proposal to work on the isolation and identification of the Rous sarcoma virus. In September 1929 he joined the Rockefeller Institute. In 1930, he discovered the process of cell fractionation, which was groundbreaking in his time. The process consists of grinding up cells to break the membrane and release the cell's contents. He then filtered out the cell membranes and placed the remaining cell contents in a centrifuge to separate them according to mass. He divided the centrifuged contents into fractions, each of a specific mass, and discovered that particular fractions were responsible for particular cell functions. In 1938 he identified and purified for the first time component of Rous sarcoma virus, the causal agent of carcinoma, as \\"ribose nucleoprotein\\" (eventually named RNA). He was the first to use electron microscope to study biological cells. Earlier electron microscopes were used only in physical researches. His first electron microscopic study was on the structure of mitochondria in 1945. He was given American citizenship in 1941. He discovered that mitochondria are the \\"power houses\\" of all cells. He also discovered cytoplasmic granules full of RNA and named them \\"microsomes\\", which were later renamed ribosomes, the protein synthesizing machineries of cell. With his associate, Keith Porter, he found a \\"lace-work\\" structure that was eventually proven to be the major structural feature of the interior of all eukaryotic cells. This was the discovery of endoplasmic reticulum (a Latin for \\"fishnet\\"). In 1949, he became Director of the Jules Bordet Institute for Cancer Research and Treatment (Institut Jules Bordet) and Professor at the Faculty of Medicine of the Free University of Brussels, where he was Emeritus in 1971. In the mid sixties during an Electron Microscopy symposium in (Bratislava)-(Czechoslovakia) organized by the (UNESCO) at the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, he meets young scientist Dr. Emil Mrena who was at that time head of the Electron Microscopy department. He invited him to come and work with him in Brussels, making it possible for Dr. Mrena's family to escape the communist regime. Their close collaboration gave fruition to 5 publications from 1969 to 1974. With the support of his colleague and friend Christian de Duve, he became in 1972 Professor at the University of Louvain (Universit√© catholique de Louvain) and Director of the \\"Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire et Canc√©rologie\\" in Louvain-la-Neuve where he moved with Dr. Emil Mrena as sole collaborator. At the same time, he was appointed Professor at the Rockefeller University, an institution with which he had remained connected, in different degrees, since 1929. Personal life He married Julia Gilder in 1935, with whom he had a daughter Philippa. They got divorced while at Rockefeller. Philippa became a neuroscientist and married Antony Stretton. Claude was known to be a bit of an eccentric and had close friendship with painters, including Diego Rivera and Paul Delvaux, and musicians such as Edgard Var√®se. After his retirement in 1971 from the Universit√© libre de Bruxelles and from the directorship of the Institut Jules Bordet, he continued his research at the University of Louvain with his collaborator Dr. Emil Mrena, who ended up resigning in 1977 due to decreasing activity of the Laboratory, moving to other research works. It is said that he continued his research in seclusion until he died of natural causes, at his home in Brussels, on Sunday night on 22 May 1983, but he had stopped visiting his own laboratory in Louvain already in 1976 due to his weak health.

The novel is set in Gardner's \\"League of Peoples's\\" futuristic universe, and plays out in the small, isolated village of Tober Cove. Set on post-apocalyptic Earth, Tober Cove most resembles a rural, seventeenth century fishing village, with one exception: every year, everyone below the age of 21 changes gender. At the age of twenty-one, the people of the village must \\"commit\\" to being male, female or both in the form of a Hermaphrodite (a 'Neut'), forever. Commitment Hour follows the day leading up to the main character's hour of commitment. Tober Cove's society revolves around gender. Dualistic in structure, there is a matriarch and a patriarch, both of whom command equal - but different - power within the community. The patriarch is the head of the city council and the military, which also serves as the town's police force. The matriarch runs the town's health services, a vital role in a society without modern medicine. Tasks within the community are largely gender determined: men are warriors, fishermen, carpenters etc. and women are seamstresses, craft-makers, food preparers etc. Thus, in Tober Cove, choosing a gender is akin to choosing a life. Throughout the book, the main character addresses some of the more obvious questions, and to him more silly questions people from outside the Cove ask. When asked 'which sex is better,' the main character explains that the answer varies from person to person. Of course, if being male was better, or vice versa, the population of Tober Cove would be overwhelmingly one sided. Since it wasn't, you could say that both sexes had equal advantages and disadvantages. Of course, making love to someone from Tober Cove was always better, since they knew what felt good for both sexes. Tober Cove's religion also revolves around gender. The residents believe that the gods granted the people of their town the special privilege of choosing their sex, and that every year the gods come to collect their children and change their genders. The fact that the \\"gods\\" that descended into the town's harbor every year are stylized planes doesn't bother the residents. They simply believed that the gods used many devices as their instruments. Tober Cove exists in a post- apocalyptic Earth. Earth is post apocalyptic in the sense that, when the \\"League of Peoples\\" offered humanity technological advance in exchange for the promise never to kill other sentient creatures, most of the population of Earth accepted and left the planet. Those who remained were those who wouldn't, or couldn't accept the League's offer. As Earth's population departed, the planet descended into chaos. The book takes place about 400 years after this great exodus, and while some technology still exists, most has fallen in ruin. Tober Cove is a small, rural, technologically undeveloped town that is unique in the galaxy. Spark Lords rule Earth with super-advanced technology. Clad in indestructible armor, with access to the galaxy's latest gadgetry, Spark Lords maintain absolute control over Earth. Charged by the League with maintaining law and order on Earth, they content themselves with preventing major conflicts. They generally stay out of local affairs, and, to the knowledge of Cove residents, no Spark Lord has ever visited Tober Cove. Much of the plot of the novel is driven by the arrival in Tober Cove of the Science Spark Lord to observe the gender-changing ceremony. Reception At Tor.com, Jo Walton declared that the best thing about the novel was Fullin's voice, which she described as \\"confident confiding first person\\"; she also stated that the most interesting thing was Fullin's belief \\"that he's living in a low tech fantasy world, full of gods and magic and rituals and taboos, when in fact it's quite clear to the reader as the story goes on that this is a post-technological, indeed, post-singularity society\\", and emphasized that the culture of Tober Cove is \\"very sophisticated\\" and \\"very Canadian\\".Post apocalyptic gender-bending: James Alan Gardner‚Äôs Commitment Hour, by Jo Walton, at Tor.com; published October 12, 2010; retrieved June 18, 2017 The SF Site's Donna McMahon considered it to be \\"engaging, entertaining, funny and very well written\\", faulting it only in that she found it unlikely that, \\"in a society with very rigid traditional gender roles, the sex ratio would end up around 50-50 even if each person was given a completely free choice\\" ‚Äî and in that she felt Gardner \\"has never lived in a fishing village\\" and therefore \\"didn't capture the feel of a fish-guts-stinking rural subsistence economy\\".Commitment Hour, by James Alan Gardner, reviewed by Donna McMahon, at the SF Site; published 2001; retrieved June 18, 2017 Conversely, at Quill and Quire, Crawford Kilian compared it negatively to Ursula K.

The group's name was inspired by the 1968 film The Killing of Sister George, which was an adaptation of the play of the same name. Although queercore bands had existed in the UK in the 1980s, such as The Apostles/Academy 23, and No Brain Cells and in the early 1990s, such as Tongue Man, Sister George brought queercore into the spotlight there. The members were Lisa Cook on bass, Daryl Stanislaw on drums, Lyndon Holmes on guitar and vocals, and Ellyott on lead vocals and guitar; Ellyott was the main singer and song writer of Israeli band Pollyanna Frank, one of Israel's most important alternative bands; she was also drummer of The Darlings, a band which included Lesley Woods, formerly of the post punk band Au Pairs, and Debbie Smith, later in Curve and Echobelly. Their album, Drag King, came out on Catcall Records, which was run by Liz Naylor. \\\\- Gale Document Number: CJ170793462 The band found themselves heralded in the pages of British music magazines such as the NME. They toured with acts like Huggy Bear and Hissyfit at first, but soon they were joined by other queer bands such as Mouthfull and Children's Hour, and it was these groups that pioneered queercore in the UK. Their album was rereleased in the U.S. by Outpunk Records, and a music video for the song \\"Handle Bar\\" was made. This song also appeared on the Outpunk Records compilation, Outpunk Dance Party. Also featured on Drag King was a hardcore style cover of the Tom Robinson song \\"Glad to Be Gay\\". The Sister George version featured the voice of serial killer Aileen Wuornos, and the band chanting, \\"We kill in self defence\\". In a gig in London's club v, the alternative queer club, in the mid '90s, Robinson introduced his song by saying, \\"I'm now going to sing a Sister George cover\\". Label owner Naylor said of the band's relation to mainstream gay culture, \\"To me, the gay lifestyle is getting to be like just another alternative lifestyle. You go down Old Compton Street in Soho and see them sitting there in nice coffee bars with their pink pounds - and these (Sister George) are 20-year-old kids who are angry and on the dole.\\" The band broke up in the midst of recording their second album. Afterwards, Ellyott went on to form Nightnurse which featured then 16-year-old Charlotte Hatherley on guitar, who would later have success with the band Ash. Daryl drummed for The Element Of Crime with Chris and Jo from Huggy Bear, Layla from Skinned Teen, Dale from Blood Sausage and Andy from Linus, releasing the single \\"The things we do for love...\\". Sister George performed in and are interviewed in the film She's Real, Worse Than Queer by Lucy Thane. Ellyott was interviewed for the book Never Mind the Bollocks: Women Rewrite Rock by Amy Raphael (Virago Press, 1995).

Courage is required to take action when one has doubts or fears about the consequences. Moral courage therefore involves deliberation or careful thought. Reflex action or dogmatic fanaticism do not involve moral courage because such impulsive actions are not based upon moral reasoning. Moral courage may also require physical courage when the consequences are punishment or other bodily peril. Moral courage has been seen as the exemplary modernist form of courage.T. A. Shippey, The Road to Middle Earth (1992) pp. 72‚Äì73 Parenting approach Parenting with the incorporation of moral courage can have an effect on the self-expression of the child during late adolescence. The development of moral courage within parenting is not only affected by the parent's passed down moral values but the children's autonomy on how to perceive and practice their moral values. Those who incorporate the practice of their morals values into their everyday lives engage in moral courage to protect those values as well. Examples of moral courage=Discrimination As an example, moral courage can be shown through selfless actions aimed to diminish or eliminate discrimination. A research study was performed using qualitative research methods to analyze the process of how and why individuals become LGBT allies. The study mentions how human resources development play a role to help prevent LGBT discrimination in the workplace.

An Essay on Man is a poem published by Alexander Pope in 1733‚Äì1734. It was dedicated to Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke, (pronounced 'Bull-en-brook') hence the opening line: \\"Awake, St John...\\". via Google books via Google books via Google books It is an effort to rationalize or rather \\"vindicate the ways of God to man\\" (l.16), a variation of John Milton's claim in the opening lines of Paradise Lost, that he will \\"justify the ways of God to men\\" (1.26). It is concerned with the natural order God has decreed for man. Because man cannot know God's purposes, he cannot complain about his position in the Great Chain of Being (ll.33-34) and must accept that \\"Whatever IS, is RIGHT\\" (l.292), a theme that was satirized by Voltaire in Candide (1759).Candide, or Optimism. Review of the Burton Raffel translation by the Yale UP. More than any other work, it popularized optimistic philosophy throughout England and the rest of Europe. Pope's Essay on Man and Moral Epistles were designed to be the parts of a system of ethics which he wanted to express in poetry. Moral Epistles has been known under various other names including Ethic Epistles and Moral Essays. On its publication, An Essay on Man received great admiration throughout Europe. Voltaire called it \\"the most beautiful, the most useful, the most sublime didactic poem ever written in any language\\".Voltaire, Lettres Philosophiques, amended 1756 edition, cited in the Appendix (p.147) of Philosophical Letters (Letters Concerning the English Nation), Courier Dover Publications 2003, , accessed on Google Books 2014-02-12 In 1756 Rousseau wrote to Voltaire admiring the poem and saying that it \\"softens my ills and brings me patience\\". Kant was fond of the poem and would recite long passages from it to his students.Harry M Solomon: The rape of the text: reading and misreading Pope's Essay on man on Google Books Later however, Voltaire renounced his admiration for Pope's and Leibniz's optimism and even wrote a novel, Candide, as a satire on their philosophy of ethics. Rousseau also critiqued the work, questioning \\"Pope's uncritical assumption that there must be an unbroken chain of being all the way from inanimate matter up to God.\\" The essay, written in heroic couplets, comprises four epistles. Pope began work on it in 1729, and had finished the first three by 1731. They appeared in early 1733, with the fourth epistle published the following year. The poem was originally published anonymously; Pope did not admit authorship until 1735. Pope reveals in his introductory statement, \\"The Design\\", that An Essay on Man was originally conceived as part of a longer philosophical poem which would have been expanded on through four separate books. According to his friend and editor, William Warburton, Pope intended to structure the work as follows: The four epistles which had already been published would have comprised the first book. The second book was to contain another set of epistles, which in contrast to the first book would focus on subjects such as human reason, the practical and impractical aspects of varied arts and sciences, human talent, the use of learning, the science of the world, and wit, together with \\"a satire against the misapplication\\" of those same disciplines. The third book would discuss politics and religion, while the fourth book was concerned with \\"private ethics\\" or \\"practical morality.\\" The following passage, taken from the first two paragraphs of the opening verse of the second epistle, is often quoted by those familiar with Pope's work, as it neatly summarizes some of the religious and humanistic tenets of the poem: In the above example, Pope's thesis is that man has learnt about nature and God's creation through science; consequently, science has given man power, but having become intoxicated by this power, man has begun to think that he is \\"imitating God\\". In response, Pope declares the species of man to be a \\"fool\\", absent of knowledge and plagued by \\"ignorance\\" in spite of all the progress achieved through science. Pope argues that humanity should make a study of itself, and not debase the spiritual essence of the world with earthly science, since the two are diametrically opposed to one another: man should \\"presume not God to scan\\".

Bowie later went on to say about his cover album, The Life Aquatic Studio Sessions, that \\"had Seu Jorge not recorded my songs in Portuguese I would never have heard this new level of beauty which he has imbued them with.\\" In June 2006, he performed at Bonnaroo music festival in Manchester, Tennessee and at the Festival Sudoeste TMN in Portugal. He has also performed in 2006 at the Bluesfest in Ottawa, Ontario and performed at the Harbourfront in Toronto, Ontario. Jorge's performances are known for their excitement as well as for getting the crowd moving. In January 2010 he performed with Thievery Corporation at the Austin City Limits. His album 'Am√©rica Brasil' had a limited Brazilian release in 2007 under his label Cafun√© Gravadora, distributed in the UK by Proper Music Distribution.

In 1847 he discarded his title of nobility. He later emigrated to the United States and became a general in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Early life and career Willich was born in Braunsberg, Province of East Prussia. His father, a captain of hussars during the Napoleonic Wars,Faust, page 555. died when Willich was three years old. With an elder brother, Willich found a home in the family of Friedrich Schleiermacher, a theologian, whose wife was a distant relative. He received a military education at Potsdam and Berlin. Initially an officer in the Prussian Army, serving in the 7th (1st Westphalian) Field Artillery Regiment,:de:1. Westf√§lisches Feldartillerie-Regiment Nr. 7 he resigned from the army in 1846 as a convinced republican. Willich was not the only republican emerging from that regiment. One of his fellow officers in M√ºnster and Wesel was Fritz Anneke, who also was to become a revolutionary commander in Palatinate 1849 and later a commander in the Union Army. Willich tendered his resignation from the army in a letter written in such terms that, instead of its being accepted, he was arrested and tried by a court-martial. He was acquitted and was permitted to resign. With Karl Schapper, he was the leader of the left faction of the Communist League. He took an active part in the Revolutions of 1848‚Äì49. In 1849, he was leader of a Free Corps in the Baden- Palatinate uprising. Revolutionary thinker Friedrich Engels served as his aide-de-camp. Among his revolutionary friends were Franz Sigel, Friedrich Hecker, Louis Blenker, and Carl Schurz. After the suppression of the uprising, he emigrated to London via Switzerland. He had learned the trade of a carpenter while in England, and so earned his livelihood. In 1850, when the League of Communists split, he (together with Schapper) was leader of the anti-Karl Marx grouping. In London, Willich became an associate of the French revolutionary and political exile Emmanuel Barth√©lemy. According to Wilhelm Liebknecht, Willich and Barth√©lemy plotted to kill Karl Marx for being too conservative. Willich publicly insulted Marx and challenged him to a duel, which Marx refused to fight. Instead Willich was challenged by a young associate of Marx, Konrad Schramm. The pistol duel was fought in Belgium with Barth√©lemy acting as Willich's second; Schramm was wounded but survived the encounter. Barth√©lemy was hanged in London in 1855 after shooting and killing his employer and another man.Biographical note in the Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 10 (New York: International Publishers, 1978) p. 711. Coming to the United States in 1853, Willich first found employment at his trade in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Here his attainments in mathematics and other scientific studies were soon discovered, and he found more congenial work in the coastal survey. In 1858, he was induced to go to Cincinnati as editor of the German Republican, a German-language free labor newspaper, which he continued until the opening of the Civil War in 1861. Willich became known as one of the \\"Ohio Hegelians\\" (followers of German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel), along with John Bernhard Stallo, Moncure Daniel Conway, and Peter Kaufmann. Civil War With the outbreak of the Civil War in early 1861, Willich actively recruited German immigrants in the southwestern Ohio region. He joined the 9th Ohio Infantry (\\"Die Neuner\\") as regimental adjutant with the rank of first lieutenant, and was promoted to major in August of that year. He served in western Virginia, seeing action at the Battle of Rich Mountain, as well as at Carnifex Ferry. Willich then returned to the Ohio River valley over the winter and resumed his recruiting activities. Governor Oliver P. Morton commissioned Willich a colonel of the 32nd Indiana Infantry Regiment, also called the First German, (an all-German regiment). At the request of Governor Oliver P. Morton, he assumed command of the Thirty-second Indiana. Willich drilled his regiment, in German, to a high degree of professionalism. It made a favorable impression wherever it served. An innovative officer, he suggested construction of special wagons convertible to pontoon boats by removal of wheels. To speed up troop movement and assure combat condition of troops upon arrival on the battlefield, he recommended wagon transport of troops. His superiors rejected both ideas. Yet, Willich's concern for his men's well-being earned him the nickname \\"Papa\\". When possible, he ordered bakery ovens constructed so that troops would have fresh bread. The 32nd gained nationwide recognition for its stand against Confederate forces at Rowlett's Station, Kentucky. A detachment of 500 men under Lt. Col. Henry von Trebra fought off 1,300 men of Terry's Texas Rangers and infantry under General Hindman. The 32nd formed the \\"hollow square\\", and drove the attackers back, losing 10 troopers and 22 wounded, but killing 33 of the enemy, including Col. Terry, and wounding fifty others. The 32nd saw action at Shiloh on the second day, during which Col. Willich displayed great leadership. When his troops became unsteady under fire, he stood before them, his back to the enemy, and conducted the regiment through the manual of arms. He had the regimental band play \\"La Marseillaise\\", the anthem for all republican movements in Europe. Recovering its stability, the 32nd launched a bayonet attack. Afterwards Willich was given command of the Horn Brigade. The 32nd remained in his brigade, under command of von Trebra and, later, Frank Erdelmeyer. Rewarded by a promotion to brigadier general of volunteers in July 1862, Willich fought at the Battle of Perryville under Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell in Kentucky. He commanded the 1st Brigade, 2nd Division, XIV Corps in December at the Battle of Stones River. He was captured by the Confederates when his horse was shot out from under him. He was sent to Libby Prison for four months, but was paroled and exchanged in May 1863. Returning to the federal army later that year, he was assigned to command of the 1st Brigade, 2nd Division, XX Corps and served with distinction during the Tullahoma Campaign, where his brigade played a key role in holding Liberty Gap. He led a division at the Battle of Chickamauga and saw additional action during the Chattanooga Campaign. During the Siege of Chattanooga, the 32nd played a conspicuous part, as Willich's Brigade captured Orchard Knob. Despite only having orders to clear the base of the ridge, Willich ordered the assault up Missionary Ridge that routed the Confederate forces, breaking the siege and clearing the way for the invasion of Georgia.Wiley Sword, Mountains Touched with Fire; Chattanooga Besieged, 1863, New York: St. Martin's Press, 1995, pp. 277, 295. The 32nd Indiana and the 6th Ohio were the first to reach the top. The 32nd participated in the Atlanta Campaign with General William Tecumseh Sherman. Before the fall of Atlanta, the 32nd was pulled back and sent via Nashville, Tennessee to Indianapolis. En route, the 32nd was assigned to counter Confederate guerrilla forces in Kentucky. After three days fighting, the 32nd returned to Indianapolis. Willich, who had been wounded at Resaca, Georgia, was promoted to brevet major general and put in command of Cincinnati. Due to the anti-German sentiment in the nation, and the army in particular, veterans of the 32nd did not re-enlist. Nor did most other all- German regiments. It rankled the German-American soldier that General Joseph Hooker had blamed German troops of the 11th Corps for his defeat at Chancellorsville. The New York Times labeled the 11th Corps \\"Dutch cowards.\\" Actually, of the corps's 12,000 men, 7,000 were American. Of the remaining 5,000, only one-third were German, these having been the units offering the stiffest resistance to the Confederate attack made by Stonewall Jackson. In 1864, Willich led his brigade through Tennessee and Georgia during the Atlanta Campaign. He suffered a severe wound in the Battle of Resaca that forced him to leave the field. For the rest of the war, he served in various administrative roles, commanding Union posts in Cincinnati, Covington, Kentucky, and Newport, Kentucky. He received a brevet promotion to major general of US Volunteers on October 21, 1865, then resigned from the army to return to civilian life. The three-year veterans were mustered out on September 7, 1864. The remaining 200 replacements whose terms had not expired were organized into a battalion of four companies under Hans Blume. At war's end they were stationed with General Sheridan's occupation forces in central Texas. They returned to Indianapolis and were mustered out on December 4, 1865. Postbellum career After the war, Willich returned to Cincinnati and went into government service. He held a series of responsible positions, including auditor of Hamilton County. His home at 1419 Main Street still stands in Cincinnati.http://www.artsci.uc.edu/german/about/germanamerican/map.html In 1870, he returned to Germany, offering his services to the Prussian army during the Franco-Prussian War. His age, health, and communist views caused him to be refused, however. He stayed in Germany long enough to receive a college degree in philosophy, graduating from the University of Berlin at the age of sixty.Faust, page 556. Returning to the United States, he died in St. Marys, Ohio, and was buried there in Elmgrove Cemetery. In his concluding note to the Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial in Cologne, Marx wrote: \\"In the Civil War in North America, Willich showed that he is more than a visionary\\".

Christian. It was first published in 2003 () by Green Candy Press; the book is introduced by Cecilia Tan. It was republished in 2010 by Circlet Press () with a new foreword by Kit O'Connell. The stories take place in a wide variety of settings, with an assortment of themes and widely differing tone, from grim to humorous. There is also a wide variety of sexual acts depicted in the work, including many which are not possible with modern technology, involving a wide variety of partners in heterosexual, bisexual, homosexual and sometimes non-human couplings. Plot summaries Some of the short stories in this collection include, *\\"State\\", about a prostitute who is trained to behave like an expensive robot designed for sex. *\\"Bluebelle\\" is about a police officer and his police vehicle (for which the story is named). His vehicle is also his sex partner. *In \\"Winged Memory,\\" a prostitute wears \\"whoreware,\\" wearable computing equipment which includes a bracelet that charges cash cards and eyewear that cycles from green to red when a client's time is up. A man sells his memories (not unlike Strange Days)) in exchange for money to hire the prostitute. *\\"Eulogy\\" is set in a future where humans are effectively immortal. In the story, a woman wants to perform oral sex on a man with a rare illness which is still actually fatal because the participants are bored with eternal life and miss their deceased friend. *\\"Butterflie$\\" is the story of a computer hack which drains a victim's bank account while seducing them in virtual reality. * \\"Everything But the Smell of Lilies,\\" which concerns Justine, an expensive prostitute who has been surgically altered: thanks to extensive implants and modifications (such as rerouting of arteries and internal oxygen tanks), she can have her throat slit by a client who can then fulfill necrophilic fantasies on a body that can wake up again, save them from criminal charges, and collect a hefty fee. In this story, her pimp asks her to stage a distraction from a crime and act as a real victim, placing her in the hands of a paramedic with a taste for actual corpses. * Lines of sexual orientation are blurred in \\"Fully Accessorized, Baby,\\" where two women have sex, both using fully functional prosthetic penises (one also has a cybernetic arm made of teak). * \\"The New Motor\\" is erotic historical fiction about the spiritualist John Murray Spear and a mystical machine he is led to build. * \\"Guernica\\" depicts the behavior of BDSM enthusiasts in a dystopian future where only procreative heterosexual sex is legal. * \\"Hackwork\\" is about a future where a high-tech form of possession allows a woman to hire her body out for sexual pleasure to clients that will feel her every sensation remotely. * \\"Heartbreaker\\" is about a cyborg police woman who has a sexual encounter with an equally artificial criminal. * In \\"Switch\\", a woman is a prostitute for a sex club where the prostitutes' memories are erased at the end of each working day, allowing them to cater to extremely private clientele. *\\"Intercore\\" is about a futuristic amateur pornography photography session. * An example of the humor in the volume occurs in \\"Technophile,\\" which opens with the line, \\"I almost lost my virginity at fifteen, but his batteries ran low.\\" It is about a young man whose attempts at his first sexual encounter with another man is made more awkward when he discovers that his lover's cybernetic genitalia is incompatible with the wiring in his home. * \\"Skin-Effect\\" concerns two android lovers, one of whom is a soldier that has been completely replaced by artificial, robotic parts.

Wilson is best known for his expertise on the life and writings of John C. Calhoun, having recently compiled all his papers in twenty-eight volumes. He has been the M.E. Bradford Distinguished Chair of the Abbeville Institute, an adjunct faculty member of the paleolibertarian Ludwig von Mises Institute, and an affiliated scholar of the League of the South Institute, the research arm of the League of the South. In 1994 Wilson was an original founder of the League of the South, which advocates a \\"natural societal order of superiors and subordinates\\", using as an example, \\"Christ is the head of His Church; husbands are the heads of their families; parents are placed over their children; employers rank above their employees; the teacher is superior to his students, etc.\\" The League of the South has been described as a white supremacist and white nationalist organization.  Early life and education  Clyde Norman Wilson was born on June 11, 1941 in Greensboro, North Carolina, where he was raised. His father, Clyde Sr., a fireman, was a leader in the state Firefighters Union and was chosen to train and command the first African-American fire company in Greensboro. Clyde Jr. was editor of the Greensboro High School newspaper in his senior year, receiving a special commendation from the Columbia University Scholastic Press Association for editorial writing. During that year, 1958‚Äì1959, the high school was the first in North Carolina to be integrated. Wilson received the B.A. at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1963 and the M.A. in 1964. While still a student he published journalism in the Greensboro Daily News, the Greensboro Record, the Winston-Salem Journal, and the Chapel Hill Weekly, and wrote a regular column for the campus Daily Tar Heel. From 1964 he spent several years as a reporter for the Richmond News Leader and the Charlotte News, covering police, courts, and other matters. In 1971 Wilson received the Ph.D. in History from the University of North Carolina. While a graduate student he published articles in such historical journals as The North Carolina Historical Review and Civil War Times, and in opinion journals like Modern Age, Intercollegiate Review, and National Review.  Career  Wilson became Assistant Professor of History at the University of South Carolina in 1971; Associate Professor, 1977; Professor, 1983. In 1977 he became editor of The Papers of John C. Calhoun, producing volumes 10 through the completion of the edition with volume 28 in 2003. Scholarly reviewers were unanimous in high praise for the Calhoun Papers for meticulous editorial work, insightful historical introductions, and steady progress. The term \\"exemplary\\" was often applied. Wilson's work on Calhoun drew comments like \\"shows high ability in the field of intellectual history\\" (Journal of American History), \\"plows new ground by the acre\\" (Virginia Magazine of History & Biography), and many others of similar import. During 32 years at the University of South Carolina, Wilson taught a wide variety of courses and directed 16 doctoral dissertations, four of which quickly became books. Wilson early identified himself as an intellectual heir of Richard Weaver and the Southern Agrarians. In 1980 he assisted Thomas Fleming in founding Southern Partisan magazine, and subsequently became a contributing editor of Chronicles when Fleming became editor of that journal. In 1981, Wilson brought together the book Why the South Will Survive, by Fifteen Southerners, a restatement of the Agrarian message of I'll Take My Stand on its fiftieth anniversary. The volume included contributions by Cleanth Brooks, Andrew Lytle, George Garrett, and other well- known literati. In 1993 he was active in the formation of the League of the South and served on its board of directors for the first ten years. He has stated reasons for his role in creation of the League, alleging that it was necessary to preserve the unique features of southern culture and to promote devolution from an over-centralized U.S. government. The Southern Poverty Law Center has listed Wilson among the \\"ideologues\\" of the neo-Confederate movement, stating that he told Gentleman's Quarterly in 1998 that \\"We don't want the federal government telling us what to do, pushing integration down our throats... We're tired of carpetbagging professionals coming to our campuses and teaching that the South is a cultural wasteland.\\" Condemning what he perceives as a positive representation of people of color in the media, Wilson lamented that the \\"established forces of 'American' society have been promoting the glory of the non-white and the foreign for two generations now.\\" In a 2007 article addressing a debate exchange between presidential candidates Ron Paul and Rudy Giuliani, Wilson condemned the Voting Rights Act of 1965, writing:  Published work  Wilson has contributed more than 400 articles, essays, and reviews to a wide variety of academic and popular books and publications. He has lectured extensively across the U.S. to scholarly, heritage, and political groups. Books include Carolina Cavalier: The Life and Mind of James Johnston Pettigrew, an American Civil War biography that has gone through three editions; From Union to Empire: Essays in the Jeffersonian Tradition; and Defending Dixie: Essays in Southern History and Culture. In addition, he has contributed to a number of influential books, including The New Right Papers, (Robert W. Whitaker, Ed.).WhitakerOnline.org He has edited a number of books, including three volumes of The Dictionary of Literary Biography on American historians; The Essential Calhoun; John C. Calhoun: A Bibliography; and A Defender of Southern Conservatism: M.E. Bradford and His Achievements. He has also written for Telos.\\"Up at the Fork of the Creek: In Search of American Populism\\". Telos number 104 (Summer 1995). New York. Wilson is recipient of the Bostick Medal for Contributions to South Carolina Letters, the first annual John Randolph Club Award for Lifetime Achievement, and the Sons of Confederate Veterans Medal of Meritorious Service. In 2005 he was the founding Dean of the Stephen D. Lee Institute, an educational arm of the Sons of Confederate Veterans.  References  External links  * Clyde N.

He composed it in 1725 in Leipzig for the feast of the Annunciation and led the first performance on 25 March 1725, which that year fell on Palm Sunday. Based on Philipp Nicolai's hymn \\"\\" (1599), it is one of Bach's chorale cantatas. Bach composed the cantata in his second year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, where the Marian feast was the only occasion during Lent when festive music was permitted. The theme of the hymn suits both the Annunciation and Palm Sunday occasions, in a spirit of longing expectation of an arrival. An unknown poet retained, as usual for the chorale cantatas of Bach's second cantata cycle, the hymn's first and last stanzas unchanged but paraphrased the themes of the inner stanzas to a sequence of alternating recitatives and arias. Bach scored the cantata for three vocal soloists, a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two horns, two oboes da caccia, two solo violins, strings and continuo. The chorale melody of Nicolai's hymn appears in the opening and closing choral movements of the cantata. All instruments play in the opening festive chorale fantasia, while the soprano carries the hymn tune and the lower voices answer in counterpoint of instrumental motifs. An oboe da caccia accents the first aria, the solo violins and strings return in the second aria, and an independent horn part crowns the closing chorale. Wie sch√∂n leuchtet der Morgenstern is the last chorale cantata of Bach's second cantata cycle, possibly because the librettist who provided the paraphrases for the middle movements of these cantatas was no longer available. The work was chosen to open the first attempt to publish Bach's complete works, a century after his death.  History and words  When Bach composed the cantata, he was in his second year as Thomaskantor, the director of church music in Leipzig. During his first year there, he had composed a cycle of cantatas for the occasions of the liturgical year that began on the first Sunday after Trinity 1723, and known as his first cantata cycle. In his second year he had composed a second cycle of cantatas that was planned to consist exclusively of chorale cantatas based on Lutheran hymns. is based on Philipp Nicolai's \\"\\" (1599). The hymn in seven stanzas was associated with Epiphany but also with the Annunciation. Leipzig celebrated several Marian feasts, including Annunciation on 25 March. In 1725 it fell on Palm Sunday. Annunciation was the only occasion for festive music during Lent, when Leipzig observed tempus clausum (silent time). The prescribed readings for the feast day are Isaiah's prophecy of the birth of the Messiah () and from the Gospel of Luke, the angel Gabriel announcing the birth of Jesus (). The unknown librettist retained the first and last stanzas of the hymn and paraphrased the other stanzas as recitatives and arias, using the second stanza for the first recitative, the third stanza for the first aria, the fourth stanza and part of the fifth for the second recitative, and the sixth stanza for the second aria. The hymn, expressing the longing for the arrival of the Saviour, can be connected to Jesus' birth being announced to Mary. The theme of arrival was also fitting for Palm Sunday, when the arrival of Jesus in Jerusalem is celebrated. The Bach scholar Alfred D√ºrr notes: \\"The librettist must be credited with the empathy he shows for that fervour which characterizes Nicolai's poem and which has made his hymns into an enduring possession of the Protestant Church.\\" While the name of the librettist, a \\"poetically and theologically competent specialist\\" is not known, scholars have suggested Andreas St√ºbel (1653‚Äì1725), a former headmaster of the Thomasschule. Bach led the first performance of the cantata on 25 March 1725. turned out to be the last chorale cantata Bach composed in his second cantata cycle. If St√ºbel was the librettist, his death in January 1725 explains that Bach lacked a competent collaborator. The composer returned to other texts for the remaining liturgical time of Easter, Pentecost and Trinity. The completion of the cycle of chorale cantatas meant so much to him that he included the early chorale cantata for Easter , and in years to come added a few chorale cantatas for occasions that were missing. was chosen by the Bach-Gesellschaft to begin the first volume of Bach's complete works, which the society started in 1850, a century after Bach's death. It was later listed as BWV 1 in the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis.  Music  The hymn tune with which Nicolai published his \\"Wie sch√∂n leuchtet der Morgenstern\\" chorale, Zahn No. 8359, in 1599, was over 60 years older than the hymn.C. Sanford Terry: \\"A Note on the Tune, \\", The Musical Times, Vol. 58, No. 893 (1 July 1917), pp. 302‚Äì303.  Scoring and structure  Bach structured the cantata in six movements. The text and tune of the hymn are kept in the outer choral movements, a chorale fantasia and a four-part closing chorale, which frame a sequence of alternating recitatives and arias. Bach scored the work for three vocal soloists (soprano (S), tenor (T) and bass (B)), a four-part choir, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two horns (Co), two oboes da caccia (Oc), two violins (Vl), two obbligato violins (Vs), viola (Va) and basso continuo. A festive scoring like this, including brass, was usually performed on holidays. The duration of the cantata is given as 25 minutes. In the following table of the movements, the scoring follows the Neue Bach-Ausgabe. The keys and time signatures are taken from Alfred D√ºrr, using the symbol for common time (4/4). The continuo, playing throughout, is not shown.  Movements  The scoring provides a rich orchestration. The sparkle of the morning star is illustrated by two solo violins, first in the first chorus, and reappearing with the other strings in the second aria. The sound of the oboe da caccia returns in the first aria. The horn sound returns in the closing chorale, with the second horn enriching the texture of the four-part setting by an independent line. The scoring is reminiscent of , written for Epiphany. Bach would later use the pair of horns in Part IV of his Christmas Oratorio, dealing with the naming of Jesus as announced to Mary. These works are all set in F major, observed by the musicologist Julian Mincham to be a key of \\"personal and contemplative\\" joy, compared to the \\"rousing, communal, major, sharp-key\\" joy of the opening chorus of the Christmas Oratorio, for example. = 1 = First publication of the hymn in Nicolai's 1599 Frewdenspiegel de√ü ewigen Lebens The , \\"\\" (How beautifully the morning star shines), in the chorale fantasia of the opening chorus is sung by the sopranos. The orchestra, with the two solo violins illustrating the sparkle of the morning star, plays independently and festively. Bach achieves \\"unusual animation\\" by setting the hymn not in common time but 12/8. John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000, notes that the movement begins intimately with a phrase of the second solo violin, answered by other instruments together and echoed individually, preparing the entrance of the soprano. The lower voices counter the cantus firmus with a version of the theme heard at the beginning in the solo violin. In further lines, the lower voices even enter first in their counterpoint, preparing the chorale tune entry. One phrase stands out as composed in chordal writing: \\"\\" (loving, friendly). = 2 = The tenor expresses in secco recitative the belief \\"\\" (You, very son of God and Mary). = 3 = In the first aria, the soprano renders \\"\\" (Fill utterly, you divine celestial flames), accompanied by an obbligato oboe da caccia, an instrument in alto range. The instruments illustrate the celestial flames in coloraturas. = 4 = In another secco recitative, the bass contrasts earthly light (\\"\\" (An earthly flash, a corporeal light does not stir my soul)) with heavenly light, illustrated by a melisma on both \\"\\" (joyful radiance) and \\"\\" (refreshment). = 5 = The two solo violins return from the first movement, accompanying with the other strings the tenor in the second aria, an expression of thanks and praise, \\"\\" (Our mouths and the tones of strings). The song of praise is intensified by a dance-like motion, called a \\"graceful minuet pulse\\" by the Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann. The voice has to master coloraturas on the repeated word \\"Gesang\\" (singing). = 6 = The closing chorale, \\"\\" (How earnestly glad I am indeed), is embellished by an independent part of the second horn, while the other instruments double the voices. Thus, the last chorale cantata in the second cantata cycle reaches an \\"air of baroque festive splendour\\".  Manuscripts and publication  While the autograph score has not survived, copies of the vocal and instrumental parts are extant, and held by the Bach Archive in Leipzig. The title reads: \\"Festo Annunciationis / Mariae / Wie sch√∂n leuchtet der Morgenstern / √¢ / 4. Voc. / 2. Corn. / 2. Hautbois. / 2. Violini Concert. / 2.

Unlike classical control and classification problems, the solutions are complex and must be discovered and optimized in multidimensional space. Planning is also related to decision theory. In known environments with available models, planning can be done offline. Solutions can be found and evaluated prior to execution. In dynamically unknown environments, the strategy often needs to be revised online. Models and policies must be adapted. Solutions usually resort to iterative trial and error processes commonly seen in artificial intelligence. These include dynamic programming, reinforcement learning and combinatorial optimization. Languages used to describe planning and scheduling are often called action languages.  Overview  Given a description of the possible initial states of the world, a description of the desired goals, and a description of a set of possible actions, the planning problem is to synthesize a plan that is guaranteed (when applied to any of the initial states) to generate a state which contains the desired goals (such a state is called a goal state). The difficulty of planning is dependent on the simplifying assumptions employed. Several classes of planning problems can be identified depending on the properties the problems have in several dimensions. * Are the actions deterministic or nondeterministic? For nondeterministic actions, are the associated probabilities available? * Are the state variables discrete or continuous? If they are discrete, do they have only a finite number of possible values? * Can the current state be observed unambiguously? There can be full observability and partial observability. * How many initial states are there, finite or arbitrarily many? * Do actions have a duration? * Can several actions be taken concurrently, or is only one action possible at a time? * Is the objective of a plan to reach a designated goal state, or to maximize a reward function? * Is there only one agent or are there several agents? Are the agents cooperative or selfish? Do all of the agents construct their own plans separately, or are the plans constructed centrally for all agents? The simplest possible planning problem, known as the Classical Planning Problem, is determined by: * a unique known initial state, * durationless actions, * deterministic actions, * which can be taken only one at a time, * and a single agent. Since the initial state is known unambiguously, and all actions are deterministic, the state of the world after any sequence of actions can be accurately predicted, and the question of observability is irrelevant for classical planning. Further, plans can be defined as sequences of actions, because it is always known in advance which actions will be needed. With nondeterministic actions or other events outside the control of the agent, the possible executions form a tree, and plans have to determine the appropriate actions for every node of the tree. Discrete-time Markov decision processes (MDP) are planning problems with: * durationless actions, * nondeterministic actions with probabilities, * full observability, * maximization of a reward function, * and a single agent. When full observability is replaced by partial observability, planning corresponds to partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). If there are more than one agent, we have multi-agent planning, which is closely related to game theory.  Domain independent planning  In AI planning, planners typically input a domain model (a description of a set of possible actions which model the domain) as well as the specific problem to be solved specified by the initial state and goal, in contrast to those in which there is no input domain specified. Such planners are called \\"domain independent\\" to emphasis the fact that they can solve planning problems from a wide range of domains. Typical examples of domains are block stacking, logistics, workflow management, and robot task planning. Hence a single domain independent planner can be used to solve planning problems in all these various domains. On the other hand, a route planner is typical of a domain specific planner.  Planning domain modelling languages  The most commonly used languages for representing planning domains and specific planning problems, such as STRIPS and PDDL for Classical Planning, are based on state variables. Each possible state of the world is an assignment of values to the state variables, and actions determine how the values of the state variables change when that action is taken. Since a set of state variables induce a state space that has a size that is exponential in the set, planning, similarly to many other computational problems, suffers from the curse of dimensionality and the combinatorial explosion. An alternative language for describing planning problems is that of hierarchical task networks, in which a set of tasks is given, and each task can be either realized by a primitive action or decomposed into a set of other tasks. This does not necessarily involve state variables, although in more realistic applications state variables simplify the description of task networks. Algorithms for planning=Classical planning * forward chaining state space search, possibly enhanced with heuristics * backward chaining search, possibly enhanced by the use of state constraints (see STRIPS, graphplan) * partial-order planning  Reduction to other problems  * reduction to the propositional satisfiability problem (satplan). * reduction to Model checking - both are essentially problems of traversing state spaces, and the classical planning problem corresponds to a subclass of model checking problems. Temporal planning Temporal planning can be solved with methods similar to classical planning. The main difference is, because of the possibility of several, temporally overlapping actions with a duration being taken concurrently, that the definition of a state has to include information about the current absolute time and how far the execution of each active action has proceeded. Further, in planning with rational or real time, the state space may be infinite, unlike in classical planning or planning with integer time. Temporal planning is closely related to scheduling problems. Temporal planning can also be understood in terms of timed automata. Probabilistic planning Probabilistic planning can be solved with iterative methods such as value iteration and policy iteration, when the state space is sufficiently small. With partial observability, probabilistic planning is similarly solved with iterative methods, but using a representation of the value functions defined for the space of beliefs instead of states.  Preference-based planning  In preference-based planning, the objective is not only to produce a plan but also to satisfy user-specified preferences. A difference to the more common reward-based planning, for example corresponding to MDPs, preferences don't necessarily have a precise numerical value. Conditional planning Deterministic planning was introduced with the STRIPS planning system, which is a hierarchical planner. Action names are ordered in a sequence and this is a plan for the robot. Hierarchical planning can be compared with an automatic generated behavior tree. The disadvantage is, that a normal behavior tree is not so expressive like a computer program. That means, the notation of a behavior graph contains action commands, but no loops or if-then-statements. Conditional planning overcomes the bottleneck and introduces an elaborated notation which is similar to a control flow, known from other programming languages like Pascal. It is very similar to program synthesis, which means a planner generates sourcecode which can be executed by an interpreter. An early example of a conditional planner is ‚ÄúWarplan-C‚Äù which was introduced in the mid 1970s. What is the difference between a normal sequence and a complicated plan, which contains if-then-statements? It has to do with uncertainty at runtime of a plan. The idea is that a plan can react to sensor signals which are unknown for the planner. The planner generates two choices in advance. For example, if an object was detected, then action A is executed, if an object is missing, then action B is executed. A major advantage of conditional planning is the ability to handle partial plans. An agent is not forced to plan everything from start to finish but can divide the problem into chunks. This helps to reduce the state space and solves much more complex problems. = Contingent planning = We speak of \\"contingent planning\\" when the environment is observable through sensors, which can be faulty. It is thus a situation where the planning agent acts under incomplete information. For a contingent planning problem, a plan is no longer a sequence of actions but a decision tree because each step of the plan is represented by a set of states rather than a single perfectly observable state, as in the case of classical planning. The selected actions depend on the state of the system. For example, if it rains, the agent chooses to take the umbrella, and if it doesn't, they may choose not to take it. Mikael L. Littman showed in 1998 that with branching actions, the planning problem becomes EXPTIME-complete. A particular case of contiguous planning is represented by FOND problems - for \\"fully- observable and non-deterministic\\". If the goal is specified in LTLf (linear time logic on finite trace) then the problem is always EXPTIME-complete and 2EXPTIME-complete if the goal is specified with LDLf. = Conformant planning = Conformant planning is when the agent is uncertain about the state of the system, and it cannot make any observations. The agent then has beliefs about the real world, but cannot verify them with sensing actions, for instance. These problems are solved by techniques similar to those of classical planning, but where the state space is exponential in the size of the problem, because of the uncertainty about the current state. A solution for a conformant planning problem is a sequence of actions. Haslum and Jonsson have demonstrated that the problem of conformant planning is EXPSPACE-complete, and 2EXPTIME-complete when the initial situation is uncertain, and there is non- determinism in the actions outcomes.

DiLorenzo, a professor of economics at Loyola University Maryland, in 2002. He was severely critical of Lincoln's United States presidency. Summary DiLorenzo criticizes Lincoln for the suspension of habeas corpus, violations of the First Amendment, war crimes committed by generals in the American Civil War, and the expansion of government power. He argues that Lincoln's views on race exhibited forms of bigotry that are commonly overlooked today, such as belief in white racial superiority, against miscegenation, and even against black men being jurors. He says that Lincoln instigated the American Civil War not over slavery but rather to centralize power and to enforce the strongly protectionist Morrill Tariff; similarly, he criticizes Lincoln for his strong support of Henry Clay's American System economic plan. DiLorenzo regards Lincoln as the political and ideological heir of Alexander Hamilton, and contends that Lincoln achieved by the use of armed force the centralized state which Hamilton failed to create in the early years of the United States. DiLorenzo's negative view of Lincoln is explicitly derived from his anarcho- capitalist views. He considers Lincoln to have opened the way to later instances of government involvement in the American economy, for example Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, of which DiLorenzo strongly disapproves. DiLorenzo objects to historians who described Lincoln as having carried out \\"a capitalist revolution\\", since in DiLorenzo's view protectionist policies such as Lincoln strongly advocated and implemented \\"are not true Capitalism\\". In DiLorenzo's explicitly expressed view, only free trade policies are truly capitalist ‚Äìa distinction not shared by most economists and political scientists.[cite?] Also, DiLorenzo declares protectionism and mercantilism to be one the same, using the two as interchangeable and frequently talking of \\"Lincoln's Mercantilist policies\\". In general, academics do not regard protectionism and mercantilism as being identical ‚Äìat most regarding the two as having some common features.[cite?] In the Foreword to DiLorenzo's book, Walter E. Williams, a professor of economics at George Mason University, says that \\"Abraham Lincoln's direct statements indicated his support for slavery,\\" and adds that he \\"defended slave owners' right to own their property\\" by supporting the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. Reception  Herman Belz reviewed DiLorenzo's book together with Charles Adams's When in the Course of Human Events: Arguing the Case for Southern Secession, and claimed that it quoted Lincoln out of context, saying: He says they have a \\"simple-minded understanding of the relationship between politics and economics, between moral ends and productive entrepreneurial activity.\\" He also noted that \\"these not very scholarly books\\" were of most interest for \\"their reflection of recent trends in Civil War historiography. Two developments stand out. The first is radicalization of the interrelated issues of slavery, civil rights, and race relations. The second development is a revival of interest in secession as a solution to the problem of government centralization.\\" Reviewing for The Independent Review, Richard M. Gamble noted that DiLorenzo's book \\"manages to raise fresh and morally probing questions\\" and that it \\"exposes Lincoln's embarrassing views on race, his ambition for economic nationalism, his rewriting of the history of the founding of the nation, his cavalier violation of constitutional limits on the presidency, and his willingness to wage a barbaric total war to achieve his ends\\". But, Gamble notes that The Real Lincoln \\"is seriously compromised by careless errors of fact, misuse of sources, and faulty documentation,\\" which taken all together \\"constitute a near-fatal threat to DiLorenzo's credibility as a historian.\\" Gamble listed numerous fallacies of the book as follows: \\"Thomas Jefferson was not among the framers of the Constitution (pp. 69‚Äì70); Lincoln advised sending freed slaves to Liberia in a speech in 1854, not \\"during the war\\" (pp. 16‚Äì17); Lincoln was not a member of the Illinois state legislature in 1857 (p. 18); the commerce clause was not an \\"amendment,\\"; Thaddeus Stevens was a Pennsylvania representative, not a senator (p. 140); and Fort Sumter was not a customs house (p. 242).\\" Additionally: \\"In chapter 3, DiLorenzo claims that in a letter to Salmon P. Chase, Lincoln \\"admitted that the original [Emancipation] proclamation had no legal justification, except as a war measure\\" (p. 37). His source, however, is the recollections of a conversation (not a letter) that portrait artist Francis Bicknell Carpenter (not Chase) had with Lincoln, and at no point do these recollections sustain DiLorenzo's summary of them. Moreover, in the reference for this section, DiLorenzo misidentifies the title of his source as Paul Angle's The American Reader, when in fact the jumbled material comes from Angle's The Lincoln Reader.\\" He also notes that DiLorenzo claims, for example, \\"that in the four years between 1860 and 1864, population in the thirteen largest Northern cities rose by 70 percent\\" (p. 225).\\" Gamble checks the source and finds it says that total rate of growth took place over 15 years. Ken Masugi of the Claremont Institute wrote in National Review that \\"DiLorenzo frequently distorts the meaning of the primary sources he cites, Lincoln most of all.\\" }} Masugi provides the following example: Masugi further asserts that DiLorenzo failed to recognize \\"a disunited America might have become prey for the designs of European imperial powers, which would have put an end to the experiment in self- government.\\" DiLorenzo responded saying that Masugi was selective in his presentation about Lincoln and \\"relies entirely on a few of Lincoln's prettier speeches, ignoring his less attractive ones as well as his actual behavior.\\" He concluded that Lincoln used his considerable rhetorical skills to camouflage his true intentions and mask his behavior.

Mr. Reuter originally called the game, \\"Sequence Five\\". Reuter spent years developing the concept, and, in June 1981, granted Jax Ltd. an exclusive license to manufacture, distribute and sell the board game, Sequence, and its subsequent variations. The game was first sold in a retail store in 1982. Objective The object of the game is to form rows of five poker chips on the board by placing the chips on the board spaces corresponding to cards played from the player's hand. Equipment Playing Board ; Instructions; 135 poker chips (50 blue, 50 green, 35 red); two full standard card decks (52 cards each, 104 cards total). Game rules Sequence can be played with 2 to 12 players. More than 12 players cannot play. If more than three people are playing, they should divide evenly into two or three teams. With two teams, players alternate their physical positions with opponents around the playing surface. With three teams, players of a team must be positioned at every third player around the playing surface. If the player who played first wins and the second player wins in the next turn it‚Äôs a tie. The game board is placed on a flat surface (such as the floor or a table) with enough room to allow for the draw deck, a discard pile and marker chips. The jokers, if any, are removed from the deck as they are not used in the game. To decide who goes first, one player shuffles the card decks into two stacks. Each player takes a card from the deck. The player with the lowest card will deal, and the cards are shuffled again. Each player or team then chooses a set of poker chips; all members of each team must use the same color chips (red is only used if there are three teams). The number of cards dealt to each player varies by the number of people playing: * Two Players: Seven cards each * Three Players: Six cards each * Four Players: Six cards each * Six Players: Five cards each * Eight Players: Four cards each * Nine Players: Four cards each * Ten Players: Three cards each * Twelve Players: Three cards each. Each card is pictured twice on the game board, and Jacks (while necessary for game strategy) do not appear on the board. The player to the left of the dealer goes first. The player chooses a card from their hand, and places a chip on one of the corresponding spaces of the game board (Example: they choose Ace of Diamonds from their hand and place a chip on the Ace of Diamonds on the board). Jacks are wild. Two-Eyed Jacks can represent any card and may be used to place a chip on any space on the board. One-Eyed Jacks can remove an opponent's token from a space. Players may use the Two-Eyed Jacks to complete a row or block an opponent, and One-Eyed Jacks can remove an opponent's advantage. One-Eyed Jacks cannot be used to remove a marker chip that is already part of a completed sequence; once a sequence is achieved by a player or team, it stands. Once a Jack is played, it ends the turn. The played card then goes face-up into a \\"Discard\\" pile, the player then draws a replacement card from the draw deck, and play passes to the left. A player may place chips on either of the appropriate card spaces as long as it is not already covered by an opponent's marker chip. If a player possesses a card which does not have an open space on the game board, the card is considered \\"dead\\" and may be exchanged for a new card. When it is their turn, they place the dead on card on the discard pile, announce they are turning in a dead card, and take a replacement (one card per turn). Then they proceed to play their normal turn. Strategy Each corner of the board has a \\"Free\\" space that all players can use to their advantage. This space acts as if it has a chip of each color on it at all times. To form rows, chips may be placed vertically, horizontally or diagonally. Each complete row of five (or four and a free corner space) is counted as a sequence. Sequences of the same color may intersect, but only at a single position. If the draw deck becomes depleted during play, the discard pile is shuffled and drawing begins again. Sequence rules dictate no table talk or coaching between team members and a precise order in which hands must be played (card, chip, replace card). If a player forgets to replace a card on their turn and if any of the other players points it out then, they cannot make it up in a later one and must continue playing the game with a reduced number of cards. Winning The game ends when a player or team completes 2 sequences.Board Game Geek http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2375/sequence Two Sequences in a row: When two (2) Sequences are required to win they can be in one straight row of nine (9) chips. It is nine and not ten (10), because the rules state that \\"you may use any 'one' of the spaces from your first Sequence as part of your second.\\" So, a straight line of 9 chips can be formed, in any order and is considered as two Sequences when the 9th chips in a row is placed. If a Sequence is not announced by the player on creating one then it will not be considered a sequence until the player wishes so. Variants=Unofficial variants A fun alternative to standard Sequence game play is to go past the minimal number of sequences to win. Players compete to fill the entire board with complete sequences of five chips (in each player's preferred color). Keep score of one point per sequence created. Different from standard game play, a player may remove chips from completed sequences to prevent opponents from scoring. For added difficulty, do not reshuffle the deck should you run out of cards. Game play ends when the board is filled and no additional moves are possible. To declare a winner, tally up the points. Whoever has the most points wins the game. A fun variation for turning sequence into a drinking game for adults is for each player to pick one (or two) number or face cards. Each time any of the chosen cards is discarded, by any player, the player who chose it has to drink. Last man standing (or the person who wins via the usual way) wins. Official variations Sequence comes in several versions, including: Sequence ‚Äì States and Capitals; Sequence Numbers; Sequence 25th Anniversary Edition; Jumbo Sequence; Travel Sequence; Sequence Deluxe Edition; and Sequence for Kids. The major difference between the different Sequence versions is the game board sizes, shapes and topics. There is also Sequence Dice which uses dice instead of cards. The object of Sequence Dice is to be the first person to connect a \\"sequence\\" of five chips in a row on the board, just as in the original game. However, a player only has to achieve one sequence in order to win instead of the two sometimes needed in the original. The board displays four interlocking arrangements of the numerals 1-9 and pictures of dice. The four corner spaces on the board depict dice arranged in a \\"snake eyes\\" pattern; that is, displaying one and one. The four spaces in the center of the board depict dice showing double- sixes. Players who roll \\"snake eyes\\" or double-sixes may roll again. A variant allows pairs that become trapped by placing your color on each side of a pair of a single opponent to be removed from the board. One or three or more are not an option, but two, not a part of a sequence can be stolen by an opponent. Additionally, this allows for another option to win, as if a player captures any five pairs of any opponent, they win the game. Legal issues During a series of legal disputes, Douglas Reuter claimed Jax violated its licensing agreement which would provide grounds for contract termination. In response, Jax denied any violation. Meanwhile, both sides continue to profit from game sales. Jax garners 80 percent of its revenue from Sequence; Reuter receives a royalty on sales of Sequence. Mr. Reuter has also started a new game company called, \\"Game Inventors of America,\\" which is located in Corinth, Texas. Unauthorized variations of Sequence have appeared many times over the years. Names of the unauthorized versions include, \\"One-Eyed Jack,\\" \\"Jack Foolery,\\" and \\"Jack Off.\\" In \\"One-Eyed Jack,\\" the board is constructed using actual playing cards. In March 2015, Jax Ltd. filed a legal claim against independent video game developer Iridium Studios over the name of their rhythm video game titled Sequence. Not wanting to pay legal fees challenging the claim, the video game developer promptly renamed their game to Before the Echo.

They were originally marketed by the Kraves Candy Co., located in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. In 2006, the brand and recipes were sold to Brookside Foods, who were in turn sold to Hershey's in 2011. Clodhoppers are available in vanilla & cocoa (originally named \\"chocolate\\") flavours, while dark chocolate, dark chocolate fudge, and \\"Cookies & Clods\\" flavours were sold during Kraves Candy's ownership of the product. The peanut butter flavour was the first flavour to be discontinued . History It has been recorded that the candy and recipe were originally created by Chris Emery's grandmother, Edith Baker, as a treat for her family. Baker made the small candies from graham wafer and chocolate. In 1996, Chris Emery and his high school friend Larry Finnson decided to sell the Clodhoppers made by Emery's grandmother in their garage. In 1998, they signed a distribution contract with Wal-Mart. The Krave's factory in Winnipeg once produced 2,500 pounds of Clodhoppers per hour. By 2006, the company's Clodhopper production plant in Winnipeg employed more than 20 employees and sold millions of the candies throughout North America. In 2006, Krave's Candy sold its assets, which included its brands, names, recipes, customer lists, inventory and packaging equipment to Brookside Foods, based in Abbotsford, British Columbia. Krave's Candy was selling millions of dollars' worth of Clodhoppers annually across North America at the time of the sale. In February 2012, Chris Emery and Larry Finnson, the founders of Clodhoppers formed a new start up, OMG's Candy, bringing to market a similar product, which includes diced almonds and toffee bits. In October 2012, Brookside Foods confirmed on their Facebook page that they had discontinued making Clodhoppers candy.https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=439537209421615&id;=144069528968386&comment;_id=4811389&offset;=0&total;_comments=1 In 2016, The Hershey Company (who bought Brookside in 2011 after the Krave's Candy sale) brought back Clodhoppers under their own branding. The revived product is available in vanilla and cocoa flavours, and can be found at some gas station and convenience store chains, including Speedway in the northeastern United States. Hershey's later released new Clodhoppers flavours in 2017 under the Hershey's Crunchers branding, including variants based on Hershey's Cookies 'n' Creme bars, Reese's peanut butter cups, and s'mores.

The character is a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes in the 30th century. She first appeared in Legion of Super-Heroes (vol 4) #66, in March 1995. Fictional character biography Zoe's mother Azra was a renowned archeologist who shuttled her and her younger brother Thanot around the galaxy on her digs. One day, Azra inhaled poisonous gas while on a dig, which started eating away at her lungs. Feeling helpless as she watched her mother die, Zoe searched through Azra's books and found a magical incantation using the Moon of Kol, an artifact her mother had found. Apparently, the Moon could transform a \\"drop of love into a wellspring of health\\" once in a lifetime. Zoe managed to heal her mother, and thus began her lust for power - but only to be used to help others and achieve self- perfection.Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 4) Annual #6 (1995) However, while her reasons were noble, Zoe's power lust became obsessive. Zoe spent the next few years searching for more sources of magic which she could use. She found one while exploring caverns on Saturn's moon Titan, where she found and absorbed an energy pool which unlocked her telekinetic abilities. Zoe named herself \\"Kinetix\\", (as in \\"telekinetics\\"), and joined the Legion of Super-Heroes as part of the second set of draftees alongside Shrinking Violet, who later became her best friend.Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 4) #66 (March 1995) Zoe would become a major asset to the Legion, being part of the team chosen to pursue Tangleweb and helping delay the Composite Man, allowing the team to regroup.Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 4) #69 (June 1995) She also developed a crush on deputy leader Leviathan, who developed an even bigger one on her. Zoe then continued to search for more power and located the Star of Akkos, thinking it would increase her powers, along with Shrinking Violet. The Star instead robbed Zoe of her powers. Zoe went on a leave of absence to look for a way to restore her powers. She was traveling through a stargate when rogue Daxamites destroyed her destination stargate, leaving her stranded. Her life support was running out when she was saved by the sorceress Mysa and brought to Zarrox, the Sorcerer's World.Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 4) #76 (January 1996) Mysa trained Zoe in the mystic arts and restored her telekinesis, altering her appearance in the process; Zoe's skin became paler, with a tattoo on her cheek, pointed elf-like ears, and a tail.Legionnaires #34 (February 1996) Mysa sent Zoe back to the Legion to find the Emerald Eye. Unbeknownst to Zoe, her best friend Violet had already been possessed by the Eye. When their mutual crush Leviathan sacrificed himself to save the team from Doctor Regulus, Violet went berserk and revealed her possession by the Emerald Eye and then possessed the Legion in order to find a way to revive Leviathan.Legionnaires #40 (September 1996) Zoe was in the Eye's thrall and tried to take the Eye for herself, but was rejected by it and nearly killed.Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 4) #84 (September 1996) Zoe, reeling from Leviathan's loss and Violet's possession, was transported by Mysa back to Zarrox along with her family and some of her teammates. Mysa was about to drain Zoe of her powers again to punish her for not being able to find the Eye first, but Azra then revealed that she had met Mysa before while she was near death, and had used a mystic artifact to heal her. Azra was pregnant with Zoe at the time and the artifact's energies forged a link between Zoe and Mysa, which allowed Mysa to manipulate Zoe later in life, and also changed Zoe's genetic structure, giving her an affinity for magic which enabled her to absorb the energy pool on Titan. Azra shamed Mysa into admitting her debt, and used the Star of Akkos to restore Zoe's powers and original appearance.Legionnaires #42 (November 1996) Kinetix went on to be instrumental in the defeat of Mordru and freeing Violet from the Eye.Legionnaires #50 (July 1997) On a mission to explore a mysterious space-time anomaly, Zoe was so enthralled by its power that she became almost catatonic. Her normally bubbly, energetic personality became submerged, leaving her silent and almost childlike.Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 4) #104 (May 1998) Concerned, Violet and Spark convinced teammate Brainiac 5 to use the Anywhere Machine to convince Zoe to shut out the awe she felt at the power and return to normal.Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 4) #113 (March 1999) Zoe was one of the Legionnaires who were Blighted, or brainwashed and renengineered into hunters and killers.\\"Legion of Super-Heroes - Legion of the Damned\\" (Vol. 1) #122 (December 1999) Several of her teammates were lost and the Legion disbanded shortly thereafter trying to seal a spatial rift. After the Legion disbanded, Kinetix joined the Science Police and was stationed on Earth.\\"The Legion\\" (vol. 1) # 4 (March 2002) When the \\"Terrorforms\\" changed the people of Earth, Zoe was among the genetic few who became a Terrorform.\\"The Legion\\" (vol. 1) #6 (May 2002) As a Terrorform, Zoe was linked to the planetary biosphere and responsible, with her fellow Terrorforms, for safeguarding and speeding up the evolutionary process on Earth. Zoe was a unique Terrorform in that she still possessed a shred of her old personality and memories, thanks to her background in magic. Zoe rejoined the Legion after it was reformed and played a key role in stopping Ra's al Ghul.\\"The Legion\\" (vol. 1) # 8 (July 2002) She was part of the team until the Fatal 500 crisis, and was stuck in Limbo along with the rest of the Legion. Kinetix has not been shown to be a member of the current version of the Legion, which has its own internal chronology and history separate from previous versions. The post-Zero Hour Legion later emerged from Limbo and joined the fight against the reformed Legion of Super- Villains. Kinetix took on Superboy-Prime and dropped her guard, unaware of his resistance to magic. Superboy-Prime killed Kinetix with his heat vision and Mordru absorbed her magics and memories.Final Crisis: Legion of Three Worlds #4 (June 2009) Powers and abilities Kinetix possessed telekinetic abilities, which she primarily used to manipulate and reshape solid matter with her thoughts. As a Terrorform, her abilities were undefined, partially as they are reactive to the circumstances she is in. She has been shown to possess healing abilities, flight, greatly enhanced strength, the ability to survive unaided in space, and control of gravity. It was revealed in the Legion of the Three Worlds mini-series that Kinetix had absorbed the magics of the home universe of Earth-247 after its destruction, making her stronger than ever.

It is outfitted with long oars, outriggers to hold the oarlocks away from the boat, and sliding seats. The boat's long length and semicircular cross-section reduce drag to a minimum. This makes the boat both fast and unstable. It must be balanced by the rowers to avoid tipping. Being able to balance ‚Äì or \\"set\\" ‚Äì the boat while putting maximum effort into the oars is therefore an essential skill of sport rowing. History The racing shell evolved from the simple working rowboat. Boats with longer hulls and narrower in beam were developed in the early 19th century specifically for team racing. These dedicated boats were the first boats that could be called racing shells, and they evolved into the highly specialized forms used today. Riggers A narrower boat provides a sharper angle to the bow and a smaller cross-sectional area reducing drag and wave drag, and avoiding hull speed limitations at race speed. The first racing shells, while narrower than working rowboats, were limited by the width necessary to mount the oarlocks on the boat's sides (\\"gunwales\\"). By attaching outriggers to the gunwales, the oarlocks could be placed farther out. This resulted in two things: oars got much longer, providing more length to the strokes, and hulls got narrower until they were as narrow as possible while still retaining sufficient buoyancy and balance. Materials University of Vermont 8+ oar shell Originally made from lapstrake wood, shells are now almost always made from a composite material for strength and weight advantages. The first composite shells were made from a form of papier-m√¢ch√© and became popular in the 1870s. These paper shells were sold world-wide by the Waters Paper Boat Factory of Troy, New York. The next evolution of rowing shells were mainly created from thin plywood sandwiching a cardboard honeycomb structure with a fiberglass outer hull. Modern shells are usually made of carbon-fibre reinforced plastic in a honeycomb structure. They are manufactured by either cold laying up of the carbon, which is then left to set, or by using heat curing, which ensures that the carbon fibre composite is properly set. The best shells are characterized by their \\"stiffness\\", as the lack of flexing means none of the force exerted by the rower is wasted in twisting the boat. Sliding seats A rower on a fixed seat is limited in the amount of power he can apply to the oars by the strength in his upper body and the distance he can pull the oars on each stroke. After riggers were added to the shell allowing the use of longer oars, rowers took advantage by taking longer strokes and using their legs during the stroke. At first, the athletes wore trousers with wear resistant leather bottoms covered in grease and the shells had concave, longitudinal seats. The athletes could then use their legs to slide along the seat, adding the power of their legs and letting them greatly lengthen the stroke. This eventually led to the modern sliding seat, mounted on rollers, commonly called the slide in the rowing community, which allows nearly frictionless movement of the rower's body. Rolling seats were introduced around the year 1880. They differed from modern seats in that ball bearings were not available. Several inventors produced designs which avoided the friction which would result from use of a simple axle and bushing design. Patents were granted to Octavius Hicks (1880), George Warin (1882), and Michael F. Davis (1882). Hicks, of Etobicoke, was a boat builder, hotelier, road and bridge contractor. Warin, of Toronto, a boat builder and famous decoy maker, was coach to world rowing champion Ned Hanlan. With the advent of the sliding seat, Hanlan was able to greatly outperform his English and American counterparts. The Davis seat used rollers in a race similar to a ball bearing. Sliding rigger The same advantages may be obtained by fixing the seat and mounting the outriggers on rollers. Now the athletes body mass remains stationary and the boat doesn't pitch bow to stern nearly as much. This improves the boat speed significantly. The disadvantage is that this arrangement may result in blisters on one's buttocks and in the risk of sliding off one's seat when exerting too much explosive force at the beginning of a race . In April 1877 Michael Davis of Portland Maine applied for a patent for a sliding rigger/foot-board with fixed seat. In 1981, the German Peter-Michael Kolbe won the FISA World Championship using a sliding rigger. In August 1983 FISA banned the use of the sliding- rigger, presumably because it was thought to be more costly than sliding-seat boats.  Boat classification  There are a large number of different types of boats. They are classified using: * Number of rowers. In all forms of modern competition the number of rowers can be 1, 2, 4, or 8. In the 19th century, there were often races with 6, 10 and 12 rowers per boat. *Position of coxswain. Boats are either coxless, bow-coxed (also called bowloaders), or stern-coxed. In coxless (\\"straight\\") boats, a steersman is responsible for steering by either use of a mechanism connecting one of his shoes by wire to the rudder‚Äîthe swiveling of the shoe turns the rudder, or by using a hand controlled string, called a tiller rope, which is parallel to the gunwales or the boat, and controls the rudder in a similar fashion. Singles and doubles do not employ a rudder in competition; the oarsmen steer by increasing or decreasing pressure or length on one scull or the other. In competition, bow- and stern-coxed boats may race one another. Although sculling and sweep boats are generally identical to each other (except having different riggers), they are referred to using different names: *Sweep: straight pair (2-), coxed pair (2+), straight four (4-), coxed four (4+), eight (8+) (always coxed) *Sculling: single (1x), double (2x), straight quad (4x), coxed quad (4x+), octuple (8x) (very rare in world class, and always coxed)  See also  * Rowing (sport) * Single scull * Sculling  Notes References *A history of paper boats, including the paper racing shell *For information on the development and process of paper boat production *History of MIT Crew: Chapter 8, which covers the evolution of the rowing shell Category:Rowing racing boats Category:Boat types Category:Rowing equipment manufacturers ","title":"Racing shell"},{"id":"1505679","text":"All Saints' Church, is in Childwall, Liverpool, England. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is the only medieval church remaining in the Metropolitan borough of Liverpool. It is an active Anglican parish church in the diocese of Liverpool, the archdeaconry of Liverpool and the deanery of Liverpool South ‚Äì Childwall. History The chancel dates from the 14th century, and the south aisle and porch are probably from the 15th century. Additions were made in the 18th century and the tower and spire date from 1810‚Äì11. The north aisle dates from 1833 and it was partly rebuilt between 1900 and 1905. There are two chapels; the Plumbs' Chapel on the north side is dated 1716 and on the south side the Salisbury pew (formerly Isaac Green's Chapel) dates from 1739‚Äì40. A restoration of the church was carried out by W. Raffles Brown in 1851‚Äì53. The rebuilding of the north aisle was by James F. Doyle and he added a vestry in 1905‚Äì06. Between 1987 and 1991 the external fabric of the church was restored and in 1994 the clock was also restored. Structure The church is built in red sandstone. Its plan consists of a west tower, a nave with a clerestory, a chancel, a south aisle and a much wider north aisle which extends to the north of the chancel, and a south porch. A chapel projects from the north aisle and another from the south aisle. The tower has a large two-light window, a clock on three faces and two-light bell-openings. The spire is recessed behind an openwork parapet with gargoyles. Internally there are three arcades with octagonal columns and double-chamfered arches. The chancel is at a lower level than the nave. A gallery extends across the west end of the nave and the south aisle. The chancel roof is wagon-vaulted. Attached to the west wall of the porch is a fragment of a Saxon cross-shaft and in the east wall of the chancel is a Norman capital, which is set horizontally. Fittings and furniture Tower and hearse house Inside the church are box pews which were installed in the restoration of 1851‚Äì53. The choir stalls date from the early 20th century; they were designed by Bodley and Scott and had been intended for the Lady Chapel of Liverpool Cathedral. In a display case is an elaborately carved bench end dating probably from the early 17th century. The brass chandelier in the nave is dated 1737 and there are two copies of it dated 1892 in the chancel. The church contains a total of 12 hatchments and a number of benefactor and charity boards.

In the south aisle are two funerary recesses which contain memorials to the Norris family of Speke Hall. In the south wall of the chancel are the remains of a 14th-century piscina. The north chancel aisle contains an enamelled brass by Warrington to the memory of Major W. Pitcairn Campbell who died in 1855. There is a ring of six bells which were cast in 1912 by John Warner & Sons. External features The churchyard contains the graves of John Charles Ryle, the first Anglican Bishop of Liverpool, and his wife, and the grave of the poet William Watson, as well as Commonwealth War Graves Commission graves of six service personnel of World War I, and five of World War II. Against the south wall of the churchyard is an elaborate pedimented arch which is a memorial to Sir Andrew Barclay Walker and his wife. Also in the churchyard is a sandstone hearse house dated 1811 which is a Grade II listed building. In media In 2015, the church was used as the filming location for a storyline in the Hollyoaks soap opera. Actress Nikki Sanderson performed a stunt, involving her regular character of Maxine Minniver, at the top of the church tower on 10 April 2015.

The band, which formed in Denver, Colorado, scored two Top 10 hits, with the singles \\"Green-Eyed Lady\\" and \\"Don't Call Us, We'll Call You\\". Moonrakers and Chocolate Hair Lead vocalist and keyboardist Jerry Corbetta, along with guitarist Bob Webber, played together in the Denver-based band The Moonrakers.

The Moonrakers had evolved from the early 1960s band The Classics (previously The Surfin' Classics, until dropping their surf music focus)‚Äîvarious members of all three incarnations would later appear on Sugarloaf songs. In late 1968, Corbetta and Webber formed the band Chocolate Hair, including drummer Myron Pollock, who'd played previously with Corbetta, plus Webber's friend, bassist Bob Raymond. Corbetta had originally started out as a drummer at the age of 4 before switching over to keyboards by age 7. During his stint in The Moonrakers, he had gone back to playing drums but one of his main reasons for leaving to form the new band was his desire to return to playing keyboards.allmusic entry on Sugarloaf. Retrieved 6 May 2011. Name change and the Liberty years Corbetta and Webber were signed to Frank Slay at this time and began recording demos during 1969. Slay got Chocolate Hair signed to Liberty Records after Liberty liked the demos the band presented to them. Slay then ended up having them put the demos on the album since they sounded so good. In September 1969 Myron Pollock decided to leave the group and the former drummer for The Moonrakers and The Surfin' Classics, Bob MacVittie, was recruited. Moonrakers singer Veeder Van Dorn was also brought in to sing on the record, making his most notable appearances on the tracks \\"Things Gonna Change Some\\" and \\"West of Tomorrow\\", though he didn't end up becoming a permanent member. \\"Green-Eyed Lady\\", recorded at Original Sound Studios in Hollywood, California, which featured MacVittie on drums, was a last minute addition to the album, which was released in the very late spring of 1970. Just before the album's release, however, the legal department at Liberty suggested the name Chocolate Hair might be taken as having racist overtones. The band members agreed to change their name to Sugarloaf, the name of a mountain outside of Boulder, Colorado,map where Bob Webber resided in an A-frame house. \\"Green-Eyed Lady\\" was written by Corbetta along with his friend Ray Payne's Sweet Pain collaborators J.C. Phillips and David Riordan. The single went on to peak at No. 3 on the Billboard chart in October 1970, while their eponymous debut album got to No. 24\\\\. Just after the first album's release, the group added singer/guitarist/composer Bob Yeazel. Yeazel had previously played in, and recorded two albums with, Denver psych band Beast, as well as Superband with Jimmy Greenspoon, who would go on to join Three Dog Night. Yeazel would feature heavily on Sugarloaf's second album, Spaceship Earth (January 1971), which would only manage to make No. 111, while the two singles taken from it, \\"Tongue-In-Cheek\\" and \\"Mother Nature's Wine\\", would peak at No. 55 and No. 88 respectively. The former was the final single ever issued by Liberty itself before it was folded into United Artists.http://globaldogproductions.info/l/liberty-56000-series.html During 1970 and 1971, Sugarloaf had a heavy touring schedule that included appearances with The Who, Deep Purple, Eric Burdon & War and other popular acts of the time. On March 16, 1971 they performed at an after party for the 13th Annual Grammy Awards with Aretha Franklin, Three Dog Night and others. The band became a sextet when they welcomed former Maul & The Kutups bassist Bobby Pickett (not the \\"Monster Mash\\" performer) on May 16, 1971 and six days later, they appeared on American Bandstand to play \\"Green Eyed Lady\\" and \\"Mother Nature's Wine\\". In 1972 Sugarloaf played on the single \\"I.O.I.O.\\", a cover of a Bee Gees song recorded by TV actor Butch Patrick that was produced by Frank Slay. Bob Yeazel and Bobby Pickett left Sugarloaf sometime in mid-1972. Pickett later went on to perform with Etta James, Gregg Allman, the rock group Detective and Cafe R&B.; Yeazel stayed in music for a while playing in various bands, then took an eight-year break from performing before he once again began touring, writing songs and recording demos. And after a falling out with Corbetta, Bob Webber, Bob Raymond and Bob MacVittie departed the group as well by late 1972, leaving Corbetta with the rights to the Sugarloaf name. Resumption and another hit Eventually Liberty decided to drop all their artists and Sugarloaf was in limbo in 1973 as Jerry Corbetta signed to Neil Bogart's Brut Records label, which Bogart had created and distributed, via his Buddah Records imprint, for the Brut Faberg√© company. The next album, I Got a Song, released in late 1973, was started as a Corbetta solo record but ended up becoming Sugarloaf's third album when Webber and Raymond rejoined Corbetta, with drummer Larry Ferris, to play on the album and once again began making live appearances. This iteration of Sugarloaf played a spot on The Midnight Special that aired on April 19, 1974. But after Brut folded, the group's future was once again in question as Corbetta and Frank Slay bought the album back from Bogart and went to a friend's recording studio in Denver in 1974 to record a new song, \\"Don't Call Us, We'll Call You\\", with session players Paul Humphries (drums), Max Bennett (bass), Ray Payne (guitar) and a group called the Flying Saucers (Jason Hickman, Mikkel Saks and David Queen) on harmony vocals. This song was notable because it contained a practical joke at the expense of CBS Records, which had just turned them down for a recording contract. The song includes the sound of a touch-tone telephone number being dialed near the beginning and ending of the song. Those numbers were an unlisted phone number at CBS Records in Manhattan (\\"area code 212\\" stated in the song) ‚Äì coincidentally a public number at the White House as well (different area code). In addition, the recording includes snippets of the guitar riff of The Beatles' \\"I Feel Fine\\", Stevie Wonder's \\"Superstition\\" and a line of dialogue from disc jockey Ken Griffin imitating Wolfman Jack (who would later perform the song live with the group on their Midnight Special appearance) stating the call sign of a radio station (\\"Stereo 92\\" in the nationwide release); numerous tracks of this line were cut to match local markets. \\"Don't Call Us...\\", written by Corbetta along with John Carter, was released in November 1974 on Slay's Claridge Records label and after it took off and peaked at No. 9 in April 1975, the I Got a Song album was quickly re- released under the new title of Don't Call Us, We'll Call You with the hit single added in place of another track, \\"Easy Evil\\". But the album stalled out at US No. 152 on the Billboard Top 200. Also in 1974, Corbetta played with the group Disco-Tex and the Sex-O-Lettes on their hit \\"Get Dancin'\\", that was produced by Bob Crewe, Corbetta's new partner, and contributed to other projects, including the band Chinook. Another single not on the LP, \\"Stars in My Eyes\\", peaked at No. 87 in June 1975 and Sugarloaf realigned with Corbetta, Webber, Raymond and original Chocolate Hair/first album drummer Myron Pollock and toured once again in 1975 behind the success of \\"Don't Call Us...\\". A live recording of the band was made at Ebbets Field (a small club, not the former Brooklyn ball park) in Denver in July 1975 that was eventually released in 2006 as the CD Alive in America. \\"I Got a Song\\", the title track of their 1973 album, was released as a single in October 1975 but only \\"bubbled under\\" on Billboard at No. 110\\\\. A Corbetta solo single, \\"You Set My Dreams to Music\\", recorded around this time, ended up in a 1977 film The Legend of Frank Woods and Sugarloaf's final single, \\"Satisfaction Guaranteed\\", was released in 1976 but failed to chart. All singles from \\"Don't Call Us...\\" on appeared on the Claridge label. Break-up and later years By the end of '75, Webber and Raymond were gone from the group and Corbetta continued to tour as Jerry Corbetta and Sugarloaf with drummer Myron Pollock, adding Ray Payne on guitar and Rusty Buchanan (later with Player) on bass until 1978 when he decided to retire the Sugarloaf name and pursue a solo career. His first and only solo album, Jerry Corbetta, was put out on Warner Bros. that same year.https://www.discogs.com/Jerry-Corbetta-Jerry-Corbetta/master/674421 He was also a member of Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons from 1980 to 1984. On June 12, 1985 there was a one/off Sugarloaf reunion at the Colorado Cream Festival that included Corbetta, Myron Pollock, Bob Yeazel and new players Larry Wilkins (guitar) and Bryan Grassmeyer (bass). During 1989 to 1991, Corbetta and Wilkins attempted to get Sugarloaf up and running again with the help of Bob Crewe but without success. In 1991 Corbetta was part of a touring rock & roll nostalgia show, 30 Years of Rock and Roll. This led to him teaming with two other rock vets on that bill, guitarist/singer Mike Pinera (ex-Blues Image and Iron Butterfly) and bassist Dennis Noda (ex-Cannibal & the Headhunters), later that year to form another all stars touring act, The Sugarloaf/Iron Butterfly/Cannibal & the Headhunters Revue, which changed its moniker to The Classic Rock All-Stars in 1992 and added former Rare Earth singer/drummer Peter Rivera and various others, like Micky Dolenz and Spencer Davis, who drifted in and out over the years. https://forums.stevehoffman.tv/threads/jerry-corbetta-sugarloaf- rip.594466/page-2 According to Corbetta, a few times during the 1990s and in 2005, The Classic Rock All-Stars did a few shows as Sugarloaf with a different drummer in place of Rivera. On January 19, 2008 The Brewery Arts Center in Carson City, Nevada presented the Brewery‚Äôs Legends of Rock show, which featured Corbetta and Noda, plus Omar Martinez (ex-Paul Revere and the Raiders) and local guitarist Michael Furlong. Corbetta was forced to retire from performing in 2010 after contracting Pick's disease, a progressive neurological problem similar to Alzheimer's disease.

Utah's Dixie is the nickname for the moderately populated, lower-elevation area of south-central Washington County in southwestern Utah. Its climate is very mild when compared to the rest of Utah, and typical of the Mojave Desert, in which it lies. Situated south of the Black Ridge and west of the Hurricane Cliffs, in the northeastern edge of the Mojave Desert, it was originally settled by the Southern Paiutes. When recently won from Mexico, it was inhabited by members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or Mormons in 1854, as part of Brigham Young's efforts to establish an Indian Mission in the region. During the later 1850s, the settlers began growing cotton and other temperate cash crops in the area of Santa Clara, Utah. The Paiute population that had been displaced by the new settlers began to decline due to diseases that the settlers brought and exposed them to. Utah History To Go, American Indians, Paiutes from historytogo.utah.gov accessed December 4, 2015.  The Cotton Mission  The area was first referred to as the ‚ÄúCotton Mission,‚Äù in response to Brigham Young‚Äôs 14th General Epistle issued in October 1856. In spite of his determination that the Great Basin would be self-sufficient, it was not. He criticized the Saints as ‚Äúquite negligent in raising cotton and flax.‚Äù His command was emphatic: ‚ÄúAnd let our brethren who have the means, bring on cotton and woolen machinery, that we may be enabled to manufacture our own goods, so fast as we shall be able to supply ourselves with the raw material . . . .‚Äù  The Origin of the Name \\"Dixie\\"  ‚Äú[The] first groups of settlers [arriving in Spring 1857] - the Adair and Covington Companies - were people from the Southern States, mainly from Mississippi, Alabama, Virginia, Texas, and Tennessee.‚Äù While there is no indication of slavery in Utah‚Äôs cotton farming, Robert Dockery Covington, the leader of the second company of saints, was formerly a slave overseer and owner of eight slaves in the 1840 Census, which made ‚Äúfarming a very profitable occupation.‚Äù A contemporary said: ‚ÄúHe was a strong Rebel sympathizer and rejoiced whenever he heard of a Southern victory.‚Äù Covington was the first President of the Washington Branch of the LDS Church. Covington's first counselor was Alexander Washington Collins, who the contemporary says was a former slave driver, who boastfully, with humor, and in public, told horrific stories of whippings and rapes of his slaves. Andrew Larson's landmark history of the area states that in 1857, the area was already taking on the \\"Dixie\\" nickname:  Meeting Challenges Together  The hardships of this time are inconceivable in light of today's environment of golf courses, fitness spas, retirement, health care, outdoor recreation, vacation homes, an interstate highway, a regional airport, and air conditioning. \\"[T]he harsh environment, the intense heat of summer, the continual toil, and the ravages of malaria . . . led some of the settlers to desert the place at the end of the first season.\\"I Was Called to Dixie, p. 71. In the fall of 1858, it was reported \\"that of approximately 400 acres planted to cotton only 130 acres could be counted a success.\\"I Was Called to Dixie, p. 70. Cultivation of cotton and food crops depended on irrigation, which was a collective activity. There were regular food shortages, including \\"the 'starving time' when many people were reduced to eating pigweed, alfalfa, and carrot top greens in lieu of a more substantial diet.\\"I Was Called to Dixie, p. 75. But the sense of humor was not absent. George A. Hicks wrote a twelve stanza song which was a lament as well as wry comedy: > I feel so weak and hungry now, I think I'm nearly dead. \\"Tis seven weeks > next Sunday since I have tasted bread. Of carrot tops and lucern greens we > have enough to eat -- But I'd like to change that diet off for buckwheat > cakes and meat.The Red Hills of November, p. 70. Charles L. Walker, a Latter-day Saint hymnist, wrote a song titled \\"St. George and the Drag-on\\" with a chorus first line meant to inspire singing along: \\"Mesquite, soap root, prickly-pears and briars.\\" This verse is the last: > The sun is it so scorching hot, It makes the water siz, Sir. The reason why > it is so hot, Is just because it is, Sir. The wind like fury here does blow, > That when we plant or sow, Sir, We place one foot upon the seed, And hold it > till it grows, Sir. The culture in the time, on a foundation of a shared religion, shared suffering and success, and even a collective economy for a time.I Was Called to Dixie, pp. 290-313. A Mormon Pioneer in a neighboring area gave this expression: This was a challenging task, in significant isolation, in the deserts of Southern Utah. This collective bond is a foundation of what is often called the \\"Spirit of Dixie.\\"  The End of the Cotton Mission  The Cotton Mission did not work out as well as Young had hoped. Yields in the test fields were not as high as expected, and economic viability of growing cotton was never achieved, although a cotton mill was built and used for a few years in the town of Washington. ‚Äú[C]onsistent operation of the Factory‚Äù ended in 1897.I Was Called to \\"Dixie' p. 232.  Widespread Use of \\"Dixie\\"  Sugarloaf in St. George Utah with 1914 D The name \\"Dixie\\" was used by residents and others in the state as a shorthand reference to the area. The former St. George Stake Academy officially became Dixie College in 1915.I Was Called to \\"Dixie' p. 563. About that time, ‚ÄúDixie‚Äù was painted on a red rock on the hill above St. George commonly called the Sugarloaf. Previously, the hill had been painted with the year of the graduating class and a ‚ÄúD‚Äù. The \\"Dixie Rock\\" on the hill served to mark the name. In this time period, the nation was in a wave of nostalgic revisionism (including Lost Cause mythology) that made Dixie and the South an idealization of moonlight and magnolias \\"by the many attentions of northern artists to southern mythology, the North's fascination with aristocracy and lost causes, the national appeal of the agrarian myth, and the South's personification of that ideal, to say nothing of the North's persistent use of the South in the manipulation of her own racial mythology.\\" Now dozens of institutions and businesses use the name ‚ÄúDixie.‚Äù  Devotion to the \\"Dixie\\" Name  Strong ties to the ‚ÄúDixie‚Äù name are felt by descendants of the pioneers, by other long time residents, and by the thousands who are new to the area. ‚ÄúIronically, the many newcomers . . . who recently have come . . . generally are more than pleased to identify with the term ‚ÄòDixie‚Äô.‚ÄùA History of Washington County, p. 11. Those with long-standing ties to the area, and those who are newer, speak with deep affection of the land as giving you ‚Äúred sand in your shoes‚Äù ‚Äì something they feel is unique to that part of Utah. And they know those songs that resonate deep emotion, such as those by Hicks and Walker, mentioned above. A more well known song (adapted from a popular Southern song published in 1915 \\"Are You From Dixie?\\" ) sung by college students, school children, and former Mayor Daniel D. McArthur, is ‚ÄúAre You From Dixie?‚Äù > Are you from Dixie? I said from Dixie! Where the fields of cotton beckon to > me. We‚Äôre glad to see ya To say ‚ÄòHow be ya?‚Äô And the friends we‚Äôre longin‚Äô > to see. If you‚Äôre from Santa Clara, Washington Or St. George, fine, Anywhere > below the Iron County line, Then you‚Äôre from Dixie, Hurray for Dixie, ‚ÄôCause > I‚Äôm from Dixie, too!‚Äù = Residents and Descendants = Many of the advocates are fifth generation residents of the area, or descendants of those who lived here years ago, who now live in other areas. They speak with a patriotic fervor. Understanding their devotion comes from to understanding their history. They have for years heard stories ‚Äì and experienced ‚Äì the privations of living in Southwestern Utah. To them, ‚ÄúDixie‚Äù in the historical sense means cotton ‚Äì a failing enterprise that exhausted their ancestors. Cotton was an expression of faith and solidarity; a commitment to a common cause. But after cotton, ‚ÄúDixie‚Äù means home. From the end of Cotton before 1900 to 1950 meant the unique low- lying desert surrounded by high red cliffs and black lava bluffs, bisected by the Virgin River that gave life to people, livestock, fields, and pastures. Utah‚Äôs Dixie was so distant from the Wasatch Front, where most of Utah‚Äôs population lives, and from the state capital in Salt Lake City that it was a separate existence. Utah‚Äôs Dixie had no geographic ties with most of Arizona, only that near-wilderness of the Arizona Strip, north of the Grand Canyon. And while the Virgin Valley area of Nevada had close relations, the historically religious residents of Southwestern Utah did not feel connected to Las Vegas. The area was not connected to much. Roads were rough and rugged until the 1950s and Interstate 15 was only completed in 1973. Air service from St. George began in the late 1950s. Television service came about the same time. The community was small. St. George only had 5,130 inhabitants in 1960 and 11,350 in 1980.St. George, Utah#Demographics. It did not wield much political influence, but it was advanced by exemplary state legislators from the area, such as Orval Hafen. To these long-term residents or descendants, \\"Dixie\\" is flavored with the College, High School, and lifestyle of a unique area, unlike its state or surrounding states. The St. George UtahSugarloaf newly painted with the word \\"Dixie\\" 20th century links to the Confederacy at Dixie State College  It does not appear that links of Southern Utah's Dixie to the Confederacy re-emerged until 1952, when \\"Dixie Junior College sports teams adopted 'Rebel' as their nickname and the school made its mascot a Confederate soldier in 1956. By 1960, the Confederate flag was flown as a school symbol.\\" This was about the time the University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV) adopted its \\"Rebel\\" name and mascot, \\"a cartoon wolf with a Confederate uniform.\\" This was also in a time when civil rights issues were emerging, between President Truman's integration of the Armed Services in 1948 and Brown v. Board of Education in 1954. On a ‚Äúparade float called 'Gone With the Plow,' dating from the late 1960s, a man with his skin painted black pushe[d] a plow while a white student, formally dressed with a top hat, [held] what appear to be reins or a whip.‚Äù John Jones and Dannelle Larsen-Rife wrote on behalf of the Southern Utah Anti-Discrimination Coalition, listing many Confederacy-related activities at the College: ‚Äúblack-face minstrel shows (through October 2012), mock slave auctions (through the early 1990s),;;; Confederate flags (continuing to the present), and numerous other associations to the Confederacy prevalent on this campus (The \\"Rebel\\" mascot as recently as 2008, True Rebel Night is ongoing; The Dixie Confederate Yearbook into the 1990s).‚Äù The Salt Lake Tribune recounted photos in old Dixie College yearbooks, called \\"The Confederate.\\" ‚Äú[A]s late as the early 1990s [w]hite students sing in black face, dress as Confederate soldiers, stage slave auctions and affectionately display the Confederate battle standard.‚Äù The local newspaper 'The Spectrum' reviewed and published excerpts from local newspapers and Dixie College publications that contain Confederate related activities, photographs, and references. In March 1987 and 1988 the community was swept up in a Secession, presided over in 1987 by Governor Norman Bangerter and in 1988 by Wilford Brimley. Events included a Ball in grand Southern style, presided over by costumed Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara, who also participated in many publicity photos. A 40-foot Confederate flag hung over St. George Boulevard. Confederate flags were abundantly displayed by city, county and school officials in promotional photographs, and the Washington County News masthead had the Confederate flag and cited its location as \\"St. George, Confederate State of Dixie.\\".  \\"Dixie\\" controversy  Controversy over the use of the name \\"Dixie\\" has repeatedly arisen in the Southern Utah community at large. 2019-2020 national controversy In 2019, Miami-Dade \\"county Commissioner Dennis Moss announced he intends to introduce legislation that would rename the portion of Dixie Highway that runs through Miami-Dade.\\" \\"Moss said the word 'is associated with the Confederacy, slavery, KKK, and those kinds of negative movements that have been a part of our past.'\\" He said he was working on legislation that would change all roadways in the county \\"that include the word 'Dixie,' which has a very derogatory meaning as it relates to African- Americans.\\" In early 2020, the Commission unanimously voted to change the name to Harriett Tubman Highway. The singing group \\"Dixie Chicks,\\" dropped \\"Dixie\\" from their name June 25, 2020. The band \\"pointed out that they had picked 'that stupid name' as teenagers, and had wanted to change it for years\\" and \\"said they were moved to change it when they saw the Confederate flag described as 'the Dixie Swastika' on social media in June 2020.\\" quoted in The Chicks#2016-93present: MMXVI World Tour, Gaslighter, and name change Controversy at Dixie State University The Confederate flag was removed as a Dixie College symbol in 1993. In 2005 the Confederate soldier 'Rodney the Rebel' was eliminated as the mascot, and use of the nickname 'Rebels' was discontinued in 2007. In 2007, as Dixie College was considering affiliation with the University of Utah ‚ÄúU. officials said dropping the 'baggage' of Dixie would be mandatory.\\" \\"'Dixie' has connotations of the Old South, the Confederacy, and racism,‚Äô Randy Dryer, then the U. trustees' chairman, wrote to The Chronicle of Higher Education.‚Äù The affiliation with the University of Utah did not happen. In 2012, many articles appeared as the school was about to make \\"the leap to university status next year.\\" The Salt Lake Tribune editorialized that the school needed a new name based on the pioneer origin of the name, and Confederacy-honoring practices of the students.

In 2015, following the Charleston, South Carolina, shootings by Dylann Roof, Dannelle Larsen-Rife again editorialized for renaming Dixie State University. She was interviewed on an episode of RadioWest (KUER) with professors from the University of Utah and University of Wyoming. A substantial statue of rebel soldiers and a horse, with a Confederate flag displayed, was returned to its sculptor. In 2020, in the wake of the killing of George Floyd and the emergence of a nationwide series of BlackLivesMatter protests, the issue again returned. Jamie Belnap, a former resident of St. George, wrote \\"Now, seven years after the vote at DSU [to retain the Dixie name], murmurings about the name 'Dixie' have begun again. There‚Äôs a new petition and, unsurprisingly, online detractors from the community have already begun to emerge....

After a rebranding study, the governing board voted to change the Dixie Center name to Greater Zion Convention Center, consistent with the area's Greater Zion Convention and Tourism Office, which had a name change in 2019. \\"The vote to change [the Convention Center name] to Greater Zion on June 23 led to a flood of social media posts and an online petition that gathered over 17,000 signatures in favor of keeping Dixie as the name.\\" \\"[A]fter a public comment period in which multiple community members expressed strong support of the Dixie name, the Interlocal Agency amended the motion to temporarily revert to the Dixie Center name and to meet again on the issue in six months.\\" Controversy in the community A substantial number of citizens gathered at the St. George City offices July 2, 2020 to advocate for retaining the \\"Dixie\\" names. Joey Sammons Ashby, who organized the event as part of the Protect Dixie effort,. said ‚ÄúPeople in St. George are not racist . . . .

It has a curved tube, and in the case of instruments by Eichentopf (and modern copies of same), a brass bell, unusual for an oboe. Its range is close to that of the cor anglais--that is, from the F below middle C (notated C4 but sounding F3) to the G above the treble staff (notated D6 but sounding G5). The oboe da caccia is thus a transposing instrument in F. The notated range is identical to that of the soprano baroque oboe, and with a good reed, all registers speak very easily. Johann Sebastian Bach tended to favor the middle and lowest registers, however, perhaps because they are the most characteristic ones for this instrument. Development The instrument was likely invented by J.H. Eichentopf of Leipzig, Germany.See Cary Karp, \\"Structural Details of two J.H. Eichentopf Oboi da Caccia\\" and Reine Dahlqvist, \\"Taille, Oboe da Caccia and Corno Inglese\\", Galpin Society Journal May 1973. The first dated reference to the oboe da caccia is 1722, when composer Johann Friedrich Fasch ordered \\"Waldhautbois\\" from Leipzig for the court at Zerbst.Bruce Haynes, The Speaking Hautboy, draft 21 April 1998, pp. 72-74. The first recorded use of the instrument is on 24 June 1723, when the Bach aria BWV 167/3, \\"Gottes Wort, das tr√ºget nicht\\", from the cantata Ihr Menschen, r√ºhmet Gottes Liebe, BWV 167, was performed. As Bach had arrived in Leipzig just a month before, it seems hardly possible that he had been involved in developing the new instrument, even if one were to question the identity of the Waldhautbois a year earlier. But Bach was certainly the most prolific and most important composer for oboe da caccia, often using them in pairs. In 1723 alone, Bach wrote four cantatas using this instrument, the others being Schauet doch und sehet, ob irgend ein Schmerz sei, BWV 46, 1 August, Siehe zu, da√ü deine Gottesfurcht nicht Heuchelei sei, BWV 179, 8 August), and Ich elender Mensch, wer wird mich erl√∂sen, BWV 48, 3 October.Christoph Wolff et al., \\"Bach Family\\", 1983. Bach wrote extensively for the oboe da caccia in the years 1723-27. There are also significant parts for the oboe da caccia in his Christmas Oratorio (BWV 248, 1734), the Passions (St John Passion, 1724, and St Matthew Passion, c. 1727), and the cantatas. Other known compositions for the oboe da caccia are by Fasch. , Christoph Graupner; , and Giovanni Battista Ferrandini; [Haynes, op.cit.]. The oboe da caccia was used only in the late Baroque period, after which it fell out of use until interest in authentic performance in the 20th century caused it to be revived. During the period c. 1780-1820, roughly the Classical period, centering on Vienna, the soprano oboe underwent major changes first in bore and then in keywork. It is therefore understandable that the oboe da caccia, with its complex means of construction, was not selected for the same evolutionary \\"treatment\\". The early English horn (corno inglese, cor anglais) was no doubt more suitable. Innovation was the watchword of the day, and antiquated instruments such as the oboe da caccia stood little chance of surviving (cf. the way in which the piano supplanted the harpsichord). A curious note: according to Cecil Forsyth in his famous book on orchestration, Beethoven was the last composer to write a part for the oboe da caccia until modern times. However, Forsyth wrote during a period when organology (the study of musical instruments) was in its infancy. Many of his statements, including the one about Beethoven, are in need of revision in light of modern research--in this case, Beethoven--in his Trios for two oboes and a deeper instrument in F --clearly labeled this deeper part \\"corno inglese\\" (English horn). Construction The oboe da caccia has a leather-covered wooden body terminating in a large wooden bell, or in the case of Eichentopf's instruments, a flaring brass bell as pictured above. There are typically two brass keys, E-flat and C. The E-flat key is normally doubled for the left hand. There are usually two twin fingerholes, G/A-flat and F/F#, similar to the soprano baroque oboe. The construction differs from that of practically all other woodwinds. The bore and outward profiles are first created on the lathe, then a series of saw kerfs are made through the bore from the side, which is to become the inner curve. Then the instrument is bent over steam and a slat glued onto the inside curve to fix it. Any remaining lacunae in the kerfs are filled and the curved section is covered with leather. The da caccia is played with a double reed; the sound is very mellow and supple. The oboe da caccia stands in a rather unusual relationship to the rest of the oboe family. It cannot rightly be called the precursor of the English horn (the predominant name in North America and German-speaking countries) or cor anglais (the name used in England and France), as it largely developed at the same time as the English horn. The evolution of the English horn is more complex and less straightforward. The da caccia sounds like none of the other members of the oboe family, and no other instrument may legitimately substitute for it-- although the English horn is routinely used for this purpose. The oboe da caccia after Bach and modern reconstruction After Bach, the oboe da caccia quickly fell out of use. The knowledge of its exact sound and construction was lost, and instruments once believed to be oboes da caccia have proven not to be this instrument at all or to consist only of parts of one. The consensus amongst scholars during the first half of the 20th century was that no known instruments from Bach's time had survived to the present day. Curt Sachs, in his Real-Lexicon der Musikinstrumente (1913), for example, included a crude and rather speculative drawing of an oboe da caccia. Interest in the da caccia was revived in the early 1970s, in part due to the ongoing Telefunken Records project to record the complete cantatas of J.S. Bach, conducted by Nikolaus Harnoncourt and Gustav Leonhardt. The taille, a straight two-key oboe pitched in F, had previously been used for the da caccia parts in period-instrument recordings, with mixed results. It fell to Cary Karp, a curator at the Music Museum in Stockholm, Sweden, to make the discovery that in fact two well- preserved (but unplayable) Eichentopf da caccias existed in museums in Scandinavia: one of them in his own museum, and another in a museum in Copenhagen. The results of his research were published in the Galpin Society Journal article. Using measurements taken from the two instruments, oboist and instrument maker Paul Hailperin of Zell im Wiesental, Germany made the first modern-day copies, and these were used in the Harnoncourt recording of the Weihnachtsoratorium that appeared in late 1973. Modern-day makers of oboes da caccia include Sand Daltonhttp://baroqueoboes.com/OBOES/oboe415.html of Lopez Island, Washington, United States; Richard Earle in the UK; Marcel Ponseele in France; Henri Gohin in France; and Joel Robinson in New York City.

Second, from Saint-Omer seawards, approximately , it is a navigable waterway connecting with the Canal de Calais leading to Calais and the Canal de Bourbourg leading to Dunkirk, as shown by the map of the navigable waterways. The section of the river from Saint-Omer down to the junction with the main Dunkirk-Scheldt waterway is currently disused, as is the Canal de Neuffoss√© heading upstream to the same main route at Arques. Location of the navigable part of the river Aa and connections with other waterways History Saint-Omer formerly lay at the head of its estuary while to seaward, Calais lay on its western margin and Bergues, now inland from Dunkirk, on its eastern one. By the time of the Viking settlements on this coast, Dunkirk was developing on the dunes, offshore across the estuarine marsh from Bergues. Gravelines was the later port at the seaward end of the river as it became, after the area of the estuary was reclaimed. The dates of these events are imprecise but the modern pattern was firmly established by 1588, the time of the Spanish Armada, when an approximation to the modern course of the lowland river formed the boundary between the Spanish Netherlands and France. Pollution The river suffers significant problems from industrial discharge, as well as siltation that made the length from Saint-Omer down to the junction with the Dunkirk-Escaut waterway unnavigable from the 1970s.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is the earliest of three churches in Liverpool built by John Cragg, who used many components in cast iron which were made at his Mersey Iron Foundry. It is an active Anglican parish church in the Diocese of Liverpool, the Liverpool archdeaconry, and the Liverpool North deanery. History The building of the church was enabled by an Act of Parliament, the St. George's Church, Everton Act, which was passed in 1813. The foundation stone was laid on 19 April 1813 and the church was consecrated by the Bishop of Chester on 26 October 1814. The architect was Thomas Rickman and the church was built by John Cragg. Structure The outer shell of the church is built in stone while the interior is in cast iron. Its plan consists of a west tower, a seven-bay nave with aisles, and a short chancel. Porches flank the tower and chancel. The tower has diagonal buttresses, an arched west door with a three-light window above. The next stage has a clock on three faces and above this are three-light bell-openings which are partly glazed and partly louvred. On the summit is an embattled parapet with pinnacles at the corners. All the windows have cast iron tracery. Internally the nave has arcades of cast iron and the aisles have galleries. The roof is of cast iron. The architectural style of the church is Perpendicular. Tie rods were added in the 20th century. Fittings and furniture Most of the stained glass was destroyed in the Second World War. The only complete survivor is a window dated 1863 by A. Gibbs. The glass in the east window dates from 1952 and is by Shrigley and Hunt. The memorials include one under the tower to John Rackham who died in 1815 which was designed by Thomas Rickham and carved by S. & J. Franceys, a memorial to Thomas W. Wainwright, a surgeon who died in 1841 with a relief of the Good Samaritan by William Spence, and in the north gallery is a Gothic tabernacle by Emanuel Edward Geflowski to the memory of engineer Walter Fergus MacGregor who died in 1863. The original chair frame bell was made by Ainsworth of Warrington. It was restored in 1937 by George Eccles but vandalised in the late 1960s. The present clock was made by Smiths of Clerkenwell and installed in 1973.

He was elected consul for the year 191 BC together with Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica.Broughton, MRR2, p. 525. As consul, Glabrio defeated the Seleucid ruler Antiochus the Great at the Battle of Thermopylae, and compelled him to leave Greece. He then turned his attention to the Aetolian League, who had persuaded Antiochus to declare war against Rome, and was only prevented from crushing them by the intercession of Titus Quinctius Flamininus. In 189, Glabrio was a candidate for the censorship, but was opposed by the patrician faction.Livy Ab urbe condita XXXVII 57,9-58,2 He was accused by the tribunes of having concealed a portion of the Syrian spoils in his own house; his legate gave evidence against him, and he withdrew his candidature.

It may be used together with ondansetron and dexamethasone. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include tiredness, loss of appetite, diarrhea, abdominal pain, hiccups, itchiness, pneumonia, and blood pressure changes. Other severe side effects may include anaphylaxis. While use in pregnancy does not appear to be harmful, such use has not been well studied. Aprepitant belongs to the class of neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists medications. It works by blocking substance P from attaching to the NK1 receptors. Aprepitant was approved for medical use in Europe and the United States in 2003. It is made by Merck & Co. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. A form that can be given by injection into a vein, known as fosaprepitant is also available. Medical uses Aprepitant is used to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) and to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting. Safety and usefulness of long term use or in those who already have nausea is unclear. It may be used together with ondansetron and dexamethasone. It is taken by mouth.  Mechanism of action  Aprepitant is classified as an NK1 antagonist because it blocks signals given off by NK1 receptors. This, therefore, decreases the likelihood of vomiting in patients. NK1 is a G protein-coupled receptor located in the central and peripheral nervous system. This receptor has a dominant ligand known as Substance P (SP). SP is a neuropeptide, composed of 11 amino acids, which sends impulses and messages from the brain. It is found in high concentrations in the vomiting center of the brain, and, when activated, it results in a vomiting reflex. In addition to this it also plays a key part in the transmission of pain impulses from the peripheral receptors to the central nervous system. Aprepitant has been shown to inhibit both the acute and delayed emesis induced by cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs by blocking substance P landing on receptors in the brain's neurons. Positron emission tomography (PET) studies, have demonstrated that aprepitant can cross the blood brain barrier and bind to NK1 receptors in the human brain. It has also been shown to increase the activity of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists ondansetron and the corticosteroid dexamethasone, which are also used to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy. Aprepitant is taken orally in the form of a capsule. Before clinical testing, a new class of therapeutic agent has to be characterized in terms of preclinical metabolism and excretion studies. Average bioavailability is found to be around 60-65%. Aprepitant is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 with minor metabolism by CYP1A2 and CYP2C19. Seven metabolites of aprepitant, which are only weakly active, have been identified in human plasma. As a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4, aprepitant can increase plasma concentrations of co-administered medicinal products that are metabolized through CYP3A4. Specific interaction has been demonstrated with oxycodone, where aprepitant both increased the efficacy and worsened the side effects of oxycodone; however it is unclear whether this is due to CPY3A4 inhibition or through its NK-1 antagonist action. Following IV administration of a 14C-labeled prodrug of aprepitant (L-758298), which is converted rapidly and completely to aprepitant, approximately 57% of the total radioactivity is excreted in the urine and 45% in feces. No unchanged substance is excreted in urine.FDA Advisory Committee Background Package  Structure and properties  Aprepitant is made up of a morpholine core with two substituents attached to adjacent ring carbons. These substitute groups are trifluoromethylated 1-phenylethanol and fluorophenyl group. Aprepitant also has a third substituent (triazolinone), which is joined to the morpholine ring nitrogen. It has three chiral centres very close together, which combine to produce an amino acetal arrangement. Its empirical formula is C23H21F7N4O3. Aprepitant is an off-white crystalline solid that has a molecular weight of around 534.53. It has a very limited solubility in water. It does have a reasonably high solubility in non-polar molecules such as oils. This would, therefore, suggest that aprepitant as a whole, despite having components that are polar, is a non-polar substance.  Synthesis  Shortly after Merck initiated research into reducing the severity and likelihood of CINV, researchers discovered that aprepitant is effective in prevention. Researchers worked on coming up with a process to create aprepitant, and within a short period they came up with effective synthesis of the substance. This original synthesis was deemed to be workable and proved to be a crucial step in achieving commercialization; however, Merck decided that the process was not environmentally sustainable. This was due to the original synthesis requiring six steps, many of which needed dangerous chemicals such as sodium cyanide, dimethyltitanocene, and gaseous ammonia. In addition to this, for the process to be effective cryogenic temperatures were needed for some of the steps and other steps produced hazardous byproducts such as methane. The environmental concerns of the synthesis of aprepitant became so great that Merck research team decided to withdraw the drug from clinical trials and attempt to create a different synthesis of aprepitant. The gamble of taking the drug out of clinical trials proved to be successful when shortly afterwards the team of Merck researchers came up with an alternative and more environmentally friendly synthesis of aprepitant. The new process works by four compounds of similar size and complexity being fused together. This therefore is a much simpler process and requires only three steps, half the number of the original synthesis. The new process begins by enantiopure trifluoromethylated phenyl ethanol being joined to a racemic morpholine precursor. This results in the wanted isomer crystallizing on the top of the solution and the unwanted isomer remaining in the solution. The unwanted isomer is then converted to the wanted one by the chemist controlling the reaction conditions and a process known as crystallization-induced asymmetric transformation occurring. By the end of this step a secondary amine, the base of the drug, is formed. The second step involves the fluorophenyl group being attached to the morpholine ring. Once this has been achieved the third and final step can initiated. This step involved a side chain of triazolinone being added to the ring. Once this step has been successfully completed a stable molecule of aprepitant has been produced. This more streamlined route yields around 76% more aprepitant than the original process and reduces the operating cost by a significant amount. In addition, the new process also reduces the amount of solvent and reagents required by about 80% and saving an estimated 340,000L per ton of aprepitant produced. The improvements in the synthesis process have also decreased the long-term detriment to the natural environment associated with the original procedure, due to eliminating the use of several hazardous chemicals. History It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2003. In 2008, fosaprepitant, an intravenous form of aprepitant was approved in the United States.  Research = Major depression  Plans to develop aprepitant as an antidepressant have been withdrawn. Subsequently, other trials with NK1 receptor antagonists, casopitant and orvepitant, have shown promising results. Beyond suggestions that PET receptor occupancy must not be used routinely to cap dosing for new medical indications for this class, or that > 99% human receptor occupancy might be required for consistent psycho- pharmacological or other therapeutic effects, critical scientific dissection and debate of the above data might be needed to enable aprepitant, and the class of NK1 antagonists as a whole, to fulfill preclinically predicted utilities beyond CINV (i.e., for other psychiatric disorders, addictions, neuropathic pain, migraine, osteoarthritis, overactive bladder, inflammatory bowel disease and other disorders with suspected inflammatory or immunological components. However, most data remain proprietary and thus reviews on the expanded clinical potential for drugs like aprepitant range from optimistic to poor.

Sun Boy (real name Dirk Morgna of the planet Earth) is a Legion of Super-Heroes member with the ability to unleash internal solar energy to whatever degree he wishes, from enough to light a single candle to enough to melt nearly any obstacle. Sun Boy first appeared in 1961 during the Silver Age of Comic Books. Publication history Sun Boy first appeared in Adventure Comics #276 and was created by Jerry Siegel and Jim Mooney. Fictional character biography=Silver Age the original version of Sun Boy Dirk Morgna's father owns a nuclear power plant, where Dirk works as a helper. While he is delivering supplies to one of the plant's scientists, Dr. Zaxton Regulus, the machine the scientist is working on explodes resulting in the death of fellow worker Zarl Hendricks. Dr. Regulus blames the accident, and his subsequent dismissal, on the interruption. He tries to gain revenge on Dirk by throwing him in an atomic reactor; however, due to Dirk's \\"one-in-a- million genetic structure\\" instead of killing him, the radiation gives him the power to generate heat and light. Dirk applies for the Legion, as Sun Boy, but is rejected as he has only demonstrated his ability to generate light. He is later accepted when he shows his heat-generation ability. =\\"Five Years Later\\"= During the \\"Five Year Gap\\" following the Magic Wars, Sun Boy becomes leader of the Legion amidst a series of defections which results in his resignation. Soon afterwards, Sun Boy is hired by Earthgov as a public relations liaison, using his good looks and popularity to spin public opinion. Earthgov is revealed to be under Dominator control and Dirk complies with their demands despite personal misgivings. When the truth is revealed, he is branded a traitor to the Legion and Earth. Dirk is later exposed to a fatal dose of radiation when a powersphere explodes next to him during the destruction of the Moon. He is killed by his sometime lover Circe,Circe is not to be confused with the sorceress Circe, who was a major adversary of Wonder Woman in the 20th and 21st centuries. in an act of euthanasia. His corpse is later animated for a short time by former teammate Wildfire. Shortly before Dirk's death, the members of the Dominators' highly classified \\"Batch SW6\\" escaped captivity. Originally, Batch SW6 appeared to be a group of teeange Legionnaire clones, created from samples apparently taken just prior to Ferro Lad's death at the hands of the Sun-Eater. Later, they were revealed to be time-paradox duplicates, every bit as legitimate as their older counterparts. After Earth was destroyed in a disaster reminiscent of the destruction of Krypton over a millennium earlier,Legion of Super-Heroes (Vol. 4) #38, Late December 1992. a few dozen surviving cities and their inhabitants reconstituted their world as New Earth. The SW6 Legionnaires remained, and their version of Sun Boy assumed the code name Inferno. Inferno made an appearance in Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds #5, among many Legionnaires from throughout the Multiverse. Post Zero Hour In post-Zero Hour continuity, Dirk Morgna is a supporting character, who occasionally gains \\"Sun Boy\\" powers, but is not a member of the Legion. Again blaming Dirk for his dismissal, Dr. Regulus attempts to kill Morgna by injecting him with radioactive gold. This instead causes him to glow white hot, blinding Regulus. He is unable to control this power and has to wear a special suit to protect others from it. While helping the Legion battle Regulus, he uses up all the energy and returns to normal. Dirk returns in Legionnaires #71 (May 1999), in which he is possessed by an elemental spirit called Ph'yr, one of the four Elements of Disaster, and turns into a living humanoid fireball. The elementals wish to gain Mordru's power. Dirk manages to regain control, and helps the Legion and the stone elemental Brika/Roxx defeat the two who had given themselves over to the elemental spirits. Threeboot In the 2004 revised Legion continuity, unlike the rest of his Legion comrades, Dirk Morgna's parents openly support the galactic movement the Legion represents. Joining the Legion as Sun Boy, Cosmic Boy names him the group's field leader. Confused as to whether or not his Legion membership is his desire or that of his parents, Dirk ultimately opts to resign from the group. He then decides to help the myriad of exiled descendants living in \\"otherspace\\" in the wake of the defeat of their leader, Praetor Lemnos. Ruefully, the Legion accedes to his request, but hope that Dirk will eventually return to their ranks. Dirk and his associates are kidnapped by the Dominators, who wish to steal their powers, but they are rescued by the Legion and the Wanderers. Sun Boy returns to the Legion and reveals that he has had all remaining members of Terra Firma arrested. His return is put to a vote per his request.Legion of Super-Heroes #48 (January 2009) This version of Sun Boy was killed by Superboy-Prime in Legion of Three Worlds #3. His body is later revived as part of the Black Lantern Corps in Adventure Comics (vol.2) #4. Post-Infinite Crisis The events of the Infinite Crisis miniseries have restored a close analogue of the Pre-Crisis on Infinite Earths Legion to continuity, as seen in \\"The Lightning Saga\\" story arc in Justice League of America and Justice Society of America, and in the \\"Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes\\" story arc in Action Comics. In the latter storyline, Sun Boy had been captured by Earth Man and plugged into a machine, which used his powers to turn many of the suns in the galaxy red. Sun Boy is later rescued by his teammates. Legion of Three Worlds In the Final Crisis: Legion of Three Worlds storyline, which follows on from Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes, Sun Boy is shown to have been deeply weakened and traumatised by his imprisonment, to the point where he cannot use his powers anymore. To this end, Dirk hands in his Flight Ring, effectively resigning from the Legion. In the course of the adventure, the other two Legions are pulled in to battle the Legion of Super-Villains. During the fight, the \\"Threeboot\\" Sun Boy is frozen solid and crushed to pieces by Superboy-Prime, causing the elder Dirk pain. Soon after, Dirk decides to don his flight ring again, and joins the fight, just in time to save Polar Boy from death at the hands of Superboy-Prime. Aftermath In the new Legion of Super-Heroes ongoing series, Sun Boy is one of many Legionnaires appalled by the Earth Government forcing the Legion to take on Earth-Man as a member. Still incensed over the way he was used, Sun Boy is steadfastly disgusted by Earth-Man's place on the team, even after the former criminal saves him from a Xenophobe attack.Legion of Super-Heroes #2 (June 2010) However, during an attack from the xenophobe group \\"Earthforce\\", Sun Boy saves Earth-Man from certain death, declaring that \\"The Legion takes care of its own.\\"Legion of Super-Heroes #5 (September 2010) Sun Boy perishes in a starcruiser crash on a strange planet; his body is later cooked and eaten by the planet's sentient inhabitants.\\"Legion of Super-Heroes\\" #17 (February 2013) In the \\"Watchmen\\" sequel \\"Doomsday Clock\\", Sun Boy is among the Legion of Super-Heroes members that appear in the present after Doctor Manhattan undid the experiment that erased the Legion of Super-Heroes and the Justice Society of America.Doomsday Clock #12 (December 2019). DC Comics. Powers and abilities Sun Boy can internally generate a seemingly limitless amount of electromagnetic radiation, both heat and visible light. He is also immune to virtually all forms of heat and radiation (except when he was killed off during the \\"Five-Year-Gap\\" era). Weaknesses Sun Boy's power to radiate light and heat can be reflected back on him by mirrors, jewels and creatures that are reflective. If he increases his radiating power to full strength he can crack mirrors in these situations. One limit to his power is that he cannot risk melting metal in proximity to any persons, since the intense heat required would be lethal.Sun Boy of the Legion of Super-Heroes Though it rarely came up given his ability, Dirk was revealed to suffer from nyctophobia. Equipment As a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes he is provided a Legion Flight Ring. It allows him to fly and protects him from the vacuum of space and other dangerous environments. It has been modified by Brainiac 5 to be heat resistant. In other media Sun Boy appears in the Legion of Super Heroes animated series, in the two part episode \\"Sundown\\" and \\"Cry Wolf\\" in Season Two as well as multiple other episodes in Season Two (in addition to the Season Two titles). His overall appearance somewhat differs from his comic book counterpart. His hair is longer, his forearms and the back of his hair light up on fire when he flies or uses his powers, leaving a fiery trail when he flies, and his eyes are black with gold pupils; similar to Superman X. His costume however is similar to his original costume. In \\"Cry Wolf\\", when Timber Wolf provokes the patrons in the bar he had fallen into, after Superman X used his heat vision to make a hole in the floor were Timberwolf was standing, to attack the Legion in retaliation to the impending attack, Sun Boy melted all of the attackers' weapons with a wave of his arm; before this he melted the door to the bar and entered followed by Colossal Boy. He also appears in the Season Two finale and plays a somewhat major role. He along with Cosmic Boy and Lightning Lad form a single file and use their powers to create a huge gash in Brainiac 5's giant robot form. Despite this he is defeated when Lightning Lad's arm cannon is taken over by Brainiac 5. He was defeated with a single lightning blast to the chest as was Cosmic Boy. He is digitized along with Cosmic Boy and Lightning Lad. At the end of the episode however he is returned to normal like all of the other Legionnaires. Despite his regular appearances in the program, he has yet to utter a single word onscreen; the most he has uttered are grunts and cries of pain. He has been called by name in one episode; this was during the two part Season One finale when Bouncing Boy yells out: \\"Sun Boy now!\\" telling him to use his heat generation power to draw the Sun-Eater to him. During the same episode Bouncing Boy again states his name saying that the Sun-Eater is falling for their trap by being drawn to Sun Boy's heat powers. He also appears in the episode \\"In the Beginning\\", where he appears at the end reciting the Legion oath.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. The church contains much cast iron in its structure, and its citation in the National Heritage List for England states it has \\"one of the earliest and most thorough uses of industrial materials in a major building\\". It is an active Anglican parish church in the diocese of Liverpool, the archdeaconry of Liverpool, and the deanery of Toxteth and Wavertree. Its benefice is united with those of Christ Church, Toxteth Park, and St Andrew, Liverpool. History The church was built between 1813 and 1815 as a chapel of ease to St Mary's Church, Walton. The church was built by John Cragg, the owner of the Mersey Iron Foundry, Tithebarn Street, Liverpool. Cragg bought the land from the Earl of Sefton, and built the church at his own expense, its final cost being ¬£7,865 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). Cragg was a keen churchman and was always looking for new ways to use cast iron. He had already starting building St George's Church, Everton, using cast iron in its structure. and he planned to use more of it in St Michael's. Here it was used in the construction of the walls and for the pinnacles. The cast iron in the walls formed a skeleton, the base of which was filled with slate, and the remainder with brick. The brick was stuccoed. Internally he used it for the columns, for the tracery of the ceiling, and for mouldings. Cragg worked with the architect Thomas Rickman on the design of both churches, although the relationship between the two was not always happy. The church was consecrated by the Bishop of Chester (George Henry Law) on 21 June 1815. By the late 1860s the structure of the building had deteriorated so much that it was in danger of demolition. However one of the churchwardens, Colonel Thomas Wilson organised a restoration of the church, the architects being W. and G. Audsley. The box pews were removed and replaced with benches providing a centre aisle as well as the two side aisles, the floor was relaid, and a new heating system was installed. Further improvements were made in the following years. In July 1898 St Michael's became a parish in its own right. By this time the building was not large enough for its congregation, and in 1897 a faculty had been obtained to extend the church. The north wall was removed and replaced further out, thereby increasing the width of the church. A new porch was built, a vestry was created in the former porch, and access to the west gallery was moved from the north to the south side. The cost for this was ¬£2,950 (equivalent to ¬£ in ), which was raised by the parishioners. In 1902 the organ was moved from the west gallery to a position north of the chancel. Following the First World War, the money collected to celebrate the church's centenary in 1915 was used instead was used for improvements to the church. It was used to redecorate the interior, for the provision of a clock in the tower, and for a memorial window in the porch. In 1957 the Jubilee Chapel was created at the east end of the south aisle to commemorate the diamond jubilee of the Mothers' Union. A further renovation took place in 1984 when the pipe organ, that had been damaged by water, was replaced with an electronic organ. The oak reredos was removed from the sanctuary and the lower tier of stained glass was replaced in the east window. The gallery was converted into a choir vestry with a glass screen overlooking the interior of the church. Its cost was ¬£8,000. Structure The church is built in brick with many cast iron components; these include the parapets, battlements and pinnacles. The roofs are of slate slabs in a cast-iron framework. The plinth consists of a cast iron frame with slate covering. Its plan consists of a six-bay nave with clerestory, north and south aisles (the north aisle being wider than the south), a west tower, and a short chancel with a vestry to the north and a chapel to the south. The aisles, clerestory and tower have three-light windows with Perpendicular tracery. The tower also has paired three-light bell-openings, diagonal buttresses, an arcaded, embattled parapet and pinnacles. Inside is a six-bay arcade with cast iron columns. The windows are also made from cast iron. An organ occupies the east bay of the north aisle and there is a west gallery. Fittings and furnishings The stained glass in the east window is in early Gothic Revival style. The east window in the chapel dates from 1916 and is by Shrigley and Hunt. In the porch is a First World War memorial window with glass by H. Gustave Hiller. The font is in marble. In the church is a marble tablet to the memory of the astronomer Jeremiah Horrox who was born nearby.

As of 2016 the brand also manufactures coffee machines for Nespresso, including the Inissia, Bambino and Citiz series of machines.  History  An assortment of Breville appliances In 1932, Bill O'Brien and Harry Norville (born Charles Henry Norville) mixed their last names together and the Breville brand was created. They started off making radios, then mine detectors for the war. After World War II and the commencement of television transmission in Australia in 1956, Breville turned its attention to small appliances. It also commenced manufacturing television sets under the Precedent brand name. The television business was sold to Electronic Industries Limited in 1955. The O'Brien family continued developing the Breville business for three generations, with Bill's son John O'Brien setting up the Breville Research and Development centre in the late 1960s, and his daughter Barbara, running the Marketing department throughout the 1990s. John continued to lead many product development initiatives For the Breville brand up until his death in December 2003. Breville's R&D; team has over 100 active patents and has been awarded more than 40 international design awards. In 1974, it completed development of the toastie maker. The product was a huge success upon its launch in Australia in 1974, selling 400,000 units in its first year and making the Breville brand a household name in Australia. Soon after, the Breville toasted sandwich maker was launched in New Zealand and the United Kingdom where it met with similar success.  European ownership  In 1982, Breville Australia sold its ownership of the brand in Europe, which today is owned by Newell Brands. In Europe, Breville works with partners who use their own brands for local marketing. These brands are Sage Appliances (Eastern and Western Europe), Solis (Western Europe), Riviera & Bar (solely in France), Gastroback, and Bork (Eastern Europe and Russia). Breville has collaborated with Antony Worrall Thompson. Pulse manages its own product development and is no longer affiliated with Breville's Centre of Design Excellence in Australia.

Hristo Tatarchev (Macedonian and ; December 16, 1869 ‚Äì January 5, 1952) was a Bulgarian doctor and revolutionary,In Salonica, in November 1893, four teachers, a bookseller, and a physician founded the most famous Macedonian organization. Its exact name is disputed. Initially it was called Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (MRO), but in 1896 it assumed the title Bulgarian Macedo-Adrianopolitan Revolutionary Committees (BMORK) and membership was open to ‚Äòany Bulgarian‚Äô who desired to serve the ‚Äòcause‚Äô, namely liberation from the Turkish yoke and the political autonomy of Macedonia. The much-praised autonomist solution must not be taken atface value; autonomy meant preservation of the territorial integrity of Macedonia which could eventually lead to incorporation of the region into Bulgaria. A convenient precedent had been already established by the annexation of Eastern Rumelia to Bulgaria in 1885. Besides, any proposal for direct annexation of Macedonia would have met with the refusal of the Great Powers. According to Christo Tatarchev this was the reason which forced them to put forward the idea of ‚Äòautonomy‚Äô instead of ‚Äòannexation‚Äô. Dimitris Livanios, The Macedonian Question: Britain and the Southern Balkans 1939-1949, Oxford Historical Monographs, OUP Oxford, 2008, , p. 17.The modern Macedonian historiographic equation of IMRO demands for autonomy with a separate and distinct national identity does not necessarily jibe with the historical record. A rather obvious problem is the very title of the organization, which included Thrace in addition to Macedonia. Thrace whose population was never claimed by modern Macedonian nationalism... There is, moreover, the not less complicated issue of what autonomy meant to the people who espoused it in their writings. According to Hristo Tatarchev, their demand for autonomy was motivated not by an attachment to Macedonian national identity but out of concern that an explicit agenda of unification with Bulgaria would provoke other small Balkan nations and the Great Powers to action. Macedonian autonomy, in other words, can be seen as a tactical diversion, or as ‚ÄúPlan B‚Äù of Bulgarian unification. ƒ∞pek Yosmaoƒülu, Blood Ties: Religion, Violence and the Politics of Nationhood in Ottoman Macedonia, 1878‚Äì1908, Cornell University Press, 2013, , pp. 15-16.Autonomy for Macedonia and the vilayet of Adrianople (southern Thrace) became the key demand for a generation of Slavic activists. In October 1893, a group of them founded the Bulgarian Macedono-Adrianopolitan Revolutionary Committee in Salonica...It engaged in creating a network of secretive committees and armed guerrillas in the two regions as well as in Bulgaria, where an ever-growing and politically influential Macedonian and Thracian diaspora resided. Heavily influenced by the ideas of early socialism and anarchism, the IMARO activists saw the future autonomous Macedonia as a multinational polity, and did not pursue the self- determination of Macedonian Slavs as a separate ethnicity. Therefore, Macedonian (and also Adrianopolitan) was an umbrella term covering Bulgarians, Turks, Greeks, Vlachs, Albanians, Serbs, Jews, and so on. While this message was taken aboard by many Vlachs as well as some Patriarchist Slavs, it failed to impress other groups for whom the IMARO remained ‚Äò‚Äòthe Bulgarian Committee.‚Äô‚Äô Historical Dictionary of Republic of Macedonia, Historical Dictionaries of Europe, Dimitar Bechev, Scarecrow Press, 2009, , Introduction.–¢–∞—Ç–∞—Ä—á–µ–≤, –•—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–æ. –°–ø–æ–º–µ–Ω–∏, –¥–æ–∫—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∏, –º–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∞–ª–∏, –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è 1989, —Å. 68, 75 (Tatarchev, Hristo.

He wrote a memoirs called The First Central Committee of the IMRO (1928). Tatarchev authored several political journalism works between the First and Second World War. According to post-WWII Macedonian historiography, he was an ethnic Macedonian.The origins of the official Macedonian national narrative are to be sought in the establishment in 1944 of the Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. This open acknowledgment of the Macedonian national identity led to the creation of a revisionist historiography whose goal has been to affirm the existence of the Macedonian nation through the history. Macedonian historiography is revising a considerable part of ancient, medieval, and modern histories of the Balkans. Its goal is to claim for the Macedonian peoples a considerable part of what the Greeks consider Greek history and the Bulgarians Bulgarian history. The claim is that most of the Slavic population of Macedonia in the 19th and first half of the 20th century was ethnic Macedonian. For more see: Victor Roudometof, Collective Memory, National Identity, and Ethnic Conflict: Greece, Bulgaria, and the Macedonian Question, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002, , p. 58; Victor Roudometof, Nationalism and Identity Politics in the Balkans: Greece and the Macedonian Question in Journal of Modern Greek Studies 14.2 (1996) 253-301.Yugoslav Communists recognized the existence of a Macedonian nationality during WWII to quiet fears of the Macedonian population that a communist Yugoslavia would continue to follow the former Yugoslav policy of forced Serbianization. Hence, for them to recognize the inhabitants of Macedonia as Bulgarians would be tantamount to admitting that they should be part of the Bulgarian state. For that the Yugoslav Communists were most anxious to mold Macedonian history to fit their conception of Macedonian consciousness. The treatment of Macedonian history in Communist Yugoslavia had the same primary goal as the creation of the Macedonian language: to de-Bulgarize the Macedonian Slavs and to create a separate national consciousness that would inspire identification with Yugoslavia. For more see: Stephen E. Palmer, Robert R. King, Yugoslav communism and the Macedonian question, Archon Books, 1971, , Chapter 9: The encouragement of Macedonian culture.\\"However, contrary to the impression of researchers who believe that the Internal organization espoused a \\"Macedonian national consciousness,\\" the local revolutionaries declared their conviction that the \\"majority\\" of the Christian population of Macedonia is \\"Bulgarian.\\" They clearly rejected possible allegations of what they call \\"national separatism\\" vis-a-vis the Bulgarians, and even consider it \\"immoral.\\" Though they declared an equal attitude towards all the \\"Macedonian populations.\\" Tschavdar Marinov, We the Macedonians, The Paths of Macedonian Supra- Nationalism (1878‚Äì1912), in \\"We, the People: Politics of National Peculiarity in Southeastern Europe\\" with Mishkova Diana as ed., Central European University Press, 2009, , pp. 107-137. Tatarchev was born in the town of Resen in Ottoman Macedonia to a rich family. His father Nikola Tatarchev was a successful banker, and his mother Katerina was a descendant of a prominent family. Hristo Tatarchev received his initial education in Resen, then he moved to Eastern Rumelia and studied in Bratsigovo (1882) and eventually at the Secondary school for boys in Plovdiv (1883‚Äì87). It was at that time when he participated in the Unification of Bulgaria and enrolled in a students' legion, which took part in the Serbo-Bulgarian War of 1885. Tatarchev was expelled from school because of \\"insubordination\\" and he moved to Romania, where he continued his secondary education. Later he studied medicine at the University of Zurich (1887‚Äì1890) and completed his degree in Medicine in Berlin (July 1892). He moved to Thessaloniki in 1892, where he worked as physician at the local Bulgarian secondary school for boys. He was a founding member of the Bulgarian Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Committee (renamed to IMARO in 1906), which was established on October 23, 1893 in Thessaloniki. In the following year he was elected President of the Central Committee of IMARO. Tatarchev participated in the Thessaloniki Congress of BMARC in 1896. In early 1901 he was caught by the Ottoman authorities and sent into exile for 5 years in Bodrum Castle in Asia Minor. Although he was granted amnesty on August 19, 1902, Tatarchev did not give up revolutionary fight and in August 1902 he became a representative of the Foreign Committee of the IMRO in Sofia. Being such, he met with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Russia, Vladimir Lamsdorf (1845‚Äì1907), who had arrived in Bulgaria at the end of 1902. Tatarchev presented Lamsdorf with an IMARO-designed plan of reforms to be introduced in Macedonia. Tatarchev and Vladimir Lamsdorf organised a meeting to review the revolutionary ideas which could result in a successful revolt. During the Ilinden‚ÄìPreobrazhenie Uprising of 1903, Tatarchev guided the revolutionary fight, as the emigrant representation turned out to be the sole governing body of the organization. To his credit, Tatarchev did not desert the revolutionary campaign when the uprising was quelled. Later he came in conflict with the supporters of Yane Sandanski and did not participate in the activities of the IMRO to the Kyustendil Congress in March 1908, where he was appointed as an adviser to the Foreign Committee of the IMRO. After the Young Turk Revolution he openly supported the Union of the Bulgarian Constitutional Clubs, but did not participate in its activities. In 1910 he was elected a reserve member of the Central Committee of IMRO. When Bulgaria entered the Balkan Wars and the First World War, Tatarchev was sent to the front as a regimental physician. At the end of the wars he was one of the initiators of the Temporary representation of the former IMARO. In the fall of 1920 he entered the Macedonian Federative Organization. Shortly after that Tatarchev was forced to emigrate in Italy, because of significant discord between then IMRO's leader Todor Alexandrov and him. He lived briefly in his native Resen during the Second World War, when Macedonia was annexed of Bulgaria (1941‚Äì1944). Later he returned to Sofia, but in 1943 after the bombings there Tatarchev moved to Nova Zagora. He was offered in 1944 from the Germans to become a President of the Independent State of Macedonia, but he refused, because the Red Army was entering Bulgaria. Bulgaria also ordered its troops to prepare for withdrawal from former Yugoslavia.–ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω—Å–∫–∞—Ç–∞ –∫—ä—Ä–≤–∞–≤–∞ –ö–æ–ª–µ–¥–∞. –°—ä–∑–¥–∞–≤–∞–Ω–µ –∏ —É—Ç–≤—ä—Ä–∂–¥–∞–≤–∞–Ω–µ –Ω–∞ –í–∞—Ä–¥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∞ –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω–∏—è –∫–∞—Ç–æ –†–µ–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–∞ –≤ –Æ–≥–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤—Å–∫–∞ –§–µ–¥–µ—Ä–∞—Ü–∏—è (1943-1946) –ê–≤—Ç–æ—Ä: –í–µ—Å–µ–ª–∏–Ω –ê–Ω–≥–µ–ª–æ–≤, –ò–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª: –ò–ö \\"–ì–∞–ª–∏–∫ \\", , —Å—Ç—Ä. 113 - 115. Because of the communist regime imposed in Bulgaria and Yugoslavia Tatarchev moved to Turin again, where he died on January 5, 1952. In December 2009, his mortal remains were brought from Turin to Bulgaria by VMRO-BND, a contemporary national political party claiming descent from the IMRO. Tatarchev's reburial took place in Sofia, on October 23, 2010, exactly 117 years since the founding of the IMRO.

Built in 1704 and extensively renovated in 1772 by the influential architect Robert Adam the building is praised as the finest example of Robert Adam's work in Northern England. Throughout its 300-year history the building has been the residence of a number of notable figures, including the Earl of Sefton and Liverpool shipowner Frederick Richards Leyland. During the later part of the 20th century the building went through a number of uses eventually becoming a school in the 1950s and later being abandoned with plans for its demolition. A campaign against its destruction was successful and the hall is now a Grade I listed building. History Early records indicate that the land of Woolton Hall had been occupied since 1180 when the area of Much Woolton (now called Woolton) came under the lordship of the holy Catholic order of the Knights Hospitaller who held the land for almost 360 years until the English Reformation. In the 16th century, Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries suppressed the Knights Hospitaller leading the land being confiscated and then further restored by Mary I. The land was permanently confiscated from the order in 1559 under Elizabeth I and was kept by the crown until 1609. Eventually the land came under ownership of the Brettarghs of Holt who was reputed to have acquired it from an ancient family named de Woolton. On the death of William Brettargh in 1609 the land was described as a cottage. Sometime between 1700 and 1704 the house and surrounding estate was sold to politician Richard Molyneux, 1st Viscount Molyneux, who built the northern block of the hall. A 1781 Watercolour of Woolton Hall by Paul Sandby In 1772 Woolton Hall was acquired by Nicholas Ashton, a former High Sheriff of Lancashire, whose father was one of the original undertakers and the principal financier of the Sankey Canal, the first canal of the British industrial revolution. Shortly afterwards Ashton commissioned the noted architect Robert Adam to remodel and expand the building extensively. Nicholas Ashton died in 1833 leaving the house to his son Joseph Ashton who in turn left it to his son Charles Ellis Ashton. Charles Ellis later sold the house in 1865 to James Reddecliffe Jeffery who was the owner of Liverpool's largest department store Compton House, located on Church Street. A fire at the store on 1 December 1865 destroyed much of Jeffery's uninsured stock eventually leading to the business failing. Jeffery put the house up for action in 1869 but failed to find a buyer until 1877 when Liverpool shipowner Frederick Richards Leyland purchased the house for ¬£19,000 moving with his family from nearby Speke Hall Leyland who was somewhat of an art enthusiast decorated the house with paintings of varying styles including Edward Burne-Jones's Night and Day and Ford Madox Brown's The Entombment. Leyland later sold the building to the McGuffies a family of shipowners who demolished the west wing and converted it into a Hydropathic Hotel. After living there for some 30 years the hotel closed in 1912 After a short spell as the headquarters of the Middlesex Regiment and as an army hospital in the 1950s the building was converted into a fee-paying girls' school under the management of the Convent of Notre Dame. In 1970 the small school merged with Notre Dame High School located on Mount Pleasant to form Notre Dame Woolton (now St Julie's Catholic High School). As the school expanded new modern buildings were built nearby leading to Woolton Hall to be abandoned. Soon the building fell into disrepair, eventually being marked for demolition in the 1980s. The building was saved after local resident John Hibbert purchased the Hall and spent ¬£100,000 in refurbishments, soon after Woolton Hall become a Grade I listed building on 28 June 1982. In 2005, there were plans to convert the estate and house into retirement care flats.

The windows, although now boarded up have architraves and are sashed with glazing bars. The facade of the building was re-fronted in 1865 by Robert Adams to include a Porte-coch√®re which covers the entrance. This consists of 4 paired Doric columns between rusticated antae, entablature and balustrade. Interior Passing through the front entrance is a large lobby flanked by two main halls. The lobby has marble flooring and an imposing oak fireplace which is one of the buildings original features, having been designed by Robert Adams. Adjacent to the fireplace are three doors with the leftmost allowing access to a kitchen area and a stairwell. The door directly to the fireplace's left leads to an octagonal shaped turquoise room with and a decorated ceiling that contains a circular painting of Frederic Leighton's The Garden of the Hesperides. The door on the right leads to the building's main staircase. Regarding the two main halls, the left side hall is a function room with two full-length windows, a stone set bar and fireplace and a back kitchen area. The hall's ceiling is decorated with painted with gold foliage centred around a bust of a man dressed in 18th- century clothing. On the right side of the building is a dance hall and adjoining tapestry room with high ceilings and oak panelled walls. The dance hall with two large front facing windows is decorated with paintings of previous residents and a large painting of Queen Ann which sits above a brick fireplace. Next to this is a wooden bar area that leads into the tapestry room while at the room's centre is a Parquet dance floor which has been damaged to reveal stone flooring underneath. The tapestry room is an elongated semi- circular area decorated with mostly Flemish paintings and two glass candle- style chandeliers. Set back to back with the dance hall's fireplace is another fireplace creating a mirror image, this time with a portrait of King George III hanging above. The principal staircase which ascends to the second floor is another of Robert Adam's original features consisting of wrought iron baluster and a moulded mahogany handrail. The upper floors boast large opens rooms with original Robert Adams ceilings as well many smaller rooms which have acted as bedrooms and classrooms throughout the building's history. Gallery The hall contains a number of replica paintings including those of former residents, most of the originals have since been relocated to the Walker Art Gallery.

Formerly the lead guitarist for the anarcho-punk and folk band Chumbawamba, he is now a playwright and the founder of Commoners Choir who released their first album in March 2017. Early life and education Whalley was born Allan Mark Whalley in 1961 in Burnley, Lancashire. Before joining Chumbawamba he attended Art College in Maidstone and worked in a supermarket and as a postman. His parents were both primary school teachers. Career Together with his fellow members of Chimp Eats Banana; Midge (Michael Hartley) and Danbert Nobacon, he moved from Burnley to Leeds in 1981, and studied at the University of Leeds, dropping out after a year before moving into the South View House squat in Armley. It was at this squat that he was part of an Anarchist collective that later became the band Chumbawamba. The band in the early 1980s, was a hardcore punk band in the style of DC Punk, or LA Punk. In 1984, when the British coal mining industry was privatised by Margaret Thatcher's government and the National Union of Mineworkers began protesting, Chumbawamba became even more politically active in equal rights and labour rights. He became a guitarist despite describing himself as being of \\"limited ability\\". He continued to play guitar and sing while doing a series of other jobs such as shopworker, newspaper delivery man, typesetter, and cartoonist. In 2013, he wrote a musical drama \\"Wrong 'Un\\" which was performed in Norwich. It was based on the life of suffragette Grace Marcon.  Fell running  Beyond his musical career, Whalley has been prominent in the fell running scene, particularly in West Yorkshire, running at a relatively high standard. Touring and recording commitments have influenced the extent to which he has been able to pursue this activity. He was instrumental in the production of the Fellternative fell running fanzine in the early 1990s. Whalley recorded a song called \\"Stud Marks on the Summits\\", inspired by a chance meeting with legendary fell runner Bill Smith. Whalley took up fell running as a result. He was paraphrased as having said Smith \\"encapsulated the ethos of the sport ‚Äì its emphasis on self-reliance and nature and its history.\\" Books Whalley has published two books: * Footnote*, autobiography (2004) * Run Wild, an account of his experiences as a fell runner (2012) References Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:People from Burnley Category:English anarchists Category:English rock guitarists Category:Chumbawamba members Category:British fell runners ","title":"Boff Whalley"},{"id":"1505796","text":"Abba Schoengold (also Shoengold, Shongold, or Sheingold) was a Romanian Jewish actor in the early years of Yiddish theater, the first person to score a serious reputation as a dramatic actor in Yiddish.  Biography  A singer in the synagogue choir of the leading synagogue in Bucharest, Romania, Schoengold had also performed in a quartet with Sigmund Mogulesko, playing at weddings and parties. He failed an audition in 1877 for Abraham Goldfaden's nascent Yiddish theater company (which Mogulesko joined). Within a year, he had joined the troupe of playwright Moses Halevy-Hurvitz, which toured through rural Romania and eventually to Chi≈üinƒÉu, where his performance supposedly inspired David Kessler's interest in theater. He then travelled on his own to Odessa, Ukraine. In 1882, at the Mariinsky Theater in Odessa, he scored a triumph in the first Yiddish-language production of Karl Gutzkow's Uriel Acosta. Jacob Adler writes that at this time he was \\"the god of the Yiddish public, the god, indeed, of all who saw him on stage... the handsomest man in the world. Tall. Blue eyes. Golden hair. An Apollo.\\" [Adler, 1999, 221] Adler also writes that he had \\"a mania for adding to his costume... a plume, a feather, a cape, a scarf, ... medals\\". [Adler, 1999, 269] With his wife Clara Schoengold, he followed much of the Yiddish theater community to London in the mid-1880s and thence to New York City. Their son Joseph married Adler's daughter Frances in New York in 1911; both went on to be leading lights of the Yiddish stage.

The specific medical terms mentoplasty and genioplasty are used to refer to the reduction and addition of material to a patient's chin. This can take the form of chin height reduction or chin rounding by osteotomy, or chin augmentation using implants. This operation is often, but not always, performed at the time of rhinoplasty to help balance the facial proportions. Chin augmentation may be achieved by manipulation of the jaw bone (mandible) and augmentation utilizing this technique usually provides a more dramatic correction than with the use of prosthetic implants. Chin implants are used to build a better profile.Aufricht, G: combined plastic surgery of the nose and chin; resume of twenty seven years' experiences. Am J Surg 1958 Feb;95(2): 231-6 Patients' own bone is donated from ribs and from part of the pelvis (the ilium). Use of donated bone implants in chin augmentation, even the patient‚Äôs own, appears to be associated with a higher rate of infection, even after the implant has been in place for decades. Chin augmentation is still popular because it is a relatively easy operation for the patient while producing noticeable changes in the silhouette of the face. This type of surgery is usually performed by an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, otolaryngologist, or plastic surgeon.  T-osteotomy method  T-osteotomy method (or mini V-line) is used to narrow and lengthen the chin using an osteotomy technique formulated by Korean surgeons. The surgery is performed under general anesthesia (orotracheal intubation) using an intraoral approach. Using a double-bladed reciprocating saw, a horizontal osteotomy is performed, leaving a small portion of bone in the middle. Then two vertical osteotomies are performed in an upside-down trapezoidal shape which is excised. The bones remaining from the horizontal osteotomy are then attached and adjusted to lengthen the chin, and advanced forward for an additional frontal chin projection if required. Pre-bent titanium plates and screws are used to fixate the bone to its new position. The chin can be lengthened 2 to 3 mm on average. The mentalis muscles controls the elevation functions of the lower lip and chin, so extra caution should be taken to carefully attach the mentalis muscle back after the surgery. Potential risks and side effects The usual complications are relatively minor and include swelling, hematoma (blood pooling), weakness or numbness of the lower lip, which usually does not last long. Other, less common risks include infection, bony changes and displacement of the implant.Costantino PD. FriedmanCD: Soft-tissue augmentation and replacement in the head and neck. General considerations, Ontolaryngol Clin North Am 1994 Feb;27(1): 1-12 Seeking an experienced surgeon can help reduce your risks of complications.White JB, Dufresne CR. Management and avoidance of complications in chin augmentation. Aesthet Surg J. 2011 Aug 1;31(6):634-42. Chewing should be kept at a minimum immediately after this procedure, and patients are recommended to eat only soft food and drink for a time after the surgery. Types of implants Silicone - Silicone chin Implants are one of the most commonly used implants for chin augmentation. They are soft, smooth, flexible and come in different shapes and sizes. They do not incorporate (stick) to the surrounding tissues, so the pocket must be made precisely. They usually stay in place, but may move, buckle and cause bone resorption where they contact the mandible in some cases. Since they are smooth, they can also be removed easily. Polyethylene - Polyethylene chin implants, brand name Medpor, are hard, porous, slightly flexible and come in various shapes and sizes. The do incorporate, as the surrounding tissues can grow into the pores of the material. This fixes the polyethylene chin implants in place, and provides a blood supply to help prevent infection. It also makes these implants much more difficult to remove. Polytetrafluoroethylene - Polytetrafluoroethylene, brand name Gore-Tex, is used in plastic surgery and other operations is known by an abbreviation of its chemical name, ePTFE (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene) or Gore S.A.M. (subcutaneous augmentation material).Gore Medical Products Maas CS, Merwin GE, Wilson J, et al.: Comparison of biomaterials for facial augmentation. Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg 1990 May; 116(5): 551-6. Because ePTFE is flexible and soft but very strong, it is inserted during operations in trimmed sheets and carved blocks and held to the bone by titanium screws. But because the material is porous, the force that really holds the implant in place is soft tissue and bone growing through and into the implant. The above artificial materials are used in medicine because they are biocompatible and have a low incidence of causing problems inside the human body. They are abundant, FDA cleared and can be used \\"off-the-shelf\\", without a donor site injury to the recipient. Acellular dermal matrix - ADMs are another chin augmentation implant material. Commercially known as AlloDerm and known to physicians as acellular human cadaveric dermis, AlloDerm comes from tissue donors Just after death, technicians remove a layer of skin, remove the epidermis, and treat the remaining dermis with antibiotics and other substances to remove the donor's cells and DNA that would cause rejection. The graft that emerges is often used to cover chin implants. Other implant materials include Supramid, a braided nonabsorbable synthetic suture material in polymer shell and Mersiline, a mesh-like material that provides a scaffold on the bone.Guyuron B, Raszewski RL: A critical comparison of osteoplasic and alloplastic augmentation genioplasty. Aesthetic Plast Surg 1990 Summer, 14(3): 199-206 Types of procedures Surgical chin augmentation - The most common type of surgical chin augmentation uses a chin implant. There are many types of chin implants, and many are described in the previous section. Chin augmentation with a chin implant is usually a cosmetic procedure. An incision is made either under the chin or inside the lower lip, a pocket is made and the implant placed into the pocket. Some chin implants are fixed to the mandible, while others are held in place by the pocket itself. Another surgical chin augmentation uses the lower prominence of the mandible as the \\"implant.\\" Known as a sliding genioplasty, the procedure involves cutting a horseshoe-shaped piece of bone from the lower border of the mandible known as an osteotomy. For chin augmentation, the piece of bone is advanced forward to increase to projection of the chin. The piece can also be recessed backward for a chin reduction. The new position is held in place with a titanium step plate using titanium screws. The bone segment can also be fixated with 26 or 27 gauge wires and IMF (wiring the jaw shut) for 3-4weeks. This type of surgery is usually performed by an oral and maxillofacial surgeon or a plastic surgeon. More involved Orthognathic Surgery may be required in cases where the chin is small and a significant overbite co-exist. While the procedures above may improve the cosmetic appearance of the chin, they will not improve dental occlusion. Mandibular advancement surgery can be used to correct the alignment of the teeth and improve the projection of the chin. Non-surgical chin augmentation - Another method of chin augmentation uses an injectable filler. Most fillers are temporary, with results lasting months to years. Common temporary fillers include hyaluronic acid and calcium hydroxyapatite preparations. Permanent fillers, like \\"free\\" silicone, have fallen out of favor due to the risk of migration, chronic inflammation and infection, which can permanently disfigure the chin.

He completed training at the Senior Management Institute for Police and graduated from the FBI National Academy, 145th Session in June 1986. Police work In 1976, √Ålvarez joined the Miami- Dade Police Department. He was promoted through the ranks and, in 1997, became director of the MDPD. He served as director from 1997 to 2004. His tenure as director was called \\"relatively free of trouble, at least by local standards\\" by the Miami New Times, although in 2004 a group of policemen who served in the department described his management style as marked by \\"favoritism and retaliation\\". Mayoralty Carlos √Ålvarez ran for mayor in the 2004 Miami- Dade mayoral election, and defeated his opponent Jimmy L. Morales. He became Miami-Dade County's sixth mayor, replacing Alex Penelas.

In August 2009, The Miami Herald revealed that Alvarez had recently given pay raises to close aides, including his chief of staff Dennis Morales, whose new salary was over $200,000 a year. In September 2010, Alvarez pushed for a 12% increase in the property tax rate. Recall An effort to recall Alvarez began in October 2010, backed by billionaire businessman Norman Braman, a former owner of the Philadelphia Eagles, over Alvarez's simultaneous tax increases and pay raises for upper echelon county workers. Braman spent more than $1 million of his own money on the effort. Alvarez was recalled in a March 15, 2011 election. More than 88% of the voters (some 176,000 people) voted for recalling Alvarez. The election was the largest municipal recall vote in United States history, and the second largest in the U.S. of any kind after the 2003 recall election of California governor Gray Davis. He officially left office on March 18, 2011 when the county canvassing board certified the results. Personal life √Ålvarez is the father of two sons and one daughter.

In 1966, a second store \\"ShopKo East\\" was opened on Main Street, in Green Bay's east side, followed by several other locations in the state in the following years. In September 1969, the first ShopKo store in Michigan opened, in Marquette. 1970s In June 1970, Ruben announced plans for corporate headquarters on Ashland Avenue in Ashwaubenon, Wisconsin. In that same month, ShopKo Corp. was renamed \\"ShopKo Stores, Inc.\\" In January 1971, the firm announced plans to merge with SuperValu of Minneapolis. Also in 1971, the new Ashwaubenon headquarters opened. The merger with SuperValu was completed in April 1971. In August 1971, ShopKo announced plans to start putting pharmacies in its stores. In September 1972, Ruben left the company to become president of SuperValu, and William Tyrrell succeeded him. In 1977, ShopKo topped $100 million in sales.

Many stores continued to use this logo until they closed. In 1990, ShopKo opened its 100th store, including its first venture in California. In mid-1991, SuperValu announced that ShopKo would become a publicly traded company. The stock debuted at $15 a share. Dale Kramer also took over the reins of the company in 1991. In late 1991, ShopKo introduced a \\"Vision 2000\\" prototype model, which opened in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, Duluth, Minnesota, Dixon, Illinois, Loveland, Colorado, Longmont, Colorado, and Lacey, Washington, and relocated stores in Marshall, Minnesota, and Mitchell, South Dakota. In 1996, ShopKo announced plans to merge with Phar-Mor, an Ohio-based chain, but those plans were later called off. In 1997, Shopko acquired Penn-Daniels Inc. and its eighteen Jacks Discount Stores. Also in 1997, Phar-Mor split from ShopKo, and ShopKo bought out all of SuperValu's stock in the company. ShopKo also banned all tobacco products from its stores. In 1998 the company acquired Venture Stores in Kentucky, Iowa, Missouri, Illinois and Kansas. In 1999, William Podany became President of ShopKo. He led the acquisition of 147 Pamida stores later that year. ShopKo also launched spin-off pharmaceutical company ProVantage on to the stock market. The 1999 \\"Beyond 2000\\" prototype store in Meridian, Idaho in April 2006 (closed in February 2017) Late in 1999, ShopKo opened its first test prototype store in Meridian, Idaho, named \\"Beyond 2000,\\" referring to ShopKo's Beyond 2000 merchandising strategy, the successor to the Vision 2000 strategy of the early 1990s. 2000s In March 2000, shares of ShopKo hit a record $3.57, up 70% from the year before. Later that year, the firm announced that it would sell ProVantage to Merck & Co. for about $222 million. In May 2000, ShopKo agreed to buy P.M. Place Stores, a 49-location chain, for $22 million, with plans to convert those locations to Pamidas. Early in 2001, ShopKo announced the closings of 23 stores and a distribution center, cutting 2,500 jobs and bowing out of Missouri, Indiana, Kansas, and Kentucky. In April 2002 the company's CEO, William Podany, resigned. Jeffrey Girard became his interim replacement, until Sam Duncan took over in October. In 2005, ShopKo opened the first few \\"ShopKo Express\\" locations, which were smaller, and aimed at competition with Walgreens and CVS Pharmacy. Around that time, the chain exited the state of Colorado (some locations were acquired by JCPenney), and closed its Reno, Nevada location. Late in 2005, ShopKo was acquired by Sun Capital Partners. In May 2006, Michael MacDonald took over as CEO. In 2007, Pamida spun off from ShopKo. Also in 2007, ShopKo rebranded, dropping the capital camel case 'K' in its name and introducing a new logo., but Shopko Express stores retained the older style until fall 2008. In 2008, Shopko Express expanded into urban markets with the opening of a Green Bay, Wisconsin location, but this store was shuttered less than a year after it was opened. During the late 2000s, ShopKo started to anchor more shopping centers, such as the ones in Suamico, Wisconsin and North Branch, Minnesota. In April 2009, Michael MacDonald resigned as CEO, to become CEO of DSW, Inc., and was replaced by W. Paul Jones. In late 2009, Shopko started online shopping service. 2010s In May 2010, Shopko outsourced its IT services to HCL Technologies, based in Chennai, India.Shopko to outsource IT operation In the summer of 2010, Shopko opened its first two \\"Shopko Hometown\\" stores, which were converted from Pamida locations. In 2011, Shopko placed even more emphasis on its Hometown subsidiary, opening nine new locations and closing regular stores to focus on the Hometown stores. In 2012, a decade after it spun off from Shopko, Pamida merged with Shopko; all Pamida stores were rebranded as Shopko Hometown stores. The total cost for the remodel was estimated at $80 million. Later in 2012, W. Paul Jones resigned from the company's top post and Mike Bettiga took over as interim CEO. In 2013, Peter McMahon was named Shopko's new CEO.\\"Peter McMahon Named Shopko's New CEO\\", PRNewswire, November 25, 2013. Retrieved November 25, 2013.

It was well established during the Middle Ages, spreading south into the counties of Monaghan, Meath, Roscommon and Offaly.

In the summer of 1803 it left Montreal for Hudson Bay. At the same time a force under Angus Shaw left the Tadoussac area for James Bay. They met at Charlton Island in HBC territory and claimed the island for the NWC. They built Fort St. Andrews there and two forts at the mouths of the Moose River and Eastmain River. The purpose, in part, was to pressure the HBC into granting the NWC transit rights through Hudson Bay. What happened after that is not clear.

M. de Gruyter, Beginning in the late 13th century, numerous Georgian princes and kings took the name Vakhtang. Toumanoff observes that the name Vakhtang has no Classical equivalent and infers that the king's sobriquet Gorgasal‚Äîgiven to Vakhtang because of the shape of the helmet he wore‚Äîwas rendered by the 6th-century Roman historian Procopius as Gurgenes (). Toumanoff's identification of Vakhtang with Gurgenes has not been universally accepted.Greatrex, Geoffrey (1998), Rome and Persia at war, 502‚Äì532, p. 129. Francis Cairns, Early reign The largest expansion of Iberia under Vakhtang I Beyond the Life of Vakhtang Gorgasali (hereinafter LVG), the medieval Georgian sources mention Vakhtang only briefly, yet with respect rarely afforded to the pre-Bagratid Georgian monarchs. Notwithstanding its semi-legendary epic character, the LVG provides many important details, which can be combined with the sources closer to the period in question, such as Lazarus of Parpi and Procopius. Vakhtang is reported by the LVG to have succeeded at the age of 7 his father King Mihrdat (V). His mother, a Christianized Persian Sagdukht, assumed regency in Vakhtang's minority. The author then describes the grave situation in which Iberia was at that time, troubled by the Sassanids' Zoroastrianizing efforts and a ravaging raid by the \\"Ossetians\\" from the north, this letter being a possible reference to the invasion by the Huns (which may have included Alans) through the Caspian Gates mentioned by Priscus. At the age of 16, Vakhtang is said to have led a victorious retaliatory war against the \\"Ossetians\\", winning a single combat against the enemy's giant and relieving his sister Mirandukht from captivity. At the age 19, Vakhtang married Balendukht, \\"daughter\\" of the Great King Hormizd (apparently Hormizd III, r. 457‚Äì459). Soon, upon the Great King's request, Vakhtang took part in the campaign in \\"India\\", probably in Peroz's abortive expedition against the Hephthalites in the 460s, and against the Roman Empire in 472, in which Vakhtang is reported to have gained control of Egrisi (Lazica) and Abkhazia.Thomson, Robert W.

Church affairs Returning to Iberia, Vakhtang took up a series of measures aimed at strengthening the royal authority. Resenting Iranian encroachments on his independence, Vakhtang reversed his political orientation and effected a rapprochement with the Roman government. He married Helena, \\"daughter\\" (possibly relative) of Emperor Zeno, and received permission from Constantinople to elevate the head of the church of Iberia, the bishop of Mtskheta, to the rank of catholicos, which he sent, together with newly appointed 12 bishops, to be consecrated at Antioch. These rearrangements did not pass smoothly and the king had to overcome opposition, especially in the person of Mikel, the deposed bishop of Mtskheta. Javakhishvili explains this conflict on account of doctrinal differences between the Monophysite Vakhtang and Diophysite Mikel, a presumption supported by Toumanoff, who points out, that the change of prelate and his subordination to Antioch could \\"only imply acceptance of Zeno's formulary of faith\\", i.e., the moderately Monophysite Henotikon of 482. On his part, another Georgian historian, Simon Janashia, argues that Vakhtang was inclined towards Diophysitism while Mikel adhered to Monophysitism.Suny, Ronald Grigor (1994), The Making of the Georgian Nation, pp. 23‚Äì25. Indiana University Press, War with Iran Ruins of Ujarma, once an Iberian stronghold under Vakhtang By espousing pro-Roman policy, Vakhtang further alienated his nobles, who sought Iranian support against the king's encroachments on their autonomy. In 482, Vakhtang put to death his most influential vassal, Varsken, vitaxa of Gogarene, a convert to Zoroastrianism and a champion of Iran's influence in the Caucasus, who had executed his Christian wife, Shushanik, daughter of the Armenian Mamikonid prince Vardan II and a hero of the earliest surviving piece of Georgian literature. By this act, Vakhtang placed himself in open confrontation with his Iranian suzerain. Vakhtang called on the Armenian princes and the Huns for co-operation. After some hesitation, the Armenians under Vardan's nephew Vahan Mamikonian, joined forces with Vakhtang. The allies were routed and Iberia was ravaged by Iranian punitive expeditions in 483 and 484, forcing Vakhtang into flight to Roman- controlled Lazica (modern western Georgia). After Peroz's death in the war with the Hephthalites in 484, his successor Balash reestablished peace in the Caucasus. Vakhtang was able to resume his reign in Iberia, but did not betray his pro-Roman line. Once the Hundred Years Peace between Iran and Rome collapsed, Kavadh I of the Sassanids summoned Vakhtang as a vassal to join in a new campaign against Rome. Vakhtang refused, provoking an Iranian invasion of his kingdom. Then about 60, he had to spend the last years of his life in war and exile, fruitlessly appealing for the Roman aid. The chronology of this period is confused, but by 518 an Iranian viceroy had been installed at the Iberian town of Tiflis, founded‚Äîaccording to Georgian tradition‚Äîby Vakhtang and designated as the country's future capital. According to the LVG, Vakhtang died fighting an Iranian invading army at the hands of his renegade slave who shot him through an armpit defect of his armor. The wounded king was transported to his castle at Ujarma where he died and was interred at the cathedral in Mtskheta. Javakhishvili puts Vakhtang's death at c. 502. If Toumanoff's identification of Procopius‚Äô Gurgenes with Vakhtang is true, the king might have ended his reign in 522 by taking refuge in Lazica, where he possibly died around the same time. Gurgenes‚Äô family members‚ÄîPeranius, Pacurius, and Phazas‚Äîhad careers in the Roman military.Procopius reports that the Iberian king Gurgenes defected to the Romans at some point during Justin I's reign, but was defeated by Iranians and forced into flight to the Roman territory (Bell. pern. 1.12.) Family According to the LVG, Vakhtang was survived by three sons. Dachi, Vakhtang's eldest son by his first marriage to the Iranian princess Balendukht (who died at childbirth), succeeded him as king of Iberia and had to return to Iranian allegiance. Two younger sons by Vakhtang's second marriage to the Roman lady Elene‚ÄîLeon and Mihrdat‚Äîwere enfeoffed of the southwestern Iberian provinces of Klarjeti and Javakheti in which Leon's progeny‚Äîthe Guaramids‚Äîtraditionally followed pro-Roman orientation. Both these lines survived in Iberia into the 8th century, being succeeded by their energetic cousins of the Bagratid family. Toumanoff has inferred that the Samanazus, a name of the Iberian \\"king\\" found in John Malala's list of rulers contemporary with Justinian and reported by Theophanes the Confessor and Georgios Kedrenos to have visited Constantinople in 535, might have been a corruption of words meaning \\"brother of Dachi\\" and so perhaps refers to Mihrdat.Martindale, John Robert (1992), The Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire, p. 1109.

A royal oriflamme of the Georgian Bagratids was known as \\"Gorgasliani\\", i.e., \\"of Gorgasali\\". It is sometimes supposed to be the earliest model of the current Georgian national flag. In popular memory, his image has acquired a legendary and romantic fa√ßade. Vakhtang is a subject of several folk poems and legends, extolling the king's perceived greatness, enormous physical strength, courage and devoutness to Christianity. Tsulaia, G. V.

A legend has it that when King Vakhtang was in the forest, his falcon chased a pheasant. The bird fell into a hot water spring and the king and his servants saw the steam come out of the water. Surprised by the abundance of hot water, Vakhtang gave orders to build a city on this site and named it \\"Tbilisi\\", that is, \\"the site of warm springs\\".Constantine B. Lerner, \\"The 'River of Paradaise' and the Legend about the City of Tbilisi: A Literary Source of the Legend,\\" Folklore 16 (November 2001): 72‚Äì77 Vakhtang was officially included in the Georgian Orthodox calendar‚Äîand a church built in his honor in the city of Rustavi‚Äîearly in the 1990s, but he had presumably been considered a saint long before that.

Vidal was born in Caracas, Venezuela in 1964. At age 20, he became the first Venezuelan swimmer to win an Olympic medal in the 200-meter butterfly competition at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California. Although he was one of the smallest men in the pool at 5-foot-11, Vidal was well ahead of West Germany's 6-foot-7 Michael Gross at the finish. However, one of Gross' elongated arms managed to touch the poolside first, robbing Vidal of silver. That heroic bronze-medal finish made him a national celebrity, with his image splashed on magazine and newspaper covers throughout Venezuela. His mark ranks him as the eighth of the top ten swimmers in the 200-meter butterfly of all time. A year later, Vidal left Venezuela to pursue a career in administration and earned his bachelor's degree in computer and information sciences from the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he swam for the Florida Gators swimming and diving team in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) competition under coach Randy Reese from 1981 to 1985. Vidal was a member of the Gators' NCAA national championship teams in 1983 and 1984, and received six All-American honors. After returning to Venezuela, Vidal was employed by a local television channel as a sports commentator and became a well-known television personality.

Since she died defending her right to profess Christianity, she is regarded as a martyr.

Varsken was a defiant vassal of Vakhtang I Gorgasali, King of Kartli (Iberia), and took a pro- Persian position, renouncing Christianity and adopting Zoroastrianism. He killed his spouse after she refused to submit to his order to abandon her Christian faith. Varsken himself was put to death by King Vakhtang in 483.

Douhua () is the short form of doufuhua (). It is a Chinese snack made with very soft tofu. It is also referred to as tofu pudding, soybean pudding, or tofu brains.  History  Tofu or doufu () is thought to have originated in ancient China during the Western Han Dynasty. Chinese people have developed and enriched the recipes for tofu dishes on the basis of their own tastes, such as mapo tofu, stinky tofu, pickled tofu, steamed tofu and uncongealed tofu pudding, etc.  Traditions = Northern Chinese cuisine  In northern China, douhua is often eaten with soy sauce, thus resulting in a savory flavor. Northern Chinese often refer to douhua as doufunao (, often shortened to ). Local Beijing people usually eat doufunao for breakfast together with eggs or youtiao (fried dough sticks). Doufunao can be found at breakfast stands along the streets in the morning. Other times it is hard to find outside of a restaurant.  Sichuan cuisine  Douhua in Sichuan is often made without any sugar at all, then served by carrying pole or bicycle vendors with a number of condiments such as chili oil, soy sauce, Sichuan pepper, scallions, and nuts, and is sometimes eaten along with white rice as well.  Hubei cuisine  Douhua is served with sugar in Hubei. It is referred to as either doufunao (Simplified ) or doufuhua ().  Cantonese cuisine  In Cantonese cuisine, tau fu fa () is served with sweet ginger or clear syrup, and sometimes as a mixture with black sesame paste, and sometimes also with coconut milk. Traditionally it is made in a wooden bucket, and sold as wooden bucket tofu pudding () as part of dim sum cuisine. Taiwanese cuisine Douhua in ginger syrup from Taiwan In Taiwanese cuisine, douhua is served with sweet toppings like cooked peanuts, adzuki beans, cooked barley, tapioca, mung beans, and a syrup flavored with ginger or almond. During the summer, douhua is served with crushed ice; in the winter, it is served warm. Southeast Asian cuisineFilipino cuisine= Taho, the Philippine version of douhua, served in a small plastic cup. In the Philippines, fresh silken tofu served in sweet brown syrup is known as taho and sold by hawkers in the mornings, usually door-to-door and in public plazas, or outside churches. In some regional variations, taho is often served with sugarcane syrup or strawberry syrup. =Indonesian cuisine= Tahwa, Indonesian version of douhua, with ginger syrup and peanut In Indonesia, it is known as Kembang tahu or in Java as Tahwa derived from the Chinese Hokkien name Tau Hwe, or Wedang Tahu (Wedang means hot water with ginger, Tahu means tofu) and is usually sold by hawkers. It is served warm or cold with palm sugar syrup that has been flavored with pandan leaves and ginger. =Malaysian and Singaporean cuisine= Douhua in sugar syrup sold in West Coast, Singapore In Malaysia and Singapore, it is more commonly known by its names tau hua or tau huay in Hokkien, or by the Cantonese name (tau fu fa), with the Cantonese variation being more common in Malaysia. In Penang, the common term is tau hua, due to Hokkien being its dominant local Chinese language. It is usually served either with a clear sweet syrup alone, with ginkgo seeds suspended in the syrup, or in a sugar syrup infused with pandan. Alternatively, it can also be served with palm-syrup (Gula Melaka). =Thai cuisine= In Thailand, it is known by its Chinese Hokkien name taohuai (‡πÄ‡∏ï‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏Æ‡∏ß‡∏¢). It is usually served cold with milk and fruit salad, which is known as taohuai nom sot (‡πÄ‡∏ï‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏Æ‡∏ß‡∏¢‡∏ô‡∏°‡∏™‡∏î, literally \\"douhua in fresh milk\\") or taohuai fruit salad (‡πÄ‡∏ï‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏Æ‡∏ß‡∏¢‡∏ü‡∏£‡∏∏‡∏ï‡∏™‡∏•‡∏±‡∏î), or served hot with ginger syrup, which is known as taohuai nam khing (‡πÄ‡∏ï‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏Æ‡∏ß‡∏¢‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥‡∏Ç‡∏¥‡∏á). =Vietnamese cuisine= In Vietnam, it is known as t√†u h·ªß n∆∞·ªõc ƒë∆∞·ªùng, t√†u h·ªß hoa or t√†o ph·ªõ, ƒë·∫≠u h·ªß, t√†u h·ªß. It varies in three regions in Vietnam: * Northern region ‚Äî served with jasmine infused sugary water. It is enjoyed as warm in winter and cold with ice in summer. * Central region ‚Äî cooked with spicy ginger. Sugar is added. Douhua pieces are usually unshaped because of their softness. * Southern region ‚Äî served warm with lychee and coconut water. Ginger is optional. Douhua pieces are firmer than those in the North and the Central. Packaged The dessert is also sold in North American Asian supermarkets in plastic containers.

The preceding winter had been one of very heavy snow accumulation. The New Bonner Lab at Rothera Station in November 2003. The Rothera Research Station is a British Antarctic Survey (BAS) base on the Antarctic Peninsula, located at Rothera Point, Adelaide Island. Rothera also serves as the capital of the British Antarctic Territory, a British Overseas Territory. History and current activities Rothera station was established in 1975 to replace Adelaide station (1961-1977) where the skiway had deteriorated. The opening of the Bonner Laboratory in 1996/1997 marked the start of new activities in biological sciences in the Antarctic peninsula. These included scuba diving and experiments conducted in the Bonner Laboratory throughout the year. The first Bonner Lab burned down in the winter of 2001 after an electrical fault; it was rebuilt and opened in December 2003. Meteorological research using satellite data intercepted at the Rothera ground station also continues year round. In January 2017, it was announced that the Rothera Research Station will receive ¬£100m in funding from the government. The money will be used by the British Antarctic Survey to build new living quarters, storage and a new wharf. Tim Stockings, its director of operations called the investment ‚Äúan exciting moment for polar science‚Äù. A portion of the money will also be used to fund the modernisation of facilities and buildings at the British Antarctic stations in Signy, Bird Island and at King Edward Point. Fieldwork is concentrated in the summer months from November until March. Once in the field, the parties travel using snowmobiles and sledges for up to four months, and, being in daily HF radio communication with Rothera, they can be resupplied when necessary by air. The station is open throughout the year with a maximum population of 130 in the summer and an average winter population of 22. Rocket science In 1998, 26 sounding rockets of \\"Viper\\"-type were launched from Rothera Research Station. They reached altitudes of 100 kilometres (over 60 mi). Buildings at Rothera Rothera has evolved from a small base (in its first winter it housed only four people) to the large complex it is today. As is the case everywhere in Antarctica, the buildings need constant repair, and eventual renewal, as the harsh environment takes its toll. Although some of the buildings are very new, some of the older ones still survive, often having undergone many different uses. New Bransfield House This two story building houses the communal dining area, bar, library, film/TV rooms, computer facilities, phone booth, some offices and the post office/ station shop. It was opened in 2008. Old Bransfield House This was re-built from the original in 1985/1986, using parts of the old building. The building was the hub of the base, it has the bulk of the non-science offices, computer rooms, communication facilities, meteorological facilities, dried food storage and kitchen. The building was named after the former BAS ship '. There is a link corridor to the garage, and on one end is the operations tower, used during flight operations. Bransfield also produces all the fresh water for the base using a reverse osmosis plant. This was installed to replace old melt tanks, which were used to melt snow. Admirals House Admirals House was built over two seasons (1999/2000 and 2000/2001). It is a prefabricated unit from Top Housing AB of Sweden. The building has 44 two-person rooms, each with a shower and toilet facility. The building has washing facilities and heated boot rooms. It is named after a dog team that operated out of Rothera. Bonner Lab Bonner Lab and Boat Shed at Rothera. Basler DC-3 landing The Bonner Lab has been built twice, the first time in 1996/1997. A fire in winter 2001, caused by an electrical fault, destroyed the building, though nobody was hurt. The lab was then rebuilt in the 2002/2003 seasons and opened in the 2003/2004 season. The Bonner Lab is a state-of-the- art facility for terrestrial and marine biology. The dive facility (with decompression chamber, warming bath, and compressors) keeps diving safely going throughout the year. There are three dry labs, one wet lab, aquarium, library, microscope room and a small kitchen. During the winter this large facility is left in the hands of the dive officer, a terrestrial biologist and two marine biologists, although this can vary depending on the projects underway at the time. In the summer, as many as 30 science staff can occupy the building, and upwards of 10 divers can be using the facility. The lab was named after W. Nigel Bonner, head of biological science at BAS between 1953 and 1986, and deputy director of BAS from 1986 to 1988. The original lab was built in response to the base at Signy being down scaled to a summer only facility. Fuchs House Also known as the Sledge Store, or Phase III. The building was erected in 1978/79, and originally housed the science offices, cold room and travel store. It is now used mainly as the travel store or sledge store. The huge amount of mountaineering or camping equipment for use in Antarctica is maintained and stored here. The cold store remains, with four large freezers storing all the base's frozen food. It was named after Sir Vivian Fuchs, BAS Director from 1958 to 1973. Giants House Erected in 1996/1997 as transit accommodation, it contains eight rooms of four beds, and a toilet / shower facility. The building is only used in summer. Generator Shed, Chippy Shop, and Bingham Bingham House was originally at Adelaide Island Base, and is as such the oldest building on site. It was pulled across from Base T in the winter of 1977. It was used as accommodation, but is now used as a building store. Bingham was named after E W Bingham, leader of FIDS 1945 to 1947 and FIDS surgeon commander. Next door is the Chippy Shop, which was the original Rothera Base, being built in the 1976/1977 season. This building housed the base kitchen and eating facilities until the original Bransfield was built some four years later. As suggested by its name it is now the carpentry workshop, and also houses the electricians' store and workshop. The generator shed houses four Volvo Penta generators and has its own stores and workshop facilities. The Span and Boat Shed The Span and Boat Shed were built at approximately the same time using similar techniques (interlocking steel archways on a concrete base), and are located at either end of site. The Span is a storage facility for vehicles, equipment and waste. It is called the Span as it was manufactured by the Miracle-Span company which specialises in these buildings. The Boat Shed is used to store, maintain and operate the boats for travel to the local islands and diving (all Ribs of various size). It is situated next to the Biscoe Wharf (named after the RRS John Biscoe). There is a slip (only usable in summer) and a hydraulic crane to lift the boats in and out of the water. Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) and Hangar The STP was built in summer 2002/2003. The sewage is treated using bacteria, which leave a peat like substance that is dry and compact enough to remove from Antarctica. The Hangar was built at the same time as the runway and is big enough for three Twin Otters and the Dash 7. Refuges and other buildings There is a refuge hut on Lagoon. This was built out of the materials left over from the original Bransfield House at Rothera. The hut has a stove, fuel, food and four bunks. There is also spare dry clothing, bedding and a pyramid tent. Boat teams who get caught out by bad weather or sea ice can use the refuge. It is often used during the summer months as a place for BAS staff to go and relax. There is an Apple hut on the Leonie Island, which was provided by the Dutch Antarctic Division during a joint working programme. There was also a Melon Hut on Lagoon for the same purpose, but this has now been moved to Anchorage Island. Cultural events Nunatak was the BAS‚Äôs house band. The five person indie rock band is part of a science team investigating climate change and evolutionary biology on the Antarctic Peninsula. They are chiefly known for their participation in Live Earth in 2007, where they were the only band to play in the event's Antarctica concert. Climate Being located just South of the Antarctic Circle, the weather is cold year round. Temperatures in summer barely go over freezing. Rothera Air Facility The station has a 900 m (2,950 ft) crushed rock runway, with an associated hangar and bulk fuel storage facility, and a wharf for the discharge of cargo from supply ships. There is a transitory summer population of scientists and support staff who reach Rothera either by ship or through use of a de Havilland Canada Dash 7 aircraft flying from the Falkland Islands. From its inception until the 1991/1992 summer season BAS Twin Otter aircraft used the skiway 300 m (about 1000 ft) above the station on Wormald Ice Piedmont. With the commissioning of the gravel runway and hangar in 1991/1992 air operations became more reliable and access to Rothera was greatly improved through a direct airlink from the Falkland Islands. The Twin Otters mainly fly south of Rothera, via a network of fuel depots, most of which are manned. Heading south of Rothera, the first stop would be Fossil Bluff, then Sky Blu. The Dash 7 will make approximately 20 flights a season to Stanley during the summer, bringing in scientists, support staff, food and equipment. When not tasked for these flights, the Dash can fly to Sky Blu in one hop, landing on the Blue Ice runway, significantly enhancing the range of the Twin Otters by depositing fuel and equipment in much larger quantities.

The term \\"radio station\\" may include anything capable of transmitting a radio signal. A single ship, aircraft, spacecraft, or group of them may also maintain radio silence.Iraqi ships maintaining radio silence The Guardian  Amateur radio Wilderness Protocol  The Wilderness Protocol recommends that those stations able to do so should monitor the primary (and secondary, if possible) frequency every three hours starting at 7 AM, local time, for 5 minutes starting at the top of every hour, or even continuously. The Wilderness Protocol is now included in both the ARRL ARES Field Resources Manual and the ARES Emergency Resources Manual. Per the manual, the protocol is: > The Wilderness protocol (see page 101, August 1995 QST) calls for hams in > the wilderness to announce their presence on, and to monitor, the national > calling frequencies for five minutes beginning at the top of the hour, every > three hours from 7 AM to 7 PM while in the back country.

National calling > frequencies: 52.525, 146.52, 223.50, 446.00, 1294.50 MHz. Priority transmissions should begin with the LITZ (Long Interval Tone Zero or Long Time Zero) DTMF signal for at least 5 seconds. CQ like calls (to see who is out there) should not take place until after 4 minutes after the hour.  Maritime mobile service  Radio room clock, showing the 500 kHz silence periods (red wedges), the 2182 kHz silence periods (green wedges), and alternating red and white bars around the circumference to aid manual transmission of the 4-second SOLAS signal.  Distress calls  Radio silence can be used in nautical and aeronautical communications to allow faint distress calls to be heard (see Mayday). In the latter case, the controlling station can order other stations to stop transmitting with the proword \\"Seelonce Seelonce Seelonce\\". (The word uses an approximation of the French pronunciation of the word silence, \\"See-LAWNCE.\\"). Once the need for radio silence is finished, the controlling station lifts radio silence by the prowords \\"Seelonce FINI.\\"U.S. Coast Guard, Radiotelephone Handbook, COMDTINST M2300.7 Disobeying a Seelonce Mayday order constitutes a serious criminal offence in most countries. The aviation equivalent of Seelonce Mayday is the phrase or command \\"Stop Transmitting - Distress (or Mayday)\\". \\"Distress traffic ended\\" is the phrase used when the emergency is over. Again, disobeying such an order is extremely dangerous and is therefore a criminal offence in most countries.  Silent periods  Up until the procedure was replaced by the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (August 1, 2013 in the U.S.), maritime radio stations were required to observe radio silence on 500 kHz (radiotelegraph) for the three minutes between 15 and 18 minutes past the top of each hour, and for the three minutes between 45 and 48 minutes past the top of the hour; and were also required to observe radio silence on 2182 kHz (upper-sideband radiotelephony) for the first three minutes of each hour (H+00 to H+03) and for the three minutes following the bottom of the hour (H+30 to H+33). For 2182 kHz, this is still a legal requirement, according to 47 CFR 80.304 - Watch requirement during silence periods.  Military  An order for Radio silence is generally issued by the military where any radio transmission may reveal troop positions, either audibly from the sound of talking, or by radio direction finding. In extreme scenarios Electronic Silence ('Emissions Control' or EMCON) may also be put into place as a defence against interception.Emissions Control 3 Mission Airforce Technology In the British Army, the imposition and lifting of radio silence will be given in orders or ordered by control using 'Battle Code' (BATCO). Control is the only authority to impose or lift radio silence either fully or selectively. The lifting of radio silence can only be ordered on the authority of the HQ that imposed it in the first place. During periods of radio silence a station may, with justifiable cause, transmit a message. This is known as Breaking Radio Silence. The necessary replies are permitted but radio silence is automatically re-imposed afterwards. The breaking station transmits its message using BATCO to break radio silence. The command for imposing radio silence is: > Hello all stations, this is 0. Impose radio silence. Over. Other countermeasures are also applied to protect secrets against enemy signals intelligence. Electronic emissions can be used to plot a line of bearing to an intercepted signal, and if more than one receiver detects it, triangulation can estimate its location. Radio Detection Finding (RDF) was critically important during the Battle of Britain and reached a high state of maturity in early 1943 with the aid of United States institutions aiding British Research and Development under the pressures of the continuing Battle of the Atlantic during World War II when locating U-boats. One key breakthrough was marrying MIT/Raytheon developed CRT technology with pairs of RDF antennas giving a differentially derived instant bearing useful in tactical situations, enabling escorts to run down the bearing to an intercept. The U-boat command of Wolfpacks required a minimum once daily communications check-in, allowing new Hunter-Killer groups to localize U-boats tactically from April on, leading to dramatic swings in the fortunes of war in the battles between March, when the U-boats sank over 300 allied ships and \\"Black May\\" when the allies sank at least 44 U-boats--each without orders to exercise EMCON/radio silence.  Other uses  Radio silence can be maintained for other purposes, such as for highly sensitive radio astronomy. Radio silence can also occur for spacecraft whose antenna is temporarily pointed away from Earth in order to perform observations, or there is insufficient power to operate the radio transmitter, or during re-entry when the hot plasma surrounding the spacecraft blocks radio signals. In the USA, CONELRAD and EBS (which are now discontinued), and EAS (which is currently active) are also ways of maintaining radio silence, mainly in broadcasting, in the event of an attack.  Examples of radio silence orders  *Radio silencing helped hide the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in World War II.Pearl Harbor National Geographic The attackers had used AM radio station KGU in Honolulu as a homing signal. *On June 2, 1942, during World War II, a nine-minute air-raid alert, including at 9:22 pm a radio silence order applied to all radio stations from Mexico to Canada.

In addition to the thick-billed murre, notable bird species include black guillemot and peregrine falcon. Polar bear, seal, and walrus are common in the area. History At the southern end of the island there are remains of a Dorset settlement. The island is known for its widespread cannibalism which ended around 1900 as the inhabitants moved to the mainland. Skulls and human remains have been reported on the island, but the accuracy of these reports can be called into question as there is an abundance of mystery and legend surrounding the details of the island. In July 1971 an exploratory oil well was drilled on the island, yet all that remains are a few dilapidated shelters and rusted equipment.

Because of its lacy appearance, it is considered among the most attractive of the horsetails.  Botanical description  This perennial horsetail has erect, hollow stems that grow from 30 to 60 cm in length and from 1‚Äì4 mm thick. The branches themselves are compound and delicate, occurring in whorls and drooping downward. There are generally 12 or more branches per whorl. Fertile stems are at first tan-to-brown and unbranched, but later become like the sterile stems, which are more highly branched and green. All the stems have 10-18 spiny vertical ridges that contain silica spicules. The leaves are scales fused into sheaths that cover the stems and branches. These spiny leaves are larger and looser on the fertile stems. The fertile stems are shorter than the others; on these develop the cones that bear the spore casings. The leaves develop on the fertile stems and the stems lengthen; then the cones open to release their spores. The cones then drop off. This process takes a few weeks. All the stems may continue to grow until fall and generally die back over winter.  Reproduction  This plant reproduces by spores, but its primary means of reproduction is done vegetatively by rhizomes. These rhizome systems are deep and extensive, as well as extremely long-lived. These creeping rhizomes occasionally produce tubers, and often outweigh the above- ground growth by 100 to 1.  Habitat  These horsetails are commonly found in wet or swampy forest, open woodlands, and meadow areas. The species name sylvaticum is Latin for \\"of the forests\\", emphasizing that the wood horsetail is most commonly found in forested habitats. The plant is an indicator of boreal and cool-temperate climates, and very moist to wet, nitrogen-poor soils.

Due to the limited ability of certain coliform bacteria to ferment lactose, the definition has changed to bacteria containing the enzyme Œ≤-galactosidase. They are a commonly used indicator of sanitary quality of foods and water. Coliforms can be found in the aquatic environment, in soil and on vegetation; they are universally present in large numbers in the feces of warm-blooded animals. While coliforms themselves are not normally causes of serious illness, they are easy to culture, and their presence is used to indicate that other pathogenic organisms of fecal origin may be present. Such pathogens include disease-causing bacteria, viruses, or protozoa and many multicellular parasites. Coliform procedures are performed in aerobic or anaerobic conditions. Typical genera include:The Microbiology of Drinking Water (2002) ‚Äì Part 1 -(h2o) Water Quality and Public Health; Department of the Environment *Citrobacter *Enterobacter *Hafnia *Klebsiella *Escherichia Escherichia coli (E. coli) can be distinguished from most other coliforms by its ability to ferment lactose at 44¬∞C in the fecal coliform test, and by its growth and color reaction on certain types of culture media. When cultured on an eosin methylene blue (EMB) plate, a positive result for E. coli is metallic green colonies on a dark purple medium. Also can be cultured on Tryptone Bile X-Glucuronide (TBX) to appear as blue or green colonies after incubation period of 24 hours. Escherichia coli have an incubation period of 12‚Äì72 hours with the optimal growth temperature being 37¬∞C. Unlike the general coliform group, E. coli are almost exclusively of fecal origin and their presence is thus an effective confirmation of fecal contamination. Most strains of E. coli are harmless, but some can cause serious illness in humans. Infection symptoms and signs include bloody diarrhea, stomach cramps, vomiting and occasionally, fever. The bacteria can also cause pneumonia, other respiratory illnesses and urinary tract infections. An easy way to differentiate between different types of coliform bacteria is by using an eosin methylene blue agar plate. This plate is partially inhibitory to Gram (+) bacteria, and will produce a color change in the Gram (-) bacterial colonies based on lactose fermentation abilities. Strong lactose fermenters will appear as dark blue/purple/black, and E.coli (which also ferments lactose) colonies will be dark colored, but will also appear to have a metallic green sheen. Other coliform bacteria will appear as thick, slimy colonies, with non-fermenters being colorless, and weak fermenters being pink.

It begins at the intersection of Queen Street West, King Street West and the Queensway running north to Dundas Street West. At its southern starting point, King Street West traffic continues northward onto Roncesvalles Avenue unless the traffic turns east or west onto Queen Street West or the Queensway. At its northern end point, traffic continues onto Dundas Street, which is essentially a straight-line northern extension of Roncesvalles. Roncesvalles Avenue takes its name from the Battle of Roncesvalles, which took place in the Roncesvalles Pass in Spain in 1813. (The name 'Roncesvalles' means 'valley of thorns' in Spanish.) At this gorge, Colonel Walter O'Hara--an early 19th-century Irish settler who played a significant role in the establishment of the neighbourhood--led a regiment that fought against the retreating army of Napoleon. Route description Roncesvalles Avenue was a four-lane arterial roadway, although parking is allowed at all times on both sides of the street. Recent construction converted the street to two driving lanes, with the former right lanes re-purposed as permanent parking spaces, right turn lanes or streetcar platforms where necessary. Along the east side of the street from Queen Street to Dundas, the buildings are storefronts with upper apartments. Most of the buildings date from 1910 and later. Along the west side, the land usage is more diverse. At the intersection of Queen Street and Roncesvalles, there is a hotel. Behind the intersection is the large Roncesvalles Carhouse, a TTC streetcar maintenance and storage facility. Further north is the Copernicus Lodge, a retirement home. Residential usage predominates along the west side, with some commercial storefronts around the intersection with Howard Park Avenue. Businesses along Roncesvalles Avenue are organized into the \\"Roncesvalles Village Business Improvement Area\\". The residential neighbourhood, formerly part of the former villages of Brockton and Parkdale, is today simply classified as Roncesvalles. Many of the businesses there serve the city's Polish population. Bumpout on Roncesvalles Avenue serving as both a streetcar loading platform as well as a bicycle lane. The street is normally served by the frequent 504A King streetcar, its rails embedded in the street. Major construction took place between July 2009 and December 2010 to replace water mains which run below the tracks, the tracks themselves and the road and sidewalks. The project transformed the street for virtually its entire length. The width of Roncesvalles increases at its south end, partly to allow turning streetcars access to the TTC yard. As part of the street redesign, a widened sidewalk \\"bumpout\\" was added to each stop to allow riders to board the streetcar directly from the curb. To accommodate a bike lane at a TTC stop, the bike lane would gently rise up from the main road to run on top of the bumpout. When the streetcar is boarding, cyclists are required to stop and allow riders on and off. Since January 2018, the TTC has operated its new fleet of low-floor accessible Flexity Outlook streetcars along Roncesvalles Avenue as part of the 504 King route, the route was declared fully accessible as of January 2019, using only the new vehicles, however at this time due to platform height issues, the Flexity loading ramp cannot be deployed along Roncesvalles Avenue. History The first mention of Roncesvalles Avenue in atlases of Toronto was in 1860. The roadway was built to connect Queen Street with Dundas Street, then the main highway west. King Street West was extended to the foot of Roncesvalles in the 1880s. The Queensway was built in the 1950s, although a small part of Queen Street west of Roncesvalles had already been built in the 1800s. The area around the street at the time of its construction was primarily agricultural with market gardens.

They have sometimes been referred to as the North Caucasian Huns and are often assumed to be related to the Huns who later entered Eastern Europe. However, the ethnolinguistic and geographical origins of the Khuni are unclear. The first contemporaneous reference to the Khuni may be by Dionysius Periegetes and Claudius Ptolemy's Geography, in the 2nd century CE, when they are said to be living near the Caspian Sea. Agathangelos claims that there were Huns living among the peoples of the Caucasus in 227 and that they were related to the Iranian Huns. In 535 or 537, an Armenian missionary team headed by the bishop Kardost baptized many of the North Caucasian Huns.Peter Benjamin Golden, An introduction to the history of Turkic peoples, pp. 107 The Syriac source reporting this event also indicates that a writing system for Hunnic was developed.Sirijskie istocniki, pp. 166‚Äì167; Artamonov, 1st. xazar, pp. 92‚Äì94 Huns are said to have established a polity in Daghestan in the 6th century CE. This may have incorporated numerous indigenous Caucasian peoples. In 682 Bishop Israel of Caucasian Albania led an unsuccessful delegation to convert Alp Iluetuer, the ruler of the Caucasian Huns, to Christianity. It has been suggested that Iluetuer is a corruption of the Khazar title elteber (\\"client-ruler) and that this people was subordinate to Khazar rulers from the mid to late 7th century. They are frequently described as being allied with the Khazars in their various wars of the period, particularly against the Caliphate. Little is known about their fate after the early 8th century. It is likely that they became incorporated into the Khazar Khaganate. However, it is likely that they survived in some form or another for several centuries, possibly even until the 11th century.

The Lower Savage Islands lie between Resolution Island and Baffin Island, while Graves Strait separates Resolution Island from the more northern Edgell Island. History English explorer Martin Frobisher landed on the island on July 28, 1576, while on a voyage to discover the fabled Northwest Passage. However it appears to have been named Resolution in 1612 by Sir Thomas Button, after his own ship, the Resolution.The Voyages of Captain Luke Foxe of Hull and Captain Thomas James of Bristol in search of a North-west passage in 1631-32, edited by Miller Christy, Hakluyt society, London, 1894, p.165 fn.1 The island was home to an American military base, now CFS Resolution Island, that became operational in 1954 as part of the Distant Early Warning (DEW) line. The base was vacated in 1973 and turned over to the Canadian government in 1974. The Canadian cargo ship named \\"MINNA\\" was wrecked on the east side of the island, on 18 August 1974. The vessel was then under charter by the Bedford Institute of Oceanography and was doing scientific surveys at the time of the accident. Badly damaged, the crew and scientific equipment's were removed. Bad weather swept the vessel in deeper waters where she sank on October 2, 1974. This vessel with a length of 275 feet's and displacement of 4280 tons was based in Halifax and was on regular charter with the BIO for hydrographic surveys on the Labrador Coast and Hudson Strait. The MINNA was built in 1962 and had a crew of 21 men + 18 scientists. It was during site investigations between 1987 and 1990 that contamination at the site was first discovered. The contamination originates largely from spills from the radar equipment, which used polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) as insulators. Other pollutants include unused transformer fluids, hydrocarbons, asbestos and heavy metals in the buildings and sprinkled throughout the site. Resolution Island has been identified as having the highest level of PCB contamination of all former military sites that fall under Indian and Northern Affairs Canada‚Äôs (INAC) responsibility in the North. In 1993 and 1994, an environmental site assessment of the area was completed. As a result, temporary barriers were placed across drainage paths to stop the migration of PCBs into the water. Further investigations were done and, in 1997, INAC initiated remediation work with Qikiqtaaluk Corporation (QC). A large-scale remediation plan was developed, in cooperation with Environment Canada, QC and Queen's University. Steps were taken at that time to ensure that the contaminants were not posing a risk to humans and wildlife.

Primarily active in Hamburg and Berlin, they were composed of 14 to 21-year-old Germans, mostly middle or upper-class students, but also including some in the Working class. They admired the American way of life, defining themselves in swing music and opposing the National-Socialist ideology, especially the Hitler Youth ().  Name  The name ' was a parody of the numerous youth groups that were organised by the Nazis, such as the '. The youth also referred to themselves as Swings or ' (\\"Swingity\\"); members were called \\"Swing-Boy\\", \\"Swing-Girl\\" or \\"Old-Hot-Boy\\". Counter-culture During the Nazi regime, all the youth (those aged 10 to 17) in Germany who were considered to be Aryan were encouraged to join the Hitler Youth and the League of German Maidens. The leaders of these organisations realized they had to offer some attraction in the area of social dancing to recruit members. Instead of adopting the popular swing dance (because it was viewed as degenerate and tied to the \\"damnable jazz\\"), they resorted to the new German community dances. This proved to be unsuccessful, and instead of embracing the Hitler Youth pastimes, city girls and boys crowded the swing dance joints. This seemed to be the case particularly in the town of Hamburg, where the swing scene was huge. These teenage hoppers were known as ', a name the authorities called them. The Swing Youth disparagingly called the Hitler Youth the \\"Homo Youth\\" while the League of German Maidens was called the \\"League of Soldiers' Mattresses\\".Willett, Ralph; \\"Hot Swing and the Dissolute Life: Youth, Style and Popular Music in Europe 1939-49\\", pp. 157‚Äì163, Popular Music, Volume 8, No. 2, May 1989, p. 158. The Swing Youth used their love of swing and jazz music to create their sub-culture with one former Swing Kid Frederich Ritzel saying in a 1985 interview: \\"Everything for us was a world of great longing, Western life, democracy ‚Äì everything was connected ‚Äì and connected through jazz\\".Willett, Ralph; \\"Hot Swing and the Dissolute Life: Youth, Style and Popular Music in Europe 1939‚Äì49\\", pp. 157‚Äì163, Popular Music, Volume 8, No. 2, May 1989 p. 160. The Swing Kids danced in private quarters, clubs, and rented halls. These adolescents dressed a little differently from the others who were opposed to swing. For example, boys added a little British flair to their clothes by wearing homburg hats, growing their hair long, and attaching a Union Jack pin to their jacket. Additionally, as a reflection of their Anglophilia, the \\"Swing boys\\" liked to carry around umbrellas whatever the weather and to smoke pipes. Girls wore short skirts, applied lipstick and fingernail polish, and wore their hair long and down instead of applying braids or German-style rolls. The fondness of the \\"Swing girls\\" to wear their hair curled and to apply much make-up was a rejection of the Nazi regime's fashion tastes as in the Third Reich, the \\"natural look\\" with no make-up and braided hair was the preferred style for women as it was felt to be more \\"Germanic\\". A police report from 1940 described the Swing Youth as follows: The predominant form of dress consisted of long, often checked English sports jackets, shoes with thick light crepe soles, showly scarves, Anthony Eden hats, an umbrella on the arm whatever the weather, and, as an insignia, a dress-shirt button worn in the buttonhole, with a jewelled stone. The girls too favoured a long overflowing hair style. Their eyebrows were penciled, they wore lipstick and their nails were lacquered. The bearing and behaviour of the members of the clique resembled their dress.Peukert, Detlev Inside Nazi Germany, London: B. T. Batsford, 1987 p. 168. One of their German idols was Johannes Heesters, an actor specialised in operettas. The Swingboys admired his pale face and combed long black hair and tried to copy his attire.¬ªNeger, Neger, Schornsteinfeger!¬´: Meine Kindheit in Deutschland, p. 155, Hans J. Massaquoi, S. Fischer Verlag, . This group consisted mostly of teens and young adults from the upper-class homes of Hamburg. Their objectives were originally more self-indulgent in nature, being privileged with wealth and German heritage, they spent their money on expensive clothing and liquor. The British musicologist Ralph Willett wrote that the Swing Youth wanted to emulate \\"the cool, languid demeanour\\" of British and American film stars.Willett, Ralph; \\"Hot Swing and the Dissolute Life: Youth, Style and Popular Music in Europe 1939-49\\", pp. 157‚Äì163, Popular Music, Volume 8, No. 2, May 1989, p. 159. When the restrictions on jazz became law, their pastime would become a political statement, setting them in clear opposition to the Nazi Party.Kater, M. H. (2004). Hitler Youth. Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press. German musicologist Guido Fackler described the Swingjugend embrace of American music and the \\"English style\\" in clothing as reflecting the fact that: > The Swingjugend rejected the Nazi state, above all because of its ideology > and uniformity, its militarism, the 'F√ºhrer principle' and the leveling > Volksgemeinschaft (people's community). They experienced a massive > restriction of their personal freedom. They rebelled against all this with > jazz and swing, which stood for a love of life, self-determination, non- > conformism, freedom, independence, liberalism, and internationalism. Reflecting their Anglophila, the Swing Youth preferred to speak to each other in English rather than German as English was felt to be more \\"cool\\", a choice of language that vexed the authorities greatly.Peukert, Detlev Inside Nazi Germany, London: B. T. Batsford, 1987, p. 167. English together with French were languages widely taught in Gymnasium (high schools intended as preparation for university) since the early 20th century in the case of the former and since the 18th century in the case of the latter, so any German teenager who attended a Gymnasium could speak at least some French and English. As the Swing Youth were Anglophiles, they often tried to speak and write in the \\"English style\\". One \\"swing boy\\", in a 1940 letter written in slightly broken English to a friend who was going to Hamburg, stated: \\"Be a proper spokesmen for Kiel, won't you? i.e, make sure you're really casual, singing or whistling English hits all the time, absolutely smashed and always surrounded by really amazing women\\". Hamburg, the most Anglophile of German cities, was regarded as the \\"capital\\" of the Swing Youth, and British jazz players like Jack Hylton and Nat Gonella were popular with the Swing Youth, through Willet wrote that they \\"... were sufficiently sophisticated to appreciate the superiority of the American artists as well as the stylish and sensuous qualities of their performances.\\" The Swing Youth were also Americanophiles as many took monikers like Alaska Bill or Texas Jack and their clubs had such names like die Harlem club, die OK Gang club, and die Cotton club. For those designated non-Aryan, it became even more dangerous to be associated with the swing crowd by November 1938, during and after '. The \\"Swing Youth\\" tended to welcome Jewish and ' (\\"half-breed\\") teenagers who wanted to join their gatherings. Affiliation with the jazz culture was damaging whenever other incriminating information could be factored into a formula for persecution. For example, many half-Jews were sought out and persecuted before others if they were known as Swing Kids. For the first five years of the Third Reich, Nazi propaganda had been favourable to Britain as Hitler had hoped for an Anglo-German alliance, but in 1938, when it become clear that Britain was not going to ally with Germany, the propaganda of the regime turned fiercely Anglophobic; a major Britain-bashing campaign was launched in the autumn of 1938. In this light, the Anglophilia of the Swing Youth could be seen as an implicit rejection of the regime. Jazz music was offensive to Nazi ideology, because it was often performed by blacks and a number of Jewish musicians. They called it \\"Negro Music\\" (), \\"degenerate music\\"‚Äîcoined in parallel to \\"degenerate art\\" (). Moreover, song texts defied Nazi ideology, going as far as to promote sexual permissiveness or free love. Despite this, not all jazz was forbidden in Germany at the time. The Swing Kids were initially basically apolitical, similar to their zoot suiter counterparts in North America. A closer parallel to the Swing Youth were the Zazou movement in France at the same time, for the Zazous also enjoyed American music, liked to dress in the \\"English style\\", and had a preference for speaking English over French as the former was felt to be more \\"cool\\". In Austria, the term Schlurf was used for a similar group. A popular term that the swing subculture used to define itself was ', roughly translated as something between \\"laziness\\" and \\"sleaziness\\", indicating contempt for the pressure to do \\"useful work\\" and the repressive sexual mores of the time. Reports by Hitler Youth observers of swing parties and jitterbug went into careful detail about the overtly sexual nature of both. One report describes as \\"moral depravity\\" the fact that swing youth took pleasure in their sexuality. The German historian Detlev Peukert noted how much the police reports on the Swing Youth obsessively concentrated on the subject of the Swing Youth's \\"unabashed pleasure in sexuality\\", through he cautioned that some of the more sensationalist claims about the sexual lives of the Swing Youth in these reports probably said more about the mindset of the people who wrote them rather than what the Swing Youth were actually doing. In particular, Peukert wrote that the lurid claims made by the police that Swing Youth dance sessions were followed up by group sex seems to have had no basis in reality. The Swing Kids were defining a counterculture, shown by their clothing and music. Their behaviour, described by many Nazis as \\"effete\\", ran counter to the spartan militarism that the regime was trying to inculcate in its youth. They organised dance festivals and contests and invited jazz bands. These events were occasions to mock the Nazis, the military and the '‚Äîhence the famous \\"Swing Heil!\\", mocking the infamous \\"Sieg Heil!\\" Swing Kids wore long hair and hats, carried umbrellas and met in caf√©s and clubs. They developed a jargon mostly made of anglicisms.(2011, 04). Subculture Swing Kids. StudyMode.com. Retrieved 04, 2011 The Swing Youth were intense Anglophiles who preferred to listen to \\"English music\\" (i.e. American swing and jazz music) and liked to dress in the \\"English style\\". A secret report from the Reich Ministry of Justice in January 1944 described the Swing Youth as follows:\\"Report on Youth Gangs in the Reich\\" pp. 450‚Äì455 Nazism 1919‚Äì1945 Volume 4 The German Home Front in World War II ed. Jeremy Noakes, Exeter: University of Exeter Press, 1998, pp. 452‚Äì453. Ways of resistance Though they were not an organised political-opposition organisation, the whole culture of the Swing Kids evolved into a non-violent refusal of the civil order and culture of National Socialism. From a paper of the National Youth Leader: > The members of the Swing youth oppose today's Germany and its police, the > Party and its policy, the ', work and military service, and are opposed, or > at least indifferent, to the ongoing war. They see the mechanisms of > National Socialism as a \\"mass obligation\\". The greatest adventure of all > times leaves them indifferent; much to the contrary, they long for > everything that is not German, but English. From 1941, the violent repression by the ' and the ' shaped the political spirit of the swing youth. Also, by police order, people under 21 were forbidden to go to dance bars, which encouraged the movement to seek its survival in clandestine measures. The strict regimentation of youth culture in Nazi Germany through the Hitler Youth led to the emergence of several underground protest movements, through which adolescents were better able to exert their independence. There were street gangs (') of working class youths who borrowed elements from socialist and communist traditions to forge their own identities, and there were less politically motivated groups, such as the Edelweiss Pirates (), who acted in defiance of Hitler Youth norms. A third group, consisting mainly of upper middle class youths, based their protest on their musical preferences, rejecting the ' music propagated by the party for American jazz forms, especially swing.  Connection with the White Rose  Monument to the \\"Wei√üe Rose\\" in front of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich The Swing Kids of Hamburg at some point had contacts with another famous resistance movement, when three members of the White Rose () developed a sympathy for the Swing Kids. No formal co-operation arose, though these contacts were later used by the ' (\\"People's Court\\") to accuse some Swing Kids of anarchist propaganda and sabotage of the armed forces. The consequent trial, death sentences and executions were averted by the ending of the war. Swing clubs When bigger gatherings were banned, the Swing Kids moved to more informal settings, and swing clubs and discotheques emerged in all the major cities of the Reich. Participants were mainly from the upper middle class, as swing culture required the participants to have access to the music, which was not played on German radio, so that extensive collections of phonograph recordings were essential. Similarly, to understand the lyrics of the predominantly American songs, it was necessary to have at least a rudimentary understanding of English, which was not taught in the ' (working- class high school). Relative wealth also fostered a distinctive style among the Swing Kids, which was in some ways comparable to the zoot suit style popular in the United States at the time. Boys usually wore long jackets, often checkered, shoes with crepe soles (for dancing), and flashy scarves. They almost always carried an umbrella, and added a dress shirt button with a semi-precious stone. Girls generally wore their hair long and loose and added excessive makeup. Their dandyish dress style riled the Nazis by drawing heavily on Hispanic pachucos. Clamping down On 18 August 1941, in a brutal police operation, over 300 ' were arrested. The measures against them ranged from cutting their hair and sending them back to school under close monitoring, to the deportation of the leaders to concentration camps. The boys went to the Moringen concentration camp while the girls were sent to Ravensbr√ºck. This mass arrest encouraged the youth to further their political consciousness and opposition to National Socialism. They started to distribute anti-fascist propaganda. Prisoners at Ravensbruck On 2 January 1942, Heinrich Himmler wrote to Reinhard Heydrich calling on him to clamp down on the ringleaders of the swing movement, recommending a few years in a concentration camp with beatings and forced labour: > My judgment is that the whole evil must be radically exterminated now. I > cannot but see that we have taken only half measures. All ringleaders (...) > are into a concentration camp to be re-educated (...) detention in > concentration camp for these youths must be longer, 2‚Äì3 years (...) it is > only through the utmost brutality that we will be able to avert the > dangerous spread of anglophile tendencies, in these times where Germany > fights for its survival. The crackdown soon followed: clubs were raided, and participants were hauled off to camps. In January 1943, G√ºnter Discher, as one of the ringleaders of the Swing Kids, was deported to the youth concentration camp of Moringen. In popular culture The 1993 film Swing Kids examined this underground culture of rebellion during Nazi Germany. Directed by Thomas Carter and starring Robert Sean Leonard, Christian Bale, Frank Whaley, and Kenneth Branagh (uncredited), the picture was not a commercial success but sustains a large underground following and is described by film critic Janet Maslin as having a historical background.

It Takes a Thief was inspired by, though not based upon, the 1955 motion picture To Catch a Thief, directed by Alfred Hitchcock; both of their titles stem from the English proverb \\"Set a thief to catch a thief\\" (or as it is more often phrased, \\"It takes a thief to catch a thief\\").

When the series was released in syndication in the 1970s, the pilot episode was withheld from the package and was expanded into a 99-minute feature film for overseas release; this was eventually released in a separate domestic syndication package, under the title Magnificent Thief. The pilot feature film version was released on home video in the 1990s. In the series' third season, Throne was replaced by Edward Binns as Mundy's SIA boss, Wallie Powers. As Throne explained: \\"They had this idea of shooting the whole season in Italy, but they wanted me to stay behind and give Wagner‚Äôs character...orders over the phone. I told them if I didn't go I'd quit, and I did. The show didn't last another half a season.\\" Throne's version of events was incorrect, as the third season was not shortened. In the end, portions of season three were filmed in Europe and Binns, Throne's replacement, filmed some scenes there. Also during the third season, Fred Astaire played Alistair Mundy, Alexander's father, in five episodes. Alistair is also a master gentleman-thief, who says bemusedly, at the start of each episode in which he appears, \\"I've heard of stealing from the government, but for the government?\\" Alistair was the lead character in most episodes in which he appeared, rather than Wagner's character of Alexander, who was relegated to supporting or even cameo roles in these episodes. This is somewhat reminiscent of the way the 1950s TV series Maverick would introduce a relative of the previously established main character, and then alternate the two characters the leading series role from week to week. Susan Saint James appeared in five episodes. Charlene Holt appeared in three episodes. Other guest stars included prominent veteran Hollywood movie stars such as Bette Davis, Joseph Cotten, Hermione Gingold, Paul Henreid, Fernando Lamas, and Ida Lupino.

The 18-disc set features all 66 episodes of the series, several bonus features, an interview with Robert Wagner, and a special feature-length cut of the pilot episode. The DVD set was promoted in commercials broadcast on Antenna TV, which featured Wagner publicizing the DVD set. Entertainment One would later release the complete first season as a standalone DVD set on October 2, 2012; this set also had the feature-length pilot episode. In Region 2, March 2017 saw the complete series released under its German title Ihr Auftritt Al Mundy, with both German and English soundtracks included. In Region 4, Madman Entertainment has released the entire series on DVD in Australia and New Zealand as three season box sets. Syndication As of early May 2012, It Takes a Thief could be seen in syndication on the Antenna TV network. Film In 2013, Universal Pictures announced they were developing a film version of the series with John Davis producing through Davis Entertainment, along with Joseph Singer. Derek Dauchy would supervise the project for Davis and Scott Bernstein for Universal. Greg Russo would write the script.Universal Turning 1970s Series 'It Takes a Thief' into Film (EXCLUSIVE) There have been no developments since that time.

Clark Development was founded by Fred Clark. PCBoard was one of the first commercial BBS packages for DOS systems, and was considered one of the \\"high end\\" packages during the rapid expansion of BBS systems in the early 1990s. Like many BBS companies, the rise of the Internet starting around 1994 led to serious downturns in fortunes, and Clark Development went bankrupt in 1997. Most PCB sales were of two-line licenses; additional line licenses (in ranges of 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250 and 1000) were also available. A native 32-bit IBM OS/2 version became also available with PCB V15.22 and higher. There were also a few tools available for PCBoard, which were specifically developed for the OS/2 2.0 and OS/2 Warp operating system. Multinode support PCBoard supported the 16C550 UARTs (universal asynchronous receiver transmitter), such as 16550 UART (\\"Fifo\\"), 16554 UART and 16650 UART, which made it possible to run multiple nodes of the BBS on a single (multitasking) computer using either using IBM OS/2 or the DOS multitasking tool DESQview in combination with the memory manager QEMM. Some sysops tried to run PCBoard on the (then) new Windows 95 operating system by MicrosoftRunning PCBoard under Windows 95, NT 3.5x and 4.x, UE-00149.TXT, Underground Empire, retrieved June 16, 2007 and reported mixed results. Stability was critical for a BBS, which was usually running 24/7, and the early version of the Microsoft 32-bit operating system lacked it. Windows 95 was never officially supported by CDC. Standard PCs then and today have only one or two (if any) serial ports (COM ports), which are needed to connect an external modem to a computer. This made multiport cards like the G-Tek \\"BlackBoard\\", \\"BBS550\\" or \\"SmartCard\\" and the \\"DigiCard\\" by Digi International popular among sysops. Other options were internal multi-modem cards and multiple computers connected by local area network. PCBoard also supports ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) and Telnet access via the Internet. The open source terminal emulator SyncTERM, available for Win32, Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris and Mac OS X can be used for example to connect to the few remaining PCBoard BBS installations that are connected to the Internet. Multi-BBS networks Starting in 1988, the RelayNet, also known as RIME for RelayNet International Mail Exchange, allowed BBS's running PCBoard to join a network that exchanged messages with other BBS's in a system similar to the older FidoNet. History The first version of PCBoard was released in 1983. Clark Development Company (CDC) pioneered the FILE ID.DIZ formatRichard Holler (May 17, 1994), FAQ file_id.diz, ASP (Association of Shareware Professionals), online version from Textfiles.com retrieved August 4, 2007 as well as a powerful scripting language (PPL), which supported modifications and to a large degree replacement of most standard commands and processes. A compiled interpreter script written in PPL was called PPE (PCBoard Programming Executable). PPEs were generated by the PCBoard Programming Language Compiler (PPLC), which was an optional tool provided by Clark Development Company and was also available for purchase as stand alone tool. It was less than $100 by itself and less than $50 in combination with any BBS license. This allowed programmers to develop PPEs for PCBoard without having to purchase a PCBoard BBS license. Also optional and available by itself were the printed PCBoard manual and the printed PPLC reference handbook. The script language was introduced with version 15.0 and made this version of PCBoard even more successful than PCBoard V14.5. Various door programs were in use, including Sam Smith's Prodoor, which added a full screen editor and other features which were later included in PCBoard itself. The script language PPL and PPE's which became more and more available, increased the popularity of PCBoard and emerged by the mid nineties as the de facto-standard BBS system for warez BBS on the IBM PC. The warez BBS's used mostly pirated versions of the BBS software and thus did not appear in any official sales or usage statistic for the software. What PCBoard was for warez BBSes on the IBM PC, was Amiexpress for BBSes running on Commodore Amiga computers. Despite the high price tag Clark Development Company sold more than 50,000 PCBoard licenses by 1995. The last full release of PCBoard by Clark Development Company was version 15.3 in September 1996. Clark Technologies, a division of Clark Development Company announced on July 29, 1996 the availability of source code and OEM licenses for the PCBoard BBS software.MURRAY, Utah, Clark Technologies Offers Source Code and OEM Licenses for PCBoard, PR Newswire via Highbeam.com, retrieved June 7, 2007 The final release was 15.4 beta, which had a one-month trial period. Later, the lead software engineer from Clark Development Company released information on how to bypass the trial period timeout;David Terry (June 16, 1997), (1 Mw-tech) PCBoard Beta Patch, bbsdocumentary.com, retrieved June 4, 2007 the timeout had been inserted as a reminder and had not been intended to permanently disable the software. Clark Development Company went bankrupt in July 1997 and closed its offices without prior warning, leaving a great number of upset customers behind. Customers were never notified by the company, and customers who had just purchased licences for the software were not notified, refunded or provided access to the software they had paid for.Lisa Carricaburu (Friday, June 20, 1997), \\"Clark Development Is No More\\" (online at textfiles.com),The Salt Lake Tribune PCBoard after CDC Sysops continued to use PCBoard around the world, even after support by CDC stopped when the company went out of business. Help was available from many individuals who created tools and documentation for the PCBoard system. The company did not exist anymore when the Year 2000 problem, also known as the Y2K problem or millennium bug, made headline news. However, PCBoard only had a few minor problems with the year 2000 (and 2001) and fixes were made available by several individuals.PCB Y2K patches collection of patches from various sources The last full release version of PCBoard, version 15.3, never really caught on and most systems that were online after 1997 continued to use the previous 15.2x versions of the software. PCBoard is still in use today by nostalgic BBS fans. There is a freeware FOSSIL driver called NetFoss which allows PCBoard to be accessible via telnet under Windows. There was also a DOS based PCBoard add-on \\"PCB Internet Collection\\" which allowed telnet access by installing a (DOS-only) packet driver.

A number of commercial PPEs were also developed, mostly under shareware licensing. A number of release groups who were specialized in PPE and other PCB/BBS tool developments were formed, such as the French group Aegis Corp, the Russian group Brutal PPE/PCE/PRO Coders (BPC) and the German groups Peanuts (PNS) and Paranoia (PNA). Warez groups Such as PWA and DOD released several PPEs which were used by many sysops, including the PWA \\"NewScan\\" PPE, the PWA \\"Files-Reverse\\" PPE and the DOD \\"LARS Upload Processor\\". The French group Aegis Corp distributed a PPE De-compiler (PPLX) written by Lone Runner, which allowed the de-compilation of PPE binaries back to human-readable PPL code. Lone Runner also wrote the Aegis PPL compiler, which produced smaller and faster code than Clark Development's original PPL compiler. Other tools for PPE developers followed. Another PPE De-compiler was PPLDecompiler (PPLD) written by CHiCKEN, a member of the \\"Swiss Coding Division\\" of the group Electronic Rats (EcR). PCBoard Metaworlds Metaworlds was an attempt by CDC to establish a BBS-like environment on the Internet, basically a closed mailbox in HTML format online. Access to the content was only possible for registered users who had to authenticate themselves with username and password to access the system. Metaworlds supported the parallel operation with the standard ANSI based PCBoard BBS software and used Microsoft SQL Server as underlying database. A runtime- version of Microsoft SQL Server came with the Metaworlds software. CDC went out of business before Metaworlds was finished. Metaworlds was developed by CDC to make the transition to the Internet when the decline of the BBS became apparent.The Mighty SCI,PCBoard Newsletter #2 - FAQ Section (German),Underground Empire,retrieved June 16, 2007 See also * FILE_ID.DIZ (for DESC.SDI files) ReferencesExternal links *Brief history of PCBoard from bbsdocumentary.com (and software downloads) *153 PCBoard PPE's by PWA at The BBS Archive *PCboard File Archive A-C (556 PPE's), D-F (333 PPE's), G-I (188 PPE's), J-O (358 PPE's), P-R (354 PPE's), S-Z (337 PPE's) at The BBS Archive *PCBoard file archive,Filegate.net *DOS BBS software, Mpoli.fi *Sysop's corner list of PCB related sites *Original Install Disks and Collection of over 4,000 PPE's & Tools Category:Bulletin board system software Category:DOS software Category:OS/2 software Category:1983 software ","title":"PCBoard"},{"id":"1505977","text":"Bishop's Ring around the sun due to volcanic ash of the Eyjafjallaj√∂kull volcano on Iceland. Photographed from Leiden, the Netherlands, on 18 May 2010. A Bishop's Ring is a diffuse brown or bluish halo observed around the sun. It is typically observed after large volcanic eruptions. The first recorded observation of a Bishop's Ring was by Rev. Sereno Edwards BishopA brief biography of the Reverend Sereno Edward Bishop (with photo) appears on pages 171‚Äì172 of: Kevin Hamilton (2012) \\"Sereno Bishop, Rollo Russell, Bishop's Ring and the discovery of the \\"Krakatoa easterlies\\",\\" Atmosphere-Ocean, vol. 50, no. 2, pages 169‚Äì175. of Honolulu, after the Krakatoa eruption of August 27, 1883.See: * Bishop, Sereno E.

See: Part IV., Section I.(E) The large corona round the sun and moon in 1883-4-5, generally known as \\"Bishop's ring.\\" by Mr. E. Douglas Archibald, pages 232‚Äì263. This gigantic explosion threw a vast quantity of dust and volatile gases into the atmosphere. Sulfate aerosols remained in the stratosphere, causing colorful sunrises and sunsets for several years. The first observation of this ring was published in 1883, being described as a ‚Äúfaint halo‚Äù around the sun. Bishop observed the phenomenon on September 5, 1883; the phenomenon was subsequently named after him, and was the subject of an 1886 professorial dissertation (Habilitationsschrift) by Albert Riggenbach. Most observations agree that the inner rim of the ring is whitish or bluish white and that its outside is reddish, brownish or purple. The area enclosed by the ring is significantly brighter than its surroundings. From the sequence of colors with the red on the outside one can conclude that the phenomenon is caused by diffraction because halos always have their red part on their inside.Among the first people to recognize that Bishop's ring was a result of the diffraction of sunlight by dust particles was the Swiss physicist Eduard Hagenbach-Bischoff. See: Fran√ßois-Alphonse Forel (1884) \\"La couronne solaire de l'√©t√© de 1884\\" (The solar corona of the summer of 1884), Archives des sciences physiques et naturelles, series 3, vol. 12, pages 173‚Äì184; see especially page 182, where Forel says that the corona was not consistent with a 22¬∞ halo, which is produced by refractions through ice crystals. On average, the radius of the ring is about 28¬∞, but it can vary between 10¬∞ and 30¬∞, depending on the dust size.Asano, S. (1993) \\"Estimation of the size distribution of Pinatubo volcanic dust from Bishop's Ring simulations.\\" Geophysical Research Letters 20(6): 447‚Äì450. The maximum of 30¬∞ is a rather big radius which can only be caused by very small dust particles (0.002 mm) which all have to be of about the same size. Sulfur compound aerosols derived from volcanic eruptions have been found to be the source for the Bishop's Ring effect.Kenneth Sassen, Thomas Peter, Beiping P. Luo, and Paul J. Crutzen (1994) \\"Volcanic Bishop‚Äôs ring: evidence for a sulfuric acid tetrahydrate particle aureole,\\" Applied Optics 33: 4602‚Äì4606.

Early life and education Stark An advertisement for Scott Joplin's \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" from the back page of a rag by Joseph Lamb. Both published with Stark's firm. Stark was the eleventh of twelve children born to Adin Stark and Eleanor Stillwell Stark of Shelby County, Kentucky. He grew up on a farm in Bean Blossom, Indiana, and served in the Union Army during the American Civil War, where he played the bugle. He married Sarah Ann Casey and raised a family, earning his living as a farmer, first in Indiana and then in Missouri near Maysville. His other children were E.J. Stark, who became a well known composer of ragtime, and Eleanor, who was a talented musician. Eventually John Stark tired of farming and moved to Cameron, where he went into the new business of ice-cream making. After moving to Chillicothe, he supplemented his income by selling organs and pianos. Career In 1885, Stark settled in Sedalia, Missouri and entered the music business full-time, opening an office at 516 Ohio Street and founding John Stark and Son with his 15-year-old son William. He got into the publishing business after buying out J. W. Truxel, one of his competitors, who owned seven copyrights. It was in Sedalia that Stark heard Scott Joplin play the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\", and on August 10, 1899, he bought the number for fifty dollars plus royalties of one cent per copy. It proved a prosperous arrangement for both men. After an initial printing of 5,000 copies, a million were eventually sold, which enabled Stark to open an office in St. Louis, Missouri (and, in 1905, New York City) and Joplin to engage in composing for a living. Over the next two decades, Stark published and promoted the \\"classic\\" style rag pioneered by Joplin with a lineup that included Joseph Lamb, James Scott, Arthur Marshall, Paul Pratt, Artie Matthews, Robert Hampton, J. Russel Robinson, and Etilmon J. Stark (his son). Later life and death After his wife died in 1910, Stark closed his New York office and returned to St. Louis. By this time New York's Tin Pan Alley was dominating ragtime music sales. He continued to bring out new rags until 1922, well after ragtime had succumbed to jazz, which Stark detested. Stark died in St. Louis on October 21, 1927.

Crystal violet has antibacterial, antifungal, and anthelmintic properties and was formerly important as a topical antiseptic. The medical use of the dye has been largely superseded by more modern drugs, although it is still listed by the World Health Organization. The name gentian violet was originally used for a mixture of methyl pararosaniline dyes (methyl violet), but is now often considered a synonym for crystal violet. The name refers to its colour, being like that of the petals of certain gentian flowers; it is not made from gentians or violets. Production A number of possible routes can be used to prepare crystal violet. The original procedure developed by the German chemists Kern and Caro involved the reaction of dimethylaniline with phosgene to give 4,4‚Ä≤-bis(dimethylamino)benzophenone (Michler's ketone) as an intermediate. This was then reacted with additional dimethylaniline in the presence of phosphorus oxychloride and hydrochloric acid. The dye can also be prepared by the condensation of formaldehyde and dimethylaniline to give a leuco dye:.

The colour of the dye depends on the acidity of the solution. At a pH of +1.0, the dye is green with absorption maxima at 420 nm and 620 nm, while in a strongly acidic solution (pH ‚àí1.0), the dye is yellow with an absorption maximum at 420 nm. The different colours are a result of the different charged states of the dye molecule. In the yellow form, all three nitrogen atoms carry a positive charge, of which two are protonated, while the green colour corresponds to a form of the dye with two of the nitrogen atoms positively charged. At neutral pH, both extra protons are lost to the solution, leaving only one of the nitrogen atoms positive charged. The pKa for the loss of the two protons are approximately 1.15 and 1.8. In alkaline solutions, nucleophilic hydroxyl ions attack the electrophilic central carbon to produce the colourless triphenylmethanol or carbinol form of the dye. Some triphenylmethanol is also formed under very acidic conditions when the positive charges on the nitrogen atoms lead to an enhancement of the electrophilic character of the central carbon, which allows the nucleophilic attack by water molecules. This effect produces a slight fading of the yellow colour. Applications=Nonmedical Bacteria stained with crystal violet Crystal violet is not only used as a textile dye, but also it is used to dye paper and as a component of navy blue and black inks for printing, ball-point pens, and inkjet printers. It is also used to colourize diverse products such as fertilizers, antifreezes, detergents, and leather. The dye is also used as a histological stain, particularly in Gram staining for classifying bacteria. When conducting DNA gel electrophoresis, crystal violet can be used as a nontoxic DNA stain as an alternative to fluorescent, intercalating dyes such as ethidium bromide. Used in this manner, it may be either incorporated into the agarose gel or applied after the electrophoresis process is finished. Used at a 0.001% concentration and allowed to stain a gel after electrophoresis for 30 minutes, it can detect as little as 16 ng of DNA. Through use of a methyl orange counterstain and a more complex staining method, sensitivity can be improved further to 8 ng of DNA. When crystal violet is used as an alternative to fluorescent stains, it is not necessary to use ultraviolet illumination; this has made crystal violet popular as a means of avoiding UV-induced DNA destruction when performing DNA cloning in vitro. In biomedical research, crystal violet can be used to stain the nuclei of adherent cells. In this application, crystal violet works as a intercalating dye and allows the quantification of DNA which is proportional to the number of cells. In forensics, crystal violet was used to develop fingerprints. Crystal violet is also used as a tissue stain in the preparation of light microscopy sections. In laboratory, solutions containing crystal violet and formalin are often used to simultaneously fix and stain cells grown in tissue culture to preserve them and make them easily visible, since most cells are colourless. It is also sometimes used as a cheap way to put identification markings on laboratory mice; since many strains of lab mice are albino, the purple colour stays on their fur for several weeks. In body piercing, gentian violet is commonly used to mark the location for placing piercings, including surface piercings. Medical Gentian violet has antibacterial, antifungal, antihelminthic, antitrypanosomal, antiangiogenic, and antitumor properties. It is used medically for these properties, in particular for dentistry, and is also known as \\"pyoctanin\\" (or \\"pyoctanine\\"). It is commonly used for: *Marking the skin for surgery preparation and allergy testing; *Treating Candida albicans and related fungal infections, such as thrush, yeast infections, various types of tinea (ringworm, athlete's foot, jock itch); *Treating impetigo; it was used primarily before the advent of antibiotics, but still useful to persons who may be allergic to penicillin. In resource-limited settings, gentian violet is used to manage burn wounds, inflammation of the umbilical cord stump (omphalitis) in the neonatal period, oral candidiasis in HIV-infected patients and mouth ulcers in children with measles. Veterinary Because of its antimicrobial activity, it is used to treat ich in fish. However, it usually is illegal to use in fish intended for human consumption. History Crystal violet base (methylrosanilide, tris[4-(dimethylamino)phenyl]methanol, C25H31N3O) Synthesis Crystal violet is one of the components of methyl violet, a dye first synthesized by Charles Lauth in 1861. From 1866, methyl violet was manufactured by the Saint-Denis-based firm of Poirrier et Chappat and marketed under the name \\"Violet de Paris\\". It was a mixture of the tetra-, penta- and hexamethylated pararosanilines. Crystal violet itself was first synthesized in 1883 by Alfred Kern (1850‚Äì1893) working in Basel at the firm of Bindschedler and Busch. To optimize the difficult synthesis which used the highly toxic phosgene, Kern entered into a collaboration with the German chemist Heinrich Caro at BASF. Kern also found that by starting with diethylaniline rather than dimethylaniline, he could synthesize the closely related violet dye now known as C.I. 42600 or C.I. Basic violet 4.; Also available from Google. Gentian violet The name \\"gentian violet\\" (or Gentianaviolett in German) is thought to have been introduced by the German pharmacist Georg Gr√ºbler, who in 1880 started a company in Leipzig that specialized in the sale of staining reagents for histology. The gentian violet stain marketed by Gr√ºbler probably contained a mixture of methylated pararosaniline dyes. The stain proved popular and in 1884 was used by Hans Christian Gram to stain bacteria. He credited Paul Ehrlich for the aniline-gentian violet mixture. (Earlier editions were authored by H.J. Conn) Gr√ºbler's gentian violet was probably very similar, if not identical, to Lauth's methyl violet, which had been used as a stain by Victor Andr√© Cornil in 1875. Although the name gentian violet continued to be used for the histological stain, the name was not used in the dye and textile industries. The composition of the stain was not defined and different suppliers used different mixtures. In 1922, the Biological Stain Commission appointed a committee chaired by Harold Conn to look into the suitability of the different commercial products. In his book Biological Stains, Conn describes gentian violet as a \\"poorly defined mixture of violet rosanilins\\". The German ophthalmologist Jakob Stilling is credited with discovering the antiseptic properties of gentian violet. He published a monograph in 1890 on the bactericidal effects of a solution that he christened \\"pyoktanin\\", which was probably a mixture of aniline dyes similar to gentian violet. He set up a collaboration with E. Merck & Co. to market \\"Pyoktanin caeruleum\\" as an antiseptic. In 1902, Drigalski and Conradi found that although crystal violet inhibited the growth of many bacteria, it has little effect on Bacillus coli (Escherichia coli) and Bacillus typhi (Salmonella typhi), which are both Gram- negative bacteria. A much more detailed study of the effects of Gr√ºbler's gentian violet on different strains of bacteria was published by John Churchman in 1912. He found that most Gram-positive bacteria were sensitive to the dye, while most Gram-negative bacteria were not, and observed that the dye tended to act as a bacteriostatic agent rather than a bactericide. =Precautions= One study in mice demonstrated dose-related carcinogenic potential at several different organ sites.Carcinogenic Potency Database (CPDB) The Food and Drug Administration in the US (FDA) has determined that gentian violet has not been shown by adequate scientific data to be safe for use in animal feed. Use of gentian violet in animal feed causes the feed to be adulterated and is a violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in the US. On June 28, 2007, the FDA issued an \\"import alert\\" on farm raised seafood from China because unapproved antimicrobials, including gentian violet, had been consistently found in the products. The FDA report states: \\"Like MG [malachite green], CV [crystal violet] is readily absorbed into fish tissue from water exposure and is reduced metabolically by fish to the leuco moiety, leucocrystal violet (LCV). Several studies by the National Toxicology Program reported the carcinogenic and mutagenic effects of crystal violet in rodents. The leuco form induces renal, hepatic and lung tumor in mice.\\" Health Canada recently found medical devices that use gentian violet to be safe for use but recommended to stop using all drug products that contain gentian violet, including on animals, causing Canadian engineering schools to revisit the usage of this dye during orientation. In popular culture In Catch-22, the medics are portrayed as using gentian violet on feet and gums as a panacea. This may be inspired by the World War I practice of irrigating American soldiers' bladders and urethras with potassium permanganate, another bright purple compound, to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. In Picnic at Hanging Rock, the orphan Sara recounts how she was once punished by an orphanage's matron, who 'painted my head with gentian violet'. Engineering students in Canada use gentian violet to dye their skin and jackets, a tradition started in honor of naval engineers whose purple armbands would leave their skin dyed after countless days spent in the boiler rooms. Another story being that purple was the colour of the Titanic's engineers who stayed behind to delay the sinking of the ship.

Different models have been used for expeditions in the Arctic and the Antarctic during the second half of the 20th century. It differs from other truck-sized snow vehicles, commonly known as snowcats, by its use of four independently mounted sets of tracks. Early models 1949 dual-ski, dual- track Tucker Sno-Cat Curved-door Tucker Kitten variant While the majority of Tucker Sno-Cats utilized four sets of tracks, a few experimental models and early production models used two sets of tracks. Initially Tucker Sno-Cats employed two front-mounted steering skis and two sets of tracks mounted to the rear. However, there are at least three production models that only employed dual tracks‚Äîthe small 222 Tucker Kitten, the 322, and the 323 models were all two-track Tucker Sno-Cats with a conventional front engine design. There are at least two variants of the Tucker Kitten, some have square corner doors while others have rounded corner doors. The Kitten was powered by a 10 hp engine. Additionally there was at least one prototype featuring two tracks and a mid-engine design. Rare dual-track Tucker 323 Sno-Cat Restored 1967 Tucker Model 342 The more common four track Tucker Sno-Cats are considered to be the classic Sno-Cats in American history and have been used extensively in both polar regions for exploration, as well as for transportation, trail grooming and industrial applications. The body style could be configured in many ways and sedan styles, enclosed cargo styles and open bed configurations were all available. Model numbers designated the configuration of the unit, for example a Model 342 was a \\"300\\" series, four-track, two-door Tucker Sno-Cat. A Model 443 would be a \\"400\\" series, four-track, three-door unit. In the early models, there were ultimately series 200 through 900, with the higher numbers being larger units. The 500 series Tuckers employed extra wide tracks which allowed them to carry heavy loads in very deep soft snow conditions. The early model Tucker Sno-Cats all utilized a unique steel track that revolved around a steel pontoon, the steel pontoons were eventually replaced by fiberglass pontoons. As the models evolved, the steel tracks were replaced with a suspension system that employed rubber belts that were carried by a series of small wheels. Fastened to the exterior of the rubber belts are cleats, also called grousers, made of metal, to offer traction on the snow. Historical competitors While Tucker is still in business, its early competitors have not fared well in the face of competition. Other notable players in the North American snowcat market included Thiokol, Bombardier, KRISTI snowcat and Swedish manufacturer Aktiv Snow Trac. All the historical competitors to Tucker Sno-Cat made two- track snowcats. Thiokol of Utah sold its ski-lift and snowcat operations in 1978, with John Z DeLorean purchasing the snowcat division, and changed its name to DMC. DMC later was bought out by its management team and renamed Logan Machine Company more commonly known as LMC. LMC ceased production in 2000. Thiokol's Imp, Super-Imp and Spryte were most its popular products were continued by DMC and LMC and were commercial successes but could not support the entire company. Many of these models are still in use today in the commercial market and are popular as privately owned snowcats. KRISTI snowcat had a limited production of 2 track snowcats between 1956 and 1968 in Colorado, it was purchased by a group of Boeing engineers and moved to Washington where it ceased production in the early 1970s with a total production reported to be less than 180 units. Aktiv Snow Trac ceased production in 1982 when its engine supplier (Volkswagen) ceased production of its air-cooled engines in Europe. A majority of the more than 2,200 Snow Tracs made were imported to Canada and the United States, mostly by Canadian utilities and U.S. governmental agencies; the Snow Trac is still in common use in private ownership and to a lesser degree in commerce. Bombardier still continues in business but has radically altered its business model and product selection. Bombardier sold over 3,000 of its popular snow bus models which are still in use today and in popular demand by dedicated collectors. Track design evolution Image:Steel-Track.jpgOriginal steel tracks Image:Rubber- Belts.jpgBelted tracks Image:Terra-Track.jpgModern Terra track Tucker Sno- Cats were originally built with a steel track that rotates around a steel pontoon. Located at the top center of the pontoon is a drive sprocket with teeth that drive the chain-like tracks around the steel pontoon. Due to maintenance issues with rust on the steel pontoons, fiberglass pontoons eventually replaced some steel parts but the overall mechanism was basically unchanged. Steel tracks revolving around pontoons were replaced with a system that employed two rubber belts with metal cleats, or grousers, attached to the outside perimeter to grip the snow. A series of wheels and guides were used inside the belts. Two drive sprockets on a hub drive the rubber belted track. The most modern version of the Sno-Cat track is the all-rubber Terra Track system. This system uses a wide single rubber belt, constructed with a multi- ply design similar to a modern car tire. The exterior perimeter employs molded rubber treads instead of the steel grousers of prior models. Modern competitors and uses The Tucker Sno-Cat has many modern competitors fighting for the grooming business at ski-resorts and snowmobile clubs as trail groomers.,Lamtrac K√§ssbohrer Gel√§ndefahrzeug/Pisten Bully, VMC/UTV International, Scot-Trac as well as Sure Trac agricultural tractor conversions for snow grooming. Tucker Sno-Cats also builds machines for passenger transport in Arctic regions. The Sno-Cat product range also includes industrial machines for many industries, including fire suppression, drilling and crane operations. Antarctic exploration Canterbury Museum in Christchurch, New Zealand English explorer Sir Vivian Fuchs championed the first Trans-Antarctic expedition and utilized 4 specially prepared Tucker Sno- Cats. Tucker Sno-Cats are still considered a premier extreme condition vehicle and are still in use in both the Arctic and Antarctic regions. A Tucker Sno- Cat 743 was returned to the UK and is currently displayed in the Science Museum at Wroughton, and is currently only viewable via appointment at this location. Another of the same expedition's Sno-Cats is on display in the Antarctic section of the Canterbury Museum in Christchurch, New Zealand. A third is on display at the Antique Gas and Steam Engine Museum in Vista, California, United States.

Smyth served in the Virginia Senate, Virginia House of Delegates, United States House of Representatives and as a general during the War of 1812. Smyth County, Virginia, is named in his honor. Early life Smyth was born on the Island of Rathlin, Ireland. He immigrated to the United States with his father, Rev. Alfred Smythe at the age of 10, and settled in Botetourt County, Virginia, in 1775 where he completed preparatory studies. He studied law, and was admitted to the bar and commenced practice in Abingdon, Virginia. Smyth moved to Wythe County, Virginia, and was a member of the Virginia House of Delegates in 1792, 1796, 1801, 1802, and from 1804 to 1808. He served in the Virginia Senate in 1808 and 1809. Military career Smyth served in the United States Army from 1808 to 1813. Commissioned as a colonel in 1808, he served as Inspector General to William Eustis, the acting War Secretary. Shortly after the outbreak of the War of 1812, Smyth was promoted to brigadier general on July 6, 1812. During the Battle of Queenston Heights he refused to support his commander, General Stephen Van Rensselaer, a militia commander with no experience. After Van Rensselaer's disgrace, Smyth was given command and proved himself equally inept. His plan to invade Canada started with the Battle of Frenchman's Creek but was then abandoned because of problems due to poor organization.Quimby, p. 77 After the failed attack on Canada, Smyth was insulted by Brigadier General Peter B. Porter, who accused Smyth of cowardice. Smyth challenged Porter to a duel, but both men went unscathed. The historian John R. Elting wrote of the duel, stating, \\"Unfortunately, both missed.\\"Elting, p. 51 In the wake of his failure, Smyth's name was removed from the U.S. Army rolls.Quimby, p. 78 Postwar career After the war, Smyth resumed the practice of law, and again became a member of the Virginia House of Delegates in 1816, 1817, 1826, and 1827.

Biography James Dalrymple descended from several generations of a family inclined to the principles of the Reformation. He had ancestors among the Lollards of Kyleboth both on his father's and his mother's side. His father, James Dalrymple, laird of the small estate of Stair in the District of Kyle, Ayrshire, died when he was an infant. His mother, Janet Kennedy of Knockdaw, is described as \\"a woman of excellent spirit\\", who took care to have him well-educated. From the grammar school at Mauchline he went, in 1633, to the University of Glasgow, where he graduated in arts on 26 July 1637. Next year he went to Edinburgh, probably with the intention of studying law, but the troubles of the times, then approaching a crisis, led him to change his course, and we next find him serving in the Earl of Glencairn's regiment in the War of the Covenant. What part he took in it is not certainly known, but he was in command of a troop when recalled in 1641 to compete for a regency (as a tutorship or professorship was then called) in the University of Glasgow. He was elected in March. Mathematics, logic, ethics and politics were the chief subjects of his lectures, and a notebook on logic by one of his students has been preserved. His activity and skill in matters of college business were praised by his colleagues, who numbered amongst them some of the leading Covenanting divines, and his zeal in teaching was gratefully acknowledged by his students. After nearly seven years' service he resigned his regency, and removed to Edinburgh, where he was admitted to the bar on 17 February 1648. This step had probably been rendered easier by his marriage, four years before, to Margaret Ross, co- heiress of Balneil in Wigtown. Stair's practice at the bar does not appear to have been large. His talents lay rather in the direction of learning and business than of oratory or advocacy. His reputation and the confidence reposed in him were shown by his appointment in 1649 as secretary to the commission sent to the Hague to treat with Charles II by the Scots Parliament. The negotiation having been broken off through the unwillingness of the young king to accept the terms of the Covenanters, Stair was again sent in the following year to Breda, where the failure of Montrose's expedition forced Charles to change his attitude and to return to Scotland as the covenanted king. Stair had preceded him, and met him on his landing in Aberdeenshire, probably carrying with him the news of the execution of Montrose, which he had witnessed. During the Commonwealth of England, Stair continued to practise at the bar, but like most of his brethren he refused in 1654 to take the oath of allegiance to the Commonwealth. Three years later, on the death of James Learmonth, Lord Balcomie, Stair was appointed one of the Commissioners for the Administration of Justice in Scotland, on the recommendation of Monk. His appointment to the bench on 1 July 1657, by Monk, was confirmed by Oliver Cromwell on the 26th. Stair's association with the English judges at this time must have enlarged his acquaintance with English law, as his travels had extended his knowledge of the civil law and the modern European systems which followed it. He thus acquired a singular advantage when he came to write on law, regarding it from a cosmopolitan, or international, rather than a merely local or national point of view. His actual discharge of judicial duty at this time was short, for after the death of Cromwell the courts in Scotland were shut‚Äîa new commission issued in 1660 not having taken effect, it being uncertain in whose name the commission ought to run. It was during this period that Stair became intimate with Monk, who is said to have been advised by him when he left Scotland to call a full and free parliament. Soon after the Restoration Stair went to London, where he was received with favour by Charles, knighted, and included in the new nomination of judges in the Court of Session on 13 February 1661. He was also put on various important commissions, busied himself with local and agricultural affairs, and, like most of the Scottish judges of this and the following century, acted with zest and credit the part of a good country gentleman. In 1662 he was one of the judges who refused to take the declaration that the National Covenant and the Solemn League and Covenant were unlawful oaths, and, forestalling the deposition which had been threatened as the penalty of continued non- compliance, he placed his resignation in the king's hands. The king, however, summoned him to London, and allowed him to take the declaration under an implied reservation. The next five years of Stair's life were comparatively uneventful, but in 1669 a family calamity, the exact facts of which will probably never be ascertained, overtook him. His daughter Janet, who had been betrothed to Lord Rutherfurd, was married to Dunbar of Baldoon, and some tragic incident occurred on the wedding night, from the effects of which she never recovered. As the traditions vary on the central fact, whether it was the bride who stabbed her husband, or the husband who stabbed the bride, no credence can be given to the mass of superstitions and spiteful slander which surrounded it, principally levelled at Lady Stair. Sir Walter Scott took the plot of his Bride of Lammermoor from this incident, but he disclaimed any intention of making Lord Stair the basis for Sir William Ashton. In 1670 Stair served as one of the Scottish commissioners who went to London to treat of the Union, but the project, not seriously pressed by Charles and his ministers, broke down through a claim on the part of the Scots to what was deemed an excessive representation in the British parliament. In January 1671 Stair was appointed Lord President of the Court of Session. In the following year, and again in 1673, he was returned to parliament for Wigtownshire, and took part in the important legislation of those years in the department of private law. During the bad time of Lauderdale's government Stair used his influence in the Privy Council and with Lauderdale to mitigate the severity of the orders passed against ecclesiastical offenders, but for the most part he abstained from attending a board whose policy he could not approve. In 1679 he went to London to defend the court against charges of partiality and injustice which had been made against it, and was thanked by his brethren for his success. When, in the following year, the Duke of York came to Scotland Stair distinguished himself by a bold speech, in which he congratulated the duke on his coming amongst a nation which was entirely Protestant. This speech can have been little relished, and the duke was henceforth his implacable enemy. His influence prevented Stair from being made Chancellor in 1681, on the death of the Duke of Rothes. The parliament of this year, in which Stair again sat, was memorable for two statutes, one in private law and the other in public law. The former, relating to the testing of deeds, was drawn by Stair, and is sometimes called by his name. The other was the infamous Test Act, probably the worst of the many measures devised at this period with the object of fettering the conscience by oaths. Stair also had a minor share in the form which this law finally took, but it was confined to the insertion of a definition of \\"the Protestant religion\\", by which he hoped to make the test harmless, but his expectation was disappointed. Yet, self-contradictory and absurd as it was, the Test Act was at once rigidly enforced. Argyll, who declared he took it only insofar as it was consistent with itself and the Protestant religion, was tried and condemned for treason and narrowly saved his life by escaping from Edinburgh Castle the day before that fixed for his execution. Stair, dreading a similar fate, went to London to seek a personal interview with the king, who had more than once befriended him, perhaps remembering his services in the Netherlands, but the Duke of York intercepted his access to the royal ear, and when he returned to Scotland he found a new commission of judges issued, from which his name was omitted. He retired to his wife's estate in Galloway, and occupied himself with preparing for the press his great work, The Institutions of the Law of Scotland, which he published in the autumn of 1681, with a dedication to the king. He was not, however, allowed to pursue his legal studies in peaceful retirement. His wife was charged with attending conventicles, his factor and tenants severely fined, and he was himself not safe from prosecution at any moment. A fierce dispute arose between Claverhouse and Stair's son, John, Master of Stair, relative to the regality of Glenluce, and, both having appealed to the Privy Council, Claverhouse, as might have been expected, was cleared of all the charges brought against him and the Master was deprived of the regality. Stair had still powerful friends, but his opponents were more powerful, and he received advice to quit the country. He repaired to Holland in October 1684, and took up his residence, along with his wife and some of his younger children, at Leiden. While there he published the Decisions of the Court of Session between 1666 and 1671, of which he had kept a daily record, and a small treatise on natural philosophy, entitled Physiologia nova experimentalis. In his absence a prosecution for treason was raised1 against him and others of the exiles by Sir George Mackenzie, the Lord Advocate. He was charged with accession to the rebellion of 1679, the Rye House Plot, and the expedition of Argyll. With the first two he had no connexion. With Argyll's unfortunate attempt he had no doubt sympathized, but the only proof of his complicity was slight, and was obtained by torture. The proceedings against him were never brought to an issue, having been continued by successive adjournments until 1687, when they were dropped. The cause of their abandonment was the appointment of his son, the Master of Stair, who had made his peace with James II, as Lord Advocate in place of Mackenzie, who was dismissed from office for refusing to relax the penal laws against the Roman Catholics. The Master only held office as Lord Advocate for a year, when he was \\"degraded to be Justice Clerk\\" the king and his advisers finding him not a fit tool for their purpose. Stair remained in Holland till the following year, when he returned under (from the Protestant viewpoint) happier auspices in the suite of William of Orange. William, who had made his acquaintance through Fagel, Grand Pensionary of the States of Holland, was ever afterwards the firm friend of Stair and his family. The Master was made Lord Advocate, and, on the murder of Lockhart of Carnwath in the following year, Stair was again placed at the head of the Court of Session. An unscrupulous opposition, headed by Montgomery of Skelmorlie who coveted the office of Secretary for Scotland, and Lord Ross, who aimed at the presidency of the court, sprang up in the Scottish parliament, and an anonymous pamphleteer, perhaps Montgomery himself or Ferguson the Plotter, attacked Stair in a pamphlet entitled The Late Proceedings of the Parliament of Scotland Stated and Vindicated. He defended himself by publishing an Apology, which, in the opinion of impartial judges, was a complete vindication. Shortly after its issue he was created Viscount Stair (1690). He had now reached the summit of his prosperity, and the few years which remained of his old age were saddened by private and public cares. In 1692 he lost his wife, the faithful partner of his good and evil fortune for nearly fifty years. The massacre of the Macdonalds of Glencoe (13 February 1692), which has marked his son, the Master of Stair, with a stain which his great services to the state cannot efface‚Äîfor he was undoubtedly the principal adviser of William in that treacherous and cruel deed, as a signal way of repressing rebellion in the Highlands‚Äîwas used as an opportunity by his adversaries of renewing their attack on the old president. His own share in the crime was remote. It was alleged that he had as a privy councillor declined to receive Glencoe's oath of allegiance, though tendered, on the technical ground that it was given after the day fixed, but even this was not clearly proved. But some share of the odium which attached to his son was naturally reflected on him. Other grounds of complaint were not difficult to make up, which found willing supporters in the opposition members of parliament. A disappointed suitor brought in a bill in 1693 complaining of his partiality. He was also accused of domineering over the other judges and of favouring the clients of his sons. Two bills were introduced without naming him but really aimed at him‚Äîone to disqualify peers from being judges and the other to confer on the Crown a power to appoint temporary presidents of the court. The complaint against him was remitted to a committee, which, after full inquiry, completely exculpated him, and the two bills, whose incompetency he demonstrated in an able paper addressed to the commission and parliament, were allowed to drop. He was also one of a parliamentary commission which prepared a report on the regulation of the judicatures, afterwards made the basis of a statute in 1695 supplementary to that of 1672, and forming the foundation of the judicial procedure in the Scottish courts for many years. On 29 November 1695 Stair, who had been for some time in failing health, died at his house in Edinburgh, aged 76, and was buried in the church of St Giles. His Edinburgh house, the former palace of Mary of Guise on the Castlehill was purchased by John Wightman of Mauldslie, a future Lord Provost of Edinburgh. It was redeveloped in 1843 to build New College.https://randomscottishhistory.com/2018/03/07/chapter-9-the-castle- hill-concluded-pp-87-94/ In 1695 there was published in London a small volume with the title A Vindication of the Divine Perfections, Illustrating the Glory of God in them by Reason and Revelation, methodically digested By a Person of Honour. It was edited by the two Nonconformist divines, William Bates and John Howe, who had been in exile in the Netherlands along with Stair, and is undoubtedly his work. Perhaps it had been a sketch of the \\" Inquiry Concerning Natural Theology \\" which he had contemplated writing in 1681. It is of no value as a theological work, for Stair was no more a theologian than he was a man of science, but it is of interest as showing the serious bent of his thoughts and the genuine piety of his character. Works Stair's major legal work, The Institutions of the Law of Scotland deduced from its Originals, and collated with the Civil, Canon and Feudal Laws and with the Customs of Neighbouring Nations, shows influences from his philosophical training, his foreign travels, and Continental jurists as well as English lawyers. Its name lives on in the Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, which provides a contemporary statement of the Laws of Scotland.Law Society of Scotland Journal Online The Physiologia was favourably noticed by Robert Boyle. Offspring Stair was fortunate in his descendants. \\"The family of Dalrymple\\", observed Sir Walter Scott, \\"produced within two centuries as many men of talent, civil and military, of literary, political and professional eminence, as any house in Scotland.\\" His five sons were all remarkable in their professions: *John, Master of Stair (1648‚Äì1707), who was succeeded as 2nd Viscount of Stair and was later created 1st Earl of Stair in 1703, an able lawyer and politician, who is, however, principally remembered for his part in the massacre of Glencoe, is dealt with above. *Sir James Dalrymple, 1st Baronet, created a baronet in 1698, was one of the principal Clerks of Session, and a very thorough and accurate historical antiquary. *Sir Hew Dalrymple of North Berwick (1652‚Äì1737) succeeded his father as president, and was reckoned one of the best lawyers and speakers of his time. He, too, was created a baronet in 1698. *Thomas Dalrymple became physician to Queen Anne. *Sir David Dalrymple, 1st Baronet (1665‚Äì1721), who was created a baronet in 1701, was Lord Advocate under Anne and George I. In 1709 he bought a fine Palladian mansion house, Whitehill (designed and built by the Scottish architect James Smith, 1645-1731), from Lord Bellenden and renamed it Newhailes. It stands to this day near Musselburgh, East Lothian, not far from Edinburgh. His grandson was the famous judge and historian, Lord Hailes. Stair's grandson, John (1673‚Äì1747), rose to be a field-marshal and gained equal credit in war and diplomacy. He was ambassador in Paris (1715‚Äì1720), and, besides seeing service under Marlborough, was commander-in-chief of the British forces on the Continent in 1742, showing great gallantry at Dettingen. He had no son, and in 1707 had selected his nephew John (1720‚Äì1789) as heir to the title, but through a decision of the House of Lords in 1748 he only became 5th Earl, after his cousin James and James's son had succeeded as 3rd and 4th Earls. John's son, the 6th Earl, died without issue, and a cousin again succeeded as 7th Earl, his two sons becoming 8th and 9th Earls. The 8th Earl (1771-1853) was a general in the army, and Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland. The 9th Earl's son and grandson succeeded as 10th and 11th Earls.

There was a real Cyrano de Bergerac, and the play is a fictionalisation following the broad outlines of his life. The entire play is written in verse, in rhyming couplets of twelve syllables per line, very close to the classical alexandrine form, but the verses sometimes lack a caesura. It is also meticulously researched, down to the names of the members of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise and the dames pr√©cieuses glimpsed before the performance in the first scene. The play has been translated and performed many times, and is responsible for introducing the word \\"panache\\" into the English language. Cyrano (the character) is in fact famed for his panache, and he himself makes reference to \\"my panache\\" in the play. The two most famous English translations are those by Brian Hooker and Anthony Burgess. Plot summary Hercule Savinien de Cyrano de Bergerac, a cadet (nobleman serving as a soldier) in the French Army, is a brash, strong-willed man of many talents. In addition to being a remarkable duelist, he is a gifted, joyful poet and is also a musical artist. However, he has an obnoxiously large nose, which causes him to doubt himself. This doubt prevents him from expressing his love for his distant cousin, the beautiful and intellectual Roxane, as he believes that his ugliness would prevent him the \\"dream of being loved by even an ugly woman.\\" Act I ‚Äì A Performance at the H√¥tel Burgundy The play opens in Paris, 1640, in the theatre of the H√¥tel Burgundy. Members of the audience slowly arrive, representing a cross-section of Parisian society from pickpockets to nobility. Christian de Neuvillette, a handsome new cadet, arrives with Ligni√®re, a drunkard whom he hopes will identify the young woman with whom he has fallen in love. Ligni√®re recognizes her as Roxane, and tells Christian about her and the Count de Guiche's scheme to marry her off to the compliant Viscount Valvert. Meanwhile, Ragueneau and Le Bret are expecting Cyrano de Bergerac, who has banished the actor Montfleury from the stage for a month. After Ligni√®re leaves, Christian intercepts a pickpocket and, in return for his freedom, the pickpocket tells Christian of a plot against Ligni√®re. Christian departs to try to warn him. The play \\"Clorise\\" begins with Montfleury's entrance. Cyrano disrupts the play, forces Montfleury off stage, and compensates the manager for the loss of admission fees. The crowd is going to disperse when Cyrano lashes out at a pesky busybody, then is confronted by Valvert and duels with him while composing a ballade, wounding (and possibly killing) him as he ends the refrain (as promised, he ends each refrain with Qu'√† la fin de l'envoi, je touche!: \\"Then, as I end the refrain, thrust home!\\") When the crowd has cleared the theater, Cyrano and Le Bret remain behind, and Cyrano confesses his love for Roxane. Roxane's duenna then arrives, and asks where Roxane may meet Cyrano privately. Ligni√®re is then brought to Cyrano, having learned that one hundred hired thugs are waiting to ambush him on his way home. Cyrano, now emboldened, vows to take on the entire mob single-handed, and he leads a procession of officers, actors and musicians to the Porte de Nesle. Act II ‚Äì The Poets' Cookshop The next morning, at Ragueneau's bake shop, Ragueneau supervises various apprentice cooks in their preparations. Cyrano arrives, anxious about his meeting with Roxane. He is followed by a musketeer, a paramour of Ragueneau's domineering wife Lise, then the regular gathering of impoverished poets who take advantage of Ragueneau's hospitality. Cyrano composes a letter to Roxane expressing his deep and unconditional love for her, warns Lise about her indiscretion with the musketeer, and when Roxane arrives he signals Ragueneau to leave them alone. Roxane and Cyrano talk privately as she bandages his hand (injured from the fracas at the Port de Nesle); she thanks him for defeating Valvert at the theater, and talks about a man with whom she has fallen in love. Cyrano thinks that she is talking about him at first, and is ecstatic, but Roxane describes her beloved as \\"handsome,\\" and tells him that she is in love with Christian de Neuvillette. Roxane fears for Christian's safety in the predominantly Gascon company of Cadets, so she asks Cyrano to befriend and protect him. This he agrees to do. After she leaves, Cyrano's captain arrives with the cadets to congratulate him on his victory from the night before. They are followed by a huge crowd, including de Guiche and his entourage, but Cyrano soon drives them away. Le Bret takes him aside and chastises him for his behavior, but Cyrano responds haughtily. The Cadets press him to tell the story of the fight, teasing the newcomer Christian de Neuvillette. When Cyrano recounts the tale, Christian displays his own form of courage by interjecting several times with references to Cyrano's nose. Cyrano is angry, but remembering his promise to Roxane, he holds in his temper. Eventually Cyrano explodes, the shop is evacuated, and Cyrano reveals his identity as Roxane's cousin. Christian confesses his love for Roxane but his inability to woo because of his lack of intellect and wit. When Cyrano tells Christian that Roxane expects a letter from him, Christian is despondent, having no eloquence in such matters. Cyrano then offers his services, including his own unsigned letter to Roxane. The Cadets and others return to find the two men embracing, and are flabbergasted. The musketeer from before, thinking it was safe to do so, teases Cyrano about his huge nose and receives a slap in the face, and there was much rejoicing. Act III ‚Äì Roxane's Kiss Outside Roxane's house Ragueneau is conversing with Roxane's duenna. When Cyrano arrives, Roxane comes down and they talk about Christian: Roxane says that Christian's letters have been breathtaking‚Äîhe is more intellectual than even Cyrano, she declares. She also says that she loves Christian. When de Guiche arrives, Cyrano hides inside Roxane's house. De Guiche tells Roxane that he has come to say farewell. He has been made a colonel of an army regiment that is leaving that night to fight in the war with Spain. He mentions that the regiment includes Cyrano's guards, and he grimly predicts that he and Cyrano will have a reckoning. Afraid for Christian's safety if he should go to the front, Roxane quickly suggests that the best way for de Guiche to seek revenge on Cyrano would be for him to leave Cyrano and his cadets behind while the rest of the regiment goes on to military glory. After much flirtation from Roxane, de Guiche believes he should stay close by, concealed in a local monastery. When Roxane implies that she would feel more for de Guiche if he went to war, he agrees to march on steadfastly, leaving Cyrano and his cadets behind. He leaves, and Roxane makes the duenna promise she will not tell Cyrano that Roxane has robbed him of a chance to go to war. Roxane expects Christian to come visit her, and she tells the duenna to make him wait if he does. Cyrano presses Roxane to disclose that instead of questioning Christian on any particular subject, she plans to make Christian improvise about love. Although he tells Christian the details of her plot, when Roxane and her duenna leave, he calls for Christian who has been waiting nearby. Cyrano tries to prepare Christian for his meeting with Roxane, urging him to remember lines Cyrano has written. Christian however refuses saying he wants to speak to Roxane in his own words. Cyrano bows to this saying, \\"Speak for yourself, sir.\\" During their meeting Christian makes a fool of himself trying to speak seductively to Roxane. Roxane storms into her house, confused and angry. Thinking quickly, Cyrano makes Christian stand in front of Roxane's balcony and speak to her while Cyrano stands under the balcony whispering to Christian what to say. Eventually, Cyrano shoves Christian aside and, under cover of darkness, pretends to be Christian, wooing Roxane himself. In the process, he wins a kiss for Christian. Roxane and Christian are secretly married by a Capuchin. Outside, Cyrano meets deGuiche. Cyrano, his face concealed, impersonates a madman, with a tale of a trip to the Moon. De Guice is fascinated, and delays his journey to hear more. When Cyrano finally reveals his face, de Guiche suggests Cyrano should write a book. The newly wed couple's happiness is short-lived: de Guiche, angry to have lost Roxane, declares that he is sending the Cadets of Gascony to the front lines of the war with Spain. De Guiche triumphantly tells Cyrano that the wedding night will have to wait. Under his breath, Cyrano remarks that the news fails to upset him. Roxane, afraid for Christian, urges Cyrano to promise to keep him safe, to keep him out of dangerous situations, to keep him dry and warm, and to keep him faithful. Cyrano says that he will do what he can but that he cannot promise anything. Roxane begs Cyrano to promise to make Christian write to her every day. Brightening, Cyrano announces confidently that he can promise that. Act IV ‚Äì The Gascon Cadets The Siege of Arras. The Gascon Cadets are among many French forces now cut off by the Spanish, and they are starving. Cyrano, meanwhile, has been writing in Christian's name twice a day, smuggling letters across enemy lines. De Guiche, whom the Cadets despise, arrives and chastises them; Cyrano responds with his usual bravura, and de Guiche then signals a spy to tell the Spanish to attack the Cadets, informing them that they must hold the line until relief arrives. Then a coach arrives, and Roxane emerges from it. She tells how she was able to flirt her way through the Spanish lines. Cyrano tells Christian about the letters, and provides him a farewell letter to give to Roxane if he dies. After de Guiche departs, Roxane provides plenty of food and drink with the assistance of the coach's driver, Ragueneau. De Guiche attempts to convince Roxane to leave the battlefield for a second time. When she refuses, de Guiche says he will not leave a lady behind. This impresses the cadets who offer him their leftovers, which de Guiche declines but ends up catching the cadets' accent which makes him even more popular with the cadets. Roxane also tells Christian that, because of the letters, she has grown to love him for his soul alone, and would still love him even if he were ugly. Christian tells this to Cyrano, and then persuades Cyrano to tell Roxane the truth about the letters, saying he has to be loved for \\"the fool that he is\\" to be truly loved at all. Cyrano disbelieves what Christian claims Roxane has said, until she tells him so as well. But, before Cyrano can tell her the truth, Christian is brought back to the camp, having been fatally shot. Cyrano realizes that, in order to preserve Roxane's image of an eloquent Christian, he cannot tell her the truth. The battle ensues, a distraught Roxane collapses and is carried off by de Guiche and Ragueneau, and Cyrano rallies the Cadets to hold back the Spanish until relief arrives. The second-to-last scene. First performance of the play. Published in \\"l'illustration\\", 8 January 1898 Act V ‚Äì Cyrano's Gazette Fifteen years later, at a convent outside Paris. Roxane now resides here, eternally mourning her beloved Christian. She is visited by de Guiche, who is now a good friend and now sees Cyrano as an equal (and has been promoted to duke), Le Bret, and Ragueneau (who has lost his wife and bakery, and is now a candlelighter for Moli√®re), and she expects Cyrano to come by as he always has with news of the outside world. On this day, however, he has been mortally wounded by someone who dropped a huge log on his head from a tall building. Upon arriving to deliver his \\"gazette\\" to Roxane, knowing it will be his last, he asks Roxane if he can read \\"Christian's\\" farewell letter. She gives it to him, and he reads it aloud as it grows dark. Listening to his voice, she realizes that it is Cyrano who was the author of all the letters, but Cyrano denies this to his death. Ragueneau and Le Bret return, telling Roxane of Cyrano's injury. While Cyrano grows delirious, his friends weep and Roxane tells him that she loves him. He combats various foes, half imaginary and half symbolic, conceding that he has lost all but one important thing ‚Äì his panache ‚Äì as he dies in Le Bret and Ragueneau's arms. Stage history Beno√Æt-Constant Coquelin created the role of Cyrano de Bergerac (1897) On 27 December 1897, the curtain rose at the Th√©√¢tre de la Porte Saint-Martin,The Cambridge Guide to Theatre, Cambridge University Press (1995) and the audience was pleasantly surprised. A full hour after the curtain fell, the audience was still applauding. The original Cyrano was Constant Coquelin, who played it over 410 times at said theatre and later toured North America in the role. The original production had sets designed by Marcel Jambon and his associates Brard and Alexandre Bailly (Acts I, III and V), Eug√®ne Carpezat (Act II), and Alfred Lemeunier (Act IV). The earliest touring production of Cyrano was set up by Charles Moncharmont and Maurice Luguet. It was premiered in Monte Carlo on 29 March 1898, and subsequently presented in France, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, Hungary, Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Egypt, Greece, Italy, Algeria, Tunisia and Spain. Special, transportable sets emulating the Parisian production were created for this tour by Albert Dubosq: > La troupe qui interpr√©tera Cyrano de Bergerac se composera de quarante > personnes.

Richard Mansfield was the first actor to play Cyrano in the United States in an English translation. Walter Hampden on the cover of Time in 1929, while he was the producer, director, star and theatre manager of a Broadway revival of Cyrano de Bergerac The longest-running Broadway production ran 232 performances in 1923 and starred Walter Hampden, who returned to the role on the Great White Way in 1926, 1928, 1932, and 1936. Hampden used the 1923 Brian Hooker translation prepared especially for him, which became such a classic in itself that it was used by virtually every English-speaking Cyrano until the mid-1980s. In 1946 Hampden passed the torch to Jos√© Ferrer, who won a Tony Award for playing Cyrano in a much-praised Broadway staging, the highlight of which was a special benefit performance in which Ferrer played the title role for the first four acts and Hampden (then in his mid-sixties) assumed it for the fifth. Ferrer reprised the role on live television in 1949 and 1955, and in a 1950 film version for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor. It became Ferrer's most famous role. Other notable English-speaking Cyranos were Ralph Richardson, DeVeren Bookwalter, Derek Jacobi, Michael Kanarek, Richard Chamberlain, and Christopher Plummer, who played the part in Rostand's original play and won a Tony Award for the 1973 musical adaptation. Kevin Kline played the role in a Broadway production in 2007, with Jennifer Garner playing Roxane and Daniel Sunjata as Christian. A taped version of the production was broadcast on PBS's Great Performances in 2009. In 2018, David Serero is the first French actor to play Cyrano in America in the English language. Later stage versions *1962/1963 Stratford Shakespeare Festival performed the play for two seasons, with John Colicos in the title role. * 1970 Anthony Burgess wrote a new translation and adaptation of Cyrano de Bergerac, which had its world premiere at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis. Paul Hecht was Cyrano. Also in the cast were Len Cariou as Christian, and Roberta Maxwell as Roxane. A later production was the Royal Shakespeare Company's acclaimed 1983 stage production, starring Derek Jacobi as Cyrano and Alice Krige (later Sin√©ad Cusack) as Roxane, which was videotaped and broadcast on television in 1985. For this production, Burgess very significantly reworked his earlier translation; both Burgess translations have appeared in book form. * 1973 A musical adaptation by Anthony Burgess, called Cyrano and starring Christopher Plummer (who won a Tony Award for his performance), appeared in Boston and then on Broadway. Twenty years later, a Dutch musical stage adaptation was translated into English and produced on Broadway as Cyrano: The Musical. Both the 1973 and 1993 versions were critical and commercial failures. In the same year, the Azerbaijani composer Gara Garayev wrote the musical The Furious Gasconian, based on the play. * 1977 A condensed version of Rostand's play, in prose, was written by the Scottish writer Tom Gallacher and performed at the Pitlochry Festival Theatre. * 1982/1983 The Shaw Festival in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, produced the play for two seasons, directed by Derek Goldby and starring Heath Lamberts. * 1983 - 85 Emily Frankel wrote a condensed prose adaptation for her husband John Cullum which was first performed at Syracuse Stage, directed by Arthur Storchin 1983, then at Atlanta's Alliance Theatre in 1984. A national tour in 1985-1986 concluded with a month's stay at Baltimore's Morris Mechanic Theatre. * 1989 Off Broadway the play has been staged several times, including a New York City parks tour starring Frank Muller, produced by the Riverside Shakespeare Company.\\"Review/Theater; Cyrano Opens a Tour of the Parks,\\" New York Times, 6 July 1989. * 1992 John Wells wrote an adaptation called Cyrano, first presented at the Haymarket Theatre in London. * 1992 Edwin Morgan wrote a translation in Scots verse, which was first performed by the Communicado Theatre Company. The National Theatre of Scotland also produced this version in 2018. * 1994 The Stratford Shakespeare Festival presented the play, directed by Derek Goldby and starring Colm Feore. * 1995 Jatinder Verma wrote and directed an adaptation in English, Hindi and Urdu set in 1930s India, starring Naseeruddin Shah. The play opened at the National Theatre, London, in October. * 1997 Pierre Lebeau starred in the Th√©√¢tre du Nouveau Monde's 1996 production. A great success, the January production was reprised in July (without air conditioning). In November, Antony Sher performed the title role in the Lyric Theatre's production directed by partner Gregory Doran. Frank Langella created and directed and performed the title role in a stripped-down version of the play simply titled Cyrano. Cyrano de Bergerac is one of the two plays \\"performed\\" during Ken Ludwig's comedic play, Moon Over Buffalo, the other being Private Lives. * 2004 Barksdale Theatre in Richmond began its 50th Anniversary season with a production of Emily Frankel's Cyrano, starring David Bridgewater. * 2005 A new adaptation written in verse by Barry Kornhauser was produced by The Shakespeare Theatre in Washington, DC, under the direction of Artistic Director Michael Kahn, and went on to become the most highly honored of DC's plays that year, winning multiple Helen Hayes Awards, including \\"Outstanding Play.\\" * 2007 A new translation of the play by Ranjit Bolt opened at Bristol Old Vic in May. Sound & Fury, a Los Angeles-based comedy trio, presented their parody of the play, called Cyranose! in L.A. at Caf√©-Club Fais Do-Do in September 2007. It was also filmed and released on DVD. * 2006 Barry Wyner loosely based his new musical Calvin Berger on Rostand's play. * 2009 The Stratford Shakespeare Festival again performed the play during their 2009 season, with Colm Feore returning in the title role, directed by Donna Feore. This production was unique in that it combined the translation by Anthony Burgess with portions of the original French text, taking advantage of Canadian bilingualism for dramatic effect. * 2011 Another new translation by Michael Hollinger had its premier at the Folger Theatre, Washington, D.C., in April. Directed by Aaron Posner and produced by Janet Griffin, the adaptation is an accessible American translation that is true to the intent and sensibility of the original. * 2012 Roundabout Theatre Company presented a production of Cyrano de Bergerac from 11 October to 25 November with Douglas Hodge in the lead at the American Airlines Theatre for a limited engagement. * 2013 The Hudson Shakespeare Company of New Jersey presented a version directed by Gene Simakowicz as part of their annual Shakespeare in the Parks tour. The version was based on adaptation from Edmund Rostand's original play and starred Jon Ciccareli as Cyrano, Laura Barbiea as Roxane and Matt Hansen as Christian. * 2013 The play was adapted by Glyn Maxwell and performed at Grosvenor Park Open Air Theatre in Chester * 2014 the Sydney Theatre Company presented a version of the play adapted by Andrew Upton with Richard Roxburgh in the lead role, Eryn Jean Norvill as Roxane and Julia Zemiro as Duenna. * 2015 A new and gender-swapped translation was adapted and directed by Professor Doug Zschiegner with Niagara University Theatre titled, CyranA. * 2016 Theatre Latt√© Da premiered a new musical adaptation titled C. at the Ritz Theater in March in Minneapolis.

Adaptations=Films See List of film adaptations of Cyrano de Bergerac * 1925 A silent, hand-tinted French-Italian film version of the play, starring Pierre Magnier * 1945 Love Letters is a screen adaptation by novelist Ayn Rand of the book Pity My Simplicity by Christopher Massie which converted his story into an adaptation of Rostand's play. The heroine, Singleton (played by Jennifer Jones), falls in love with a soldier during World War II, believing him to be the author of certain love letters that had been written for him by another soldier at the front. In this version, the heroine discovers the identity of the true author (played by Joseph Cotten) in time for the protagonists to experience a \\"happy ending.\\" The film, produced by Hal Wallis, was a commercial success and earned four nominations for Academy Awards, including that of Jones for \\"Best Actress of 1945,\\" and was one of the four films which paired Jones and Cotton as romanic leads. (The others were Since You Went Away, 1944, Duel in the Sun, 1946, and Portrait of Jennie, 1948.) The musical score by Victor Young was also nominated for an Oscar, and featured the melody of the hit song \\"Love Letters\\", which has been recorded by numerous artists since 1945, including Rosemary Clooney, Dick Haymes, Nat King Cole, Elvis Presley, Jack Jones, Engelbert Humperdinck, Shelley Fabares, Elton John and Sin√©ad O'Connor. The melody or song has been reused in other films, including the film Blue Velvet (1986), directed by David Lynch.... * 1945 There is also a relatively unknown French-language black-and-white film version made in 1945, starring Claude Dauphin. Posters and film stills give the impression that the set designs and costumes of the 1950 Jos√© Ferrer film may have been modeled on those in the 1945 movie. * 1950 Jos√© Ferrer played the role in the 1950 film, the first film version of the play made in English. The film was made on a low budget, and although it was highly acclaimed, it was a box office disappointment and was nominated for only one Oscar ‚Äì Best Actor ‚Äì which was won by Ferrer. Nevertheless, it has become a film classic. Mala Powers co-starred as Roxane and William Prince played Christian. This is perhaps the most famous film version of the play. Ferrer reprised the role in Cyrano and d'Artagnan, a 1964 film directed by Abel Gance. * 1959 Aru kengo no shogai (Life of an Expert Swordsman) is a samurai film by Hiroshi Inagaki, adapted from Rostand's Cyrano de Bergerac, and starring Toshiro Mifune in the Cyrano role. It was released in the English-language market with the title Samurai Saga. * 1984 Electric Dreams is the story of a personal computer that becomes self-aware, falls in love with a musician, and then wins her for his socially awkward owner. * 1987 film Roxanne, a contemporary comedy version with a happy ending added, starred Steve Martin as C.D. Bales, Daryl Hannah as Roxanne, and Rick Rossovich as Chris. * 1990 French movie adaptation with G√©rard Depardieu in the title role won several awards and was nominated for an Oscar. * 2009 The Ugly Truth is a 2009 American romantic comedy film starring Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler, featuring a scene at a baseball game where Mike (Gerard Butler) advises remotely via radio Abby (Katherine Heigl) in an earpiece, telling her what to say to her date to win him. * 2012 Let It Shine is a Disney Channel Original Movie loosely based on this story. It stars an aspiring teenage musician named Cyrus DeBarge who allows his friend, Kris, to use his music to win over their childhood friend, Roxie, who is a professional singer. * 2014 A Telugu romantic comedy movie, Oohalu Gusagusalade, is an adaptation of the play. * 2018 Sierra Burgess is a Loser is a Netflix original movie, retelling this story through catfishing, texting, and high school social hierarchy. * 2018 #Roxy is a Canadian romantic comedy film and a modern retelling of the play. *2018 The British comedy Old Boys is a school-set re- working of the play where an awkward but imaginative pupil helps the handsome but spectacularly dim school-hero pursue the fiery daughter of a visiting French teacher. *2019 The French film Edmond (distributed in English-speaking countries as Cyrano, My Love) is a fictionalized behind-the-scenes look at the composition and first performance of Cyrano de Bergerac. * 2020 The Half of It is a Netflix original movie, retelling this story through the lens of a queer teenage Chinese-American girl living in a small town in America. Animations * 1985‚Äì1987 Spartakus and the Sun Beneath the Sea is a French animated series created by Nina Wolmark. Episode 3, Season 2, aired on 15 October 1986, entitled briefly \\"Cyrano\\", presents another failed attempt of our protagonists (Arkana, Spartakus, Matt and Rebecca) to restore the lost city of Arkadia, when the power of its sun, Tehra, began to fail. Their giant ship Tehrig lands this time on the planet of Borbotrek, ruled by Lord Cyrano, a great scientist, that is thought to know the secret of Arkadia. He proves to be the sole creator of Borbotrek and its citizens (who only speak in rhyme), through the power of imagination and pushed by the impetus of an idealized love for a mysterious Lady Roxanne. Cyrano would only allow women in his palace, hoping that one of them might be Roxanne, that's why he lets Arkana in, thinking her to be the one, and willing to tell her the \\"secret\\". There is a misunderstanding between the two on that matter, leaving Arkana without the solution to save her city, and Cyrano having to face unrequited love. This causes the cities and the people of his planet to vanish, because of his broken heart. The end of the episode is optimistic though, bringing Cyrano to the realization that he doesn't need to fulfill his love on a material level in order to create life out of imagination, that his inner world and ideals are enough of a motivation in order to see what is \\"real\\" for him. This represents the key to his eternal problem, since the episode ends with the image of Roxanne asking to see Cyrano by the gates of his palace. * 2000 Futurama is an animated series created by Matt Groening. Episode 5, Season 2, aired on February 06, 2000, titled \\"Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?\\". The plot involves the character Zoidberg returning to his homeworld to mate. To gain the affection of his love interest, Edna. His crew mate Fry coaches him on human romance techniques, feeding Zoidberg lines to say, parodying the balcony scene of the play. Zoidberg struggles to understand how this could work but he eventually gets the idea, and, using his new-found techniques, successfully woos Edna to a date. The truth is revealed, and Edna attempts to seduce Fry, leading to a battle to the death between Fry and Zoidberg. The episode ends when it is revealed that Zoidberg accidentally misses his chance to mate, and Edna instead mates with the king. * 2018 Bob's Burgers is an animated series created by Loren Bouchard. Episode 11, Season 8, aired on 25 March 2018, titled \\"Sleeping with the Frenemy\\". It involves the protagonist, Tina, allowing her rival Tammy to stay with her family during Spring Break and fixing her up with a boy from out of town who both girls like, Brett. Tina talks to Brett through Tammy in order to help her win a date. The truth eventually comes out. Tammy recognizes their affinity for one another and convinces Brett to go on a walk with Tina on the beach. The episode closes with Tina and Brett sharing a kiss on the wharf. Radio Kenneth Branagh starred as Cyrano, Jodhi May as Roxanne, and Tom Hiddleston as Christian, in a 2008 BBC Radio 3 production using the Anthony Burgess translation and directed by David Timson. This production first aired on BBC Radio 3 on 23 March 2008 and was re-broadcast on 4 April 2010. Len Cariou and Roberta Maxwell starred in a 1980 CBC Television version directed by Peabody-winner Yuri Rasovsky. Tom Burke and Emily Pithon starred in a 2015 BBC Radio 4 version for 15 Minute Drama, spanning five 15-minute episodes. It was adapted by Glyn Maxwell, and directed by Susan Roberts. Opera An opera in French, Cyrano de Bergerac, whose libretto by Henri Cain is based on Rostand's words, was composed by the Italian Franco Alfano and was first presented in an Italian translation in 1936. In recent years, the original French version has been revived in productions including the Op√©ra national de Montpellier with Roberto Alagna in 2003, and a 2005 Metropolitan Opera production with Pl√°cido Domingo in the title role; both are available in DVD recordings. Victor Herbert's unsuccessful 1899 operetta Cyrano de Bergerac, with a libretto by Harry B. Smith based on the play, was one of Herbert's few failures. Walter Damrosch's Cyrano, another operatic adaptation of Cyrano de Bergerac, premiered in 1913 at the Metropolitan Opera. Eino Tamberg composed another opera titled Cyrano de Bergerac in 1974, to a libretto in Estonian by Jaan Kross, based on Rostand's play. The opera Cyrano by David DiChiera to a libretto by Bernard Uzan premiered at the Michigan Opera Theatre on 13 October 2007. Scientific studies: \\"Cyranoids\\" Inspired by the balcony scene in which Cyrano provides Christian with words to speak to Roxane, Stanley Milgram developed an experimental technique that used covert speech shadowing to construct hybrid personae in social psychological experiments, wherein subjects would interact with a \\"Cyranoid\\" whose words emanated from a remote, unseen \\"source\\".Milgram, S.

Changes to the epigenome can result in changes to the structure of chromatin and changes to the function of the genome. Epigenome The epigenome is involved in regulating gene expression, development, tissue differentiation, and suppression of transposable elements. Unlike the underlying genome, which remains largely static within an individual, the epigenome can be dynamically altered by environmental conditions.  Cancer  Epigenetics is a currently active topic in cancer research. Human tumors undergo a major disruption of DNA methylation and histone modification patterns. The aberrant epigenetic landscape of the cancer cell is characterized by a global genomic hypomethylation, CpG island promoter hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes, an altered histone code for critical genes and a global loss of monoacetylated and trimethylated histone H4.  Epigenome research projects  As a prelude to a potential Human Epigenome Project, the Human Epigenome Pilot Project aims to identify and catalogue Methylation Variable Positions (MVPs) in the human genome. Advances in sequencing technology now allow for assaying genome-wide epigenomic states by multiple molecular methodologies. Micro- and nanoscale devices have been constructed or proposed to investigate the epigenome. An international effort to assay reference epigenomes commenced in 2010 in the form of the International Human Epigenome Consortium (IHEC).\\"BioNews - Human Epigenome project launched\\". IHEC members aim to generate at least 1,000 reference (baseline) human epigenomes from different types of normal and disease-related human cell types.\\"France: Human epigenome consortium takes first steps\\" . 5 March 2010.Eurice GmbH. \\"About IHEC\\". Roadmap epigenomics project One goal of the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Project is to generate human reference epigenomes from normal, healthy individuals across a large variety of cell lines, primary cells and primary tissues. Data produced by the project, which can be browsed and downloaded from the Human Epigenome Atlas, fall into five types that assay different aspects of the epigenome and outcomes of epigenomic states (such as gene expression): # Histone Modifications ‚Äì Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (ChIP-Seq) identifies genome wide patterns of histone modifications using antibodies against the modifications. # DNA Methylation ‚Äì Whole Genome Bisulfite-Seq, Reduced Representation Bisulfite-Seq (RRBS), Methylated DNA Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (MeDIP-Seq), and Methylation-sensitive Restriction Enzyme Sequencing (MRE-Seq) identify DNA methylation across portions of the genome at varying levels of resolution down to basepair level. # Chromatin Accessibility ‚Äì DNase I hypersensitive sites Sequencing (DNase- Seq) uses the DNase I enzyme to find open or accessible regions in the genome. # Gene Expression ‚Äì RNA-Seq and expression arrays identify expression levels or protein coding genes. # Small RNA Expression ‚Äì smRNA-Seq identifies expression of small noncoding RNA, primarily miRNAs. Reference epigenomes for healthy individuals will enable the second goal of the Roadmap Epigenomics Project, which is to examine epigenomic differences that occur in disease states such as Alzheimer's disease.

Grandparents in the United Kingdom have no inherent legal right to see their grandchildren. The association was launched in 1987 by a group of grandparents whose grandchildren had been put into foster care or adopted from foster care, or were not allowed any contact with their grandparents.http://www.wiltshiretimes.co.uk/news/3964484.Grandparents__support_group_launched/ In contrast, a difficult or disrupted grandparent‚Äìparent relationship can threaten proximity of grandparents to grandchildren, contact, involvement and fulfilment of a satisfying grandparental role (Ferguson et al., 2004; Lavers & SonugaBarke, 1997). If (as is usually the case) the children reside with their mother, then paternal grandparents may have to ‚Äòtread carefully‚Äô in obtaining access to their grandchildren; and it can be denied. The consequences of unwanted loss of contact with grandchildren can be devastating. Drew and Smith (2002) sampled grandparents who were members of support groups such as the Grandparents Association; after loss of contact with their grandchildren due to parental divorce, grandparents reported symptoms of bereavement and negative effects on their physical and emotional health (more so than with separation just arising from geographical distance). The hope of reunion with their grandchildren, while not totally unrealistic, makes it difficult to work through the grief process. http://www.thepsychologist.org.uk/archive/archive_home.cfm/volumeID_18-editionID_129-ArticleID_950-getfile_getPDF/thepsychologist%5C1105smit.pdf ReferencesSources *Ferguson, N., Douglas, G., Lowe, N. et al.

He was born at Rendsburg in Holstein, Germany. He was originally intended for the law, but from an early age showed a decided preference for classical studies. In 1658 he went to the Netherlands in the hope of finding work as a teacher of classics, and in the following year, through the influence of JF Gronovius, he obtained the post of tutor and travelling companion to a wealthy young Dutchman, Samuel Schars. During his travels Gude seized the opportunity of copying inscriptions and manuscripts. At the earnest request of his pupil, who had become greatly attached to him, Gude refused more than one professional appointment, and it was not until 1671 that he accepted the post of librarian to Duke Christian Albert of Holstein- Gottorp. Schars, who had accompanied Gude, died in 1675, and left him the greater part of his property. In 1678 Gude, having quarrelled with the duke, retired into private life; but in 1682 he entered the service of Christian V of Denmark as counsellor of the Schleswig-Holstein chancellery, and remained in it almost to the time of his death. Gude's great life-work, the collection of Greek and Latin inscriptions, was not published till 1731. Mention may also be made of his editio princeps (1661) of the treatise of Hippolytus the Martyr on Antichrist, and of his notes on Phaedrus (with four new fables discovered by him) published in Pieter Burmann's edition (1698). His correspondence (ed. P Burmann, 1697) is the most important authority for the events of Gude's life, besides containing valuable information on the learning of the times.

In the fall of 2015, Mannes moved from its previous location on Manhattan's Upper West Side to join the rest of the New School campus in Arnhold Hall at 55 W. 13th Street.  History  Mannes School of Music (2016) Originally called The David Mannes Music School, it was founded in 1916 by David Mannes, concertmaster of the New York Symphony Orchestra, and his wife Clara Damrosch, sister of Walter Damrosch, then conductor of that orchestra and Frank Damrosch. The Damrosch and Mannes families were perhaps the most important music families in America at that time, with David Mannes emerging as one of the first American born violin recitalists to achieve significant status. David Mannes was the director of the Third Street Music School Settlement as well as founder of Colored Music Settlement School, all prior to founding the Mannes School. The School was originally housed on East 70th Street (later occupied by the Dalcroze School), a larger campus was created out of three brownstones on East 74th Street, in Manhattan's Upper East Side. After 1938, the school was known as the Mannes Music School, in recognition of the broader course of study that expanded the school well beyond that of a community music school, including the three-year Artist Diploma. When Clara died in 1948, their son Leopold Mannes became president, endowing the school with his fortune from co-inventing Kodachrome film. In 1953 the school began offering a bachelor of science degree and changed its name to the Mannes College of Music. In 1960 it merged with the Chatham Square Music School. In 1984 the school moved to larger quarters on West 85th Street. In 1989 Mannes joined The New School, whose five schools include Parsons School of Design, Eugene Lang College, and School of Drama. In 2005, the New School administration changed the name to Mannes College: the New School for Music. In 2015, the university renamed it Mannes School of Music, and moved it to Arnhold Hall in the West Village. It is now part of the College of Performing Arts at The New School, which also includes the School of Drama and the School of Jazz and Contemporary Music. The College of Performing Arts, including Mannes Prep, has a total of 1,450 students. The students in any of the three schools of the College of Performing Arts can take courses in the three schools (Drama, Jazz, Mannes), no matter which school they are directly enrolled in, expanding the opportunities for self- directed study.  Academics  Two academic divisions constitute the conservatory: * College: the academic spine of the school, conferring undergraduate and graduate degrees and diplomas * Preparatory: pre-college training for children and adolescents The Techniques of Music program is the foundation for academic musical study in the two divisions at Mannes, encompassing the range of elementary to advanced music theory and aural skills and analysis classes. Music theory was taught at Mannes from its inception, with David Mannes hiring important figures such as Ernest Bloch and Rosario Scalero to teach theory and composition. in 1931 Hans Weisse was hired, one of the leading students of Heinrich Schenker.Historical information is derived from annual Mannes catalogs. Over the following nine years, Weisse promoted not just the study of Schenkerian analysis but the incorporation of it into the musical life of the school, including performance and composition. Because of his association with the school, Schenker's publication Five Graphic Music Analyses (F√ºnf Urlinie-Tafeln) was published jointly by his regular publisher, Universal Edition and the David Mannes School in 1932.As indicated on the cover of the publication's first edition. In 1940, Weisse died unexpectedly and was replaced by Felix Salzer. Salzer, also a student of Schenker, built upon Weisse's foundation by reorganizing the theory program into the Techniques of Music department. The philosophy behind this move was and is to integrate musicianship, theory, and performance, which was based on Schenker's concept of the role of theory in tonal music.See David Carson Berry, \\"Hans Weisse and the Dawn of American Schenkerism,\\" Journal of Musicology 20, no. 1 (Winter 2003): 104‚Äì156. Salzer's leading student, Carl Schachter, as well as his students, continued and strengthened the department. Today the Mannes program is rapidly evolving and expanding in both the study of performance and theory. Mannes has revised its curriculum to include the incorporation of music technology classes, improvisation ensembles, teaching artistry, arts journalism, film music composition, creative entrepreneurship and more, all tied to a new commitment to contemporary music well beyond the tonal-based approach of Schenker. The Mannes of today includes an ever-increasing number of programs in partnership with its sister conservatory, School of Jazz.

In all cases, Congress or the President acted against the most clearly defined legal course of action at the time, although in no case were the actions illegal. Two cases involved the resolution of indeterminate or disputed electoral votes from the United States presidential election process, and the third involved the disputed use of a presidential pardon. In all three cases, the president so elevated served a single term, or singular vacancy, and either did not run again or was not reelected when he ran. In the 1824 election, without an absolute majority in the Electoral College, the 12th Amendment dictated that the Presidential election be sent to the House of Representatives, whose Speaker and candidate in his own right, Henry Clay, gave his support to John Quincy Adams and was then selected to be his Secretary of State. In the 1876 election, accusations of corruption stemmed from officials involved in counting the necessary and hotly contested electoral votes of both sides, in which Rutherford B. Hayes was elected by a congressional commission. Election of 1824 Votes in the Electoral College, 1824 The voting by state in the House of Representatives, 1825. Note that all of Clay's states voted for Adams. After the votes were counted in the U.S. presidential election of 1824, no candidate had received the majority needed of the Presidential Electoral votes (although Andrew Jackson had the mosthttps://www.270towin.com/1824_Election/), thereby putting the outcome in the hands of the House of Representatives. There were four candidates on the ballot: John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay, Andrew Jackson, and William H. Crawford. Following the provisions of the Twelfth Amendment, however, only the top three candidates in the electoral vote were admitted as candidates, eliminating Henry Clay. To the surprise of many, the House elected John Quincy Adams over rival Andrew Jackson. It was widely believed that Clay, the Speaker of the House, convinced Congress to elect Adams, who then made Clay his Secretary of State. Jackson's supporters denounced this as a \\"corrupt bargain.\\"\\"The Election of 1824 Was Decided in the House of Representatives: The Controversial Election was Denounced as 'The Corrupt Bargain'\\", Robert McNamara, About.com The \\"corrupt bargain\\" that placed Adams in the White House and Clay in the State Department launched a four-year campaign of revenge by the friends of Andrew Jackson. Claiming that the people had been cheated of their choice, Jacksonians attacked the Adams administration at every turn as illegitimate and tainted by aristocracy and corruption. Adams aided his own defeat by failing to rein in the pork barrel frenzy sparked by the General Survey Act. Jackson's attack on the national blueprint put forward by Adams and Clay won support from Old Republicans and market liberals, the latter of which increasingly argued that Congressional involvement in internal improvements was an open invitation to special interests and political logrolling.Book review of John Lauritz Larson's Internal Improvement: National Public Works and the Promise of Popular Government in the Early United States A 1998 analysis using game theory mathematics argued that contrary to the assertions of Jackson, his supporters, and countless later historians, the results of the election were consistent with so-called \\"sincere voting\\", that is, those Members of the House of Representatives who were unable to cast votes for their most-favored candidate apparently voted for their second- (or third-) most-favored candidate. Regardless of the various theories concerning the matter, Adams was a one-term President; his rival, Jackson, was elected President by a large majority of the electors in the election of 1828 and then a second term in the election of 1832. Election of 1876 The presidential election of 1876 is sometimes considered to be a second \\"corrupt bargain.\\"\\"Election 2000 much like Election 1876\\" , Wes Allison, St. Petersburg Times, November 17, 2000. Three Southern states had contested vote counts, and each sent the results of two different slates of electors. Since both candidates needed those electoral votes to win the election, Congress appointed a special Electoral Commission to settle the dispute over which slates of electors to accept. After the Compromise of 1877, the commission awarded all the disputed electoral votes to the Republican candidate, Rutherford B. Hayes, and Congress voted to accept their report. Some of the points in the compromise are said to have already been the established position of Hayes from the time of his accepting the Republican nomination. Hayes's detractors labeled the alleged compromise a \\"Corrupt Bargain\\" and mocked him with the nickname \\"Rutherfraud.\\"\\"A pill too bitter to swallow\\", guardian.co.uk, Sunday November 12, 2000. The most often cited item in the \\"compromise\\" was the agreement to accept Southern \\"home rule\\" by withdrawing the remaining Northern troops from Southern capitals. That would remove an important tool the federal government had used to force the South to uphold the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, which were intended to protect the rights of African-Americans, particularly their right to vote. Generally, political support for maintaining the troops had dissipated during Grant's second term, and Hayes had little choice but to accept some form of \\"home rule.\\" He attempted to do so, as stated in his nomination acceptance letter, by gaining promises from Southern states that they would respect the rights, and especially the voting rights, of the freedmen. On the other political side, the Democratic platform of Samuel Tilden, also promised removal of troops, but with no mention of any attempts to guarantee the freedmen's rights. For a time, Hayes's approach had some success, but gradually Southern states moved to build new barriers to black suffrage and flourishing‚Äîbarriers which would hold legally for almost an entire century. 1974 pardon of Nixon Gerald Ford's 1974 pardon of Richard Nixon was described as a \\"corrupt bargain\\" by critics of the disgraced former president. The critics claimed that Ford's pardon was quid pro quo for Nixon's resignation, which elevated Ford to the presidency. The most public critic was US Representative Elizabeth Holtzman, who, as the lowest-ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, was the only representative who explicitly asked whether the pardon was a quid pro quo.

He was a younger brother, and later the biographer, of writer A. J. A. Symons. He left school at 14. He founded the poetry magazine Twentieth Century Verse in 1937, editing it for two years. \\"He turned to crime writing in a light‚Äìhearted way before the war and soon afterwards established himself as a leading exponent of it, though his use of irony to show the violence behind the respectable masks of society place many of his books on the level of the orthodox novel.\\"The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, Penguin Books, 1985; . Introduction. As an early Trotskyist, he applied for recognition as an anti-capitalist conscientious objector in World War II, but was refused by his tribunal. He chose not to appeal, and ended up in the Royal Armoured Corps 1942 to 1944, when he was invalided out with a non-battle-related arm injury. After a period as an advertising copywriter, he became a full-time writer in 1947. During his career he won two Edgar Awards from the Mystery Writers of America and, in 1982, received the MWA's Grand Master Award. Symons served as the president of the Detection Club from 1976 till 1985. Symons's 1972 book Bloody Murder: From the Detective Story to the Crime Novel (published as Mortal Consequences in the US) is one of the best-known critical works in the field of crime fiction. Revised editions were published in 1985, 1992 and finally in 1994. Symons highlighted the distinction between the classic puzzler mystery, associated with such writers as Agatha Christie and John Dickson Carr, and the more modern \\"crime novel,\\" which puts emphasis on psychology and motivation. Symons published over thirty crime novels and story collections between 1945 and 1994. His works combined elements of both the detective story and the crime novel, but leaned clearly toward the latter, with an emphasis on character and psychology which anticipated later crime fiction writers such as Ruth Rendell and P.D. James. His novels tend to focus on ordinary people drawn into a murderous chain of events; the intricate plots are often spiced with black humour. Novels typical of his style include The Colour of Murder (1957), the Edgar-winning The Progress of a Crime (1960), The Man Whose Dreams Came True (1968) The Man Who Lost His Wife (1970) and The Plot Against Roger Ryder (1973). Symons wrote two modern-day Sherlock Holmes pastiches, as well as a pastiche set in the 1920s. In A Three Pipe Problem (1975), the detective was \\"...a television actor, Sheridan Hayes, who wears the mask of Sherlock Holmes and assumes his character. The book neatly reversed the usual theme of the criminal behind the mask by having a rather commonplace man wearing the mask of the great detective.\\" The Kentish Manor Murders was written in 1988. For his 1981 book The Great Detectives, he wrote a Sherlock Holmes pastiche instead of a biographical sketch. Entitled \\"How a Hermit was Disturbed in His Retirement,\\" the events of the tale take place in the 1920s as Sherlock Holmes is drawn out of retirement to solve an unusual missing persons case. The story was included in the collection The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, in which it was given the more Doylean title of \\"The Adventure of Hillerman Hall.\\" He also made occasional forays into historical mystery, such as The Blackheath Poisonings (1978), which was filmed for television in 1992.

It has 151 collegiate chapters in the United States and Canada and more than 200 alumnae groups.https://www.deltagamma.org/ourstory/dgataglance The organization's executive office is in Columbus, Ohio. Delta Gamma is one of 26 national fraternities under the umbrella organization of the National Panhellenic Conference.  History  Delta Gamma was founded in December 1873 at the Lewis School for Girls in Oxford, Mississippi near the University of Mississippi. The group's founders were Mary Comfort Leonard, Eva Webb Dodd, and Anna Boyd Ellington. The early growth for Delta Gamma was confined to women's colleges in the southern United States. Within a few years, Delta Gamma had established itself in the northern United States and later to the East with the help of George Banta, a member of Phi Delta Theta fraternity and Delta Gamma's only male initiate. Banta played an integral part in the expansion of Delta Gamma chapters from Oxford, Mississippi, to well-recognized northern colleges. In 1882, Banta married Lillian Vawter, a Delta Gamma at Franklin College. After Lillian died in 1885, he was remarried to Ellen Lee Pleasants. In his later years, he assisted with the rewriting of the Delta Gamma ritual. He frequently visited Delta Gamma conventions, often participating as a guest speaker. He appeared for his last speech in 1934, a year before his death. As a result of the assistance provided by Banta, Delta Gamma retains close historical ties with the Phi Delta Theta fraternity.https://www.phideltatheta.org/2009/03/millers-meanderings-how- george-banta-sr-became-an-initiated-member-of-delta-gamma-sorority/ Delta Gamma was one of seven charter members of the National Panhellenic Conference when the first inter-sorority meeting was held in Boston, Massachusetts in 1891.https://npcwomen.dynamic.omegafi.com/wp- content/uploads/sites/2037/2017/10/Adventure-in-Friendship-2017-Web.pdf Delta Gamma and the six other charter members formally joined the National Panhellenic Conference in 1902.  Delta Gamma Foundation and modern day  The Delta Gamma Foundation was formed in 1951 . The Delta Gamma Foundation gives more than 150,000 volunteer service hours and raises hundreds of thousands of dollars annually for scholarships and grants for its members, schools and assistance for the visually impaired, and support for U.S. veterans. Today, Delta Gamma has 151 collegiate chapters in the United States and Canada. It has more than 200 alumnae groups in the United States, Canada and England. In 2013, Delta Gamma founded the #IAmASororityWoman campaign. This movement calls on members of any sorority to spark meaningful conversations about what sorority women truly value, in an effort to combat common stereotypes.  Symbols  Although Delta Gamma has no official jewel, the fraternity recognizes the anchor as its official symbol and bronze, pink, and blue as its official colors. The official flower is the cream-colored rose, which is registered as the Delta Gamma Cream Rose with the American Rose Society and is the only official sorority flower to have been registered as such. The Hannah Doll is their mascot. The badge of Delta Gamma is a golden anchor and may be worn only by initiated members. Before the adoption of the golden anchor, the symbol of Delta Gamma was simply a \\"H\\" for the word \\"Hope\\". In 1877, the original \\"Hope\\" badge was changed to the traditional symbol of hope, the anchor. Today's badge has a small cable wrapping around the top of the anchor, with the Greek letters Tau Delta Eta (Œ§ŒîŒó) on the crosspiece. Delta Gamma's motto is \\"Do Good.\\"  Programs = Philanthropy  The Delta Gamma Foundation has three main philanthropic focuses: Service for Sight, grants to the fraternity for educational and leadership purposes, and grants to individual members. Members contribute to its funds, which go into Service for Sight, scholarships, fellowships, loans, leadership and educational programming, and assistance to members in crisis. Delta Gamma gives more than 150,000 volunteer hours to Service for Sight each year. The sorority is one of the first recipients of the Helen Keller Philanthropic Service Award, given by the American Foundation for the Blind for assistance to those who are visually impaired and for sight conservation, and it is the first recipient of the Virginia Boyce Award presented by Prevent Blindness AmericaDelta Gamma sorority house at Ohio University = Anchor Splash and Anchor Games = Anchor Splash and Anchor Games are the sorority's fundraising events hosted on college campuses across North America. The proceeds raised at these events support Delta Gamma's philanthropies. Each chapter decides how to implement these events on their campus; for example, some chapters may host flag football tournaments or volleyball tournaments as their fundraiser.  Anchora  The official Delta Gamma magazine is the Anchora (\\"aNGk…ôr…ô\\" not \\"ank√¥r…ô\\"), which has been published continuously since 1884. The Anchora also serves as an archival resource of member activities. The Anchora is published quarterly every year and has been ever since 1884. Delta Gamma members can be featured in the magazine by submitting photos or other information that they would like to be written in The Anchora.

Stewart Macalister (ed. & trans.), Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn: The Book of the Taking of Ireland Part V, Irish Texts Society, 1956, p. 261 The chronology of Geoffrey Keating's Foras Feasa ar √âirinn dates his reign to 537-530 BC,Geoffrey Keating, Foras Feasa ar √âirinn 1.27 that of the Annals of the Four Masters to 738-731 BC.Annals of the Four Masters M4462-4469 Keating refers to a story that Lugaid, when hunting, once met a hideous hag wearing a magic mask. When he slept with her he took off her mask, and dreamed that she became a beautiful young woman. Keating interprets this as an allegory of Ireland, meaning that Lugaid first endured toil and torment, and then enjoyed pleasure, over her. He also tells a story from the C√≥ir Anmann (\\"fitness of names\\") about a certain Lugaid Lo√≠gde, one of the five sons of D√°ire Doimthech, all of whom were called Lugaidh. A druid prophesied to D√°ire that one of his sons would rule Ireland. When D√°ire asked which one, he was told to take all five to Tailtiu and pursue a beautiful fawn which would appear to them there, and the one who outran it would be king. They chased it from Tailtiu to Howth, where a magical mist obscured all five from the men of Ireland. The son who caught and killed the fawn was Lugaidh Laighdhe. However, as this Lugaidh has a different father, Keating does not believe he is the same man.

The River Rouge is a 127-mile (204 kilometer)U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed November 7, 2011 river in the Metro Detroit area of southeastern Michigan. It flows into the Detroit River at Zug Island, which is the boundary between the cities of River Rouge and Detroit. The river's roughly watershed includes all or parts of 48 municipalities, with a total population of more than 1.35 million, and it drains a large portion of central and northwest Wayne County, as well as much of southern Oakland County and a small area in eastern Washtenaw County. Nearly the entire drainage basin is in urban and suburban areas, with areas of intensive residential and industrial development. Still, more than of the River Rouge flow through public lands, making it one of the most accessible rivers in the state. Until recently the river was heavily polluted, and in 1969 oil on the surface caught fire. The passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972 made it unlawful to discharge any pollution from a point source into navigable waters, and the EPA's National Pollution Discharge Elimination Program was created to regulate these discharges. In 1986, a non- profit organization of concerned citizens called Friends of the Rouge was formed and began organizing an annual cleanup called Rouge Rescue, to raise awareness about the need to clean up the Rouge. In 1987, the entire watershed was designated a Great Lakes Area of Concern under the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. Nine Beneficial Use Impairments were identified. In 1992, a massive project called the Rouge River National Wet Weather Demonstration Project was implemented, and further cleanup measures are ongoing. The Alliance of Rouge Communities is an organization of governmental and non- governmental entities created in 2006 to manage the watershed. Physical and natural aspects The River Rouge totals in length and is divided into four branches, the main, upper, middle, and lower branches. The upper branch flows into the main branch in northwest Detroit, just east of Redford Township. The middle branch enters the main branch in Dearborn Heights just north of the boundary with Dearborn. The lower branch joins less than two miles (3 km) downstream in Dearborn. The lower of the river south of Michigan Avenue were channelized, widened, and dredged to allow freighter access to Ford's River Rouge Plant inland factory facilities. The plant was built between 1915 and 1927. It was the first manufacturing facility for automobiles that included within the plant virtually everything needed to produce the cars: blast furnaces, an open hearth mill, a steel rolling mill, a glass plant, a huge power plant, and an assembly line. During the 1930s, some 100,000 workers were employed here. The plant has been designated as a National Historic Landmark. Main branch The headwaters of the main branch rise in the southwest corner of Rochester Hills and the northeast corner of Bloomfield Township. It flows mostly south through the western part of Troy, and then flows southwest through Birmingham, a noncontiguous portion of Bloomfield Township, Beverly Hills, the southeast corner of Bingham Farms, and Southfield. It then flows mostly south through western Detroit and Dearborn Heights, then turns southeast in Dearborn and continues along the northern edges of Allen Park, Melvindale, River Rouge and the southern edge of Detroit. Other municipalities that are part of the main branch watershed are Auburn Hills, Bloomfield Hills, Farmington, Farmington Hills, Franklin, Lathrup Village, Oak Park, Orchard Lake, Pontiac, Southfield Township, and West Bloomfield Township.

From Northville, the middle branch flows south through Northville Township and Plymouth Township before turning to the southeast in the city of Plymouth. From Plymouth, it continues through the southwest corner of Livonia into Westland, then along the northern edge of Garden City and into Dearborn Heights where it merges with the main branch near the southern boundary with Dearborn.

There are 43 AOCs in the Great Lakes Basin total, with the rest in Canada or shared by the two countries.  River Rouge as an AOC  Over 50% of the land surrounding the River Rouge is used for residential, industrial, and commercial purposes and development pressure continues to increase. Consequently, the river is highly polluted and was designated as a Great Lakes Area of Concern under the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement in 1987. The designated AOC covers the entire River Rouge watershed including 48 communities that drain 466 square miles of southeastern Michigan into the Detroit River.Aquatic Nuisance Control & Remedial Action Unit, Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (2008). \\"The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality Biennial Remedial Action Plan for the Rouge River Area of Concern\\" Department of Environmental Equality. Sources of pollution include municipal and industrial discharges, sewer overflows, and several nonpoint source pollution (e.g., storm water runoff). These activities contaminated river sediments and water with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), heavy metals (e.g., mercury), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), oil and grease. These contaminants are known to be harmful to fish and wildlife and affect recreational activities. A 2008 remedial action plan for the AOC identified nine ‚Äúbeneficial use impairments‚Äù associated with the pollution: * Restrictions on fish and wildlife consumption, due to harmful PCBs, PAHs, and heavy metals in sediments and water. *Eutrophication or undesirable algae, resulting from excessive nutrient runoff (particularly phosphorus) from industrial and agricultural activities. * Degradation on fish and wildlife populations * Beach closings, due to potential human health effects from body contact with the water * Fish tumors or other deformities, that can be caused by chemical contaminants * Degradation of aesthetics * Degradation of benthos, which form the base of aquatic food webs * Restriction on dredging activities * Loss of fish and wildlife habitat Parks and recreation=Eliza Howell Park The Eliza Howell Park includes donated to the city in 1936.

Lake Victoria and other bodies of water are shaded blue. Tooro is a Bantu kingdom located within the borders of Uganda. The current Omukama of Toro is King Oyo Nyimba Kabamba Iguru Rukidi IV. King Oyo Nyimba Kabamba Iguru Rukidi IV took to the throne of Tooro kingdom in 1995 at the age of just three years, after the death of his father Omukama Patrick David Matthew Kaboyo Rwamuhokya Olimi III on August 26, 1995, at the age of 50. The people native to the kingdom are the Batooro, and their language is likewise called Rutooro. The Batoro and Banyoro speak closely related languages, Lutoro and Lunyoro, and share many other similar cultural traits. The Batoro live on Uganda's western border, south of Lake Albert.  History  The Tooro Kingdom evolved out of a breakaway segment of Bunyoro sometime before the nineteenth century. It was founded in 1830 when Omukama Kaboyo Olimi I, the eldest son of Omukama of Bunyoro Nyamutukura Kyebambe III of Bunyoro, seceded and established his own independent kingdom. Absorbed into Bunyoro-Kitara in 1876, it reasserted its independence in 1891. As with Buganda, Bunyoro, and Busoga, Tooro's monarchy was abolished in 1967 by the Government of Uganda, but was reinstated in 1993.  Cultural influence  The Austrian painter Friedensreich Hundertwasser (1928‚Äì2000) spent some time there in the 1960s where he painted a number of works and named them after the kingdom.https://hundertwasser.com/malerei/664_one_toro_in_the_kingdom_of_the_mountains_of_the_moon_582http://www.artnet.de/k%C3%BCnstler/friedensreich- hundertwasser/kingdom-of-the-toro-whJKzg5Y-STsW60_az42Fg2. The Batoro people have a strong culture but similar in stratification to Bunyoro. They have got a strong cultural naming system (PET NAME) known as Empaako. With the Empaako naming system, children are given one of twelve names shared across the communities in addition to their given and family names. Addressing someone by his or her Empaako is a positive affirmation of cultural ties. It can be used as a form of greeting or a declaration of affection, respect, honour or love. Use of Empaako can defuse tension or anger and sends a strong message about social identity and unity, peace and reconciliation. The Empaako names are: AMOOTI, ABBOOKI, AKIIKI, ATEENYI, ADYERI, ATWOKI, ABWOLI, ARAALI, ARAALI, ACAALI, BBALA and OKAALI. The use of Empaako can defuse tension or anger and sends a strong message about social identity, unity, peace and reconciliation.

It was designed by the Ottoman imperial architect Mimar Sinan and completed in around 1563. History The R√ºstem Pasha Islamic cultural center was designed by Ottoman imperial architect Mimar Sinan for the grand vizier R√ºstem Pasha (the husband of one of the daughters of Suleiman the Magnificent by Hurrem Sultan, Mihrimah Sultan). R√ºstem Pasha died at age 61 in July 1561 and the mosque was built after his death from around 1561 until 1563. The mosque complex now hosts a religious school.R√ºstem Pasha Mosque Architecture=Exterior The mosque was built on a high terrace over a complex of vaulted shops, whose rents were intended to financially support the mosque complex. Narrow, twisting interior flights of steps in the corners give access to a spacious courtyard. The mosque has a double porch with five domed bays, from which projects a deep and low roof supported by a row of columns.Freely, Blue Guide Istanbul Interior The R√ºstem Pasha Mosque is famous for its large quantities of ƒ∞znik tiles, set in a very wide variety of floral and geometric designs, which cover not only the fa√ßade of the porch but also the mihrab, minbar and walls. There are around 80 different patterns. These tiles exhibit the early use of Armenian bole, a tomato-red pigment that would become characteristic of ƒ∞znik pottery. The bright emerald green colour is only used in a panel added above an exterior doorway at a later date. Some of the tiles, particularly those in a large panel under the portico to the left main entrance, are decorated with sage green and dark manganese purple that are characteristic of the earlier 'Damascus ware' coloring scheme. No other mosque makes such a lavish use of Iznik tiles; with later mosques Sinan used files more sparingly. The plan of the building is basically that of an octagon inscribed in a rectangle. The main dome rests on four semi-domes; not on the axes but in the diagonals of the building. The arches of the dome spring from four octagonal pillars‚Äî two on the north, two on the south‚Äî and from piers projecting from the east and west walls. To the north and south are galleries supported by pillars and by small marble columns between them. Gallery File:DSC04137a Istanbul - R√ºstem Pasha camii - Foto G.

Delta Zeta has 170 collegiate chapters in the United States and Canada, and over 200 alumnae chapters in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States. As of 2013, there are over 244,400 college and alumnae members, making them the third largest sorority in the nation (after Alpha Delta Pi and Chi Omega). In 1954, the sorority adopted speech and hearing as its philanthropic cause, and is partnered with the Starkey Hearing Foundation and Gallaudet University. Throughout its history, it has absorbed several other smaller sororities and also opened its first Canadian chapter in 1992. Delta Zeta is one of 26 national sororities which are members under the umbrella organization of the National Panhellenic Conference; the sorority joined the Conference in 1910.  History  Two students dance outside the Delta Zeta house at the University of Texas at Arlington, 1978 Delta Zeta Sorority was founded at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio in 1902, the same year that the university first allowed female students. Miami is dubbed the \\"Mother of Fraternities\\" because of the many prominent men's fraternities which were founded there. Six of the newly admitted women consulted university president Dr. Guy Potter Benton regarding the founding of the first sorority chapter. Having been a leader in the Phi Delta Theta fraternity, he was familiar with the processes of a Greek organization and helped the women establish the first Delta Zeta chapter, the first sorority at the campus. Benton aided in preparation of the ritual, badge, and colors. For his contributions, he was named the 'Grand Patron'. The Delta Zeta Sorority was officially incorporated in October 24, 1902. The founding members were: Alfa Lloyd Hayes, Mary Jane Collins, Anna Louise Keen, Julia Lawrence Bishop, Mabelle May Minton, and Anne Dial Simmons. The women were harassed for wanting to form a sorority. In one account, someone stole the constitution out of the secretary's hand but Dr. Benton pursued the offender and retrieved the constitution. The first National Assembly, with Lloyd as the national president, was held in 1907. In 1910, Delta Zeta published the first issue of its national magazine, The LAMP, now issued three times a year. That same year, the sorority joined the National Panhellenic Conference. Throughout the middle of the century, Delta Zeta absorbed four other sororities: Beta Phi Alpha in 1941, Phi Omega Pi in 1946, Delta Sigma Epsilon in 1956, and Theta Upsilon in 1962; most of these sororities had previously absorbed other, smaller sororities as well.The Spring 1995 edition of The Lamp of Delta Zeta, p.10, has an article about the sorority's several mergers. Accessed 25 Aug 2020. In 1992, Delta Zeta chartered its first Canadian chapter at the University of Windsor, marking the beginning of the sorority's national expansion. Delta Zeta marked its Centennial Celebration in 2002.  Symbols  Delta Zeta's official flower is the pink Killarney rose, while the official stone is the diamond. The turtle is the official mascot. The Roman lamp is the official symbol. The badge consists of a lamp on top of a winged Ionic column, all in gold, with a diamond set at the spout of the lamp and four pearls inset on the capital of the column. The Greek letters are inscribed on the lamp. At its inception, the original badge did not include pearls, which were added a few years later. The sorority's official colors are rose and green. The 1905 Baird's Manual lists the colors as \\"old rose and nile green\\" which some chapter websites used as of 2018. The 1991 edition says \\"old rose and green\\". However, the official national web site lists the colors as \\"rose and green\\". Delta Zeta is one of the first sororities to have had a Lilly Pulitzer print made with its symbols.  Philanthropy  Since 1954, the national philanthropy of Delta Zeta is speech and hearing. Part of the Delta Zeta creed states, \\"To those whom my life may touch in slight measure, may I give graciously of what is mine,\\" in recognition of the importance of service. Delta Zeta has national partnerships with the Starkey Hearing Foundation and Gallaudet University. The sorority implements a \\"Heart For Hearing\\" to raise money for the foundation. Individual chapters may also support local organizations in their area. In addition, Delta Zeta supports The Painted Turtle Camp as a national service project. This camp supports children with chronic and life-threatening illnesses. Delta Zeta is committed to supporting the camp financially through donations, as well as with their time through volunteering in the camp itself.  The Delta Zeta Foundation  The Delta Zeta Foundation is a not-for-profit entity within the organization that provides various scholarships for members of the sorority as well as funding leadership, philanthropy and education programs. There is a national philanthropic organization for active members of Delta Zeta known as the 1902 Loyalty Society, and members join by donating $19.02.

Delta Zeta has 170 collegiate chapters in the United States and Canada and over 200 alumnae chapters in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States.  Controversies  At the end of 2006, the Delta Chapter of Delta Zeta at DePauw University became enmeshed in a controversy that would eventually make national headlines and result in the chapter's closure. The Delta Zeta national leadership was criticized after the New York Times published an article accusing the National office of moving certain members of the Delta Chapter at DePauw University to alumnae status based on their perceived attractiveness. Founded in 1909, the Delta chapter was the sorority's second oldest active chapter and its fourth oldest chapter overall (a \\"single letter\\" chapter). Despite its long history at DePauw, the Delta Zeta chapter struggled with declining membership and had acquired a negative reputation on campus. As a result, the Delta chapter members voted to request Delta Zeta Sorority to close the chapter due to falling numbers and lack of interest in recruitment. When notified of the chapter decision, Delta Zeta Sorority arranged a chapter membership review and chapter reorganization rather than close the chapter completely. Several of the members that were moved to alumnae status (and therefore required to move out of the Delta Zeta house at DePauw) argued that they were moved to alumnae status due to their perceived unattractiveness, weight, or ethnicity and contacted the media.

He is one of the best known writers on the Perennial philosophy in the Portuguese language. His most recent book in English is Men of a Single Book: Fundamentalism in Islam, Christianity, and Modern Thought (United States, World Wisdom, 2010), which won in the \\"Comparative Religion\\" category of The USA \\"Best Books 2011\\" Awards. He has translated into Portuguese, from the original French, several of the books of the perennialist master Frithjof Schuon (1907‚Äì1998).  Biography  Soares de Azevedo was born in Belo Horizonte, the capital city of Minas Gerais state, to a family with roots in the historical city of Ouro Preto, where he lived his childhood. His family ancestors include Bernardo Pereira de Vasconcelos, Minister of Justice and of Finance in the Brazilian Empire, and governor of the province of Minas Gerais, and Diogo de Vasconcelos, renowned historian and politician, author of Hist√≥ria M√©dia de Minas Gerais. In S√£o Paulo, he attended gymnasium and high school at Col√©gio Santa Cruz, of French Canadian priests, and graduated in Literature and Journalism at the University of S√£o Paulo (USP). He has a graduate degree in international relations from George Washington University and holds a master's degree in History of religions from the University of S√£o Paulo, with a thesis on the contemporary relevance of the Perennial Philosophy. He is the author of seven books on the philosophical and mystical dimensions of Christianity and Islam, and about one hundred articles and essays dealing with the Perennial Philosophy and traditional spirituality in the contemporary world, several of them translated into English, French, and Spanish. His most recent book in English is Men of a Single Book: Fundamentalism in Islam, Christianity, and Modern Thought (United States, World Wisdom, 2010), a critique both of religious and anti-religious fundamentalism; the later represented especially by polemicists such as Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens. This book is the winner in the \\"Comparative Religion\\" category of The USA \\"Best Books 2011\\" Awards. It is also the ForeWord Book of the Year Award Finalist for \\"Religion\\", and Midwest Book Award Silver Medal for \\"Current Events\\". In Portuguese, his latest work is O Livro dos Mestres (The Book of Masters. S√£o Paulo: Ibrasa, 2016), which is composed of outlines of the messages of around twenty spiritual masters of recent times, from diverse religious traditions. Another relatively recent book by Soares de Azevedo is Occultism and Religion in Freud, Jung, and Mircea Eliade, co-authored with the Australian author and professor Harry Oldmeadow.Published in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, by Ibrasa, 2011. He lived a year in London, England, in the 1980s, where he experienced the intellectual impact of the work of French metaphysician Ren√© Gu√©non, which expounds a profound critique of modern materialism and relativism from a purely metaphysical perspective. In the 1990s, he lived a season in Washington, DC, and studied under William Stoddart, Rama Coomaraswamy, and Seyyed Hossein Nasr. There he deepened the study of the Perennial Philosophy and experienced the spiritual impact of the teachings of the German metaphysician and esoterist Frithjof Schuon. For Azevedo,See in this respect his \\"Men of a Single Book\\" (World Wisdom Books, 2010), especially the introduction and chapter one. the Perennial Philosophy casts a unique and contemporary light on the spiritual heritage of the peoples and updates the message of the traditional religions, especially Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism, giving to twenty-first century man a practical alternative to modern skepticism and intellectual confusion. It is noteworthy to grasp that the precursors of the Perennial Philosophy are sapiential masters such as Plato, Pythagoras, Shankara, and Meister Eckhart, and that the foundations of this school of thought are in pure Metaphysics, or in the \\"nature of things\\", not in one of the great Revelations, notwithstanding the fact that the Perennial Philosophy prescribes the need for personal attachment to one of the orthodox religious forms. Azevedo absorbed elements both from Gu√©non and Schuon, as well as from William Stoddart, in his works, such as Men of a Single Book and Iniciaci√≥n al Islam y al Sufism.\\"Iniciaci√≥n al Islam y al Sufism\\", Barcelona, 2004. He is the editor of two anthologies published in the United States. The first is Ye Shall Know The Truth: Christianity And The Perennial Philosophy,Ye Shall Know The Truth: Christianity and The Perennial Philosophy catalog information at the publisher's website. featuring works by Frithjof Schuon, Ren√© Gu√©non, Titus Burckhardt and other perennialists.

She was built by John Randall & Co of Rotherhithe and launched on the Thames on 3 March 1798. Ajax participated in the Egyptian operation of 1801, the Battle of Cape Finisterre in 1805 and the Battle of Trafalgar, before she was lost to a disastrous fire in 1807 during the Dardanelles Operation. Egypt Captain James Whitshed had been in charge of the vessel during her later construction stages from January 1798, but she was eventually commissioned in June 1798 under Captain John Holloway, and a month later command passed to Captain John Pakenham, for Channel service. After a brief spell under Captain John Osborn in April 1799, the Ajax was placed in May 1799 under the command of Captain Alexander Cochrane, who was to command her for two years. On 9 January 1800 she captured the French privateer Avantageux in the Channel. In 1801, Cochrane and Ajax participated in the Egyptian operations. On 31 January Ajax anchored at Marmorice on the coast of Karamania. On 1 March, some 70 warships, together with transports carrying 16,000 troops, anchored in Aboukir Bay near Alexandria. Bad weather delayed disembarkation by a week, but on the 8th, Cochrane directed a landing by 320 boats, in double line abreast, which brought the troops ashore. French shore batteries opposed the landing, but the British were able to drive them back and by the next day Sir Ralph Abercromby's whole force was ashore.Allardyce (1882), p.257. Ajax had two of her seamen killed in the landings. The naval vessels provided a force of 1,000 seamen to fight alongside the army, with Sir Sidney Smith of the 74-gun HMS Tigre in command. On 13 March, Ajax lost one man killed and two wounded in an action on shore; on 21 March she lost two killed and two wounded. After the Battle of Alexandria and the subsequent siege, Cochrane in Ajax, with the sixth rate HMS Bonne Citoyenne, sloop HMS Cynthia, the brig-sloops HMS Port Mahon and HMS Victorieuse, and three Turkish corvettes, were the first vessels to enter the harbour. Because Ajax had served in the Egyptian campaign between 8 March 1801 and 2 September, her officers and crew qualified for the clasp \\"Egypt\\" to the Naval General Service Medal that the Admiralty authorised in 1850 to all surviving claimants. Ajax returned to Plymouth from Egypt on 8 June 1802 after the signing of the Treaty of Amiens. 1805 In April, Admiral Lord Gardner sent Ajax, together with HMS Malta and HMS Terrible to reinforce Vice-Admiral Sir Robert Calder's squadron off Ferrol after a storm had reduced the squadron to only five ships of the line. On 31 May 1805 Captain William Brown took command of Ajax. On 22 July, Calder's fleet of 15 sail of the line, two frigates, a cutter and a lugger was off Cape Finisterre when it encountered Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve's combined Spanish-French fleet of 20 ships of the line, three large ships armed en flute, five frigates and two brigs. William Anderson, c.1810leftthumb Calder sailed towards the French with his force. The battle lasted for more than four hours as the fleets became confused in the failing light and thick patchy fog, which prevented either side from gaining a decisive victory. Still, the British were able to capture two Spanish ships, the 80-gun San Rafael and the 74-gun Firme. The action cost Ajax two men killed and 16 wounded. After undergoing repairs in Plymouth, on 18 September, Ajax and Thunderer, the latter under Captain William Lechmere, joined with Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson in and sailed from Plymouth for Cadiz on 18 September. Captains Brown and Lechmere were later called as witnesses at the court martial of Sir Robert Calder for his failure to resume the battle the next day in the action in July. As a result, First Lieutenant John Pilfold commanded Ajax at the Battle of Trafalgar. Ajax was seventh in line in Nelson‚Äôs column and she fired on both the French 74-gun Bucentaure and the Spanish 136-gun Santissima Trinidad. During the battle Ajax assisted HMS Orion in forcing the surrender of the French 74-gun Intr√©pide. Ajax lost two men killed and nine wounded during the battle. A storm followed the battle and Ajax rescued seamen from ships in danger of sinking. Lieutenant Pilfold received the Trafalgar medal and a direct promotion to Post-captain in December. Although he missed the battle, Brown was still the official captain and so too received the Trafalgar medal.Brown was then made Commissioner, first of Malta dockyards and then of Sheerness dockyards, before being promoted to Rear-Admiral. Next, he became C.-in-C. Channel Islands. He died of yellow fever in 1814 while C.-in-C. Jamaica. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Trafalgar\\" to all surviving claimants from the battle. After Trafalgar, Ajax was at the blockade of Cadiz. On 25 November, detained the Ragusan ship Nemesis, which was sailing from Isle de France to Leghorn, Italy, with a cargo of spice, indigo dye, and other goods. Ajax shared the prize money with ten other British warships. Loss of Ajax Duckworth's squadron forcing the Dardanelles On 1 February 1807 Ajax, under the command of Captain Henry Blackwood, joined Admiral Sir John Duckworth's squadron at Malta to participate in the Dardanelles Operation. During the operation an accidental fire destroyed Ajax. The fire began on the evening of 14 February while Ajax was anchored off Tenedos. The fire began in the bread- room where the purser and his assistant had negligently left a light burning.Gossett (1986), p.57. As the fire burned out of control, the officers and crew were forced to take to the water. Although 380 people were rescued, 250 lost their lives that night, including many of the crewmen who had been at Trafalgar. Ajax burned through the night and then drifted on to the island of Tenedos where she blew up the following morning.p.188, Brenton for description A court martial cleared Captain Blackwood. Horsham Museum The Shelley Gallery at Horsham Museum, Horsham, United Kingdom, displays a model of Ajax.

Porco (born March 6, 1953) is an American planetary scientist who explores the outer solar system, beginning with her imaging work on the Voyager missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune in the 1980s. She led the imaging science team on the Cassini mission in orbit around Saturn. She is an expert on planetary rings and the Saturnian moon, Enceladus. She has co- authored more than 110 scientific papers on subjects ranging from the spectroscopy of Uranus and Neptune, the interstellar medium, the photometry of planetary rings, satellite/ring interactions, computer simulations of planetary rings, the thermal balance of Triton's polar caps, heat flow in the interior of Jupiter, and a suite of results on the atmosphere, satellites, and rings of Saturn from the Cassini imaging experiment. In 2013, Cassini data confirmed a 1993 prediction by Porco and Mark Marley that acoustic oscillations within the body of Saturn are responsible for creating particular features in the rings of Saturn. Porco was founder of The Day the Earth Smiled. She was also responsible for the epitaph and proposal to honor the late renowned planetary geologist Eugene Shoemaker by sending his cremains to the Moon aboard the Lunar Prospector spacecraft in 1998. A frequent public speaker, Porco has given two popular lectures at TED as well as the opening speech for Pangea Day, a May 2008 global broadcast coordinated from six cities around the world, in which she described the cosmic context for human existence. Porco has also won a number of awards and honors for her contributions to science and the public sphere; for instance, in 2009, New Statesman named her as one of 'The 50 People Who Matter Today.' In 2010, Porco was awarded the Carl Sagan Medal, presented by the American Astronomical Society for Excellence in the Communication of Science to the Public. In 2012, she was named one of the 25 most influential people in space by Time magazine.  Early life and education  Porco was born in New York City. She graduated in 1970 from Cardinal Spellman High School in the Bronx, New York City. She earned a B.S. degree in Earth and Space Sciences from Stony Brook University in 1974. She received her Ph.D. degree in Planetary Sciences in 1983 from the California Institute of Technology in the Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences. Supervised by dynamicist Peter Goldreich, she wrote her doctoral dissertation focused on Voyager discoveries in the rings of Saturn.Thesis Carolyn Porco: Voyager Observations of Saturn's Rings. 1. The Eccentric Rings at 1.29, 1.45, 1.95 and 2.27 R‚Çõ. 2. The Periodic Variation of Spokes - website of the Library of Caltech  Career = Voyager  In the fall of 1983, Dr. Porco joined the faculty of the Department of Planetary Sciences at the University of Arizona; the same year she was made a member of the Voyager Imaging Team. In the latter capacity, she was an active participant in the Voyager 2 encounters with Uranus in 1986 and Neptune in 1989, leading the Rings Working Group within the Voyager Imaging Team during the Neptune encounter. As a young Voyager scientist, she was the first person to describe the behavior of the eccentric ringlets and the \\"spokes\\" discovered by Voyager within the rings of Saturn; to elucidate the mechanism by which the outer Uranian rings were being shepherded by the Voyager-discovered moons Cordelia and Ophelia; and to provide an explanation for the shepherding of the rings arcs of Neptune by the moon Galatea, also discovered by Voyager. She was a co- originator of the idea to take a 'portrait of the planets' with the Voyager 1 spacecraft, and participated in the planning, design, and execution of those images in 1990, including the famous Pale Blue Dot image of Earth.  Cassini‚ÄìHuygens  In November 1990, Porco was selected as the leader of the Imaging Team for the Cassini-Huygens mission, an international mission that successfully placed a spacecraft in orbit around Saturn and deployed the atmospheric Huygens probe to Saturn's largest satellite, Titan. She is also the Director of the Cassini Imaging Central Laboratory for Operations (CICLOPS), which was the center of uplink and downlink operations for the Cassini imaging science experiment and the place where Cassini images are processed for release to the public. CICLOPS is part of the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colorado. In the course of the ongoing mission, Porco and her team have discovered seven moons of Saturn: Methone and Pallene, Polydeuces, Daphnis, Anthe, Aegaeon, and a small moonlet in the outer B ring. They also found several new rings, such as rings coincident with the orbits of Atlas, Janus and Epimetheus (the Saturnian 'co-orbitals') and Pallene; a diffuse ring between Atlas and the F ring; and new rings within several of the gaps in Saturn's rings. In 2013, Cassini data confirmed a 1993 prediction by Porco and Mark Marley that acoustic oscillations within the body of Saturn are responsible for creating particular features in the rings of Saturn. This confirmation, the first to demonstrate that planetary rings can act like a seismograph in recording oscillatory motions within the host planet, should provide new constraints on the interior structure of Saturn. Such oscillations are known to exist in the sun as well as other stars. Porco's team was responsible for the first sighting of a hydrocarbon lake, as well as a lake district, in the south polar region of Titan in June 2005. (A group of similar ‚Äì and larger ‚Äì features were sighted in the north polar region in February 2007.) The possibility that these sea-sized features are either completely or partially filled with liquid hydrocarbons is significantly strengthened by subsequent observations by other Cassini instruments. Her team was also responsible for the first sighting of plumes erupting from Enceladus, Saturn's sixth largest moon. They first suggested, and provided detailed scientific arguments, that these jets might be geysers erupting from reservoirs of near- surface liquid water under the south pole of the small moon.  New Horizons  Porco was a member of the imaging team for the New Horizons mission to Pluto and the Kuiper Belt through 2014. The probe made its Pluto flyby in 2015. The Day the Earth Smiled As the Cassini imaging team lead, Porco initiated and planned the capture of a picture of Saturn with the Earth in the distance on July 19, 2013, an image along the lines of the famous Pale Blue Dot photo. The taking of the image was part of a larger concept entitled The Day The Earth Smiled, in which people the world over were invited to celebrate humanity's place in the cosmos and life on Earth by smiling the moment the picture was taken.  University positions  Porco served in the faculty of the University of Arizona from 1983 to 2001, achieving tenured professorship in 1991. She taught both graduates and undergraduates and was one of five finalists for the University of Arizona Honors Center Five Star Faculty Award, a campus-wide student-nominated, student-judged award for outstanding undergraduate teaching. Porco is a Senior Research Scientist at the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colorado, and she is an Adjunct Professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder.  NASA advisor  Porco has been an active participant in guiding the American planetary exploration program through membership on many important NASA advisory committees, including the Solar System Exploration Subcommittee, the Mars Observer Recovery Study Team, and the Solar System Road Map Development Team. In the mid-1990s, she served as the chairperson for a small NASA advisory working group to study and develop future outer solar system missions and she served as the Vice Chairperson of the Steering Group for the first Solar System Decadal Survey, sponsored by NASA and the National Academy of Sciences.  Public speaking  Porco speaks frequently on the Cassini mission and planetary exploration in general, and has appeared at renowned conferences such as PopTech 2005 and TED (2007, 2009). She attended and was a speaker at the Beyond Belief symposium on November 2006.A Free-for-All on Science and Religion, The New York Times, November 21, 2006. Porco's 2007 TED talk, \\"The Human Journey,\\" detailed two major areas of discovery made by the Cassini mission: the exploration of the Saturnian moons Titan and Enceladus. In her introductory remarks, Porco explained: In describing the environment of Titan, with its molecular nitrogen atmosphere suffused with organic compounds, Porco invited her audience to imagine the scene on the moon's surface: After describing various features discovered on Titan by Cassini, and presenting the historic first photograph of Titan's surface by the Huygens lander, Porco went on to describe Enceladus and the jets of \\"fine icy particles\\" which erupt from the moon's southern pole: Porco's 2009 TED Talk was \\"Could a Saturn moon harbor life?\\". She was a speaker at the 2016 Reason Rally.  Television and film  Porco has been a regular CNN guest analyst and consultant on astronomy, has made many radio and television appearances explaining science to the lay audience, including appearances on the MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour, CBS's 60 Minutes, Peter Jennings's The Century, and TV documentaries on planetary exploration such as The Planets on the Discovery Channel and the BBC, A Traveler's Guide to the Planets on the National Geographic Channel, Horizon on the BBC, and a Nova Cassini special on PBS. For the 2003 A&E; special on the Voyager mission entitled Cosmic Journey: The Voyager Interstellar Mission and Message, Porco appeared onscreen and also served as the show's science advisor and animation director. Porco served as an adviser for the film Contact (1997), which was based on a novel by the well-known astronomer Carl Sagan. The actress Jodie Foster portrayed the heroine in the movie, and Sagan reportedly suggested that she use Porco as a real-life model to guide her performance. Porco was also an adviser on the film Star Trek (2009). The scene in which the Enterprise comes out of warp drive into the atmosphere of Titan, and rises submarine-style out of the haze, with Saturn and the rings in the background, was Porco's suggestion. Porco was a guest on the BBC's Stargazing Live Series 4 in January 2014. She also appeared in The Farthest, a 2017 documentary on the Voyager program.  Interviews and articles  Porco has given numerous interviews in print media on subjects ranging from planetary exploration to the conflict between science and religion (for example, Newsweek and the journal The Humanist). She has been profiled many times in print, beginning in the Boston Globe (October 1989), The New York Times (August 1999, September 2009), the Tucson Citizen (2001), Newsday (June 2004), for the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada (2006), in Astronomy Now (2006), in Discover Magazine (2007), and also online on CNN.com (2005) and Edge.org. Prior to Cassinis launch, she was a strong and visible defendant of the usage of radioactive materials on the Cassini spacecraft. She is a supporter of a plan for human spaceflight toward the Moon and Mars, and in an op-ed piece published in The New York Times, she highlighted the benefits of a deep-space- capable heavy launch vehicle for the robotic exploration of the Solar System. Porco has advocated for prioritizing the exploration of Enceladus over Europa.  Other  In 1994, Porco was a member of a committee (chaired by Carl Sagan) entitled \\"Public Communication of NASA's Science\\", and in 1999, she reviewed a biography of Sagan for The Guardian. Her popular science articles have been published in The Sunday Times, Astronomy, the Arizona Daily Star, Sky & Telescope, American Scientist, and Scientific American. She is active in the presentation of science to the public as the leader of the Cassini Imaging Team, as the creator/editor of the website where Cassini images are posted. She writes the site's homepage \\"Captain's Log\\" greeting to the public. She is an atheist. She is also the CEO of Diamond Sky Productions, a small company devoted to the scientific, as well as artful, use of planetary images and computer graphics for the presentation of science to the public.  Awards and honors  In 1999, Porco was selected by The Sunday Times (London) as one of 18 scientific leaders of the 21st century, and by Industry Week as one of 50 Stars to Watch. In 2008 she was chosen to be on Wired magazine's inaugural 'Smart List: 15 People the Next President Should Listen To.' Her contributions to the exploration of the outer Solar System were recognized with the naming of Asteroid (7231) Porco which is \\"Named in honor of Carolyn C. Porco, a pioneer in the study of planetary ring systems...and a leader in spacecraft exploration of the outer solar system.\\" In 2008, Porco was awarded the Isaac Asimov Science Award by the American Humanist Association. In May 2009, Porco received an Honorary D.Sc. degree from Stony Brook University, of which she is an alumna. In September 2009, Porco was awarded The Huntington Library's Science Writer Fellowship for 2010. That same month, New Statesman named her as one of 'The 50 People Who Matter Today.' In October 2009, she and Babak Amin Tafreshi were each awarded the 2009 Lennart Nilsson Award in recognition of their photographic work. The award panel's citation for Dr. Porco reads as follows: In October 2010, Porco was awarded the 2010 Carl Sagan Medal for Excellence in the Communication of Science to the Public, presented by the American Astronomical Society's Division for Planetary Sciences. And in 2011 she won the Distinguished Alumni Award from the California Institute of Technology, the highest honor regularly bestowed by Caltech. In 2012, Porco was named one of the 25 most influential people in space by Time magazine.  Musical interests  Abbey Road with the other members of the Cassini Imaging Team. Porco is fascinated by the 1960s and The Beatles and has, at times, incorporated references to The Beatles and their music into her presentations, writings, and press releases. The first color image released by Cassini to the public was an image of Jupiter, taken during Cassinis approach to the giant planet and released on October 9, 2000, to honor John Lennon‚Äôs 60th birthday. In 2006, she produced and directed a brief 8-minute movie of 64 of Cassinis most spectacular images, put to the music of the Beatles, in honor of Paul McCartney‚Äôs 64th birthday. And in 2007, she produced a poster showing 64 scenes from Saturn. Porco is also interested in dance and fascinated with Michael Jackson. In August 2010, she won a Michael Jackson costume/dance contest held in Boulder, Colorado. Quotes of Porco's were used in the production of \\"The Poetry of Reality (An Anthem for Science)\\", \\"A Wave of Reason\\", \\"Children of Africa (The Story of Us)\\", and \\"Onward to the Edge!\\" by Symphony of Science.

Family Constance was born in about 1375, the only daughter of Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York, and his wife, Isabella of Castile, the youngest daughter of King Peter of Castile and his mistress, Mar√≠a de Padilla. Plots against Henry IV Constance married Thomas le Despenser, 1st Earl of Gloucester who was created Earl of Gloucester by King Richard II on 29 September 1397, but after Richard's deposition and the accession of King Henry IV some of Thomas's lands were seized and he was degraded from the earldom. In consequence in late December 1399 he and others joined in a plot, known as the Epiphany Rising, to assassinate King Henry and restore King Richard to the throne. According to a French chronicle the plot was betrayed to the King by Constance's brother, Edward; however contemporary English chronicles make no mention of Edward's alleged role. Gloucester escaped immediate capture, but was eventually turned in to the authorities at Bristol, where he was beheaded on 13 January 1400.; . After her husband's death, Constance was granted a life interest in the greater part of his lands and custody of her son due her close kinship to the king.; . In February 1405, during the rebellion of Owain Glynd≈µr, Constance herself instigated a plot to abduct the young Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March, and his brother, Roger Mortimer, from Windsor Castle, apparently intending to deliver the young Earl, who had the best claim to the throne of any of Henry IV's rivals, to his uncle Sir Edmund Mortimer, who was married to Glyndwr's daughter. The young Edmund Mortimer and his brother were recaptured before entering Wales. Constance implicated her elder brother, Edward, in the plot, as a result of which he was imprisoned for 17 weeks at Pevensey Castle, but was eventually restored to Henry IV's favour as well as the seized property of Constance who had been sent to Kenilworth Castle. Constance died in 1416 after the accession of Henry V, outliving her both siblings, but she was buried at the High Altar in Reading Abbey as late as 1420.

The film tells the story of a young Jewish girl who, after being separated from her father in Soviet Russia, grows up in England. As a young adult, she moves to Paris (shortly before the beginning of World War II). This is the last film worked on by the French cinematographer Sacha Vierny. Plot Fegele Abramovich (Christina Ricci), a Russian Jew is separated from her father (Oleg Yankovsky) as a child in 1927. Her father has travelled to America to seek his fortune and plans to send for Fegele and her grandmother. Before leaving, he sings \\"Je Crois Entendre Encore\\" from the Bizet opera Les p√™cheurs de perles to her. After her father leaves, the village is attacked and burned in a pogrom. Fegele escapes with the help of neighbours; after overcoming many obstacles, she is crowded onto a boat headed for Britain, with only a photo of her father and a coin given to her by her grandmother. Upon arrival, an English official renames her \\"Susan\\" and places her with foster parents. English students at school taunt her by calling her a \\"gypsy\\", but she does not yet understand English. A teacher at the school overhears her singing \\"Je Crois Entendre Encore\\" in Yiddish, and teaches her to sing and speak in English. Time passes, and Suzie auditions for a singing dance troupe heading for Paris. There, she meets an older Russian dancer named Lola (Cate Blanchett), and they share an apartment as friends. At a formal party, both women perform as dancers alongside a mysterious performing horseman, Cesar (Johnny Depp), a Romani to whom Suzie is attracted. After their performance outside, they overhear a tenor inside singing \\"Je Crois Entendre Encore\\"; the voice belongs to Dante (John Turturro), an Italian opera singer who immediately catches Lola's eye. Lola works her way into his good graces and falls for his charms, enticed by his wealth and success. Dante, Lola, Suzie, and Cesar all work for an opera company directed by Felix Perlman (Harry Dean Stanton). Dante is an imperious follower of Mussolini; this alienates him from Suzie even as he becomes Lola's lover. Meanwhile, Cesar introduces Suzie to his \\"family\\" (essentially his entire tribe), and they fall in love. One day, Dante is rifling through Suzie's things after a dalliance with Lola in the apartment, and deduces her Jewish heritage after finding her father's photo. An elderly Jewish neighbour downstairs, Madame Goldstein (Miriam Karlin), also knows that Suzie is Jewish and has warned her of the dangers on the horizon as the Germans invade Poland. The following year, as the Germans invade France and approach Paris, an exodus begins of Jews and other people threatened by Nazism. Crowds for the operatic show dwindle, and eventually the only cast members left are Dante and Suzie. When Dante attempts to seduce Suzie, she rebuffs him. He lashes out at her for her heritage and her relationship with Cesar, whose heritage he also scorns. Perlman comes to her defence; he reminds Dante that as an Italian in Paris at that time, should Mussolini align with the Nazis, Dante's own position in Paris would be precarious. Perlman closes down the show; the Nazis enter Paris the following morning. Dante reluctantly returns to his earlier role as minstrel. After another rebuff from Suzie, Dante reveals to a German officer that Suzie is a Jew. Lola overhears this and informs Suzie that she is in danger and must leave Paris. Lola has also decided to leave Dante and has purchased tickets for Suzie and herself on an ocean liner headed for America. The same night of the party, the Nazis attack the Romani village and kill a child. When Cesar comes to her apartment to say goodbye, Suzie expresses her desire to stay and help Cesar fight the Nazis for his family, but he tells her she must flee and find her father. They share a tender last evening together. Suzie searches for her father and discovers that he changed his name, gave up singing, and moved west after hearing about the attack on his home village, which he assumed killed all the members of his family. Suzie goes to Hollywood, where her father was a studio head, and discovers he has a new family and that he is dying. She goes to the hospital, walks past his new wife and children who are waiting outside the door to his room, and is reunited with her father. He recognises her and expresses joy at her appearance. She sits on the side of his bed and sings \\"Je Crois Entendre Encore\\" to him in Yiddish as tears roll down her face.

Josef Hyrtl (7 December 1810 - 17 July 1894) was an Austrian anatomist. Biography Hyrtl was born at Kismarton, (now Eisenstadt) in Hungary. He began his medical studies in Vienna in 1831, having received his preliminary education in his native town. His parents were poor, and he had to find sosoefray the expenses of his medical education. In 1833, while he was still a student, he was named prosector in anatomy, and the preparations which this position required him to make for teaching purposes attracted the attention of professors as well as students. His graduation thesis, Antiquitates anatomic√¶ rariores, was a prophecy of the work to which his life was to be devoted. On graduation he became Prof. Czermak's assistant (famulus) and later became also the curator of the museum. He added valuable treasures to the museum by the preparations which he made for it. As a student he set up a little laboratory and dissecting room in his lodgings, and his injections of anatomical material were greatly admired. He took advantage of his post in the museum to give special courses in anatomy to students and in practical anatomy to physicians. These courses were numerously attended. In 1837, when only twenty-six, Hyrtl was offered the professorship of anatomy at the University of Prague, and by his work there laid the foundation of his great reputation as a teacher of anatomy. There he completed his well-known textbook of human anatomy, which went through some twenty editions and has been translated into several languages. The chair of anatomy at Vienna fell vacant in 1845. Satisfied with the opportunities for work at Prague, he would not have applied for the post but for the insistence of his friends. He was immediately elected. Five years later he published his Handbook of Topographic Anatomy, the first textbook of applied anatomy of its kind ever issued. Before his death he was to see this department of anatomy become one of the most important portions of the teaching in the medical schools of the world. It was as a teacher that Hyrtl did his great work. Professor Karl von Bardeleben, himself one of the great teachers of the nineteenth century, did not hesitate to say that in this Hyrtl was unequalled. His fame spread throughout Europe, and he came to be looked upon as the special glory of the University of Vienna. In 1858, he was visited by George Eliot and her partner. In her journal, she wrote: \\"Another great pleasure we had at Vienna‚Äînext after the sight of St. Stephen's and the pictures‚Äîwas a visit to Hyrtl, the anatomist, who showed us some of his wonderful preparations, showing the vascular and nervous systems in the lungs, liver, kidneys, and intestinal canal of various animals. He told us the deeply interesting story of the loss of his fortune in the Vienna revolution of '48. He was compelled by the revolutionists to attend on the wounded for three days' running. When at last he came to his house to change his clothes he found nothing but four bare [40] walls! His fortune in Government bonds was burned along with the house, as well as all his precious collection of anatomical preparations, etc. He told us that since that great shock his nerves have been so susceptible that he sheds tears at the most trifling events, and has a depression of spirits which often keeps him silent for days. He only received a very slight sum from Government in compensation for his loss.\\" In 1865, on the occasion of the celebration of the five- hundredth anniversary of the foundation of the university, he was chosen rector in order that, as the most distinguished member of the university, he should represent her on that day. His inaugural address as rector had for its subject The Materialistic Conception of The Universe of Our Time. In this he argued that there was clear lack of logic in the materialistic view of the world and concluded: \\"When I bring all this together it is impossible for me to understand on what scientific grounds is founded this resurrection of the old materialistic view of the world that had its first great expression from Epicurus and Lucretius. Nothing that I can see justifies it, and there is no reason to think that it will continue to hold domination over men's minds.\\" His brother Jakob Hyrtl (1799-1868) was a Viennese engraver, who bequeathed to his brother Josef Hyrtl the skull attributed to Mozart. Josef Hyrtl examined the skull and bequeathed it to the city of Salzburg.Puech P.-F. 2019. Applied Anthropology in the Biography of Mozart. Human Evolution International Journal. Vol.34 (3-4): 259. In 1880 there was a magnificent celebration of Hyrtl's seventieth birthday, when messages of congratulation were sent to him from all the universities of the world. After retiring from his professorship he continued to do good work, his last publication being on Arabic and Hebraic elements in anatomy. On the morning of 17 July 1894, he was found dead in bed at his estate near Vienna. His monograph for the reform of anatomical terminology Onomatologia Anatomica (Vienna, 1880), attracted widespread attention.

It was built to showcase King Leopold II's Congo Free State in the 1897 World Exhibition. The museum focuses on the Congo, a former Belgian colony. The sphere of interest however (especially in biological research) extends to the whole Congo River basin, Middle Africa, East Africa, and West Africa, attempting to integrate \\"Africa\\" as a whole. Intended originally as a colonial museum, from 1960 onwards it has focused more on ethnography and anthropology. Like most museums, it houses a research department in addition to its public exhibit department. Not all research pertains to Africa (e.g. research on the archaeozoology of Sagalassos, Turkey). Some researchers have strong ties with the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences. In November 2013, the museum closed for extensive renovation work (including the construction of new exhibition space) and re-opened in December 2018. History The interior of the original exhibit in the Palais des Colonies The interior of the museum, photographed in 2011, shortly before the museum's major renovation After his Congo Free State was recognized by the Berlin Conference of 1884‚Äì1885, King Leopold II wanted to publicise the civilizing mission and the economic opportunities available in the colony to a wider public, both in Belgium and internationally. After considering other places, the king decided to have a temporary exhibition in his royal estate at Tervuren. When the 1897 International Exposition was held in Brussels, a colonial section was built in Tervuren, connected to the city centre by the monumental Avenue de Tervueren. The Brussels-Tervuren tram line 44 was built at the same time as the original museum by King Leopold II to bring the visitors from the city centre to the colonial exhibition. The colonial section was hosted in the (Palace of the Colonies). The building was designed by the Belgian architect Albert-Philippe Aldophe and the classical gardens by French landscape architect Elie Lain√©. In the main hall designed a distinctive wooden Art Nouveau structure to evoke the forest, using Bilinga wood, an African tree. The exhibition displayed ethnographic objects, stuffed animals and Congolese export products (coffee, cacao and tobacco). In the park, a temporary \\"Human zoo\\" - a copy of an African village - was built, in which 60 Congolese people lived for the duration of the exhibition.http://www.brusselstimes.com/opinion/8630/a-king-congo-and-a-museum The museum during the renovation (2016) In 1898 the Palace of the Colonies became the Museum of the Congo (Mus√©e du Congo) and a permanent exhibition was installed. A decade later, in 1912, a small, similar museum - the (African Museum of Namur) - was opened in Namur. The Museum began to support academic research, but due to the avid collecting of the scientists, the collection soon grew too large for the museum and enlargement was needed. Tervuren became a rich suburb of Brussels. The new museum started construction in 1904 and was designed by the French architect Charles Girault in neoclassical \\"palace\\" architecture, reminiscent of Petit Palais in Paris, with large gardens extending into the Tervuren Forest (a part of the Sonian Forest). It was officially opened by King Albert I in 1910 and named the Museum of the Belgian Congo (Mus√©e du Congo Belge or Museum van Belgisch-Kongo). In 1952 the adjective \\"Royal\\" was added. In preparation for Expo '58, in 1957 a large building was constructed to accommodate African personnel working in the exhibition: the Centre d'Accueil du Personnel Africain (CAPA). In 1960, following the independence of the Congo, the museum's name was changed to its current name: the Royal Museum for Central Africa.https://leading- edge.iac.gatech.edu/aaproceedings/towards-the-renewal-and-the-renovation-of- the-royal-museum-for-central-africa/ In late 2013 the museum was closed to allow a major renovation of its exhibits and an extension. It was reopened in December 2018. 66 million euros was spent on the modernization by the Belgian government. The additional space allows contemporary art from Central Africa to be displayed alongside the original colonial exhibits.

Controversy 250px There has been controversy surrounding the Museum. It had been called a museum that \\"has remained frozen in time\\" as it showed how a museum looked like in the mid- twentieth century. No mention was made of the savage excesses and pillage during Belgium's colonial era. The Guardian reported in July 2002 that, after initial outrage by Belgian historians over King Leopold's Ghost by Adam Hochschild, the state-funded museum would finance an investigation into Hochschild's allegations. The resulting more modern exhibition \\"The Memory of Congo\\" (February‚ÄìOctober 2005), tried to tell the story of the Congo Free State before it became a Belgian colony and a less one-sided view of the Belgian colonial era. The exhibition was praised by the international press, with French newspaper Le Monde claiming that \\"the museum has done better than revisit a particularly stormy page in history...[it] has pushed the public to join it in looking into the reality of colonialism.\\" Hochschild himself had a mixed critique of the renovated museum.

History Totem urbain / histoire en dentelle, a Pierre Granche sculpture, museum exterior. On October 13, 1921, the McCord National Museum, as it was then called, moved to the former McGill Union building, designed by Percy Erskine Nobbs in the Arts and Crafts tradition. The collection was based on the McCord family collection. Since 1878, David Ross McCord had been adding to the already considerable collection assembled by his family since their arrival in Canada. Over the years, he developed the plan of founding a national history museum in Montreal, at that time Canada's metropolis. The building that now houses the museum was administered by McGill University for over sixty years, when it was the seat of the student government. After riots targeted at SSMU led to the building's storming and several executives being taken hostage, McGill University set out to build a more secure building, University Centre, the current seat of SSMU. Leading members of the community lent their support to the museum over the years. Today, the McCord Museum is supported by the governments of Canada, Quebec and Montreal, and by a large network of members, donors and sponsors. Collection The museum was founded in 1921 by David Ross McCord, based on his own family collection of objects. Since then, the museum's holdings have increased substantially.

This sensory modality is used by a range of animals for orientation and navigation, and as a method for animals to develop regional maps. In navigation, magnetoreception deals with the detection of the Earth's magnetic field. Magnetoreception is present in bacteria, arthropods, molluscs, and members of all major taxonomic groups of vertebrates. Humans are not thought to have a magnetic sense, but there is a protein (a cryptochrome) in the eye which could serve this function. Proposed mechanisms= In bacteria  Magnetotactic bacteria is a class of bacteria known to use magnetic fields for orientation. These bacteria demonstrate a behavioral phenomenon known as magnetotaxis which is how the bacterium orients itself and migrates in the direction along the Earth's magnetic field lines. The bacteria contain magnetosomes, which are nanometer- sized particles of magnetite or iron sulfide enclosed within the bacterial cells. The magnetosomes are surrounded by a membrane composed of phospholipids and fatty acids and contain at least 20 different proteins. Magnetosomes form in chains where the magnetic moments of each magnetosome align in parallel, causing each bacterium cell to essentially act as a magnetic dipole, giving the bacteria their permanent-magnet characteristics.  In animals  Cryptochromes = For animals the mechanism for magnetoreception is unknown, but there exist two main hypotheses to explain the phenomenon. According to one model, magnetoreception is possible via the radical pair mechanism. The radical-pair mechanism is well-established in spin chemistry, and was speculated to apply to magnetoreception in 1978 by Schulten et al.. In 2000, cryptochrome was proposed as the \\"magnetic molecule\\", so to speak, that could harbor magnetically sensitive radical-pairs. Cryptochrome, a flavoprotein found in the eyes of European robins and other animal species, is the only protein known to form photoinduced radical-pairs in animals. The function of cryptochrome is diverse across species, however, the photoinduction of radical-pairs occurs by exposure to blue light, which excites an electron in a chromophore. The Earth's magnetic field is only 0.5 gauss and radical pair mechanism is the only plausible way that weak magnetic fields can affect chemical changes. Cryptochromes are therefore thought to be essential for the light-dependent ability of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to sense magnetic fields. = Iron-based = The second proposed model for magnetoreception relies on clusters composed of iron, a natural mineral with strong magnetism. The idea is favorable as it builds up on the magnetoreceptive abilities of magnetotactic bacteria. These iron clusters have been observed mainly in homing pigeons in the upper beak, but also in other taxa. These iron clusters have been observed in two types of compounds: magnetite (Fe3O4) and maghemite (Œ≥-Fe2O3). Both are believed to play a part in the magnetic sense, particularly for the magnetic map sense. These concentrations are believed to be connected to the central nervous system to form a sensing system. Research has focused on magnetite concentrations, however, magnetite alone has been shown to not be in magnetosensitive neurons. Maghemite has been observed in platelet-like structures concentrated along the sensory dendrites of the upper beak, consistently in the nanoscale. When in the nanoscale, iron oxides will remain permanently magnetized at lengths greater than 50 nm and will become magnetized at lengths smaller than 50 nm. Since these platelets have been observed in collections of 5-10, they are thought to form dipoles local to the dendrite they are present in. These local magnetic changes then cause a mechanical response along the membrane of the nerve cell, leading to a change in ion concentrations. This ion concentration, with respect to the other dendrite clusters is believed to form the magnetic sense. = Ampullae of Lorenzini = Another less general type of magnetic sensing mechanism in animals that has been described is electromagnetic induction used by sharks, stingrays and chimaeras (cartilaginous fish). These species possess a unique electroreceptive organ known as ampullae of Lorenzini which can detect a slight variation in electric potential. These organs are made up of mucus-filled canals that connect from the skin's pores to small sacs within the animal's flesh that are also filled with mucus. The ampullae of Lorenzini are capable of detecting DC currents and have been proposed to be used in the sensing of the weak electric fields of prey and predators. These organs could also possibly sense magnetic fields, by means of Faraday's law: as a conductor moves through a magnetic field an electric potential is generated. In this case the conductor is the animal moving through a magnetic field, and the potential induced depends on the time varying rate of flux through the conductor according to V_{ind}=-\\\\frac{d\\\\phi}{dt}. These organs detect very small fluctuations in the potential difference between the pore and the base of the electroreceptor sack. An increase in potential results in a decrease in the rate of nerve activity, and a decrease in potential results in an increase in the rate of nerve activity. This is analogous to the behavior of a current carrying conductor; with a fixed channel resistance, an increase in potential would decrease the amount of current detected, and vice versa. These receptors are located along the mouth and nose of sharks and stingrays. Although debated, it has been proposed that in terrestrial animals the semicircular canals of the inner ear could host a magnetosensitive system based on electromagnetic induction. = Endosymbiotic magnetotactic bacteria = A more recent proposed explanation of magnetoreception in animals is through endosymbiosis with magnetotactic bacteria. This appears at least plausible, as the DNA of these bacteria is widespread in animals.  In invertebrates  The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans was proposed to orient to the magnetic field of the Earth using the first described set of magnetosensory neurons. Worms appear to use the magnetic field to orient during vertical soil migrations that change in sign depending on their satiation state (with hungry worms burrowing down, and satiated worms burrowing up). However, recent evidence challenges these findings. The mollusk Tochuina tetraquetra (formerly Tritonia diomedea or Tritonia gigantea) has been studied for clues as to the neural mechanism behind magnetoreception in a species. Some of the earliest work with Tochuina showed that prior to a full moon Tochuina would orient their bodies between magnetic north and east. A Y-maze was established with a right turn equal to geomagnetic south and a left turn equal to geomagnetic east. Within this geomagnetic field 80% of Tochuina made a turn to the left or magnetic east. However, when a reversed magnetic field was applied that rotated magnetic north 180¬∞ there was no significant preference for either turn, which now corresponded with magnetic north and magnetic west. These results, though interesting, do not conclusively establish that Tochuina uses magnetic fields in magnetoreception. These experiments do not include a control for the activation of the Rubens' coil in the reversed magnetic field experiments. Therefore, it is possible that heat or noise generated by the coil was responsible for the loss of choice preference. Further work with Tochuina was unable to identify any neurons that showed rapid changes in firing as a result of magnetic fields. However, pedal 5 neurons, two bisymmetric neurons located within the Tochuina pedal ganglion, exhibited gradual changes in firing over time following 30 minutes of magnetic stimulation provided by a Rubens' coil. Further studies showed that pedal 7 neurons in the pedal ganglion were inhibited when exposed to magnetic fields over the course of 30 minutes. The function of both pedal 5 neurons and pedal 7 neurons is currently unknown. Fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster needs cryptochrome to respond to magnetic fields. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is another invertebrate which may be able to orient to magnetic fields. Experimental techniques such as gene knockouts have allowed a closer examination of possible magnetoreception in these fruit flies. Various Drosophila strains have been trained to respond to magnetic fields. In a choice test flies were loaded into an apparatus with two arms that were surrounded by electric coils. Current was run through each of the coils, but only one was configured to produce a 5-Gauss magnetic field at a time. The flies in this T-maze were tested on their native ability to recognize the presence of the magnetic field in an arm and on their response following training where the magnetic field was paired with a sucrose reward. Many of the strains of flies showed a learned preference for the magnetic field following training. However, when the only cryptochrome found in Drosophila, type 1 Cry, is altered, either through a missense mutation or replacement of the Cry gene, the flies exhibit a loss of magnetosensitivity. Furthermore, when light is filtered to only allow wavelengths greater than 420 nm through, Drosophila loses its trained response to magnetic fields. This response to filtered light is likely linked to the action spectrum of fly-cryptochrome which has a range from 350 nm ‚Äì 400 nm and plateaus from 430-450 nm. Although researchers had believed that a tryptophan triad in cryptochrome was responsible for the free radicals on which magnetic fields could act, recent work with Drosophila has shown that tryptophan might not be behind cryptochrome dependent magnetoreception. Alteration of the tryptophan protein does not result in the loss of magnetosensitivity of a fly expressing either type 1 Cry or the cryptochrome found in vertebrates, type 2 Cry. Therefore, it remains unclear exactly how cryptochrome mediates magnetoreception. These experiments used a 5 gauss magnetic field, 10 times the strength of the Earth's magnetic field. Drosophila has not been shown to be able to respond to the Earth's weaker magnetic field. Studies of magnetoreception in vertebrate fish have been conducted mainly with salmon. For instance, the presence of an internal magnetic compass has been discovered in Sockeye Salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Researchers made this discovery by first placing the young of this species in a symmetrical, circular tank and allowing them to pass through exits in the tank freely. A mean vector was then calculated to represent the directional preferences of these salmon in the natural magnetic field. Notably, when the magnetic field was experimentally rotated, the directional preferences of the young Sockeye Salmon changed accordingly. As such, researchers concluded that the orientation of swimming behaviour in Sockeye Salmon is influenced by magnetic field information. Further research regarding magnetoreception in salmon has investigated Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tschawytscha). To induce a preference for magnetic east‚Äìwest, a group of these salmon were housed in a rectangular tank with water flowing from west to east for eighteen months. This group was also fed exclusively at the west end of the tank during this period. Upon placing these same salmon in a circular tank with symmetrical water flow, a preference for aligning their bodies with magnetic east‚Äìwest was observed as expected. However, when the magnetic field was rotated by 90¬∞, the salmon changed their preferred orientation to the north‚Äìsouth axis. From these results, researchers concluded that Chinook Salmon have the capacity to use magnetic field information in directional orientation. Magnetoreception is well documented in insects including honey bees, ants and termites. In ants and bees, this is used to orient and navigate in areas around their nests and within their migratory paths. For example, through the use of magnetoreception, the Brazilian stingless bee Schwarziana quadripunctata is able to distinguish differences in altitude, location, and directionality using the thousands of hair-like particles on its antennae.  In fish, amphibians and reptiles  Magnetoreception has been reported in the European eel,Eels May Use 'Magnetic Maps' As They Slither Across The Ocean while amphibians and reptiles including salamanders, toads and turtles exhibit alignment behaviours with respect to the Earth's magnetic field. Some of the earliest studies of amphibian magnetoreception were conducted with cave salamanders (Eurycea lucifuga). Researchers housed groups of cave salamanders in corridors aligned with either magnetic north‚Äìsouth, or magnetic east‚Äìwest. In tests, the magnetic field was experimentally rotated by 90¬∞, and salamanders were placed in cross-shaped structures (one corridor along the new north‚Äìsouth axis, one along the new east‚Äìwest axis). Considering these salamanders showed a significant preference for test corridors which matched the magnetic alignment of their housing corridors, researchers concluded that cave salamanders have the capacity to detect the Earth's magnetic field, and have a preference for movement along learned magnetic axes. Subsequent research has examined magnetoreception in a more natural setting. Under typical circumstances, red-spotted newts (Notophthalmus viridescens) respond to drastic increases in water temperature (which tend to indicate environmental deterioration) by orienting themselves toward the shoreline and heading for land. However, when magnetic fields are experimentally altered, this behaviour is disrupted, and assumed orientations fail to direct the newts to the shoreline. Moreover, the change in orientation corresponds to the degree by which the magnetic field is shifted. In other words, inversion of the magnetic poles (a 180¬∞ shift) results in inversion of the typical orientation (a 180¬∞ shift). Further research has shown that magnetic information is not only used by red-spotted newts for orientation toward the shoreline, but also in orientation toward their home pools. Ultimately, it seems as though red-spotted newts rely on information regarding the Earth's magnetic field for navigation within their environment, in particular when orienting toward the shoreline or toward home. In similar fashion, European (Bufo bufo) and Natterjack (Epidalea calamita) toads appear to rely, at least somewhat, on magnetic information for certain orienting behaviours. These species of anurans are known to rely on vision and olfaction when locating and migrating to breeding sites, but it seems magnetic fields may also play a role. When randomly displaced from their breeding sites, these toads remain well-oriented, and are capable of navigating their way back, even when displaced by more than 150 meters. However, when this displacement is accompanied by the experimental attachment of small magnetic bars, toads fail to relocate breeding sites. Considering experimental attachment of non- magnetized bars of equal size and weight does not affect relocation, it seems that magnetism is responsible for the observed disorientation of these toads. Therefore, researchers have concluded that orientation toward breeding sites in these anurans is influenced by magnetic field information. Loggerhead hatchlings to the sea The majority of study on magnetoreception in reptiles involves turtles. Some of the earliest support for magnetoreception in turtles was found in Terrapene carolina, a species of box turtle. After successfully teaching a group of these box turtles to swim to either the east or west end of an experimental tank, the introduction of a strong magnet into the tank was enough to disrupt the learned routes. As such, the learning of oriented paths seems to rely on some internal magnetic compass possessed by box turtles. Subsequent discovery of magnetite in the dura mater of Sea Turtle hatchlings supported this conclusion, as magnetite provides a means by which magnetic fields may be perceived. Furthermore, orientation toward the sea, a behaviour commonly seen in hatchlings of a number of turtle species, may rely, in part, on magnetoreception. In Loggerhead and Leatherback turtles, breeding takes place on beaches, and, after hatching, offspring crawl rapidly to the sea. Although differences in light density seem to drive this behaviour, magnetic alignment may also play a part. For instance, the natural directional preferences held by these hatchlings (which lead them from beaches to the sea) reverse upon experimental inversion of the magnetic poles, suggesting the Earth's magnetic field serves as a reference for proper orientation. In homing pigeons Homing pigeons can use magnetic fields as part of their complex navigation system. William Keeton showed that time-shifted homing pigeons (acclimatised in the laboratory to a different time-zone) are unable to orient themselves correctly on a clear, sunny day; this is attributed to time-shifted pigeons being unable to compensate accurately for the movement of the sun during the day. Conversely, time-shifted pigeons released on overcast days navigate correctly. This led to the hypothesis that under particular conditions, homing pigeons rely on magnetic fields to orient themselves. Further experiments with magnets attached to the backs of homing pigeons demonstrated that disruption of the bird's ability to sense the Earth's magnetic field leads to a loss of proper orientation behavior under overcast conditions. There have been two mechanisms implicated in homing pigeon magnetoreception: the visually mediated free-radical pair mechanism and a magnetite based directional compass or inclination compass. More recent behavioral tests have shown that pigeons are able to detect magnetic anomalies of 186 microtesla (1.86 Gauss). In a choice test birds were trained to jump onto a platform on one end of a tunnel if there was no magnetic field present and to jump onto a platform on the other end of the tunnel if a magnetic field was present. In this test, birds were rewarded with a food prize and punished with a time penalty. Homing pigeons were able to make the correct choice 55%-65% of the time which is higher than what would be expected if the pigeons were simply guessing. For a long time the trigeminal system was the suggested location for a magnetite-based magnetoreceptor in the pigeon. This was based on two findings: First, magnetite-containing cells were reported in specific locations in the upper beak. Subsequent studies, however, revealed that these cells were macrophages, not magnetosensitive neurons. Second, pigeon magnetic field detection is impaired by sectioning the trigeminal nerve and by application of lidocaine, an anesthetic, to the olfactory mucosa. However, lidocaine treatment might lead to unspecific effects and not represent a direct interference with potential magnetoreceptors. Therefore, an involvement of the trigeminal system is still debated. In the search for magnetite receptors, a large iron containing organelle (the cuticulosome) in the inner ear of pigeons was discovered. This organelle might represent part of an alternative magnetosensitive system. Taken together the receptor responsible for magnetosensitivity in homing pigeons remains uncertain. Aside from the sensory receptor for magnetic reception in homing pigeons there has been work on neural regions that are possibly involved in the processing of magnetic information within the brain. Areas of the brain that have shown increases in activity in response to magnetic fields with a strength of 50 or 150 microtesla are the posterior vestibular nuclei, dorsal thalamus, hippocampus, and visual hyperpallium. In domestic hens Domestic hens have iron mineral deposits in the sensory dendrites in the upper beak and are capable of magnetoreception.Wiltschko, W., Freire, R., Munro, U., Ritz, T., Rogers, L.J., Thalau, P., and Wiltschko. R., (2007). The magnetic compass of domestic chicken, Gallus gallus. Journal Experimental Biology, 210:2300‚Äì2310 Because hens use directional information from the magnetic field of the Earth to orient in relatively small areas, this raises the possibility that beak- trimming (removal of part of the beak, to reduce injurious pecking, frequently performed on egg-laying hens) impairs the ability of hens to orient in extensive systems, or to move in and out of buildings in free-range systems. In mammals Several mammals, including the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) can use magnetic fields for orientation. Work with mice, mole-rats and bats has shown that some mammals are capable of magnetoreception. When woodmice are removed from their home area and deprived of visual and olfactory cues, they orient themselves towards their homes until an inverted magnetic field is applied to their cage. However, when the same mice are allowed access to visual cues, they are able to orient themselves towards home despite the presence of inverted magnetic fields. This indicates that when woodmice are displaced, they use magnetic fields to orient themselves if there are no other cues available. However, early studies of these subjects were criticized because of the difficulty of completely removing sensory cues, and in some because the tests were performed out of the natural environment. In others, the results of these experiments do not conclusively show a response to magnetic fields when deprived of other cues, because the magnetic field was artificially changed before the test rather than during it. Recent experiments, however, confirmed that woodmice have a magnetic sense which is likely based on a radical-pair mechanism. The Zambian mole-rat, a subterranean mammal, uses magnetic fields as a polarity compass to aid in the orientation of their nests. In contrast to woodmice, Zambian mole-rats do not rely on radical-pair based magnetoreception, a result that has been suggested is due to their subterranean lifestyle. Further investigation of mole-rat magnetoreception lead to the finding that exposure to magnetic fields leads to an increase in neural activity within the superior colliculus as measured by immediate early gene expression. The activity level of neurons within two levels of the superior colliculus, the outer sublayer of the intermediate gray layer and the deep gray layer, were elevated in a non-specific manner when exposed to various magnetic fields. However, within the inner sublayer of the intermediate gray layer (InGi) there were two or three clusters of cells that respond in a more specific manner. The more time the mole rats were exposed to a magnetic field the greater the immediate early gene expression within the InGi. However, if Zambian mole-rats were placed in a field with a shielded magnetic field only a few scattered cells were active. Therefore, it has been proposed that in mammals, the superior colliculus is an important neural structure in the processing of magnetic information. Bats may also use magnetic fields to orient themselves. While it is known that bats use echolocation to navigate over short distances, it is unclear how they navigate over longer distances. When Eptesicus fuscus are taken from their home roosts and exposed to magnetic fields 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise of magnetic north, they are disoriented and set off for their homes in the wrong direction. Therefore, it seems that Eptesicus fuscus is capable of magnetoreception. However, the exact use of magnetic fields by Eptesicus fuscus is unclear as the magnetic field could be used either as a map, a compass, or a compass calibrator. Recent research with another bat species, Myotis myotis, supports the hypothesis that bats use magnetic fields as a compass calibrator and their primary compass is the sun. Red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) may use magnetoreception when predating small rodents. When foxes perform their high-jumps onto small prey like mice and voles, they tend to jump in a north-eastern compass direction. In addition, successful attacks are \\"tightly clustered\\" to the north. One study has found that when domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) are off the leash and the Earth's magnetic field is calm, they prefer to urinate and defecate with their bodies aligned on a north‚Äìsouth axis. There is also evidence for magnetoreception in large mammals. Resting and grazing cattle as well as roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and red deer (Cervus elaphus) tend to align their body axes in the geomagnetic north‚Äìsouth direction. Because wind, sunshine, and slope could be excluded as common ubiquitous factors in this study, alignment toward the vector of the magnetic field provided the most likely explanation for the observed behaviour. However, because of the descriptive nature of this study, alternative explanations (e.g., the sun compass) could not be excluded. In a follow-up study, researchers analyzed body orientations of ruminants in localities where the geomagnetic field is disturbed by high-voltage power lines to determine how local variation in magnetic fields may affect orientation behaviour. This was done by using satellite and aerial images of herds of cattle and field observations of grazing roe deer. Body orientation of both species was random on pastures under or near power lines. Moreover, cattle exposed to various magnetic fields directly beneath or in the vicinity of power lines trending in various magnetic directions exhibited distinct patterns of alignment. The disturbing effect of the power lines on body alignment diminished with the distance from the conductors. In 2011 a group of Czech researchers, however, reported their failed attempt to replicate the finding using different Google Earth images. Humans \\"are not believed to have a magnetic sense\\", but humans do have a cryptochrome (a flavoprotein, CRY2) in the retina which has a light-dependent magnetosensitivity. CRY2 \\"has the molecular capability to function as a light-sensitive magnetosensor\\", so the area was thought (2011) to be ripe for further study. Issues Despite more than 50 years of research, a sensory receptor in animals has yet to be identified for magnetoreception. It is possible that the entire receptor system could fit in a one-millimeter cube and have a magnetic content of less than one ppm. As such, even discerning the parts of the brain where the information is processed presents a challenge. The most promising leads ‚Äì cryptochromes, iron-based systems, electromagnetic induction ‚Äì each have their own pros and cons. Cryptochromes have been observed in various organisms including birds and humans, but does not answer the question of night-time navigation. Iron-based systems have also been observed in birds, and if proven, could form a magnetoreceptive basis for many species including turtles. Electromagnetic induction has not been observed nor tested in non- aquatic animals. Additionally, it remains likely that two or more complementary mechanisms play a role in magnetic field detection in animals. Of course, this potential dual mechanism theory raises the question, to what degree is each method responsible for the stimulus, and how do they produce a signal in response to the low magnetic field of the Earth? Then there is the distinction of magnetic usage. Some species may only be able to sense a magnetic compass to find north and south, while others may only be able to discern between the equator and the pole. Although the ability to sense direction is important in migratory navigation, many animals also have the ability to sense small fluctuations in earth's magnetic field to compute coordinate maps with a resolution of a few kilometers or better. For a magnetic map, the receptor system would have to be able to discern tiny differences in the surrounding magnetic field to develop a sufficiently detailed magnetic map. This is not out of the question, as many animals have the ability to sense small fluctuations in the earth's magnetic field. This is not out of the question biologically, but physically has yet to be explained. For example, birds such as the homing pigeon are believed to use the magnetite in their beaks to detect magnetic signposts and thus, the magnetic sense they gain from this pathway is a possible map. Yet, it has also been suggested that homing pigeons and other birds use the visually mediated cryptochrome receptor as a compass.

He was a central figure of the Danish Golden Age and is immortalized in Danish cultural history through his music for Elves' Hill, the first true work of Danish National Romanticism and a concealed tribute to the absolute monarchy. To this day it is his version of this melody which is the definitive arrangement. During his lifetime, Kuhlau was known primarily as a concert pianist and composer of Danish opera, but was responsible for introducing many of Beethoven's works, which he greatly admired, to Copenhagen audiences. Kuhlau was a prolific composer, as evidenced by the fact that although his house burned down, destroying all of his unpublished manuscripts, he still left a legacy of more than 200 published works in most genres. Early life and education Kuhlau was born on 11 September 1786 just south of L√ºneburg in the Uelzen district of Lower Saxony (Germany). At the age of seven, he lost his right eye when he slipped on ice and fell. His father, grandfather, and uncle were military oboists. Even though Kuhlau was born to a poor family, his parents managed to pay for piano lessons. In 1802 he moved to Hamburg where he began learning the piano with scholar C.F.G Schwencke. Career In 1804, Kuhlau made his debut and began working as a concert pianist. It was around this time that he began composing songs and chamber music to earn money. Many of Kuhlau's compositions throughout his life were for the flute, though he himself did not play the instrument. In 1810, he fled to Copenhagen to avoid conscription in the Napoleonic Army, which overwhelmed the many small principalities and duchies of northern Germany. In the same year, Kuhlau published his first piano and flute compositions. Kuhlau made a living in Copenhagen as a piano teacher and composer in 1811. He was later appointed as a non-salaried musician in the Danish Court in 1812. Kuhlau eventually became a Danish citizen in 1813. Following the success of his singspiel, The Robber's Castle, Kuhlau gained a high-paying position as a singing teacher at the Royal Theater in 1816. Kuhlau's works between 1817 and 1820 failed to gain much prominence. His opera, The Magic Harp, was said to have failed due to a controversial libretto. In 1821 and 1825, Kuhlau travelled to Vienna where he befriended Ludwig van Beethoven. Beethoven's influence is evidential in Kuhlau's later works such as his singspiel, Elves' Hill, a work widely regarded as a tribute to the Danish Monarchy and an inspiring piece from the Danish Golden Age. In 1828, Kuhlau was awarded an honorary professorship. Music=Operatic works Kuhlau had his breakthrough in 1814 at the Royal Danish Theatre with R√∏verborgen (\\"The Robbers' Castle\\"), a singspiel with a libretto by Adam Oehlenschl√§ger. His next few dramatic works, including Trylleharpen (1817), Elisa (1820) and Hugo og Adelheid (1827), lacking drama, failed miserably. With Lulu from 1824 he finally once again experienced success with one of his singspiels. He also wrote music for performances of William Shakespeare's plays. In 1828 he achieved his greatest success when he wrote the music for Elverh√∏j. It won immediate popularity, especially for its overture and the final royal anthem, his setting of Kong Christian stod ved h√∏ien Mast (King Christian Stood by the Towering Mast). In the music, Kuhlau made very effective use of Danish and Swedish folk tunes. In 1976 the overture was rearranged by Danish composer Bent Fabricius-Bjerre and used as the soundtrack in a scene in the film The Olsen Gang Sees Red. The scene depicts the Olsen Gang breaking into The Royal Theater of Copenhagen, making their way through bricked up walls using explosives and other means. The whole break-in is choreographed so it corresponds directly to the music. The scene is one of the most ‚Äì if not the most ‚Äì recognized in the history of Danish film. Other works Alongside his dramatic works, Kuhlau wrote several compositions for flute and a large number of works for piano. Particularly his short pieces, sonatinas, for piano, enjoyed great popularity both in Denmark and abroad. Beethoven, whom Kuhlau knew personally, exerted the greatest influence upon his music. Kuhlau's C major Piano Concerto, Op. 7 from 1810 displays a strong influence from Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 1 in C major, written 14 years earlier. All three movements of the work are strongly reminiscent of the corresponding movements in Beethoven's work, making it a musical pastiche. In addition to the above-mentioned piano concerto were a string quartet and several works for piano that included all the current genres of the day: sonatas, sonatinas, waltzes, rondos and variations. He also created several works for strings with piano (three quartets and two quintets, and several violin sonatas), works of incidental music and several operas. However, his most-often recorded and played works are several piano sonatinas and numerous works for flute. It is because of these flute works that he was nicknamed \\"the Beethoven of the flute\\" during his lifetime.

Cymone was a bass guitarist for Prince's touring band, pre-Revolution. Cymone began a solo career in 1981. His song, \\"The Dance Electric\\" (written by Prince), reached #10 on the R&B; charts in 1985. Cymone later co-wrote and produced hit songs for other acts, including Jody Watley's \\"Looking for a New Love\\" and \\"Real Love\\". Cymone's stage name comes from a variation of his middle name, Simon. Biography=Early years Cymone was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The son of Fred Anderson, a musician, and Bernadette, a social worker, Cymone was the youngest of six children. The Anderson home soon had an additional member ‚Äì a young Prince who left his own home due to conflicts with his father. Prince's cousin Charles Smith started the band Grand Central and later invited Cymone. The band included Cymone's sister Linda and Morris Day ‚Äî they later changed their name to Champagne due to being confused with the funk band Graham Central Station. Around this same, in 1975, Pepe Willie (the former husband of another of Prince's cousins), started the funk band 94 East, with members Cymone and Prince. Career In the late 1970s, after Prince released his debut album, For You, Prince recruited Cymone as bassist for his touring band. Cymone stayed with Prince until 1981 when he quit the band over tensions with Prince. The two later resolved their issues and Cymone, managed by Owen Husney, went on to release 3 solo albums ‚Äì Livin' In The New Wave (1982), Survivin' in the 80s (1983), and AC (1985). All were out of print for a long period of time, but all three of his solo records have been remastered, and expanded with extra tracks. His most successful single ‚Äì a song written by Prince ‚Äì was \\"The Dance Electric\\" from the AC album. Cymone went on to become a record producer and is better known for producing Jody Watley (to whom he was married and shares a son). He has also produced and written songs for several other artists, including Evelyn \\"Champagne\\" King, Pebbles, Jermaine Stewart, Pretty Poison and Adam Ant. In 1988, Cymone produced three tracks and co-wrote the track \\"Under My Skin\\" for Phil Thornalley's 1988 only solo album Swamp. His song \\"Better Way\\", performed by James Ingram, featured on the Beverly Hills Cop II soundtrack released in 1987. Cymone is referenced by Brooklyn band The Hold Steady on their critically received debut album, Almost Killed Me, on track two, \\"The Swish\\". In September 2012 Cymone released a digital single, titled \\"America\\", in aid of United States President Barack Obama's re-election campaign with all proceeds from the sale of the digital single being donated to the campaign. The single is available through andrecymone.bandcamp.com, via digital download. A sneak-peek at a new song titled \\"American Dream\\" was available for a limited time for everyone who donated by purchasing \\"America\\". In 2012, Cymone confirmed he was working on a new album, bringing an end to a 27-year singing hiatus. In May 2013 Cymone released a demo on his Twitter/Facebook page called \\"My Best Friend\\", a six-minute long acoustic track he described as a tribute to his mother Bernadette Anderson. In late May 2013 Cymone appeared alongside former Revolution member Bobby Z on a web-based video chat forum co-hosted by celebrity blogger Dr. Funkenberry where he went into greater detail about the writing of the song and the hopes for his new album. In November 2013, the album, titled The Stone, became available for pre-order in various exclusive packages on the site PledgeMusic. The packages included early MP3 downloads, signed CDs and one-off personalised items. The Stone was released on February 18, 2014.

This photo shows regeneration, a tree growing out of the stump of another tree that was felled in 1962 by the remnants of Typhoon Freda. A secondary forest (or second-growth forest) is a forest or woodland area which has re-grown after a timber harvest, until a long enough period has passed so that the effects of the disturbance are no longer evident. It is distinguished from an old-growth forest (primary or primeval forest), which has not recently undergone such disruption, and complex early seral forest, as well as third-growth forests that result from harvest in second growth forests. Secondary forest regrowing after timber harvest differs from forest regrowing after natural disturbances such as fire, insect infestation, or windthrow because the dead trees remain to provide nutrients, structure, and water retention after natural disturbances. However, often after natural disturbance the timber is harvested and removed from the system, in which case the system more closely resembles secondary forest rather than complex early seral forest. Description Depending on the forest, the development of primary characteristics may take anywhere from a century to several millennia. Hardwood forests of the eastern United States, for example, can develop primary characteristics in one or two generations of trees, or 150‚Äì500 years. Often the disruption is the result of human activity, such as logging, but natural phenomena that produce the same effect are often included in the definition. Secondary forests tend to have trees closer spaced than primary forests and contain less undergrowth than primary forests. Secondary forests typically were thought to lack biodiversity compared to primary forests, however this has been challenged in recent years. Usually, secondary forests have only one canopy layer, whereas primary forests have several. Secondary forestation is common in areas where forests have been lost by the slash-and-burn method, a component of some shifting cultivation systems of agriculture. Secondary forests may also arise from forest that has been harvested heavily or over a long period of time, forest that is naturally regenerating from fire and from abandoned pastures or areas of agriculture. It takes a secondary forest typically forty to 100 years to begin to resemble the original old-growth forest; however, in some cases a secondary forest will not succeed, due to erosion or soil nutrient loss in certain tropical forests. Secondary forests re-establish by the process of succession. Openings created in the forest canopy allow sunlight to reach the forest floor. An area that has been cleared will first be colonized by pioneer species. Even though some species loss may occur with primary forest removal, a secondary forest can protect the watershed from further erosion and provides habitat. Secondary forests may also buffer edge effects around mature forest fragments and increase connectivity between them. They may also be a source of wood and other forest products. Today most of the forest of the United States, the eastern part of North America and Europe consist of secondary forest. Rainforests In the case of semi - tropical rainforests, where soil nutrient levels are characteristically low, the soil quality may be significantly diminished following the removal of primary forest. In Panama, growth of new forests from abandoned farmland exceeded loss of primary rainforest in 1990.\\"New Jungles Prompt a Debate on Rain Forests\\" article by Elisabeth Rosenthal in The New York Times January 29, 2009 However, due to the diminished quality of soil, among other factors, the presence of a significant majority of primary forest species fail to recover in these second-growth forests.

The first African-American student admitted to Clemson University after attending Iowa State University, Gantt graduated with honors in architecture, earned a master's at MIT, and established an architectural practice in Charlotte with a partner. Gantt entered local politics, where he was elected to the city council, serving from 1974 to 1983. He was elected to two terms as the first black Mayor of Charlotte from 1983 to 1987. In the 1990s, he ran twice for the United States Senate against Jesse Helms, losing both times. Life and career Harvey B. Gantt Center on opening day Gantt was born in Charleston, South Carolina to Wilhelminia and Christopher C. Gantt, a shipyard worker. He started to participate in civil rights activism in high school. In 1963, he was the first African American to be admitted to Clemson University in South Carolina.Bass, Jack and W. Scott Poole, The Palmetto State: The Making of Modern South Carolina. University of South Carolina Press, Columbia, S.C., 2009, , pp. 101-102. He received a degree in architecture with Honors from Clemson and a Master's degree in City Planning from MIT. From 1974 until 1983, Gantt served on the Charlotte City Council. He was elected to two terms as the first African-American mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina, serving in that position from 1983 to 1987. He was defeated for a third term as mayor in 1987 by Sue Myrick. He was Charlotte's last Democratic mayor until Anthony Foxx was elected in 2009. In 1990, Gantt ran for a Senate seat in North Carolina as a Democrat against the incumbent, Republican Jesse Helms. Gantt avoided the issue of race, instead attacking Helms's record on jobs, education and health care. With one and a half weeks to go, Gantt was ahead in the polls, but Helms aired a number of television commercials emphasizing Gantt's color. One, which attacked Gantt's pro- abortion stance, repeatedly rewound and replayed a soundbite from Gantt, with the image changing from color to black and white, and Gantt's face appearing darker at the end. Another advertisement, known as the White Hands ad, showed a close-up of the hands of a white person reading, then crumpling a letter, while a voice-over said \\"You needed that job, and you were the best qualified. But they had to give it to a minority because of a racial quota. Is that really fair?\\" It accused Gantt of supporting \\"Ted Kennedy's racial quota law\\".Swint (2008), p. 45 Gantt lost the election by 47% to 53%. He ran against Helms again in 1996, but he lost again with 46% of the vote. He manages a successful architectural practice, Gantt Huberman Architects, and remains active in politics. He served on the North Carolina Democratic Party Executive Council, the Democratic National Committee, and was appointed as chair of the National Capital Planning Commission in Washington, DC. In 2009, the Afro- American Cultural Center and the City of Charlotte honored Gantt by building the Harvey B. Gantt Center for African-American Arts + Culture, recognizing his contributions to the civil rights movement and as the city's first black mayor. The four-story, 46,500-square-foot building was built for $18.6 million, and is part the Levine Center for the Arts. In 2016, PBS Charlotte and UNC-TV featured Gantt in their online series, Biographical Conversations. In this series, Gantt recalls his life experiences, ranging from his attendance at Clemson University to his inauguration as Mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina. Gantt and his wife Lucinda (Brawley) Gantt, the second black student to attend Clemson, have four children: Sonja, Erika, Angela and Adam. Their daughter, Sonja Gantt, is a former news anchor at WCNC-TV in Charlotte.

It was published between 1962 and 1970 by Pa≈Ñstwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe (State Scientific Publishers, PWN) in Warsaw. The WEP contains about 82,000 entries, 12,000 illustrations, 200 color and 650 black-and-white inserted illustrations, and 120 color maps in thirteen volumes (including the Supplement). Many entries are signed, and many contain bibliographic material. The encyclopedia shows severe censorship. As is stated in the foreword, the encyclopedia is \\"based on rationalist and materialist assumptions\\" and reflects the worldview of the \\"socialist ideology\\". About 2000 authors, 1000 reviewers, and almost 100 editors were supervised by the Scientific Board appointed by the Polish Academy of Sciences (PAN) and the Ministry of Higher Education, and headed by Professor Tadeusz Kotarbi≈Ñski. The initiative to write the WEP was taken by PWN in July 1957 when it was decided that an 8-volume (later expanded to 12 volumes) universal encyclopedia would be published. Preparations began in 1957 and the actual writing started in April 1959. It took 14 months to prepare the list of entries, about 16 months to write the first volume, and then about 9 months for each next volume. Right after the twelfth volume had been published, the work on the Supplement (about five thousand updated, revised or completely new articles) began. Volumes An open volume of the encyclopedia with dates of publishing: # A - Ble, 1962 # Bli - Deo, 1963 # Dep - Franc, 1964 # Frang - Im, 1964 # In - Kons, 1965 # Kont - Mam, 1965 # Man - Nomi, 1966 # Nomo - Polsc, 1966 # Polska - Robe, 1967; begins with an extensive 224-page long article about Poland, subdivided into 35 sections. # Robi - Step, 1967 # Ster - Urz, 1968 # Usa - ≈ª, 1969 # Supplement, 1970 Controversy Volume 8 includes an article entitled \\"Hitlerite concentration camps\\" (Obozy koncentracyjne hitlerowskie) which caused much controversy. The major objections were that: * it did not show that concentration camps were not the only tool of extermination used by the Nazis (along with penal camps, prisons, ghettos, labor camps, POW camps, etc.); * it did not show the difference in the role of concentration camps prior to and after the German invasion on Poland; * it distorted the image of the martyrdom of the Polish and other nations; * it ignored the existence of German death camps localized outside Poland, i.e. in Germany, Austria, the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and other German-occupied countries. As the result, the editorial team was \\"renewed\\" and a new, revised article, this time entitled \\"Hitlerite camps\\" (Obozy hitlerowskie), was added as an inset to Volume 11, and later included in the Supplement.

She was born in Bessarabia, a province in Tsarist Russia. Sometime after the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, her family moved to Tel Aviv, in what was then Palestine. Her father, Aviv Ratner, a wealthy Jewish land-owner, had taught her to play chess when she was 9 years old. Because of her natural ability, she started playing in tournaments in Tel Aviv and developed into a strong player. In 1930, she moved to Boston and became a U.S. citizen, aged 21. There she met and married her cousin, an attorney named Abraham S. Karff (15 March 1901 - 16 February 1995). The marriage was brief and, though she never remarried, her long-time romantic relationship with Edward Lasker (a five-time U.S. Chess Open champion) was never a secret. She played in three Women's World Chess Championships: 1937 Stockholm, playing for Palestine and placing sixth (won by Vera Menchik); 1939 Buenos Aires, playing for the U.S. and placing 5th (also won by Menchik); 1949 Moscow, playing for the U.S. (won by Lyudmila Rudenko). When FIDE established titles in 1950, Mona May Karff was one of four American women to receive the title of International Woman Master. Karff, along with Gisela Kahn Gresser and Mary Bain, dominated U.S. women's chess in the 1940s and early 1950s. Mona May Karff won her first U.S. Women's Chess Champion title against Adele Rivero in 1938. She competed and won the title six more times, in 1941, 1943, 1946, 1948 (sharing it with Gresser), 1953 and in 1974 (at age 66). She also won four consecutive U.S. Open titles. Karff was also a stock investor who was worth a small fortune. She spoke eight languages fluently and traveled extensively. As an art lover, she spent a good portion of her fortune on modern art. She died in Manhattan on January 10, 1998.

He was the Chief Technical Officer at Williams Grand Prix Engineering, from 2013 until 2016 having previously worked at the Benetton, Renault and Virgin Formula One teams. He is currently the Chief Technical Officer of Formula 1. Early life and education Symonds was born in Bedford, England and educated at Gresham's School in Holt, Norfolk, after which he studied at Oxford Polytechnic and Cranfield University, where he gained a Masters in aerodynamics. Career After starting his career in lower motor sport categories, he joined Toleman in the early 1980s. As Toleman grew, it was taken over to become Benetton Formula, and was subsequently sold and renamed Renault F1. Symonds remained throughout this entire period with the team, working his way through the technical ranks. Symonds served as an engineer for many of the team's drivers, including Alessandro Nannini and Teo Fabi. After a brief move to the abortive Reynard F1 project with then-chief designer Rory Byrne in 1991, in the mid-1990s he was Michael Schumacher's race engineer while also assuming the role of Head of Research and Development. Symonds remained with the team when Schumacher departed to Ferrari in 1996. When Ross Brawn was also lured to Ferrari, Symonds became the team's Technical Director. When Mike Gascoyne joined Benetton in 2001, Symonds was promoted to Executive Director of Engineering, a post which he retained though the transition to Renault ownership in 2002. Singapore crash In July 2009, Nelson Piquet, Jr. claimed Symonds asked him to deliberately crash at the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix to manufacture a situation which would assist team-mate Fernando Alonso to win the race. The ING Renault F1 Team released a statement on 16 September 2009 stating that Symonds was no longer part of the team. Symonds was subsequently suspended from F1 events for 5 years after expressing his \\"eternal regret and shame\\" to the FIA World Motor Sport Council.http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2009/9/9954.html However, his ban was overturned by the French Tribunal de Grande Instance on 5 January 2010, and he was also paid ‚Ç¨5,000 in compensation. In April, he and Briatore reached an out-of-court settlement with the FIA where he could return to F1 in 2013 but may be a consultant to a current Formula 1 team in the meantime. 2009‚Äì2013 In , Symonds returned to F1 as a consultant for the Virgin Racing (later Manor F1) team to conduct a thorough overview of its operation, following a disappointing start to its second season in the sport. Shortly afterwards, the team parted company with existing technical director Nick Wirth. Symonds is believed by many to have effectively taken Wirth's place, although he was still only a consultant due to the terms of his ban. Symonds had a column in the F1 Racing magazine, and serves on the committee for the MSc in Motorsport Engineering and Management at Cranfield University. Williams F1 In July 2013 it was announced that Symonds had been appointed as Chief Technical Officer to the Williams F1 Team, replacing the immediately departed Mike Coughlan.url= Williams confirmed in December 2016 that Symonds would be leaving upon the expiration of his contract at the end of the year.

A member of the Leading Hotels of the World marketing group, the Ritz Paris is ranked among the most luxurious hotels in the world. The hotel was founded in 1898 by the Swiss hotelier C√©sar Ritz in collaboration with the French chef Auguste Escoffier. The hotel was constructed behind the fa√ßade of an eighteenth-century town house. It was among the first hotels in Europe to provide an en suite bathroom, electricity, and a telephone for each room. It quickly established a reputation for luxury and attracted a clientele that included royalty, politicians, writers, film stars, and singers. Several of its suites are named in honour of famous guests of the hotel including Coco Chanel, and the cocktail lounge Bar Hemingway pays tribute to writer Ernest Hemingway. Beginning in 2012, the 159-room hotel underwent a four-year, multimillion-euro renovation, reopening on 6 June 2016. While the hotel has not applied for the 'Palace' distinction from the French ministry of economy, industry and employment, its Suite Imp√©riale has been listed by the French government as a national monument. Because of its status as a symbol of high society and luxury, the hotel is featured in many notable works of fiction including novels (F. Scott Fitzgerald's Tender Is The Night and Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises), a play (No√´l Coward's play Semi-Monde), and films (Billy Wilder's 1957 comedy Love in the Afternoon and William Wyler's 1966 comedy How to Steal a Million). Background and history C√©sar Ritz The Place Vend√¥me was started by the Marquis de Louvois and abandoned due to a lack of funds. After Louvois' death the site was bought by king Louis XIV but finances ran low and the project was bought and completed by John Law. Lot number 15, Place Vend√¥me site was purchased in 1705 by Antoine Bitaut de Vaill√©, advisor to the Grand Council, nominee of Jeanne Baillet de La Cour, widow of Nicolas Baillet de La Cour and acting on behalf of his daughter Anne. Jeanne bequeathed it in 1710 to her daughter, Anne, wife of Duke Antoine de Gramont. Anne, a chambermaid to the first doctor of Louis XIV, Daquin, then to Louis Sanguin, Marquis de Livry, married the Duke Antoine Charles IV of Gramont who left his name to the h√¥tel particulier H√¥tel de Gramont which was built on the site. In 1721, the Duchesse de Gramont, who had become a widow, sold it to Daniel Fran√ßois de Gelas of Voisin (1686-1762), knight of Amber and count of Lautrec, who lived there for thirty years. It was sold in 1750 to Charles de la Villette, treasurer of the extraordinary wars, who rented it to the Prince of Andorra, Spanish ambassador. From 1775 it belonged to Claude Darras, secretary of the king, and then was occupied from 1788 by the Direction of the liquidation of the public debt and then from 1792 by the Mortgage credit The fa√ßade was designed by the royal architect Jules Hardouin Mansart. In 1854 it was acquired by the P√©reire brothers, who made it the head office of their Cr√©dit Mobilier financial institution. In 1888, the Swiss hotelier C√©sar Ritz and the French chef Auguste Escoffier opened a restaurant in Baden-Baden, and the two were then invited to London by Richard D'Oyly Carte to become the first manager and chef of the Savoy Hotel, positions they held from 1889 until 1897.Ashburner, F. \\"Escoffier, Georges Auguste (1846‚Äì1935)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, May 2006. Retrieved 17 September 2009 The Savoy under Ritz was an immediate success, attracting a distinguished and moneyed clientele, headed by the Prince of Wales. In 1897, Ritz and Escoffier were both dismissed from the Savoy, when Ritz was implicated in the disappearance of over ¬£3400 worth of wine and spirits.Brigid, Allen. \\"Ritz, C√©sar Jean (1850‚Äì1918)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, September 2004; online edition, May 2006. Retrieved 18 September 2009 Before their dismissal, customers at the Savoy had reportedly urged them to open a hotel in Paris. Aided by Alexandre Marnier-Lapostolle, Ritz purchased the palace and transformed the former H√¥tel de Gramont building into a 210-room hotel. He stated that his purpose for the hotel was to provide his rich clientele with \\"all the refinement that a prince could desire in his own home.\\" He engaged the architect Charles Mew√®s to update the original 1705 structure. Ritz's innovative standards of hygiene demanded a bathroom for every suite, the maximum possible amount of sunlight, and the minimum of curtains and other hangings.Brigid Allen, 'Ritz, C√©sar Jean (1850‚Äì1918)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2006 accessed 3 July 2012 At the same time he furnished the hotel with all the old-fashioned appeal of an English or French gentleman's house, in order to make clients feel at home. The hotel opened on 1 June 1898 to a \\"glittering reception\\". Together with the culinary talents of his junior partner Escoffier, Ritz made the hotel synonymous with opulence, service, and fine dining, as embodied in the term \\"ritzy.\\" It immediately became fashionable with Parisian socialites, hosting many prestigious personalities over the years, such as Marcel Proust, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, King Edward VII, and the couturier Coco Chanel, who made the Ritz her home for more than thirty years. Many of the suites in the hotel are named after their famous patrons. Hemingway once said, \\"When in Paris the only reason not to stay at the Ritz is if you can't afford it\\". Garden terrace shown in The dinner in the hotel Ritz in Paris by Pierre-Georges Jeanniot, 1904 In 1904 and 1908, the Ritz garden caf√© was painted by the Swiss artist, Pierre-Georges Jeanniot. Proust wrote parts of Remembrance of Things Past here from around 1909. The building was extended in 1910, and C√©sar Ritz died in 1918, succeeded by his son, Charles Ritz. Queen Marie of Romania stayed at the Ritz Hotel with her two eldest daughters, Elisabeth (of Greece) and Maria (of Yugoslavia) in 1919 while campaigning for Greater Romania at the Paris Peace Conference. Many other prominent royal figures and heads of state slept and dined at the hotel over the years. Edward VII reportedly once got stuck in a too-narrow bathtub with his lover at the hotel. August Escoffier died in 1935. After the death of Charles Ritz in 1976, the hotel went into a period of slow decline. As it lost its luster, its clientele diminished, and for the first time in its existence it began to lose money. It was rescued, however, in 1979 by an Egyptian businessman, Mohamed Al-Fayed, who purchased the hotel for $20 million and installed a new managing director, Frank Klein. Klein in turn put Guy Legay, the former chef of the three-star Ledoyen, in charge of the kitchen. Al-Fayed renovated it completely over several years without stopping its operation; this was achieved by annexing two town houses, joined by an arcade with many of Paris's leading boutiques. The renovation of the hotel was headed by the architect Bernard Gaucherel from 1980 to 1987. The entire ten- year renovation cost a total of $250 million. The restaurants were given a new look, and a swimming pool, health club, and spas were created in the basement. The Little Bar was renamed the Hemingway Bar. In 1988 the Ritz-Escoffier School of French Gastronomy was established in honour of Auguste Escoffier. On 1 August 2012, the Ritz closed for the first time in its history for an extensive restoration. It was scheduled to reopen in late 2015, but this date was later changed to March 2016. At 07:00 local time on 19 January 2016, a major fire broke out in the roof of the building. Fifteen fire engines and 60 firefighters attended. The Ritz reopened on 6 June 2016 after a major four- year, multimillion-dollar renovation. In the 21st century, the Ritz is ranked among the most luxurious hotel in the world and the most expensive in Paris. It is referred to by some as the best hotel in Europe and one of the world's most famous hotels. It is one of \\"The Leading Hotels of the World\\". Entrance, 2009 Noteworthy historical occurrences During the summer of 1940, the Luftwaffe, the air forces of Nazi Germany during the Second World War, set up their headquarters at the Ritz, with their chief Hermann G√∂ring. Ernest Hemingway, who stayed at the hotel many times after World War II, was there when he learned his wife wanted a divorce. He reacted to the news by throwing her photo into a Ritz toilet and then shooting the photo and the toilet with his pistol. On 31 August 1997, Diana, Princess of Wales and Al-Fayed's son Dodi Al-Fayed, and their chauffeur Henri Paul, dined in the Imperial Suite of the hotel before leaving the hotel with bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones, only to have a fatal car accident in the Pont de l'Alma underpass. During 10 January 2018 five men stole millions of euros of jewellery from within the hotel, three were subsequently caught before escaping.Paris: plus de 4 millions d' euros voles lors d'un braquage au Ritz Le Point Accessed 10 January 2018 Architecture The H√¥tel Ritz Paris, looking north The palace and the square are masterpieces of classical architecture from the end of the reign of Louis XIV. The fa√ßade was designed by the royal architect Mansart in the late 17th century before the plot was bought and construction began in 1705. The H√¥tel Ritz comprises the Vend√¥me and the Cambon buildings with rooms overlooking the Place Vend√¥me, and, on the opposite side, the hotel's garden. The Ritz was among the first hotels in Europe to provide a bathroom en suite, a telephone and electricity for each room. The H√¥tel Ritz Paris is 4 floors high, including the mansard roof, and as of 2011 offers 159 rooms, a two-Michelin- starred restaurant, two bars and a casual dining restaurant. Rooms and suites Bath/shower and peach-coloured towel In the 1970s a travel publication Holiday wrote, \\"practically every royal head of state has snoozed under down quilts on the finest linen sheets, beneath fifteen-foot-high () ceilings in rooms looking out, through huge double windows, on the elegant Place Vend√¥me.\\" Frommer's, which calls the Ritz \\"Europe's greatest hotel\\", describes the furnishings as follows, \\"the public salons are furnished with museum-calibre antiques. Each guest room is uniquely decorated, most with Louis XIV or Louis XV reproductions; all have fine rugs, marble fireplaces, tapestries, brass beds, and more. Ever since Edward VII got stuck in a too- narrow bathtub with his lover, the tubs at the Ritz have been deep and big.\\" The bathrooms contain unique golden swan taps, and peach-coloured towels and robes, believed to be more flattering than white to a woman's complexion. The Ritz may be the most expensive hotel in Paris, employing a staff of over 600, the rooms as of May 2017 started at ‚Ç¨1,100 a night. Suites start at ‚Ç¨3,500 and up to ‚Ç¨20,000 a night for the most lavish ones (Suite Imp√©riale being the most expensive). These finest suites are known as the \\"Prestige suites\\", ten in total, which according to the Ritz are \\"a world for aesthetes where 18th century panelling echoes allegorical ceilings, old masters and priceless antique furniture. Each suite is unique and each seems to still breathe the spirit of the illustrious guests who once stayed there.\\" The Vend√¥me Suite is one of the most spacious of the hotel, containing Louis XIV furnishings, with a red and ivory theme and grand windows overlooking the square. The C√©sar Ritz Suite overlooks the square and contains Louis XV furniture and a portrait of Ritz himself. The room is decorated in shades of green and light yellow with a canopied bed in one room and silk floral pattern in the second. The doors of the sitting room of the suite are edged in gold leaf. The Elton John Suite, decorated in strawberry pink and cream, contains two bedrooms, a thick pink carpet and attic windows. John reportedly hired the entire floor for his 42nd birthday. The Windsor Suite contains tapestries and gilded mouldings and portraits of the Duke (Edward VIII) and Duchess of Windsor. They are decorated with Louis XVI furniture and colours such as almond green, salmon and pearl grey. The master bedroom is decorated in pearl grey in a shade which the Ritz calls \\"Wallis blue\\", a favourite of Wallis, Duchess of Windsor. The Coco Chanel Suite where Coco Chanel lived for some 35 years consists of two bedrooms and a living room and features Coromandel lacquers, Chinese furniture, baroque mirrors and oversized sofas with quilting created by Grande Mademoiselle. =Imperial Suite= The Imperial Suite (Suite Imp√©riale) is the finest suite of the hotel, and is listed as a National Monument of France in its own right. The Imperial Suite is located on the first floor and consists of two bedrooms, a grand salon, and a dining room. The suite features ceilings, great chandeliers and windows overlooking the Place Vend√¥me, a massive long gold framed Baroque mirror between the windows, red and gold upholstery and a four-poster bed said to be identical to that in Marie Antoinette's bedroom in the Palace of Versailles. The other bedroom is in the style of Louis XVI, with a baldachin bed and columns. The suite is lavishly decorated in French art, bas-reliefs and 18th-century panelling which is protected under the suite's historic monument status. The bathroom is a former boudoir overlooking the Vend√¥me garden, with 18th-century panelling and a Jacuzzi bath and steam-bath shower and has its own plasma television and cosmetics fridge, juxtaposing old French tradition with the modernity of the 21st century. As well as facilities such as a DVD player, high-speed internet, and fax, the suite features a Porsche Design kitchenette with CHROMA knives near the salon and has its own small personal wine cellar filled with a variety of French wines. Over the years the suite has hosted some of the world's most prestigious guests from the Shah of Iran to George H. W. Bush. The suite was Hermann G√∂ring's choice of residence during the Second World War and it was where Diana, Princess of Wales and Dodi Al-Fayed ate their last meal. The World Travel Awards of 2007 selected the Imperial Suite as \\"Europe's Leading Suite\\". Restaurant and barsL'Espadon= Although there was necessarily a hotel restaurant from the inception of the Ritz, the current hotel restaurant, L'Espadon (The Swordfish) was established in 1956 by Charles Ritz. He was a keen fishing enthusiast so named the restaurant after a fish. The restaurant is inspired by the legendary first chef of the hotel, Auguste Escoffier, serving \\"traditional French culinary style with contemporary overtones\\". The cuisine was by the award-winning chef Michel Roth, the ninth head chef of the hotel; the restaurant was awarded a second star by the 2009 edition of the influential Michelin Red Guide. He was the executive chef of the restaurant until its closing on 1 August 2012 for a complete renovation. The head chef was formerly Guy Legay, cited as one of Paris's greatest chefs, who had served from at least 1986 to beyond 1999. In 1999, Esquire magazine wrote, \\"the dining room, L'Espadon, down the long corridor of mirrors and display cases, has a glittering Regency formality that seems to swirl around you, and it's easy enough to imagine Hemingway sitting down with Dietrich to a dish of chef Guy Legay's buttery scrambled eggs...\\" The restaurant decor is described as \\"opulent with trompe l‚Äôoeil ceilings, swagged drapes, and views into the garden.\\" The courtyard garden is rich in greenery and contains several statues and a fountain. The hotel hires five or so florists to provide fresh flowers. =Bars= The hotel has several bars, namely the Ritz Bar, Bar Vend√¥me, Bar Hemingway and the Pool Bar. The Ritz Bar, just inside the Rue Cambon entrance on the left, gained a reputation over the years for its glamorous cocktail parties and the unique bartending skills of Frank Meier, head barman from 1921 until his death in 1947. One of his best-known cocktails was the potent \\"Rainbow\\", consisting of anisette, mint, yellow chartreuse, cherry brandy, k√ºmmel, green chartreuse and cognac. The Ritz Bar is designed in the Victorian style with red-velvet armchairs and bar furnishings, a marble fireplace and historic portraits. The Ritz Bar may have been the world's first hotel bar. Bar Hemingway was the favourite bar of Ernest Hemingway and is said by some to be the birthplace of the Bloody Mary cocktail which was invented for him. However, the claim is disputed as Fernand Petiot claimed to have invented the drink in 1921 while working at Harry's New York Bar, a frequent Paris hangout for Hemingway and other American expatriates, rather than in the bar in the Ritz itself.Andrew MacElhone and Duncan MacElhone: Harry's ABC of Mixing Cocktails, page 35. , Souvenir Press, 1986, 1996. The bar has been restored to its original appearance, with rich wood panelling and leather upholstery and has 25 original photographs on the walls taken by the author of places and people that inspired him. Bar Vend√¥me is very popular with wealthy Parisians for afternoon tea and contains wood furnishings and a grand piano. During the summer months the doors are opened out onto the garden and terrace. Ritz-Escoffier School The hotel at night, looking west The Ritz- Escoffier School of French Gastronomy was established in 1988 in honour of Georges-Auguste Escoffier. The ethos of the school is based on Escoffier's words, \\"Good cuisine is the foundation of true happiness.\\" This school is accessed through an entrance in the back of the hotel and offers training courses and workshops for amateur and professional cooks. Ritz Health Club The Ritz Health Club contains a swimming pool, the largest in all of the Parisian hotel palaces and billed by the Ritz as \\"the finest indoor pool in Paris\\". The pool's construction was inspired by the baths of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome and features reliefs on the ceilings and jet streams and underwater sounds in the pool. The health club boasts of of \\"hi-tech facilities\\" and offers a range of health treatments, from reflexology to Swedish massage and shiatsu. In fiction Because of its status as a symbol of wealth and luxury, the hotel has featured in many notable works of fiction. Novels and plays Many novels of the Lost Generation feature scenes in the Ritz, such as F. Scott Fitzgerald's Tender Is The Night and Ernest Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises. No√´l Coward's play Semi-Monde is perhaps the most notable work covering the hotel in detail, following the escapades of an extravagant, promiscuous fictional Paris elite between 1924 and 1926. In the Bret Easton Ellis novel Glamorama, a group of supermodels turned terrorists plant a home-made bomb in the Ritz, resulting in its destruction. In The Da Vinci Code, the protagonist, Robert Langdon, stays at the hotel while in Paris, as do Andrea Sachs and Miranda Priestly in Lauren Weisberger's The Devil Wears Prada. The final chapter of Ian Fleming's James Bond novel From Russia, with Love is set at the hotel. The villain, Rosa Klebb, stays in room 602 and engages in a battle with Bond which results in her death. In Julian Fellowes' novel Snobs (2004), those attending Earl Broughton's pre-marriage bachelor party are accommodated at the Ritz. Cinema The hotel has featured in several films, three of which starred Audrey Hepburn. In Stanley Donen's 1957 film Funny Face, Kay Thompson dances in the Ritz's entry driveway and in front of the hotel, accompanied by a group of dancers dressed as Ritz bellhops during the Bonjour, Paris! number. In Billy Wilder's 1957 comedy Love in the Afternoon, Hepburn initiates her romance with Gary Cooper in his suite in the hotel and much of the film is set there. The hotel is again seen in the 1966 movie How to Steal a Million, with a romantic scene between Hepburn and Peter O'Toole in the hotel's bar in which Hepburn wears an iconic Givenchy black lace eyemask and matching cocktail dress. In the Indian film Jhoom Barabar Jhoom, Abhishek Bachchan meets his fictional love (played by Lara Dutta) at Hotel Ritz.

The state highway runs from the North Carolina state line in Suffolk north to U.S. Route 17, US 258, and SR 143 in Newport News. The southernmost part of SR 32 connects Suffolk with the Albemarle Region of North Carolina via North Carolina Highway 32 (NC 32). The remainder of SR 32 runs concurrently with at least one other state or U.S. Highway between Suffolk and Newport News, including US 13, SR 10, US 258, and US 17. The last two highways run together with SR 32 on the James River Bridge. Route description View north near the south end of SR 32 at NC 32 at the North Carolina state line in Suffolk SR 32 begins at the North Carolina state line in a rural portion of the city of Suffolk. The border crossing, from which the highway continues south as NC 32 (Virginia Road), is a short distance west of Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge and much closer to the North Carolina community of Corapeake than the developed portion of Suffolk. SR 32 heads north as two-lane Carolina Road, which the highway follows to its intersection with US 13 (Whaleyville Boulevard) next to Suffolk Municipal Airport. SR 32 and US 13 continue north along Carolina Road, now a four-lane divided highway, to a partial interchange with the southwestern end of the Suffolk Bypass. US 13 exits onto the bypass toward a junction with US 58 while US 13 Business joins SR 32 as Carolina Road reduces to a five-lane road with center turn lane. The two highways reduce to a four-lane undivided highway as they intersect a Norfolk Southern Railway's Franklin District south of downtown Suffolk. SR 32 and US 13 Business cross over Norfolk Southern Railway's Norfolk District at the southern edge of downtown Suffolk. At their intersection with SR 337 (Washington Street), SR 10 begins and joins SR 32 and US 13 Business north as Main Street through downtown Suffolk. The highways intersect CSX's Portsmouth Subdivision railroad line before reaching US 58 Business (Constance Road), where US 13 Business turns east and US 460 Business joins SR 32 and SR 10. The three highways cross the Nansemond River and pass through a commercial area as a five-lane road with center turn lane. In the community of Elephant Fork, US 460 Business splits northwest as Pruden Boulevard while SR 32 and SR 10 continue north on Godwin Boulevard. The state highways expand to a four-lane divided highway just south of their partial cloverleaf interchange with the Suffolk Bypass, which carries US 13, US 58, and US 460 around the north side of Suffolk. SR 32 and SR 10 pass Sentara Obici Memorial Hospital and through a commercial area before entering farmland. The two highways reduce to two lanes just before crossing the Western Branch of the Nansemond River. SR 32 and SR 10 intersect SR 125 (Kings Highway) in the community of Chuckatuck before leaving Suffolk and entering Isle of Wight County, where the highway expands to a four-lane divided highway named Benns Church Boulevard. The two state highways diverge at Benns Church, where SR 32 joins US 258 on Brewers Neck Boulevard. The two highways head east through Carrollton to an intersection with US 17 (Carrollton Boulevard). SR 32, US 17, and US 258 head northeast to cross the James River on the James River Bridge. Just after entering the city of Newport News, the three highways meet US 60 (Warwick Boulevard) at a partial cloverleaf interchange. Just east of there, the highways cross over CSX's Peninsula Subdivision and SR 32 reaches its eastern terminus at SR 143 (Jefferson Avenue). US 17 turns north onto Jefferson Avenue toward Yorktown while US 258 continues east on Mercury Boulevard toward Hampton.

History=Background : before 1989 The history of the evolution of Siemens Plessey division traces to 1988, when the UK regulatory authorities rejected a full merger between the British-based industrial conglomerate - General Electric Company plc (GEC), and the Plessey company - a historic British-based international electronics, defence and telecommunications company founded in 1917. Plessey was at the time the second largest defence electronics contractor to the Ministry of Defence and the largest supplier of traffic control equipment. As a solution, GEC and Plessey merged their communications businesses the same year to form GEC Plessey Telecommunications (GPT).  Acquisition of Plessey, and Siemens Plessey : 1989-1997 In 1989, GEC and Siemens AG set up a joint holding company, GEC Siemens plc, to launch a hostile takeover of Plessey, which they succeeded. Most of Plessey‚Äôs assets were divided between the companies (see : Plessey#Break-up of the business); except the 1988 founded GEC-Plessey joint venture - GPT, which was converted to a '60/40 GEC/Siemens joint venture'. The division of Plessey between these two partners meant the deal met with little regulatory opposition. Siemens acquired Plessey's radar systems, defence systems and traffic control businesses. The defence electronics operations became Siemens Plessey Systems (commonly referred to as Siemens Plessey) and Siemens Plessey Electronics Systems (Australia). In 1997, Siemens came to an agreement with British Aerospace and DaimlerChrysler Aerospace AG (DASA) for the takeover of its defence electronics unit. BAe acquired the Siemens Plessey's defence businesses in UK, while DASA acquired the German part of the operations. Subsequent history : 1997 - to date BAe acquired part, were eventually amalgamated into BAE Systems - formed by the 1999 merger of BAe and Marconi Electronic Systems (MES). The DASA acquired assets became part of EADS in July 2000 when DASA merged with the French A√©rospatiale-Matra and Construcciones Aeron√°uticas SA (CASA) of Spain. Siemens Traffic Controls continues to operate as a unit of Siemens.

The IHY will focus on advancements in all aspects of the heliosphere and its interaction with the interstellar medium. This effort culminates in the \\"International Heliophysical Year\\" (IHY) in 2007-2008. The IHY concluded in February, 2009, but was largely continued via the International Space Weather Initiative (ISWI) The term \\"Heliophysical\\" was coined to refer specifically to this activity of studying the interconnectedness of the entire solar-heliospheric-planetary system. It is a broadening of the concept \\"geophysical,\\" extending the connections from the Earth to the Sun & interplanetary space. On the 50th anniversary of the International Geophysical Year, the 2007 IHY activities will build on the success of IGY 1957 by continuing its legacy of system-sides studies of the extended heliophysical domain. History The IHY 2007 has been planned to coincide with the fiftieth anniversary of the International Geophysical Year (IGY) in 1957-1958, one of the most successful international science programs of all time. The IGY was a broad-based and all-encompassing effort to push the frontiers of geophysics and resulted in tremendous progress in space physics, Sun-Earth connections, planetary science and the heliosphere in general. The tradition of international science years began almost 125 years ago with the first International Polar Year and international scientific studies of global processes at the North Pole in 1882-1883. The IHY has received substantial support from the United Nations, and various space agencies around the world. Objectives The IHY has three primary objectives: * Advancing our Understanding of the Heliophysical Processes that Govern the Sun, Earth and Heliosphere * Continuing the tradition of international research and advancing the legacy on the 50th anniversary of the International Geophysical Year * Demonstrating the Beauty, Relevance and Significance of Space and Earth Science to the World Science Goals The IHY team has also identified the following science goals for 2007-2008: # Develop the basic science of heliophysics through cross-disciplinary studies of universal processes. # Determine the response of terrestrial and planetary magnetospheres and atmospheres to external drivers. # Promote research on the Sun-heliosphere system outward to the local interstellar medium - the new frontier. # Foster international scientific cooperation in the study of heliophysical phenomena now and in the future # Communicate unique IHY results to the scientific community and the general public See also *Magnetic Data Acquisition System (MAGDAS) *Sun-Earth Day External links * IHY Home Page: http://ihy2007.org * eGY Home Page: https://web.archive.org/web/20130828174005/http://egy.org/index.php * IPY Home Page: http://www.ipy.org * IYPE Home Page: http://yearofplanetearth.org * IHY Japan Home Page: https://web.archive.org/web/20070929103220/http://www2.nict.go.jp/y/y223/sept/IHY/IHY-e.html * MARP Malaysian Home Page: https://web.archive.org/web/20080908072514/http://www.myantarctica.com.my/aboutMARP.htm * QuakeFinder Home Page: http://www.quakefinder.com/ Category:2007 in science Category:2008 in science Category:NASA programs Category:Sun Category:United Nations observances Category:Space science ","title":"International Heliophysical Year"},{"id":"1506525","text":"Agudas Israel may refer to: *Agudas Israel (Latvia), a political party in Latvia during the 1920s and 1930s *World Agudath Israel, the political arm of Ashkenazi Haredi Judaism *Agudat Yisrael, a political party representing the ultra-Orthodox population of Israel *Agudath Israel of America, a Haredi Jewish communal organization in the United States *Agudas Israel Housing Association, a British housing association ","title":"Agudas Israel"},{"id":"1506531","text":"Rasmus may refer to:  People  * Rasmus (given name) * Rasmus (surname)  Arts and entertainment  * The Rasmus, a Finnish rock band formerly called Rasmus ** The Rasmus (album), a self-titled studio album by the Finnish band * the title character of Rasmus Klump, a Danish comic strip series * Rasmus, a character in books by Swedish author Astrid Lindgren See also *Rasmussen (\\"Rasmus' Son\\"), family name derived from \\"Rasmus\\" *Erasmus (disambiguation) * * ","title":"Rasmus"},{"id":"1506553","text":"Wilde Beast is a wooden roller coaster located at Canada's Wonderland, in Vaughan, Ontario, Canada. It was originally named \\"Wilde Beast\\", from 1981‚Äì1996, when it was renamed to \\"Wild Beast\\" in 1997. The ride was reverted to its original name in 2019.https://www.canadaswonderland.com/play/rides/wilde-beast It is one of the four roller coasters that debuted with the park in 1981, and is one of two wooden coasters at Canada's Wonderland modelled after a ride at Coney Island amusement park in Cincinnati, Ohio (specifically, Wildcat); the other is the Mighty Canadian Minebuster. The ride's fan curve was rebuilt in 1998. History The ride is a double out-and-back coaster encompassing a figure 8 design. The ride was designed by Curtis D. Summers but is based on the original Coney Island Wildcat designed by Herbert Schmeck. It was constructed in-house under the direction of Summers. The coaster was not built by PTC despite a plaque at the operator's booth and several published reports that claim it was. PTC stopped building coasters in 1979.Rutherford, Scott. The American Roller Coaster, MBI Publishing, 2000, p. 12 It is likely however, that the construction crew consisted of workers who had previously built coasters for PTC. The two 28-passenger trains were supplied by the Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters. Unlike the three-row PTC trains on Mighty Canadian Minebuster, Wilde Beast utilizes shorter two-row cars that are designed to better negotiate turns. Curtis D. Summers continued to use this design at other Taft-owned parks including Kings Dominion in Virginia where the coaster, which opened in 1982, is known as Grizzly. Though similar in layout, the ride was tempered when reproduced as Bush Beast at Wonderland Sydney in 1985 and at California's Great America as Grizzly in 1986. The coaster was featured in the Fraggle Rock episode \\"The Thirty-Minute Work Week\\", where Uncle Travelling Matt took a ride on it, as he mistook it for a form of transportation. Puppeteer Dave Goelz has a cameo in the scene as the man next to Matt. In 2015, the track was partially reconstructed after the first hill to create a smoother ride experience.

The population in 2011 was 10,537,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 805.46 km¬≤.Eurostat History Early construction in Montalegre date back 3500‚Äì4000 years when early inhabitants, around the villages of Mourela, Veiga and Vila da Ponte, buried their dead in funeral mounds. Vestiges of this culture predominate the region, and suggest that settlements have been ongoing since the Metal Ages. Celt colonies began to appear afterward, constructing castros in many of the places that developed into formal settlements. With the arrival of the Romans, bridges and formal roads began to appear, while many of the castros began to be converted into Roman encampments, later the nuclei of formalized settlements. Remains of the Roman civitas are still common: Praesidium (in Vila da Ponte, popularly known as Sabaraz) and Caladunum (in Cervos). Although there were no overt indications that the Moors settled in this region, although oral tradition inferred as much. With the establishment of the Christian kingdom of Portugal, Afonso Henriques donated portions of the land for charitable hospices (Salto), hospitals (Vilar de Perdizes and Dornelas) or monasteries (Pit√µes). Owing to its location, on the border with Galiza, defense fortifications were constructed, including the Castles of Ger√™s and Piconha, and later in Portelo and the village of Montalegre. A lighthouse was also constructed in Tour√©m, likely by King Sancho in 1187, since he was the master of the Terras da Piconha region. It was only in September 1273 that King Afonso III bestowed on the citizens a foral (charter), founding the town of Montalegre and making the local sheriff the master of the Terras de Barroso. The foral was later confirmed by King Denis in 1289, and renewed by Afonso IV (in 1340), John II (in 1491), and Manuel (in 1515).The 1515 foral, not only renewed the town charter, but also provided for the upgrade of the lighthouse. After the Portuguese Interregnum, during the reign of John I, the Terras de Barroso were offered as a gift to Nuno √Ålvares Pereira for his support. In 1809, French troops had problems in the region, during the Peninsular Wars, fighting off the Barros√µes, in Misarela. On 6 November 1836, the municipality of Montalegre was divided, in order to create the municipality of Boticas. In course, the parishes of Vilar de Vacas was lost to the neighbouring municipality of Vieira do Minho, and later the parish of Couto Misto de Santiago de Rubi√°s, was also de-annexed. Contemporary history of the municipality has been marked by growing emigration, the result of the lack of economic recourse and the abandonment of traditional activities. The institutionalization of local government permitted a revitalization in the municipality, after the Carnation Revolution, which saw a growth in tertiary activities. Geography The Alto Rabag√£o Dam and reservoir, central to four parishes of the municipality Montalegre is one of the two municipalities that compose the region of Barroso. The Peneda-Ger√™s National Park comprises 26,26% of its area (211,74 km¬≤ out of a total 806,19 km¬≤ belonging to that park).

Still [Abraham Polonsky has] written his story with such flavor and such slashing fidelity to the cold and greedy nature of the fight game, and Robert Rossen has directed it with such an honest regard for human feelings and with such a searching and seeing camera, that any possible resemblance to other fight yarns, living or dead, may be gratefully allowed.\\"Crowther, Bosley. The New York Times, film review, \\"Exciting Story of Prizefighting, Starring John Garfield, at Globe\\", November 10, 1947. Accessed: July 16, 2013. Film critic Dennis Schwartz discussed that the film had a definite sociopolitical point of view and praised Garfield's work. He, wrote, \\"Robert Rossen's Body and Soul becomes more than a boxing and film noir tale, as screenwriter Abraham Polonsky makes this into a socialist morality drama where the pursuit of money becomes the focus that derails the common man in his quest for success ... Garfield is seen as a victim of the ruthless capitalistic system that fixes everything including athletic events, as the little guy is always at the mercy of the big operator. It's the kind of liberalism that was common in the dramas made in the 1930s. It's more a film about corruption and the presence of violence everywhere in America rather than a straight boxing film ... Body and Soul viewed at this late date lacks much relevancy and now only seems gripping because of Garfield's gritty performance, and not because of the intense script that once made waves in powerful circles.Schwartz, Dennis Schwartz .

Background \\"Body and Soul\\" was written in New York City for the British actress and singer Gertrude Lawrence, who introduced it to London audiences. Published in England, it was first performed in the United States by Libby Holman in the 1930 Broadway revue Three's a Crowd. In Britain the orchestras of Jack Hylton and Ambrose recorded the ballad first in the same week in February 1930. In the United States, the tune grew quickly in popularity, and by the end of 1930 at least 11 American bands had recorded it. Louis Armstrong was the first jazz musician to record \\"Body and Soul\\", in October 1930, but it was Paul Whiteman and Jack Fulton who popularized it in United States. \\"Body and Soul\\" is one of the most recorded jazz standards, and multiple lyrics have been written for it. Musical characteristics \\"Body and Soul\\" is usually performed in the key of D flat major. There is a verse that precedes the chorus, that is rarely performed, although recordings by both Libby Holman and Billie Holiday include it. The main part of the tune consists of a repeated eight-bar melody, followed by an eight-bar bridge and a final eight-bar return to the melody. The 32-bar AABA form is typical of popular songs of the time. The \\"A\\" section uses conventional chord progressions including ii‚ÄìV‚ÄìI turnarounds in the home key of D flat, however the bridge is highly unusual in its tonal center shifts. It has been described as \\"a bridge like no other\\".William Zinnser, Easy to Remember: The Great American Songwriters and Their Songs. \\"Body and Soul\\" is considered a challenging piece to solo over; however, the unusual nature of the chords provides a \\"large degree of improvisational freedom\\". Notable recordings=Coleman Hawkins One of the most famous and influential takes was recorded by Coleman Hawkins and His Orchestra on October 11, 1939, at their only recording session for Bluebird, a subsidiary of RCA Victor. The recording is unusual in that the song's melody is only hinted at in the recording; Hawkins' two-choruses of improvisation over the tune's chord progression constitute almost the entire take.Gary Giddins, \\"How Come Jazz Isn't Dead\\", pp. 39‚Äì55 in Eric Weisbard, ed., This is Pop, Harvard University Press, 2004. (cloth), (paper), p. 45. Because of this, as well as the imaginative use of harmony and break from traditional swing cliches, the recording is recognised as part of the \\"early tremors of bebop\\". In 2004, the Library of Congress entered it into the National Recording Registry.See also Gary Giddins, RHYTHM-A-NING, decapo press, pb.\\"Fifty Years of \\"Body and Soul\\", p 45-53.

It was the final recording made by Winehouse before her death on July 23, 2011 at the age of 27. The single was released worldwide on September 14, 2011, what would have been her 28th birthday, on iTunes, MTV and VH1. When the song reached number 87 on the Billboard Hot 100 for the week of October 1, 2011, it made Bennett, at age 85, the oldest living artist ever to chart on the Hot 100, surpassing the previous record of George Burns. This record was then surpassed by Christopher Lee in 2013. It also gave Bennett the longest overall span of appearances on the Hot 100; his version of \\"Young and Warm and Wonderful\\" appeared on the very first Hot 100 chart, for the week of August 4, 1958. The song received a Grammy Award at the 54th Grammy Awards in the Best Pop Duo/Group Performance category on February 12, 2012.

Paludaria (or paludariums) usually consist of an enclosed container in which organisms specific to the biome being simulated are kept. They may be maintained for purely aesthetic reasons or for scientific or horticultural purposes. The word 'paludarium' comes from the Latin word 'palus' meaning marsh or swamp and '-arium' which refers to an enclosed container. Paludaria can range in size from small, easily displayed boxes to biospheres large enough to contain entire trees. A prominent example of a very large paludarium is the rainforest exhibit at the Montreal Biodome. Flora and fauna Since paludaria encompass water, land and air, many different types of fauna can be encompassed in the enclosure. While amphibians, fish and reptiles are the most common, people have kept insects and even birds in them. The animals that are most suited for a paludarium are the animals that naturally live in water/land type environments, swamps, marshes or mangroves. It is like an ecosystem that is placed inside an enclosed container. Flora suited for paludaria include plants that thrive in very humid environments or wetland areas. A common plant is the genus Anubias which is hardy and easy to maintain. The water-filled portion can also support many aquatic species. Design Paludaria are made using an enclosure that can handle large amounts of water without leaks. The land portion is typically added before the water. The land portion may occupy one side of the tank, with water on the other side, or may be made to resemble an island surrounded by water on all sides. The areas occupied by land and by water must each be sufficiently large to meet the needs of the animals who will inhabit them. https://bantam.earth/paludarium/#Building-A-Simple-Paludarium Paludaria can be made from small modifications to existing vivariums, by either adding water to a terrarium or land to an aquarium.

He taught at Columbia University from 1973‚Äì1980 and the Woodrow Wilson School and Economics Department of Princeton University from 1980‚Äì1984 before returning to Stanford. He has received several teaching prizes and teaches Stanford's introductory economics course as well as Ph.D. courses in monetary economics. In research published in 1979 and 1980 he developed a model of price and wage setting‚Äîcalled the staggered contract model‚Äîwhich served as an underpinning of a new class of empirical models with rational expectations and sticky prices‚Äîsometimes called new Keynesian models. :Reprinted in In a 1993 paper he proposed the Taylor rule, Pdf. intended as a recommendation about how nominal interest rates should be determined, which then became a rough summary of how central banks actually do set them. He has been active in public policy, serving as the Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs during the first term of the George W. Bush Administration. His book Global Financial Warriors chronicles this period. He was a member of the President's Council of Economic Advisors during the George H. W. Bush Administration and Senior Economist at the Council of Economic Advisors during the Ford and Carter Administrations. In 2012 he was included in the 50 Most Influential list of Bloomberg Markets Magazine. Thomson Reuters lists Taylor among the 'citation laureates' who are likely future winners of the Nobel Prize in Economics. He is president of the Mont Pelerin Society, a neoliberal economic think tank. Early Life and Education Born in Yonkers, New York, Taylor graduated from Shady Side Academy and earned his A.B. in economics from Princeton University in 1968 after completing a senior thesis titled \\"Fiscal and Monetary Stabilization Policies in a Model of Cyclical Growth\\". He then earned his Ph.D. in economics from Stanford University in 1973. Academic contributions Taylor's research‚Äîincluding the staggered contract model, the Taylor rule, and the construction of a policy tradeoff (Taylor) curve Pdf. :Reprinted in employing empirical rational expectations models‚Äîhas had a major impact on economic theory and policy.Ben Bernanke refers to the ‚Äúthree concepts named after John that are central to understanding our macroeconomic experience of the past three decades‚Äîthe Taylor curve, the Taylor rule, and the Taylor principle.‚Äù in ‚ÄúOpening Remarks,‚Äù Conference on John Taylor‚Äôs Contributions to Monetary Theory and Policy Former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has said that Taylor's ‚Äúinfluence on monetary theory and policy has been profound,‚Äù Remarks at the Conference on John Taylor's Contributions to Monetary Theory and Policy. and Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen has noted that Taylor's work ‚Äúhas affected the way policymakers and economists analyze the economy and approach monetary policy.\\" Remarks at the Conference on John Taylor's Contributions to Monetary Theory and Policy. Taylor contributed to the development of mathematical methods for solving macroeconomic models under the assumption of rational expectations, including in a 1975 Journal of Political Economy paper, in which he showed how gradual learning could be incorporated in models with rational expectations; a 1979 Econometrica paper in which he presented one of the first econometric models with overlapping price setting and rational expectations, which he later expanded into a large multicountry model in a 1993 book Macroeconomic Policy in a World Economy, and a 1983 Econometrica paper, in which he developed with Ray Fair the first algorithm to solve large-scale dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models which became part of popular solution programs such as Dynare and EViews. and ‚ÄúEviews Users Guide II.‚Äù In 1977, Taylor and Edmund Phelps, simultaneously with Stanley Fischer, showed that monetary policy is useful for stabilizing the economy if prices or wages are sticky, even when all workers and firms have rational expectations. This demonstrated that some of the earlier insights of Keynesian economics remained true under rational expectations. This was important because Thomas Sargent and Neil Wallace had argued that rational expectations would make macroeconomic policy useless for stabilization; the results of Taylor, Phelps, and Fischer showed that Sargent and Wallace's crucial assumption was not rational expectations, but perfectly flexible prices. These research projects together could considerably deepen our understanding of the limits of the policy-ineffectiveness proposition. Taylor then developed the staggered contract model of overlapping wage and price setting, which became one of the building blocks of the New Keynesian macroeconomics that rebuilt much of the traditional macromodel on rational expectations microfoundations. Taylor's research on monetary policy rules traces back to his undergraduate studies at Princeton. He went on in the 1970s and 1980s to explore what types of monetary policy rules would most effectively reduce the social costs of inflation and business cycle fluctuations: should central banks try to control the money supply, the price level, or the interest rate; and should these instruments react to changes in output, unemployment, asset prices, or inflation rates? He showed that there was a tradeoff‚Äîlater called the Taylor curve Remarks at the meeting of the Eastern Economic Association.‚Äîbetween the volatility of inflation and that of output. Taylor's 1993 paper in the Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy proposed that a simple and effective central bank policy would manipulate short-term interest rates, raising rates to cool the economy whenever inflation or output growth becomes excessive, and lowering rates when either one falls too low. Taylor's interest rate equation has come to be known as the Taylor rule, and it is now widely accepted as an effective formula for monetary decision making. A key stipulation of the Taylor rule, sometimes called the Taylor principle, is that the nominal interest rate should increase by more than one percentage point for each one-percent rise in inflation. Some empirical estimates indicate that many central banks today act approximately as the Taylor rule prescribes, but violated the Taylor principle during the inflationary spiral of the 1970s. Pdf. Recent research Taylor's recent research has been on the financial crisis that began in 2007 and the world economic recession. He finds that the crisis was primarily caused by flawed macroeconomic policies from the U.S. government and other governments. Particularly, he focuses on the Federal Reserve which, under Alan Greenspan, a personal friend of Taylor, created \\"monetary excesses\\" in which interest rates were kept too low for too long, which then directly led to the housing boom in his opinion. He also believes that Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae spurred on the boom and that the crisis was misdiagnosed as a liquidity rather than a credit risk problem. He wrote that, \\"government actions and interventions, not any inherent failure or instability of the private economy, caused, prolonged, and worsen the crisis.\\" Pdf. Taylor's research has also examined the impact of fiscal policy in the recent recession. In November 2008, writing for The Wall Street Journal opinion section, he recommended four measures to fight the economic downturn: (a) permanently keeping all income tax rates the same, (b) permanently creating a worker's tax credit equal to 6.2 percent of wages up to $8,000, (c) incorporating \\"automatic stabilizers\\" as part of overall fiscal plans, and (d) enacting a short-term stimulus plan that also meets long-term objectives against waste and inefficiency. He stated that merely temporary tax cuts would not serve as a good policy tool. His research with John Cogan, Tobias Cwik, and Volcker Wieland showed that the multiplier is much smaller in new Keynesian than in old Keynesian models, a result that was confirmed by researchers at central banks. Pdf. He evaluated the 2008 and 2009 stimulus packages and argued that they were not effective in stimulating the economy. Pdf. In a June 2011 interview on Bloomberg Television, Taylor stressed the importance of long term fiscal reform that sets the U.S. federal budget on a path towards being balanced. He cautioned that the Fed should move away from quantitative easing measures and keep to a more static, stable monetary policy. He also criticized fellow economist Paul Krugman's advocacy of additional stimulus programs from Congress, which Taylor said will not help in the long run. In his 2012 book First Principles: Five Keys to Restoring America‚Äôs Prosperity, he endeavors to explain why these reforms are part of a broader set of principles of economic freedom.

Roll (July 3, 1926 ‚Äì January 9, 2012) was an American psychologist and parapsychologist on the faculty of the Psychology Department of the University of West Georgia in Carrollton, Georgia. Roll is most notable for his belief in poltergeist activity. He coined the term \\"recurrent spontaneous psychokinesis\\" (RSPK) to explain poltergeist cases. However, RSPK was never accepted by mainstream science and skeptics have described Roll as a credulous investigator. Career Roll was born in 1926 in Bremen, Germany, where his father, diplomat William Roll, was American Vice-consul. At the age of three, after his parents divorced, he moved to Denmark with his mother Gudrun Agerholm Roll. According to Roll, while in Denmark, he began having out-of- body experiences at night.Houran, James. (2004). From Shaman to Scientist: Essays on Humanity's Search for Spirits. Scarecrow Press. p. 171. His mother died in 1942 and in 1946 he went to America with his father, who had come to Denmark with the American Allied forces. Roll enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1947, where he received his BA, majoring in philosophy and psychology. A year after graduating, he went on to Oxford University, where he did parapsychology research for eight years. During this period, he was president of the Oxford University Society for Psychical Research. At Oxford, he wrote his thesis which earned him his Master of Letters degree, \\"Theory and Experiment in Psychical Research\\". His thesis was later published in the United States by Arno Press. Sometimes credited as William Roll, or informally, Bill Roll, he was a parapsychologist since the 1950s and authored or coauthored many research papers and articles, as well as four books: The Poltergeist (1972), Theory and Experiment in Psychical Research (1975), Psychic Connections (1995, with co-author Lois Duncan), and Unleashed: Of Poltergeists and Murder: The Curious Story of Tina Resch (2004, with co-author Valerie Storey). He is also notable for making several appearances in the television show Unsolved Mysteries, among them an episode discussing disturbances on the RMS Queen Mary (in this episode he was mistakenly credited as being Danish-born). Roll was invited by J. B. Rhine to join the Parapsychology Laboratory of Duke University, where he worked from 1957 to 1964. In 1964, he became president of the Parapsychological Association. In 1958, he coined the term \\"recurrent spontaneous psychokinesis\\" (RSPK) in a research paper written with J. G. Pratt that dealt with their investigation of objects moving in a home in Seaford, Long Island, New York USA, that was centered on a 12-year-old son of an affected family. In 1961, Roll became project director of the Psychical Research Foundation (PRF), an offshoot of J. B. Rhine's Laboratory. After Rhine's retirement from Duke, the PRF left the Duke campus, but in 1969 it returned to Duke as a sponsored program of the School of Electrical Engineering. Roll received a Ph.D. in psychology from Lund University in 1989 for a thesis entitled, \\"This World or That: An Examination of Parapsychological Findings Suggestive of the Survival of Human Personality After Death\\". In the 1980s and 1990s, Roll held various positions at the University of West Georgia, including Professor of Psychology and Psychical Research, assistant professor, and instructor. In later years, Roll retired from teaching, though he taught a course in parapsychology at the University of West Georgia in 2007, and continued to write, speak at conferences, and conduct occasional investigations. He was awarded the Parapsychological Award for a Distinguished Career in Parapsychology in 1996 and the Dinsdale Memorial Award from the Society of Scientific Exploration in 2002. Roll's most famous case was as the lead investigator on the 1984 \\"Columbus Poltergeist\\" case, in which remarkable color photos were taken by a veteran newspaper photographer for the Columbus Dispatch newspaper, Fred Shannon, which allegedly showed spontaneous telekinesis events in action occurring in the home of Columbus, Ohio, teenager Tina Resch. Roll died at the age of 85, in a nursing home in Normal, Illinois. Prior to that, he had a long residence in the state of Georgia in the southeastern United States with his wife. He is survived by his adult children, grandchildren, and his wife. Seaford poltergeist The James Hermann family of the alleged Seaford poltergeist case In Seaford, New York, strange poltergeist events were reported by James M. Herrmann and his family in their house. In 1958, Roll investigated the case with the parapsychologist Joseph Gaither Pratt and suggested that although some of the phenomena may have been pranks from Hermann's twelve-year-old son James Jr, some of the events were the result of \\"recurrent spontaneous psychokinesis\\" (RSPK). However, RSPK has never been accepted by mainstream science and there is no evidence it exists.Nickell, Joe. (2012). The Science of Ghosts: Searching for Spirits of the Dead. Prometheus Books. pp. 333-341. The case was later re-evaluated by the skeptic Joe Nickell who concluded that all the phenomena could be explained by deliberate trickery from Hermann's son James Jr. According to Nickell, both Pratt and Roll were rather credulous and had little understanding of magic trickery. Nickell concluded that \\"Taken as a whole, the evidence strongly points to twelve-year-old James Hermann Jr. as having been the deliberate cause of the Seaford \\"poltergeist\\" outbreak. The motive, means, and opportunity were his, and the case was unwittingly prolonged by the credulousness of adults.\\" Reception Roll's theory that poltergeists are the result of psychokinetic activity has drawn criticism from magicians and skeptics. Roll is notable for endorsing Tina Resch a central figure in a series of incidents that came to be called the Columbus poltergeist case, who he spent a week investigating. Magician and skeptical investigator Bob Couttie has written: :Roll's report has been heavily criticised. For instance, a picture fell from a bedroom wall and Roll started to replace it by hammering in a nail with a pair of pliers. As he did this, he was watching Tina out of the corner of his eye, or so he says, yet Roll is very short-sighted and it takes a brave man to hammer in a nail and attend to very poor peripheral vision at the same time. While he was doing this, Roll's tape- recorder was moved from a dresser that was immediately behind him. He turned to pick up the machine, which had come to rest between 7ft and 9ft behind him. As he did this his pliers were moved to a far wall. It is difficult to accept that Tina was sufficiently closely observed to preclude her moving the tape-recorder and pliers.Couttie, Bob. (1988). Forbidden Knowledge: The Paranormal Paradox. Lutterworth Press. pp. 60-61. Resch was detected utilizing trickery by James Randi, but Roll had endorsed her phenomena as genuine.Nickell, Joe. (1992). Missing Pieces: How to Investigate Ghosts, UFOs, Psychics, & Other Mysteries. Prometheus Books. pp. 136-137. Henry Gordon has stated that parapsychologists such as Roll and Nandor Fodor took a speculative approach to the poltergeist subject, ignoring the rational explanation of deception in favor of a belief in the paranormal.Gordon, Henry. (1988). Extrasensory Deception: ESP, Psychics, Shirley MacLaine, Ghosts, UFO. Prometheus Books. pp. 106-107.

Choropleth maps provide an easy way to visualize how a measurement varies across a geographic area or show the level of variability within a region. A heat map or isarithmic map is similar but does not use a priori geographic areas. They are the most common type of thematic map because published statistical data (from government or other sources) is generally aggregated into well-known geographic units, such as countries, states, provinces, and counties, and thus they are relatively easy to create using GIS, spreadsheets, or other software tools.  Overview  The earliest known choropleth map was created in 1826 by Baron Pierre Charles Dupin. They were first called \\"cartes teint√©es\\" (coloured map in French). The term \\"choroplethe map\\" was introduced in 1938 by the geographer John Kirtland Wright in \\"Problems in Population Mapping\\".John Kirtland Wright (1938). \\"Problems in Population Mapping\\" in \\"Notes on statistical mapping, with special reference to the mapping of population phenomena\\". Choropleth maps are based on statistical data aggregated over previously defined regions (e.g., counties), in contrast to area-class and isarithmic maps, in which region boundaries are defined by data patterns. Thus, where defined regions are important to a discussion, as in an election map divided by electoral regions, choropleths are preferred. Choropleth maps are generalizations of an areal distribution where real-world patterns may not conform to the regional unit symbolized. Because of this, issues such as the ecological fallacy and the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) can lead to major misinterpretations of the data depicted, and other techniques are preferable.T. Slocum, R. McMaster, F. Kessler, H. Howard (2009). Thematic Cartography and Geovisualization, Third Edn, pages 85‚Äì86. Pearson Prentice Hall: Upper Saddle River, NJ. Similarly, the size and specificity of the displayed regions depend on the variable being represented. While the use of smaller and more specific regional units such as census tracts, zip codes, or county boundaries can decrease the risk of an ecological fallacy and MAUP, it may inadvertently cause the map (or the data displayed) to appear more sophisticated than reality. Although representing specific data in large regions can be misleading, it can make the map clearer and easier to interpret and remember. The choice of regions will ultimately depend on the map's intended audience and purpose. The dasymetric technique can be thought of as a compromise approach in many situations. Broadly speaking, choropleths represent two types of data: spatially extensive or spatially intensive. * Spatially extensive data are things like populations. The population of the United Kingdom might be 65 million, but it would not be accurate to arbitrarily cut the UK into two halves of equal area and say that the population of each half of the UK is 32.5 million. * Spatially intensive data are things like rates, densities, and proportions, which can be thought of conceptually as field data that is averaged over an area. For example, though the United Kingdom's 65 million inhabitants occupy an area of about 240,000 km2 with a population density of about 250/km2, arbitrary halves of an equal area would not possess equal population densities.  Normalization  Normalization:the map on the left uses total population to determine color. This causes larger polygons to appear to be more urbanized than the smaller dense urban areas of Boston, Massachusetts. The map on the right uses population density. A properly normalized map will show variables independent of the size of the polygons. Another common error in choropleth maps are the use of raw data values to represent magnitude rather than normalized values to produce a map of densities.Mark Monmonier (1991). How to Lie with Maps. pp. 22‚Äì23. University of Chicago Press This is problematic because the eye naturally integrates over areas of the same color, giving undue prominence to larger polygons of moderate magnitude and minimizing the significance of smaller polygons with high magnitudes. The problem with using data in total counts arises when the polygons are not all the same size (in area or total population), as in the figure at right. Because a single color, representing a single value, is spread over the entire area of the district, large areas will be more dominant in the visual hierarchy than they should be, and are commonly misinterpreted as having larger values than smaller districts with the same color. To solve this issue, one can normalize the variable by dividing it by the total area, thus deriving density, which is a field. Another solution is to represent total amounts using a proportional symbol map. Other valid forms of normalization for choropleth maps can be derived by computing ratios between two total amounts, such as rates of change (e.g. population growth = 2010 population / 2000 population) and mean allocations (e.g. mean family income = total income / total families), or other descriptive statistics such as the median or standard deviation.T. Slocum, R. McMaster, F. Kessler, H. Howard (2009). Thematic Cartography and Geovisualization, Third Edn, page 252. Pearson Prentice Hall: Upper Saddle River, NJ.  Classification  *Equal intervals * Equal frequency * Geometric progressions * Standard deviation * Jenks natural breaks optimization * Head/tail Breaks  Color progression  When mapping quantitative data, a specific color progression should be used to depict the data properly. There are several different types of color progressions used by cartographers. The following are described in detail in Robinson et al. (1995)Robinson, A.H., Morrison, J.L., Muehrke, P.C., Kimmerling, A.J. & Guptill, S.C. (1995) Elements of Cartography. (6th Edition), New York: Wiley. Single hue progression Single-hue progressions fade from a dark shade of the chosen color to a very light or white shade of relatively the same hue. This is a common method used to map magnitude. The darkest hue represents the greatest number in the data set and the lightest shade representing the least number. Two variables may be shown through the use of two overprinted single color scales. The hues typically used are from red to white for the first data set and blue to white for the second, they are then overprinted to produce varying hues. These type of maps show the magnitude of the values in relation to each other. Bi-polar color progression Bi-polar progressions are normally used with two opposite hues to show a change in value from negative to positive or on either side of some either central tendency, such as the mean of the variable being mapped or other significant value like room temperature. For example, a typical progression when mapping temperatures is from dark blue (for cold) to dark red (for hot) with white in the middle. When one extreme can be considered better than the other (as in this map of life expectancy) then it is common to denote the poor alternative with shades of red, and the good alternative with green. Complementary hue progressions are a type of bi-polar progression. This can be done with any of the complementary colors and will fade from each of the darker end point hues into a gray shade representing the middle. An example would be using blue and yellow as the two end points. Blended hue color progression Blended hue progressions use related hues to blend together the two end point hues. This type of color progression is typically used to show elevation changes. For example, from yellow through orange to brown. Partial spectral color progression Partial spectral hue progressions are used to map mixtures of two distinct sets of data. This type of hue progression will blend two adjacent opponent hues and show the magnitude of the mixing data classes. Full-spectral color progression Full spectral progression contains hues from blue through red. This is common on relief maps and modern weather maps. This type of progression is not recommended under other circumstances because certain color connotations can confuse the map user. Value progression Value progression maps are monochromatic. Although any color may be used, the archetype is from black to white with intervening shades of gray that represent magnitude. According to Robinson et al. (1995).Robinson et al. (1995), op. cit. this is the best way to portray a magnitude message to the map audience. It is clearly understood by the user and easy to produce in print. Qualitative color progression A Qualitative progression is often used when working with nominal or qualitative data. The colors shown on the map seem unrelated to one another or are arbitrarily chosen. For example, a choropleth map of \\"most prevalent religion\\" would be best shown with this type of scheme. Usability A choropleth map (top) and a dasymetric map (bottom) of the population of the San Francisco Bay Area in 2000. When using any of these methods, there are two important principles: first is that darker colors are perceived as being higher in magnitude; second is that, while there are millions of color variations, the human eye is limited as to how many colors it can easily distinguish. Generally, five to seven color categories are recommended. The map user should be able to easily identify the implied magnitude of the hue and to match it with the legend. Additional considerations include color blindness and various reproduction techniques. For example, the red‚Äìgreen bi-polar progression described in the section above is likely to cause problems for dichromats. A related issue is that color scales which rely primarily on hue with insufficient variation in saturation or intensity may be compromised if reproduced in black and white. Conversely, if a map is legible in black and white (lightness-based), then a prospective user's perception of color is irrelevant. Color can greatly enhance the communication between the cartographer and their audience, but poor color choice can result in a map that is neither effective nor appealing to the map user. A simpler correlation between color-properties and underlying values is better. With considerations for black-and-white rendering, the color mapping function should be chosen to make sure the lightness of the color is still monotonic, or the uneven change would make it hard to interpret levels, for both normal and colorblind viewers. One commonly-mentioned offender is the \\"rainbow\\" palette, the default palette in many statistical applications that has a back-and-forth change in lightness.

After acquiring a law degree in Padua he decided instead to embark on a career of music criticism, propelled by love for the music of Verdi and a need to defend it against the criticism it was receiving from some quarters. In 1859 he was employed by the Gazzetta musicale di Milano as assistant editor, but soon became editor, a position he held until 1862, at which time he became a critic for La perseveranza, a position he held for the rest of his life.

Hoechst stains are part of a family of blue fluorescent dyes used to stain DNA. These Bis-benzimides were originally developed by Hoechst AG, which numbered all their compounds so that the dye Hoechst 33342 is the 33,342nd compound made by the company. There are three related Hoechst stains: Hoechst 33258, Hoechst 33342, and Hoechst 34580. The dyes Hoechst 33258 and Hoechst 33342 are the ones most commonly used and they have similar excitation‚Äìemission spectra. Molecular characteristics Excitation-emission spectra of Hoechst dyes. Both dyes are excited by ultraviolet light at around 350 nm, and both emit blue-cyan fluorescent light around an emission spectrum maximum at 461 nm. Unbound dye has its maximum fluorescence emission in the 510‚Äì540 nm range. Hoechst stains can be excited with a xenon- or mercury-arc lamp or with an ultraviolet laser. There is a considerable Stokes shift between the excitation and emission spectra that makes Hoechst dyes useful in experiments in which multiple fluorophores are used. The fluorescence intensity of Hoechst dyes also increases with the pH of the solvent. Hoechst dyes are soluble in water and in organic solvents such as dimethyl formamide or dimethyl sulfoxide. Concentrations can be achieved of up to 10 mg/mL. Aqueous solutions are stable at 2‚Äì6 ¬∞C for at least six months when protected from light. For longterm storage the solutions are instead frozen at ‚àí20 ¬∞C or below. Hoechst 33258 (magenta) bound to the minor groove of DNA (green and blue). From . The dyes bind to the minor groove of double- stranded DNA with a preference for sequences rich in adenine and thymine. Although the dyes can bind to all nucleic acids, AT-rich double-stranded DNA strands enhance fluorescence considerably. Hoechst dyes are cell-permeable and can bind to DNA in live or fixed cells. Thus, these stains are often called supravital, meaning that live cells survive a treatment with these compounds. Cells that express specific ATP-binding cassette transporter proteins can also actively transport these stains out of their cytoplasm. Applications Transmission image of HeLa cells, with overlay of Hoechst 33258 staining (blue). The leftmost cell is in the prometaphase stage of mitosis; its chromosomes fluoresce brightly because they contain highly compacted DNA. Fluorescent image of cultivated neutrophils isolated from venous blood of human with Alzheimer Disease. Sample was treated with Hoechst 33342 dye that is used to stain DNA. The picture shows the release of DNA by a neutrophil as foggy area in the center of the view field indicating the spontaneous activation of neutrophil extracellular traps formation in AD patients that is not usually observed in healthy mates. A concentration of 0.1‚Äì12 Œºg/ml is commonly used to stain DNA in bacteria or eukaryote cells. Cells are stained for 1-30 min at room temperature or 37 ¬∞C and then washed to remove unbound dye. A green fluorescence of unbound Hoechst dye may be observed on samples which are stained with too much dye or which are washed partially. Hoechst dyes are often used as substitutes for another nucleic acid stain called DAPI. Key differences between Hoechst dyes and DAPI are: * Hoechst dyes are less toxic than DAPI, which ensures a higher viability of stained cells * The additional ethyl group of the Hoechst dyes renders them more cell-permeable. * There are nuclei staining dyes that allow for viability of cells after staining. Hoechst 33342 and 33258 are quenched by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), which is commonly used to detect dividing cells. Hoechst 33342 exhibits a 10 fold greater cell-permeability than H 33258. Cells can integrate BrdU in newly synthesized DNA as a substitute for thymidine. When BrdU is integrated into DNA, it is supposed that the bromine deforms the minor groove so that Hoechst dyes cannot reach their optimal binding site. Binding of Hoechst dyes is even stronger to BrdU-substituted DNA; however, no fluorescence ensues. Hoechst dyes can be used with BrdU to monitor cell cycle progression. Hoechst dyes are commonly used to stain genomic DNA in the following applications: * Fluorescence microscopy and immunohistochemistry, often with other fluorophores * Flow cytometry to count or sort out cells. An example is the use of Hoechst dyes to analyse how many cells of a population are in which phase of the cell cycle * Detecting DNA in the presence of RNA in agarose gels * Automated DNA determination * Chromosome sorting Hoechst efflux is also used to study hematopoietic and embryonic stem cells. As these cells are able to effectively efflux the dye, they can be detected via flow cytometry in what is termed the side population. This is done by passing the fluorescence emitted from the excited hoechst through both red and blue filters, and plotting hoechst red and blue against each other. Toxicity and safety Because Hoechst stains bind to DNA, they interfere with DNA replication during cell division. Consequently, they are potentially mutagenic and carcinogenic, so care should be used in their handling and disposal. Hoechst stain is used to sort sperm in livestock and humans. Its safety has been debated.

He served as the 5th President of the Singer Manufacturing Company between 1889 and 1905. He made the business \\"perhaps the first modern multinational industrial enterprise of any nationality\\". Early life Bourne was born on December 20, 1851 in Boston, Massachusetts. He was the son of the Rev. George Washington Bourne (1815‚Äì1872) and Harriet J. (n√©e Gilbert) Bourne (1817‚Äì1907), who was from Portsmouth, Maine. His older sister was Clara Bourne, who married John Loring Whitman. His paternal grandparents were Benjamin Bourne and Mary (n√©e Hatch) Bourne, herself the daughter of Joshua Hatch, a soldier during the American Revolutionary War who was killed near Crown Point after the evacuation of Fort Ticonderoga in 1777. Bourne was educated at public schools in New York before joining the work force at age fourteen. Career The Singer Building, commissioned by Bourne for the Singer Manufacturing Company and completed in 1908. In order to support of his widowed mother and younger sisters, Bourne started his career in New York with the Atlantic Submarine Wrecking Company, later becoming a cashier and bookkeeper and the clerk of the Mercantile Library. Bourne, who was interested in music, was a member of the Mendelssohn Glee Club, which is likely where he met Alfred Corning Clark, the son of Edward Cabot Clark, who along with Isaac Merritt Singer, was a co-founder of the Singer Company. Bourne and Clark developed a \\"close personal relationship\\" and in 1880, Clark recommended to his father that Bourne be invited to join his family's real estate company, which owned several parcels of valuable Manhattan real estate, and be brought on as construction manager of The Dakota, then being built on West 72nd Street along Central Park. Clark frequently traveled abroad, often to Norway to visit the singer Lorentz Severin Skougaard (with whom he had a relationship despite his marriage to Elizabeth Scriven), and in his place, Clark sent Bourne to Singer board meetings. In 1882, following the elder Clark's death, Bourne became the manager of the late Clark's estate. In 1885, Bourne became Secretary of the company and in 1889, at the age of 38, Bourne became the fifth president of Singer. While president, Bourne also oversaw the construction of the company's headquarters, known as the Singer Building. Bourne greatly expanded global production as well as international sales of the Singer sewing machine. Bourne was revolutionary to the sewing machine industry. He used the \\"installment plan\\" to make sewing machines a household item. Bourne is also remembered \\"among the most important innovators in building vertically integrated firms\\".Frederick Gilbert Bourne Forgotten Titan of the Gilded Age. By Philip Selvaggio. www.createspace.com/6880175 In 1905, and after sixteen years as president, Bourne retired and was succeeded by Douglas Alexander, who served as president for the next forty-four years. Alexander was created a baronet in the 1921 Birthday Honours for his services to the welfare of industrial workers. Residences Bourne owned several homes and estates. He maintained an apartment at The Dakota in New York City, which occupied the entire first floor; he owned a 2,000-acre (4 km¬≤) country estate named Indian Neck Hall in Oakdale on Long Island next to Idle Hour, the estate of William Kissam Vanderbilt; he owned a 375 acre farm near Montauk, New York, which he used an undeveloped hunting preserve; an apartment on Jekyll Island, Georgia; and the 7-acre Dark Island in the Thousand Islands in the St. Lawrence River. In 1902, Bourne hired architect Ernest Flagg to build him a small hunting lodge on the Dark Island property. The building was based on a book written by Sir Walter Scott in 1826 called Woodstock. This book describes an elegant castle with secret passageways, tunnels, and a dungeon. Today, the castle is known as Singer Castle.Frederick Gilbert Bourne profile at the official Singer Castle website Personal life On February 9, 1875, he was married to Emma Sparks Keeler (1855‚Äì1916), the daughter of James Rufus Keeler and Mary Louise (n√©e Davidson) Keeler. Emma was a granddaughter of Commodore Davidson, one of the founders of the New York Yacht Club. Together, they were the parents of twelve children: * Frederick Gilbert Bourne Jr (1876‚Äì1884). * Arthur Keeler Bourne (1877‚Äì1967), who married Edith Hollins; their son: Arthur Keeler Bourne (1899-1974); divorced.

They divorced in 1932 after having seven children. * George Gault Bourne (1888‚Äì1964), who married Nancy Atterbury Potter, a granddaughter of Bishop Alonzo Potter. * Marjorie Bourne (1890‚Äì1962), who married Alexander Dallas Thayer (1888-1968). * Kenneth Bourne (1891‚Äì1898), who died in childhood. * Howard Davidson Bourne (1893‚Äì1918), who died aged 25. A sailing enthusiast, Bourne served as a Commodore of the New York Yacht Club. He was also a member of the famous Jekyll Island Club (aka The Millionaires Club) on Jekyll Island, Georgia. Bourne owned many boats that he frequently used in New York City and at his summer home in the Thousand Islands. After several months of ill-health, Bourne died at Indian Neck Hall, his residence in Oakdale on Long Island, on March 9, 1919. He died one of the wealthiest men in America, leaving an estate valued at $25,000,000.

The lot where the building stands is considered to be under United Nations jurisdiction, although it remains geopolitically located within the United States. It is the first skyscraper in New York City to use a curtain wall. History The groundbreaking ceremony for the Secretariat Building occurred on September 14, 1948. A consortium of four contracting companies from Manhattan and Queens were selected to construct the Secretariat Building as part of a $30 million contract. The 39-story Secretariat Building was completed in 1950, making it the first new structure at the UN Headquarters. Staff started moving in as early as August of that year and it was fully occupied by June, 1951. The building was designed by the Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer and the Swiss- French architect Le Corbusier. One notable feature outside the building is a circular pool with a decorative fountain in its centre, which was a gift from the children of the United States, paid for by small donations in schools from all across the country. This building is connected to the Conference Building to the north that houses the General Assembly, the Security Council, among others, and a library building to the south. The building houses the administrative functions of the UN, including day-to-day duties such as finance and translation. As part of the UN complex, the building is subject to an agreement between the United Nations and its host country, the United States.Agreement between the United Nations and the United States regarding the headquarters of the UN , retrieved 2014-11-01. The UN Secretariat Building was renovated starting in May 2010, and reopened in phases with the first occupants moving in July 2012. On October 29, 2012, the basement of the UN complex was flooded due to Hurricane Sandy, leading to a three-day closure and the relocation of several offices. Influence The building style has inspired some notable copies, including the Headquarters of South Lanarkshire Council in Hamilton, Scotland, known locally as the \\"County Buildings\\". It also inspired the construction of other curtain wall buildings in Manhattan, such as the Lever House, Corning Glass Building, and Springs Mills Building.

He places Nikolaus Herman's Easter hymn \\"\\" in the centre of the cantata, repeats the line \\"\\" (Peace be with you) several times, and ends with the first stanza from Jakob Ebert's hymn \\"\\" (Thou Prince of Peace, Lord Jesus Christ). Bach structured the work in seven movements, arranged in symmetry around the central chorale, and scored it for three solo voices, a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of a slide horn for hymn tunes, flauto traverso, two oboes d'amore, strings and basso continuo. Besides the unusual central chorale, the cantata contains a dramatic scena with Jesus repeating \\"Peace be with you\\" against the enemies.  History and words  Bach composed the cantata in his first year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, shortly after he first performed his St John Passion, for the First Sunday after Easter, called . The prescribed readings for that Sunday were from the First Epistle of John, \\"our faith is the victory\\" (), and from the Gospel of John, the appearance of Jesus to the Disciples, first without then with Thomas, in Jerusalem (). The unknown poet begins with a verse from the Second Epistle to Timothy, \\"Remember that Jesus Christ ‚Ä¶ was raised from the dead\\" (). The poet sees Thomas as similar to the doubtful Christian in general, whose heart is not at peace. The center of the cantata is the Easter hymn \\"\\" (The glorious day has appeared) by Nikolaus Herman (1560), praising the day of the resurrection. In contrast, movement 5 recalls the danger by the enemies, until in movement 6 Jesus appears, as he did to his disciples in Jerusalem, finally bringing peace. The line \\"\\" (Peace be with you) is repeated four times, framing three stanzas of a poem. The closing chorale is the first stanza of \\"\\" (Thou Prince of Peace, Lord Jesus Christ) by Jakob Ebert (1601). Bach led the first performance on 16 April 1724.  Music = Structure and scoring  Bach structured the cantata in seven movements, arranged symmetrically around a central chorale. He scored the work for three vocal soloists (alto, tenor, bass), a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of corno da tirarsi (Ct, a slide horn that Bach scored for a short period), flauto traverso (Ft), two oboes d'amore (Oa), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), and basso continuo. In the following table of the movements, the scoring follows the Neue Bach-Ausgabe. The keys and time signatures are taken from Alfred D√ºrr, using the symbol for common time (4/4). The continuo, playing throughout, is not shown.  Movements  The opening chorus reflects the contrast of hope and resurrection versus simultaneous remembrance and doubt, which is present throughout the cantata. The chorus is structured in symmetry in seven sections, beginning with an instrumental sinfonia of all instruments, the horn introducing a theme representing remembrance in a melody which resembles the choral tune of \\"\\" which Bach would later use as a cantus firmus in the opening movement of his St Matthew Passion. Bach thus alludes to the idea that Jesus suffered innocently for the \\"sins of the world\\" before he rose again. In the second section, this melody is sung by the sopranos, while the lower voices stress the word \\"Halt\\" (hold) by several homophonic chords. In the third section, the sopranos repeat the melody in a fugue, while the altos simultaneously sing a countersubject that rises in fast movement for more than an octave, illustrating the resurrection. The fourth section is a reprise of the sinfonia with the voices added, then a variation of sections 2 to 4 follows as 5 to 7. The tenor aria ' (My Jesus is arisen) is accompanied by an obbligato oboe d'amore. The theme is presented in the opening by the strings and later picked up by the voice, illustrating the word \\"\\" by an upward run. The Easter hymn \\"\\" marks the center of the composition. In symmetry, it is framed by two alto recitatives, the second a reprise of the first. The idea of a solo singer alternating with a chorus is extended in the following movement, the bass aria with chorus ' (Peace be with you). A string introduction depicts in agitated forte passages in 4/4 time the attack of the enemies. John Eliot Gardiner describes it as \\"a dramatic scena in which the strings work up a storm to illustrate the raging of the soul's enemies\\". In sharp contrast the bass as the vox Christi (voice of Christ) sings the greeting of Jesus from verse 19 of the Gospel, \\"Peace be with you\\", three times, accompanied by woodwinds in dotted rhythm in 3/4 time, marked piano. Musicologist Julian Mincham describes the music as serene, a \\"gentle, rocking, almost cradle-like rhythm creating a perfect atmosphere of peaceful contemplation\\". The upper voices of the choir (without basses) answer to the music of the introduction, seeing Jesus as help in the battle (\\"\\"). The greeting and answering is repeated two more times in two stanzas of the poem, reflecting the strengthening of the weary in spirit and body (\\"\\"), and finally overcoming death (\\"\\"). The following fourth appearance of \\"Peace be with you\\" is accompanied by both woodwinds and strings, and peace is finally achieved. Klaus Hofmann describes the movement as an \\"operatic scene\\" and continues \\"Bach resorts to unconventional means; he shows himself as a musical dramatist and, in the process, stresses the element of contrast: he comments upon the words of the faithful with agitated, tumultuous string figures, whilst Jesus' peace greeting sounds calmly and majestically, embedded in pastoral wind sonorities.\\" Bach adapted this movement as the Gloria of his Missa in A major, BWV 234. The closing chorale \\"Du Friedef√ºrst, Herr Jesu Christ\\" is a four-part setting.  Recordings  The table below is taken from the selection on the Bach Cantatas Website.

The mouth of the Cowichan River is near Cowichan Bay. Mount Tzouhalem and its hiking trails and ecological reserve stands to the north. The bay is known for its fishing and scenic value. The area's main industries are fishing and tourism. First Nation history For many thousands of years Cowichan Bay was home to First Nations people who harvested the wealth of salmon and shellfish found in its many coves, tidal flats and swiftly flowing rivers. A rare steatite anthropomorphic bowl was discovered on Cowichan Bay in the late nineteenth century. One of only about 50 so far found and estimated to originate from the Marpole Culture (400 BC-400 AD), it is now in the British Museum's collection.British Museum Collection European settlement Cowichan Bay was the gateway for European settlement of the Cowichan and Chemainus valleys from the early 1860s. A steamer service from Victoria was the major link for goods and people before the coming of the railway. Bypassed by the Esquimalt and Nanaimo line and later by the Island Highway, Cowichan Bay nevertheless was a thriving little community, based on sport and commercial salmon fishing, and log and lumber exports. From the early 1900s Cowichan Bay attracted sportsmen from all over the British Empire for superb salmon fishing in the Bay and the Cowichan and Koksilah rivers. It was, for a time, the Salmon Capital of the World offering not just fishing, but fine sailing waters, an annual regatta and, next to Wimbledon, the oldest grass tennis courts in the world. Tourism Mount Tzouhalem from Cowichan Bay The village of Cowichan Bay is a tourist attraction in the summer because of its cozy fishing-village feel. The community began a transformation in 2004 when Jonathan Knight opened True Grain Bread, a European inspired bakery at the centre of the seaside village. His organic breads and pretzels and a focus on local and sustainable business practices quickly made a name for the bakery and the community. His success spawned other businesses to open in the bay; Radway Studios, an organic clothing store; Hilary's Cheese, a local-made cheese shop; The Udder Guys, an old-style homemade ice-cream parlour; The Masthead, an upscale restaurant that serves delicious local foods; The Mud Room Clayworks, a pottery shop run by a local artisan; as well as many other eateries and knick-knack shops. Cowichan Bay offers visitors a chance to see their impressive wildlife through kayak tours and rentals and whalewatching tours. Depending on the time of year it is not uncommon to see bald eagles, seals, herons or other wildlife in the area. Economy A noted deepwater port where tankers and container ships can still be seen at anchor regularly, Cowichan Bay has been plagued by derelicts abandoned at anchor and left to rot -- most notably the fuel-filled Dominion, which dragged anchor during a winter storm before being towed away for scrap after a 5-year period, and the replica Beaver, which replaced her, towed in by the same tug that removed the derelict Dominion. Cowichan Bay's former economic base is declining, but being replaced with more recreational water activities, a revived interest in boatbuilding, an appreciation for the history and ecology of the Bay, and tourism. Local politics Cowichan Bay services are provided by the Cowichan Valley Regional District, with fire protection provided by the Cowichan Bay Improvement District which operates Cowichan Bay Fire Rescue. In 2009, Cowichan Bay became Canada and North America's first Cittaslow community.

He is famous for recognizing the significance of the bones of Neanderthal 1, a Neanderthal specimen discovered by German laborers who were digging for limestone in Neander valley (Neanderthal in German) in August 1856. Originally disregarded, Fuhlrott, to his eternal credit, had the insight to recognize them for what they were: the remains of a previously unknown type of human. Biography His parents were the innkeeper Johannes Philipp Fuhlrott and his wife Maria Magdalena, n√©e Nussbaum. His parents had died by the time he was ten and he was raised by his uncle, the Catholic priest Carl Bernhard Fuhlrott in Seulingen. In 1835 he married Josepha Amalia Kellner (1812‚Äì1850), with whom he had six children. After studying mathematics and natural sciences at the University of Bonn, Fuhlrott became a teacher at the Gymnasium in Elberfeld. In 1856, workers in a lime quarry in the nearby canyon called Gesteins or Neandertal (southwest of Mettmann) showed him bones they had found in a cave and thought to belong to a bear. Fuhlrott identified them as human and thought them to be very old. He recognized them to be different from the usual bones of humans and showed them to the Professor of Anatomy at the University of Bonn, Hermann Schaaffhausen. Together they announced the discovery publicly in 1857. In their view the bones represented the remnants of an ancient human race, different from contemporary humans. Their views were not readily accepted as it contradicted literal interpretations of the Bible, and Charles Darwin's work about evolution had not yet been published. Today, Fuhlrott and Schaaffhausen are considered to be the founders of paleoanthropology, and the taxon they discovered is referred to as Homo neanderthalensis in honor of the site where it was first identified.

It has an area of and has a population of 30,000 inhabitants of whom 10,000 are residents of the nearby town of Gran Alacant. The town has an important salt evaporation pond known as the salines which remains in business, additionally, most of it is recognized as the Natural Park of Salines de Santa Pola, an important RAMSAR site. The town was settled over the ruins of a Roman village called Portus Ilicitanus (literally, Harbour of Elche); after being abandoned for decades, then a castle was constructed in the 16th century which marked the repopulation of Santa Pola. The town has an archeological museum covering these phases. Santa Pola is, at present, a coastal fishing and tourist town. Population more than doubles during the summer, with people coming mostly from the rest of the Alicante province, and also from the Basque autonomous community, Madrid, France and the UK, just to mention some. The nearby island of Tabarca (part of Alicante) can be visited by ship. The new town of Gran Alacant, north of Santa Pola along the Alicante bay, accounts for about one third of the population of the district. Next to it is the Carabasi area, a nature reserve. Gran Alacant lies only a few kilometres from Alicante Airport and a few hundred metres from the town of Los Arenales which is located in the Elche district. In June 2009, the Valencian Government announced that the Alicante Tram system will be extended southwards via Alicante Airport and El Altet, to stations in Gran Alacant and Santa Pola and then onwards to Guardamar and Torrevieja before terminating in Murcia. Etymology The name is derived from Saint Paula, itself derived from Saint Paul the apostole, who arrived at Tabarca island, as tradition holds. However, it is likely that the name comes from Latin \\"palus\\", thence \\"pauls\\", finally \\"pol\\". History The first settlements in the area remount to the third millennium BC, proof of which have been tools and paintings from the Neolithic found in the Cueva de las Ara√±as del Carabass√≠, as well as remains found from hunter-gatherers of the Palaeolithic in the Cueva de las Teresitas. During the fourth century BCE, a small walled settlement was built near Vanalop√≥ river. It served mainly as a Greek-Iberia economical hub. During the first century CE, near the former site a port was built, serving the city of Illici, named Portus Illicitanus () (cited by Claudius Ptolemy in Geography). This port proved paramount for the development of the region's maritime commerce, together with Cartagena's. In 460 AC, emperor Mayoriano's flotilla set sail to attack north African vandals, but was burnt at that same port. From the Roman settlement a necropolis is still in place, as well as a fish-salting factory and the Roman House of Palmeral. Their remains are described as back as 1621 by Crist√≤fol Sanz, although they were excavated during the 20th century. Economics Economical activity in this region is based on agriculture, craft-making and fishing. 1.3% of the population was dedicated to agriculture in 2003, and that's only successful when coupled with artificial watering systems, needed for the 200 hectares of orange trees (102ha), mandarin trees (74ha), and pomegranate trees (18ha), together with 230ha used for vegetables such as melons, shallots, broccoli, etc. Languages According to article 35 of law n¬∞ 4/1983 (23 November), Santa Pola's official language is Valencian, together with Spanish (Spanish Constitution, article n¬∞3, 1978). INE's latest census shows that 90% of the population speaks Valencian. There has been an increased positive trend in the influx of new language influences, in part due to immigration patterns in the region. This has caused suburbs such as Gran Alacant to have a significant population of English speakers. Gallery File:Santa Pola. Castillo.

There is some debate as to the origin of the name Cowichan, which many believe to be an anglicized form of the First Nations tribal name Quw'utsun. Communities that lie within the actual Cowichan River/Cowichan Bay watershed include Duncan, Lake Cowichan, Cowichan Bay, Cowichan Station and Maple Bay. Other nearby communities are affiliated mainly through the Cowichan Valley Regional District. Crofton and Chemainus, lie within the Chemainus River Valley, while Cobble Hill, Shawnigan Lake, Mill Bay, and Ladysmith inhabit a coastal plain that includes the Cowichan and Chemainus River deltas. The Cowichan Valley is the home of a growing number of vineyards and wineries. They include Cherry Point Vineyards, Blue Grouse, Glenterra, Vigneti Zanatta, Venturi-Schulze, and Averill Creek. The warm, dry summers and mild, moist winters make this area part of Canada's only maritime Mediterranean climate, providing good growing conditions for many grape varietals. The Trans Canada Trail goes through the Valley, and there are numerous options for hiking enthusiasts. On January 7, 2010 an air quality monitoring station was installed.

Its headquarters is on Hope Road in Kingston, Jamaica. The group was formed in 1968 by Vernon Carrington.\\"And Tribes Made Merry\\", Jamaica Observer, 11 November 2013. Retrieved 11 November 2013 The twelve tribes are based on the teachings of the Bible. Members follow the teaching of reading the bible (the Scofield Reference Bible, King James Version) a chapter a day from Genesis 1 - Revelation 22, a teaching encouraged by the Carrington who was known to the organisation as \\"Prophet Gad\\". It is the most liberal of the Rastafarian orders and members are free to worship in a church or building of their choosing.  Beliefs  The Twelve Tribes of Israel teach salvation through the Messiyah Jesus Christ, whom they refer to as either Yahshua (His original Hebrew name) or Yesus Kritos (His name in the Amharic language). It is perhaps the Rastafari mansion closest in beliefs to Christianity or Messianic Judaism. Haile Selassie, Emperor of Ethiopia, is seen as a divinely anointed king in the lineage of Kings David and Solomon (Selassie's house being called the Solomonic dynasty). While he is considered a representation of \\"The Messiyah in Kingly Character\\", he is not seen as an incarnation of the Messiyah, nor as Jah Himself, but as a representative of the everlasting Davidic covenant, which is to be fulfilled by Yesus Kristos upon his return as The Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah (Yahudah). Members of the Twelve Tribes of Israel, like all other Rastafarians, reject the consumption of alcohol, refrain from cutting their hair, and avoid the dead and anything having to do with death, as a part of the Nazirite vows. They also keep the Sabbath, and follow Ital dietary laws.  Organization and practices  The headquarters of the Twelve Tribes of Israel organisation in Shashamane, Ethiopia Each member of this sect belongs to one of the Twelve Tribes, which is determined by Gregorian birth month and is represented by a color, a part of the body, and a character trait, often called a \\"faculty.\\" The standard Israelite calendar begins in April; the twelve tribes being Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Zebulun, Dan, Gad, Asher, Naphtali, Joseph, and Benjamin. Although the twelve representations apply to male and female alike, Dinah, though not considered a tribe, is representative of the feminine. Members of this order are not required to be turbaned; however, they do wear red, gold, and green banners at meetings, during prayer and Bible readings as a holy garment. The Twelve Tribes of Israel functions internationally and has headquarters in various countries. Members work towards repatriation to Africa, mainly Ethiopia (Shashamane) Bob Marley was a noted member. Other artists associated with the group include Sangie Davis, Fred Locks, Little Roy, and Pablove Black. The group had an association with the Jah Love sound system in the 1970s.

Early career Buckingham Palace as completed by Blore in 1850. It was later refaced and altered by Sir Aston Webb in 1913. Vorontsov Palace in Alupka, Crimea, Ukraine. Government House, Sydney, Australia. He was born in Derby, the son of the antiquarian writer Thomas Blore. Blore's background was in antiquarian draughtsmanship rather than architecture, in which he had no formal training. Nevertheless, he designed a large palace for Count Vorontsov in Alupka, Crimea (see 'Later career', below) and important ecclesiastical furnishings designed by him included organ cases for Winchester Cathedral and Peterborough Cathedral (the Peterborough case since removed) and the choir stalls in Westminster Abbey. Charles Locke Eastlake, writing in 1872, believed that he had been apprenticed to an engraver,Eastlake 1873, p.138 but other sources dispute this. He illustrated his father's History of Rutland (1811), and over the next few years he made the drawings of York and Peterborough and measured drawings of Winchester for John Britton's English Cathedrals, and drew architectural subjects for various county histories. In around 1822 Blore supplied the illustrations to Thomas Frognall Dibdin's Aedes Althorpian√¶. In 1823 he toured Northern England, making drawings for a work called the Monumental Remains of Noble and Eminent Persons. It was issued in parts with text by the Rev. Philip Bliss, and completed in 1826. Blore engraved many of the plates himself.Eastlake 1873, p.138‚Äî9 Westminster Abbey and Lambeth Palace In 1826, he was appointed Surveyor of the Fabric of Westminster Abbey.Eastlake 1873, p.139 The following year he was engaged to furnish plans for the chancel fittings of Peterborough Cathedral. Shortly afterwards he was employed to restore Lambeth Palace, then in a state of near ruin. His work there included the construction of a fire- proof room for the preservation of manuscripts and archives.Eastlake 1873, p.140 Eastlake praised Blore's careful detail in his work at Westminster Abbey, adding \\"this was, in short, his great forte. He had studied and drawn detail so long and zealously that its design came quite naturally to him, and in this respect he was incomparably superior to his contemporaries\\".Eastlake 1873, p.141 Later career Blore is most notable for his completion of John Nash's design of Buckingham Palace, following Nash's dismissal. He completed the palace in a style similar to but plainer than that intended by Nash. In 1847, Blore returned to the palace and designed the great facade facing The Mall thus enclosing the central quadrangle. He also worked on St James's Palace in London, and a large number of other designs in both England and Scotland, including restoring the Salisbury Tower at Windsor Castle. Blore was a personal friend of Sir Walter Scott, having been introduced by Daniel Terry, and like Scott was interested in the baronial architecture of Scottish castles. This led to Prince Vorontsov's invitation to design his extensive Vorontsov's Palace in Alupka, Crimea (now Russian Federation). The Alupka palace was built between 1828 and 1846, in a mixture of styles ranging from Gothic Revival to Moorish Revival. The palace's guidebook describes the building as \\"Blore's tribute to Muslim architecture\\". The structure features two fa√ßades, contrasting \\"the starkness of Scottish Baronial on its landward side with Arabian fantasy facing the sea\\". As a recognised establishment architect, Blore was involved in many projects related to the British Empire; this included Government House in Sydney, Australia, which he designed in 1834 in the form of a Gothic castle. Such designs were unusual and display a more adventurous side to Blore's work than can be seen from his work in London. His East front, the public face, of Buckingham Palace was criticised from the moment of its completion as banal street architecture, a view shared by King George V who had the facade redesigned by Sir Aston Webb in 1913. Around 1840 Blore was possibly responsible for alterations at Wythenshawe Hall. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1841. Death Blore died at home in 4 Manchester Square, London, on 4 September 1879, and was buried in Highgate Cemetery (West), Highgate, London. Students The architects Philip Charles Hardwick and Frederick Marrable and Henry Clutton were his pupils. William Mason worked for him before going to Australia and New Zealand.

The war streamer (gu√æfana genumen), also cited in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and nowadays known as raven banner, which appears on the Bayeux Tapestry. Campaign streamers are decorations attached to military flags to recognize particular achievements or events of a military unit or service. Attached to the headpiece of the assigned flag, the streamer often is an inscribed ribbon with the name and date denoting participation in a particular battle, military campaign, or theater of war; the ribbon's colors are chosen accordingly and frequently match an associated campaign medal or ribbon bar. They often are physical manifestations of battle honours, though this does not mean all streamers are battle honours (e.g. gala or parade streamers not connected to a battle). They should not be confused with a tassel, which is usually purely decorative in nature. The armed forces of Germany, the United States and others have engaged in awarding streamers. Historically Prussia, Austria-Hungary and the Soviet Union have also used streamers in this manner. United States Display of streamers from the flag of the United States Marine Corps Display of Streamers on US Army Flags, Colors and Guidons Background The United States Army established campaign streamers in 1920, the United States Marine Corps in 1939, the United States Air Force in 1956. The United States Coast Guard adopted battle streamers in 1968, with the United States Navy following suit in 1971. Usage Many of the practices relative to streamers and their display are similar among the services. There are, however, differences, particularly regarding the number of streamers and use of embroidered devices. The Army carries a separate streamer for each important action in all wars in which that service has participated, each embroidered with the name of the action commemorated. Currently, the Army allows 190 streamers, and the Air Force, employing the Army system, carries more than 60. Unlike the Army-Air Force practice, the Marines and Navy use one ribbon for each war, campaign, or theater of operations. Specific actions or battles are highlighted by bronze and silver stars embroidered on the ribbon. The Marine Corps has 50 streamers, the Navy 36, and the Coast Guard uses 43, unadorned by either stars or lettering. Stars on the Marines and Navy streamers follow the practice initiated during the World War II period for ribbons and medals‚Äîthat is, a bronze service star for each action, and a silver star in lieu of five bronze stars. The Navy applies stars to appropriate ribbons throughout its history, whereas the Marine Corps uses stars to commemorate service starting from 1900. The Navy's Presidential Unit Citation, Navy Unit Commendation, and Meritorious Unit Commendation streamers each carry a red number rather than stars, representing the number of times that the respective award has been conferred upon Navy units. Appearance U.S. streamers tend to have a flat end, with writing, with the sole exception being those of the USMC, whose streamers usually have a pointed end with no writing. The fly end of the streamer usually has a swallowtail. =Size= U.S. streamers' sizes vary based upon the military branch that uses them and the size of the flag that they are attached to. Generally they are long and wide; the USMC's streamers are wide and either or long. =Colors= Where a medal has been awarded for a particular war or service, the coloring and design of the streamer are the same as the ribbon from which the medal is suspended. Conflicts and operations for which no medal was issued have ribbons specially designed for use as streamers.

While it is a sequel to the 2001 television series, Meteor Garden which is based on Japanese sh≈çjo manga series, , Meteor Garden II is an original series that is not based on the Manga. It was produced by Comic Ritz International Production with Angie Chai (Êü¥Êô∫Â±è) as producer and directed by Wang Ming-tai. The series was broadcast in Taiwan on free-to-air Chinese Television System (CTS) (ËèØË¶ñ) from 11 November 2002 to 25 December 2002. The prequel Meteor Garden was broadcast from 12 April 2001 to 16 August 2001 and a supplementary mini-series, Meteor Rain, was produced in 2001 and broadcast following the main series. This is the second live-action television adaptation of the manga, following its prequel Meteor Garden and followed by Japanese Hana Yori Dango, its sequel Hana Yori Dango Returns and South Korean Boys Over Flowers. However, it follows an original story penned by writer-producer Angie Chai when the rights to use the F4 name was extended. Despite the increased budget and new lead cast member Michelle Saram, the series received mixed fan reactions due to the original storyline which deviated greatly from the original manga. Synopsis The story opens with the graduation of F4 from Ying De University and subsequently focuses on their life after graduation. It follows the blossoming love story of Shan Cai (Barbie Shu) and Dao Ming Si (Jerry Yan). The story takes the group to Barcelona where Dao Ming Si had a car accident and suffers memory loss. He then meets another girl, Ye Sha (Michelle Saram), the driver of the other car. Shan Cai on the other hand tries her best to help Dao Ming Si regain his memory. A swimming accident helps Dao Ming Si regain his memory and returns to his first love Shan Cai.

Bellovin and Michael Merritt. Although several of the forms of EKE in this paper were later found to be flawed , the surviving, refined, and enhanced forms of EKE effectively make this the first method to amplify a shared password into a shared key, where the shared key may subsequently be used to provide a zero- knowledge password proof or other functions. In the most general form of EKE, at least one party encrypts an ephemeral (one-time) public key using a password, and sends it to a second party, who decrypts it and uses it to negotiate a shared key with the first party. A second paper describes Augmented-EKE, and introduced the concept of augmented password-authenticated key agreement for client/server scenarios. Augmented methods have the added goal of ensuring that password verification data stolen from a server cannot be used by an attacker to masquerade as the client, unless the attacker first determines the password (e.g. by performing a brute force attack on the stolen data). A version of EKE based on Diffie‚ÄìHellman, known as DH-EKE, has survived attack and has led to improved variations, such as the PAK family of methods in IEEE P1363.2.

Navistar operates as the owner of International brand of trucks and diesel engines. The company also produces military vehicles through its Navistar Defense subsidiary along with bus production through IC Bus. Currently, Traton SE (formerly Volkswagen Truck and Bus) is the largest stakeholder of Navistar, owning 17% of the company. Headquartered in Lisle, Illinois, the company has 13,000 employees worldwide as of 2019. Navistar operates through a network of nearly 1,000 dealer outlets in the United States, Canada, Brazil, and Mexico and more than 60 dealers in 90 countries throughout the world. The company also provides financing for its customers and distributors principally through its wholly owned subsidiary, Navistar Financial Corporation. History Navistar International headquarters building in Lisle, IL. 1902‚Äì1985: International Harvester The merger of McCormick Harvesting Machine Company and the Deering Harvester Company in 1902 resulted in the formation of the International Harvester Company (IH) of Chicago, Illinois. In 1908, International introduced the International Harvester Auto Wagon, a forerunner of the pickup truck. Over the next three-quarters of the 20th century, the company evolved to become a diversified manufacturer within the agricultural and construction industries and produced vehicles ranging from the Scout and Travelall light trucks to heavy commercial trucks and buses. Other brands associated with the company include Farmall and Cub Cadet. 1985‚Äì1991: Transition from agricultural roots International Harvester fell on hard times during the poor agricultural economy in the early to mid-1980s and the effects of a long strike with the UAW over proposed work rule changes. IH's new CEO, Donald Lennox, directed the management organization to begin exiting many of its IH's historical business sectors in an effort to survive. Some of the sales of profitable business endeavors were executed to raise cash for short-term survival, while other divisions were sold due to a lack of immediate profitability. During this period of questionable economic survival, in an effort to raise needed cash and to reduce losses, the management team led by Mr. Lennox at IH shed many of its operating divisions: Construction Equipment Division to Dresser Industries; Solar (gas turbines) Division to Caterpillar; Cub Cadet (lawn and garden equipment) to MTD Products. For the 1983 model year, the Engine Division began production of 6.9L IDI V8 diesel engines for Ford full-size pickup trucks and vans; the supply agreement would last through 2010. At the beginning of 1985, the Agricultural Division was acquired by Tenneco, leaving the final pieces of International Harvester as the Truck and Engine Divisions. The IHC name and logo were assets of the Agricultural Division and were consequently part of the sale. The parent company of rival Case Corporation, Tenneco created the merged Case IH (continuing the IH brand to this day). In response to the sale of its own brand and logo, International Harvester reintroduced itself on February 20, 1986, as Navistar International Corporation. To this day, the \\"International\\" brand name is used by the product lines of the International Truck and Engine Corporation (the previous Truck and Engine Division). 1990s-early 2000s: Rediversification In 1991, the final remnant of International in the automotive segment was sold off, as the Scout and Light Truck parts business was sold to Scout/Light Line Distributors, Inc. During the 1980s and 1990s, the popularity of diesel engines had made Navistar a leading manufacturer of bus chassis, particularly school buses. The company purchased one-third of American Transportation Corporation (AmTran), an Arkansas-based manufacturer in 1991, and the remaining two-thirds in April 1995. By becoming both a body and chassis manufacturer at the same time, Navistar gained significant market share in the industry. During the 1994 model year, the T444E engine replaced the IDI diesel in Ford vehicles; still supplied by Navistar, the 7.3L V8 turbodiesel adopted the PowerStroke branding for Ford vehicles. 2000s After nearly a century of business in Chicago, Navistar announced its plans on 30 September 2000 to leave the city and relocate its corporate offices to west suburban Warrenville, Illinois. In 2002, AmTran was rebranded as IC (Integrated Coach) after a few months as International Truck and Bus. In 2001, International introduced the first \\"NGV\\" trucks, its first completely new truck design since the 1986 introduction of Navistar. Initially using the \\"Thousand\\"-series nomenclature, in 2008, the NGV trucks adopted -\\"Star\\" branding (only the 9000-series remained). XT pickup trucks In 2004, Navistar re-entered the retail vehicle market for the first time since 1980, with the International XT (Extreme Truck) series. Three pickup trucks were sold; two of the three versions (CXT and RXT) were International Durastar medium-duty trucks (fitted with Ford F-350 pickup beds). The third version (the MXT) was essentially a street-legal version of the Navistar-designed International MXT-MV military vehicle. (By far) the largest vehicles ever sold for consumer sale, the XT series was sold through the 2008 model year. In 2005, Navistar purchased the Workhorse company (started in 1998 by investors who took over production and sales of General Motors‚Äô popular P-series Stepvan chassis when GM dropped it), a manufacturer of step-van and motor home chassis, to seemingly re-enter the delivery van market. It appeared that the new subsidiary might also benefit by its association with a company whose history from the 1930s into the '60s included the popular Metro van. For a short time Workhorse offered an integrated chassis-body product called MetroStar. In Sept. of 2012, Navistar announced the shut down of Workhorse and the closure of the plant in Union City, Indiana, in order to cut costs. Workhorse has since repositioned itself as a manufacturer of electrically powered trucks and delivery vans. =2001 shooting= On February 5, 2001, the company's Melrose Park facility was the site of a workplace shooting. 66-year-old William D. Baker opened fire with an AK-47 killing four co-workers and injuring four more before turning the gun on himself. Baker was just a day away from incarceration for stealing from his ex-employer.  2010s-present Move to Lisle, Illinois= In September 2010, despite uncertainty over EGR and a sluggish economy, Navistar leadership revived an effort to relocate the company headquarters from Warrenville, IL, to nearby Lisle, IL. The new headquarters was expected to retain or create 3,000 permanent jobs and about 400 construction jobs. Navistar President Dan Ustian said roughly 500 engineers would be hired immediately. Navistar aimed to invest $110 million in the 1.2 million-square- foot Lisle campus, which would include product development. The state gave Navistar incentives of nearly $65 million, including tax credits. In March 2011, Navistar announced the move to Lisle. Renovations were completed in the fall, but the company gradually moved from Warrenville to Lisle in summer 2011. \\"You can't build a campus like this anywhere for anywhere near the price we paid for this, and even though you might get more incentives, when you look at the whole picture, you really can't beat it,\\" said Don Sharp, Navistar vice president. In 2011, Navistar began phasing out its Truck Development and Technology Center (TDTC) in Fort Wayne, Indiana. In early December 2011, the company laid off 130 employees, mostly engineers and designers who were United Auto Workers members. In total, 300 out of 1,400 Fort Wayne employees eventually accepted offers to relocate to Illinois. The other 1,100 workers either retired or chose to remain in Indiana and find work elsewhere. The cost to move employees and consolidate operations was estimated to be $75 million. The only Navistar employees remaining after December 2012 were 20-25 people manning the company's test track on Oxford Street. In late July 2015, the TDTC closed and the remaining workers were let go. =Tension Mounts= In June 2012, speculation mounted about a possible takeover of the struggling truck maker. This came as hedge fund MHR Fund Management LLC disclosed a 13.6% stake in the company, slightly higher than billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn's 11.9% stake. As a result, Navistar adopted a poison pill defense. If the plan were triggered by an outside investor taking a stake of 15 percent or more in the company, then Navistar would issue its shareholders rights that would let them buy new common stock in the company at a discount of 50 percent: For each share held, the investor could buy $280 worth of new shares for $140. The investor who took the 15 percent stake or more would not have the right to buy additional shares. In August 2012, Navistar announced it would use Cummins engines and SCR technology. After 37 years with the company, Dan Ustian retired immediately in August 2012 and left his position on the board as well. Former Textron CEO Lewis Campbell was named interim CEO and Troy Clarke was promoted to Chief Operating Officer. Ustian's severance package began at $7.9 million. The company's proxy statement during this time estimated the total package to be $14.6 million, contingent on a share price of $42.07 on Oct. 31, 2011, the end of the company's fiscal year. On September 9, 2012, billionaire and key stock holder Carl Icahn sent an open letter to Navistar's board, blasting them for \\"abysmal business decisions\\" and \\"poor corporate governance.\\" Icahn noted from 2009 to 2012, that \\"this Board has authorized spending shareholder money on lawsuits against suppliers, competitors and regulators, marketing plans to convince customers that non- compliant engines are actually compliant, accumulating non-core assets such as a Recreational Vehicle manufacturer, and a \\"gold-plated\\" corporate headquarters that cost over $100 million. The one thing this Board refused to spend money on was a back-up plan involving the industry standard technology Navistar now must rely on.\\" In a September 2012 interview, Cummins CEO Tom Linebarger said, \\"all we did was act nice to them (Navistar) even when they didn't talk nicely about us,\\" he smiled, recalling harsh comments that Navistar executives had made about SCR being used by all its competitors. In October 2012, Chief Product Officer Deepak Kapur stepped down, followed by Group Vice President of Product Development Ramin Younessi in December 2012. CIO Don Sharp also left the company in April 2013. =Layoffs and consolidation= August 2012 featured a Voluntary Separation Program (VSP) as well as involuntary layoffs. This was due to the failed engine strategy, rising warranty costs and declines in commercial and military sales. The company let go 500 employees and in September 2012, announced plans to lay off 200 more salaried employees. In addition, the company announced it would close its Garland, Texas manufacturing facility by mid-2013, resulting in the loss of 900 jobs. In March 2013, Navistar announced that interim CEO Lewis Campbell would step down and COO Troy Clarke would be named CEO and Chairman of the Board. Jack Allen was named COO. In June 2013, CFO A.J. Cederoth stepped down and James M. Moran, Navistar senior vice president, and treasurer, would act as interim CFO until a successor could be found. In late June 2013, former General Motors executive Walter Borst was named Executive VP and CFO. In September 2013, Navistar announced it would cut 500 more jobs amid a larger than expected third-quarter loss. Navistar reported a slower than expected return to profitability due to large market share losses, declining sales, and weak market conditions. In May 2014, a third round of lay-offs in as many years occurred at the corporate headquarters as part of ongoing cost-cutting measures. On July 31, 2015, Navistar ceased operations and laid off the remaining 15 employees at the Truck Development and Technology Center (TDTC) in Fort Wayne, Indiana. In November 2015 and December 2015, several hundred Navistar employees voluntarily left the Corporate HQ office in Lisle, IL, as part of another Voluntary Separation Package (VSP). =Cost-cutting and divestitures= As part of the turnaround plan, Navistar executives cut costs aggressively. They cut SG&A; costs by 16% in 2013 and cut product development spending by 24%. Interim CEO Lewis Campbell's priorities included a focus on quality, reducing the company's cost structure and paring back its product line. Navistar also sold several businesses that it deemed were not providing enough of a Return On Invested Capital (ROIC). Among them were their Monaco Coach Corporation Recreational Vehicle (RV) business as well as Workhorse Chassis. They also exited their joint venture with Mahindra and sold off their E-Z Pack unit, which made bodies for garbage trucks, as well as its Continental Mixer unit, which made concrete mixers, for prices the company characterized as \\"not material.\\" In January 2014, Forbes reported several key challenges facing Navistar, which include declining military sales, a pension plan underfunded by $2.7 billion, two self-disclosed weaknesses in accounting practices and a new collective bargaining agreement for the company's 6,000 full and part-time workers who are represented by labor unions. In February 2014, Navistar announced it would move some engine production operations from Huntsville, AL, to Melrose Park, IL by summer 2014. The move eliminated 280 jobs in Alabama and saved an estimated $22 million. Navistar said it would keep two other diesel engine plants operating in Huntsville. In September 2014, Navistar reported its best quarter in years. It announced a third- quarter net loss of $2 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, compared to a third-quarter 2013 net loss of $247 million, or $3.06 per diluted share. It was also in September that CEO Troy Clarke announced that the company's biggest divestitures were complete, and that the focus would now be on regaining lost market share. On November 6, 2014, leadership changes continued at Navistar, with Executive VP and COO Jack Allen retiring immediately. Rather than hire a new COO, CEO Troy Clarke split the COO duties among three other executives. = GM and Navistar Reach Commercial Vehicle Agreement = General Motors Co. and Navistar have reached a long-term agreement to develop and assemble future medium-duty, conventional cab Class 4/5 commercial vehicles, allowing Navistar to strengthen its product lineup and GM to expand its Chevrolet commercial truck portfolio. The future trucks will be jointly developed using Navistar's expertise in rolling chassis configurations and manufacturing capabilities, and GM's commercial components and engines. The vehicles entered production in late 2018 and are manufactured at Navistar's facility in Springfield, Ohio. =Strategic partnership with Traton SE= In September 2016, Navistar and Volkswagen Truck and Bus (now called Traton), the subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group that controls European heavy truck makers MAN and Scania, announced their intent to pursue a strategic technology collaboration and to establish a procurement joint venture. Volkswagen Truck & Bus would take a 16.6% stake in Navistar, in return for an investment of $256 million. Navistar expects to realize cumulative synergies of $500 million over the first five years. In March 2017 it was announced that Volkswagen Truck & Bus's 16.6% equity investment in Navistar became effective from February 28, 2017, with Volkswagen Truck & Bus executives Andreas Renschler and Matthias Gr√ºndler joining the Navistar Board of Directors. On January 30, 2020, Traton announced a proposal to purchase all outstanding shares in Navistar. Corporate operations=International Trucks (1986-present) DuraStar Box (van body) truck International LT International WorkStar (vacuum truck) In 1986, after the transition from International Harvester to Navistar, the truck product line (essentially all that was left) dropped the \\"Harvester\\" portion of the brand name. The International brand encompasses a variety of medium- duty, over-the-road, and severe-service trucks. ;Medium Duty * International CV Series (also produced as Chevrolet Silverado C6500 HD) * International MV Series ;Heavy Duty * International LoneStar * International LT Series * International RH Series ;Severe Duty * International HX Series * International HV Series IC Bus (2002-present) IC Bus AC-Series (International TerraStar) shuttle bus International has a long history in the school bus industry as a chassis provider, dating to when school buses first became motorized. In 1991, Navistar entered the school bus industry as a body manufacturer when it began its acquisition of AmTran, an Arkansas-based company founded as Ward Body Works in 1933. Today, IC Bus produces several models of full-sized school buses along with buses for commercial use. ;School/activity buses * CE-Series conventional (International 3300 chassis) * RE-Series rear-engine transit-style (International 3000 chassis) ;Commercial buses * CE-Series conventional (International 3300 chassis) * RE-Series rear- engine transit-style (International 3000 chassis) * TC-Series chassis (International 3300 chassis) MWM International Motores (2005-present) In 2005, Navistar purchased MWM International Motores, a Brazilian engine manufacturer formerly associated with Deutz AG. Engines (1986-present) In 1986, Navistar was formed from the engine division of the former International Harvester (alongside the truck division). In a continuation from its predecessor, International produced both gasoline and diesel-fueled engines for its medium-duty trucks and some heavy-duty trucks, offering second-party engines as an option. Class 8 trucks offered second-party diesel engines (from Caterpillar, Cummins, and Detroit Diesel). From International Harvester, International inherited production of the SV-series gasoline V8, IDI diesel V8, DV-series diesel V8, and DT466 inline-6. After 1986, the production of gasoline engines ended, shifting to diesel-powered engines entirely. During the 1980s, Navistar began an expansion of its engine families. For 1986, a 7.3L version of the IDI was introduced; the engine supplanted the long-running DV-series V8 by the end of 1988; the same year, it became an option in Ford trucks. For 1987, the DT inline-6 engine family was expanded to a second engine, as the DT360 was introduced (competing directly against the Cummins 6BT). During 1994 production, the IDI V8 was replaced by the direct-injection T444E V8, sharing little more than its displacement with its predecessor; the T444E became the first Ford PowerStroke engine. While the DT360 was withdrawn (largely replaced by the T444E), the DT466 (now the DT466E) was joined by the larger DT530E (competing primarily against the Cummins C8.3). For the 2000s, International began developing engines to comply with updated emissions standards for commercial vehicles. During 2003, the T444E was discontinued and replaced the VT engine family, introduced by the VT365 V8. For 2004, the DT engines received modernized fuel injection and a redesigned turbocharger; the DT530 was replaced by the DT570 (sized between the Caterpillar C9 and the Cummins ISL). In place of using Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) to treat engine emissions, International adopted Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR), a configuration used with success in automobiles with gasoline engines. For 2007 emissions compliance, International launched the \\"MaxxForce\\" branding for its diesel engines. The VT engine family consisted of the 4.5L MaxxForce 5 V6 and the 6.4L MaxxForce 7 V8 (replacing the VT365). The DT466 became the MaxxForceDT, with the DT and HT570 becoming the MaxxForce 9 and 10, respectively. For its Class 8 trucks, the company introduced \\"large- bore\\" engines for the first time, introducing the 10.5L MaxxForce 11 and the 12.4L MaxxForce 13. After the 2010 model year, Ford ended its engine supply agreement with International, continuing the PowerStroke range under its own designs. The MaxxForce 7 and DT engines were updated with twin turbochargers to improve emissions compliance. Following several years of difficulty reliably matching 2007 and 2010 emissions compliance, International chose to end diesel engine production following the 2015 model year, replacing the MaxxForce 7 and MaxxForceDT with the Cummins ISB6.7 and ISL9, respectively. In 2017, International reentered the diesel engine production segment, launching the A26 12.4L inline-6. Largely serving as a company-produced successor to the MaxxForce 13, the A26 was developed from the MAN D26 engine. Plug-in electric vehicles eStar electric van in Los Angeles in 2010. The vehicle was manufactured in the U.S. under license from Modec. eStar delivery truck in Washington, D.C. in 2012 =Plug-in hybrid electric bus= The U.S. Department of the Energy announced in 2009 the selection of Navistar Corporation for a cost-shared award of up to million to develop, test, and deploy plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) school buses. The project aims to deploy 60 vehicles for a three-year period in school bus fleets across the nation. The vehicles will be capable of running in either electric-only or hybrid modes that can be recharged from standard electrical outlets. Because electricity will be their primary fuel, they will consume less petroleum than standard vehicles. To develop the PHEV school bus, Navistar will examine a range of hybrid architectures and evaluate advanced energy storage devices, with the goal of developing a vehicle with a range. Travel beyond the range will be facilitated by a clean diesel engine capable of running on renewable fuels. The DOE funding will cover up to half of the project's cost and will be provided over three years, subject to annual appropriations. =eStar electric van= The eStar was an all-electric van. Production began in March 2010 and first deliveries began two months later via its Workhorse Group division. The technology used in eStar was licensed to Navistar in 2009 in a joint venture with Modec and Navistar bought the intellectual property rights from the Modec's bankruptcy administrators in 2011. The introduction of the eStar was supported by a million U.S. Department of Energy stimulus grant under the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The eStar had a payload capacity available with a 14- or 16-foot cargo box. The vehicle was powered by a 70 kW 102 hp electric motor powered by an 80kWhr lithium-ion battery pack supplied by A123 Systems, and also used regenerative braking. The electric van had a range of , and a full charge took between 6 and 8 hours. By May 2010 the eStar had received U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and CARB certifications. The eStar also met all Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS). The first vans were delivered in May 2010 to FedEx Express for use in Los Angeles. Other customers included Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E;), The Coca-Cola Company, and Canada Post. The eStar had a price of . Navistar discontinued the eStar van in March 2013, as part of a corporate restructuring plan to focus on current profitability. Navistar Defense LLC (2003-present) International MaxxPro MRAP In October 2003, Navistar CEO Dan Ustian announced the company would be forming a defense business unit in order to sell military vehicles. Navistar Defense would be led by Archie Massicotte, a 26-year veteran of the company. Ustian stated \\"This is a natural area of growth for International. We already have all the platforms that the U.S. military and other NATO countries could leverage for products and services.\\" In 2007, Navistar's International Truck and Engine Corporation became the first company to enter hybrid commercial truck production, with the International DuraStar Hybrid diesel-electric truck.International Truck and Engine First Company to Enter Hybrid Commercial Truck Production, November 9, 2007, Fuerteventura Digital Navistar Defense LLC is the prime supplier of MRAP armored vehicles to the US military. The Navistar 7000 series has been fielded by the Canadian Forces for domestic operations. In 2005, the U.S. Army ordered 2,900 7000-MVs for the Afghan National Army and Iraqi Ministry of Defense and an additional order of 7,000 was added in 2008. Navistar Defense also has a small Canadian branch, named Navistar Defence Canada. Navistar Defense reported sales of $3.9 billion in 2008 and $2.8 billion in 2009. In October 2009, the company entered into a strategic agreement with Czech-based company Tatra to jointly develop, produce and market new military vehicles. In December 2009, analysts were skeptical of the company's long-term potential. \\"Navistar came out of nowhere and became a big player with MRAP, in what was a short-term program,\\" said Dean Lockwood, an analyst at Forecast International Inc., a Connecticut-based defense consultant. \\"They didn't prove themselves to be a long-term major player.\\" In 2010, Navistar Defense's sales were $1.8 billion. The company's 2010 Annual 10K report stated \\"we continue to expect that over the long term our military business will generate approximately $1.5 billion to $2 billion in annual sales.\\" In 2011, Navistar Defense's sales were $2.0 billion. In 2012, Navistar Defense reported $1.0 billion in sales. Business Insider ranked Navistar Defense at 22 in the top 25 US defense companies. In 2013, Navistar Defense reported $543 million in sales. In the company's 10K filing, they projected military sales to continue to decline, citing U.S. budgetary constraints.In 2014, we expect our U.S. military sales to continue to decline. Contributing to the decline are the budgetary constraints experienced by the U.S. government. In 2014, Navistar Defense reported $149 million in sales. The company projected 2015 military sales to be slightly higher due to recent contract awards relating to the government's MRAP fleet. In 2015, Navistar Defense reported $203 million in sales. The 2015 military sales primarily consisted of refurbishment and upgrades of government-owned MaxxPro vehicles to ‚Äúlike new‚Äù condition, upgrade kits, spare parts, and technical support services. The company projected 2016 sales to be slightly higher than 2015 due to a recent new vehicle contract award, additional refurbishment and upgrades of government-owned MaxxPro vehicles and technical support services. In 2016's annual report, Navistar Defense reported $198 million in sales. The 2016 military sales primarily consisted of deliveries of MILCOT variants to foreign militaries, refurbishment and upgrades of government-owned MaxxPro vehicles to ‚Äúlike new‚Äù condition, upgrade kits, spare parts, and technical support services. In 2017, ND said they expect their U.S. military sales to be consistent with 2016 as their contract backlog consists of a similar mix of products as that of 2016.In 2017, we expect our U.S. military sales to be consistent with 2016 as our contract backlog consists of a similar mix of products as that of 2016. =Subpoena from U.S. DOD Inspector General= In third-quarter 2016, Navistar Defense said it received a subpoena from the United States Department of Defense Inspector General asking for documents related to the sale of some independent suspension systems to the government. Navistar Defense said it would comply. The subpoena is related to the independent suspension systems sold for military vehicles between Jan. 1, 2009 and Dec. 31, 2010. On June 3, 2016, ND met with government representatives, including representatives from DOD IG and the U.S. Department of Justice, to discuss the matter. ND made submissions of documents responsive to the subpoena in June and August 2016 and has substantially completed its subpoena response. =Contract awards, losses and other events= On August 22, 2012, Navistar Defense lost their bid for the Engineering, Manufacturing & Development (EMD) contract worth $187 million for the Army and Marine Corps' Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) program. Navistar had proposed its Saratoga vehicle for the competition. On Friday, August 28, 2012, Navistar filed a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) but pulled their protest on Tuesday, September 4, 2012. =2013= On June 20, 2013, Navistar Defense idled production at their West Point, MS production plant. 80 workers were notified that July 5, 2013, would be their last day. West Point was best known for manufacturing MRAP vehicles. The company cited sequestration, the drawdown in Afghanistan and a challenging environment in the defense industry as factors. On August 22, 2013, Navistar Defense lost their bid for the Ground Mobility Vehicle (GMV) 1.1 contract, potentially valued at $562 million. Navistar had proposed its Special Operations Tactical Vehicle (SOTV) for the competition. On Tuesday September 1, 2013, Navistar Defense and AM General filed a protest. On December 19, 2013, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) denied Navistar and AM General's protests. =2014= In January 2014, the Pentagon announced they had notified allies of their intent to give away or scrap 13,000 used MRAPs. This was due to the war in Afghanistan winding down, the military wanting a lighter vehicle and high cost to ship them from the Middle East back to the U.S. Recipients have included various police departments and some universities. Navistar Defense built 9,000 of the 27,000 vehicles bought by the Pentagon. Giving away the MRAPs was seen as a blow to Navistar Defense's parts sales. In December 2014, Navistar Defense lost their bid for the Engineering, Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract for the Armored Multi- Purpose Vehicle (AMPV). BAE was awarded the $382 million contract on December 23, 2014. Navistar Defense lost their bid for Canada's Department of National Defence (DND) MSVS (Medium Support Vehicle System) Project - SMP (Standard Military Pattern) vehicle contracts. They proposed their ATX8 vehicle as part of an agreement with Czech-based company Tatra. The contract was for acquisition and in-service support (ISS) of a fleet of up to 1,500 SMP vehicles, up to 150 Armour Protection Systems (APS) kits, and 300 Load Handling System (LHS) trailers. Competitors include Oshkosh (MTVR), BAE Systems (FMTV), Daimler AG (Zetros), Renault Trucks (Kerax 8x8) and Rheinmetall/ MAN (HX77 8x8). A contract award decision is expected in June 2015. On July 16, 2015, Canada awarded the Acquisition and In-Service Support contracts to Mack Defense, LLC (Renault Trucks). On July 25, 2014, the DOD awarded a $27.6 million modification to an existing contract to acquire mine- resistant, ambush-protected hardware kits to upgrade MaxxPro Dash and long- wheelbase ambulances to their final configuration. Estimated completion date is May 30, 2015. On August 27, 2014, the DOD awarded a $38 million contract to Navistar Defense to restore MRAP Maxx Pro Dash vehicles to \\"like-new\\" standards. The DOD reported that Navistar was the only bidder. The work includes adding independent suspension systems and replacement of mandatory parts, with an estimated completion date of June 30, 2016. Work will be performed in West Point, MS. In September 2014, Navistar Defense announced they would hire 200 workers and re-open operations at their West Point, MS production plant. West Point had been idle since June 2013 due to sequestration, the drawdown in Afghanistan and declining orders. In September 2014, amidst numerous divestitures, Navistar Inc. CEO Troy Clark gave Navistar Defense a vote of confidence, noting that the military business unit would be retained. In a September 2014 interview with Reuters, he said \\"it's not a billion-dollar growth opportunity, but it's not something that‚Äôs bleeding off the future fortunes of our company.\\" On October 14, 2014, Navistar Defense was awarded a $9.2 million firm-fixed-price foreign military sale (FMS) contract to Jordan for one hundred 4-ton 4x4 cargo trucks and twenty days of operator and maintenance training.

Joint ventures= Current General Motors= 2019‚Äì2020 International CV chassis cab Navistar entered into an agreement to purchase General Motors' medium duty truck unit in 2007, but because of changing market conditions the purchase ultimately did not occur, and production of the Chevrolet Kodiak and GMC TopKick were discontinued in 2009 as GM entered bankruptcy protection. In 2015, a joint venture between the two companies for development of a new Class 4/5 commercial vehicle was announced. In early 2017, Navistar's truck assembly plant in Springfield, Ohio, began production of cutaway van chassis variants of the GMT610 Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana. Further details around the Chevy Silverado 4500HD/5500HD/6500HD were announced by General Motors early in 2018, with Navistar also unveiling the International-branded variant of the truck, the CV series, shortly thereafter. Production started in late 2018. The truck serves as a successor to the previously discontinued Chevrolet Kodiak and International TerraStar, competing against the Ford Super Duty F-450/F-550/F-600 and Ram Chassis Cab. =Tatra= Tatra and Navistar Defence introduced at Eurosatory Exposition in Paris, France (June 14‚Äì18, 2010) the results of their strategic alliance since October 2009, the models ATX6 (universal container carrier) and ATX8 (troop carrier) The vehicles appear to be based on Tatra T815-7 (T817) 6x6, 8x8 chassis, suspension and cabins while using Navistar engines and other components. Under the deal Navistar Defence and Tatra A.S. will market the vehicles in North America, which includes sales to the United States military and foreign military sales financed by the United States government. Tatra will source parts and components through Navistar's global parts and support network for Tatra trucks delivered in markets outside of North America, as well as market Navistar-Tatra vehicles around the world in their primary markets.  Former Ford Motor Company= 2007 Ford F-650, a product of Blue Diamond Truck From the 1980s to the 2010s, Navistar had a close relationship with Ford Motor Company. Commencing for the 1983 model year as an engine-supply agreement, the relationship evolved into a $400 million yearly business, also involving the production of entire vehicles. Following the end of the diesel- engine supply agreement after the 2010 model year, Ford and Navistar ended collaborative production of medium-duty commercial trucks after the 2014 model year. Ford PowerStroke diesel As a result of the gas crises of the 1970s, the implementation of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE), was applied to light trucks alongside automobiles. In response, large-block gasoline V8 engines (such as the Ford 460) were withdrawn from production from pickup trucks and full-size vans. For the 1983 model year, Ford entered into a supply agreement with International Harvester to use the newly introduced IDI diesel V8 for ¬æ and 1-ton F-Series pickups and E-Series vans. While roughly matching the output of the discontinued 400 cubic-inch V8 (the engine that it replaced alongside a reintroduced 460), the 6.9L diesel offered fuel economy closer to the standard 4.9L inline-6. While originally developed for the S1700 medium-duty truck, the engine supply agreement brought a diesel engine to market faster (and at far lower cost) than developing an engine from the ground up. In 1988, as International phased out the 6.9L engine, Ford received the 7.3L IDI diesel. During 1994 production, the IDI was replaced by the all- new T444E; to emphasize the introduction of direct injection fuel delivery, Ford began to brand International-sourced engines under the \\"PowerStroke\\" branding. As with the IDI, the T444E/PowerStroke was used in F-Series/E-Series trucks and vans. During 2003 production, the Ford Super Duty line and the E-Series adopted the VT365, replacing the T444E. For 2008, the MaxxForce 7 was introduced for the Super Duty pickups as a PowerStroke engine; in place of a variable-geometry turbocharger (used by International trucks), Ford versions of the engine were fitted with compound turbochargers. As the 6.4L engine would not properly fit in the vehicle, the E-Series continued use of the 6.0L diesel. After the 2010 model year, Ford ended the use of International- supplied diesel engines. From 2011 onward, the Super Duty was fitted with diesel engines developed by Ford; the E-Series shifted production exclusively to gasoline-based engines. Today, Ford continues the use of the PowerStroke branding, using it for multiple diesel engines produced by the company. Blue Diamond Truck 2006 Ford LCF (low-cab forward); built by Blue Diamond Truck (also International CF/CityStar) In September 2001, Navistar announced a joint venture with Ford, named Blue Diamond Truck Co. LLC. A 50/50 agreement between the two companies, Blue Diamond was intended to develop and manufacture vehicles and powertrains for both companies, using the International facility in General Escobedo, Mexico. In 2004, Blue Diamond Truck launched production. While sharing a common frame, the Ford F-650 and F-750 Super Duty were produced with different bodywork and powertrains than the International 4200/4300. In 2006, the two introduced the Ford LCF/International CF, the first model line of the combined company. To create a low-cab COE, the Blue Diamond (Ford/International) frame was combined with the Japanese-sourced cab of the Mazda Titan (converted to left-hand drive). The LCF received the first engine developed by Blue Diamond, a 4.5L V6 (a 6-cylinder version of the 6.0L V8). In 2015, the Blue Diamond Truck venture was dissolved by Ford. While International continued production at General Escobedo, as part of a redesign, Ford commercial truck production was shifted to Avon Lake, Ohio. =Anhui Jianghuai Navistar= On 16 September 2010, Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Co., Ltd. (JAC) announced joint ventures with NC2 Global and Navistar International Corporation that will develop, build, and market heavy duty trucks and diesel engines in China. In May 2018, it was announced that Cummins would be buying out Navistar's equity in the venture. =Mahindra Navistar= Navistar formed a joint venture with Mahindra & Mahindra to build heavy trucks in India under the \\"Mahindra International\\" brand, which has since been renamed Mahindra Navistar. These trucks were displayed at Auto Expo 2010 in Delhi, India. The joint venture ceased as Navistar exited the joint venture in 2013. Controversies In December 2011, the nonpartisan organization Public Campaign criticized Navistar International for spending $6.31 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008‚Äì2010, instead getting $18 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $896 million and increasing executive pay by 81%. On January 31, 2005, Navistar Financial said it would restate financial statements for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2004, because it did not take into consideration potential changes to future income. On April 7, 2006, Navistar restated financial results from 2002 through 2004, and for the first three quarters of 2005, due to accounting practices that are the subject of a continuing review. Accounting issues In January 2006, the company declared it would not file its form 10-K annual report with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on time. The delay was caused by the disagreement with its auditors, Deloitte & Touche, over complex accounting issues. In April, Navistar fired Deloitte, its independent auditor for 98 years, and hired KPMG to help restate earnings back to 2002 to fix accounting errors. On December 15, 2006, Navistar executives announced a further delay in its restatement and 2006 results. The announcement prompted the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to announce the delisting of the company, after 98 years of trading, although the NYSE subsequently delayed the delisting pending an appeal by Navistar. However, Navistar was removed from the S&P; 500 Index, and the NYSE eventually denied Navistar's appeal and delisted the stock; it traded on the Pink Sheets until 30 June 2008, when it was relisted on the NYSE, under its previous ticker symbol, NAV, after catching up with its filings. Christopher Anderson, the Deloitte partner responsible for the 2003 audit, accepted a one-year suspension from public audits in 2008, and became the first individual to be fined by the PCAOB.Deloitte Partner Disciplined Over Navistar Audit, CNN, October 31, 2008 CEO Daniel Ustian agreed to surrender to Navistar shares worth $1.3 million, while former Chief Financial Officer Robert C. Lannert consented to repay $1.05 million, each sum reflecting monetary bonuses they had received during the restatement period, the SEC said. Four other company executives paid civil penalties without admitting liability. In December 2014, Navistar disclosed more accounting problems. These involved out-of-period adjustments, which were corrections of prior period errors relating to product warranties. This resulted in a $36 million increase in Cost of Products Sold. In addition, a material weakness was disclosed. In the company's annual 10K, they reported that weakness was \\"surrounding validation of the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the determination of significant accounting estimates and accounting transactions. Specifically, controls were not designed to identify errors in the underlying data which was used to calculate warranty cost estimates and other significant accounting estimates and the accounting effects of significant transactions. Failed Engine Strategy In 2001, then CEO Dan Ustian faced numerous United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations to reduce the amount of nitrogen oxides and soot emanating from diesel engines. Despite the change in the compliance arena, the regulations would not begin to be phased in until 2007, with full implementation slated for 2010. Ustian had multiple engineering paths available. Among them were Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR), Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR), or the use of nitrogen oxide absorbers. All required more engineering and development to achieve compliance. Ustian believed truckers did not want to bother with an extra tank of fluid after treatment. As a result, he convinced the company to spend $700 million to fund EGR development. On October 31, 2007, Navistar formally announced their intent to move forward with EGR as the company's strategy. The company statement included Ustian mentioning ‚ÄúI have publicly been an advocate of customer friendly emissions control solutions which do not add additional costs to our truck and bus customers. While SCR is a means to achieve the NOx reduction requirement for 2010, it comes with a steep cost to our customers. Our ability to achieve our goals without adding customer cost and inconvenience is a competitive advantage for International.‚Äù On November 24, 2008, Navistar revealed it would use EPA Credits in order to comply with the 2010 legislation. In February 2009, Ustian touted the benefits of EGR technology as a key differentiator for the company's engines. However, by now, the rest of the industry had chosen to use compliant SCR technology. Ustian disagreed with SCR, saying \\"the other thing that EGR avoids is the risks of an SCR strategy. Read the label on this and it will show you that there are challenges with keeping control of using this technology: ‚ÄòStore between 23 degrees and 68 degrees.‚Äô So essentially it says you can't throw it outside.

To bridge the gap, Navistar began using EPA credits it had previously earned for being compliant in lieu of paying fines. In August 2012, Navistar stated they would run out of EPA credits soon. Only days earlier the EPA announced increased new penalties of $3,744 per engine. In March 2009, Navistar sued the EPA, claiming that the agency's guidance documents for SCR implementation were invalid because they were adopted without a public process and with input only from the SCR engine makers. Navistar and the EPA settled the lawsuit a year later. Further masking the EGR problem were high military sales. In the company's 2010 10K report, Navistar cited orders for MRAPs as offsetting flat commercial sales due to the recession. In January 2012, the EPA adopted an interim final rule that allowed Navistar to continue selling the engines subject to NCPs. Several Navistar competitors sued, and in June 2012 the same appeals court ruled that EPA's interim rule was invalid because it did not give the public notice and an opportunity for comment. In the meantime, Navistar's EGR decision had led to significant reliability and quality problems. Truck drivers began losing trust and confidence as Navistar vehicles were breaking down frequently. Consequently, they abandoned Navistar trucks in favor of competitor's trucks. =Legal issues (MaxxForce engines)= In December 2014, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ordered that 13 of 14 civil lawsuits brought against Navistar for MaxxForce engines would be consolidated into one case. The consolidated lawsuits say Navistar's use of Advanced Exhaust Gas Recirculation emission control system, or EGR, was defective and resulted in repeated engine failures and frequent repairs and downtime. On December 16, 2014, Navistar reported a larger than expected 4th quarter net loss of $72 million. While sales rose 9 percent to $3 billion, the company cited restructuring and warranty costs as the main reasons for the loss. A day earlier, the company announced it would be closing its engine foundry in Indianapolis, resulting in the loss of 100 jobs and costing $11 million. The company estimated annual savings of $13 million in operating costs. In March 2015, Navistar reported a first-quarter 2015 net loss of $42 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, compared to a first-quarter 2014 net loss of $248 million, or $3.05 per diluted share. Revenues in the quarter were $2.4 billion, up to $213 million or 10 percent, versus the first quarter of 2014. The higher revenues in the quarter were driven by a 17 percent year-over-year increase in charge outs for Class 6-8 trucks and buses in the United States and Canada. This included a 42 percent increase in school buses; a 25 percent increase in Class 6/7 medium trucks; a 7 percent increase in Class 8 heavy trucks; and a 5 percent increase in Class 8 severe service trucks. Higher sales in the company's export truck operations also contributed to the increase, partially offset by a decrease in used truck sales. The company finished the first quarter with a 27 percent year-over-year increase in order backlog for Class 6-8 trucks. On June 4, 2015, Navistar reported a second-quarter net loss of $64 million, or 78 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $297 million, or $3.65 a share. Revenue fell to $2.69 billion from $2.75 billion. Analysts had expected a loss of 18 cents a share and revenue of $2.82 billion. On June 9, 2015, Navistar named Jeff Sass as the new Senior VP of North American Truck Sales. Sass previously worked 20 years for rival Paccar. On June 12, 2015, Mark Rachesky's MHR Fund Management LLC disclosed a 6% increased stake in Navistar, up to 15,446,562 shares. The firm now owns 18.9% of Navistar. In July 2015, the EPA filed a civil lawsuit against Navistar seeking $300 million in fines over its use of non-compliant engines in its 2010-model trucks ‚Äì engines that did not meet the agency's exhaust emission standards. ‚ÄúBecause (Navistar) completed manufacturing and assembling processes for the subject engines in 2010 ‚Ä¶ each and every engine was ‚Äòproduced‚Äô in 2010 and is therefore not a model 2009 engine,‚Äù the complaint said. Navistar classified the engines as 2009 model year engines because it began assembling them in 2009. Navistar has stated they dispute the allegations and would \\"aggressively defend\\" their position. On July 20, 2015, Navistar announced that it was refinancing the $697.5 million senior secured term loan facility of Navistar, Inc., which matures in August 2017, with a new $1.040 billion senior secured term loan, which will mature in August 2020. The refinancing will extend the maturity of the term loan facility and provide additional liquidity and financial flexibility for the company. In March 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Navistar with misleading investors about its development of the advanced technology truck engine. In August 2017, a Tennessee jury found that Navistar committed fraud and violated the Tennessee Consumer Practice Act in connection with the sale of 243 Navistar International ProStars with MaxxForce engines to Milan Supply Chain Solutions. It awarded $10.8 million in actual damages and $20 million in punitive damages. The trial included testimony from Jim Hebe, who previously was the senior vice president, North America Sales Operations. Hebe retired in October 2012. Hebe's testimony about the engine program mentioned that the company \\"did not test shit\\". In a statement, Navistar said it is disappointed in the jury's verdict and is evaluating its options to challenge it, noting it has successfully defended similar claims in several jurisdictions, including dismissal of claims of fraud in courts in Texas, Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, Alabama, and Illinois.

The gang starts to have doubts about Angel's loyalties when he appears to have become very close with the Circle of the Black Thorn, an evil secret demon society. When Drogyn, the guardian of the Deeper Well, arrives from England claiming that Angel has sent assassins after him, the gang's fears that Angel has become corrupted by wealth and power seem to be validated, especially when the imprisoned Lindsey confirms his theory about the Circle of the Black Thorn wanting to have Angel join their evil group. In the meanwhile, Angel continues dating Nina, but eventually tells her to leave town fearing for her life when his induction into the Black Thorn becomes a certainty. At the end, when the gang confronts Angel in his office about his questionable actions, a fight breaks out. With Lorne as a shield, Angel has time to take out a magical gem, using it to grant them a few unobserved minutes to set the group straight about what he is really planning, without anyone else knowing. It turns out that Angel has set up this whole charade of turning evil in an effort to infiltrate the Circle of the Black Thorn and identify its members. Plot In a dark room, there is a shackled man with a bag over his head, who is being beaten with sticks by several attackers. Angel helps the man to his feet, and takes the bag off the man's face. The man thanks Angel but then Angel vamps out and bites the man's neck. Nineteen hours earlier, Angel and Nina are lying in bed together and Nina notices that Angel is concerned with something at work. Back at Wolfram & Hart, Illyria complains that no one fears her anymore and Wesley is ignoring her ever since she pretended to be Fred. Spike tells her that although she has lost much of her powers, looking like Fred is more powerful than anything else to those who loved her. Meanwhile, Hamilton introduces Angel and Gunn to Senator Brucker and her vampire aide, Ernesto. Ernesto asks for human blood and Angel agrees to make an exception, upsetting Gunn. Wesley informs Angel that a Boretz demon is loose and killing people. However, Angel shrugs it off and leaves. Spike offers to take on the demon for Wesley and invites Illyria to go hunting with him. In Angel's office, Angel, Gunn, Ernesto, and the Senator are watching a political ad of her rival, Mike Conley. The Senator asks Wolfram & Hart to brainwash Conley into confessing to being a pedophile so he will lose. Gunn is furious at the Senator's request, but Angel agrees. In Wesley's office, Wesley is researching Boretz demons when a strange circular symbol with eight spurs appears in his book but then disappears. Meanwhile, Spike and Illyria are searching for the Boretz demon. Illyria tells Spike that Angel has become corrupted through power but he refuses to believe her. The Boretz appears, and fights Spike but Illyria ultimately kill it. Drogyn also appears and warns Spike that Angel cannot be trusted, but falls over, injured. Back at Wolfram & Hart, Wesley walks into Angel's office where he finds Angel talking with Hamilton, and they ask Wesley to come back later. Gunn, Lorne, and Wesley all agree that Angel is not acting like himself at all. Spike calls, and the three gather in Spike's apartment to listen to Drogyn's tale of being attacked by a Sathari demon, an assassin-for- hire, at the Deeper Well. After a long and vicious fight, Drogyn learned that Angel hired it to kill him. Drogyn thinks that Angel wanted to cover up his involvement in helping Illyria's sarcophagus escape from the Deeper Well. Drogyn also believes that Angel sacrificed Fred on purpose. Lorne and Gunn take the news angrily, but Spike reminds them that Drogyn cannot lie. Wesley shows all of them the mysterious symbol of a black circle with eight spurs on it and believes it to be a connection to Angel's behavior. Gunn, Lorne, Spike, and Wesley leave to confront Angel, while Illyria keeps watch over Drogyn. At the office, Spike interrogates Angel about Drogyn's attack but Angel denies everything. Angel explains that he's lost his sense of morality, and he wants global power, through any means necessary. He then meets with Nina and gives her three plane tickets, urging her to leave him. Hurt and confused, Nina agrees. At Spike's apartment, Hamilton breaks in the door and knocks out Drogyn and Illyria. Meanwhile, Gunn and Spike interrogate Lindsey about the symbol. He explains that the symbol represents a small, but powerful, secret society of the elite evil, called the Circle of the Black Thorn who are responsible for the Apocalypse. Lindsey explains that Wolfram & Hart is run by the Black Thorn while The Senior Partners actually live on a different plane of existence. Angel's team realize that Angel is being corrupted by the Circle of the Black Thorn. Back in the dark room from the beginning, Angel takes the bag off the man's face to reveal it is Drogyn. Angel drinks his blood and is then branded with the symbol for the Circle of the Black Thorn. The robed attackers reveal themselves and celebrate Angel's acceptance into the fold. The next day at Wolfram & Hart, Angel is attacked by Gunn, Lorne, Spike, and Wesley. Angel disarms everybody and pulls a crystal out of his jacket, which activates a glamour that conceals the room for six minutes. Angel reveals that he has everything that he has been doing‚Äîagreeing with their evil clients, sending Wesley the symbol, hiring the assassin to kill Drogyn‚Äîis to convince the Black Thorn that he is evil so he can infiltrate them. Angel explains further that two months earlier, Cordelia gave Angel a vision from their kiss about the Black Thorn and the apocalypse. Finally, Angel reveals that he will kill all the members of the Black Thorn to stop the Apocalypse. Spike grimly points out that the Senior Partners will kill them all in retaliation and refers to Angel's plan as a suicidal, \\"burn the house down, while we're still in it\\" strategy. However, the team eventually agrees to go along with Angel's plan. The episode ends with Hamilton ominously watching them from the window outside the office, suspicious but unable to prove anything. Writing The writing staff had originally hoped Sarah Michelle Gellar would return as Buffy for this episode, but Gellar was busy shooting \\"The Grudge\\" at the time.

It is the only high school operated by Chester County School District and is fed by Chester County Junior High School. History In 1909 Chester County High School (for whites only) was established in the Georgie Robertson Christian College building (later known as the Milan-Sitka Building on the campus of Freed-Hardeman University). The number of high school students in 1913 was 50; this increased to 101 students by 1914. The school for 1915‚Äì16 was divided into grammar school, junior high, and high school. The curriculum during these first years included English, math, home economics, geography, general science, biology, physics, chemistry, agriculture and history. Sixteen units were required for graduation, beginning in 1916. When public transport improved in the 1930s, the enrollment in the school began to expand. An annex was added to the original building and several residential houses were bought for the overflow. Despite more than 1,000 students attending the small school, it continued to be in the same building until 1951. The second building for Chester County High School was the finest one in West Tennessee at that time and cost $500,000. The gymnasium was the largest in the area and became the site for many regional basketball tournaments. When the East Chester Elementary School was completed in 1962 the Georgie Robertson Christian College building became vacant. It was sold to Freed-Hardeman University and became known as the Milan-Sitka Building, although it was finally demolished in 2004. The profits from this sale were used to build an auditorium at the high school in the early 1970s. In 1968, as the result of desegregation, CCHS was merged with Chester County Training School, the former high school for African American students.l In 1997, Chester County High School moved to its third new building, situated next to the second one, which is now serving as Chester County Middle School (4th-5th grades).

An analog of its neuraminic acid substrate, used as an inhibitor drug, is the small white and red molecule in the center. N-Acetylneuraminic acid Neuraminidase (Sialidase) enzymes are glycoside hydrolase enzymes that cleave (cut) the glycosidic linkages of neuraminic acids. Neuraminidase enzymes are a large family, found in a range of organisms. The best-known neuraminidase is the viral neuraminidase, a drug target for the prevention of the spread of influenza infection. The viral neuraminidases are frequently used as antigenic determinants found on the surface of the influenza virus. Some variants of the influenza neuraminidase confer more virulence to the virus than others. Other homologues are found in mammalian cells, which have a range of functions. At least four mammalian sialidase homologues have been described in the human genome (see NEU1, NEU2, NEU3, NEU4). Sialidases may act as pathogenic factors in microbial infections.  Reaction  There are two major classes of Neuraminidase that cleave exo or endo poly-sialic acids: * Exo hydrolysis of Œ±-(2‚Üí3)-, Œ±-(2‚Üí6)-, Œ±-(2‚Üí8)-glycosidic linkages of terminal sialic acid residues * Endo hydrolysis of (2‚Üí8)-Œ±-sialosyl linkages in oligo- or poly(sialic) acids  Function  Neuraminidases, also called sialidases, catalyze the hydrolysis of terminal sialic acid residues from the newly formed virions and from the host cell receptors. Sialidase activities include assistance in the mobility of virus particles through the respiratory tract mucus and in the elution of virion progeny from the infected cell.  Subtypes  Swiss-Prot lists 137 types of neuraminidase from various species as of October 18, 2006.Search in UniProt Knowledgebase (Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL) for: neuraminidase Nine subtypes of influenza neuraminidase are known; many occur only in various species of duck and chicken. Subtypes N1 and N2 have been positively linked to epidemics in man, and strains with N3 or N7 subtypes have been identified in a number of isolated deaths. CAZy defines a total of 85 glycosyl hydrolase families, of which families GH34 (viral), GH33 (cellular organisms), GH58 (viral and bacterial), GH83 (viral) are major families that contain this enzyme. GH58 is the only endo-acting family. The following is a list of major classes of neuraminidase enzymes: * Viral neuraminidase * Bacterial neuraminidase * Mammalian neuraminidases: { -valign=top }  Structure  Influenza neuraminidase is a mushroom-shaped projection on the surface of the influenza virus. It has a head consisting of four co-planar and roughly spherical subunits, and a hydrophobic region that is embedded within the interior of the virus' membrane. It comprises a single polypeptide chain that is oriented in the opposite direction to the hemagglutinin antigen. The composition of the polypeptide is a single chain of six conserved polar amino acids, followed by hydrophilic, variable amino acids. Œ≤-Sheets predominate as the secondary level of protein conformation. The structure of trans-sialidase includes a catalytic beta-propeller domain, a N-terminal lectin-like domain and an irregular beta- stranded domain inserted into the catalytic domain. Recent emergence of oseltamivir and zanamivir resistant human influenza A(H1N1) H274Y has emphasized the need for suitable expression systems to obtain large quantities of highly pure and stable, recombinant neuraminidase through two separate artificial tetramerization domains that facilitate the formation of catalytically active neuraminidase homotetramers from yeast and Staphylothermus marinus, which allow for secretion of FLAG-tagged proteins and further purification.  Mechanism  The enzymatic mechanism of influenza virus sialidase has been studied by Taylor et al., shown in Figure 1. The enzyme catalysis process has four steps. The first step involves the distortion of the Œ±-sialoside from a 2C5 chair conformation (the lowest-energy form in solution) to a pseudoboat conformation when the sialoside binds to the sialidase. The second step leads to an oxocarbocation intermediate, the sialosyl cation. The third step is the formation of Neu5Ac initially as the Œ±-anomer, and then mutarotation and release as the more thermodynamically- stable Œ≤-Neu5Ac.  Inhibitors  Neuraminidase inhibitors are useful for combating influenza infection: zanamivir, administered by inhalation; oseltamivir, administered orally; peramivir administered parenterally, that is through intravenous or intramuscular injection; and laninamivir which is in phase III clinical trials. There are two major proteins on the surface of influenza virus particles. One is the lectin haemagglutinin protein with three relatively shallow sialic acid-binding sites and the other is enzyme sialidase with the active site in a pocket. Because of the relative deep active site in which low-molecular-weight inhibitors can make multiple favorable interactions and approachable methods of designing transition-state analogues in the hydrolysis of sialosides, the sialidase becomes more attractive anti-influenza drug target than the haemagglutinin. After the X-ray crystal structures of several influenza virus sialidases were available, the structure-based inhibitor design was applied to discover potent inhibitors of this enzyme. The unsaturated sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid [Neu5ac]) derivative 2-deoxy-2, 3-didehydro-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac2en), a sialosyl cation transition-state (Figure 2) analogue, is believed the most potent inhibitor core template. Structurally modified Neu5Ac2en derivatives may give more effective inhibitors. Many Neu5Ac2en-based compounds have been synthesized and tested for their influenza virus sialidase inhibitory potential. For example: The 4-substituted Neu5Ac2en derivatives (Figure 3), 4-amino-Neu5Ac2en (Compound 1), which showed two orders of magnitude better inhibition of influenza virus sialidase than Neu5Ac2en5 and 4-guanidino- Neu5Ac2en (Compound 2), known as Zanamivir, which is now marketed for treatment of influenza virus as a drug, have been designed by von Itzstein and coworkers. A series of amide-linked C9 modified Neu5Ac2en have been reported by Megesh and colleagues as NEU1 inhibitors.

The film was directed by Tommy O'Haver for Miramax Films and written by R. Lee Fleming Jr.. The film was released on March 9, 2001, and stars Ben Foster, Kirsten Dunst, Melissa Sagemiller, Sisq√≥, Shane West, Colin Hanks, Zoe Saldana, Mila Kunis, Swoosie Kurtz, Ed Begley Jr., Carmen Electra and Martin Short. The film grossed $19 million against a budget of $22 million.  Plot  Berke Landers and his girlfriend, Allison, were the quintessential high- school couple who grew up together and eventually fell in love, but she breaks up with him immediately after the film begins. This leads to an opening musical number of \\"Love Will Keep Us Together\\" sung by Vitamin C, imagined by Berke. He seeks advice from his embarrassing parents Frank and Beverly Landers, who are hosts of a relationship advice show called Love Matters, but they don't help with the situation by instead focusing on his sex life. Allison then starts a relationship with Striker, a \\"foreign\\" student who was once the lead singer of a boy band called the Swingtown Lads. When Allison and Striker audition for the school's upcoming musical, Berke desperately tries to win Allison back by also auditioning for the play, despite having no theatrical talent and having a busy schedule as a member of the basketball team. Meanwhile, Berke's friends Felix and Dennis try to find a new girlfriend for him. With the help of Felix's younger sister, Kelly, a talented songwriter and singer, Berke wins a minor role in the play, a modern musical version of Shakespeare's comedy A Midsummer Night's Dream called A Midsummer Night's Rockin' Eve, written and directed by the school's domineering drama teacher, Dr. Desmond Oates (Martin Short). Striker plays Demetrius, Allison plays Hermia, Kelly plays Helena, and Lysander is to be played by the school's star actor, Peter Wong. But after Peter is injured in a freak accident, Striker nominates Berke to take over the role of Lysander, and, still intent on winning Allison back, Berke accepts. He gradually improves with continuing assistance from Kelly, but remains unaware of the growing attraction between the two of them. While searching through props backstage, Kelly accidentally shoots Berke in the arm with an arrow gun, thinking it's a prop. Meanwhile, Oates blames Kelly's singing for his own poorly written song and rejects her suggestions to improve it. Felix and Dennis set Berke up on a date with Dora, a very attractive but accident-prone woman. The date ends horribly when Dora inadvertently causes a fire in the restaurant. Later, the boys try again to get Berke's mind off things by taking him to an underground sex club. However, their attempts fail when Berke is locked into a harness and whipped by a dominatrix. The night ends with Felix and Dennis abandoning Berke after the police raid the club, who is then picked up by his parents. Much to Berke's chagrin, his parents congratulate him on his seemingly kinky sexual tastes. At a party thrown by Felix at Berke's house, Kelly kisses Berke, but he insists that a relationship between them could not work because she is Felix's sister. She leaves him, annoyed at his unwillingness to move on with his life, and Felix, coming across the two, punches Berke. At the same party, Berke and Allison catch Striker cheating on Allison with her best friend Maggie, and so Allison breaks up with Striker. Meanwhile, Frank and Beverly return home to find the party and once again congratulate Berke. Berke lambastes them for constantly embarrassing him and not acting like normal parents would in these types of situations. On the play's opening night, the first half of the performance goes smoothly except for some onstage scuffling between Berke and Striker. During the intermission, Allison confides to Berke that she wants to get back together with him, leaving him with a difficult choice between her and Kelly. Meanwhile, Striker bribes two of the theater technicians to try and blow Berke off the stage using stage pyrotechnics. Before the play resumes, Felix gives the orchestra sheet music for a love ballad written by Kelly to replace Oates' unpopular tune. After the curtain rises, Kelly sings her song so beautifully that Berke is reminded of their time together and finally realizes he loves her. As the fourth act begins, he abandons his lines from the script and makes up his own verse professing his character's love for Kelly's character Helena. The audience applauds as Berke and Kelly kiss. Striker protests this change, but unwittingly signals the technicians to set off the explosion, blowing him offstage and into the orchestral section, sending Dora flying into the air. Felix catches her and they become a couple. Dennis kisses Kelly's friend and his dancing partner Basin, who kisses him back, suggesting that they also begin a relationship. Kelly and Berke leave the theater after the show, looking forward to their future together as they discuss the next night's performance. The film ends with Sisq√≥ and Vitamin C singing and dancing along with the cast to the song \\"September\\" as the credits roll.  Cast  Production  Get Over It was filmed in Ontario, Canada.

It is notable as the first collection devoted exclusively to biographies of women in Western literature. At the same time as he was writing On Famous Women, Boccaccio also compiled a collection of biographies of famous men, De Casibus Virorum Illustrium (On the Fates of Famous Men). Purpose Penthesilea, illustration from a 15th-century De Mulieribus Claris in conservation at the Biblioth√®que nationale de France in Paris. BnF Fran√ßais 599, fol.27v Boccaccio claimed to have written the 106 biographies for the posterity of the women who were considered renowned, whether good or bad. He believed that recounting the deeds of certain women who may have been wicked would be offset by the exhortations to virtue by the deeds of good women. He writes in his presentation of this combination of all types of women that he hoped it would encourage virtue and curb vice. Overview The author declares in the preface that this collection of 106 short biographies (104 chapters). Biographies 11‚Äì12 and 19‚Äì20 are combined to make 104 chapters, however the biographies are I (1) through CVI (106). of women is the first example in Western literature devoted solely and exclusively to women. Some of the lost works of Suetonius' \\"illustrious people\\" and Boccaccio's De Casibus Virorum Illustrium are a mixture of women and men, where others like Petrarch's De Viris Illustribus and Jerome's De Viris Illustribus are biographies of exclusively men. Boccaccio himself even says this work was inspired and modeled on Petrarch's De Viris Illustribus. Development Opis, wife of Saturn. BnF Fran√ßais 599, fol.7 Harmonia of Syracuse and her body double from the c.1473 Ulm version Inc B-720, fol.93 Boccaccio wrote this work in Certaldo probably between the summer of 1361 and the summer of 1362, although it could have been as late as December 1362. He dedicated his work to Andrea Acciaioli, Countess of Altavilla, in Naples at the end of 1362 even though he continued to revise it up until his death in 1375. She was not his first choice however. He first considered to dedicate his slim volume to Joanna I of Naples. He ultimately decided that his work as a little book was not worthy a person of such great fame. There are over 100 surviving manuscripts which shows that the De Mulieribus Claris was \\"among the most popular works in the last age of the manuscript book\\". Boccaccio worked on this as a labor of love with several versions, editions, and rearrangements in the last twenty years or so of his life: studies have identified at least nine stages in its composition. In the last part of the 14th century after Boccaccio died a Donato degli Albanzani had a copy that his friend Boccaccio gave him and translated it from Latin into Italian. Content Isis of Egypt The 106 Famous Women biographies are of mythological and historical women, as well as some of Boccaccio's Renaissance contemporaries. The brief life stories follow the same general exemplary literature patterns used in various versions of De viris illustribus. The biography pattern starts with the name of the person, then the parents or ancestors, then their rank or social position, and last the general reason for their notoriety or fame with associated details. This is sometimes interjected with a philosophical or inspirational lesson at the end. The only sources that Boccaccio specifically says he used are Saint Paul (no. 42), the Bible (no. 43) and Jerome (no. 86). The wording of the biographies themselves, however, provide hints about where he obtained his information. He clearly had access to works of the classical authors Valerius Maximus, Pliny, Livy, Ovid, Suetonius, Statius, Virgil, Lactantius, Orosius, and Justinus.  Influence  Boccaccio's collection of female biographies inspired characters in Christine de Pizan's The Book of the City of Ladies (1405) In the early part of the 15th century Antonio di S. Lupidio made a volgare translation and Laurent de Premierfait published it in French as Des cleres et nobles femmes. Boccaccio's biographies also inspired Alvaro de Luna's De las virtuosas y claras mujeres, Thomas Elyot's Defence of Good Women, Alonso of Cartagena's De las mujeres ilustres, Giovanni Sabbadino degli Arienti's Gynevera de la clare donne, Iacopo Filippo Forest's De plurimis claris selectisque mulierbus and Jean Lemaire's Couronne margaritique. In England, and various works by Edmund Spenser used Boccaccio's De Mulieribus Claris as inspiration and the famous women influenced Geoffrey Chaucer's Legend of Good Women and The Canterbury Tales(1387-1400). In the beginning of the 16th century a Henry Parker translated about half into English and dedicated it to Henry VIII. In the 16th century of new Italian translations by Luca Antonio Ridolfi and Giuseppe Betussi were published. In Germany De Mulieribus Claris was widely distributed as manuscript. The first printed book of the Latin language original was produced in the workshop of Johann Zainer and was published decorated with woodcut miniatures in 1473. This 1473 edition was the first Latin version print. The only complete 16th century printed Latin version to survive is from a Mathias Apiarus done around 1539. The German translation by Heinrich Steinh√∂wel was printed and published also by Zainer in 1474. The book became so popular that in the subsequent hundred years the Steinh√∂wel translation was republished in six editions. Steinh√∂wel had added geographic relevance, by placing the Amazons in Swabia.

Licton Springs  Licton Springs, the natural iron spring Licton Springs is both a residential neighborhood and a natural spring at the north end of Licton Springs Park, which has a long history as both a unique recreational spot and a commercial crossroads. The neighborhood, wedged between the busy corridors of Interstate 5 and Aurora Avenue, takes its name from l√≠q‚Äôt”ôd (LEEK-teed) or Licton, the Lushootseed (Whulshootseed) Coast Salish word for the reddish mud of the springs--. The D _kh_ w‚ÄôDuw‚ÄôAbsh, People of the Inside and Xacuab≈°, People of the Large Lake, Lushootseed (Skagit-Nisqually) Coast Salish native people had used the springs area as a spiritual health spa since the area was populated after the last glacial period (c. 8,000 BCE--10,000 years ago). In the 1850s, the D _kh_ w‚ÄôDuw‚ÄôAbsh and Xacuab≈° became the Duwamish tribe of today. In October 2019, the spring and the park that surrounds it were designated a city landmark, the first Native cultural site to be so designated.  Settlement  Seattle pioneer David Denny built a summer cabin near the springs around 1870. The natural spring fed Green Lake before it was capped and drained to the Metro sewer system after it became contaminated by residential development (1920, 1931). The Olmsted Brothers designed a park for Licton Springs, as part of a grand streets and parks plan for Seattle (1930s), but this park was never implemented. A park does exist today (where Woodlawn Avenue curves to connect with N 95th Street) in which the spring is located.Licton Springs Park Licton Springs Park Homepage In the mid-1960s restoration began with bond issues and increasing volunteer assistance, resulting in a small pond and natural wetland vegetation as well as urban park amenities.Sheridan & Tobin, Wilma, ed.

In the early years, the line ran through cut forest and rural farms. A few sawmills along the way gave the line a business hauling lumber.

The film was made by Gary Kildea, under the direction of anthropologist Jerry Leach. It was shot in three weeks, on a budget of around Au$180,000.  Historical context and film summary  Cricket was introduced to Trobriand by a British missionary, Reverend Gilmour, in the early 20th century, to replace violent tribal warfare with gentlemanly sportsmanship. Cricket in Trobriand underwent a dramatic transformation: the number of players, balls, bats, rules, and uniforms changed, as did the meaning of the sport and manner of play. In the film, cricket in Trobriand appears to be a form of ritualized warfare. The film contrasts scenes of the original, staid game played on pitches in England with the Trobriand version, full of colors, sounds, music, and dance. A Trobriand \\"reporter\\" also seeks to find the meaning and origin of his 'own' culture, by interviewing senior members of the community and by observing the cricket game/ritual. In fact, this film was done of a reconstruction of cricket match \\"specifically enacted for the camera team by the members of a local political movement, who at the time of filming (1973) were seeking an ascendant role in the Trobriand politics.\\" Weiner also claims that this Kabisawali Association movement, led by John Kasaipwalova (or John K, as Kiriwina people called him) caused \\"intense sociopolitical factionalism that generated hatred, violence and confusion\\" and that John K was convicted by the Papua New Guinea government for embezzlement of government funds. Weiner also notes that during that period and after, cricket was not being played in Kiriwina. Thus the Trobriand cricket in this film was a well orchestrated and heavily edited version of something of which Trobrianders had recent memory.  Anthropological significance  Notwithstanding criticism of the re-enactment and surrounding politics, the film was praised for its anthropological contribution. Trobriand Cricket is historically significant because it served in part as a model for future filmmakers seeking to take on an ethnographic project.Ness, Sally Ann. \\"Understanding Cultural Performance: \\"Trobriand Cricket\\"\\" TDR 32.4 (1988): 135-47.

It is found in open lowland and wooded areas with moist soils along the Pacific coast from southwestern British Columbia to northwestern California. This animal's total range in Canada is estimated to be 20 km¬≤ (). Townsend's mole is classified as Least Concern by the IUCN; however, in Canada it is considered an endangered species. This animal has velvety black fur, a pointed snout and a short, thick, a tail with barely any hair. It is about in length including a tail, and weighs about . Its front paws are broad and spade-shaped, specialized for digging; the rear paws are smaller. It has 44 teeth. Its ears are not visible and it has small eyes. It is similar in appearance to the smaller coast mole. This mole spends most of its time underground, foraging in shallow burrows for earthworms, small invertebrates and plant material. It is active year-round. This animal is mainly solitary except during mating in late winter. The female has a litter of two to four young in a deep burrow. This animal was named after the American naturalist John Kirk Townsend. The name was selected at the request of Thomas Nuttall as a patronym to honor Townsend's contribution.

The album charted at number 4 in the UK and number 66 in the US, but received a mixed response from critics. The singles lifted from the album were \\"Dagenham Dave\\" (which reached number 26 in the UK Singles Chart in August 1995) and \\"The Boy Racer\\" (which reached number 36 in December).  Content  The nature of the album is different from past Morrissey releases, such as the inclusion of two tracks which surpass the ten- minute mark, the near two-and-a-half-minute drum solo courtesy of Spencer Cobrin which opens the track \\"The Operation\\" and the sampling of a Shostakovich1 symphony. AllMusic described it as Morrissey's \\"art rock album, complete with strings, drum solos and two ten-minute songs.\\"  Musical style  Spin magazine described the album's musical style as \\"[differing] from the crushed flowers studio formalisations of last year's Vauxhall and I, building instead on the earlier Your Arsenal, Morrissey's sly, unexpected blending of rockabilly and glam.\\" And recorded in the mid-1990s, it's an album clearly influenced by Grunge Music.  Release  Southpaw Grammar was released on 28 August 1995 by record labels RCA in the UK and Reprise in the US. On its release Southpaw Grammar was an eyebrow-raiser for fans and critics alike. On 27 April 2009 Sony BMG released a remastered version of Southpaw Grammar in the UK. This version included a substantially altered running order, three previously unreleased tracks, \\"Honey, You Know Where to Find Me\\", \\"You Should Have Been Nice to Me\\" and \\"Fantastic Bird\\" (the last of which dates from the Your Arsenal sessions) as well as a single B-side \\"Nobody Loves Us\\". The digital version from iTunes Store adds live versions of \\"London\\" and \\"Billy Budd\\", recorded in London.  Reception  The critical reception to Southpaw Grammar was mixed. Richard Cromelin of the Los Angeles Times described it as \\"the most musically dynamic album from the Messiah of Moans since he revitalized British rock with The Smiths in the mid-'80s\\". Al Weisel of Rolling Stone qualified it as Morrissey's \\"most powerful solo outing to date\\". Qs Phil Sutcliffe wrote that Southpaw Grammar \\"shapes up as the kind of severe work that accrues more honour than love, more favourable comments than sales to record-buyers\\", and the magazine later listed it as one of the top 50 albums of 1995. In 1999, critic Ned Raggett ranked the album at number 79 on his list of \\"The Top 136 or So Albums of the Nineties\\". According to Uncut magazine: \\"On its release, Southpaw Grammar seemed to be the point where the Great British Public officially fell out of love with Morrissey. The casual Smiths fan had all but lost interest while even the scary Moz obsessives were a little puzzled.\\" Blenders Tony Power called it an \\"ugly, noisy, grumpy album, recorded while Britpop stole Moz's thunder and the Mike Joyce court case loomed.\\" Andrzej Lukowski of Drowned in Sound was more favourable in his retrospective assessment, writing that the album \\"is in some ways the most daring thing the ex-Smith has ever put his name to... [...] At the same time it's also pretty craven, in that it dilutes the impact of its three key tracks ‚Äì 'The Teachers Are Afraid of the Pupils', 'The Operation' and 'Southpaw', dark, sprawling semi-instrumentals dominated by the remarkable drumming of Spencer James Cobrin ‚Äì with lightweight fluff like 'Dagenham Dave' and 'The Boy Racer'.\\" Brad Shoup of Stereogum named it Morrissey's \\"peak\\" and \\"quintessential document\\".

As the first installment in the Rayman series, the game follows the adventures of Rayman, a hero who must save his colourful world from the evil Mr. Dark. Originally designed for the Atari Jaguar in 1995, a PlayStation version was developed and released in time for the North American launch of the console on 9 September 1995; and further ports were created for Sega Saturn in 1995 and MS-DOS computers in 1996. The game has appeared in various other formats, including versions for the Game Boy Advance, PlayStation Network, DSiWare, and iOS and Android devices. The mobile versions of Rayman were removed from digital stores in July 2018. On October 29, 2018, Sony revealed that the game would be one of 20 games pre-loaded on the PlayStation Classic, which was released on December 3, 2018.  Gameplay  An example of gameplay in Rayman. Band Land is the second of six worlds in the game. Rayman is a side-scrolling platform game. The player character is the titular Rayman, who must travel through six worlds (The Dream Forest, Band Land, Blue Mountains, Picture City, The Caves of Skops and Candy Ch√¢teau) to free all of the caged Electoons, six cages of whom are located somewhere on each level. Only when all the Electoons are freed will Rayman be able to reach and confront Mr Dark at his lair in Candy Ch√¢teau. Each level is divided into several maps, each of which is completed when Rayman reaches the \\"!\\" sign at the end. The player is given a certain number of lives, which are lost when Rayman takes too many hits or falls into water or a pit. If all lives are lost at any point, the \\"Game Over\\" screen will appear, and the player can continue or quit. Scattered around each level are small, sparkling blue spheres called Tings. If the player controlling Rayman picks up 100 (50 in the DSi version), he gains an extra life and the counter resets to zero. When the player loses a life, he loses any Tings he has collected. Tings can also be used to pay the Magician, a character found in certain levels, to enter a bonus stage, where Rayman can win an extra life. Rayman's \\"telescopic fist\\", an ability gained early in the game, allows him to punch enemies from a distance; most enemies can be defeated with a certain number of punches. At the end of each world, Rayman must defeat a boss enemy. The player comes across a variety of other power-ups and bonuses, such as a golden fist (which increases punch strength), a speed fist (which increases the speed of Rayman's punches), a power to restore Rayman's lost life energy, and flying blue elves whose touch shrinks Rayman down in size to access new areas. In early stages of the game, Rayman has the ability to walk, crawl and make silly faces. He obtains additional powers during the game (telescopic punching, holding onto ledges, grappling flying rings, using his hair as helicopter blades to glide, and running) from Betilla the Fairy, while others are given temporarily from his friends that are used for a specific levels only.  Plot  The Great Protoon maintains peace and balance throughout a valley that is Rayman's world. One day, the evil Mr. Dark steals the Great Protoon, leaving the Electoons, small beings who gravitate around it, vulnerable to Mr. Dark's forces, who have captured the Electoons in cages. Rayman must free the Electoons and recover the Great Protoon to restore the valley's balance. Betilla the Fairy, a guardian of the Great Protoon, frequently interacts with Rayman as needed to give him additional magical powers along his journey. Rayman begins his journey in the Dream Forest, one of the six lands of the valley. He begins with the ability to telescopically punch enemies until Betilla gives him the ability to hang onto ledges. He encounters a kindly local named Tarayzan, who hands over an instantly-sprouting magic seed to help him escape a rising flood. At the end of the Dream Forest, Rayman defeats the first of the game's six bosses, the giant Moskito. Betilla then gives Rayman the power to swing from flying hoops. Rayman arrives in Band Land, a world built around clouds and musical notes, symbols, and instruments. He is chased by Mr. Sax, a giant angry saxophone. Betilla grants Rayman the power to spin his hair like a helicopter for gliding. After defeating Mr. Sax, Rayman progresses through the Blue Mountains, a world of avalanches and rock monsters. He meets the family of musician friend and helps him build a new guitar in exchange for a potion that lets Rayman fly continually using his helicopter hair. Rayman defeats Mr. Stone, and Betilla gives him the ability to run. Picture City, the fourth land, is a world of paintings and art utensils, including slippery ink floors and deadly sharp pencils. Rayman makes his way through to arrive on the stage of a pirate-themed play, where a vicious actress in a Viking costume emerges from the ship's cannon and hurls knives at him. Later, Rayman again encounters this actress who turns out to be the area's boss, Space Mama, in an astronaut costume. Following her defeat, Rayman learns that Mr. Dark has kidnapped Betilla and imprisoned her in one of the little spheres attached to his hat. Rayman reaches the fifth land, the Caves of Skops, a cave world ruled by Mr. Skops, a giant scorpion. Before he enters he meets Joe, a friendly extraterrestrial, who owns a snack bar whose electric lights have gone out. Joe gives Rayman a firefly to light his way through the cave to reinsert a plug that has fallen out, restoring power to his bar. After crossing a lake and through the caves, Rayman reaches the lair of Mr. Skops and defeats him. After he rescues all of the Electoons, Rayman arrives at the final land, Candy Chateau, made of desserts and crockery. At the end, he faces Mr. Dark who attacks with various disorienting spells. Rayman arrives in the chateau's hall, where Mr. Dark traps him with walls of fire. At the last moment, Electoons retrieve Rayman's ability to punch after Mr. Dark disables it. At this point Mr. Dark (probably using the power of the Great Protoon and Betilla) transforms himself into hybrids of the previous bosses to defeat Rayman. Upon the defeat of the hybrids, Rayman rescues Betilla and recovers the Great Protoon, thus restoring balance to his world. Rayman then takes a vacation with friends and former enemies.  Development  Michel Ancel, the game's lead designer. The Rayman character came from concepts designed by Michel Ancel, Fr√©d√©ric Houde, and Alexandra Steible, with Ancel originally drawing Rayman when he was a teenager, influenced by Russian, Chinese and Celtic fairy tales. Ancel was one of Ubisoft's first hires, having been noticed by the Guillemot brothers for his animation skills. Ancel and Fr√©d√©ric Houde presented a prototype of a game with highly animated features which caught the brothers' interest. Michel Guillemot decided to make the project a key one for the company, establishing a studio in Montreuil to house over 100 developers in 1994, and targeting the new line of fifth generation consoles like the Atari Jaguar and PlayStation. Rayman was initially developed for the Atari ST by Ancel alone. When Houde joined the project, they intended to produce a SNES-CD version and the developers hired animators from a cartoon company that considerably improved the graphics; however, the Super NES CD-ROM Adapter was canceled and the SNES version was cancelled in favor of systems with CD support, leaving this version of the game unfinished but playable. A ROM of an early build of the SNES prototype was later released online by Omar Cornut with Ancel's permission on 3 July 2017. The team felt that the Atari Jaguar was the first system that could handle the graphics they wanted and moved development to a Jaguar version, and advertisements in late 1994 announced the game as a Jaguar exclusive. Focus was later shifted to the PlayStation version due to the system's greater power, ease to program for, and CD technology. The Saturn version came later in the development. 32X and 3DO Interactive Multiplayer versions were also announced, but never released. An expansion pack, Rayman Designer, was released for Microsoft Windows in 1997. It contains a level editor and 24 new levels. A second expansion, Rayman par ses Fans (lit. Rayman by his Fans), was released in 1998. It includes 40 fan-created levels, chosen by Ubisoft.  Release  The game sold 900,000 copies in two years. It is also the best-selling PlayStation game of all time in the United Kingdom, with around 5 million copies sold, beating Tomb Raider II and Gran Turismo in the country. According to Gamasutra, Rayman Advances sales neared 600,000 units \\"during the first half of the 2001/2002 fiscal year\\" alone. The game's sales reached 770,000 copies by the end of March 2002.  Reception  Rayman has been highly acclaimed for its animated 2D graphics, atmosphere, and soundtrack. It was awarded both \\"Best Music in a CD-ROM Game\\" and \\"Best Animation\\" in Electronic Gaming Monthly's 1995 Video Game Awards. Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the PlayStation version a score of 8.625 out of 10 and their \\"Game of the Month\\" award. They highly praised the originality, animation, and musical score, and remarked that it firmly disproved the rumor that the PlayStation cannot do side-scrolling games well. GamePro likewise praised the animation and music, as well as Rayman's many acquired abilities, and commented that \\"Rayman is a dazzling delight and ranks as one of the most visually appealing games of this or any year.\\" A critic for Next Generation, though noting a lack of original gameplay elements, agreed Rayman to be an exceptional game, praising its clever design, depth, graphics, and sound. Entertainment Weekly gave the game an A+. Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the Jaguar version an 8 out of 10, assessing that it is an outstanding platformer on its own terms but pales against the PlayStation version due to the lower sound quality of the music and most especially the slow responsiveness of the controls. GamePro also rated it slightly less than the PlayStation version. However, both magazines noted it as one of the best Jaguar games to date, with GamePro remarking \\"Finally, a game that shows off the Jaguar's capabilities.\\" A critic for Next Generation found the Jaguar version impeccable, venturing that \\"there is little about the PlayStation or Saturn versions that will top this one.\\" Sam Hickman of Sega Saturn Magazine gave the Saturn version a 78%, remarking that \\"if you were just watching somebody else playing the game you could be easily fooled into thinking this was the best thing to appear on the Saturn for quite some time. However, in reality, it's a bit too dull a bit too often, and at times, it's just plain irritating and damned difficult.\\" Japanese reviewers judged the Saturn version similarly, with the game receiving a score a 29 out of 40 by a panel of four reviewers at Famicom Ts≈´shin.\\"New Games Cross Review ‚Äì RAYMAN\\". Sh≈´kan Famicom Ts≈´shin. No.362. Pg.31. 24 November 1995. GamePro, however, called it \\"just what gamers are looking for on the Saturn\\", and compared it favorably to previous Saturn \\"hop- n-boppers\\" Bug! and Astal. They noted that while the graphics and music sometimes seem kiddie-oriented, the challenge is oriented to veteran gamers. They also highly praised the lush visuals and made particular note of the Saturn version's between-level effects. GameSpot gave the MS-DOS version a 7.4, complaining of several issues such as the infrequent save points, but summarizing, \\"Take any good scroller like Donkey Kong or Pitfall, add scintillating colors, wonderfully clever gaming elements, engaging and humorous characters, terrific music, and heaps of whimsy and you have Rayman.\\" Next Generations review praised the graphics, solid game speed even on low-end PCs, \\"multitude of challenges\\", and charming player character, and said the game made a good change of pace from other PC releases.

Opposite the primitive streak in the embryo, ectodermal tissue thickens and flattens to become the neural plate. The region anterior to the primitive knot can be generally referred to as the neural plate. Cells take on a columnar appearance in the process as they continue to lengthen and narrow. The ends of the neural plate, known as the neural folds, push the ends of the plate up and together, folding into the neural tube, a structure critical to brain and spinal cord development. This process as a whole is termed primary neurulation. Signaling proteins are also important in neural plate development, and aid in differentiating the tissue destined to become the neural plate. Examples of such proteins include bone morphogenetic proteins and cadherins. Expression of these proteins is essential to neural plate folding and subsequent neural tube formation. Involvement in primary neurulation Neurulation Generally divided into four, the process of primary neurulation involves the neural plate in the first three steps. The formation and folding of the neural plate is the first step in primary neurulation. This is followed by the refinement and growth of neural plate cells. The third step of primary neurulation does not involve the neural plate per se, but rather the edges of the neural plate, which come together, turning the plate into the start of the neural tube. With the neural plate having folded into a tube, the neural folds come together to complete the fusion of the neural tube. This process is illustrated in the figure to the right, where the neural plate is shown in purple. The lime green marks the edges of the neural plate, which become the neural folds, involved in the folding of the plate to create the neural tube. The figure demonstrates the development of the neural plate into the neural tube, which is where the neural crest cells are derived from as well. In primary neurulation, the layer of ectoderm divides into three sets of cells: the neural tube (future brain and spinal cord), epidermis (skin), and neural crest cells (connects epidermis and neural tube and will migrate to make neurons, glia, and skin cell pigmentation). Development During the stage of neural plate formation the embryo consists of three cell layers: the ectoderm that eventually forms the skin and neural tissues, the mesoderm that forms muscle and bone, and the endoderm that will form the cells lining the digestive and respiratory tracts. The progenitor cells that make up the precursors to neural tissues in the neural plate are called neuroepithelial cells. Stretched over the notochord, the ectodermal cells on the dorsal portion of the embryo are ultimately the ones that form the neural plate. Approximately half of those cells will be induced to remain ectoderm, while the other half will form the neural plate.Human Embryology, Module 7, Section 7.2, http://www.embryology.ch/anglais/hdisqueembry/triderm10.html. There are four stages of neural plate and neural tube formation: formation, bending, convergence, and closure. The formation of the neural plate starts when dorsal mesoderm signals ectodermal cells above it to lengthen into columnar neural plate cells. This different shape distinguishes the cells of the presumptive neural plate from other pre-epidermal cells. If the neural plate is separated by itself, it will still develop to make a thinner plate but will not form a neural tube. If the region containing presumptive epidermis and neural plate tissue is isolated, small neural folds will form. Elongation that occurs throughout the formation of the neural plate and closure of the neural tube is vital; the closing areas of the neural tube are seen to have very increased elongation activity in the midline compared to already closed areas when the plate was beginning to shape itself into a tube. Bending and Convergence of the Neural Plate The bending of the neural plate involves the formation of hinges, where the neural plate is connected to surrounding tissues. The midline of the neural plate is referred to the median hinge point (MHP). Cells in this area, known as medial hinge point cells because of their involvement with this structure, are stabilized and connected to the notochord. They are derived from the area of the neural plate anterior to primitive knot. The notochord will begin the shape changes in MHP cells. These cells will decrease in height and become wedge-shaped. Another type of hinge point occurs dorsal- laterally, referred to as dorsal-lateral hinge point (DLHP). These regions furrow and change shape in the same way as MHP cells do before connecting together to form the neural tube. It was seen in an experiment that without the notochord, the MHP characteristics did not develop correctly, so the neural plate and neural tube formation did not happen properly. The communication between the neural plate and the notochord is important for the future induction and formation of the neural tube. Closure of the neural tube is completed when the neural folds are brought together, adhering to each other. While the cells that remain as the neural tube form the brain and spinal cord, the other cells that were part of the neural plate migrate away from the tube as neural crest cells. After an epithelial‚Äìmesenchymal transition, these cells form the autonomic nervous system and certain cells of the peripheral nervous system. Cell signaling and essential proteins Critical to the proper folding and function of the neural plate is N-cadherin, a type of cadherin protein associated with the nervous system. N-cadherin is critical to holding neural plate cells together. Additionally, cells destined to become neural plate cells express nerve cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) to further neural plate cohesion. Another cadherin, E-cadherin, is expressed by ectodermal cells in the process of neural plate development. BMP-4 Bone morphogenetic protein 4, or BMP4, is a transforming growth factor that causes the cells of the ectoderm to differentiate into skin cells. Without BMP4 the ectoderm cells would develop into neural cells. Axial mesoderm cells under the ectoderm secrete inhibitory signals called chordin, noggin and follistatin. These inhibitory signals prevent the action of BMP4, which would normally make the cells ectoderm; as a result, the overlying cells take their normal course and develop into neural cells. The cells in the ectoderm that circumscribe these neural cells do not receive the BMP4 inhibitor signals and as a result BMP4 induces these cells to develop into skin cells. Neural plate border specifiers are induced as a set of transcription factors. Distalless-5, PAX3 and PAX7 prevent the border region from becoming either neural plate or epidermis. These induce a second set of transcription factors called neural crest specifiers, which cause cells to become neural crest cells. In a newly formed neural plate, PAX3 mRNA, MSX1 mRNA, and MSX1/MSX2 proteins are expressed mediolaterally. When the neural plate begins to fold, rostral areas of the neural plate do not express Pax3 and MSX proteins. Areas caudal to neural tube closure have PAX3 and MSX expression restricted to lateral regions of the neural folds. These fluctuations in mRNA and protein expression allude to how they play a role in differentiation of neural plate cells. Low pSMAD 1, 5, 8 levels allow a greater mobility at the median hinge point than in lateral neural plate cells. This flexibility allows for the pivoting and hinging that allows the buckling and lifting of the neural plate when formatting the neural tube. The neural plate has to be rigid enough for morphogenic movements to occur while being flexible enough to undergo shape and position changes for the transformation to the neural tube. Other animals The neural tube closes differently in various species, the distinctions between humans and chickens being some of the most studied. In humans, the neural tube fuses together from a central region of the embryo and moves outwards. In chickens, neural tube closure begins at the future midbrain region and it closes in both directions. In birds and mammals, the closure does not occur at the same time. In newt and general amphibian embryos, cell division is not a driving role in morphogenesis. Newt embryo cells are much larger and exhibit egg pigmentation to distinguish cells from each other. The newt neural plate doubles in length, decreases in apical width, and increases in thickness. The plate edges rise dorsally and fold toward the midline to form the neural tube. The apical surface area decreases. In chicken embryos, while the neural plate increases in length and decreases in apical width, the thickness of the plate does not change drastically. As the neural plate progresses through the Hamburger- Hamilton stages, the plate thickens until about HH6-7, when the neural plate begins to fold into tube form. The apical surface area increases during neurulation, unlike amphibian embryos. In mouse embryos, there is a large convex-shaped curve to each side of the middle of the plate. This curve has to be reversed as the plate rolls together to form the neural tube. Research Research on the neural plate began in earnest by looking into the determination of the ectoderm and its commitment to the neuronal path. With the development of research and laboratory techniques there have been major advances in the study of neurulation and the development and role of the neural plate in a growing embryo. The use of such techniques vary with the stage of development and overall research goals, but include such methods as cell labeling and grafting.de Vellis J, Carpenter E. General Development of the Nervous System. In: Siegel GJ, Agranoff BW, Albers RW, et al., editors. Basic Neurochemistry: Molecular, Cellular and Medical Aspects. 6th edition. Philadelphia: Lippincott-Raven; 1999. Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK28253/ Cell labelling The process of in situ hybridization (ISH) follows the labeling of a DNA or RNA sequence to serve as an antisense mRNA probe, complementary to a sequence of mRNA within the embryo. Labeling with a fluorescent dye or radioactive tag allows for the visualization of the probe and their location within the embryo. This technique is useful as it reveals specific areas of gene expression in a tissue as well as throughout an entire embryo through whole-mount in situ hybridization. This technique is often used in determination of gene expression necessary for the proper development of the embryo. Marking certain genes in a developing embryo allows for the determination of the exact time and place in which the gene is activated, offering information in the role of the particular gene in development. Similar to the process of in situ hybridization, immunofluorescence (IF) also allows for the determination of particular cell element's roles in development. In contrast to in situ hybridization however, immunofluorescence uses a fluorophore attached to an antibody with biomolecule target, such as proteins, rather than DNA and RNA sequences. The allows for the visualization of biomolecule elements of the cell. In the study of embryogenesis immunofluorescence may be used for purposes similar to hybridization, for the tracking of proteins that are involved in the development of the embryo and their specific time and place of production and use. Current research has expanded on the immunofluorescence technique to combined it with the methods of in situ hybridization, either fluorescent or radioactive. This combination is believed to increase specificity and take away for the limitations of each individual technique. For example, this method with enhance counterstaining in a tissue and multiple protein labeling. Cell grafting Cell grafting in the early stages of embryo development has provided crucial information on cell fates and the processes of determination. Grafting at specific stages of neurulation has advanced research on the signaling necessary for the proper development of the neural plate and other structures. The grafting of the ectoderm and neural structures is very specialized and delicate procedure, requiring the removal and marking of a desired group of cells, followed by their transplantation, for example, into a new area of the embryo. Grafting experiments done in Xenopus and chicken embryos show the neural plate's capability to induce other regions of cells, including the pre-placodal region, a group of ectodermal cells essential to the function of sensory organs.

The two statutes, passed nearly a century apart, approached the issue of employment discrimination very differently: Section 1981 prohibited only discrimination based on race or color, but Title VII also prohibited discrimination on the basis of sex, religion, and national origin. Section 1981, which had lain dormant and unenforced for a century after its passage, allowed plaintiffs to seek compensatory damages and trial by jury. Title VII, passed in the 1960s when it was assumed that Southern juries could not render a fair verdict, allowed only trial by the court and provided for only traditional equitable remedies: back pay, reinstatement, and injunctions against future acts of discrimination. By the time the 1991 Act was passed, both allowed for an award of attorneys' fees. The 1991 Act expanded the remedies available to victims of discrimination by amending Title VII of the 1964 Act. Background Congress had amended Title VII once before, in 1972, when it broadened the coverage of the Act. It was moved to overhaul Title VII in 1991 and to harmonize it with Section 1981 jurisprudence, with a series of controversial Supreme Court decisions: *Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, , which held that an employee could not sue for damages caused by racial harassment on the job because even if the employer's conduct were discriminatory, the employer had not denied the employee the \\"same right... to make and enforce contracts... as is enjoyed by white citizens,\\" the language that Congress chose in passing the law in 1866. *Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, , which made it more difficult for employees of Wards Cove Packing Company to prove that an employer's personnel practices, neutral on their face, had an unlawful disparate impact on them by requiring that they identify the particular policy or requirement that allegedly produced inequalities in the workplace and show that it, in isolation, had that effect. *Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, , which held that the burden of proof shifted, once an employee had proved that an unlawful consideration had played a part in the employer's personnel decision, to the employer to prove that it would have made the same decision if it had not been motivated by that unlawful factor, but such proof by the employer would constitute a complete defense for the employer. *Martin v. Wilks, , which permitted white firefighters who had not been party to the litigation, establishing a consent decree governing hiring and promotion of black firefighters in the Birmingham, Alabama, Fire Department, to bring suit to challenge the decree. *United Automobile Workers v. Johnson Controls, Inc., , which was held that Johnson Controls, Inc. had released a fetal protection policy, which barred all female employees from certain jobs with exposure to high lead, regardless of personal choice to the female. This rule was not in effect for male employees of the same risk, and therefore a discriminatory practice. Changes The Patterson case had attracted much criticism since it appeared to leave employees who had been victimized by racial harassment on the job with no effective remedies, as they could not prove a violation of Section 1981 and could rarely show any wage losses that they could recover under Title VII. In addition, the Court's narrow reading of the phrase \\"make or enforce contracts\\" eliminated any liability under Section 1981 for lost promotions and most other personnel decisions that did not constitute a refusal and that was the end to hire or a discharge on the basis of race or color. Congress addressed the issue by redefining the phrase \\"make and enforce contracts\\" to include \\"the making, performance, modification, and termination of contracts, and the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions of the contractual relationship.\\" Congress also clarified that Section 1981 applied to both governmental and private discrimination, the issue that the Supreme Court originally announced it would decide in Patterson. Congress also believed that the Wards Cove case made it too difficult to prove disparate impact claims under Title VII. The Act was amended to provide that an employee could prove a case by showing either that an individual practice or group of practices resulted in \\"a disparate impact on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, and the respondent fails to demonstrate that such practice is required by business necessity.\\" Congress added, however, \\"The mere existence of a statistical imbalance in an employer's workforce on account of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin is not alone sufficient to establish a prima facie case of disparate impact violation.\\" While the majority in Congress supported the burden-shifting rule in Price Waterhouse, it was uncomfortable with an employer's ability to prove that it would have made the same decision in any event, as a complete defense in a case in which it had been shown that race or gender or another unlawful factor played a significant role in its decision. Congress amended the Act to provide that the employer's proof that it would have made the same decision in any case was a defense to back pay, reinstatement and other remedies but not to liability per se. The practical effect of this change was to allow a party that proved that the employer discriminated but could not show that it made any practical difference in the outcome could still recover attorney's fees after showing that the employer discriminated, even if no other remedy was awarded. Finally, Congress limited the rights of non-parties to attack consent decrees by barring any challenges by parties who knew or should have known of the decree or who were adequately represented by the original parties. The Court also authorizes jury trials on Title VII claims and allows Title VII plaintiffs to recover emotional distress and punitive damages, while imposing caps on such relief under Title VII. The 1991 Act also made technical changes affecting the length of time allowed to challenge unlawful seniority provisions, to sue the federal government for discrimination, and to bring age discrimination claims, but it allowed successful plaintiffs to recover expert witness fees as part of an award of attorney's fees and to collect interest on any judgment against the federal government.

The Arcanum was one of the many fantasy RPG games that followed the popularity of Dungeons & Dragons RPG. However, instead of featuring a fictitious world, Arcanum is based in a pseudo-historical version of the real world and features historical mythology and creatures from actual myth, such as hantu, bakru, alastor, bat horin, korupiru, and balaha. Setting The world setting is Earth, but in a fictionalized Antediluvian Age (a quasi-historical/mythical interpretation of the ancient past). Geography The geographic regions and real-world influences are: Mediterranea (Europe), Eria (North America), Tamoanchan (South America), Turan (Arabia), Gondwana (Africa), Jambu (Asia), the Nether Realm (Antarctica), and Anostos and Jotunland (Iceland and Greenland-like). Mythical continents are added: Atlantia (Atlantis), Antilla, Hyperborea, Lemuria, Mu, and others. Game history=Origins The origin of both the \\"Complete Series\\" and eventual \\"Atlantean Trilogy\\" came out of a group of friends, including Vernie \\"Butch\\" Taylor, Steve Cordovano, and dungeon master Stephen Michael Sechi, who were somewhat incessant D&D;/FRP gamers in the early 1980s. This little group also had a penchant for fantasy/sci-fi literature, world mythology, and crypto-zoology, as well as mysticism and the occult. Wanting to expand the magic system and player options available in the FRP games of the time while also minimizing game complexity, they experimented with new and various ideas in their own game play. This culminated in the Arcanum/Atlantean game system which included the introduction of schools of magic and added character classes and monsters. Edition historyThe Compleat Series= A proto-edition of the rules for character classes (professions), magic, and alchemy were published as supplements for any fantasy role playing game (a phrase often used in the 1980s to mean Dungeons and Dragons) in 1983. These books were known as the \\"Compleat Series\\" consisting of The Compleat Adventurer by Stephan Michael Sechi (non-magical professions), The Compleat Spell Caster by Vernie Taylor & Stephen Michael Sechi (magic using professions), and The Compleat Alchemist by Steven Cordovano & Stephan Michael Sechi (an advanced look at alchemy and the one class that uses it to its full potential). All of the material from these three books would be edited and made a part of the core rules for The Arcanum. =First Edition= The main rulebook The Arcanum, noted for its extensive magic and alchemy systems, was first published in 1984. A setting book, The Lexicon: Atlas of the Lost World of Atlantis, was released in 1985. This was followed by The Bestiary in 1986. These two books were republished in 1989 as a single book, with some new material, entitled Atlantis, the Lost World. =Second Edition= This first edition was quickly followed by a cleaned up and expanded Second Edition (as clearly indicated on the cover) in 1985. =Third Edition= In 1996, Death's Edge Games would release a third edition (although this edition was mostly a reprint of the second edition, including all of the original typos; the only real difference was the addition of a new race, the Selkie) of the series with a cover style vastly different from the original two editions. =Atlantis: The Second Age= Khepera Publishing has released an RPG called Atlantis: The Second Age using the Omni System. This game covers the original setting, but not the original rules set. The agreement between K. David Ladage and Jerry D. Grayson is a gentleman's understanding that the material presented in The Arcanum, even where that overlaps with the material in The Lexicon and The Bestiary, are fair game for new games, printings, and/or editions; the material presented in The Lexicon and The Bestiary, even where that overlaps with the material in The Arcanum, is fair game for any new games, printings, and/or editions. =30th Anniversary Edition= In 2012, the rights to The Arcanum were purchased by K. David Ladage. In 2013, doing business as ZiLa Games, he ran a Kickstarter to re-release The Arcanum in a new, cleaned up and re-edited form. The Kickstarter campaign failed after successfully raising the needed funds. Three years of delays and fiscal issues caused the campaign to implode. All backers were reimbursed their entire pledge, receiving their money by 31 March 2015. In 2017, he ran a second Kickstarter to re-release The Arcanum which ended on 28 June of that year. After multiple delays (again, taking years), the PDF of the book was released to the backers and made available on DriveThruRPG on 14 February 2019. The physical books were ordered through Lightning Source to be shipped directly to the backers on 29 March 2019; the book was made available via Print On Demand (POD) via DriveThruRPG on 31 March 2019. This was four years to the day after the backers of the initial Kickstarter were fully reimbursed. Since ZiLa Games owns the rights to The Arcanum, but Khepera Publishing (Jerry D. Grayson) owns the rights to The Lexicon and The Bestiary, the original follow on books will not be released by ZiLa Games. Art Illustrations in the books include ink drawings by artist Bill Sienkiewicz. Nearly all of the art in the 30th Anniversary Edition was done by Cory 'Shonuff' Gelnett.

In addition, she was in the mobile game Pied Piper, Xenosaga I & II, Xenosaga Freaks, as well as the anime Xenosaga: The Animation. Character design Shion Uzuki is the main character of the three episodes of Xenosaga, which have been referred to as \\"Shion's Arc\\" by Namco Bandai. While her role is less prominent in Xenosaga Episode II, which focuses on the character Jr., she is the lead character again in the DS remake Xenosaga I & II. While Shion's surname is \\"Uzuki\\", Takahashi has stated that she is not meant to be a distant relative of the character Citan Uzuki from Xenogears. She does, however, share his liking for science. Shion is portrayed as a girl who tries to overcome the tragic events of her past by \\"looking away from reality and truth\\". Takahashi compared the character's instinctive tendency to run away from things with his very own personality and mindset. A particular point he wanted to explore in the series was Shion \\"looking back at herself [‚Ä¶] wondering how she should live her life\\". When he created Xenosaga, Takahashi made \\"life and death\\" a central theme of the story and gave each character a different outlook on it; Shion and Albedo were conceived as the two characters that eventually develop the \\"ideal compromise towards death\\".Xenosaga: Official Design Materials Xenosaga Episode I has an anime-like art style, while Episode II and III use a more realistic style, and thus she appears differently. She wears glasses in the first and third games. If the player loads a save file from Episode II in Episode III, Shion will obtain special armor that will change her outward appearance. Shion's main theme in Episode I is the ending song \\"Kokoro\\"(heart) performed by Joanne Hogg. The tracks \\"Shion's Crisis\\", \\"Shion ~Memories of the Past~\\" and \\"Shion ~Emotion~\\" were also written for scenes focusing on her. \\"Fighting KOS-MOS\\" plays during a scene that showcases KOS-MOS' power, but composer Yasunori Mitsuda chose to write the track from Shion's perspective for a twist. \\"Shion ~Emotion~\\" was first released on the \\"Kokoro\\" maxi-single as \\"Kokoro Piano Version\\", but Mitsuda changed the track's title in the Xenosaga Original Soundtrack as it fitted Shion best.Xenosaga Original Soundtrack liner notes Appearances= Xenosaga Shion Uzuki was assigned to Vector Industries' First R&D; Division at the young age of 18 in T.C. 4763. Her official title is \\"Chief Engineer of the KOS-MOS Project General Operation System Research Center, Vector Industries First R&D; Division\\". She has a bright, cheerful personality and is ever the optimist, perhaps to hide the scars of losing both her parents as a child and her fianc√© two years ago. In Episode I, it was revealed that she suffers from astraphobia, the result of two traumatic incidents which happened during lightning storms;Shion: I hate‚Ä¶thunder‚Ä¶ (Xenosaga Episode I)Shion: Stop it! I hate thunder! I‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶ I just‚Ä¶really hate thunder‚Ä¶ (Xenosaga Episode I)Shion: Yeah‚Ä¶sorry for losing it earlier. I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶have very good memories of thunder‚Ä¶ (Xenosaga Episode I) losing her parents and later her fianc√©, Kevin. She does not get along well with her brother, Jin Uzuki, who is thirteen years her senior. Shion ends up being swept, along with KOS-MOS and her co-worker Allen Ridgeley, into a conspiracy concerning the very fate of mankind itself. In addition to her intellect (a key factor in her usage of nanotechnology) she learned the same martial arts that Jin and Margulis are masters of as taught by her grandfather. However, unlike Jin and Margulis, she primarily focuses on hand-to-hand combat with use of her M.W.S. Throughout the series, Shion has exhibited abilities unbecoming of most humans. During the Gnosis' assault on the Woglinde, she was caught in close proximity to an FAE (fuel air explosion), which no ordinary human could possibly survive. Shion, however, was blown back by the explosion and left otherwise unscathed. Shion has also demonstrated the peculiar ability to hear the Song of Nephilim, something which only Realians and U.R.T.V.s should be capable of (chaos has also demonstrated this ability, but his status as a \\"human being\\" remains ambiguous at best). During a Gnosis assault on the Woglinde, Shion was caught by a Gnosis in its immaterial state, which was able to grip onto her. She was able to escape crystallization and mysteriously avoided the fate of those whom did not survive such an encounter with a Gnosis, as those that comes into physical contact with Gnosis usually transformed into one. Andrew Cherenkov, for instance, suffered such a fate. This could be due to her status as the \\"Maiden\\" or her possession of what Wilhelm referred to as the \\"Shining Will\\", which is a prerequisite to become a Testament; it is said that those with the Shining Will will not Gnosify. Shion can link to U-DO, and can communicate with it, with U-DO responding to her through this power.Shion: What? Is it calling me? Where are you? Who's calling me? (Xenosaga Episode III)Shion: You're U-DO? (Xenosaga Episode III) During the Miltian Conflict (as a child), after seeing her parents killed by berserk realians she summons the Gnosis from her distress through the Zohar. When she once again experiences this as an adult she loses control and summons Abels Ark (a giant Gnosis). Shion also suffers from the same illness as her mother, which Kevin reveals is caused by communication with U-DO.Kevin: Yes. Everything was supposed to begin here. But in order to awaken Abel, the resonance of the power between them was necessary. The Gnosis that attacked Miltia in the past... did not arrive because of Mizrahi, not Albedo's link to U-DO. No. They were called by Shion, when she was a child. Xenosaga Episode III) Kevin confirms in Episode III that KOS-MOS is gradually killing Shion since KOS-MOS uses the Zohar and U-DO as an energy source.Kevin: Shion, you have an ability that others lack. But that power will eventually cost you your life. That's the reason for your recent headaches. (Xenosaga Episode III) Had U-DO not chosen to let humanity live on, Shion would have ultimately died due to the extreme stress caused by these communications. She has also experienced several unusual perceptions, seeing visions of the young girl named \\"Nephilim\\" and of her deceased Realian nanny Febronia.Nephilim: I am‚Ä¶Nephilim. That‚Äôs what I have been called. Ever since I existed in this form‚Ä¶ (Xenosaga Episode I) It is also revealed in Xenosaga I & II and the database of III that she has the natural ability to see into the \\"Realm of Imaginary Numbers\\", where the Gnosis hail from. Her glasses inhibit this ability and allow her to experience relatively normal perceptions. However, as this sense of hers is not active all the time, and as she \\"has gotten used to it,\\" she removes the glasses when they present an inconvenience to her daily life. Her consciousness has existed since the time of Lost Jerusalem as the maiden and close acquaintance of Mary Magdalene; her brief vision of the distant past was not through KOS-MOS' memory, but through her own. It can be deduced from KOS-MOS' last words that Shion's former self died as a result of being caught up in some larger occurrence, and that KOS-MOS (Mary) had been unable to protect her. After discovering Allen's feelings for her on Michtam, Shion took the first step towards her independence. Shion, so caught up in the memories shared with Kevin Winnicot, had not truly realized the extent of Allen's love for her. Because Allen differs from Kevin in every conceivable way, including attitude, disposition and personal history, Shion felt as though he would be the one able to offer comfort for her sorrowful heart. Thus begins Shion's journey to Lost Jerusalem, wherein humanity's collective consciousness awaits guidance and salvation.Shion: Yes, I know. I made a promise to chaos. I know that somehow I'll reach Lost Jerusalem. (Xenosaga Episode III) Other appearances Shion makes an appearance in Namco √ó Capcom, when she, M.O.M.O., and KOS-MOS appear in the middle of Shibuya during a series of dimensional disturbances, in time to help the main characters against a Gnosis attack. In the game, Shion is paired with MOMO as a single unit. Bandai has released Shion figurines as part of the Xenosaga Legend toy set. Reception Shion as seen in Xenosaga Episode I has been called \\"cute\\" and \\"likable\\" by critics. IGN also praised the more realistic character designs seen in Episode II, noting that Shion's design became \\"more flattering\\", having \\"been injected with ye old 'Babe Serum.'\\" RPGamer also praised the design change, though they felt that Shion's lack of glasses in that episode was \\"amusing\\". In a review of the first volume of Xenosaga: The Animation, GameSpot compared Shion and KOS-MOS to \\"the ultimate fanboy fan- service pair\\", feeling that Shion was an example of a \\"cute, yet smart glasses girl\\". Personalitywise, Shion has been described by GameSpot as being \\"pretty straightforward as a heroine, though maybe a little ditzy for someone who's supposedly one of the best scientists in the galaxy\\". On the other hand, IGN felt that the character was \\"more complicated than she first lets on\\". In a review of the Xenosaga anime, another reviewer from IGN noted that Shion's idealism and naivety were out of place considering her tragic past, and that it was annoying \\"since it seems to happen a lot with anime heroines\\". GameSpy echoed this concern, stating that Shion was \\"often na√Øve to the point of unbelievability\\". On voice acting, GameSpy felt Shion in Episode I was \\"excellent\\" despite the game not having \\"Hollywood-quality\\" acting. The site called the character a \\"calm center\\" around which the rest of the game is built. IGN considered Shion's voice acting was \\"surprisingly strong\\", and that it was a good point since she was the character the player would hear most. In Episode II however, PALGN felt that Shion's voice actress was \\"terrible\\" and overacting compared to most other characters.

There were a number of changes made to the GameCube and Xbox releases, including: * Increased frame rate (60fps) * A new main menu. * A new intro and a new outro. * New cutscenes where Murfy explains the basics to the different game types. * Difficulty levels in the single-player mode (Beginner, Pro and Master) * Modified level designs for some levels. * A new playable character (Dark Globox) and new unlockable skins (such as Dark Rayman). * A new game mode (Time Attack). * A new Race Exhibition level (Extreme Slide) * Three new Battle Exhibition levels (Pac- Arena, Low Gravity Arena and Kura√Ø) * Born to Slide and Speed Stress renamed to Speed Stress and Run, Run respectively. * Race, Lum Spring and Lum Fight renamed to Obstacle Racing, Freeze Combat and Total Fight respectively. * The removal of five game modes (Training, Popolopo√Ø, Lums, Kill Time and Capture the Fly) * The removal of two Bonus League race levels (Big Bang and On and On) * Modified character themes for Globox and Tily for all race levels. * New character themes for every character in the Factory race levels. Rayman Rush Rayman Rush is an on-foot racing game developed by Ubi Soft Shanghai and published by Ubi Soft. The game is a remake of Rayman M for the PlayStation, but only features the racing half of the game. The Teensies were replaced with a new character (Globette), sports conversions of twelve race tracks (the level Treasure Ship was removed and replaced with Canopy) and a slightly edited introduction movie. The game only supports up to two players, due to the PlayStation's hardware limitations. Reception Rayman M received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. GameSpot criticized the lack of gameplay variety, stating that \\"You typically need only two laps on a course to figure out a path through the level that will defeat the computer racers.\\" For the PC platform, Rayman M received \\"negative\\" reviews according to Metacritic.

Layne was originally raised in the Church of God (Anderson), where his father was a minister. In a booklet written by Mr. Layne in the early 1980s, he claimed to be an ex-heroin addict who spent years dealing drugs and living a life of crime and sin on the streets of San Francisco. Layne began preaching in the Church of God (Guthrie, OK) after his conversion in May 1980. Members of this group believe that they are ordained by both prophecy and divine command to restore the church of God as it was in the Book of Acts, and believes that it alone is the only true church. Most of Daniel Layne's beliefs in the Revelation scripture originated from some ministers who had left the Church of God (Anderson) reformation movement thirty or so years earlier. This teaching is upheld by the official eschatology, which is a form of church historicism. This Church of God (Restoration) teaches that the sounding of the 7th Trumpet referenced in the Book of Revelation began around the same year in 1980 when Daniel Layne was saved, alleging that there was a general discontent among many of its current adherents that were in various Churches of God at that time. A variation of this \\"7th Seal message\\" had been taught in other Churches of God for approximately 50 years prior to this point.  Church government  The group is officially presbyterian-hierarchical in ecclesiastical polity, with the General Ministerial Body having the greatest authority in doctrine and practice, especially those recognized as apostles. However, many ex- members claim that it was actually episcopalian, with Daniel Layne acting as de facto archbishop until his death in 2011. Daniel Layne was officially held to be an Apostle in the Church of God (Restoration). Since Daniel Layne's death, the church's chief apostle is D. Ray Tinsman of Greenville, Ohio, along with 11 other ministers that are also apostles. While there is no official church headquarters, individual congregations are expected to be more than a loose association, and submit to the decisions of the General Ministerial Body. There is no formal membership, however, those who attend regularly are expected to strictly adhere to the standards and theology taught by leaders in the movement. The General Ministerial Body consists of male and female ministers, who call themselves \\"The Seventh Trumpet Angel Ministry\\". Ministers must be saved and sanctified, not divorced and remarried, and agree with the Church's theology and practice. They must also feel personally called of God and have the approval of the General Ministerial Body. Beliefs and doctrines The group considers itself to be \\"anti-denominational\\", with roots in the holiness movement and Church of God (Anderson) of which Daniel Sidney Warner was one of the leading ministers in the late 19th century. Warner had been associated with the Churches of God General Conference), and was greatly influenced by the \\"anti-denominational\\" teaching of that denomination. This group also claims to closely follow all the teachings of the Bible, and practices excommunication to some former members it considers to be errant from its very strict and real interpretation of the Bible and actively work against the group. They believe and teach that they are the one and only true church and that anyone outside of their group who is saved will eventually join them.http://www.churchofgod-restoration.com/documents/excommunication.pdf The doctrines of the Church of God (Restoration) are similar to the original doctrines of the Church of God (Anderson), although the \\"Anderson\\" churches are now indistinguishable from most other evangelical churches in the USA. The following is a list of some of the emphasized doctrines and practices: * The Church sees itself to be a restoration of the original church that Jesus built. * As with most Holiness Churches, they believe that one willful sin causes a person to lose his salvation. * Entire sanctification as a second work of grace after justification by faith * Unification of the children of God in one body. They teach that God's will is to unite his people one more time in one visible Church before he returns to take them home. Every person that is a true Christian will become a part of the movement once they hear the sound of the 7th Trumpet, which is interpreted to be the preaching and teaching of God through the body of Christ, which the group feels is their movement. * Divine, physical healing and anointing with oil by the Elders. * Holy kiss when greeting each other with the same sex, in a non-sexual way. * Separation from the world by dress and actions, including: ** Men wear primarily black dress clothes with white shirts to worship services, but casual dress is worn during the week, excluding denim ** Neckties, wedding rings, and jewelry are forbidden, as are other superfluous and unneeded articles of dress ** Bright colors, such as red, orange, yellow, bright green and bright blue, are not worn, as the church believes that they portray a potentially worldly spirit and draw unnecessary attention to themselves. ** Women wear dark-colored hose and girls wear thick stockings, skirts with wide pleats to the ankles, and vests that cover their waistline. ** Most male adherents wear beards. ** Women and girls do not cut their hair, and wear it tied back at all times in a plain bun (women) or braids (girls) * Church worship is a capella. This is similar in practice to the Churches of Christ and plain Anabaptist churches, believing that musical instruments in worship are not sanctioned by scripture.http://www.churchofgod.net/musical- instruments-in-worship/ * Strong focus on outreach and missionary endeavors. * No discrimination based on ethnicity, language, culture, gender, or social status. They reject the concept of race distinctions and believe there is only one human race. * Strong teaching against sexual immorality, including homosexuality. * Nonresistance, precluding all military service and employment as police officers. * No remarriage following divorce, although reunification with a first spouse is permitted if that relationship was not adulterous for both spouses. This differs from what Warner taught. * Belief in corporal punishment of children, as a last resort. They believe that they are forbidden to spank their children by hand, because the hand is considered an instrument of love, guidance and comfort.http://www.familyaid.org/html/0160.html * Excommunication of those that leave the Church and actively attempt to help others leave the Church, or are a threat to the Church. Controversies The Church of God (Restoration) remains the focus of controversy, with many accusations leveled by ex-members across the world. Most of the accusations stem from well-known doctrines of the Church of God (Restoration) such as divine healing, shunning, excommunication. The Church rejects the notion of patriarchy, i.e. that the husband is the spiritual head of the family. The Church teaches rather that the husband is the head of the home in domestic affairs and bears some responsibility for spiritual matters, but that the pastor has more authority in spiritual matters than the father/husband holds. For a number of years, they did not believe in accessing any medical help, nor using medicine, but divine healing from God. There have been a number of deaths within the group, of newborns, children, and adults, which normal medical procedures may have prevented. However, due to political and judicial pressure in 2001, a resolution was approved by the General Ministerial Body that now recommends that all under-age children be provided with appropriate medical care. Adults are free to choose for themselves.https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2001/08/02/canadians- flee-in-spanking-dispute/5998af1e-e0c1-45cb-ab74-9153f503ffc8/ Growth The Church of God (Restoration) has about 20 congregations worldwide (with about half in the United States and Canada) as well as mission stations in Haiti, Nepal, India, the Philippines, Kenya and Ireland. They urge all Christians to unite and bind into one visible body of believers, which they believe should be their own. The group draws most of its members from various Anabaptist and Church of God churches, but includes a diversity of backgrounds, both religious and cultural. One method of outreach has been to have a large group of adherents attend conventions or services of other churches (often churches from which members have been previously gleaned) with the apparent goal of gaining new members. In recent years their outreach efforts have increasingly focused on street meetings and new congregations in large urban centers. Bimonthly publication The Gospel Trumpethttp://www.churchofgod.net/gospel- trumpet/ is a bi-monthly publication that is published in English, German, and Russian. Some of its clip-art and writings are copied from the original century-old Gospel Trumpet, with which it has no other continuity. The current publishers claim to follow in the steps of the original Gospel Trumpet by publishing strongly against denominationalism and sin. There is also a bi- monthly paper, The Shining Light, published for the spiritual benefit and growth of children. Eschatology Daniel Sidney Warner and the earlier ministers of the Church of God (Anderson) taught that the restoration of the church was prophesied by the Old Testament prophets, in the New Testament, and in the Book of Revelation. They taught that the time period from 270 to 1530 was the \\"Papal age\\" and 1530 to 1880 was the \\"Protestant age\\", with 1880 being the year the church of God was restored with the full message of salvation, sanctification, and unity of God's people. Warner describes how he came up with these dates in Birth of a Reformation. From a number of scriptures in Daniel and Revelation, he took \\"time, times, and half a time\\", \\"42 months\\" or \\"1260 days\\" (Dan 7:25; 12:7, Rev 11:3; 12:6; 12:14; 13:5;) to mean 1260 years of the \\"Papal age\\", holding that in symbolic language one day is one year. The 1260 years of the \\"Papal age\\" is added to the time that the church lost its unity and purity, which gives the end of the \\"Papal age\\" as 1530 AD. Then using the symbol from Revelation of \\"three days and a half\\" (Rev 11:11), with each day equaling a century, they held that the duration of the Protestant age was 350 years, which brings them to 1880. This date was the beginning of the full restoration of the church of God and called the \\"Evening Light age\\". The Church of God (Restoration) builds the dating of their movement on the same dates as the Church of God (Anderson) earlier ministers did. They also hold that in about 1930 the Church of God (Anderson) as a whole became apostate and there was silence in the spiritual heavens for \\"the space of half an hour\\" (Rev 8:1). This one half-hour is taken to mean 50 years, using one hour in symbolic language as one century. The time of the \\"silence period\\" ended in 1980, which was about the time of the beginning of Daniel Layne‚Äôs ministry. Some reject the date of 1880 and claim the dates 270 and 1530 hold no historical significance and were only obtained by back-dating from 1880. They also point out that while there is Biblical authority to use the symbol of one day for a year (Num 14:34; Eze 4:6), there is no Biblical authority to use one day as a century or one hour as a century, which the Church of God (Restoration) uses to get the 350 years of the Protestant age and the 50 years of the silent time.

It allows for the diagnosis of intrauterine pathology and serves as a method for surgical intervention (operative hysteroscopy). Hysteroscope A hysteroscope is an endoscope that carries optical and light channels or fibers. It is introduced in a sheath that provides an inflow and outflow channel for insufflation of the uterine cavity. In addition, an operative channel may be present to introduce scissors, graspers or biopsy instruments. A hysteroscopic resectoscope is similar to a transurethral resectoscope and allows entry of an electric loop to shave off tissue, for instance to eliminate a fibroid. A contact hysteroscope is a hysteroscope that does not use distention media. Procedure Hysteroscopy has been carried out in hospitals, surgical centers and doctors' offices. It is best carried out when the endometrium is relatively thin, that is after a menstruation. Both diagnostic and simple operative hysteroscopy can be carried out in an office or clinic setting on suitably selected patients. Local anesthesia can be used. Analgesics are not always necessary. A paracervical block may be achieved using a Lidocaine injection in the upper part of the cervix. Hysteroscopic intervention can also be done under general anesthesia (endotracheal or laryngeal mask) or Monitored Anesthesia Care (MAC). Prophylactic antibiotics are not necessary. The patient is in a lithotomy position during the procedure. Cervical dilation The diameter of the modern hysteroscope is generally small enough to conveniently pass the cervix directly. For a proportion of women cervical dilation may need to be performed prior to insertion. Cervical dilation can be performed by temporarily stretching the cervix with a series of dilators of increasing diameter.Laparoscopy and Hysteroscopy. A Guide for Patients, Revised 2012. From the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, Patient Education Committee Misoprostol prior to hysteroscopy for cervical dilation appears to facilitate an easier and uncomplicated procedure only in premenopausal women. Insertion and inspection The hysteroscope with its sheath is inserted transvaginally guided into the uterine cavity, the cavity insufflated, and an inspection is performed. =Insufflation Media= The uterine cavity is a potential cavity and needs to be distended to allow for inspection. Thus, during hysteroscopy, either fluids or CO2 gas is introduced to expand the cavity. The choice is dependent on the procedure, the patient‚Äôs condition, and the physician's preference. Fluids can be used for both diagnostic and operative procedures. However, CO2 gas does not allow the clearing of blood and endometrial debris during the procedure, which could make the imaging visualization difficult. Gas embolism may also arise as a complication. Since the success of the procedure is totally dependent on the quality of the high- resolution video images in front of the surgeon's eyes, CO2 gas is not commonly used as the distention medium. Electrolytic solutions include normal saline and lactated Ringer‚Äôs solution. Current recommendation is to use the electrolytic fluids in diagnostic cases, and in operative cases in which mechanical, laser, or bipolar energy is used. Since they conduct electricity, these fluids should not be used with monopolar electrosurgical devices. Non- electrolytic fluids eliminate problems with electrical conductivity, but can increase the risk of hyponatremia. These solutions include glucose, glycine, dextran (Hyskon), mannitol, sorbitol and a mannitol/sorbital mixture (Purisol). Water was once used routinely, however, problems with water intoxication and hemolysis discontinued its use by 1990. Each of these distention fluids is associated with unique physiological changes that should be considered when selecting a distention fluid. Glucose is contraindicated in patients with glucose intolerance. Sorbitol metabolizes to fructose in the liver and is contraindicated if a patient has fructose malabsorption. High- viscous Dextran also has potential complications which can be physiological and mechanical. It may crystallize on instruments and obstruct the valves and channels. Coagulation abnormalities and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have been reported. Glycine metabolizes into ammonia and can cross the blood brain barrier, causing agitation, vomiting and coma. Mannitol 5% should be used instead of glycine or sorbitol when using monopolar electrosurgical devices. Mannitol 5% has a diuretic effect and can also cause hypotension and circulatory collapse. The mannitol/sorbitol mixture (Purisol) should be avoided in patients with fructose malabsorption. When fluids are used to distend the cavity, care should be taken to record its use (inflow and outflow) to prevent fluid overload and intoxication of the patient. Interventional procedures If abnormalities are found, an operative hysteroscope with a channel to allow specialized instruments to enter the cavity is used to perform the surgery. Typical procedures include endometrial ablation, submucosal fibroid resection, and endometrial polypectomy. Hysteroscopy has also been used to apply the Nd:YAG laser treatment to the inside of the uterus. Methods of tissue removal now include electrocautery bipolar loop resection, and morcellation. Indications View of a submucous fibroid by hysteroscopy Hysteroscopy is useful in a number of uterine conditions: * Asherman's syndrome (i.e. intrauterine adhesions). Hysteroscopic adhesiolysis is the technique of lysing adhesions in the uterus using either microscissors (recommended) or thermal energy modalities. Hysteroscopy can be used in conjunction with laparascopy or other methods to reduce the risk of perforation during the procedure. * Endometrial polyp. Polypectomy. * Abnormal uterine bleeding * Adenomyosis * Endometrial ablation (Some newer systems specifically developed for endometrial ablation such as the Novasure do not require hysteroscopy) * Myomectomy for uterine fibroids. * Congenital uterine malformations (also known as Mullerian malformations). * Evacuation of retained products of conception in selected cases. * Removal of embedded IUDs. The use of hysteroscopy in endometrial cancer is not established as there is concern that cancer cells could be spread into the peritoneal cavity. Hysteroscopy has the benefit of allowing direct visualization of the uterus, thereby avoiding or reducing iatrogenic trauma to delicate reproductive tissue which may result in Asherman's syndrome. Hysteroscopy allows access to the utero-tubal junction for entry into the Fallopian tube; this is useful for tubal occlusion procedures for sterilization and for falloposcopy. Complications A possible problem is uterine perforation when either the hysteroscope itself or one of its operative instruments breaches the wall of the uterus. This can lead to bleeding and damage to other organs. If other organs such as bowel are injured during a perforation, the resulting peritonitis can be fatal. Furthermore, cervical laceration, intrauterine infection (especially in prolonged procedures), electrical and laser injuries, and complications caused by the distention media can be encountered. The use of insufflation (also called distending) media can lead to serious and even fatal complications due to embolism or fluid overload with electrolyte imbalances. Particularly the electrolyte-free insufflation media increase the risk of fluid overload with electrolyte imbalances, particularly hyponatremia, heart failure as well as pulmonary and cerebral edema. The main factors contributing to fluid overload in hysteroscopy are: * Hydrostatic pressure of the insufflation media * Amount of exposed blood vessels, such as being increased in endometrial ablation and myomectomy. * Duration of the hysteroscopy procedure. Women in fertile age are at increased risk of resultant hyponatremic encephalopathy, likely because of increased level of estrogens. The overall complication rate for diagnostic and operative hysteroscopy was 2% with serious complications occurring in less than 1% of cases using older methods. Morcellation has fewer complications than electrocautery, less than 0.1%. Epub 2014 Aug 14 Epub 2015 Apr 14 Severe Pain The English Member of Parliament, Lyn Brown (West Ham, Labour), has spoken twice in the House of Commons on behalf of constituents who have been coerced into completing unbearably painful outpatient hysteroscopies without anaesthesia. Lyn Brown cites numerous instances of women throughout England being held down by nurses in order to complete an ambulatory hysteroscopy and thus avoid the expense of safely monitored sedation or general anaesthetic.Hansard : 19 December 2013; and ‚Ä¢ Hansard : 18 December 2014 A petition to grant NHS patients full information about the risks of severe outpatient hysteroscopy pain, and the upfront choice of local anaesthetic, sedation, epidural or general anaesthetic was launched in summer 2018. 'End barbaric NHS hysteroscopies with inadequate pain-relief'. It asks the Secretary of State for Health to ensure that: 1\\\\. All NHS hysteroscopists have advanced training in pain medicine. 2\\\\. All hysteroscopy patients receive full written information before the procedure, listing the risks and benefits and explaining that local anaesthetic may be painful and ineffective against the severe pain of cervical dilation, womb distension and biopsy. 3\\\\. All hysteroscopy services are adequately funded so that BEFORE their procedures patients may choose no anaesthesia/ local anaesthesia/ safely monitored conscious sedation/ epidural/ general anaesthetic. 4\\\\. The Best Practice Tariff financial incentive, which rewards NHS Trusts who perform a high percentage of hysteroscopies in outpatients without a trained anaesthetist, is abolished.

Known for playing major works, he played compositions by Ralph Vaughan Williams, Malcolm Arnold, Darius Milhaud and Arthur Benjamin. During his later career he collaborated with Sting, Elton John, Kate Bush and Cerys Matthews. Early life Adler was born in Baltimore, Maryland, to Sadie Hack and Louis Adler. They were a Jewish family. He graduated from Baltimore City College high school. He taught himself harmonica, which he called a mouth organ. He played professionally at 14. In 1927, he won a contest sponsored by the Baltimore Sun, playing a Beethoven minuet, and a year later he ran away from home to New York. After being referred by Rudy Vall√©e, Adler got his first theatre work, and caught the attention of orchestra leader Paul Ash, who placed Adler in a vaudeville act as \\"a ragged urchin, playing for pennies\\".Current Biography 1944, pp. 3‚Äì5 Career From there, he was hired by Florenz Ziegfeld and then by Lew Leslie again as an urchin. He broke the typecasting and appeared in a dinner jacket in the 1934 Paramount film Many Happy Returns, and was hired by theatrical producer C. B. Cochran to perform in London. He became a star in the United Kingdom and the Empire, where, it has been written, harmonica sales increased 20-fold and 300,000 people joined fan clubs.\\". Adler was one of the first harmonica players to perform major works written for the instrument, often written for him: these include Jean Berger's Concerto for Harmonica and Orchestra \\"Caribbean\\" (1941), Cyril Scott's Serenade (harmonica and piano, 1936), Vaughan Williams' Romance in D flat for harmonica, piano and string orchestra; premiered New York, 1952, Milhaud's Suite Anglaise (Paris, May 28, 1947), Arthur Benjamin's Harmonica Concerto (1953), and Malcolm Arnold's Harmonica Concerto, Op. 46 (1954, written for The Proms). He recorded all except the Scott Serenade, some more than once. Earlier, Adler had performed transcriptions of pieces for other instruments, such as violin concertos by Bach and Vivaldi ‚Äì he played his arrangement of Vivaldi's Violin Concerto in A minor with the Sydney Symphony. Other works he played in harmonica arrangements were by Bart√≥k, Beethoven (Minuet in G), Debussy, Falla, Gershwin (Rhapsody in Blue), Mozart (slow movement from the Oboe Quartet, K. 470), Poulenc, Ravel (Bol√©ro), Stravinsky and Walton. During the 1940s, Adler and the dancer Paul Draper formed an act and toured nationally and internationally, performing individually then together in each performance. One popular number was Gershwin's \\"I Got Rhythm\\". During the McCarthy era he was accused of being a communist and refused to cooperate with the House Un- American Activities Committee (HUAC). After being blacklisted and an unsuccessful libel suit decided in 1950, he moved to the United Kingdom in 1951 and settled in London, where he remained the rest of his life. Another source indicates he stayed in London from 1949. The 1953 film Genevieve brought him an Oscar nomination for his work on the soundtrack, and great wealth. His name was originally removed from the credits in the United States due to blacklisting. His other film scores included A Cry from the Streets (1958), The Hellions (1961), The Hook (1963), King & Country (1964) and A High Wind in Jamaica (1965). He also scored a hit with the theme song of the French Jacques Becker movie Touchez pas au grisbi with Jean Gabin, written by Jean Wiener. In 1959, a reviewer from the Village Voice called Adler \\"a great artist\\" after watching his twice-nightly performances at the Village Gate. In 1994, for his 80th birthday, Adler and George Martin produced an album of George Gershwin songs, The Glory of Gershwin, on which they performed \\"Rhapsody in Blue.\\" The Glory of Gershwin reached number 2 in the UK albums chart in 1994. Adler was a musician and showman. Concerts to support The Glory of Gershwin showed he was a competent pianist. He opened each performance with Gershwin's \\"Summertime\\", playing piano and harmonica simultaneously. The album included Peter Gabriel, Oleta Adams, Elton John, Sting, Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora, Meat Loaf, Sin√©ad O'Connor, Robert Palmer, Cher, Kate Bush, Elvis Costello, Courtney Pine, Issy Van Randwyck, Lisa Stansfield and Carly Simon, all of whom sang Gershwin tunes with an orchestra and Adler adding harmonica solos. Acting, writing and wartime radio Adler appeared in five movies, including Sidewalks of London (1938), in which he played a harmonica virtuoso named Constantine. His other film appearances were in Three Daring Daughters (1948) playing himself; Music for Millions (1944) playing Larry; The Singing Marine (1937) playing Larry; and The Big Broadcast of 1937 (1936). He was a prolific letter writer, his correspondence with Private Eye becoming popular in the United Kingdom. Adler wrote an autobiography entitled It Ain't Necessarily So in 1985, and was food critic for Harpers & Queen. He appeared on the Jack Benny radio program several times, entertaining disabled soldiers in the US during World War II. A further biography, Me and My Big Mouth appeared in 1994 but he told The Free-Reed Journal: \\"That's a lousy book and I don't like it; it's ghosted. ... [It] has a certain amount of factual material but the author completely missed my style and my voice. That's why I hate the book.\\" Personal life Adler married Eileen Walser in 1952; they had two daughters and one son. They divorced in 1957. He married Sally Kline in 1959; they had one daughter, Marmoset. They divorced in 1963. At the time of his death, in addition to his children, he also had two grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. His son Peter Adler fronted the band, Action, and others in Dublin, Ireland in the late 1960s. Adler was an atheist. His brother, Jerry Adler (1918‚Äì2010) was also a harmonica player. Adler was a close friend of Peter Stringfellow who hosted his birthday parties at his central London club for at least the last ten years of his life.

It is located in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kansas City in Kansas and sponsored by the St. Benedict's Abbey (monastery) and Mount St. Scholastica (convent) in Atchison, KS. The school became Maur Hill‚ÄìMount Academy with the merger of the two long established schools. Maur Hill Prep School (1919) was an all-boys school and Mount St. Scholastica Academy (1863), an all-girls school. Maur Hill - Mount Academy is a Benedictine school with a Raven mascot representing Benedictine symbolism. It is also affiliated with Benedictine College (BC) in Atchison Kansas. Its colors are navy blue, black and gold. The student population is around 190-220 students (about 80-90 boarding and 100-120 day students from the surrounding area. Boarding students attend from many states across the US and approximately 50 of the boarding students are international students. History The Benedictine Sisters of Mount St. Scholastica began educating girls in 1863 in Atchison, KS. The college section of their school merged in 1971 with their counterpart in Atchison, St. Benedict's College which was an all-boys college. The high school girls continued their education on the Mount's campus as Mount St. Scholastica Academy. St. Benedict's and Mount St. Scholastica's college sections eventually merged to form the present-day Benedictine College. The Benedictine Monks began educating boys in 1858 in Atchison, KS. In 1919 the monks obtained additional property in Atchison and moved the younger boys to the new campus. It was originally St. Benedict's Maur Hill and later Maur Hill. In 2003, Maur Hill and Mount St. Scholastica Academy unified their school's strengths and merged into Maur Hill‚ÄìMount Academy. Campus Maur Hill‚ÄìMount Academy is located on a spacious 90 acre campus that contains several buildings and sports fields. All buildings and activity areas are within steps of each other. * Fr. Edwin Watson Academic Building * John Flynn Athletic Center (Workout center) * Gymnasium (Basketball, volleyball, indoor batting cage) * St. Michael's Dining hall * Howard Hall Residency Center (Girls Dorms) * St. Leos Residency Center (Boys Dorms) * Guy Galley Football Field * Practice Football Field * Soccer Fields * Baseball field * Centrally-located chapel on campus Academics Regular high school courses, honors courses, college courses and AP courses are all available. Upper level students also are able to take college courses at Benedictine College. The school accepts student of average or above average intelligence that plan to continue their education into college. A challenging and supportive academic environment is provided at the school with an academic assistance program, and beyond the school day in the dormitories with evening study halls and tracking academic progress. Faith MH-MA is a Catholic school with deep roots instilled from the Sisters at Mount St. Scholastica and the Monks of St. Benedict's Abbey in Atchison, KS. The school holds close the traditions of their Benedictine heritage which is reflected in the school motto; ‚ÄúOra et Labor‚Äù (Pray and Work). Students of all faiths and backgrounds are welcomed and do attend. Athletics and Clubs Maur Hill‚ÄìMount Academy is part of the Northeast Kansas League and has many sports and clubs for students to be involved in during the year.

House System The school separates the student body into four (4) diverse and evenly represented groups of the school community, and each group is known as a ‚ÄúHouse‚Äù. The Houses are named after St. Sebastian, St. George, St. Gabriel, and Mother Teresa. The House system is student-led and exists to strengthen the school community and provide leadership opportunities. Community service, activities, and student government are a part of the House System. Faculty advisers are assigned to each House and ensure a student's personal, academic, and spiritual growth is being supported. Each House breakdowns into smaller groups called a ‚ÄúFamily‚Äù in which students are assigned a teacher adviser . Each ‚ÄúFamily‚Äù will meet with their teacher adviser three (3) times a week. The Houses compete against one another in intellectual, athletic, artistic, and other competitions. A point scoring system is in place for individual student and House points. Weekly and monthly House winners have special privileges or awards, with a House Cup and special trip awarded to the winning House at the end for the school year. Accreditation and association memberships Maur Hill - Mount Academy is fully accredited by AdvancED and maintains memberships or association in the Secondary School Admission Test Board (SSATB), Catholic Boarding School Association (CBSA), Small Boarding School Association (SBSA), the Cardinal Newman Society, and the National Catholic Education Association (NCEA). Although an independent school with primary sponsorship from St. Benedict's Abbey and the Mount St. Scholastica Monastery, it is recognized and maintains connection with Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kansas City in Kansas. Maur Hill - Mount Academy competes athletically and academically as a member of the nine school Northeast Kansas League, as well as participates in further competitions with other schools due to the number of sports/activities offered at the school. The school adheres to all state and league guidelines and students have the opportunity to participate in tournaments and competition for league and state titles.

It is based on the book of the same name by Patrick Galvin and is based on true events. Plot The film is set in 1939, on the brink of World War II, in the St. Judes Reformatory School, a ruthless Irish school for boys. Grey, gloomy and ruled by the sadistic Brother John (Iain Glen), the school prefers punishment to rehabilitation. But new lay teacher William Franklin (Aidan Quinn), fresh from the frontline of the Spanish Civil War, fights to liberate the boys from their oppressors. Two young boys have key roles in the film. Patrick Delaney 743 (Chris Newman) arrives at the school aged 13 and a half. He, like all the boys, is allocated a number which the brothers use. Franklin, however, always uses the boys' names. Delaney is an attractive boy and he receives the unwelcome attentions of a pedophile brother, Brother Mac (Marc Warren), who molests and rapes the boy in the school toilets. The boy tells of his ordeal to a visiting priest in confession only to be told not to say a word to anyone. Word of Delaney's confession reaches Brother Mac who punishes the boy by forcing him under a cold shower naked, then giving him his clothes so they are also wet. The other boy is Liam Mercier 636 (John Travers). Mercier is one of the few boys who can read and write, but is otherwise a hard case. Franklin befriends the boy and interests him in poetry, some of it written by communist sympathisers. Mercier and Franklin both challenge the authority of Brother John - Mercier by protesting at the vicious beating of two brothers on Christmas Day, and Franklin by stepping in and actually stopping the whipping. Brother John bides his time and, having tricked Mercier into coming out of class, beats him continuously in front of Brother Mac in the refectory. Franklin is eventually told by Brother Mac that Mercier is in the refectory, after which Franklin discovers Mercier's dead body. He carries the corpse out of the room. Livid, Franklin attacks Brother John, calling him a murderer. Brothers John and Mac are taken from the school by the Church authorities (not the Police). At Mercier's funeral, Franklin tells the other boys that his death was murder, before kissing the coffin. Franklin decides he has to leave the school, but is persuaded to stay at the last minute by Delaney reciting a moving poem across the playground. Franklin drops his bags and, in a touching final scene, Delaney runs towards Franklin and jumps up to hug him while all the other boys gather round in love and affection for their saviour. Production The film took over four years to make because of difficulties getting it started; some were casting problems, others to do with raising finance. One casting problem was finding the ideal boy to play Liam Mercier, who the director felt was vital to cast well. Eventually they auditioned John Travers, a boy from an Irish boxing club with no previous acting experience. Aidan Quinn had been attached to the script for two and a half years before production. It was filmed on location in Co Cork and Co Kerry Ireland. The school scenes were filmed at Col√°iste Iosag√°n, a former De La Salle college in Ballyvourney. It was an Irish/Danish/UK/Spanish co-production, and was produced with the support of investment incentives for the Irish film industry provided by the Government of Ireland.

The falloposcope is inserted into the tube through its opening in the uterus at the proximal tubal opening via the utero- tubal junction; technically it could also be inserted at the time of abdominal surgery or laparoscopy via the distal fimbriated end. A distinction is sometimes made between falloposcopy and salpingoscopy (with salpinoscopy being laparascopic.) In some contexts the terms are equated. Indications Falloposcopy has been primarily used in diagnosis and management of tubal infertility, however, it is generally not considered part of the routine work- up for infertility. Most tubal problems in women with infertility are treated by IVF. There is no established role for falloposcopy for evaluation of other tubal pathology. Instrumentation The first modern falloposcope that was described was the coaxial system by Kerin in 1970. Later the linerar-everting catheter (LEC) system was introduced. A coaxial falloposcope is an microendoscope of 0.5 mm diameter that is flexible and contains optical and illuminating fibers; it has a magnifying capacity. The coaxial system needs a hysteroscope for its uterine passage. In contrast, the LEC system consists of an external unfurling ballon catheter with an internal endoscope that is used transcervically without the need for a hysteroscope. Procedure The patient needs general anesthesia or conscious sedation for the duration of the procedure and is in a lithotomy position. For the coaxial system initially a hysteroscope is introduced into the uterus to identify the proximal tubal ostium. Once the ostium is identified the falloposcope can be inserted through the operative channel of the hysteroscope and advanced. With the LEC system the balloon catheter is advanced into the uterine horn, and then, under endoscopic vision the endoscope is advanced into the tube as the balloon catheter unfurls. Findings can be projected on a videosystem. Findings and interventions The typical method of tubal evaluation, hysterosalpingography, has shortcomings in terms of false negative and false positive results. It has been argued that falloposcopy allows for a more accurate evaluation of the tubal canal. Obstructions, adhesions within the tubal canal, and debris can be identified. The procedure allows removal of debris or filmy adhesions from within the fallopian tube, further in selected cases proximal tubal obstruction can be overcome and the tube can be recanalized allowing for pregnancy. Proximal tubal occlusion has also been overcome by using hysteroscopy with tubal canalization using a catheter, not a falloposcope. Extensive tubal obstruction, however, cannot be overcome by falloposcopy and would require tubal surgery or in vitro fertilization (IVF) to be overcome to achieve a pregnancy. Complications Perforation of a fallopian tube appears the only reported complication and is encountered in about 4-5% of inspected tubes. Limitations In 2001, Rimbach et al. reported in a large multicenter study involving 367 patients on the limitations of the procedure. Problems were encountered in the ability to enter the tubes, and, even when tubes were cannulated, light reflexions or \\"white out\\" from healthy tissue as well as adhesions turned out to be a major problem. Thus, the investigators were able to fully examine tubes in only 2 out of 3 cases; perforations occurred in about 4% of cases. Since then, interest in falloposcopy has declined and few studies have been published.

Martin Cooper of Motorola made the first publicized handheld mobile phone call on a prototype DynaTAC model on April 3, 1973. This is a reenactment in 2007. DynaTAC is a series of cellular telephones manufactured by Motorola, Inc. from 1983 to 1994. The Motorola DynaTAC 8000X commercial portable cellular phone received approval from the U.S. FCC on September 21, 1983. A full charge took roughly 10 hours, and it offered 30 minutes of talk time.\\"The History of Mobile Phone Technology\\". RedOrbit. It also offered an LED display for dialing or recall of one of 30 phone numbers. It was priced at $3,995 in 1984, its commercial release year, equivalent to $ in . DynaTAC was an abbreviation of \\"Dynamic Adaptive Total Area Coverage.\\" Several models followed, starting in 1985 with the 8000s, and continuing with periodic updates of increasing frequency until 1993's Classic II. The DynaTAC was replaced in most roles by the much smaller Motorola MicroTAC when it was first introduced in 1989, and by the time of the Motorola StarTAC's release in 1996, it was obsolete. History The first cellular phone was the culmination of efforts begun at Bell Labs, which first proposed the idea of a cellular system in 1947, and continued to petition the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for channels through the 1950s and 1960s, and research conducted at Motorola. In 1960, electrical engineer John F. MitchellJohn F. Mitchell BiographyThe Top Giants in Telephony Who invented the cell phone? became Motorola's chief engineer for its mobile communication products. Mitchell oversaw the development and marketing of the first pager to use transistors. Motorola had long produced mobile telephones for cars that were large and heavy and consumed too much power to allow their use without the automobile's engine running. Mitchell's team, which included Martin Cooper, developed portable cellular telephony, and Mitchell was among the Motorola employees granted a patent for this work in 1973; the first call on the prototype was completed, reportedly, to a wrong number.Motorola Executive Helped Spur Cellular Revolution, Oversaw Ill-fated Iridium Project, Wall Street Journal, Remembrances, June 20‚Äì21, 2009, p. A10 While Motorola was developing the cellular phone itself, during 1968‚Äì1983, Bell Labs worked on the system called AMPS, while others designed cell phones for that and other cellular systems. Martin Cooper, a former general manager for the systems division at Motorola, led a team that produced the DynaTAC 8000x, the first commercially available cellular phone small enough to be easily carried, and made the first phone call from it. Martin Cooper was the first person to make an analog cellular mobile phone call on a prototype in 1973. The Motorola DynaTAC 8000x was very large compared to phones today. This first cell phone was very expensive when it was released in the USA in 1984. The DynaTAC's retail price, $3,995 (about $ in ), ensured that it would not become a mass-market item; by 1998, when Mitchell retired, cellphones and associated services made up two thirds of Motorola's $30 billion in revenue.John F. Mitchell, Time Magazine Milestones section, July 6, 2009, p.17 On October 13, 1983, David D. Meilahn placed the first commercial wireless call on a DynaTAC from his 1983 Mercedes-Benz 380SL to Bob Barnett, former president of Ameritech Mobile Communications, who then placed a call on a DynaTAC from inside a Chrysler convertible to the grandson of Alexander Graham Bell, who was in Germany for the event. The call, made at Soldier Field in Chicago, is considered to be a major turning point in communications. Later, Richard H. Frenkiel, the head of system development at Bell Laboratories, said about the DynaTAC: \\"It was a real triumph; a great breakthrough.\\" Publications U.S. Patent 3,906,166, September 16, 1975 for a Radio Telephone System. the cell phone.

The original document was refiled by Motorola's legal staff, but has not yet been identified. The seeds of the idea for a portable cell phone can be traced to Dr. James J. Mikulski, which were rejected by Mitchell for lack of sufficient business justifications. It is rumored that when John Mitchell suddenly recognized during an attempted phone call that his 400 MHz phone had inherent limitations, he immediately reversed his previous decision and championed the portable cell phone concept. Description Several prototypes were made between 1973 and 1983. The product accepted by the FCC weighed 28 ounces (790 g) and was 10 inches (25 cm) high, not including its flexible \\"rubber duck\\" whip antenna. In addition to the typical 12-key telephone keypad, it had nine additional special keys: * Rcl (recall) * Clr (clear) * Snd (send) * Sto (store) * Fcn (function) * End * Pwr (power) * Lock * Vol (volume) It employed some of the technology previously used in the ALOHAnet system, including metal‚Äìoxide‚Äìsemiconductor (MOS) transceiver and modem technology. The DynaTAC 8 Series, Classic, Classic II, Ultra Classic, and Ultra Classic II had an LED display, with red LEDs; the DynaTAC International Series with green LEDs, and the DynaTAC 6000XL used a vacuum fluorescent display. These displays were severely limited in what information they could show. The battery allowed for a call of up to 60 minutes, after which it was necessary to charge the phone up to 10 hours in a trickle charger or one hour in a fast charger, which was a separate accessory. While still retaining the DynaTAC name, the 6000XL was completely unrelated to the DynaTAC 8000 Series, in that it was a transportable phone meant for installation in a vehicle. The DynaTAC Series was succeeded by the MicroTAC Series in 1989. Legacy With the removal of analog network cells nearly all over the world, the DynaTAC models running on AMPS or other analog networks are mostly obsolete. Thus, they are more collectors' items than usable telephones. The International series, however, will still work, but only on GSM 900 cells. The DynaTac 8000X, due to its resemblance in size and weight to a standard clay- fired brick, was nicknamed the brick phone by users, a term later applied to other brands as a contrast to smaller handsets appearing in the 1990s. Portability While it might be considered extremely unwieldy by modern standards, at the time, it was considered revolutionary because mobile telephones were bulky affairs installed in vehicles or in heavy briefcases. The DynaTAC 8000X was truly the first mobile telephone which could connect to the telephone network without the assistance of a mobile operator and could be carried about by the user. Accessories In certain markets, a brass swivel antenna was one of the aftermarket accessories then available. Motorola also offered a one-hour desktop charger, though the battery could get quite hot while charging at this accelerated rate. In some cases, this could cause major problems with the battery, occasionally short circuiting it and rendering it unusable. Also, charging the battery at a high enough rate to substantially raise its temperature will cause the battery to wear at an accelerated rate, reducing the number of charge-discharge cycles that can be performed before the battery will need to be replaced. (However, considering the high cost of the DynaTAC, the cost of battery replacement would not typically be a concern to DynaTAC owners.) Available, too, was a snug-fitting zippered leather case which covered the entire body of the phone and had a clear plastic front to make the user interface accessible. It featured a sturdy spring-steel belt clip and a small cutaway at the top to allow the antenna to protrude. Charging could still be performed with the cover on, but change of battery required its removal. Dynatac relates to US phones used on the Dynatac system in the US, not phones in use in the UK.

Plan of Arguim (1721). Arguin () is an island off the western coast of Mauritania in the Bay of Arguin. It is approximately 6x2 km in size, with extensive and dangerous reefs around it. The island is now part of the Banc d'Arguin National Park.  History  The island changed hands frequently during the colonial era. The first European to visit the island was the Portuguese explorer Nuno Trist√£o, in 1443. In 1445, Prince Henry the Navigator set up a trading post on the island, which acquired gum arabic and slaves for Portugal. By 1455, 800 slaves were shipped from Arguin to Portugal every year.Slave Routes - Europe Portugal In 1633, during its Dutch-Portuguese War, the Netherlands seized control of Arguin. It remained under Dutch rule until 1678, with a brief interruption by English rule in 1665. France took over the island in September 1678, but it was then abandoned until 1685. Arguin's aridity and its lack of a good anchorage made long-term European settlement difficult. In 1685, Captain Cornelius Reers of the frigate ' occupied the old Portuguese fort on the island. He successfully concluded a treaty with the native king in which Brandenburg was accepted as a protecting power. The treaty was ratified in 1687 and was renewed in 1698. Arguin remained a colony of Brandenburg until 1721 when the French successfully assaulted the fort and then took control of the island. The Dutch took the fort and island from the French the following year only to lose it again in 1724 to the French. This period of French rule lasted four years; in 1728, it reverted to the control of indigenous peoples. The island was included in the territory of the French colony of Mauritania, and it remained under Mauritanian rule when that country became independent in 1960. In July 1816, the French frigate M√©duse, bound for Senegal, was wrecked off Arguin and 350 lives were lost.

Gaddi herd of sheep and goats, Bharmour Frequently associated with the ancient Bharmour kingdom at Chamba, although they played no major role in its governance, the origins of the Gaddi people are lost in time. There are at least four theories for their arrival in that place, often relying on the intertwining of oral history and myth, and in one case on the dubious ethnohistories of the British Raj era. They are primarily the worshippers of Lord Shiva. A locally made beverage is used for devotion to the Lord. Omacanda HƒÅ·πá·∏çƒÅ discusses the dubiety of these and concludes that \\"Nevertheless, it may be said with due certainty that the present-day Gaddis are the descendants of one of those casteless nomadic shepherds of the Indian plains who once lived around the Barmer area of Rajasthan\\" and infers this from the similarities of various costumes and accessories. According to the 2011 Census of India, the Gaddi population was 1,78,130 in Himachal Pradesh and 46,489 in Jammu Kashmir. The Gaddis of Himachal Pradesh had an adult sex ratio of 1014 and literacy rate of 73.3, whereas those of Jammu and Kashmir had a sex ratio of 953 and literacy of 53.5. They are classified as a Scheduled Tribe in both areas under India's reservation system. ReferencesFurther reading * Verma, V. 1996. Gaddis of Dhauladhar: A Transhumant Tribe of the Himalayas.

The band consisted of: Mikal Moore (vocals), Brice Stephens (vocals), Chuck Schaaf (guitar), Jeff Morgan (bass), and Rodney Moffitt (drums). They released one album, My Soul is Wet, in 1993 for Chrysalis Records before breaking up. Biography=Early days (1991-1992) Influenced by the Beastie Boys, Mikal Moore (born Michael Morehead) and Randy Cross conceived Mutha's Day Out to ‚Äúget chicks.‚Äù The band initially consisted of three vocalists (Mikal, Randy, and Brice Stephens). The name was thought up by Brice and came from a daycare center in Batesville that kids could go to for pre-school in Methodist churches. Jeff Morgan had just been kicked out of a band he and Chuck Schaaf were in when Mikal asked him to be in a band that would sound like \\"Faith No More, Beastie Boys, and Ozzy Osbourne.\\" The band was rounded out by Rodney Moffitt, who played drums, and Lance Branstetter, who played guitar, with Chuck serving as his guitar tech. When the band first came together, Lance was 21 years old, Mikal was 20, Brice was 18, Chuck was 17, Rod was 17, and Jeff was 15. In April 1992, the band traveled to Memphis, Tennessee in search of a cheap recording studio. They found the studio they were looking for belonging to recording engineers Doug Easley and Davis McCain. After producing Mutha's Day Out's first demo in studio, which consisted of 15 tracks, Doug booked the band to play in the Crossroads Music Festival that week. In the same performance, Mutha's Day Out's first, a representative from Chrysalis Records, Karen DuMont (who currently still works with Mikal), was present to see and sign another band. After seeing MDO's performance, she offered them a chance to go to the studio the next day, while receiving a record contract as well. Soon after the band signed a songwriting agreement with leading independent music publisher, Hit & Run Music Publishing, being championed by Joey Gmerek and Dave Massey in the New York and London offices. My Soul is Wet (1993) They went to the studio to record their only album, My Soul is Wet. Randy Cross left the band the day after they got the record label and Lance was kicked out a week afterwards; the band replaced Lance with Chuck. Halfway through the production of the album, Greenforth Pham, a Vietnamese boy who was a close friend of Mikal and Brice's, committed suicide, and thus the album was dedicated in his memory (\\"Green\\"). The album was finished and then released on October 19, 1993. Chrysalis released four singles from the album: \\"Locked\\", \\"My Soul is Wet\\", \\"Green\\" and \\"What U See/We All Bleed Red\\". The first three singles were accompanied by music videos, with \\"Locked\\" being used on a segment of Beavis and Butthead in the episode \\"Crisis Line\\". Tour (1994) Mutha's Day Out toured the United States and Europe from late 1993 to late 1994. They were opening for such bands as Jackyl, King's X, Overkill, Sugartooth, and BulletBoys. Jeff, at one point during the tour, was in a leg brace having dislocated his knee the night before at a club gig in Birmingham, Alabama, but was still insistent on playing. During their tour in the United States, they stayed in cheap hotels to lower the cost of the record company's tour bill. In the European leg of their tour, however, the band gained great notoriety, especially in France. There are many diehard fans to this day that are concentrated around Paris. Their only live record (EP) was recorded in the Virgin Megastore in Paris to a strong audience of loyal fans and contains 5 tracks. The band also performed at major rock festivals such as Winterthur in Switzerland. Breakup (1994) Mikal left the band in September 1994, but this had been discussed and dealt with already with Chrysalis before the album even came out. He was obligated to do the tour, however, and couldn't leave until that part of the deal was fulfilled. After Mikal left, the band decided to call it quits rather than continue forward with a new singer. The main reason the band broke up is that they were all going in different directions musically and it ripped apart the band. Had the band stayed together, Chuck and Jeff would have done most of the writing and gone in a much darker direction (with a sound similar to Kreator). In the aftermath, Mikal obtained the rights to Mutha's Day Out and still owns the rights to this day. Mortal Kombat (1995) Mutha's Day Out appeared in the 1995 movie Mortal Kombat during Scene 2 while Sonya searches for Kano at a nightclub in Hong Kong, amongst a large crowd moshing to them. They received a call on tour and were asked to take a few days to go to Hollywood and film their scene. Their song, \\"What U See\\", is featured on the soundtrack to Mortal Kombat. It is looped three times to form a four-minute song. The looped song also features a short cowbell intro and the removal of the foul language the song had originally contained, although some copies of the soundtrack do have the profanity included. The movie grossed over 100 million dollars and the soundtrack went platinum in 10 days. Today Mikal is married with three daughters and is the lead vocalist for the Christian rock band Circa 71. Brice owns a restaurant and coffee shop in Batesville called ‚ÄúThe Pinto Coffee and Comida‚Äù with his wife; he has one child. Jeff lives in Little Rock and plays for two bands: bass guitar for Deadbird and drums for Rwake; he is married with a son and daughter. Chuck played in Rwake until 2002 and was one of two founding members of Deadbird along with his brother, Phillip; Chuck is married with two kids and works in accounting. Rod lives in Batesville and worked for the city mowing yards, and now works for a contractor hanging dry wall and is married. Lance is married and owns his own recording studio in Batesville; he also helps run a large farming operation owned by his family. Randy is currently a loan officer at a bank in Batesville and teaching banking and accounting classes at a local college. Reunion In January 2012, Mikal announced via his Facebook account that a Mutha's Day Out reunion was in the works, with Chuck and Jeff returning to the band, as well as adding a new drummer and removing the back-up singer. However, further details never emerged. In November 2019, it was announced that a special Mutha‚Äôs Day Out encore featuring Mikal, Brice, Chuck and Jeff would be taking place following Deadbird‚Äôs performance at the Mutants of the Monster Festival in Little Rock, Arkansas in June 2020. This marks the first time all four have been on stage together in over 25 years.

Early life Born into a wealthy family in West Melbourne, Maloney was educated in the Melbourne private school system, the University of Melbourne and St Mary's Hospital, London,Minutes of the General Medical Council, p. 226. graduating as a Medical Doctor. Returning to Melbourne in 1888, Maloney divided his time between his obstetrics practice and agitating for social reform. It was during this period that he acquired the nickname that he would retain throughout his life, the Little Doctor. Dr Will Maloney, John Peter Russell, 1887 In 1883, Maloney joined two young Australian artists, Tom Roberts and John Peter Russell, on a walking tour of France and Spain. He visited Russell in Paris on several occasions, and in July 1887, on his final visit, Russell painted his portrait in the Impressionist style and gave it to him to take home to Australia. It remained in his possession until his death in 1940, and in 1943 came into the possession of the National Gallery of Victoria. Maloney also kept in touch with Roberts, and purchased one of the panels from the 9 by 5 Impression Exhibition of 1889. Colonial politics Elected to the Victorian colonial Legislative Assembly as the Member for West Melbourne in April 1889, Maloney showed his radical nature by introducing one of the first Bills advocating women's suffrage in the British Empire. He also found the time to establish the Medical Institute, which provided free medical treatment for the poorer denizens of Melbourne. Federal politics Maloney in 1931 Maloney resigned from the Assembly in November 1903 to stand for the Division of Melbourne at the 1903 federal election, narrowly losing to the opposing Protectionist Party candidate Malcolm McEacharn. It was actually his second run for the seat; he had stood as the Labor candidate at the first federal election and was soundly defeated by McEacharn. However, Maloney protested the much narrower 1903 defeat before the Court of Disputed Elections. He contended that hundreds of applications for ballot papers had been attested by ineligible persons, and that postal ballots had been recorded on material other than ordinary ballot papers. In all, at least 240 \\"bad votes\\" had been cast for McEacharn. The Chief Justice ruled that since the votes had been rendered informal through the fault of electoral officers, the only remedy was a new election; had the irregularity been the fault of the voters, he would have declared Maloney the winner. Accordingly, a by-election was run in 1904, which Maloney duly won. Maloney picked up a large swing in his bid for a full term in 1906, and was comfortably returned in subsequent elections as Melbourne became one of Labor's safest seats. He even stood unopposed in 1929 and 1937. Despite his long service, he was never promoted to Cabinet under the four Labor Prime Ministers who served during his tenure‚ÄìChris Watson, Andrew Fisher, Billy Hughes, James Scullin or John Curtin. Indeed, he was never even considered for ministerial preferment, partly because he was reckoned as a political lightweight. He was a Member of Parliament for 36 years without holding ministerial office, the longest period spent as a backbencher by any member of the House of Representatives. In September 1907, Maloney accused Liberal MP John Forrest of attempting to lower the age of consent from 14 to 12 during his time as premier of Western Australia. A heated exchange followed in which Forrest called Maloney a \\"prevaricator\\", \\"scoundrel\\", and a \\"thing\\", while Maloney repeatedly called on Forrest to deny his claims. Forrest subsequently told a reporter that Maloney had misrepresented a debate over the age of consent in which it was eventually agree to raise the age from 10 to 16. According to Forrest's biographer, \\"what was extraordinary about the incident was that Maloney's interjection had nothing whatever to do with the subject then being discussed\\". The issue was revived in 1909 when another Labor MP William Webster drew attention to the fact that the exchange had not been recorded by Hansard, apparently due to an agreement between Maloney, Forrest, Alfred Deakin, and Speaker Sir Frederick Holder. Maloney revived his accusations against Forrest in 1915. Maloney retired before the 1940 election, and died just a month before polling day. He was succeeded by his longtime secretary, future Opposition Leader Arthur Calwell.

Berlin 3033) is an ancient Egyptian text containing five stories about miracles performed by priests and magicians. In the papyrus text, each of these tales are told at the royal court of king Khufu (Cheops) (Fourth Dynasty) by his sons. The story in the papyrus usually is rendered in English as, \\"King Cheops and the Magicians\\"Simpson, William Kelly. (1972).

London: Continuum. . p. 295‚Äì96. In German, into which the text of the Westcar Papyrus was first translated, it is rendered as Die M√§rchen des Papyrus Westcar (\\"the fairy tales of Papyrus Westcar\\"). The surviving material of the Westcar Papyrus consists of twelve columns written in hieratic script. Miriam Lichtheim dates the document to the Hyksos period (eighteenth to sixteenth century BC) and states that it is written in classical Middle Egyptian.M. Lichtheim, Ancient Egyptian Literature, vol.1, University of California Press 1973, p.215 Linguist and Egyptologist thinks it is possible that the Westcar Papyrus was written during the Thirteenth Dynasty. The papyrus has been used by historians as a literary resource for reconstituting the history of the Fourth Dynasty. The papyrus is now on display under low-light conditions in the Egyptian Museum of Berlin.  Discovery story  In 1823 or 1824, British adventurer Henry Westcar apparently discovered the papyrus during travels in Egypt. For unknown reasons he didn't note the exact circumstances under which he obtained the artifact. In 1838 or 1839, German Egyptologist Karl Richard Lepsius claimed to have received the papyrus from Westcar's niece. As Lepsius was able to read some signs of Hieratic, he recognized some of the royal cartouche names of the kings and dated the text to the Old Kingdom. There are inconsistencies about the true nature of the acquisition and the subsequent whereabouts of the Westcar Papyrus. Lepsius writes that the document was on display in the Oxford Bodleian Library, but public exhibitions have been documented there since the early 1860s and Lepsius' name does not appear in any lists or documents. Furthermore, Lepsius never made the text of the Westcar Papyrus public; he stored the papyrus at home in his attic, where it was found after his death. These inconsistencies have led to widespread speculation; many British historians speculate that Lepsius may have stolen the papyrus.Verena M. Lepper: Untersuchungen zu pWestcar. Eine philologische und literaturwissenschaftliche (Neu-)Analyse. √Ñgyptologische Abhandlungen, Band 70. Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 2008, , p. 15‚Äì17. In 1886, German Egyptologist Adolf Erman purchased the papyrus from Lepsius' son and left it to the Museum of Berlin. As the hieratic signs were still insufficiently investigated and translated, the Westcar Papyrus was displayed as some kind of curiosity. Since Erman's first attempt at a complete translation in 1890, the Westcar Papyrus has been translated numerous times, resulting in different outcomes. The dating of the text also varies.Verena M. Lepper: Untersuchungen zu pWestcar. Eine philologische und literaturwissenschaftliche (Neu-)Analyse. √Ñgyptologische Abhandlungen, Band 70. Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 2008, , p. 317‚Äì320..  Material description  Papyrus Westcar is a reused papyrus made of the plant Cyperus papyrus. The scroll of Westcar has been separated into three parts. During the life of Lepsius and Erman it was in two parts; it is not known when and why the scroll was separated into three fragments. The text written on the papyrus includes twelve columns in all. The first part contains on the recto (the front) columns one to three, the second part contains on its recto columns four and five and the third part contains on the verso (the back) columns six to nine and on the recto, the final columns, ten to twelve. The papyrus textile is grainy, of greyish-yellowish colour and very fragile. Part one was fixed onto linen and placed between two glass panes. At five spots the papyrus was fixed to the glass with methyl cellulose. Part two was fixed to a cardboard and wooden plate and is covered by a glass pane. Part three was simply placed between two glass panes and was completely glued to them. The adhesive used for this has partially lost its transparency and a whitish haze has appeared. The edges of all three parts were left free for air circulation. Because of the paper lamination during the eighteenth century, all the papyrus fragments are partially damaged; at several spots the material is torn, distorted, and squashed. Some of the fibres are now lying over the inscription. All of the artifact shows large gaps and the rim of the scrolls is badly frayed. Because of the gaps, many parts of the text are now missing. The text itself is completely written in black iron gall ink and carbon black ink and divided by rubra into ten paragraphs. Between the neatly written sentences red traces of an older text are visible. It looks as if Papyrus Westcar is a palimpsest; the unknown ancient Egyptian author obviously tried but partially failed to wipe the older text off. The clean and calligraphical handwriting shows that the author was a highly educated professional.Verena M. Lepper: Untersuchungen zu pWestcar. Eine philologische und literaturwissenschaftliche (Neu-)Analyse. √Ñgyptologische Abhandlungen, Band 70. Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 2008, , p. 17‚Äì21.  Content  The first story, told by an unknown son of Khufu (possibly Djedefra), is missing everything but the conclusion, in which Khufu orders blessed offerings to king Djoser. It seems to have been a text detailing a miracle performed by a lector priest in the reign of king Djoser, possibly the famous Imhotep.Adolf Erman: Die M√§rchen des Papyrus Westcar I. Einleitung und Commentar. In: Mitteilungen aus den Orientalischen Sammlungen. Heft V, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Berlin 1890. page 10 ‚Äì 12.Verena M. Lepper: Untersuchungen zu pWestcar. Eine philologische und literaturwissenschaftliche (Neu-)Analyse. In: √Ñgyptologische Abhandlungen, Band 70. Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 2008, , pp. 41‚Äì47, 103 & 308‚Äì310..Miriam Lichtheim: Ancient Egyptian literature: a book of readings. The Old and Middle Kingdoms, Band 1. University of California Press 2000, , page 215 ‚Äì 220. The second story, told by Khafra, is set during the reign of one of Khufu's predecessors. King Nebka's chief lector Ubaoner finds that his wife is having a love affair with a townsman of Memphis, and he fashions a crocodile in wax. Upon learning that his unfaithful wife is meeting her lover, he casts a spell for the figurine to come to life upon contact with water, and sets his caretaker to throw it in the stream by which the townsman enters and leaves the lector's estate undiscovered. Upon catching the townsman, the crocodile takes him to the bottom of the lake, where they remain for seven days as the lector entertains the visiting pharaoh. When he tells Nebka the story, and calls the crocodile up again, the king orders the crocodile to devour the townsman once and for all. Then he has the adulterous wife brought forth, set on fire, and thrown in the river. The third story, told by another son named Baufra, is set during the reign of his grandfather Sneferu. The king is bored and his chief lector Djadjaemankh advises him to gather twenty young women and use them to sail him around the palace lake. Sneferu orders twenty beautiful oars made, and gives the women nets to drape around them as they sail. However, one of the girls loses an amulet - a fish pendant made of malachite so dear to her that she will not even accept a substitute from the royal treasury, and until it is returned to her neither she nor any of the other women will row. The king laments this, and the chief lector folds aside the water to allow the retrieval of the amulet, then folds the water back. The fourth story, told by Hordjedef, concerns a miracle set within Khufu's own reign. A townsman named Dedi apparently has the power to reattach a severed head onto an animal, to tame wild lions, and knows the number of secret rooms in the shrine of Thoth. Khufu, intrigued, sends his son to invite this wise man to the court, and upon Dedi's arrival he orders a goose, an undefined waterbird, and a bull beheaded. Dedi reattaches the heads. Khufu then questions him on his knowledge on the shrine of Thoth, and Dedi answers that he does not know the number of rooms, but he knows where they are. When Khufu asks for the wheres and hows, Dedi answers that he is not the one who can give Khufu access, but the first of the three future kings in the womb of the woman Rededjet is. This is a prophecy detailing the beginnings of the Fifth Dynasty, starting with Userkaf. The final story breaks from the format and moves the focus to Rededjet giving birth to her three sons. Upon the day of her children's birth, Ra orders Isis, Nephthys, Meskhenet, Heket, and Khnum to aid her. They disguise themselves as musicians and hurry to Rededjet's house to help her with the difficult birth. The three children are born, each described as strong and healthy, with limbs covered in gold and wearing headdresses of lapis lazuli. The maidservant of Rededjet later has an argument with her mistress, receives a beating and flees, vowing to tell king Khufu what had happened. But on the way, she meets her brother and tells the story to him. Displeased, he beats her, too, and sends her on a path to the water's edge where a crocodile catches her. The brother then goes to see Rededjet, who is crying over the loss of his sister. The brother starts to confess what has happened and at this point the papyrus story ends.  Analysis and interpretations  Papyrus Westcar is of great interest to historians and Egyptologists since it is one of the oldest Egyptian documents that contains such complex text. Unfortunately, the name of the author has been lost. The most recent translations and linguistic investigations by Miriam Lichtheim and Verena Lepper reveal interesting writing and spelling elements hidden in the text of the papyrus, which has led them to a new evaluation of the individual stories. The first story is lost due to damage to the papyrus. The preserved sentences merely reveal the main protagonist of the story, King Djoser. The name of the hero, who is said to have performed the miracle, is completely lost, but Liechtheim and Lepper think it's possible that the Papyrus was talking about the famous architect and high lector priest, Imhotep.  Linguistic stylistics and changing tenses  The second and third stories are written in a conspicuous, flowery, old-fashioned style, and the author has obviously tried to make them sound as if handed down from a long time ago, but fantastic at the same time. He uses quaint phrases and makes the heroes' acting stilted and ceremonious. The first three stories are written in past tense and all the kings are addressed with the salutation \\"justified\\" (Egyptian: maa¬¥-cheru), which was typical in Ancient Egypt when talking about a deceased king. The heroes are addressed in the second and third stories the same way. Curiously, all the kings are addressed with their birth name, notwithstanding that this was unusual in the author's lifetime. While deceased kings were normally called by their birth name, living kings were called by their Horus name. King Khufu is nevertheless called by his birth name in the first three stories, yet in the fourth story, he is treated as being still alive and being the main actor. And even the future kings Userkaf, Sahure, and Neferirkare Kakai are called by their birth names. Verena Lepper thinks, that the reason may be some kind of spelling reform that occurred in the lifetime of the author, perhaps trying to fix the spelling rule for naming a deceased king, in order to show that even the future kings in the story were long since dead during his lifetime. For this reason Verena Lepper doubts that the Westcar stories are based on documents originating from the Old Kingdom.Verena M. Lepper: Untersuchungen zu pWestcar. Eine philologische und literaturwissenschaftliche (Neu-)Analyse. √Ñgyptologische Abhandlungen, Band 70. Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 2008, , page 316‚Äì318. The fourth and fifth stories are written in present tense. The unknown author moves the timeline and also changes his mode of expression from \\"old-fashioned\\" into a contemporary form. He clearly distinguishes \\"long time passed\\" from \\"most recently\\" without cutting the timeline too quickly. The speech of Prince Hordjedef builds the decisive transition: Hordjedef is sick of hearing old, dusty tales that cannot be proven. He explains that a current wonder would be richer in content and more instructive, and so he brings up the story of Dedi. The last section of the fourth story, in which the magician Dedi gives a prophecy to king Khufu, shifts to future tense for a short time, before shifting back to present tense again. This present tense is maintained until the end of the Westcar stories.  Depictions of the kings  Papyrus Westcar contains hidden allusions and puns to the characters of the kings Nebka, Sneferu, and Khufu. An evaluation of the character description of Djoser is impossible due to the great deterioration within his story. In the second story, king Nebka plays the key role. He is depicted as a strict, but lawful judge, who doesn't allow mischief and misbehaviour to occur. The adulterous wife of the story's hero is punished by being burnt alive and her secret lover, revealed thanks to the loyal caretaker, is eaten alive by a summoned crocodile. Caretaker and crocodile are playing the role of justice, whilst king Nebka plays the role of destiny. Lepper and Liechtheim evaluate the depiction of king Nebka as being fairly positive. A strict but lawful king was ideal for the people of the author's lifetime. In the third story king Sneferu becomes a victim of the author's courage to criticize the monarchy. The author depicts Sneferu as a fatuous fool, who is easily pleased with superficial entertainment and who is unable to resolve a dispute with a little rowing maid. Sneferu must go to the extent of having a priest solve the problem. With this narration and embarrassing depiction of a king, the author of Westcar dares to criticise the kings of Egypt as such and makes the third story a sort of satire. Lepper points out that the critiques are hidden cleverly throughout. It is not surprising, since the author had to be careful--the Westcar Papyrus was possibly made available for public entertainment, or at least, for public study. In the fourth story king Khufu is difficult to assess. On one hand he is depicted as ruthless: deciding to have a condemned prisoner decapitated to test the alleged magical powers of the magician Dedi. On the other hand, Khufu is depicted as inquisitive, reasonable and generous: he accepts Dedi's outrage and his offer of an alternative for the prisoner, questions the circumstances and contents of Dedi's prophecy, and rewards the magician generously. The contradictory depiction of Khufu is an object of controversy among Egyptologists and historians to this day. Earlier Egyptologists and historians in particular, such as Adolf Erman, Kurt Heinrich Sethe, and Wolfgang Helck evaluated Khufu's character as heartless and sacrilegious. They lean on the ancient Greek traditions of Herodotus and Diodorus, who described an exaggerated, negative character image of Khufu, ignoring the paradoxical (because positive) traditions the Egyptians always taught. But other Egyptologists such as Dietrich Wildung see Khufu's order as an act of mercy: the prisoner would have received his life back if Dedi had performed his magical trick. Wildung thinks that Dedi's refusal was an allusion to the respect Egyptians showed to human life. The ancient Egyptians were of the opinion that human life should not be misused for dark magic or similar evil things. Lepper and Liechtheim suspect that a difficult-to-assess depiction of Khufu was exactly what the author had planned. He wanted to create a mysterious character.Dietrich Wildung: Die Rolle √§gyptischer K√∂nige im Bewusstsein ihrer Nachwelt. M√ºnchner √§gyptologische Studien 17. Berlin 1969. page 159‚Äì161.Friedrich Lange: Die Geschichten des Herodot, Band 1. S. 188‚Äì190. The fifth and last story tells about the heroine Rededjet (also often read as Ruddedet) and her difficult birth of three sons. The sun god Ra orders his companions Isis, Meskhenet, Hekhet, Nephthys, and Khnum to help Rededjet, to ensure the birth of the triplets and the beginning of a new dynasty. Lepper and Liechtheim both evaluate the story as some kind of narrated moral that deals with the theme of justice and what happens to traitors. Lepper points out, that the story of Rededjet might have been inspired by the historical figure of Khentkaus I, who lived and may have ruled at the end of the Fourth Dynasty. Among the titles discovered to have been given to her is the \\"mother of two kings\\". For a long time it had been thought that she may have borne Userkaf and Sahure, but new evidence shows that Sahure, at least, had a different mother (Queen Neferhetepes). The implication from the Westcar Papyrus that the first three kings of the Fifth Dynasty had been siblings, seems incorrect.Tarek El Awady: The royal family of Sahure. New evidence, in: M. Barta; F. Coppens, J. Krjci (Hrsg.): Abusir and Saqqara in the Year 2005, Prague 2006 , p. 192-98 Since, in the Westcar Papyrus, Rededjet is connected with the role of a future king's mother, the parallels between the biographies of the two ladies has garnered special attention. The role of the maidservant is evaluated as being a key figure for a modern phrasing of indoctrinations about morality and betrayal. The maidservant wants to run her mistress down and is punished by destiny. Destiny is depicted here as a crocodile who snatches the traitor. The whole purpose would be to ensure the beginning of a new dynasty by making the only danger disappear. The author of the Westcar Papyrus artfully creates some kind of happy ending.Verena M. Lepper: Untersuchungen zu pWestcar. Eine philologische und literaturwissenschaftliche (Neu-)Analyse. √Ñgyptologische Abhandlungen, Band 70. Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 2008, , page 121‚Äì123, 146‚Äì148 & 298‚Äì302.  Ending of Papyrus Westcar  Since the first translations of the Westcar Papyrus, historians and Egyptologists have disputed whether the story was finished or unfinished. Earlier evaluations seemed to show an abrupt ending after the death of the traitorous maidservant. But more recently, linguistic investigations made by Verena Lepper and Miriam Liechtheim (especially by Lepper) strengthen the theory that the Westcar text is definitely at an end after the story of the maidservant's death. Lepper points out that the crocodile sequence is repeated several times, like a kind of refrain, which is a typical element in similar stories and documents. Furthermore, Lepper argues that the papyrus has a lot of free space after the apparent ending, enough for another short story.  Influences of Papyrus Westcar in later Egyptian tales  Verena Lepper and Miriam Lichtheim postulate that the tales of Papyrus Westcar inspired later authors to compose and write down similar tales. They refer to multiple, and somewhat later, ancient Egyptian writings in which magicians perform very similar magic tricks and make prophecies to a king. Descriptive examples are the papyri pAthen and The prophecy of Neferti. These novels show the popular theme of prophesying used during the Old Kingdom ‚Äì just as in the story of the Westcar Papyrus. They also both talk about subalterns with magical powers similar to those of Dedi's. The Papyrus pBerlin 3023 contains the story, The Eloquent Peasant, in which the following phrase appears: \\"See, these are artists who create the existing anew, who even replace a severed head\\", which could be interpreted as an allusion to the Westcar Papyrus. pBerlin 3023 contains another reference that strengthens the idea that many ancient Egyptian writings were influenced by the Westcar Papyrus: column 232 contains the phrase \\"sleeping until dawn\\", which appears nearly word-for-word in the Westcar Papyrus. A further descriptive example appears in The prophecy of Neferti. As in the Westcar Papyrus, a subaltern is addressed by a king as \\"my brother\\" and the king is depicted as being accostable and simple-minded. Furthermore, both stories talk about the same king, Sneferu. The Papyrus pAthen contains the phrase: \\"...for these are the wise who can move waters and make a river flow at their mere will and want...\\", which clearly refers to the wonder that the magicians Djadjaemankh and Dedi had performed in the Westcar story. Since pAthen, pBerlin 3023 and The prophecy of Neferti use the same manner of speaking and quaint phrases, complete with numerous allusions to the wonders of Papyrus Westcar, Lepper and Lichtheim hold that Dedi, Ubaoner and Djadjaemankh must have been known to Egyptian authors for a long time.

It was named for Charles I, the then King of England, and was renamed Charles City County in 1637. History During the 17th century, shortly after the establishment of the settlement at Jamestown in 1607, English settlers explored and began settling the areas adjacent to Hampton Roads. On, November 18, 1618, the Virginia Company of London, proprietor of the colony, gave instructions on the formation of a laudable government for the Colony to Sir George Yeardley when he departed from London to become full governor of Virginia. As directed, in 1619, Governor Yeardley established four large corporations, termed citties (sic), which were designated to encompass the developed portion of the colony. These were Kecoughtan (later renamed Elizabeth Cittie), James Cittie, Charles Cittie, and Henrico Cittie. By 1634, by order of Charles I, eight shires were formed with a total population of approximately 5,000 inhabitants. By 1643, these shires had been renamed as counties. Charles City Shire originally extended to both sides of the James River, and Charles City Point on the south side later became known simply as City Point, in an area subdivided to form Prince George County. City Point later became part of the independent city of Hopewell in 1923. In 2005, Charles City County is considered one of only five shires in Virginia still extant, having remained essentially the same political entity as it was when originally formed.

He was named to three Pro Bowls and was a first-team All-Pro during his career, in addition to being a member of the Jets All-Time Four Decade Team. Career Lewis was a star at the University of Georgia, wearing the number 57 as he would in his pro career. Lewis played 200 games as a Jet, the third- longest tenure in franchise history, and was one of the most loved team players and captains of his time. He was a three-time Pro Bowler (1998, 1999, 2000), was the Jets' defensive captain from 1997 to 2003 and was named to the NFL All-Pro team after the 1998 season.

While Lewis would have a productive career, his accomplishments would be overshadowed during a 2001 game against the New England Patriots when he injured the Patriots' starting quarterback Drew Bledsoe. Bledsoe's injury resulted in Tom Brady becoming New England's quarterback, beginning the Brady‚ÄìBelichick era for the Patriots that saw them enjoy nearly two decades of dominance and win six Super Bowl titles. As a result, Lewis' hit on Bledsoe is often noted for its impact on NFL history. The hit appeared on the NFL's list of 100 greatest game changers, ranking at 82.

Football career Wade played college football at Morgan State University. After his collegiate career, he played in the NFL as a defensive back for the Pittsburgh Steelers (1968), the Washington Redskins (1969), and the Denver Broncos (1970). Basketball coaching career Prior to his coaching stint at Maryland, Wade coached at Baltimore's Dunbar High School for ten years, where he compiled a 341-25 record and was often ranked in the nation's top 10. In his best two seasons at the inner-city high school, 1981‚Äì1983, Wade put together teams that produced a 60-0 record, the second of which was ranked first in the nation by USAToday. His 1981-82 team produced four future NBA players - three of them first-round draft picks - including Boston Celtics captain Reggie Lewis, who was the high school's team's sixth man, and 5'-3\\" Tyrone \\"Muggsy\\" Bogues, who had a 14-year NBA career despite being the shortest player in league history. The other two future NBA players were David Wingate and Reggie Williams, who also combined to win an NCAA championship at Georgetown in 1984. Wade was originally hired to replace Lefty Driesell, Maryland's basketball coach of 17 years. Driesell resigned over concerns about the death of All-American forward Len Bias and subsequent revelations about his players' academic performances; the fact that Wade and Driesell didn't like each other, and Wade had consistently said he hadn't wanted Dunbar prospects to play for Driesell at Maryland, was not overlooked by commentators. In high school, Wade had been a strong disciplinarian, and he was appealing to University of Maryland administrators who were attempting to clean up the basketball program. He was also hired in order to increase diversity, as he became the first African American coach of a major sport in the Atlantic Coast Conference, despite the fact that he had no prior experience in coaching a team at the collegiate level. Largely due to the loss of several players suspended after the Len Bias incident, Wade's first season was one of the worst in school history. The Terps suffered their only winless record in ACC play, as part of an overall 9-17 record. Wade quickly rebuilt the team and got the Terps back into the NCAA tournament a year later. Due to the transfer of star players Brian Williams and Steve Hood, the team significantly regressed in 1988-89, losing 20 games, the most in school history. Wade was forced to resign on May 12, 1989 after only three years as head coach, compiling a 36-50 record, including only seven wins in ACC play. His resignation came amid allegations that he broke NCAA rules in dealing with players and recruits. While criticized for his coaching abilities, his ability to recruit was not in question. In only two years of recruiting (he was hired too late for any serious recruiting his first year), Wade landed three NBA first round draft picks in Brian Carson Williams (who later changed his name to Bison Dele), Jerrod Mustaf, and Walt Williams. An investigation found that, among other things, Wade had provided a loan to one of his recruits and provided free clothes to his players. More seriously, Wade lied to the NCAA on several occasions, and even went as far as to hold a meeting with his staff to coordinate plans to lie to the NCAA. In one of the toughest penalties handed out by the NCAA for such transgressions, the Terps were placed on three years' probation, banned from postseason play in 1991 and 1992 and kicked off live television for the 1990-91 season. Their 1988 NCAA Tournament appearance was also scrubbed from the books due to ineligible players. Wade himself was hit with a five-year show-cause order, which effectively blackballed him from the collegiate ranks until 1995.1990 Maryland infraction report Coaching record * 1988 NCAA Tournament appearance was vacated due to ineligible players; official record is 17-12. ^ Record at Maryland is 35-49 (7-35 ACC) without vacated games.

The Bad River Reservation is located on the south shore of Lake Superior and has a land area of in northern Wisconsin straddling Ashland and Iron counties. The tribe has approximately 7,000 members, of whom about 1,800 lived on the reservation during the 2000 census. Most people live in one of four communities: Odanah, Diaperville (also called Old Odanah), Birch Hill, or Frank's Field/Aspen Estates. Odanah, the administrative and cultural center, is located east of the town of Ashland on U.S. Highway 2. New Odanah is also located on the reservation. Over 90% of the reservation is undeveloped land.  History  According to Anishinaabe prophecy, Gichi Manidoo, the Great Spirit, told the Anishinaabe people to move west from the Atlantic coast until they found the \\"food that grows on water.\\" After a series of stops and divisions, the branch of Anishinaabe known as the Lake Superior Chippewa found wild rice near the Chequamegon Bay on the south shore of Lake Superior, at the site of the present-day Bad River Lapointe Reservation. They made their final stopping place at nearby Madeline Island. After the 17th century, Anishinaabe people settled throughout northern Wisconsin into lands formerly disputed with the Dakota Sioux and the Meskwaki. Those that remained near the trading post of La Pointe on Madeline Island were known collectively as the La Pointe Band; they engaged in the fur trade with neighboring French-Canadian settlers. They also pursued other seasonal occupations such as berry-picking, harvesting maple sugar, fishing, ricing, hunting, and gathering nuts, roots and medicinal plants. After a disastrous attempt at removing the Lake Superior Bands in the 19th century, which resulted in the Sandy Lake Tragedy, the U.S. government agreed to set up permanent reservations in Wisconsin. At this point, the La Pointe band split: members who had converted to Roman Catholicism were led by Kechewaishke (Chief Buffalo) and took a reservation at Red Cliff. Those who maintained traditional Midewiwin beliefs settled at Bad River. The two bands, however, maintain close relations to this day. The reservation land was set aside for the Bad River Lapointe Band in the Treaty of La Pointe, made with the United States and signed on Madeline Island on September 30, 1854. The treaty land included almost on Madeline Island, which is considered the center of the Ojibwe Nation. The band is one of six federally recognized tribes in present-day Wisconsin. During the late 19th century, the Franciscan Sisters of Perpetual Adoration set up St. Mary's School in Odanah, an Indian boarding school. Students came from a variety of tribes to learn English and western topics, as well as Christianity. During this period, timber companies on the reservation leased land for lumbering, but they cheated the tribe and destroyed much of the land by overlogging. During the Allotment period, the tribe leased almost half its land base, which originally covered all the area of modern-day Ashland, Wisconsin.  Revival of sovereignty Location of the Bad River Reservation in northern Wisconsin (orange-brown shade) As Lake Superior Ojibwe, the Bad River Lapointe Band retains its rights to hunt, fish, gather wild rice, and medicinal plants over the ceded territory of northern Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota. The tribe pressed these claims throughout the 20th century. Tribal members from Bad River and the other Lake Superior bands resumed their traditional practice of spear fishing, resulting in the Wisconsin Walleye War with recreational and sports fishermen. In 1996, a group of Ojibwe activists known as the Anishinaabe Ogitchida blocked a railroad shipment of sulfuric acid from crossing the reservation; it was destined for a copper mine in Michigan. The protestors complained the acid posed an environmental danger to reservation lands and the Lake Superior watershed. The national attention brought by the protests forced the Environmental Protection Agency to stop the use of acid in the mine. of the reservation are high- quality wetlands due to the Kakagon River and Bad River sloughs, registered by the United States government under the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance. The wetlands are ideal for the cultivation of wild rice, the historical crop of the Ojibwe. The sloughs constitute the only remaining extensive coastal wild rice marsh in the Great Lakes region. Due to its habitat and proximity to Madeline Island, Bad River is of major importance to the Ojibwe Nation. People from all over Ojibwe Country come for the annual August Celebration of the manoomin, or wild rice harvest. The headquarters of the Great Lakes Indian Fish & Wildlife Commission (GLIFWC) is on the Bad River Reservation. The tribe also owns and operates a fish hatchery, which stocks local rivers and lakes with 15 million walleye annually. The Bad River Band Of Lapoint Ojibwe own and operate a casino, as well as the Moccasin Trail gas station and grocery store complex. The Tribe also runs a clinic, local transit, tribal school, daycare, and Head Start, as well as a police and volunteer fire department for its people. It has several community facilities: a tribal fire hall and youth center in the Birch Hill community, and a utility garage in the Franks Field community. In 2014, the Tribe announced it will not renew the lease of 18 non-native people's land lease, on Madeline Island, known as the Amnicon Bay Association. The 50-year lease, which began in 1967, ended in August 2017.  Topography  Bad River Reservation is nearly entirely covered by a forest and swamps. In Anishinaabemowin, they called the Anishinaabe people who lived around swamps Omashkiigowag (\\"Swampy people\\"), from mashkiig meaning \\"swamp\\". The people also go by Mashkigonaabeg, which means \\"Swampy-men:, where the suffix -naabe is \\"male\\" or \\"man\\" in the Anishinaabe language. On the northern border of the Reservation, the elevation tends to be between above sea level. Southwards the elevation increases to between above sea level. Scattered across the reservation are many small lakes.  Climate  Wooded entrance to the reservation Bad River Reservation has extreme climate conditions. Winters are long and cold, while summers are short and warm. The climate is largely affected by Lake Superior. Low temperatures during the cold winter months tend to average slightly above . High temperatures during the cold winter months average above . Average low temperatures during the summer months are near . Average high temperatures during the summer months are between . Precipitation is significant as a result of the extensive forest and Lake Superior. Average yearly precipitation is around .

Early life and education Liskov was born November 7, 1939 in Los Angeles, California, to a Jewish family, the eldest of Jane (n√©e Dickhoff) and Moses Huberman's four children. She earned her BA in mathematics with a minor in physics at the University of California, Berkeley in 1961. In her classes she had one other female classmate, the rest were male. After she graduated she applied to graduate mathematics programs at Berkeley and Princeton. At the time Princeton was not accepting female students in mathematics. She was accepted at Berkeley but instead of studying she moved to Boston and began working at Mitre Corporation. It was there that she became interested in computers and programming. She worked at Mitre for one year before taking a programming job at Harvard where she worked on language translation. She then decided to go back to school and applied again to Berkeley, but also to Stanford and Harvard. In 1968 she became one of the first women in the United States to be awarded a Ph.D from a computer science department when she was awarded her degree from Stanford University. Profile from the National Academies of Engineering. PhDs granted at UW-Madison Computer Sciences Department. At Stanford she worked with John McCarthy and was supported to work in artificial intelligence. The topic of her Ph.D. thesis was a computer program to play chess endgames. Career After graduating from Stanford, Liskov returned to Mitre to work as research staff. Liskov has led many significant projects, including the Venus operating system, a small, low-cost and interactive timesharing system; the design and implementation of CLU; Argus, the first high-level language to support implementation of distributed programs and to demonstrate the technique of promise pipelining; and Thor, an object-oriented database system. With Jeannette Wing, she developed a particular definition of subtyping, commonly known as the Liskov substitution principle. She leads the Programming Methodology Group at MIT, with a current research focus in Byzantine fault tolerance and distributed computing.

The series was broadcast on Fuji TV from April 4, 1974 to May 8, 1975, with a total of 51 episodes. The manga was serialized in Shogakukan's Weekly Sh≈çnen Sunday from April 7, 1974 to August 24, 1975.  Plot  The plot involves three strong-willed teenagers: Ryoma Nagare, Hayato Jin and Musashi Tomoe, who pilot three specially designed combat jets (Eagle, Jaguar, and Bear) which can be combined together into three different giant robots, Getter-1 (balanced and for flight combat), Getter-2 (fast and for ground combat), and Getter-3 (strong and for marine combat). They were assembled by Prof. Saotome, who conceived the Getter Robo project as a means of deep-space exploration. The Getter machine is powered by an energy source known as Getter Rays, which are the invisible manifestation of the pilot's willpower. It became instead Earth's first line of defense against the Dinosaur Empire, a civilization of reptile-like humanoids who evolved from the now-extinct dinosaurs that roamed the earth millions of years ago. They have lived many years underground after being forced to do so by getter ray radiation from space that did not affect the apes who evolved into humans; they now want to reclaim the Earth as theirs and destroy humanity. The series was groundbreaking in the anime mecha genre: for the very first time, it introduced the concept of separate machines combining to form a Super Robot. Using three jets, Getter Robo could combine in three different ways to create three different versions of Getter Robo for different conditions and situations. This idea was originally discussed during the creation process for Mazinger Z (the first Super Robot to be piloted internally), but was dropped and then developed for Getter Robo. This idea of combination and transformation proved to be a very powerful concept that has been used in the super robot genre ever since. Also, by adding three pilots to the robot was able to add an element of teen drama, probably influenced by the already popular anime sci-fi team show Gatchaman (better known in the U.S. as Battle of the Planets, G-Force: Guardians of Space or Eagle Riders).  Sequels and remakes = Getter Robo G  The last episode of the Getter Robo series showed the defeat of the Dinosaur Empire, but with a high price: the death of one of the Getter Robo pilots, Musashi Tomoe. It also introduced a new enemy, the Clan of the 100 Devils, who at that very moment were preparing an invasion of Earth from space. This would be the basis of a sequel with a new, improved version of the original robot, piloted by Ryoma, Hayato, and newcomer pilot Benkei Kuruma. The series, called Getter Robo G, would not be as long and successful as the first one, lasting 39 episodes. The new robot and its pilots were also featured in the Go Nagai short features Great Mazinger vs. Getter Robo G and Grendizer, Getter Robo G, Great Mazinger: Decisive Showdown! Great Sea Beast, despite the fact Getter Robo was conceived as existing in a different universe from the Mazinger/Grendizer continuity. Note: the Getter Robo manga features both the stories of Getter and Getter G. G also became famous in the U.S. as it was included in edited form as part of the Force Five robot series produced for the American market, where its name was changed to Starvengers. These episodes would later be the basis for the direct to video series; Robo Formers. Additionally, toys based on the Getter Robo mecha were licensed by the U.S. toy company Mattel and sold under the company's Shogun Warriors toy line. There was a limited video release of Starvengers in the UK, renamed Formators.  Getter Robo Go  After some years, the franchise was revived in 1991 with the new series Getter Robo Go, directed by Yoshiki Shibata, and featuring a new robot and an all-new team. While originally planned as a remake of Mazinger Z, sponsor Yutaka turned instead to rebooting Getter Robo, with the anime focusing on a new Getter Team, Go Ichimoni, Sho Tachibana and Gai Daido, fighting the forces of Prof. Rando and his Metal Beasts. At the same time, Ishikawa penned a 7 volume Getter Robo Go manga from 1990 to 1993, with a dramatically different plot, albeit sharing several characters. The Go manga continued the story of the original 1970's installments, and later featured the debut of the Shin Getter Robo in its final 3 volumes. Many products were released, such as CDs, toys, video cassettes, and later a DVD set. In addition to that, this was the first time Go Nagai and Toei Animation began working together since the Gaiking incident.http://nagai-again.discutforum.com/t59-anime-getter-robo-go-1991 In the advent of Getter Robo Go's success, the influence and popularity of the original show continued in Japan, and it found a way to stay with fans through video games (like the Super Robot Wars game series, in which the Getter Robo is one of its lineup mainstays) and other merchandise. The series was even spoofed successfully in the mecha anime series Martian Successor Nadesico, where the anime-within-anime Gekiganger III was a direct pun (and homage) to the Getter Robo legacy, among many other super robot series. Gekiganger III was the favorite show of the character Gai in Martian Successor Nadesico. His voice actor, Tomokazu Seki, has also said that Getter Robo is his favorite anime.  Shin Getter Robo  After the ending of Getter Robo Go, Ishikawa, motivated by his editor Nakashima, of Futabasha, decided to extend and explain some topics, like what really happened to Benkei and the Saotome Institute, the reason Ryoma was scared of Getter Rays, what Getter is and such. Also, it featured new insect-like enemies from the far future, later used in Getter Arc. All of this was told in the Getter Robo Go manga prequel, Shin Getter Robo, begun in 1997 and lasted 2 volumes.  Getter Robo Arc  Getter Robo Arc is a 3-volume manga taking place in a science fiction post-apocalyptic futuristic setting. Ryoma's son Takuma joins the human-dinosaur hybrid Kamui and Messiah Tayel's younger brother Baku Yamagishi aboard the Getter Robo Arc, fighting, alongside the Dinosaur Empire, the insect-like enemies of the from the far future. Unfortunately, Super Robot Comics, the magazine in which Arc was published, was canceled and the story ended prematurely.  Getter Robo Hien  In 2007, a new manga entitled Getter Robo Hien: The Earth Suicide was released in Japan. It has since concluded at 3 volumes, and was serialized in a monthly webcomic. This series continues the Ken Ishikawa continuity of Getter manga, temporally taking place after Getter Robo Go and before Getter Arc. The series features an older Hayato leading a new team of Getter Pilots (and a new Getter) as they defend the earth from large plant-like monsters.  Apocrypha Getter Robo DASH  In July 2008 a new manga entitled Apocrypha Getter Robot Dash was released in Japan, in Magazine Z, authored by Hideaki Nishikawa. Due Magazine Z being cancelled, it continues as Apocrypha Getter Robo DARKNESS.  Apocrypha Getter Robo DARKNESS  Apocrypha Getter Robo Darkness is actually Getter Robot DASH, continuing with another title on Young Animal Arashi after Magazine Z was cancelled. The chapter 0 of Getter Robo DARKNESS, published in the July 2009 issue of the magazine, is actually a reprint of the sixth chapter of Getter Robo DASH, the last one published in Magazine Z.  Change!! Getter Robo (Getter Robo Armageddon) The concept was re-invented in 1998 with the retro-styled OVA Change!! Getter Robo: The Last Day of the World (released in America as Getter Robo: Armageddon). Giant Robo director Yasuhiro Imagawa was to direct the OVA, but had a falling out with the studio after Episode 3. The OVA ran 13 episodes and was presented as the sequel to a story - which was never actually animated - about the Getter Team fighting a race of amorphous aliens called \\"Invaders.\\" This production made use of an animation style reminiscent of the old Getter Robo and other 1970s anime shows with thick, sketchy lines.  Shin Getter Robo vs Neo Getter Robo  Two years later, the same staff returned for the four-part OVA Shin Getter Robo vs Neo Getter Robo. The plot of the OVA is loosely based on the original Getter Robo, with the Dinosaur Empire as the antagonists. The OVA introduces a new Getter Robo, the titular Neo Getter Robo, which is similar in design to the Getter Robo from Getter Robo Go and also shares elements of Getter Robo G's design. In addition, it features characters from Getter Robo Go that are closer in personality to those found in the original manga than the anime adaptation. The OVA also included a three part miniseries that lasted five minutes called Dynamic Super Robot's Grand Battle which shows several Go Nagai created robots doing battle with the Mycene empire from the anime Great Mazinger. The short included appearances by Getter Robo G and Shin Getter Robo.  New Getter Robo  In 2004, director Jun Kawagoe produced a new OVA called New Getter Robo, this time being a re-telling of the Getter Robo story. In this new story, humanity is under attack by demonic creatures called Oni. As in the original stories, Dr. Saotome creates a series of Getter-Ray-powered robots to fight the monsters, culminating the creation of Getter Robo. Both the robot and the Getter Team were redesigned for the new series. Getter Robo is more detailed and mechanical-looking than its earlier forms, and all three pilots - Ryoma, Hayato, and a combination of Musashi and Benkei's archetypes named \\"Benkei Musashibo\\" - are as violent and antiheroic as they were in the 70s manga. Ryoma is now an irresponsible street fighter, Hayato a bloodthirsty, sadistic terrorist, and Benkei a hedonistic and gluttonous apprentice monk.  Continuities  The TV series, OVAs and manga are considered to be three different series because of the various differences between them. The TV series Getter Robo and Getter Robo G are Toei's original version based on Go Nagai and Ken Ishikawa's concepts, rather than being adaptions of the manga. Getter Robo Go is a futuristic show that mimics the older TV series in style and family-friendly tone. All three follow a monster- of-the-week formula. The OVAs are mostly based on the Getter Robo manga, and sometimes other Ken Ishikawa manga like Kyomu Senki. Each OVA is set in a different alternate continuity and thus can be watched in any order. The Getter Robo Saga manga compilation by Ken Ishikawa (Getter Robo, Getter Robo G, Getter Robo Go, Shin Getter Robo, Getter Robo Arc) is considered to be the main continuity of the franchise as each entry is connected to each other. The manga not by Ken Ishikawa, like Go Nagai's Devilman vs Getter Robo and Getter Robo Darkness, aren't considered in the Ken Ishikawa continuity.  Video games  The various Getter Robos are mainstay characters in the Super Robot Wars series by Banpresto, usually found in the super deformed style which the series is popular for; Getter appeared in almost every non-original exclusive installment with Gundam and Mazinger (except for Judgement, K, L, UX and BX, in which Getter does not take part). The Getter Robos also received their own turn based strategy game similar to the Super Robot Wars series for the Sony PlayStation titled Getter Robo Daikessen!. This game featured the various versions of Getter Robo from the manga and anime and OVAs produced until that point, as well as an original pink mecha piloted by a trio of ninja women. Shin Getter and Black Getter are included in Another Century's Episode 3, which features the storyline of Getter Robo Armageddon.  Influences  In an interview with Kazuki Nakajima, the writer of Gurren Lagann and chief editor on the Getter Robo Saga compilation, Getter Robo was cited as one of Gurren Laganns main inspiration. Video game company SNK also commented they were influenced by the series when designing the three main characters of The King of Fighters '94. In Powerpuff Girls Z, Dy. Na.Mo, a robot with 3 individual parts that can combine to make various forms similar to Getter Robo appears in episode 50 of the show. In anime parody series All Purpose Cultural Cat Girl Nuku Nuku one episode features Nuku Nuku's creator utilizing a series of robots called \\"Geta Robo\\", shaped like a giant wooden clog (a Geta). He is voiced by Akira Kamiya, who played Ryoma Nagare in Getter Robo. In other anime parody series Lucky Star, any time that they mentioned a dentist, Konata ever remember the Getter II with the drill like a dentist. The Stephen Chow movie, The Mermaid, features a snippet of the theme song in the background at one point. Getter Robo's design, as well as Mazinger Z's design, were both influences for the Japanese super robot Ultra-V in the PlayStation 2 game War of the Monsters. This is very apparent in the mecha's facial design. Additionally Ultra-V's third costume's color palette is very reminiscent of Getter Robo.

Myriad was intended as a neutral, general-purpose typeface that could fulfill a range of uses and have a form easily expandable by computer-aided design to a large range of weights and widths. Myriad is known for its usage by Apple Inc., replacing Apple Garamond as Apple's corporate font from April 29, 2002 to January 24, 2017. Myriad is easily distinguished from other sans-serif fonts due to its \\"y\\" descender (tail) and slanting \\"e\\" cut. Design Myriad is a humanist sans-serif, a relatively informal design taking influences from handwriting. Its letterforms are open rather than \\"folded-up\\" on the nineteenth-century grotesque sans-serif model, and its sloped form is a \\"true italic\\" based on handwriting. The 'g' is single-storey and the 'M' has sloped sides on the model of Roman square capitals. As a family intended for body text and influenced by traditional book printing, text figures are included as well as lining figures at cap height. Twombly described the design process as one of swapping ideas to create a \\"homogenous\\" design but said that in retrospect she found the experience \\"too hard\\" to want to repeat. Myriad is similar to Adrian Frutiger's famous Frutiger typeface, although the italic is a true italic unlike Frutiger's oblique; Frutiger described it as \\"not badly done\\" but felt that the similarities had gone \\"a little too far\\". The later Segoe UI and Corbel are also similar. During the 1990s, Adobe developed a release of Myriad in the multiple master format, an ambitious format intended to allow the user to fine-tune weight, width and other characteristics of the design to their preferred form. The concept was not widely-supported by third-party applications, and so most releases of Myriad have been in the form of separate font files. The concept has since been redeveloped as part of the OpenType variable fonts technology. Variations=Myriad (Type 1) This PostScript Type 1 font family was released after the original Myriad MM. It initially included four fonts in two weights, with complementary italics. All these Type 1 versions supported the ISO-Adobe character set; all were discontinued in the early 2000s. ;Myriad Condensed: It was a condensed version, released around 1998. The condensed fonts comprise three weights, with complementary italics. ;Myriad Headline: A \\"Headline\\" version was also released, which has the weight of Myriad Bold, but slightly narrower. Myriad Web Myriad Web is a version of Myriad in TrueType font format, optimized for onscreen use. It supports Adobe CE and Adobe Western 2 character sets. Myriad Web comprises only five fonts: Myriad Web Pro Bold, Myriad Web Pro Regular, Myriad Web Pro Condensed Italic, Myriad Web Pro Condensed, Myriad Web Pro Italic. Myriad Web Pro is slightly wider than Myriad Pro, while the width of Myriad Web Pro Condensed is between Myriad Pro Condensed and Myriad Pro SemiCondensed. The family is bundled as part of the Adobe Web Type Pro font pack. Myriad Pro Myriad Pro is the OpenType version of the original Myriad font family. It first shipped in 2000, as Adobe moved towards the OpenType standard. Additional designers were Christopher Slye and Fred Brady. Compared to Myriad MM, it added support for Latin Extended, Greek, and Cyrillic characters, as well as oldstyle figures. Myriad Pro originally included thirty fonts in three widths and five weights each, with complementary italics. A \\"semi-condensed\\" width was added in early 2002, expanding the family to forty fonts in four widths and five weights each, with complementary italics. Myriad Pro Regular, Bold, Italic and Bold Italic are bundled with Adobe Reader 7 and 8. In Adobe Reader 9 and onwards, the fonts are included, but not installed in the system fonts directory. Myriad Wild Myriad Wild is an Adobe font package comprising the Myriad Sketch and Myriad Tilt fonts in Type 1 format. Myriad Sketch is a slightly irregular outline version of Myriad, while Myriad Tilt incorporates irregular stroke weight and paths. The family supports ISO-Adobe character set. =Myriad Wild Std= Myriad Wild Std is the OpenType version of Myriad Wild. It supports Adobe Western 2 character set. MyriadCAD MyriadCAD is included in Adobe Reader 9 and is thought to be an implementation of the ANSI CAD lettering. It is also available in the current Adobe Acrobat. Myriad Currency Myriad Currency is included in Adobe Reader 9 and is thought to be the company's embedded font for their currency typefaces. It can be found in the Fonts subfolder of the Resources folder under Adobe Reader 9 from the Program Files folder in the Local Hard Disk Drive. Myriad Arabic Myriad Arabic was designed by Robert Slimbach, with the help of Adobe‚Äôs technical team as well as outside Arabic experts. The principal outside consultant was Dr. Mamoun Sakkal. Five weights of Myriad Arabic (which include Latin-alphabet characters) were licensed by Apple for inclusion with macOS, but must be manually enabled by the user. Myriad Hebrew Myriad Hebrew is an extension of Adobe‚Äôs popular humanist sans-serif typeface Myriad, bringing the sensibility of Myriad into another language and another writing system. Myriad Hebrew is one of the most extensive families of Hebrew typefaces available today, comprising twenty different digital fonts: four weights, each with two italic complements; plus an informal cursive version, also in four weights, with both upright and slanted variants. Myriad Hebrew was designed by Robert Slimbach, with the help of Adobe‚Äôs technical team as well as outside Hebrew experts. The principal outside consultant was Scott-Martin Kosofsky. Myriad Apple Myriad Apple was designed for Apple Inc. to complement the Myriad Pro typeface and allow it to be used as a system font for Apple Inc.'s Macintosh computers that were non-compatible to the lettering format of the Myriad Pro typeface. Myriad Set Pro The Myriad Set Pro font family was first embedded into Apple's corporate website. Myriad Set Pro is available in Bold, Medium, Thin, Text, Semibold and Ultralight weights with corresponding italics, and could be found in most of Apple's websites. Kozuka Gothic Kozuka Gothic is a Japanese typeface, designed as a sans-serif companion to Kozuka Mincho family. The Japanese letters were designed by Masahiko Kozuka and Adobe‚Äôs Japanese type design team. The Latin letters in Kozuka Gothic were adapted from Myriad. Kozuka Gothic Std It is an OpenType version of the Kozuka Gothic font family. Kozuka Gothic Pro (2001) It is a version of Kozuka Gothic with Adobe-Japan1-4 character set support.

The building was constructed between 1952 and 1955 at a cost of $3.3 million ($ in ) and served for nearly 50 years as the home court of the Maryland Terrapins men's and women's basketball teams. A multi- phase, $196 million renovation commenced in 2015 to transform the 14,956-seat basketball arena into a sports and academic complex that includes an indoor practice facility and operations center for the university's football program, a sports science and sports medical research center, and an incubator for entrepreneurs.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/terrapins- insider/wp/2014/11/20/conversion-of-cole-field-house-into-indoor-football- facility-is-approved-by-finance-committee/ Cole Field House Performance Center, the indoor practice facility and operations center for the Maryland Terrapins football team (Big Ten Conference), opened in 2017.

The facility will also be a treatment center for an array of sports injuries. The Center will initially occupy a space within the Cole Field House complex, with plans to expand to a total of 60,000 square feet (5,600 m2) of space. History Cole Field House in 1955 opened as the Student Activities Building, a 12,000-seat basketball arena. The $3.3 million facility was constructed to be the home court of the university's men's basketball team. When it opened, the facility was second-largest basketball arena on the East Coast. Only Madison Square Garden in NYC had a larger seating capacity. The first basketball event hosted in building was played on December 2, 1955, when the Maryland Terrapins beat the Virginia Cavaliers by the score of 67‚Äì55 in an Atlantic Coast Conference regular-season matchup.http://www.umterps.com/ViewArticle.dbml ? The structure was renamed the William P. Cole, Jr. Student Activities Building in 1956 in honor of Judge William P. Cole, Jr., chairman of the university's Board of Regents from 1944 to 1956. The first head men's basketball coach to call the facility home was Bud Millikan. In the late 1960s, then-head coach Lefty Driesell added nearly 3,000 seats around the court raising the hometown decibel level. Cole Field House was the host site of the NCAA Basketball Tournament East Region finals in 1962, when New York University defeated St. John's in the regional final, 94‚Äì85. The NCAA Tournament Final Four was first hosted at the facility in 1966 and featured the Duke Blue Devils, Kentucky Wildcats, Texas Western (now UTEP Miners), and Utah Utes. Texas Western (which started all black players) upset Kentucky's all-white team 72‚Äì65 before 14,253 spectators. Future Hall of Fame head men's basketball coach Gary Williams, then a student, attended the game. Cole Field House also hosted the 1970 NCAA Final Four. In 1991, Cole was the site of the first-ever upset of an NCAA Tournament No. 2-seed at the hands of a No. 15-seed, as Richmond defeated heavily favored Syracuse, 73-69. Cole Field House is the site of the most upsets of No. 1-ranked men's basketball teams. The Terrapins accounted for six of the upsets at Cole, while the other one occurred in the 1966 Final Four where No. 3 Texas Western defeated No. 1 Kentucky. The seventh such occurrence was on February 27, 2002, when Maryland defeated No. 1 Duke. The venues which hosted the second- and third-most No. 1 upsets are Notre Dame's Joyce Athletics & Convention Center (six) and Oklahoma's Lloyd Noble Center (five), respectively.History & Honors, p. 183, 2009 Maryland Basketball Media Guide, 2009. Replacement In the 1990s, the administration at Maryland followed a trend occurring at other schools in the ACC to seek a new facility that provided more seating and amenities than were present at Cole Field House. However, this decision brought some debate. Coach Gary Williams privately wished the team remain at Cole due to the home court advantage he received. The small, cramped arena made Cole Field House a loud and difficult place for opponents to play in.John Feinstein, A March to Madness: A View from the Floor in the Atlantic Coast Conference The last Maryland men's basketball game played at Cole Field House was on March 3, 2002, when Maryland defeated Virginia 112-92\\\\. The team now plays at the XFINITY Center. Overall, 13 men's All-Americans and four women's All-Americans have played at Cole. Maryland men's basketball remained undefeated at Cole during its last season and went on to win the National Championship. Former uses The interior of Cole Field House in 2007. After its basketball teams vacated Cole Field House, the facility was used by the university for intramural athletics and administrative offices. A soccer field constructed atop the basketball court was used as a practice facility by some athletes. The concourse also served as a makeshift track for students, faculty, and other members of the University community. When not used for athletics, the building was used for Homecoming events, classes, and held offices. The structure had been the subject of speculation for renewal and multiple non- University-related reuses. One such plan was to build a station for the future Purple Line, a light rail line in development by the Maryland Transit Administration. The Maryland Maniacs indoor football team used Cole Field House as its home venue in 2010. On September 24, 2013, the Maryland Athletic Department announced that the Terrapin men's and women's basketball teams would hold their Maryland Madness event on October 18 at Cole Field House. It marked the first official athletic event hosted in the facility since the Terps' new arena opened in 2002.

Best continues to tour as a solo act, performing both songs by Slobberbone and The Drams, and songs from his solo record, but also reunites with both bands for shows with full band line-ups. Jess Barr and Brent Best at Dan's Silverleaf in 2005  History  Slobberbone formed in early 1992 in Denton, Texas, where the band played for beer and had their first gig at the Park 'n' Go, a beer store in Denton. The best-known line-up consisted of singer-songwriter Brent Best on guitar and lead vocals, Jess Barr on lead guitar, Brian Lane on bass guitar, and drummer Tony Harper. The band members met after attending University of North Texas, where they lived in a house together and played local shows in Denton. Bassist Brian Lane joined the band in 1996 and guitarist Jess Barr in 1997. They eventually signed with the Austin-based record label, Doolittle Records (which eventually merged with New West Records). Their name is a reference to a dog's chew bone. From 1995 onwards, Slobberbone as a band solidified its lineup and began playing shows outside of Texas, becoming known for its extensive touring schedule across the United States. Jeff Cole from Doolittle Records produced the first two Slobberbone records. Jim Dickinson, who among other work is known for The Replacements, produced Everything You Thought Was Right Was Wrong Today, working with the band to record at Ardent Studios in Memphis, Tennessee. Don Smith of Tommy Stinson's Bash & Pop and Cracker, produced Slippage in Los Angeles, California. In early 2005, the band announced that it was calling it quits because Lane was moving to Florida. Slobberbone played a series of shows for their final farewell tour. In 2009, the band (with the 2005 lineup) reunited for a series of shows. At the end of 2009, the reformed band, with Lane returned to Texas from Florida, announced that they plan on recording a new album in 2010 before going out on another tour. In May 2011, the band's drummer posted a blog entry stating that the planned mini-tour and merchandise sales would help provide the necessary funding for the band's long-anticipated album. Outside of the United States, the band is popular in the Netherlands, where Slobberbone has toured intensively in the main clubs and on festivals since 1998.  The Drams  In 2005, most of the band's members reformed as The Drams when Best was scheduled to play a full band show as a solo act. Two members from Denton, Texas' Budapest One, Keith Killoren and Chad Schlockslager, are members of The Drams. The Drams play rock with the inclusion of background vocals and keyboards. Their record, Jubilee Dive, was produced by Centro-Matic's Matt Pence and came out on mini-major New West Records.  Brent Best  Best was born on September 1, 1970, in Austin, Texas, although his family moved to a nearby small town in Texas shortly after. When he was young he played in a band with his friend, singer-songwriter Kevin Kerby, from his teenage years onwards. They had a two-man band which they described as \\"Black Grass\\" that was called Sad Monkey Railroad. Best was able to co-write with Kerby, and produced the first self-released Slobberbone record with him. In 2015, Best released a solo record called Your Dog, Champ on Last Chance Records. The record which began its start in April 2010, took 5 years to make and was crowd-funded. The record was well received. \\\\- \\\\- Grady Don Sandlin played drums and Ralph White (Bad Livers), Petra Kelly, Scott Danbom (Centro-Matic, Sarah Jaffe) and Claude Bernard (The Gourds) also contributed to the record. Best contributed the song \\"Robert Cole\\" to the Bloodshot Records compilation, Just One More, A Musical Tribute to Larry Brown.  Recognition  Stephen King mentioned the band's song \\"Gimme Back My Dog\\" in his novel Black House. He also listed the song as one of the top three greatest rock and roll songs ever in his column in Entertainment Weekly. Although never publicly confirmed, the album 'Slippage' could very well be Slobberbone's nod to King. The word 'slippage' is an important term in Black House. King Also mentions Slobberbone as a favorite of protagonist Richard Sifkitz in the novella Stationary Bike. Drive-By Truckers front man Patterson Hood sang on the Slobberbone song \\"Lazy Guy\\" on Barrel Chested. Slobberbone often toured with the Drive-By Truckers early in both bands' careers.

It was serialized Monthly Sh≈çnen Jump from 1992 to 2000, in total of 15 volumes. An adaptation of acts 1 and 2 from the first volume of the manga was produced by Toei Animation and released in an original video animation format on December 13, 1996. Plot Angel Densetsu is a story about Seiichir≈ç Kitano, a kind and naive boy with the heart of an angel, but the sinister looks of a devil. This paired with his horrible luck and awkward social skills causes many misunderstandings, leading people to assume that he is a delinquent and heroin addict, and (unbeknownst to himself) results in a career as the head thug, or \\"school guardian\\" at his new school. Characters=Hekikuu High School ; : The main protagonist, a first-year boy whose face inspires terror and despair in other people's hearts, but whose true nature is that of a kind-hearted boy. Despite looking like a delinquent, he keeps his grades up (chapter 57). As of the first chapter, no one but his parents could see his face and not fear in terror. His gentle and caring actions mostly frighten those around him, and while he's used to getting hit for no apparent reason at all (except for his terrifying features), he has a natural ability to move instantly along the direction of the hits thereby suffering little to no damage. He is also observed of having the will to remain standing despite injuries (whether cosmetic or real). :He has slicked back hair, has pale skin, is thin, with black bags under his eyes, no eyebrows, and unnaturally small pupils ‚Äì traits which gives off a demonic delinquent feeling. Since his irises are smaller than normal, he‚Äôs extremely susceptible to sunlight, Especially during summer classes. :Although he has no martial arts skill at all and doesn't like violence, he would often jump into fights head on, either to protect someone or to break the fight. Of course, coming headlong into fights while screaming incoherently (a trait that was also seen in Kitano's father that happens when both are in a state of panic), 'armed' with his already-mentioned scary countenance only serve to confuse the ones he face, and more importantly to serve the rumors of him being a delinquent, especially when the usual circumstances made that he is the only remaining person standing. Because of all the fights he gets caught up in, Kitano's speed and reflexes advance to a near inhuman level, his reflexes are at the level where they can keep up with a martial arts master while his speed is great enough that using he becomes a blur and simultaneously avoid three martial artists (chapters 20, 34, and 51). His speed is fast enough that he can avoid the click of a camera lens of an experienced photographer (chapter 55). :At the beginning of the series when he got into a fight he would stand around getting hit by his opponents avoiding the brunt of the damage using his previously mentioned counter then ending the fight with his trademark double- palmed push. As the series progresses, however, his fighting style switches from constantly getting hit to then avoiding hits with inhuman speed, starting in chapter 20 to 51. :The biggest secret to Kitano‚Äôs strength is his ability to avoid receiving all the blows with the smallest movement necessary. It‚Äôs like the reflexes of Miyamoto Musashi. The sound heard is the attacker hitting him though he‚Äôs not doing any damage. The more them hit him, the more he comes back, so in the end all they feel is fear. :Aside from his speed, reflex, and his stubborn will, Kitano also occasionally uses a special finishing move, a double-palmed push. It is, literally, just a push. Fortunately, or unfortunately, it also bears behind it the whole of Kitano Seiichiro's will. It has been observed repeatedly of having the capability of lifting the victims off their feet and sending them soaring several feet away. This finishing move is instinctual, and mostly used when Kitano is trying to protect someone. An example was when he protected Ryoko against Katayama and his two henchmen in chapter 12. When he saw her getting beat up by Katayama, he pushed the two henchmen unconscious. Katayama tried to keep him down by beating him up, but Kitano kept getting up because Katayama was beating up a girl. Kitano was taught that girls should be treated kindly. He unconsciously turned towards the direction of Katayama's attacks and beats him using his signature push. :Kitano uses hair gel every day in order to prevent his bad bedhead to stick up. On rare days when he runs out of gel or sweat it off, his hair will spike up like a porcupine (chapter 7). Only when his hair is completely wet will it flatten out (chapter 44). :Characteristically of the series, the angel-hearted Kitano would misunderstand the actions of the people he faces (or forced to face), never even thinking ill of them, while the reverse is almost certainly true. This is the running gag that serves as the centre of which the story revolve around. For example, in chapter 14, when Kuroda asked Kitano and Takehisa to help him ‚Äúclean up the trash‚Äù in Soukyuu Park near the school, Kitano told them, ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre going to clean up trash, you use brooms, isn‚Äôt that right?‚Äù Kuroda and Takehisa thought the brooms will be used as weapons to ‚Äúclean up the trash‚Äù (beating up the delinquents from the other schools in Soukyuu Park), while Kitano literally meant for cleaning up the park (picking up and throwing away used soda cans and food into the trash). :In the beginning, everyone feared Kitano. After getting used to him and learning his real personality, they started to view him as a normal person. Even the people who were against him changed for the better. :Kitano confessed to the whole school that he has feelings for Ryoko in chapter 18 after the rumors Suda spread about Kitano and Ryoko going out. After Kuroda took Ryoko away, the students thought less of Kitano‚Äôs cold demeanor though Suda still tries but his reputation crumbled in the end. After the students learn that Kitano is not that mean of a guy, they know that he doesn‚Äôt hurt normal students, only beating the delinquents. :Though Ryoko tries several methods to have him look like a normal person, they end up having the opposite effect. People end up thinking he is immortal. :An amusing fact was revealed in chapter 40, that apparently Kitano and his father can apparently communicate with perfect understanding when both are doing the incoherent screeching that has become one of Kitano's trademarks. Even his sneezes sound like his screeching (chapter 16), though he caught a cold in chapter 20. :Though he looks like a delinquent, surprisingly he comes to school on time every day. Only once in chapter 11 was when he actually skipped school. :A surprising fact, in his last school before he transferred (chapter 21.5), the students and teachers know of his kind nature. The teachers know that he will clean the school on his last day. He coincidentally got arrested instead of the killer and couldn‚Äôt say goodbye to his friends. :He was taught that boys should treat girls kindly. If someone tries to hurt a girl, Kitano‚Äôs willpower returns and will keep attacking until that person is beat (chapter 34). :He is a kind person that, when he visited Ryoko‚Äôs house in chapter 36, he sat in the Seiza position. But when her cold got worse in chapter 37, he felt depressed, which is the only time his personality is different than what it usually is. :When he and Ryoko are together, they are often called the strongest couple. Chapter 41 is the only time when the both of them walked home together without the whole gang. Chapter 52 is where they went on their first date. :With his speed, he is surprising good in football (chapter 57). :Kitano usually takes his classes seriously, except for the time he fell asleep (chapter 65). :Kids have always been afraid of him. There are usually two outcomes. They either run away, or start crying. So he‚Äôs never been good with kids. He doesn‚Äôt know how to talk to them or act towards them (chapter 69). :Ryoko kissed his forehead in chapter 79 and in the lips in chapter 84. ; :First seen in chapter 1, he is the former \\"guardian\\" of Hekikuu High. He's been a slave to the previous guardian for most of his high school life, and he thought he could enjoy being the guardian in his last year of school, but he is forced to resign soon after meeting Kitano. As a third-year student, he is the most delinquent-like of the group, skipping lessons to smoke and provoking fights. Although he usually gets beaten up by others (Koiso Ryoko, Takehisa, other delinquents), he isn't physically weak - he is tall, large by nature, and has considerable strength. The fact he is constantly defeated lies in his mind - he is easily scared and has tendency to panic. When that happens, he will shy away from reality and talk about things like the sky. He is also simple-minded enough to be manipulated, even by Suda in chapter 18, though his two lackeys weren‚Äôt tricked. He considers himself to be number 2 instead of Takehisa. :Kuroda desperately tries to reserve a leftovers of his dignity by acting like a guardian before Ogisu and his senpais. Also, he fell in love with Ryoko in chapter 8 and confessed in chapter 9 but was shot down. She doesn't like to go out with someone weaker than her in both skill and love. He tries to beat her seriously to get her affection but got beaten up instantly instead. Since then, he tries desperately to court her and got manipulated by Suda in the process. :A sample of his real strength is shown in chapter 25. When Ogisu knocked him unconscious after one punch, his fear of his opponent and awkward movements disappeared. He punched Ogisu‚Äôs arm with enough force that he felt the numbing feeling. Unfortunately, that strength was momentarily when Ogisu punched him again, causing him to return to his former weakened nature. :If it is something dealing with Ryoko, like a kiss, he will unconsciously avoid even Takehisa‚Äôs hits (chapter 79). :As third-year students, Jirou Ooshita and Gorou Tokiyama are his two lackeys/friends. Both of them have rarely been referred to by their actual names (Their full names are revealed in chapter 17). Koide, the class president's assistant calls it a \\"miracle\\" that he was able to obtain their full names. As the story progresses, they realize Kuroda's weakness (and strengths, rarely good, though), but they kept on being loyal to him. :Although they act strong, it is usually tough for them just to beat up one person. If they combine 3-vs-1, they can win against a weak delinquent. Once they beat up three delinquents from Hakuun High while running away from Kitano. :Another piece of trivia from the author himself, Kuroda serves as a pivotal character at the very start of the series, when the author experienced a writer's block. ; : He is first seen in chapter 2. He is the strongest first-year delinquent of Hekikuu High, previously suspended for beating up one of the teachers. Short for his size, he makes it up for his strength which he has been known for since middle school. After being defeated by Kitano, he proclaims himself his \\"little brother\\". He sometimes follows Kitano as a lackey. He is considered the number 2, one below Kitano. He sports spiked bleached hair and has no eyebrows. :In the beginning, Kitano thought that Takehisa would commit suicide by slicing his wrist with his knife. In reality, it intimately led to misunderstandings. :He is able to beat up all four delinquents at once if he is gives them the surprise attack and has a weapon. :After claiming loyalty to Kitano, he becomes less delinquent-like. He doesn't get into a lot of fight anymore (although he doesn't lose any of his fighting skill), nor does he skip classes, staying calm most of the time. Before he met Kitano, he used to start fights. His old, hot-blooded self, comes to the surface when someone tries to harm Kitano or himself, like in chapter 45 to 46. :At the end of the series, when confronted with the fact of Kitano being 'normal' - Takehisa's old comrades had come and asked him to join up in order to beat up Kitano - he proclaimed that whether or not Kitano is a delinquent, he is still Takehisa's best friend. He then proceeded to beat up his old comrades with a smile on his face (chapter 81). ; : She is a beautiful first- year student who first appeared in chapter 8. She is the daughter of the Koiso-style kobujutsu karate master, from her father, initially set on fighting each and every high school delinquent, and convinced that Kitano is evil and very strong. After fighting him, however, she discovers his true nature, and little by little she becomes his girlfriend. :In the story, she is considered very strong, having only been beaten by sneak attacks or accidents. Both her and Shirataki Ikuno are observed of having the same personality traits. They, as pointed out by Hirayama, used to be really savage, like they could never stand being beaten by a boy before they met Kitano. But after meeting him, their tenseness ran out of their shoulders, and now they just act normal (chapter 32). :She easily defeats Katayama in chapter 8 but he came back in chapters 10 and 12 for more revenge. :When Kuroda asks her out in chapter 9, she rejects him since she will only go out with a man stronger than her. : She is the first to see Kitano's true kind nature in chapter 11. After Kitano defeats Katayama in chapter 12, she finds out that Kitano is stronger in both power and heart, like an angel. She doesn‚Äôt try to tell people of his true nature because ‚Äúif people always think that what they see is everything, then they don‚Äôt realize they can‚Äôt see what‚Äôs truly important‚Äù (chapter 13). She is the first student (non-delinquent) to talk to Kitano in public. :She is confident to win on a 1-on-1 fight but has trouble with three or more at once, unless it‚Äôs Kuroda and his two lackeys. :She has a suspicion that Suda could not have taken all the delinquents in the Soukyuu Park incident by himself. She knows that Suda couldn‚Äôt have just talked to delinquents and convinced them to leave. Something was up. : While Suda was gather data on her in chapter 17, he learns that her grades are above average. When Koide asked her if she had feelings for Kitano, she reddened as she shook her head in denial. Suda instantly knew that Kitano and her had feelings for each other but hadn‚Äôt realized it yet. :When she was about to confess her feelings to Kitano after he did his in chapter 18, Kuroda cared her away and locked her in the supply closet. When Kuroda lets her out to see his valor, she kicked him. She even went up to Suda and punched him in the face. :She tries several times to get him to become a normal person but all of them failed, like putting bandages on his head in chapter 24. Though, all those ended in vain. :When she stares into the sun, she starts crying. The pigmentation in her irises makes her weak against bright lights. :When Ryoko has a cold, she will have it for a week. Which started out as just Kitano to visit her house with Ikuko, ended up having Kuroda and his two lackeys, Ikuno, Takehisa, and Ogisu visiting as well (chapter 36). :Ryoko was conscious of walking home with Kitano alone without the gang in chapter 41. :Kitano and her went on their first date in chapter 52 and even held hands. :She met Kitano's parents in chapter 64. :She became jealous when Ikuno touched Kitano‚Äôs head in chapter 75 and blood obviously visible on her chest of her uniform. :She kissed Kitano‚Äôs forehead in chapter 79 and in the lips in chapter 84. :Though she can deal with anyone, as long as they have a body, she can‚Äôt deal with them if they don‚Äôt have one (chapter 80). ; : Ryoko's best friend and classmate, and the only \\"normal\\" friend of Kitano, after learning about his true nature from Ryoko in chapter 13. Short for her stature and very sensitive, she's the only one to openly notice how much being friends with Kitano has changed Ryoko and Ikuno (chapter 32). She is annoyed by the slow pace of Ryoko‚Äôs and Kitano‚Äôs relationship since they‚Äôve been going out for six months (chapter 82). :Her name has come to one of the series' running gags, with Kuroda repeatedly calling her Koiso Ryoko's Friend #A. Her first name is first used about one-fourth into the story (starting from chapter 36), and her family is not revealed until the very end of the series (chapter 82). The author had even thrown a contest to let the readers guess the family name (only one reader has correctly guessed what her surname is). :The inspiration for it was Ikuo Hirayama, a famous nihonga artist and former principal of the Geidai. ;Suda : The Hekiku High School Student Body President Suda is handsome, popular, and clever. He is first shown in chapter 15. To him, nothing is more important than the students' view of him and victory over his opponents, and he is willing to go to any length, most often lying to and manipulating his \\"friends and subjects\\" to achieve that goal, such as the Soukyuu Park incident. It was actually Kitano, Kuroda and his two thungs, and Takehisa who cleaned the park of the thugs than the Student Council. :Suda is meant to be a parallel or antithesis to Kitano. While Kitano is frightening in appearance and often called a monster, while actually being kind and gentle, Suda is quite attractive and charismatic, whom people often adore and proclaim to be awesome or hot. However, he is more like a monster in his behavior, often lying to people and manipulating them to achieve his ends. He even goes so far as to try to turn Ryoko against Kitano in order to emotionally devastate him and win the war going on between them at the time (A war Kitano had absolutely no idea even existed, from chapter 16). This fails and Suda is revealed for the demon that he is in front of the whole school in chapter 19, destroying his reputation and his nose (by Ryoko). :He is only seen again in chapter 84 with his reputation obviously ruined. ;Koide :The Vice-President of the Student Body at Hekiku High. He has sworn loyalty to Suda. He knows of Suda‚Äôs evil nature, from chapter 15 when Suda used Soukyuu Park incident as a way to boost his reputation. Suda told him to scoop on Kitano while he didn‚Äôt want to do it himself. He is only seen again in chapter 84 with Suda, whose reputation is completely ruined. ; :He is the first transfer student after Kitano. He is a first-year student who sports a dyed- red hair and naturally large eye-whites. On his first day at Hekikuu High, he thought everyone in the town and the school was pathetic. He wanted to claim the title of guardian at Hekikuu High, conquer it, and then the whole town. :He studied many forms of martial arts, not just brawling. He calls himself the ‚ÄúFighting Master\\". He claims that he never lost a fight in the area where he came from, though he lost to Kojima, Takehisa, Ryoko, and Kitano on his first day at Hekikuu High (chapter 22). The four losses left a serious blow to his self-confidence. :When Ogisu first meets Kitano, Kitano had seen blood on Ogisu (caused by Takahisa and Ryoko) and runs toward him, so he ends up scared and running away. He was sure that Kuroda is Hekikuu's guardian, and that Kitano is the number 2, and Kuroda told him that he could fight him only after he beats Takehisa and Kitano; although Ryoko makes him think that he defeated Kitano once, in the end he gets beaten up once again (chapter 23 to 25). Then he didn‚Äôt show up to class on his first three days of school. He ends up having the same class as Ryoko and Hirayama. :No matter how many times he is crushed, his spectacular willpower brings him back to his feet, burning for revenge. :After meeting Ikuno, he gets beaten up by her several times (chapters 31, 35, and 41).; then, out of humility, he decides to learn the secrets of the Koiso-style kobujutsu and joins the Koiso dojo (chapter 50-52, 57 and after). :At the end of the series, he realizes that he was still a powerful fighter, but was simply overshadowed by Kitano's invincible forces (chapter 84). Then he calls himself Hekikuu High no. 8. :In the end, he's the only one to respect Kuroda, and Kuroda uses him as his subordinate, hoping to use his strength to protect him whenever he's in trouble. ; : First seen in chapter 28, she is the beautiful daughter of Shirataki of the Delinquent Re- educators and heir of his seat. She has been taught by him since a very young age. Her strength is quite satisfactory and will never be threatened or lose her cool because of a frightening countenance. Her beauty, brown hair, and sailor uniform stand out on her first day of transfer. Even though she can get the Hekikuu High uniform, she chose not to. Because of her father‚Äôs work, it is a pain for her to keep buying new uniforms so she chose to stick to her old one (chapter 49). :Her father placed her in the class next to Kitano‚Äôs in the first-year area. When she encounters Kitano, she shook with fear because her internal instincts have acknowledged his strength and the most powerful man she have ever come across. To conquer her fear of Kitano, she attacks any ‚Äústrong‚Äù students, including Ogisu, Kuroda and his two lackeys, and normal students (chapters 31 to 32). :Her mission was to beat up Kitano, but after being defeated by Ryoko (chapter 33), she becomes a part of their group. It is the very first time for her to be able to talk to people normally without anyone fearing her, even after her first days of school at Hekikuu High, when she knocked out a lot of male students. She likes Hekikuu High. Everyone treats her like a normal person, when before she was always feared and shunned. Even though those beatings were never solved, it seems like everyone can tell it was her who did them. And yet they still treat her normally. They are not trying to suck up, they are not afraid. It‚Äôs like she never did anything at all. It was the first for her. At all of the schools she went to before, she was the object of everyone‚Äôs fears. They all avoided her. They pretended like she didn‚Äôt even exist. It was the same with Kitano until the confession. :At first she is cold and uncaring, which is strictly true, but after knowing Kitano, and his gang, she gradually became softer and accepting (results start to show from chapter 49) though her facial expression remains emotionless. But she slightly blushed at the word ‚Äúfriends‚Äù in chapter 72 and smiled in chapter 73. That doesn't mean she isn't ready to fight everyone or anyone at any time. Deep down, she unconsciously beats up the delinquents picking on people, thinking that it was just a slip of the hand (chapter 71). She is still interested in fighting - and later actually ends up fighting - Kitano because of his abilities (chapters 72 to 74). :When Kitano got suspended in chapter 46, she told her father she doesn‚Äôt want to leave, a first for him. :It isn‚Äôt noticeable but she has feelings for Kitano. She confessed in chapter 73 that she loves him. Even Leo stated that she thinks of him as more than a friend (chapter 75). She says once Kitano and Ryoko get married, she'll be his mistress (chapter 82). :After a while, she starts calling Kitano by his first name. :Her father and she moved into the infamous haunted house in chapter 80. What a surprise who the ghost really is. :She also bears a striking resemblance to Clare, the protagonist of Claymore in both personality and physical appearance. =Teachers= ;Principal :He tries any methods to get Kitano out of his school, from the special guidance counselors to suspension, and as far as trying to get him expelled from Hekikuu High. After Kitano's expulsion was lifted in chapter 48, the Principal is never seen messing with Kitano again. ;Shiraishi :Shiraishi is the first person at Hekikuu High who doesn't think of Kitano as a delinquent but as a kind person (even with a face of evil). ;Murakami :The teacher in charge of Ryoko‚Äôs class and the advisor for the karate club. ;Kishida :One of the normal guidance counselors at Hekikuu High. ;Iwata :One of the normal guidance counselors at Hekikuu High. Hakuun High School ;Takeshi Kojima :Kojima is the boss of Hakuun High. He used to practice boxing a long time ago. He has never lost a fist fight, except against Kitano in chapter 6. In chapter 84, he is seen talking to Katayama, acknowledging Kitano‚Äôs fighting skills. ;Hayami :He is Hakuun High's number 2, one level below Kojima. =Teachers= ;Tanabe :The guidance counselor of Hakuun High. Hirin High School The school is smack right in the center of town and whose student body is made up of about 90% delinquents. ;Nakanishi :He is the boss of Hirin High. Because of what happened to Shioda in chapter 81, he fought Kitano in chapter 84 for revenge. Rumors have it that he is way tougher than even Kojima. The scar on his face is supposedly from this one time that he fought a yakuza man-to-man and never steeped down. He got beaten by Kitano‚Äôs double palm strike. ;Katayama :He is as persistent and sneaky as a snake. No matter how hard he is defeated, he will come back the next day for a rematch. He doesn't think of losing a fight a loss. He just thinks the fight still goes on until he wins. He doesn't care how he wins, as long as it is a win. He will use any method possible to defeat his opponents. He will even try to attack them with a pointed rod from behind. If someone starts to mess with him, he won't give them the time of day to rest until he completely crushes them. He was first seen in chapter 8. :When Ryoko beats him in chapter 8, he came back in chapter 9 to get revenge. He doesn't care that she is a girl. But he got defeated again in chapter 10. Unbeknownst to Kitano and Ryoko in chapter 12, Katayama was listening to them. He finds out that Kitano is a fake and injures Ryoko's right leg for another revenge. Kitano uses his willpower to beat him. :He didn‚Äôt participate in the battle against Hekikuu High in chapter 84 because he knows of Kitano‚Äôs fighting abilities. ;Shioda :He was Takehisa‚Äôs senpai in middle school. He asked Takehisa in chapter 81 to help him fight Kitano but in retaliation, got beaten up by Takehisa. Delinquent Re-educators They are known as special guidance counselors, but in truth they are the underside of the Education Committee, pummeling thugs who are beyond saving. Therefore, they are also called the Shadowy Seven, but after Shirataki's defeat/retirement they're now the Shadowy Six. ;Irie :He is the first of the seven guidance counselor seen in chapter 7. He came to Hekikuu High School as an expert in dealing with delinquents. He used to be a delinquent and was called \\"The Tiger of Hekikuu\\". Witnesses saw Kitano push him out the window, though in reality, he didn‚Äôt. Irie left by the end of the chapter. ;Kumagai :He is the most warrior-like of the seven. He is at least tall and wears a karate uniform. He becomes the gym teacher for Kitano‚Äôs class in chapter 20 and tries to kick him unconscious, though Kitano manages to dodge his attacks and beats him. His weakness is that he relies too much on his prowess, the headlong and reckless type. When he uses those incredible moves of his, he can instill terror in his opponents, but when he misses, he actually gives his target a chance to counterattack. He excels in physical size, strength, and fighting sense but if he fought Ikuno, according to her father, she would win. Though he looks like that, he is not entirely young but close to Shirataki‚Äôs age. ;Shirataki :The third special guidance counselor dispatched from the Education Committee to deal with Kitano. He plans to retire because this type of work is not encouraged with old age. Instead, his daughter, Ikuno, will be taking his place. He is supposedly Kumagai‚Äôs equal in fighting. Though he acts nice, he is actually a very cunning and merciless opponent. When the difference in strength is clear, he can seem almost kind in his ways. But against a strong person, he may be forced to show his true personality. He will use any means necessary to crush the enemy when that happens. If he is against a boy like Kitano, who cannot be beaten easily, he will be thoroughly destroyed (chapter 34). After chapter 34, he became a normal counselor. He is a fair fighter who wouldn‚Äôt attack his opponents in their sleep. If he decides to attack, he will come head-on. :He is strong enough that, with the six other special guidance counselors combined, won‚Äôt be any match for him, except against Haruka. :He will destroy anyone who beats Ikuno. It will blemish his honor as a martial artist, otherwise. He is much stronger than her. The only things that bonded them as father and daughter are strength and battle, nothing else. :After his defeat against Kitano in chapter 34, he came back again in chapter 39 for the parent-teacher conference. :As of chapter 42, he became the official Head Guidance Counselor at Hekikuu High. ;Haruka Hishida :First seen in chapter 43, she is the Special Education Committee member who is dispatched to take Shirataki‚Äôs place. She does her work with nothing but absolute pure concern over her students. Even with good intentions and the right actions, she can still cause terrible results. And she has the special ability to always make the other person‚Äôs situation far, far worse than what it used to be. Everything she does for someone ends up backfiring. Whoever she deals with is only going to meet with misfortune. It‚Äôs just in her nature. Shirataki‚Äôs natural enemy. :At first, she tries to rehabilitate Kitano but later finds out about his true nature. Her way of think changed afterwards. She cleared Kitano of his charges and left the school in chapter 48. :She has a poor sense of direction and has no training in martial arts. She is also clumsy and faints at the sign of blood and Kitano. :She is last seen in chapter 84 as the new teacher at Hekikuu High. ;The other three members of the seven/six were never introduced during the series run. Kitano's Parents ; :First seen in chapter 21, Kitano's father is an ordinary office worker, he has slicked back hair, small irises, and non-existent eyebrows much like his son. A key difference with his son is that he is tall, has an extremely large build, and is shown to be extremely muscular. Due to his appearance and his non-understandable shrieking it has led many people to think he is a yakuza. The same if he wears sunglasses because, just like his son, when the sunlight is too strong for his small irises, he will squint. :Behind his fearsome, powerful looks lies a very kind-hearted man. He is a regular old salary man who has trouble flagging down taxis. :In his school days 18 years ago, it is revealed that he too was the unknowing guardian of a high school called the Devil Guardian. Due to his large build and scary face, delinquents thought that he would be good material for their gangs. After finding out that he was a gentle giant, the gangs tried to beat him up only to end up hurting themselves. It was there, on one of those days, that he met Midori, his future wife (chapters 76 to 78). He fell in love with her at first sight. :His fighting style is in an extreme contrast with his son. While Kitano relies on his inhuman speed and reflexes, his father relies on his inhuman endurance. Anything used as a weapon albeit: fist, leg, or wooden sword they end up broken just from striking his body leading him to beat multiple gangs without lifting a finger (chapter 76). However when he did get the will to fight, his fighting style changed from his usual ‚Äústand and take it‚Äù style to a style where he moved at speeds far surpassing his son appearing to everyone around as if he disappeared and reappeared in comparison to his son's 'blur (chapter 78). Also similar to his son, he defeated his opponents with a signature technique, his being instead of a two-handed palm strike a simple slap utilizing his great strength (chapter 78). :He doesn‚Äôt fight back because it hurts to be punched, so he just tries not to feel it. For some reason, people just like to hit and kick him all the time and when they do that, it does hurt. He knows how much it hurts to be punched so he doesn‚Äôt do it to others (chapter 77). ; :She is Kitano's mother. She married Ryuichiro Kitano. Her maiden name is \\"Midori Asai\\" (ÊµÖ‰∫ï„Åø„Å©„Çä). Her appearance is similar to Sadako, but she is actually a very sunny and devoted wife and mother. There is something about her almost frighteningly beautiful looks and gentle personality that connects with Kitano. She is still surrounded with mystery. She is first seen in chapter 21. She is seen again in chapter 63 to 64. She first met Ryuichiro 18 years ago in chapters 76 to 78 and fell in love with him at first sight. She asked him to beat up her cousin, Chuji, to have him come to his senses. She left Chuji for Ryuichiro.  Ryoko‚Äôs Parents ;Heizo Koiso :He is Ryoko‚Äôs father. He taught her the Koiso-style kobujutsu from a very young age. He is seen sparring with her since meeting Kitano but his name wasn‚Äôt revealed until chapter 36. He doesn‚Äôt take in students to learn the Koiso-style kobujutsu. He was initially surprised by the type of friends Ryoko brought home in chapter 36 ‚Äì a bunch of hooligans with no manners or respect. He was initially against a scary guy like Kitano being near Ryoko. He gets really angry when he hasn‚Äôt had breakfast. :He is really tall and has a large frame, plus a moustache and a temper. When he came to watch Ryoko‚Äôs class in elementary school, everyone would scream about yakuza. ;Mrs. Koiso :Ryoko‚Äôs deceased mother. While she was still alive, she used to braid Ryoko‚Äôs hair. The Halford Family ;Papa Halford :It has been 20 years since he moved to Japan. Finally, in chapter 66, this family man has bought himself a home of his own, which is coincidentally across the street from Kitano‚Äôs. He is an American born with a Japanese wife and two kids. But his Japanese is still a bit rusty. Even after 20 years, he still can‚Äôt use chopsticks or read Japanese. ;Mama Halford :Introduced in chapter 66, she is the Japanese woman who married Papa Halford. She is the only one in the family who has black hair. She hides her discontent behind a smile, especially with Papa Halford‚Äôs behavior. ; : Introduced in chapter 66, he is first son of Halford family. He is half-Japanese but can‚Äôt speak English. He is an upbeat, cheerful young boy who loves his sister. He is currently in his last year of middle school. He easily made friends soon after moving. He seriously believes that Kitano is the devil. He fell in love with Ikuno in chapter 72. He asks her to fight Kitano, which she agrees on (chapters 72 to 74). In the end, he gave up. He stated in chapter 75 that he will get stronger enough to protect her. ; : Introduced in chapter 66, she is Leo's little sister. Although she is half- Japanese, she can‚Äôt speak English. She is currently starting middle school. She is afraid of the Devil (Kitano) living across from her new home. What started out as a simple return of money by Kitano, ends up being a chase to a bridge under construction. After falling down a hole, they end up being stuck together for quite some time. Papa Halford ends up getting trapped down there with them (chapters 68 to 70). After spending a long time alone with him, and she ends up discovering his true nature, though she still calls him Devil. Others ;Kiyomi Kaburagi :Introduced in chapter 54, she is the president of the Photography Club at a high school near Hekikuu High. She seeks to capture the theme of ‚Äúevil‚Äù on film, by pursuing Kitano. She will go as far as infiltrating Hekikuu High (chapter 55 to 57) and when he was on his morning jog (chapter 58). She burns with a passion for photographing the highest levels of violence (chapter 59). She used the photo to persuade Ryoko, Hirayama, and Ikuno that Kitano was evil but it backfired (chapter 60) so she went to fight him. Somehow she knew where Kitano would dodge to every time. After spying on him, she learns that he is not really that evil and stops going after him (chapter 62). It is hinted in chapter 62 that she has a small crush for Kitano. She is seen again in chapter 82 and even meets Leo and Sana. ;Kikuchi :He is a member of the Photography Club at the same school as Kaburagi and currently has a crush on her. ;Yamazaki : He is a member of the Photography Club at the same school as Kaburagi. He has a handsome face and knows girls in the schools nearby. ;Noguchi : He is a member of the Photography Club at the same school as Kaburagi. He has a father, a mother, a little sister, and a puppy. ;Chuji Asai :He is only seen 18 years ago in chapters 76 to 78. He is Midori‚Äôs cousin at Sakufu High School. He used to protect Midori when she got picked on. But eventually, he noticed that he never lost those fights and slowly began to get into fights so he could test that strength. Eventually, he controlled the largest high school of thugs in the entire prefecture. All the boys he controlled followed him because they were terrified of his power. He‚Äôs surrounded by all those people, but none of them are his friends. So Midori tries to stay with him and keep him company. But eventually, she disappeared within his heart. Ryuichiro beats him with only one slap.

Hofstetter vs. The Cable Guy  In March 2006, Hofstetter and Razor & Tie announced the April 4 release of Cure for the Cable Guy, a 45-minute CD/DVD that featured a cover with a Larry the Cable Guy Doll hanging by a coax cable. The disc earned Stuff Magazine's \\"Album cover of the month\\". Later that week, Larry the Cable Guy's new film debuted and was universally panned. Several movie reviewers discussed Hofstetter's album, including the Orlando Sentinels Roger Moore. Moore's review was picked up by dozens of papers across the country, including the Chicago Tribune, Denver Post, and Columbus Dispatch. Hofstetter did radio interviews about the album, including one with Philadelphia's Kidd Chris show, where Hofstetter spoke with Larry the Cable Guy's alter ego, Dan Whitney. Whitney ended the interview with his catch phrase, \\"Git-R-Done.\\" The album's cover was compared to the Sex Pistols' \\"Pink Floyd Sucks\\" T-shirts. Allmusic's Bret Love wrote, \\"Hofstetter effectively rebels against the mainstream by positioning himself as the antithesis of the world's most popular comedian. What could be more punk rock than that?\\" In July, an article in the New Yorker quoted Whitney as saying Hofstetter had been hurtful, and Whitney's manager criticizing Hofstetter for \\"trying to make a buck\\". In response, Hofstetter posted a video on YouTube explaining his stance on the Cable Guy and his comedy.

She served on a number of stations during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars and was present at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. Neptune was built during the early years of the war with Revolutionary France and was launched in 1797. She almost immediately became caught up in the events of the mutiny at the Nore, and was one of a few loyal ships tasked with attacking mutinous vessels if they could not be brought to order. The mutiny died out before this became necessary and Neptune joined the Channel Fleet. She moved to the Mediterranean in 1799, spending the rest of the French Revolutionary Wars in operations with Vice-Admiral Lord Keith's fleet. After refitting, and spending time on blockades, she formed part of Lord Nelson's fleet at the Battle of Trafalgar, and was heavily involved in the fighting, sustaining casualties of 10 killed and 34 wounded. She was not fully repaired and returned to service until 1807, when she went out to the Caribbean. In 1809 she participated in the successful invasion of Martinique, and the subsequent battle with Troude's squadron. Returning to Britain towards the end of the wars, she was laid up in ordinary, and in 1813 became a temporary prison ship. She was finally broken up in 1818. Construction and commissioning Neptune was ordered from Deptford Dockyard on 15 February 1790, to a design developed by Surveyor of the Navy Sir John Henslow. She was one of three ships of the Neptune class, alongside her sisters and . Neptune was laid down at Deptford in April 1791, receiving her name on 24 July 1790. The initial stages of her construction were overseen by Master Shipwright Martin Ware, though he was succeeded by Thomas Pollard in June 1795, and Pollard oversaw her completion. Neptune was launched on 28 January 1797 and sailed to Woolwich to be fitted for sea. Arriving at Woolwich on 12 February, she was immediately docked to have her copper sheathing fitted, a process that was completed by 1 March. Launched again, she finished fitting out, and received her masts and yards. Her final costs came to ¬£77,053, and included ¬£61,172 spent on the hull, masts and yards, and a further ¬£15,881 on rigging and stores. She was commissioned on 25 March 1797 under Captain Henry Stanhope, becoming the third ship of the Royal Navy to bear the name Neptune. Her predecessors had been two 90-gun ships, the first launched in 1683, renamed HMS Torbay in 1750 and sold in 1784. The second had been launched in 1757, was used as a sheer hulk from 1784, and was broken up in 1816. Stanhope sailed from Woolwich on 11 June 1797, flying the broad pendant of Commodore Sir Erasmus Gower, and made for the Nore. Mutiny at the Nore Shortly after her arrival at the Nore, Neptune became caught up in the mutiny that had broken out there. While lying at Gravesend, Neptune and the 64-gun ships and , together with a fleet of gunboats, were ordered to intercept and attack the mutinous ships at the Nore. Before they could proceed word came that the mutineers had entered negotiations with the Earl of Northesk, captain of the 64-gun , and by 9 June the mutiny was on the verge of collapse. The attack was called off, and on 21 September Stanhope was superseded by Gower as captain of Neptune. The crisis over, Neptune joined the Channel Fleet. Mediterranean Gower remained in command of Neptune until his promotion to rear-admiral of the white, at which point Herbert Sawyer became her acting-captain. Sawyer was in command until 22 January 1799, and Gower left her on 28 February 1799. Command of the ship formally passed to Captain James Vashon on 5 March 1799. The first half of 1799 was spent with the Channel Fleet, and in June Neptune was one of 15 ships of the line assigned to join Vice-Admiral Lord Keith's fleet in the Mediterranean. The squadron, commanded by Rear-Admiral Sir Charles Cotton, rendezvoused with Keith's force at Menorca on 7 July, bringing the British fleet in the Mediterranean up to 31 ships. Keith intended to intercept a large Franco-Spanish force of 42 ships under Admirals √âtienne Eustache Bruix and Jose Mazarredo, and set out to sea on 10 July. Bruix' expedition evaded Keith, and reached the safety of Brest on 9 August. Neptune went on to spend the rest of the French Revolutionary Wars in the Mediterranean. Vashon was superseded on 26 March 1801, and the following day Captain Edward Brace arrived to take command. Neptune became the flagship of Vice-Admiral James Gambier during this period. Brace's period of command was brief, he was superseded by Captain Francis Austen on 12 September. With the draw down in hostilities prior to the signing of the Treaty of Amiens in March 1802, Neptune was one of the many ships of the Mediterranean fleet to be ordered home, arriving at Portsmouth on 24 February. Austen paid her off on 29 April, but recommissioned her the next day. Neptune then underwent a brief refit, during which ¬£5,728 was expended, ¬£2,895 of which was spent on her hull, masts and yards. Austen was superseded on 30 September 1802 and the following day Captain William O'Bryen Drury took command. With Neptune fully refitted and stored, she sailed from the dockyard and joined the Channel Fleet at Spithead on 29 October. Blockade, and approach to Trafalgar Drury commanded Neptune for the next two years, until his promotion to rear-admiral in 1804. He departed the ship on 13 May 1804, and the following day Captain Sir Thomas Williams took over. Neptune spent the rest of 1804 deployed with the Channel Fleet, blockading the French Atlantic ports. During this time Captain Williams' health progressively worsened, and he was invalided back to Britain on 7 May 1805. He was replaced by Captain Thomas Fremantle on 8 May, and was sent to join Robert Calder's force blockading Ferrol, after the Franco-Spanish fleet had arrived there after the Battle of Cape Finisterre. Calder decided that his eight ships were not sufficient to resist Villeneuve's fleet were it to come out of harbour, and instead went north to join Admiral William Cornwallis's fleet off Brest. Shortly afterwards Nelson's fleet returned from the West Indies, bringing 12 more ships, and Calder was given 18 ships, including Neptune, and sent back to Ferrol to search for Villeneuve. By now Villeneuve had put into Cadiz and Calder's force was ordered to join the hastily assembled British fleet under Vice-Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood, that was blockading the Franco-Spanish fleet at Cadiz. As the British fleet settled in for a long blockade Fremantle commented on Neptunes sailing qualities. She had the reputation of being slow, and Fremantle complained that he did not like being in 'a large ship that don't sail and must continually be late in action.' During the battle however, Midshipman William Baddock commented that 'The old Neptune, which never was a good sailer, took it into her head that morning to sail better than I ever remember to have seen her do before.' Neptune went into the battle 18 men short of her complement. Trafalgar Neptune formed part of the weather column in the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October, and was the third ship from the lead, situated between her sister HMS Temeraire, and the 74-gun . Fremantle had been promised a position second to Nelson aboard , and by 10 o'clock was sailing fast enough to threaten to overtake her. Fremantle hoped to pass her, and lead the line into battle, but Nelson ordered Neptune, take in your studding-sails and drop astern. I shall break the line myself.' Neptune went into action with her band playing, and everyone except the officers and the band lying down on the deck to protect them from enemy fire. Ahead of her Fremantle saw Eliab Harvey's Temeraire turn to pass astern of the French Redoutable, but resolved to follow Nelson and HMS Victory to pass astern of the French flagship Bucentaure. As she passed under Bucentaures stern, Neptune discharged a double-shotted broadside from her larboard (port) guns, with devastating consequences on Villeneuve's already disabled flagship. Fremantle then had the helm swung hard to starboard, bringing his ship abeam of the Bucentaure. He fired two more triple-shotted broadsides from nearly 50 guns at a range of less than 100 yards into the beleaguered French ship.

On Victorys starboard side is the French Redoubtable. Fremantle then spotted the towering mass of the Spanish four-decker Sant√≠sima Trinidad sailing away from him, and steered towards her starboard quarter in the hope of raking her stern. Opening fire with his larboard battery, he positioned Neptune off the Spanish vessel's starboard beam and the two exchanged heavy fire for the next hour as more British ships poured through the gap astern of Neptune. Neptune took fire from other ships of the combined fleet as they sailed past. Sant√≠sima Trinidad, heavily battered by Neptunes guns, as well as those from the 74-gun ships and , became completely dismasted and covered in debris. She fought on until 5.30 pm, when she struck her colours, having sustained casualties of 205 dead and 103 wounded. Neptune left the 98-gun to take possession and headed north to cut off the remains of the enemy fleet, briefly becoming engaged with the French 74-gun Intr√©pide. During the battle Neptune suffered considerable damage to her masts, although they did not fall. Most of her rigging was cut to pieces and she sustained nine shot holes in her hull. She sustained casualties of ten killed and 34 wounded. A remarkably small proportion of her officers became casualties, with only the captain's clerk, Richard Hurrell, being wounded.

After the battle Collingwood transferred his flag from the damaged to the frigate , and on 22 October Neptune took the Royal Sovereign in tow. On 23 October, as the Franco- Spanish forces that had escaped into Cadiz sortied under Commodore Julien Cosmao, Neptune cast off the tow, surrendering the duty to , and took on board Villeneuve and several captured flag captains, who had originally been aboard Mars. As the weather continued to deteriorate Neptune sent her boats to assist in the evacuation of the Sant√≠sima Trinidad before she foundered. After riding out the storm she took the battered Victory, carrying Lord Nelson's body, in tow on 26 October and brought her into Gibraltar on 28 October. West Indies After undergoing some repairs at Gibraltar Neptune sailed to Britain, arriving at Portsmouth on 6 December 1805, where she was paid off. She was moved to Spithead in 1806, but was back in Portsmouth on 23 November, and was moved into a dock on 24 March 1807 to undergo a refit. The refit lasted until November 1807 and involved having her copper sheathing removed and her hull refitted. She was then recoppered, having had a sum of ¬£29,053 expended on her. She was recommissioned on 18 August 1807 under her old commander, Captain Sir Thomas Williams, and was relaunched three days later on 21 August to complete her refit. She was initially assigned to serve in the English Channel, but was moved to the West Indies in 1808. On 9 November Williams was superseded by Captain Thomas Pinto, who only spent six weeks in command before being succeeded by Captain Charles Dilkes on 20 December. In January 1809 an attack on the French colony of Martinique, governed by Admiral Louis Thomas Villaret de Joyeuse, was planned. Neptune became the flagship of the expedition's commander, Rear-Admiral Alexander Cochrane, and the invasion force, consisting of 44 vessels and transports for 10,000 troops under Lieutenant-General George Beckwith, sailed on 28 January. The force arrived at Martinique on 30 January, and 3,000 troops were landed under Major-General Frederick Maitland without resistance. 600 troops were put ashore at Cape Solomon under Major Henderson, both landings supervised by Captain William Charles Fahie aboard the 74-gun . An additional force of 6,500 men were landed in the north of the island under Major-General Sir George Pr√©vost, and the French were driven into several fortified positions, the last of which surrendered on 24 February 1809.

Cochrane's squadron remained in the area blockading the island, and in March a French squadron consisting of three 74-gun ships, Hautpoult, Courageux and Polonais, and two frigates, F√©licit√© and Furieuse, under the overall command of Commodore Amable Troude, arrived in the Caribbean. Finding Martinique in British hands, Troude anchored near √éles des Saintes. There they were blockaded until 14 April, when Cochrane removed this threat. A British force under Major-General Frederick Maitland and Captain Philip Beaver in , landed troops on the islands capturing them. The British then installed heavy guns on vantage points. Threatened, Troude put to sea, chased by Cochrane's squadron. After a running battle over several days the Hautpoult was brought to action and captured. Neptunes captain, Charles Dilkes, was given command of her, while Captain James Athol Wood succeeded him in command of Neptune on 2 August. Neptune was among the naval vessels that shared in the proceeds of the capture of the islands. Final years Dilkes resumed command of Neptune on 2 March 1810, while Wood was exchanged into . Dilkes had apparently been suffering poor health, and Captain N Ballard took command in an acting capacity on 22 July. Neptune returned to Plymouth on 26 October and entered the dock on 9 November to be fitted for the ordinary. The process cost ¬£713, and after undocking on 8 December she was laid up in the Hamoaze until late autumn 1813. Her hull appears to have quickly deteriorated, and after a survey she was deemed unfit for further service at sea. The Navy Board proposed that she be converted into a prison ship, a recommendation the Admiralty accepted, and she was taken in hand for fitting out on 22 November. On the completion of the work in December she was commissioned under Lieutenant George Lawrence. Neptune spent three years in this role, and was finally taken to pieces in October 1818.

SVT is the successor to the SVO division. The current SVT Director is Hermann Salenbauch. SVT was previously led by Hau Thai-Tang (2004‚Äì2007) and John Coletti (1993-2004). Information The group mainly produces specially tuned versions of Ford production vehicles such as the 2010 F-150 SVT Raptor which is based on the Ford F150. However, they do occasionally develop models independently of the rest of the company, namely the GT supercar (developed in conjunction with Saleen). SVT was founded in 1983 by John Plant of Ford Marketing, Janine Bay of Ford Mustang Program Management, and Robert Burnham of Ford Truck Program Management. Originally known as Special Vehicle Operations, SVO developed the 1984‚Äì1986 2.3-liter turbo-charged 4-cylinder Mustang SVO, as well as marketed performance parts through dealer networks (now known as Ford Performance Parts, or FPP). Ford SVT debuted the 2010 F-150 SVT Raptor high-performance off-road truck. The Raptor is the only high-speed off-road performance truck offered by any OEM. Using a completely re-designed suspension, with internal-bypass Fox Racing Shocks and specially developed BF Goodrich all-terrain 35\\" tires, the Raptor is considered an OEM-style \\"pre-runner.\\" Pre-runners are reconnaissance vehicles used for high-speed testing of off-road race courses before a race. F-150 SVT Raptor also debuted the all-new 6.2-liter V8 engine as an option for the 2010 model year (likely to be standard in subsequent model years). Ford reports horsepower and torque as 411 hp (306 kW) @ 5500 rpm, 434 lb¬∑ft (588 N¬∑m) @ 4500 rpm in the Raptor. All Raptor models will have a 6-speed automatic transmission, selectable 4WD, and rear E-Locker that stays engaged at high- speeds. Speculation suggests that as a result of Ford's plan to globalize their vehicles, SVT and the European RS division will merge, thus aligning all American and European performance vehicle activity together.

It was directed by Igor Kovalyov and Norton Virgien and was written by David N. Weiss & J. David Stem. The film introduced Tommy Pickles' baby brother Dil Pickles, who appeared on the series the next year. The film features the voices of E. G. Daily, Tara Strong, Christine Cavanaugh, Kath Soucie, Cheryl Chase, Cree Summer, and Charlie Adler, along with guest stars David Spade, Whoopi Goldberg, Margaret Cho, Busta Rhymes, and Tim Curry. The events of the film take place before the sixth season of Rugrats. Plans for a Rugrats film adaptation, along with Ren and Stimpy and Doug, began when Nickelodeon made a contract with 20th Century Fox to produce films between 1993 and 1995. However, the contract expired with no films into production. Around the same year when the contract expired, development of the film restarted with Paramount Pictures since Nickelodeon's parent company, Viacom, purchased the studio in 1994 and production had restarted on the television series after a small hiatus. The Rugrats Movie was released by Paramount Pictures in the United States on November 20, 1998. The film received generally mixed reviews from critics, but was a box office success, grossing $141 million worldwide. It became the first non-Disney animated film to make over $100 million at the domestic box office.https://www.awn.com/news/rugrats-movie-has-hit-100-million The film is followed by two sequels: Rugrats in Paris in 2000 and Rugrats Go Wild in 2003. Plot Didi Pickles is pregnant with her second baby, which she believes will be a girl while everyone else believes it will be a boy. Didi goes into labor during her baby shower and her friends rush her to the hospital. While this is happening, the kids crawl off and explore a nursery area before being found by the other parents. When the baby is finally born after a montage of past lives, it turns out to be a boy and they name him Dil. Dil quickly becomes a very spoiled and mean baby, crying non-stop for attention, not listening to his mom and dad, keeping all of the toys for himself, and refusing to share with his older brother Tommy. After a nasty fight between Tommy and Dil over Tommy's teddy bear, their father Stu has a conversation with Tommy about being a big brother and the responsibility he now has as such, assuring him that one day he will be happy to have Dil as his little brother. He also gives Tommy a locket with a picture of Tommy and Dil taped together and a watch inside, which he calls his \\"responsibility\\" which Tommy pronounces \\"sponsitility\\". Meanwhile outside of town, a circus train loaded with monkeys stops at a station so the driver and ringmaster can get coffee. While they get coffee, the monkeys hijack the train, and the driver and ringmaster are unsuccessful to stop them. The monkeys accidentally speed up the runaway train causing it to derail and crash into the forest. When Dil pushes the other babies too far, they decide to take him back to the hospital despite Tommy's disapproval, and end up driving recklessly through the streets in a Reptar Wagon which Stu had built for a contest in Japan. Along the way, Dil secretly steals Angelica's Cynthia doll, which prompts her to take the family dog, Spike and they embark on a quest to find the babies and retrieve Cynthia. The babies eventually crashed in the woods, where they realize that they are lost. They spot a ranger's cabin where they believe a \\"lizard\\" (a mispronunciation of wizard) lives and decide to go there, believing that he can take them home. After an encounter with the gang of runaway circus monkeys, Dil is taken away by them. Tommy vows to find Dil by himself, after Chuckie, Phil and Lil agreed they are better off without him. Meanwhile, the parents find out that the babies are missing and try to find them. However, it becomes a media sensation with numerous news reporters constantly asking the adults questions and one of them, the arrogant and insensitive Rex Pester, intentionally infuriates Stu's brother Drew into attacking Stu by telling him he lost Angelica. Tommy eventually finds Dil during a storm, and they are forced to take shelter under a tree. But as Tommy tries to take care of him, Dil selfishly drinks all of the milk and keeps the large blanket for himself, which leads to the blanket tearing in half and Tommy falling into a puddle of mud. Tommy finally snaps and nearly pours banana baby food on Dil for the monkeys to take him away, but Tommy's rage and the storm's lightning and thunder scare Dil so much that he sees the error of his ways. They reconcile and sleep peacefully. After the storm, the other babies find Tommy and Dil, and after running into Angelica and Spike they make their way to the ranger's cabin. While on a bridge, they are confronted by the monkeys but are then scared off by a huge wolf who's been stalking the babies intent on killing them since they arrived in the woods. Spike intervenes and fights the wolf until they both fall from the bridge. Meanwhile, Stu, who has been looking for the babies via a pterodactyl-like aircraft he made, finally finds them, but crash lands into the ranger's cabin. Believing he is the \\"lizard,\\" the babies wish for Spike back instead of going home. Stu falls through the bridge and finds Spike, who actually survived the fall by landing on a strut of the bridge. Soon afterwards, the babies are reunited with their families while the monkeys are reunited with their circus owners. Dil finally learns to share when he drinks half of a bottle of formula and gives the other half to Tommy. The families return home and the babies accept Dil as one of the group after he assists them in getting an ice cream sundae from the top shelf of the refrigerator. Cast=Main * E. G.

The first attempt was in 1993, when Nickelodeon made a two-year contract deal with 20th Century Fox to produce new material, but an unnamed Nickelodeon executive did not rule out the possibility to make films based on their existing properties, one of those that was proposed was Rugrats, alongside Doug and The Ren & Stimpy Show,https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat;=19930607&id;=gldPAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=VAMEAAAAIBAJ&pg;=2074,1837600&hl;=en but the contract expired, with no movies produced (although Doug eventually got a theatrical film from Disney in March 1999). In 1994, Viacom acquired Paramount Pictures, and Paramount would distribute the movies instead, development on the movie started a year later in 1995. Two months before the release of the movie, an episode prequel titled \\"The Family Tree\\" was aired as the final episode of the fifth season. Both the film's beginning and ending parody Paramount and Lucasfilm's Indiana Jones film series. This later inspired the second segment of the episode \\"A Tale of Two Puppies / Okey-Dokey Jones and the Ring of the Sunbeams\\", that aired during the show's eighth season on June 1, 2002. This film was the first Rugrats media to use digital ink and paint, rather than traditional cel animation in the show. Two songs were cut from the film during production. The first revolves around Stu and Didi in a nightmare sequence where Dr. Lipschitz criticizes their parenting through a song. The second depicts the Rugrats pushing the Reptar Wagon through the woods, debating what to do about Dil in an army chant style. These two scenes were cut from the theatrical, VHS, DVD, and Laserdisc releases. However, these scenes are shown on CBS and Nickelodeon television airings of the film. These scenes were also present in the print novelization. The film was released in theaters with a CatDog short titled \\"Fetch\\", in which Cat wins a radio contest, and attempts to answer the phone as Dog chases down his tennis ball. This short was later broadcast in CatDog Episode 21. However, the VHS, DVD and Laserdisc release contains a different CatDog short from Episode 28 titled \\"Winslow's Home Videos\\", in which Winslow shows clips of some of his favorite home videos featuring CatDog's wacky antics. Media=Home video The Rugrats Movie was released on VHS and DVD on March 30, 1999 by Paramount Home Entertainment, which was reprinted many times. Paramount also released the film on Laserdisc. On March 15, 2011, the film was re-released in a three-disc trilogy DVD set alongside its sequels, in honor of Rugrats' 20th anniversary.https://www.amazon.com/Rugrats-Trilogy-Movie-Collection- Elizabeth/dp/B004IK30NC/ref=tmm_dvd_title_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid;=1600366377&sr;=8-1 In addition, it was re-released in some movie sets by Paramount, in 2016 with all the non-sequel Nickelodeon-animated movies up to Barnyard, as well as a separate 2-disc set with Hey Arnold!: The Movie. As of 2020, no Blu-ray release has been announced. Soundtrack The Rugrats Movie: Music From the Motion Picture was released on November 3, 1998. The enhanced soundtrack contained thirteen tracks, bonus CD-ROM demos and commercials. Amazon.com's Richard Gehr praised the CD for \\"[bridging] demographics as nimbly as the [original] show itself [did]\\" and for songs \\"fans of all ages will love\\". Entertainment Weeklys David Browne rated the Music From the Motion Picture with a C. Browne noted that, while the soundtrack is enjoyable for children and does \\"[make] concessions\\" for parents, adults may dislike the amount of rap. Allmusic's William Ruhlmann reviewed the soundtrack positively, saying \\"the result\\" of the singers and songs \\"is a romp in keeping with the tone of the show and the film\\". The Rugrats Movie: Music from the Motion Picture spent twenty six weeks on Billboard 200, peaking at #19. One song written for the film's soundtrack that was ultimately removed was \\"(Safe in This) Sky Life\\", a new track by English rock musician David Bowie; the song marked a reunion with longtime collaborator Tony Visconti, who would go on to produce all of Bowie's material from 2002 up until his death in 2016.

It was developed by Software Creations and released by THQ. Br√∏derbund also developed and published a computer game based on the film, titled The Rugrats Movie: Activity Challenge. It was released in September 1998, as part of the film's marketing campaign. Books Several books were released by Simon & Schuster's Simon Spotlight branch and Nickelodeon inspired by The Rugrats Movie. Tommy's New Playmate and The Rugrats Versus the Monkeys were also released on October 1, 1998, authored by Luke David and illustrated by John Kurtz and Sandrina Kurtz. The Rugrats Movie Storybook, released on the same date and using the same illustrators and publishers, was written by Sarah Wilson. The same date saw the release of The Rugrats Movie: Hang On To Your Diapies, Babies, We're Going In!: Trivia from the Hit Movie!, a trivia book written by Kitty Richards. A novelization of the film written by Cathy East Dubowski was published on October 1, 1998, by Tandem Library. The following month, a 144-page guidebook, The Making of The Rugrats Movie: Behind the Scenes at Klasky Csupo, was released on November 1, 1998, by MSG. In May 1999, Hal Leonard Publishing Corporation released a book titled The Rugrats Movie. Reception=Box office The film was released on November 20, 1998, and made US$27,321,470 in its opening weekend, from 2,782 theaters, averaging about $9,821 per venue and ranking as the #1 movie that weekend, beating out Enemy of the State. In total, The Rugrats Movie made US$140,894,675, $100,494,675 from the domestic market, and $40,400,000 from its foreign release. The film was released in the United Kingdom on March 26, 1999, and topped the country's box office for the next three weekends, before being dethroned by The Faculty. Critical reception The Rugrats Movie holds a 59% rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on 51 reviews (30 positive and 21 negative), with an average rating of 5.8/10. The consensus is: \\"Charming characters; loads of fun for kids and adults.\\" Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four. Ebert wrote that the film's target audience was primarily younger children, and that, while he as an adult disliked it, he \\"might have\\" liked it if he were younger and would recommend it for children. The New York Timess Anita Gates reviewed The Rugrats Movie positively, calling it a \\"delight\\". Neil Jeffries of Empire gave the film three out of five stars, saying, \\"Fun for kids, but, despite some adult references, appeal for the over 10s is limited.\\" Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly graded the film with a B. Schwarzbaum praised the movie for its appeal to both adult and child audiences, \\"juxtaposing the blithely self-absorbed parallel universes of small, diapered children and their large, Dockered parents\\". However, other Entertainment Weekly reviewer Ty Burr gave The Rugrats Movie a B‚àí, criticizing that the film's issues sprung from it being \\"bigger\\" than the original series, thus it having more cultural references, out-of-place CGI scenes, and \\"[going] into scary territory\\". Despite these faults, Burr did praise the \\"escaped circus monkeys\\" for being \\"scary in a good way\\", as well as a joke that was accessible to younger audiences. Rugrats co-creator Paul Germain (who was showrunner for the first three seasons before leaving to work for Disney) did not like the film's story. Germain felt that the writers of the movie did not understand what the series was about, and thought that moments such as Stu giving a watch to Tommy did not work as the babies and adults were not supposed to communicate. In addition, he felt that by giving Tommy a baby brother, Tommy was no longer the baby, thus the story of the series was changed from what it was supposed to be.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms39Ck6EcGM Sequels Two sequels have been released: Rugrats in Paris: The Movie, which was released on November 17, 2000, and Rugrats Go Wild, which was released on June 13, 2003.

The Gershonites were charged with the care of the outer tabernacle including components such as the tent and its covering, screens, doors, and hangings. Biblical scholars regard the name as being essentially the same as \\"Gershom\\" (),Cheyne and Black, Encyclopedia Biblica which appears to mean \\"a sojourner there\\" (◊í◊® ◊©◊ù), and it is Gershom rather than Gershon who is sometimes listed in the Book of Chronicles as a founder of one of the principal Levite factions. The Torah names Gershon's sons as Libni and Shimei. Textual scholars attribute the genealogy to the Book of Generations, a document originating from a religiopolitical group similar to that behind the Priestly source, and at a similar date.Richard Elliott Friedman, Who Wrote the Bible? According to some biblical scholars, the Torah's genealogy for Levi's descendants is actually an aetiological myth reflecting the fact that there were four different groups among the Levites ‚Äî the Gershonites, the Kohathites, the Merarites, and the Aaronids.

He was elected as a representative for Battambang Province in the 1998 National Elections, then again for Kompong Cham province in 2003.  2005 arrest  On 3 February 2005, a vote in the Cambodian National Assembly removed the parliamentary immunity from Cheam, fellow MP Chea Poch and party leader Sam Rainsy. Rainsy and Poch, both facing possible charges of criminal defamation, left the country. Cheam did not leave and was arrested later the same day by military police. He was charged by the Cambodian Military Court with the criminal offences of Organised Crime and Fraud, as well as a military charge of disobeying orders. These charges relate to accusations that Cheam had created an illegal army for the SRP. Cheam appealed by letter to Prince Norodom Ranariddh, but the prince responded that he could not intervene in judicial matters. Cheam was brought to trial on 8 August 2005, after courts exhausted the maximum six months allowed by Cambodian law for pre-trial detention. In his defense, Cheam stated, \\"I have never recruited or appointed anyone in an army structure, nor have I taken money from anyone ... I am pleading with the court to set me free. I have never done anything even close to what the charges against me say.\\" The prosecutor argued that Cheam's actions had endangered national security. The following day, the Military Court sentenced Cheam to 7 years imprisonment. Amnesty International criticized the trial, stating that it \\"fell far short of international standards for fairness and failed to produce any evidence to corroborate the charges against him\\".  International response  The arrest and detention of Cheam met with widespread international condemnation. Peter Leuprecht, the special representative of the United Nations Secretary-General for human rights in Cambodia, called the trial unfair and called for Cheam's release. The U.S. State Department listed the case in a report on \\"Arbitrary Arrest or Detention\\" and noted that \\"international and local NGOs widely criticized Cheam Channy's arrest and detention as illegal under criminal law\\". Amnesty International declared him to be a prisoner of conscience. Human Rights Watch described the charges against Cheam and other parliamentarians as \\"a thinly-veiled effort by Cambodia's ruling parties to eliminate their political opponents\\", and objected to the use of a military court to try a civilian. On 1 February 2006, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on the Cambodian government to unconditionally release him. The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention declared Cheam's imprisonment \\"arbitrary\\" and \\"in contravention of article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights\\".  Royal pardon  On 2 February 2006, King Norodom Sihamoni reduced Cheam's sentence from seven years' imprisonment to three years. Four days later, Cheam received a full royal pardon, and was released from prison. The U.S. State Department praised the pardon, calling it a \\"positive turn\\".  Death  Cheam died on 25 October 2018. He had been suffering from a brain tumour that had subsequently spread to his intestines.

As a child, he delivered lectures on temperance and on Sunday schools before he was fourteen years old. He graduated from Dickinson College in 1839. Career Deems taught and preached in New York City for a few months, and in 1840 took charge of the Methodist Episcopal church at Asbury, New Jersey, and removed in the next year to North Carolina, where he was General Agent for the American Bible Society. Deems was professor of logic and rhetoric at the University of North Carolina from 1842 to 1847, and professor of natural sciences at Randolph Macon College (then at Boydton, Virginia) in 1847‚Äì1848, and after two years of preaching at New Bern, North Carolina, he held for four years (1850‚Äì1854) the presidency of Greensboro, N.

Open E major chord, E major barre chord, then open E major chord. In music, a barre chord (also spelled bar chord or, rarely, barr chord) is a type of chord on a guitar or other stringed instrument, that the musician plays by using one or more fingers to press down multiple strings across a single fret of the fingerboard (like a bar pressing down the strings). Players often use this chording technique to play a chord that is not restricted by the tones of the guitar's open strings. For instance, if a guitar is tuned to regular concert pitch, with the open strings being E, A, D, G, B, E (from low to high), open chords must be based on one or more of these notes. To play an F chord the guitarist may barre strings so that the chord root is F. Most barre chords are \\"moveable\\" chords, as the player can move the whole chord shape up and down the neck.Moore, Allan. \\"The So-Called 'Flattened Seventh' in Rock\\", p.200n17, Popular Music, Vol. 14, No. 2. (May, 1995), pp. 185-201. Commonly used in both popular and classical music, Barre chords are frequently used in combination with \\"open\\" chords, where the guitar's open (unfretted) strings construct the chord. Playing a chord with the barre technique slightly affects tone quality. A closed, or fretted, note sounds slightly different from an open, unfretted, string. Barre chords are a distinctive part of the sound of pop music and rock music. Using the barre technique, the guitarist can fret a familiar open chord shape, and then transpose, or raise, the chord a number of half-steps higher, similar to the use of a capo. For example, the current chord is an E major and the next is an F major, the guitarist barres the open E major up two frets (two semitones) from the open position to produce a barred F major chord. Such chords are hard to play for beginners due to the pressing of multiple strings with a single finger.  Etymology  The term barre comes from the method of using the index finger to form a rigid \\"bar\\" across the strings. The original spelling \\"barr√©\\" is French, translating to \\"barred\\".  Technique and application  The index finger locates the root note in the chord shape. * Note: notes of each chord are listed from bottom, thickest string (lowest in pitch) string to top (a standard six-string tuning of EADGBE, from lowest to highest-pitched string). D/C barre chord (left), difficult to reach in open position (right). Guitarists typically use barre chords to voice chords in higher positions. Keys that don't have many open notes in standard tuning (hence few or no open chord fingerings) require many barre chords. The two most commonly barred notes are variations on the fingering shapes of A and E in first (open) position. The E-type barre chord is an E chord shape (022100) barred up and down the frets, transposing the chord. For example, the E chord barred one fret up becomes an F chord (133211). The next fret up is F, followed by G, A, A, B, B, C, C, D, E, and then back to E (1 octave up) at fret twelve. E A E-------------0 ---------------5--- B-------------0---------------5--- G-------------1 ---------------6--- D-------------2---------------7--- A-------------2 ---------------7--- E-------------0---------------5--- Guitar tablature of an open E chord and an E-shape A barre chord. The \\"A\\" type barre chord, occasionally called the double barre, is the A chord shape (X02220) moved up and down the frets. To barre the A chord shape, the guitars puts the index finger across the top five strings, usually touching the 6th string (E) to mute it. They then barre either the ring or little finger across the 2nd (B), 3rd (G), and 4th (D) strings two frets down, or one finger frets each string. For instance, Barred at the second fret, the A chord becomes B (X24442). From fret one to twelve, the barred A becomes B, B, C, C, D, E, E, F, F, G, A, and at the twelfth fret (that is, one octave up), it is A again. A D E -------------0---------------5--- B-------------2---------------7--- G -------------2---------------7--- D-------------2---------------7--- A -------------0---------------5--- E--------------------------------- Guitar tablature of an open A chord and an A-shape D barre chord. Sometimes the guitarist leaves out the highest note in a double barre chord. Most variations of these two chords can be barred: dominant 7ths, minors, minor 7ths, etc. Minor barre chords include a minor third in the chord rather than the major third (in \\"E\\" and \\"A\\" shaped barre chords, this note happens to be the highest 'non-barred' note). Example: F Fm C Cm E--------1--------1--------3------- 3------- B--------1--------1--------5-------4------- G--------2--------1 --------5-------5------- D--------3--------3--------5-------5------- A-------- 3--------3--------3-------3------- E--------1--------1------------------------ In addition to the two common shapes above, barre/movable chords can also be built on any chord fingering, provided that the shape leaves the first finger free to create the barre, and that the chord does not require the fingers to extend beyond a four fret range. Examples: D A E--------2--------5----- B --------3--------2----- G--------2--------2----- D--------4--------2----- A --------5--------4----- E-----------------5----- The above shows D major in open \\"C\\" shape form and A major in open \\"G\\" shape form. In the example above, the \\"C\\" shape offers an alternative voicing to the open D major and to the \\"A\\" shaped D major in fifth position. Variations of the basic major and minor triad chords can also be formed using the barred chord as their foundation. For example, the open Cadd9 shape can be used in its C shape barre form up the guitar neck, as desired. CAGED System The CAGED system is an acronym for the chords C, A, G, E, and D. This acronym is shorthand for the use of barre chords that can be played anywhere on the fret board as described above. Some guitar instructors use it to teach students the open chords that can work as barre chords across the fret board. By replacing the nut with a full barre, a player can use the chord shapes for C, A, G, E, and D anywhere on the fret board to play any major chord in any key. This system also provides a way to remember scale shapes, though some debate the usefulness of this teaching method due to potential technical problems. Use in popular music VII-I cadence in C major. The use of the leading-tone imperfect authentic cadence (VII-I) in popular music is often attributed to the ease of sliding a barre chord up two frets.Authentic cadence In the context of classical music, Fernando Sor recommends using barring and shifting sparingly. His principal reason for avoiding barre chords is that they require more effort‚Äîbut he acknowledges that they are frequently the best or only solution for playing some passages.Ryan, Lee F. (1991).

The small bar or regular F chord is easily obtainable, but \\"Being able to play the Small Bar chord formations does little towards developing the technique required to play the Great Bar chord formations.\\" Gm Gm Gm Gm7 E------3------3------3------ 3------ B------3------3------3------3------ G------3------3------3------ 3------ D------5------5-------------3------ A------ 5--------------------------- E------3--------------------------- E-shape Gm 'great', 'small', \\"simplified version\\", and Em7-shape Gm7 'small' chords. The 'simplified version' on the upper three strings is \\"useful in playing solos,\\" and may be played with any of the first three fingers. The minor seventh chord whose root is located on the first may instead be considered an added sixth chord whose root is located on the third string, in which case one may consider the Gm7 a Badd6.  Diagonal barre chord  Diagonal barre chord: major seventh chord on G.Latarski, Don (1999). Ultimate Guitar Chords: First Chords, p.5. . The first finger frets both the second fret on the first four strings and the third fret on the sixth string. A diagonal barre chord is a \\"very rare chord\\" involving \\"the barring of a couple of strings with the first finger [diagonally] on different frets.\\"  Notation  Standard music notation indicates the barre technique with one of two letters, \\"B\\" or \\"C\\"‚Äîfollowed by a positional indication via an Arabic number or Roman numeral. Examples: BIII, CVII, B2, C7. The two abbreviations \\"B\\", \\"C\\", represent the terms barre or bar, cejillo or capotasto, the later being Spanish and Italian terms for capo. The choice of letter is an editorial decision that reflects the style adopted. Roman numerals are more prevalent than Arabic numbers to avoid confusion with other fingering indications and common chord symbols (but not figured harmony). Roman numerals without the \\"B\\" or \\"C\\" indicates fingerboard position only. Editorial style also affects partial barre indications. A vertical strike-through of the letter \\"C\\" commonly indicates a partial barre‚Äîthe number of strings to barre depends on context and performer choice. Other editorial styles use superscript fractions (e.g., 4/6, 1/2) indicates the number of strings to barre in addition to the letters B or C. In some notation styles (particularly classical staff notation), the letters \\"B\\" or \\"C\\" are omitted altogether, with the number of courses to barre (from the highest-tuned downwards) written as an index (superscript). For example: on a guitar, VII4 indicates a barre on the 7th fret over the highest four strings (D, G, B, and E). There is no rule for whether to write full barre chords with indices (e.g., \\"6\\" for a standard guitar) or without. It is a matter of the editors personal taste. It is customary to place the barre sign above the staff, with a spanning line to mark duration. The barre is often signed on tablature as \\"C\\" with the fret number as Roman numeral, such as CVII CVIII CXII CII E--------7--------8--------13-------2------- B--------9--------8 --------15-------4------- G--------9--------8--------14-------2------- D --------9--------10-------12-------4------- A--------7--------10-------12 -------2------- E--------7--------8--------12-------2------- E Cm Dm B7 Barre chord notation in classical music uses Roman numerals with indices (see left).

Early career  Knight was born on April 9, 1943 in Lapeer, Michigan. After graduating from high school in 1961, he briefly attended Alma College before dropping out. Knight's music career began as a Detroit DJ in 1963 when he replaced Dave Shafer as \\"Jack the Bellboy\\" on WJBK, coming to Detroit from Flint, Michigan's Top 40 rock station WTAC. The following year, he moved across the river to CKLW in Windsor, Ontario. Arguably the first American DJ to air the Rolling Stones, he hosted a late night show from high-powered CKLW, bringing the British Invasion to the Northern states. He was awarded the honorary title of \\"The Sixth Stone\\" for his early support of the Stones. By the end of 1964, however, Knight had left CKLW and the radio business, intending to pursue his own career in music. Around 1965, Knight fashioned his own songwriting and performing career in Flint by becoming the front man for Terry Knight and the Pack. With this band, Knight recorded a handful of regional hits for local Lucky Eleven Records, part of the Cameo-Parkway Records group, including his self-penned generation gap anthem \\"A Change On the Way\\", as well as scoring two national hits, a tasteful cover of the Yardbirds' \\"(You're a) Better Man Than I\\" and his ultra- lounge reading of Ben E. King's \\"I (Who Have Nothing)\\" (which came close to making the national top 40, peaking at #46). The band also left behind three long-playing garage classics before breaking up in 1967. (Brownsville Station honored Knight and the Pack with a cover of the Knight-penned \\"Love, Love, Love, Love, Love\\" on their '73 album Yeah!)  Producer and solo career  In 1967 Knight moved to New York, and attempted a solo career as a singer and staff producer with the Cameo-Parkway label, with limited success. He produced and wrote a handful of tracks by other artists, including garage band Question Mark & the Mysterians and the easy-listening International Pop Orchestra. He also scored music for the 20th Century Fox noir film The Incident (1967). Knight traveled to London in 1968, hoping to become a recording artist or producer for the Beatles' newly formed Apple Records. Knight met Paul McCartney and was present at some of the recording sessions for the band's 1968 double album The Beatles (also known as the \\"White Album\\"), including the session when Ringo Starr temporarily quit the group. Knight was surprised to find the band members arguing with each other. He soon left London after he was unable to negotiate a contract with acceptable terms.\\"Terry Knight Refuses Apple but Still Comes out on Top\\", Detroit Free Press (May 2, 1969), p. 5C.  \\"Saint Paul\\"  In early 1969 Knight secured a producer's contract with Capitol Records which also allowed him to release his own songs as a solo artist. He wrote and recorded a single, \\"Saint Paul\\", which may have contributed to the \\"Paul is dead\\" hoax that erupted late in the year. The cryptic lyrics of the song are generally thought to allude to Knight's failed relationship with McCartney and his apparent belief that the Beatles would soon break up. The lyrics do not refer to death but were interpreted by some fans as containing clues. The ending repeats the phrase \\"hey Paul\\" in an arrangement that sounds similar to the Beatles' song \\"Hey Jude\\". There are two versions, both in stereo. The full five-minute version contains a high-pitched voice singing lines from Beatles songs, including \\"Hello, Goodbye\\", \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" and \\"She Loves You\\", while the four- minute edit does not contain additional song excerpts. Initial copies of the single listed Knight's company Storybook Music as the publisher of \\"Saint Paul\\". After Capitol received a cease and desist letter from the Beatles' music publisher, Maclen Music (the U.S. division of Northern Songs), the record was pulled from distribution. A deal was then worked out between Knight and Maclen Music. About a month later, in May 1969, \\"Saint Paul\\" was reissued with a publishing credit by Maclen. TV program produced by Netherlands Film and Television Academy The second pressing of the record also contained a note on the label that stated that \\"Hey Jude\\" was \\"used by permission\\". The reassignment of the publishing rights made Knights' song the only non Lennon‚ÄìMcCartney tune owned by Maclen. \\"Saint Paul\\" reached the top 40 in some cities in the upper Midwest region but failed to make the Billboard Hot 100 national chart. The fact that \\"Saint Paul\\" was re-published by Maclen was seen by some Beatle fans as evidence of a conspiracy involving Knight, the Beatles and the \\"Paul is dead\\" rumor. \\"Saint Paul\\" was re-recorded in 1969 by New Zealand singer Shane and became one of the best-selling singles of the 1960s in that country. In the early 1990s author Andru Reeve repeatedly tried to interview Knight while writing a book about the \\"Paul is dead\\" hoax. Reeve was unable to get Knight to talk about the song.  Grand Funk Railroad  Still working as a producer with Capitol, Knight renewed his connection with two former Pack members, guitarist Mark Farner and drummer Don Brewer. Knight encouraged the two to add a new bass player and become a \\"power trio\\" along the lines of Cream. The group quickly added former Mysterians bassist Mel Schacher and changed their name to 'Grand Funk Railroad'. While becoming their manager-producer, Knight helped steer the trio to international fame, beginning with his getting them onto the bill‚Äîfor free‚Äîat the 1969 Atlanta Pop Festival. This live performance convinced Capitol to sign the trio. For the next two years, Grand Funk Railroad became the most popular rock attraction in the United States despite mixed critical reviews that Knight exploited as part of their appeal; he also discovered and produced the Fort Worth, Texas group Bloodrock, who hit the Top 40 in early 1971 with the unlikely death anthem \\"D.O.A. (Dead On Arrival)\\". Between Grand Funk and Bloodrock, Knight racked up an unprecedented eight gold albums while simultaneously waging a war of words with Rolling Stone over the magazine's frequent pannings of the two acts. But by early 1972, both Grand Funk and Bloodrock had severed their professional relations with Knight. In Grand Funk's case, it involved court actions that kept the band tied up for almost two full years; they had demanded full royalty accounting and accused Knight of double-dipping as manager-producer while the trio had not been getting all the monies they had earned. For his part, Knight would claim the band had had only three months left on their contract with him when they first took him to court and could have been free with half the legal aggravation; the trio ultimately won their separation from Knight but at heavy cost, before adding keyboard player Craig Frost and continuing a successful recording and touring career through 1976.  Life after Grand Funk  Knight was also dropped from Capitol soon after the Grand Funk court actions were resolved and began his own label, Brown Bag Records, releasing albums and singles by Mom's apple pie,Perrone, Pierre.

None of them found commercial success and, in late 1973, Knight retired permanently from show business. He associated with super model Twiggy and raced cars with film star Paul Newman in the mid-1970s before becoming addicted to cocaine, which consumed him. By the 1980s he had straightened himself out, settling in Yuma, Arizona with his daughter Danielle. He melded into the community working in advertising sales for a weekly newspaper.  Death  On November 1, 2004, Terry Knight was murdered at the age of 61. He was stabbed multiple times by his teenage daughter's boyfriend Donald A. Fair in their shared apartment in Temple, Texas, after Knight attempted to intercede in an argument over Fair's use of methamphetamine. Fair claimed he was high on methamphetamine at the time of the killing, in an attempt to mitigate his sentence. Fair was sentenced on May 26, 2005 to life in prison. Terry Knight was cremated and buried in a family plot in Lapeer, Michigan. He is survived by daughter, Danielle. Four years after his death, Terry Knight and The Pack were voted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends online Hall of Fame.  References  External links  * Terry Knight ‚Äì R.I.P. by David K.

It was created by Paul Williams, a Swarthmore College student at the time, in response to the increasing sophistication and cultural influence of popular music. The magazine was named after the Crawdaddy Club in London and published during its early years with an exclamation point, as Crawdaddy! According to The New York Times, Crawdaddy was \\"the first magazine to take rock and roll seriously\\",NY Times, June 9, 1976 while the magazine's rival Rolling Stone acknowledged it as \\"the first serious publication devoted to rock & roll news and criticism\\". Cited in Preceding both Rolling Stone and Creem, Crawdaddy was the training ground for many rock writers just finding the language to describe rock and roll,Peter Knobler on CrawdaddyPaul Williams interview which was only then beginning to be written about as studiously as folk music and jazz.Williams interview The magazine spawned the career of numerous rock and other writers. Early contributors included Jon Landau, Sandy Pearlman, Richard Meltzer and Peter Knobler. Issue #8 from March 1967. See page 3 for Table of Contents, showing authors. Also issue #19, page 3. After Williams left Crawdaddy in 1968, the magazine was edited by Knobler from 1972 until its last issue in 1979.Peter Knobler on Crawdaddy From 1993 to 2003 Williams self-published a Crawdaddy reincarnation. In 2006 it was sold to Wolfgang's Vault and later resurrected as a daily webzine.Crawdaddy.com Effective August 5, 2011, visits began redirecting to the music website Paste, which announced that Crawdaddy \\"relaunches as a blog on Paste, where we‚Äôll share stories from the Crawdaddy archives and publish new content on legacy artists\\".Post at pastemagazine.com/blogs/crawdaddy  Fanzine roots  Named after the legendary Crawdaddy Club in England at which the Rolling Stones played their first gig, Crawdaddy was started on the campus of Swarthmore College. Williams was a science fiction fan who at the age of 17 started mimeographing and distributing a collection of criticisms (at first mostly his own) about rock and roll music and musicians. (He had begun publishing a science fiction fanzine, Within, at the age of 14, and later recruited some of his fellow fans to help.)Williams interviewFanzines Crawdaddy quickly moved from its fanzine roots (the first issue was mimeographed by fellow fan Ted White) to become one of the first rock music \\"prozines\\", with newsstand distribution.Ticket to Write : The Golden Age of Rock Music Journalism, directed and written by Raul Sandelin(New York: Road Ahead Productions, April 27 2016) > You are looking at the first issue of a magazine of rock and roll criticism. > Crawdaddy will feature neither pin-ups nor news-briefs; the specialty of > this magazine is intelligent writing about pop music.... :‚ÄîIssue 1, February > 7, 1966  Mass market magazine  Crawdaddy briefly suspended publication in 1969, then returned, with its title unpunctuated, in 1970, as a monthly with national mass market distribution, first as a quarterfold newsprint tabloid, then as a standard-sized magazine. Crawdaddy continued through the decade, led by editor-in-chief Peter Knobler (who first wrote for the original Crawdaddy under Williams in October 1968), with senior editor Greg Mitchell, featuring contributions from Joseph Heller, John Lennon, Tim O'Brien, Michael Herr, Gilda Radner, Dan Aykroyd, P.J. O'Rourke and Cameron Crowe, plus a roster of columnists including at times William S. Burroughs, Paul Krassner, David G. Hartwell, the Firesign Theater, and sometimes Paul Williams himself. While on the run from the law, Abbie Hoffman was Crawdaddy 's travel editor. As the decade progressed, the Crawdaddy staff included Timothy White (later, an editor of Billboard), Mitch Glazer, Denis Boyles, Noe Goldwasser, John Swenson, Bruce Malamut and Jon Pareles, plus notable freelance photographers including David Gahr, Francesco Scavullo, and Ed Gallucci. Because of such notable talent, Crawdaddy has been described as the Buffalo Springfield of the rock magazine world. Crawdaddy was a generational magazine known for its well- written, insightful profiles particularly of musicians, but also a diverse mix of filmmakers, athletes, politicians, comedians and other celebrities prominent in 1970s pop culture, including Sly Stone, Bob Marley, the Who, Eric Clapton, the Rolling Stones, Mel Brooks, John Belushi, Jack Nicholson, Gregg Allman, Muhammad Ali, Joni Mitchell, Bonnie Raitt, Linda Ronstadt, Roxy Music, Little Feat, George Carlin, Randy Newman, Paul Butterfield, Brian Eno and Roy Orbison. Under Knobler, Crawdaddys editors often assigned artists to write about other artists; Al Kooper profiled Steve Martin, Martin Mull interviewed Woody Allen, William S. Burroughs talked magic, mysticism and Aleister Crowley with Jimmy Page.Publishers Weekly review\\"Rock Magic\\", Crawdaddy, June 1975 The magazine's record reviews, capsule reviews and film reviews sections, driven by editors Goldwasser and Swenson, shared an iconoclastic reputation that was well known by the music and film industries for its fierce independence. Crawdaddys features section regularly covered scenes from New Orleans funk to Austin, Texas' cosmic cowboys to Scientology, est and disco. Its renowned sense of humor produced the Crawdoodah Gazette, The Whole Earth Conspiracy Catalogue and \\"The Assassination Please Almanac\\". In 1976 the magazine published the first in-depth article on the life and bizarre death of country- rock pioneer Gram Parsons, anticipating the wealth of information published about him in later years. Greg Mitchell went on to write various books concerning U.S. political events.  Discovers Bruce Springsteen  Among Crawdaddys scoops: the first major profile of Bruce Springsteen, written in December 1972 by Peter Knobler with special assistance from Greg Mitchell. \\"He sings with a freshness and urgency I haven't heard since I was rocked by 'Like a Rolling Stone,'\\" Knobler wrote. Knobler's Crawdaddy discovered Springsteen in the rock press and was his earliest champion. Springsteen and the E Street Band acknowledged by giving a private performance at the Crawdaddy 10th Anniversary Party in New York City in June 1976.Crawdaddy Party Mirrors Magazine, NY Times, June 9, 1976 Knobler profiled Springsteen in 1973, 1975 and 1978.  Rename and closure  Under Peter Knobler's editorship from 1972 to 1979, Crawdaddys focus expanded to cover more general aspects of popular culture, particularly politics, sports and movies, and in 1979 the magazine changed its title to Feature. When the music business retrenched, Feature lost much of its advertising revenue, and after five issues at the beginning of 1979 it ceased publication. Knobler went on to collaborate on numerous best- selling books, including the political memoir All's Fair by James Carville and Mary Matalin and the autobiographies of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Hakeem Olajuwon, Governor Ann Richards, NYPD Commissioner William Bratton, Sumner Redstone, and Tommy Hilfiger.  Later relaunches  Paul Williams reclaimed the punctuated title in 1993, publishing 28 issues until financial pressures forced him to end its run in 2003. In 2006 Williams sold the rights to the Crawdaddy name as well as all of his published works in back issues and a handful of his authored books to Wolfgang's Vault. In May 2007, the magazine was re-launched as an online publication at Crawdaddy.com, equipped with video and MP3 capability. Credited for its reputation for \\"thinking man's music writing\\" by Magnet, Crawdaddy operated as a daily music news blog and source for longform music journalism, with a team of freelancers spanning the globe and a small San Francisco-based editorial staff headed by Editor-in-Chief Angela Zimmerman, who succeeded Jocelyn Hoppa. At the film, music and culture website PasteMagazine.com, where Crawdaddy appeared as a blog on August 5, 2011, the host site undertakes to import and maintain the Crawdaddy archive, and promises to continue to post not only archival but new material from \\"many of the columnists and writers you might have enjoyed at the Crawdaddy website\\". The magazine's content spanned the entire age of rock 'n' roll from its inception (and all of the genre's derivatives) to extensive coverage on new and breaking bands. Regular columns and features included interviews, reviews, song histories, lyrical dissections, interviews on songwriting, roadie tales courtesy of Dinky Dawson, new classics, music and politics, crate diggers, the weakest cut, memoir and fiction pieces, in-house video sessions and interviews, and more.

Harmondsworth: Penguin; p. 198 Children of Brychan According to Christian tradition, Brychan was married three times ‚Äì to Prawst ferch Tydwal, Banhadlwedd ferch Banadi, and Gwladys ‚Äì and had a very large family. These wives are mentioned in several manuscripts, including those by William Worcester, John Leland, and Nicholas Roscarrock. The number of children attributed to him varies from twelve to sixty-three, the number most frequently encountered being twenty-four. There are two main lists however, one of Welsh origin and one of Cornish origin. Most of his children appear to have travelled from Brecon to evangelise Cornwall and North Devon, where they are now venerated, but there is little agreement between the two lists. The number of Brychan's children may have grown over time, as more and more secular people as well as saints wished to claim descent from one of the \\"Holy Families of Britain\\". Listed below are children from Welsh, Cornish, Irish, and Breton sources: Sons in Welsh sources The sons listed in the Cognacio Brychan, De Situ Brecheniauc and the genealogies of Jesus College MS 20 are Cynog, Rhain Dremrudd, Clydwyn, Arthen, Papai, Dingad, Berwyn and Rhydog. Also listed, but not in all three, are Cynon, Pasgen, Cylflifer, Marthaerun and Rhun. Other Welsh sources claim the following additional sons: Caian, Cynbryd, Cynfran, Cynin, Dogfan, Dyfnan, Dyfrig, Hychan, Llecheu, Neffei, Rhawin, Llofan, Llonio, Heilin, Afallach and Gwynnws.

It was later found that the United States Department of Justice and the CIA had covered up evidence in the case. Wilson's convictions were overturned in 2003 and he was freed the following year. Early life Edwin P. Wilson was born to a poor farming family in Nampa, Idaho in 1928. He first worked as a merchant seaman. In 1953, Wilson earned a psychology degree from the University of Portland. That same year, Wilson joined the Marines and fought in the last days of the Korean War. He was said to have been impressive during his military service and, when he was discharged in 1956 for a knee injury, went to work for the Central Intelligence Agency. CIA career Wilson's first assignments were for the Office of Security; this included a stint in 1956 guarding U-2 spy planes in Turkey. In 1960, the Agency sent him to Cornell University for graduate studies in Labor Relations. He put this and his knowledge of psychology to use in the Agency's International Organizations Division (IOD) tackling communism in trade unions around the world. Wilson was involved in attempts to destabilize European labour unions, for example, by using methods as diverse as involving Corsican mobsters and using plagues of cockroaches. However, Wilson's most valuable time for the CIA was in Special Operations Division (SOD) setting up front companies like Maritime Consulting Associates (1964) and Consultants International (1965), which were used to covertly ship supplies around the world. For example, cargoes included disassembled boats sent to central Africa where they were welded together on the shores of Lake Tanganyika and used to intercept Soviet arms being ferried across the lake to rebels in the Congo; arms to Angola; crowd-control gear to Chile, Brazil and Venezuela; all kinds of equipment for intelligence-gathering facilities in Iran; supplies for a group of dissident army officers planning a coup in Indonesia; and barges sent to Vietnam. As director of these firms, which were conducted as legitimate businesses, Wilson began to amass a lot of money, but as a contractor, not an employee. He invested in property around the world. In 1971, after 15 years with the CIA, events that have been disputed ended Wilson's official career there. He nevertheless received a year's pay and acquired ownership of some of his front companies. ONI career In 1971, with the CIA's knowledge and approval, Wilson moved to the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) where he worked full-time for a secret intelligence unit called the Naval Field Operations Support Group (NFOSG) or Task Force 157. Between its inception in 1966 and termination in 1977, the focus was on acquiring intelligence on Soviet naval activity. However, the unit's remit was wider and later described as ‚Äúthe U.S. military's only network of undercover agents and spies operating abroad using commercial and business 'cover' for their espionage.\\" At this time, Wilson set up another front company‚ÄîWorld Marine, Inc.‚Äîto assist with his logistics work. Wilson then retired from the ONI in 1976 after events that have been disputed. After a change in commanders, Wilson reportedly appealed to Admiral Bobby Inman, the Director of Naval Intelligence, offering his influence in Congress to the ONI's budget troubles if he, Wilson, could be made chief of Task Force 157. Allegedly outraged, Inman shut down Task Force 157 altogether and reported Wilson to the FBI. However, other calculations may have been in play. Wilson continued to run the businesses he had built under the guidance of the CIA, the largest of which was Consultants International. He reportedly amassed a fortune of over $20 million through these businesses, and continued to offer covert shipping services at the request of the CIA after his official retirement. Arms for Libya controversy In the 1970s, he became involved in dealings with Libya. Wilson claims that a high-ranking CIA official Theodore \\"Blond Ghost\\" Shackley asked him to go to Libya to keep an eye on Carlos the Jackal, the infamous terrorist, who was living there. At the time, a strict sanctions regime was in place against Libya and the country was willing to pay a great deal for weapons and material. Wilson began conducting elaborate dealings, and guns and military uniforms were smuggled into the country. Wilson also recruited a group of retired Green Berets‚Äîdecorated Vietnam veteran Billy Waugh among them‚Äîto go to Libya and train its military and intelligence officers. The Libyans used Wilson's provisions to advance their interests around the world, including training terrorist cells to build explosive devices inside radios. One cell trained by Wilson's operatives was the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command (PFLP-GC) under the command of Ahmad Jibril. Jibril was suspected of being behind the bombing of Pan Am 103 in Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988. In 1979, a gun that Wilson had arranged to be delivered to the Libyan embassy in Bonn was used to assassinate a prominent dissident. The next year, one of the Green Berets attempted to assassinate another dissident in Colorado. Wilson states that he regrets these incidents and had no prior knowledge of them. He states that he was still working for the CIA and his supplying of weapon to the Libyans was an attempt to get close to them and gain valuable intelligence. This included attempts at gathering information on the Libyan nuclear program. The most dramatic deal, and the one that brought Wilson to the attention of the U.S. government, was for some twenty tons of military-grade C-4 plastic explosives. This was a massive quantity that was equal to the entire U.S. domestic stockpile. Most of Wilson's connections were still under the impression that he was working for the CIA and a wide network in the United States supported his actions. The explosives were presumed assembled by a California company and hidden in barrels of oil drilling mud. They were presumed flown to Libya aboard a chartered jet. Another scandal broke out around Wilson when a company he had formed to ship United States military aid to Egypt was convicted of overcharging the United States Department of Defense by $8 million. A partner with Edwin P. Wilson in this company was another former CIA officer, Thomas G. Clines. Wilson also maintained that Major General Richard V. Secord was also a \\"silent partner\\" in this company, though Secord denied this allegation. Nonetheless, Wilson, Clines and Theodore Shackley (another former CIA officer) were all working together with Secord in the summer of 1984 when Oliver North approached Secord to ask for help in buying arms for the Contras, a group of armed rebels then trying to overturn the leftist Sandinista government of Nicaragua. Investigation and conviction After a lengthy investigation by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (then part of the U.S. Department of the Treasury), Wilson was indicted by the U.S. Justice Department for firearms and explosives violations. However, he was in Libya, which would not extradite him. Wilson was very unhappy in Libya, the Libyans were suspicious of him, and he feared for his safety. The prosecutors, led by Lawrence Barcella, knew this and they sent a con-person with links to the CIA named Ernest Keiser to convince Wilson that he would be safe in the Dominican Republic. Wilson flew to the Caribbean, but upon arrival was arrested and flown to New York. He was put on trial four separate times. He was found not guilty of trying to hire a group of Cubans to kill a Libyan dissident. He was found guilty of exporting guns, including the one used in the Bonn assassination and of shipping the explosives and sentenced to 15 years in prison for the former and 17 years for the latter. While awaiting trial, he allegedly approached a fellow prisoner and attempted to hire him to kill the federal prosecutors. This prisoner was never questioned by anyone outside the CIA. The prisoner instead went to the authorities and they set Wilson up with an undercover agent. The agent taped Wilson hiring him to kill the prosecutors, six witnesses and his ex-wife. In a subsequent trial, he was sentenced to an added 24 years in jail for conspiracy to murder. The voice in the recording was never solidly identified as Wilson's. Legal defense Wilson's defense to the Libyan charges was that he was working at the behest of the CIA. The CIA gave the DOJ an affidavit stating that, after his retirement, he had not been employed directly or indirectly by the agency. The CIA later informed the DOJ that it should not use the affidavit at trial, but the prosecutor Ted Greenberg decided to use it anyway. While in prison, Wilson campaigned vigorously for his innocence and repeatedly filed Freedom of Information Act requests with the government. Eventually, he found information linked to the memo and hired a new lawyer. His lawyer was David Adler, a former CIA officer who had clearance to view classified documents. Adler spent long hours poring through thousands of files and eventually found 80 incidents where Wilson met on a professional basis with the CIA and proof that the CIA had indirectly used Wilson after his retirement. \\"His revenge for his framing came almost too late. In 2003 his conviction for the explosives-shipping was overturned because, wrote the judge, the government had lied. Far from no contacts with the CIA between 1971 and 1978, there had been at least 80. Several ran intriguingly 'parallel' to the illegal acts he had been charged with. The next year he was released, white-haired at 76, fighting fit and pumped up with his own righteousness, to spend the rest of his days trying to clear his name.\\" A federal judge ruled that the prosecution had acted improperly. In October 2003, Wilson's conviction on the explosives charge was overturned. Wilson was released from prison on September 14, 2004, after being incarcerated for 22 years. Over 12 of those years were in solitary confinement. Civil action Wilson filed a civil suit against seven former federal prosecutors, two of whom are now federal judges, and a past executive director of the CIA. On 29 March 2007, U.S. District Judge Lee Rosenthal dismissed his case on the ground that all eight had immunity covering their actions.

His father was a native of Antwerp, who, having embraced the reformed religion, had been compelled to take refuge in the Netherlands. Entering his father's business at an early age, Jeremias found leisure to cultivate his taste for literature and especially for poetry, and to acquire without assistance a competent knowledge of English, French, Latin and Italian. His first poem was a paraphrase of the Lamentations of Jeremiah (Klaagliedern van Jeremias), which was followed by translations and imitations of Horace, Juvenal and other Latin poets. The most important of his original poems were a collection of epigrams (Puntdichten) and a satire in praise of avarice (Lof der Geldzucht). The latter is his best- known work. Written in a vein of light and yet effective irony, it is usually ranked by critics along with Erasmus's Praise of Folly. Dekker died in Amsterdam in November 1666. Works A complete collection of his poems, edited by Brouerius van Nideck, was published at Amsterdam in 1726 under the title Exercices po√©tiques (2 vols. 4to.). Selections from his poems are included in Siegenbeck's Proeven van nederduitsche Dichtkunde (1823), and from his epigrams in Geijsbeek's Epigrammatische Anthologie (1827).

It is less rugged and cost less than earlier Teletype machines. Teletype Corporation introduced the Model 33 as a commercial product in 1963\\"Auerbach Guide to Alphanumeric Display Terminals\\", Auerbach Publishers, 1975 after being originally designed for the United States Navy. There are three versions of the Model 33: * Model 33 ASR, (Automatic Send and Receive), which has a built-in eight-hole punched tape reader and tape punch; * Model 33 KSR (Keyboard Send and Receive), which lacks the paper tape reader and punch; * Model 33 RO (Receive Only) which has neither a keyboard nor a reader/punch. The Model 33 was one of the first products to employ the newly standardized ASCII code. A companion Model 32 used the more established five-bit Baudot code. Because of its low price and ASCII-compatibility, the Model 33 was widely used with early minicomputers.  History  Teletype Corporation's Model 33 terminal, introduced in 1963, was one of the most popular terminals in the data-communications industry. Over a half-million Model 32s and 33s were made by 1975, and the 500,000th was plated with gold and placed on special exhibit.Telephone Engineer & Management, Volume 79, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Publications, 1975 Another 100,000 were made in the next 18 months, and Serial Number 600,000, manufactured in 1976, the United States Bicentennial year, was painted red-white-and-blue and shown around the United States during the last part of that year and the year after. A Model 33 ASR in use in 1978 A Model 33 cost about $700, much less than other teleprinters and computer terminals at the time, such as the Friden Flexowriter and the IBM 1050. Early video terminals, such as the Tektronix 4010, did not become available until 1970 and cost around $10,000. However, the introduction of integrated circuits and semiconductor memory later that decade allowed the price of cathode-ray-tube-based terminals to fall below the price of a Teletype teleprinter. Teletype machines were gradually replaced in new installations by dot-matrix printers and CRT-based terminals in the middle to late 1970s. Basic CRT-based terminals, which could only print lines and scroll them, are often called glass teletypes to distinguish them from more sophisticated devices. Teletype Corporation discontinued Model 33 production in 1981.  Naming conventions: Model 33 ASR versus ASR-33  While the manufacturer called the Model 33 teleprinter with a tape punch and tape reader a Model 33 ASR, many users, specifically computer users, called this equipment an ASR-33. The earliest known source for this Teletype Corporation equipment naming discrepancy comes from Digital Equipment Corporation documentation where the September 1963 PDP-4 Brochure calls the Teletype Model 28 KSR a \\"KSR-28\\" in the paragraph titled \\"Printer-Keyboard and Control Type 65\\". This naming discrepancy continued from the Teletype Model 28 to other Teletype equipment in later DEC documentation. For example, Digital Equipment Corporation's PDP-15 price list from April 1970 lists a number of Teletype Corporation teletypewriters using this alternate naming convention. This alternate naming convention was continued as other computer manufacturers published their documentation. For example, Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems sold the Teletype Model 33 ASR as \\"Teletype ASR-33\\".  Technical information  A Teletype Model 33 ASR teleprinter keyboard with punched tape reader and punch. The left-front unit is the tape reader with its three-position START/STOP/FREE lever in the STOP position. A less-common tape reader had a four-position START/AUTO/STOP/FREE lever. In the AUTO position it could be commanded on and off remotely. The tape punch is the unit directly behind the reader. As it exits the machine, the tape passes under a triangular lip that allows the tape to be easily torn by lifting against the sharp edge of the lip. The design objective for the Model 33 was a machine that would fit into a small office space, match with other office equipment of the time and operate up to two hours per day on average. Since this machine was designed for light duty use, adjustments that Teletype made in previous teleprinters by turning screws were made by bending metal bars and levers. Many Model 33 parts were not heat treated and hardened. The base was die-cast metal, but self- tapping screws were used, along with parts that snapped together without bolting. As another cost-saving measure, the paper tape equipment was dependent on the keyboard and page printer mechanisms. Earlier Teletype machine designs, such as the Model 28 ASR, allowed the user to operate the keyboard to punch tape while transmitting a previously punched tape and to punch a tape while printing something else. Independent use of the paper tape punch and reader is not possible with the Model 33 ASR. The Model 33 used the seven-bit upper-case only ASCII code, also known as CCITT International Telegraphic Alphabet No. 5, with one (even) parity bit and two stop bits. It was usually geared to run at maximum speed ten characters per second speed, i.e., 100 words per minute (wpm), but other speeds were available: 60 wpm, 66 wpm, 68.2 wpm, and 75 wpm.Teletype Parts Bulletin 1184B page 35 figure 38 There were also many typewheel options. The Teletype Parts BulletinTeletype Parts Bulletin 1184B pages 27‚Äì29, figures 29‚Äì31 lists 69 available Model 33 type element options. The type element was cylindrical, with characters arranged in four tiers, 16 characters per tier, thus capable of printing 64 characters. The character to be printed was selected by rotating the type element clockwise or anticlockwise and raising or lowering it, then striking the element with a padded hammer, which would accelerate the element against the ribbon and paper., The Model 33 printed on 8-1/2-inch-wide paper, supplied on continuous 5-inch-diameter rolls and fed via friction (instead of, e.g., tractor feed). It printed at a fixed 10 characters per inch, and supported 74-character lines,Teletype Technical Manual Bulletin 273B page 1-15, 1963, Change 2 although 72 characters is often commonly stated. The Teletype Model 33 contained an answer-back mechanism that was generally used in dial-up networks such as the TWX network. At the beginning of the message, the sending machine could transmit an enquiry character or WRU (Who aRe yoU) code, and the recipient machine would automatically initiate a response, which was encoded in a rotating drum that could be programmed by breaking off tabs. The answer-back drum in the recipient machine would rotate and send an unambiguous identifying code to the sender, so the sender could verify connection to the correct recipient. The WRU code could also be sent at the end of the message. A correct response would confirm that the connection had remained unbroken during the message transmission. Finally, the sending machine operator would press the disconnect button. Note that the receiving machine did not need operator intervention. Since messages were often sent across multiple time zones to their destination, it was common to send a message to a location where the receiving machine was operating in an office that was closed and unstaffed overnight. The Teletype Model 33, including the stand, is 34 inches (86 cm) high, 22 inches (56 cm) wide and 18.5 inches (47 cm) deep, not including the paper holder. The machine weighs 75 pounds (34 kg) on the stand, including paper. It requires less than 4 Amperes at 115 VAC 60 Hz. The recommended operating environment is a temperature of 40 ¬∞F to 110 ¬∞F (4 ¬∞C to 43 ¬∞C), a relative humidity of 2 to 95 percent and an altitude of 0 to 10,000 feet (3050 m). The printing paper is an 8.44 inch by 4.5 inch diameter roll and the paper tape is a 1000 foot (~300m) roll of one-inch (25.4mm) wide tape. Nylon fabric ribbons are 0.5 inch wide by 60 yards long with plastic spools and eyelets to trigger change of the ribbon feed direction.

Various CCU types were available. Most operated on the telephone network and included the relevant user controls; variants included rotary, DTMF (\\"Touch-Tone\\"), and card dialing. An acoustic coupler for a then- standard telephone handset was also available. Another CCU type was called \\"Computer Control Private Line\\", which operated on a local 20 mA current loop, the standard serial protocol for computer terminals before the rise of RS-232. \\"Private Line\\" CCUs had a blank panel with no user controls or displays.  Related machines  A Model 32 used for Telex service. Note the three-row keyboard and narrower, five-hole paper tape. A Model 35 ASR, at the Living Computer Museum in Seattle The Model 32 line used the same mechanism and looked identical, except for having a three-row keyboard and, on the ASR model, a five-hole paper tape reader and punch, both appropriate for Baudot code. Teletype also introduced a more expensive ASCII Model 35 for heavy duty use, whose printer mechanism was based on the older, rugged Model 28. The basic Model 35 was mounted in a light gray console that matched the width of the Model 33, while the Model 35 ASR with eight-hole mechanical tape punch and reader was installed in a console about twice as wide. The tape reader was mounted separately from the printer-punch mechanism on the left side of the console and behind it was a tray for storing a manual, sheets of paper, or other miscellanea. To the right of the keyboard was a panel that could optionally house a rotary dial or Touch-Tone pushbuttons for dialing a connection to a network via telephone lines. The printer cover in later units also featured sound deadening materials, making the Model 35 somewhat quieter than the Model 33 while printing and punching paper tapes. All versions of the Model 35 had a copy holder on the printer cover, making it more convenient for the operator when transcribing written material. Teletype model 35 is mentioned as being used in \\"Experiment One\\", in the first RFC, RFC1. The model 35 was used as terminals for the minicomputers and IMPs to send and receive text messages over the very early ARPANET, that later evolved into the Internet. The Model 38 (ASR-38) was constructed similar to and had all the typing capabilities of a Model 33 ASR with additional features. A two-color ribbon and ASCII control codes allowed automatic switching between red and black output while printing. An extended keyboard and typewheel supported upper- and lower-case printing with some additional special characters. A wider pin-feed platen and typing mechanism allowed printing 132 columns fan- fold paper making its output similar to the 132-column page size of the then industry standard IBM 1403 model printers. More expensive Teletype systems used photo readers that used light sensors to detect the presence or absence of punched holes in the tape. These could work at much higher speeds (hundreds of characters per second). More sophisticated punches were also available that could run at somewhat higher speeds; Teletype's DRPE punch could operate at speeds up to 240 characters per second.  Historical impact  * ASCII was first used commercially during 1963 as a seven-bit teleprinter code for American Telephone & Telegraph's Teletypewriter eXchange TWX network using Teletype Model 33 teleprinters. * The Teletype Model 33 series was influential in the development and interpretation of ASCII code characters. In particular, the Teletype Model 33 machine assignments for codes 17 (Control-Q, DC1, also known as XON) and 19 (Control-S, DC3, also known as XOFF) became de facto standards.Tomasi, Wayne. \\"Electronic Communications Systems: fundamentals through advanced\\", Prentice Hall, 2001, p. 531. * The programming language BASIC was designed to be written and edited on a low-speed Teletype Model 33. The slow speed of the Teletype Model 33 influenced the user interface of minicomputer operating systems, including UNIX. * A Teletype Model 33 provided Bill Gates' first computing experience. * In 1965, Stanford University psychology professors Patrick Suppes and Richard C. Atkinson, in the pilot program for computer assisted instruction, experimented with using computers to provide arithmetic and spelling drills via Teletypes and acoustic modems to elementary school students in the Palo Alto Unified School District in California and elsewhere. * In 1971, Ray Tomlinson chose the @ symbol on his Teletype Model 33 ASR keyboard for use in network email.The @-symbol, part 1 of 2, Shady Characters, July 2011 * The serial ports in Unix and Linux are named \\"/dev/tty...\\", which is short for \\"Teletype\\".
