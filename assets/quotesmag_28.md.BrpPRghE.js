Levitin, PhD, and first published by Dutton Penguin in the United States and Canada in 2014.http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-525-95418-7 It is Levitin's 3rd consecutive best-seller, debuting at #2 on the New York Times Best Seller List,https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/ retrieved August 31, 2014 #1 on the Canadian best-seller lists,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books- and-media/bestsellers/bestsellers-hardcover-non-fiction- may-25-2013/article4226576/ retrieved August 31, 2014 #1 on Amazon, and #5 on The London Times bestseller list. In The Organized Mind, Levitin demonstrates how the Information Age is drowning us with an unprecedented deluge of data, and uses the latest brain science to explain how the brain can organize this flood of information. Levitin then demonstrates methods that readers can use to regain a sense of mastery over the way they organize their homes, workplaces, and time. It answers three fundamental questions: Why does the brain pay attention to some things and not others? Why do we remember some things and not others? And how can we use that knowledge to better organize our home and workplaces, our time, social world, and decision making? https://online.wsj.com/articles/book-review-the-organized-mind-by-daniel-j- levitin-1408137852 The book is divided in three parts. The first part focuses on attention. Levitin explains why attention is the most essential mental resource for any organism and describes how the brain‚Äôs attentional system works: it determines which aspects of the environment an individual will deal with, and what gets passed through to that individual‚Äôs conscious awareness. The attentional awareness system is the reason one can safely drive or walk to work without noticing most of the buildings or cars one passes by. Additionally, Levitin reveals that the phrase \\"paying attention\\" is scientifically true. Multitasking comes at an actual metabolic cost: switching back and forth between tasks burns a lot more oxygenated glucose (the fuel the brain runs on) than focusing on one task does, and can lead quickly to mental exhaustion. The second and third parts of the book show how readers can use their attentional and memory systems for better organization, from the classroom to the boardroom, from home lives to interactions with friends, doctors, and business associates. On publication, the book received praise from a wide array of people including former U.S. Secretary of State (and Secretary of the Treasury) George P. Shultz; Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal (ret.), Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning neuroscientist Stanley Prusiner, and head writer for The Big Bang Theory, Eric Kaplan.

Like all pumped- storage hydroelectric schemes, it makes use of two water reservoirs connected by a pressure tunnel: in this case an artificial reservoir near the summit of the mountain and the naturally occurring corrie lake, Lough Nahanagan, at the foot of the mountain. Water is pumped up from the lower reservoir to the upper reservoir, using surplus power available at times of low demand, and then allowed to fall by gravity from the upper reservoir back into the lower reservoir, passing through turbines along the way to generate electricity. The generating plant resides inside the mountain in a cavern measuring , which houses four reversible pump turbines with a combined capacity of 292 megawatts. The upper reservoir is deep, has a capacity of and covers an area of . The power station is designed to generate electricity at times of peak demand and is instantly dispatchable: it can go from standstill to full generation within 13 seconds, compared with 12 hours for some thermal plants. It can generate electricity at full load for up to six hours per day and has a round trip energy efficiency of 75%. Since 2004, Turlough Hill has been the Hydro Control Centre (HCC) for the entire ESB hydroelectric portfolio, which comprises 19 generators in total. An overhaul of the plant was planned for 2011 following the failure of Unit 1's stator bars. A subsequent investigation led to serious defects being discovered, which led to the refurbishment of all four generating units. This was being carried out by Voith Hydro and by mid-2012 was nearing completion. History Turlough Hill was first conceived by Dermot O'Riordan, Deputy Chief Engineer in the ESB's Civil Engineering Department. In 1964, ESB engineers visited several locations in the Wicklow Mountains, digging trial pits and boreholes, looking for suitable sites for a pumped-storage station. A shortlist of three proposals was drawn up by O'Riordan: an artificial upper reservoir at the summit of Tonduff mountain with an artificial lower reservoir in the Glencree valley; an upper reservoir using Lough Ouler, a natural corrie lake near the summit of Tonelagee mountain, with an artificial lower reservoir in the Glenmacnass valley; and an artificial upper reservoir at Turlough Hill with Lough Nahanagan as lower reservoir. The Turlough Hill site was chosen as the best of these options and work commenced on the scheme in 1968. The cost was estimated at IEP ¬£12 million. A loan of ¬£6 million was secured from the World Bank to partially finance the project. Contracts worth ¬£2 million were signed with Karlstad Mekaniska Werkstad for four reversible pump turbines and with Siemens for four 73 megawatt generators in 1969. The contracts for the civil engineering works were awarded to two German consortia: Beuscher-Teerbau for the upper reservoir and Alfred Kunz & Co. for the underground works in the lower reservoir. Concerns about the impact of the scheme on the scenery at the Wicklow Gap led to ESB, whose chairman and chief executive at the time, Tom Murray, was an enthusiastic supporter of the project, engaging the services of landscape architect Sylvia Crowe. She recommended that the upper reservoir be camouflaged by planting vegetation on its embankments and that the works on the lower reservoir at Lough Nahanagan be designed to fit into the background of rock. The siting of the transmission lines that would connect Turlough Hill to the electrical grid was a matter of some controversy. Objections to the lines, planned to run from Turlough Hill to the village of Hollywood, came from several quarters, including Bord F√°ilte, the Irish tourist board. In the end, it was decided that they would run underground from Turlough Hill for c. , to preserve the view at the Wicklow Gap, before emerging overground on pylons along the King's River to Hollywood. This added ¬£600,000 to the cost of the project. At their peak, the construction works employed over 500 personnel: many of the workers lived in a temporary camp adjacent to the site, which provided food and lodgings. During the initial exploratory works, a geological fault was discovered inside the mountain and the location of the cavern housing the generating plant had to be altered. of gelignite were stolen from the site in an armed raid in 1972. Archaeological investigations near the Wicklow Gap during construction uncovered part of Saint Kevin's Road, the ancient path that brought pilgrims from Hollywood to the monastery at Glendalough. The first generator went on line in December 1973 and remaining three soon followed. The scheme became fully operational in 1974. At the time of completion, it was the largest civil engineering project ever carried out in Ireland. The final cost of the project was IEP ¬£22 million. Following the completion of Turlough Hill, the ESB considered a number of sites ‚Äì in the Wicklow and Comeragh mountains as well as around Lough Derg ‚Äì for further pumped-storage schemes. However, Turlough Hill remains the only such scheme in Ireland to date, although the Commission for Energy Regulation has approved the construction of a 70MW facility at Knocknagreenan, County Cork.  Name  Whilst the original name is Tomaneena, renaming it ‚ÄòTurlough Hill‚Äô has a certain validity. The pumped storage station draws water from the mountain top lake, which thus becomes a ‚Äòdry lake‚Äô. There is a geological feature known as a Turlough; it is defined as ‚Äú(in Ireland) a low-lying area on limestone which becomes flooded in wet weather through the welling up of groundwater from the rock.

Outside the field of literature he was, at various times, a barrister, a publisher, a lieutenant colonel in the Intelligence Corps, the Director of Information‚Äîreporting directly to prime minister David Lloyd George‚Äîduring the First World War and a Unionist MP who served as Governor General of Canada, the 15th since Canadian Confederation. Born in Perth, Scotland, Buchan was admitted to the University of Glasgow in 1892 to study classics; during his first year at university he edited the works of Francis Bacon, which were published in 1894. The following year he was awarded a scholarship to Brasenose College, Oxford; shortly after his arrival he also published his first novel, Sir Quixote of the Moors, which he dedicated to Gilbert Murray, his university tutor. By the time he left the university he had published five books, including Scholar-Gipsies, the first work of non-fiction he wrote. Much of Buchan's non-fiction mirrored his circumstances: his time in South Africa resulted in The African Colony, the First World War led to a series of books about the war in general, and the Scottish and South African forces in particular. He interspersed his non- fiction with further novels, and also wrote ten biographies and four volumes of poetry, as well as numerous articles and stories for magazines and journals. During the war he wrote The Thirty-Nine Steps, the novel which has been adapted for film and television more than any of his other work, (film versions in 1935; 1959; and 1978, as well as a 2008 version for British television).

The son of prominent politician \\"Honest\\" John Davis, Davis attended Williams College and briefly taught before studying to become a Unitarian minister. He later studied law and moved to Chicago, Illinois to practice. He was mustered into service with the 12th Illinois Cavalry in 1862, later leading the regiment as a colonel. Late in his war service he was brevetted to brigadier general. In 1870, he died in the wreck of the SS Cambria. Biography Hasbrouck Davis was born on April 19, 1827, in Worcester, Massachusetts. He was the third son of U.S. Representative and later U.S. Senator \\"Honest\\" John Davis. He attended public schools then matriculated at Williams College in 1841. He graduated four years later, returning to Worcester to teach at the high school. After a year, he decided to instead pursue a career in the ministry. He studied in Heidelberg, Baden to study the German language. He returned to Massachusetts in 1849, accepting the pastorship of the Unitarian church in Watertown. Davis preached for only a few years before deciding to step down to study law. He was admitted to the bar in 1854, then opened a law office in Boston. The next year, Davis decided to head west to Chicago, Illinois, opening a successful firm there. Davis was mustered into service with the 12th Illinois Cavalry in February 1862 as a lieutenant colonel. Arriving shortly after the First Battle of Winchester, Davis was put in charge of scouting posts. On a mission around Bunker Hill, West Virginia, Davis successfully repelled a Confederate attack. The Confederates counterattacked the next morning, but Davis sent a band of forty troops out near Darkesville, West Virginia. Under Davis' command, they routed the opposing troops, killing 25, including the grandson of Charles Carroll of Carrollton, and taking 50 prisoners. In October 1862, the unit's colonel Arno Voss left for the recruiting serving, putting Davis in charge of the regiment until the next February. The unit saw action at the Battle of Harpers Ferry, escaping the surrounded fortification and taking a band of prisoners in the process. As part of Stoneman's 1863 Raid during the Battle of Chancellorsville, Davis was ordered to take a brigade to disrupt the Richmond, Fredericksburg & Potomac and Virginia Central Railroads. He returned to Illinois with the regiment in November 1863 to reorganize as a veteran regiment. On January 5, 1864, he was promoted to colonel after Voss was forced to discharge due to illness. The regiment was assigned the Army of the Gulf in Louisiana, fortifying Fort Butler near Donaldsonville. On October 31, he was reassigned to Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The regiment was moved to Memphis, Tennessee on January 5, 1865 to scout for Embury D. Osband and the 3rd Regiment Cavalry U.S. Colored Troops. He was brevetted a brigadier general on March 12, 1865 and was sent to George Armstrong Custer in Alexandria, Louisiana. However, he fell ill and was forced to resign August 1. He returned to Chicago and continued to practice as a lawyer, serving one term as city attorney. Davis married Martha W. Stickney in November 1850; they had four children. In 1870, he boarded the SS Cambria to tour Europe; the vessel sank off the coast of Ireland on October 19. Davis was one of the 178 lives lost; his body was never recovered. A cenotaph was erected in his honor at Rural Cemetery in Worcester.

Biography  Astrid Klein was born in Cologne in 1951 and trained at the K√∂ln International School of Design from 1973 to 1977. Klein became a Visiting Professor at the University of Fine Arts in Hamburg in 1986. In 1993 she became Professor at the Academy of Visual Arts in Leipzig where she continues to head the fine arts course. The artist has received a variety of awards including the K√§the Kollwitz Prize in 1997 and the Cologne Fine Art Award in 2001.  Art  = Photography = Klein began working with photography in 1978. Her early works were based on themes of human tragedy and often combined texts with images. Klein produces photographic images on a large scale to make what she refers to as ‚Äòphotoworks‚Äô, distinguishing them from straightforward photographs. Starting with images drawn from newspapers and magazines, Klein transforms them with a variety of processing and printing techniques in the darkroom, often verging on abstraction. The resulting works question assumptions about photography as an accurate documentary medium. Her photography work is in the permanent collection of the Tate.

He was considered a prominent Canadian timber baron of his time. The son of Ignace Aumon and Euphrosine Robichaud, he was born in L'Assomption, Lower Canada and went to work as a store clerk in Montreal after completing his schooling. He came to Bytown to operate a store for his employer and later opened his own general store there. Around 1830, Aumond began operating in the timber business in the Ottawa Valley. He held timber cutting rights along the Madawaska, Petawawa and Gatineau Rivers. During the late 1840s, Aumond built one of the largest steam-powered sawmills in Canada at the time. He later suffered a major financial setback but continued on in the timber trade at a reduced level. In 1833, Aumond married Jane Gumming. They had eight children. Aumond was president of the Bytown and Montreal Telegraph Company. He helped establish the Bytown and Prescott Railway and served as one of its first directors. He was a partner with John Egan in the operation of two steamships on the Ottawa River and also partnered with Egan and Ruggles Wright in constructing a horse-drawn railway to provide an overland connection around rapids to link the two steamship routes. He was also a director with Robert Conroy and Richard McConnell of the Bytown and Aylmer Union Turnpike Company which completed the road linking Bytown and Aylmer in 1850; Egan was company president. He helped organize the first fire company in Bytown in 1838, also serving on the first school board and on the Board of Health for the town. He was also a prominent member of the Ottawa Association of Lumber Manufacturers. In 1874, he ran unsuccessfully as a Conservative for the Ottawa City seat in the House of Commons of Canada. Aumond served in the Carleton County militia, reaching the rank of colonel. He died in Ottawa at the age of 69. The township of Aumond, Quebec was named in his honour.

She is mostly known as representative of the guide dog movement, through \\"Lara Guide-Dog School Hellas\\" a non - profit organisation that she co-founded in 2008. She is an activist, promoting human diversity, guide dog access, physical and electronic accessibility and animal rights. She is also a scientist with superior studies in experimental psychology and cognitive science. From 2006 to 2012, she worked as a researcher in the Human/computer Interaction Laboratory, located at the Foundation for Research and Technology ‚Äì Hellas (FORTH) which is considered to be a major scientific center worldwide. In 2008, during a visit at FORTH the President of the Hellenic Republic, Karolos Papoulias was moved by her presentation and did something extraordinary: he bowed and kissed her hand to show his respect. Ioanna-Maria is one among the very few visually impaired / disabled researchers around the world and the only one, employed in Greece. Additionally, she is considered to be a rare case of a person who is blind since birth to exhibit visual synesthesia. That is why, she is being asked to contribute to experiments, studies and projects regarding perception and the crossing of the senses. Every year, she is invited and participates in numerous conferences, arising matters varying from psychological research to guide dogs and contemporary issues as youth unemployment.,http://www.pseve.org/ic2/program/ECPA9-Scientific_Program.pdf Her knowledge in psychology is often shared on newspapers and blogs. She was the first person to enter with her guide dog (and a dog in general), into the Hellenic Parliament and the European Parliament. In 2009, she protested through the web because her guide dog was denied in two restaurants. She wrote a letter which went viral and caused great awareness. Following this incident, one year later a Spanish tourist named Antonia Pons Losada was not permitted into the new Acropolis Museum with her guide dog. As a result of local and international outcry regarding issues of guide dog access in Greece on August 2010, Ioanna contributed to the voting of the first national law, related to guide dogs. As soon as the law was approved by the Hellenic Parliament, she took her guide dog \\"May\\" and a Television crew for a visit to the Acropolis Museum. Today on the Museum's website we are informed that \\"guide and assistance dogs, are welcome\\". According to the law 3868/2010, guide, assistance and therapy dogs are allowed practically everywhere in Greece. The law was recently reviewed, including guide/assistance/therapy dogs who are still in training and clarifying that they can enter into transportation means, without a muzzle. While transforming Greece into a role model for guide dog access, she joined the board of directors of the European Guide Dog Federation to defend the rights and access of guide dog teams, throughout the European Union. In 2013 at the European Parliament, she and former MEP Jorgo Chatzimarkakis were the main rapporteurs for the voting of an E.U. direction, aiming to promote e-accessibility on governmental websites. The direction was approved in 2014. Ioanna-Maria, was two times a political candidate. One in the 2009 Hellenic National Elections with the Ecogreens Party and one in the 2014 European Elections with the \\"Greek European Citizens Party\\". She was a paracycling athlete. Always accompanied by her two guide dogs \\"Lara\\" and \\"May\\", she had appeared on several documentaries, TV shows, movies and public events., The references are mainly in Greek.

Viamonte was a 2009 legal decision in Florida that addressed the issue of whether or not a dentist has a right to announce credentials that are not recognized or approved by the American Dental Association. Francis J. Ducoin D.D.S. is a dentist in Stuart, Florida who had become a Fellow of the American Academy of Implant Dentistry (AAID) in 1989. He had also earned Diplomate status with the American Board of Oral Implantology (ABOI). Joining in the lawsuit was Dr. Frederick Costello, an accredited member of the American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry, and Dr. Steven C. Hewett, who also held credentials in implant dentistry from the American Academy of Implant Dentistry and the American Board of Oral Implantology. Drs. Costello and Hewett also held Fellowship credentials with the Academy of General Dentistry (AGD). All three of these dentists were contending that they had a right to announce these credentials to the public without restriction, but the Florida Board of Dentistry was restricting that right. The Board was requiring that any such announcements be accompanied by this disclaimer: \\"(Name of announced area of dental practice) is not recognized as a specialty area by the American Dental Association or the Florida Board of Dentistry. \\"(Name of referenced organization) is not recognized as a bona fide specialty accrediting organization by the American Dental Association or the Florida Board of Dentistry.\\" The Florida Circuit Court overturned the restriction and declared that the dentists had the right to advertise these credentials without restriction. There were two basic rationales for the decision. First, the court held that the disclaimer was an unreasonable restriction of free speech. In his opinion, Judge Frank Sheffield stated, \\"The Court finds that AGD, AACD, AAID and ABOI are reputable organizations that convey valid, meaningful, credentials,\\" even though such credentials were not recognized by the American Dental Association and were in areas that the ADA doesn't recognize as specialties. The second rationale was that the disclaimer conferred the force of law on the opinions of the American Dental Association, which is a trade association. The other organizations (AGD, AACD, AAID and ABOI) also had valid claims to legitimacy. The decision in Ducoin v Viamonte had national reverberations. Since that time, it has come to be regarded as established law that dentists with credentials from these organizations have the right to announce those credentials to the public, without interference from boards of dentistry.

This episode has received heavy controversy after a 5-year-old boy burned down his trailer home, killing his 2-year-old sister who was sleeping in the next room. It was suggested that the boy was inspired by this episode, when Beavis and Butt-Head burn down a comedy club. Plot Beavis and Butt-Head are sitting, watching television when they see a commercial for a documentary about a stand-up comedian who lives an affluent lifestyle from his earnings. Although Beavis would rather go to Stewart's house and burn things, Butt-Head decides that they should go to the comedy club to become \\"stand-up chameleons\\". They arrive at the club (named The Laff Hole), and Butt-Head goes on stage first, but only Beavis finds his jokes funny and he is eventually booed off stage. Beavis is next, and the audience exits quickly, leaving only Butt-Head to watch him. Inspired by an earlier act, Beavis attempts to juggle burning newspapers, but ends up burning the club down. The pair watch the fire spread from outside while they declare how funny and cool they both are. Controversy On October 6, 1993 (exactly one month after the episode had aired), Austin Messner, a 5-year-old boy from Moraine, Ohio, was watching this episode. That night, he snuck out of bed and attempted to copy the scene when Beavis juggles the newspapers and lights the club on fire. As a result, Messner burned down his trailer, killing his 2-year-old sister. One week after the incident, MTV decided to move the episodes to 10:30 PM instead of 7:00 PM and also decided to delete any fire references on their network show. They had to heavily edit the episode before they finally took it off the air.

He came from a family that had a widespread reputation as builders, plasterers and painters.*, included in the article on his father, Wendelin.  Life  Sleeping Grandfather and Hugging Couple (1827) His father was Wendelin Moosbrugger, a Court Painter for Frederick I of W√ºrttemberg. He received his first lessons from his father and another painter from Konstanz, Marie Ellenrieder, then studied at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich, with Johann Peter von Langer After displaying some paintings at an exhibition in Karlsruhe in 1827, he followed his friend, the architect , to Italy and became a part of the German circle of artists resident in Rome. While there, he sought the opinions and advice of Joseph Anton Koch regarding his work. In the summer of 1828, he made landscape studies in the Sabine Hills. He returned to Germany in 1829 and staged an exhibition of his Italian works in 1830. With a letter of recommendation to Tsar Nicholas I from William I of W√ºrttemberg, he embarked on a trip to Russia. He took passage on a merchant vessel at L√ºbeck, as land travel through Russia would have been difficult and circuitous at that time. The ship made frequent stops, so the voyage took three weeks, during which time he was almost constantly seasick. He remained sick upon his arrival and languished for a week without care, until he was visited by an old friend, Paul Emil Jacobs. It was too late, however, and he died, aged only twenty-six.

It describes paranormal or controversial theories and methods from a skeptical perspective.  History  Skepter logo 1988‚Äì2014. In its first issue, the contemporary president of Stichting Skepsis, astronomer Cornelis de Jager, wrote that the paper \\"could fulfill a useful task in explaining many seemingly miraculous things, and consequently to the clarification of the misconceptions that exist in many people's minds. Education of a hopefully large audience is the first and foremost task of our magazine.\\" From 1988 until 2002, astronomer was editor-in-chief, and when he was succeeded by Rob Nanninga, the magazine first appeared in colour. In 2007, to reduce costs, increase accessibility and facilitate production and distribution, Skepter has been concentrated more and more on the Internet. In that year, the frequency of Skepter was reduced from quarterly to semi- annually. On the other hand, its size grew from 20 pages per issue in 1988 to 48 in 2014. During Nanninga's editorship (2002‚Äì2014), the number of subscribers increased from about 1500 to 2200. After Nanninga's death in May 2014, he was succeeded as editor-in-chief by science journalist Hans van Maanen in December. The layout was revamped, and since 2016 Skepter has been issued four times a year again, as was the case before 2007. Since September 2017, the staff consists of editor-in-chief Hans van Maanen and editors Pepijn van Erp and CSI fellow Jan Willem Nienhuys. The paid circulation is more than 2300, the total circulation is at 2900.  Contents  The magazine deals with topics such as alternative medicine, magic and the paranormal. Examples include medical claims in reflexology, 9/11 conspiracy theories, tidal forces, the hype surrounding the popular book The Secret, forged doctorates from non- existent universities, the \\"ridiculous\\" verdict by an Amsterdam judge that the Vereniging tegen de Kwakzalverij could not label orthomanual therapist M.

Moreover, attention is given to clairvoyance, parapsychology, auras and dowsing, but also to Egyptian pyramids, aliens, crop circles and UFOs. Although Nanninga said that practices such as forging doctorates are a disgrace, he emphasised that (writing about) critical thinking can be interesting.

A Qing dynasty carved fish (not one of the original Tang dynasty carvings), previously placed on White Crane Ridge, and now displayed in the museum. The Baiheliang Underwater Museum or \\"White Crane Ridge Underwater Museum\\" is an underwater museum built around the White Crane Ridge of Fuling District (), Chongqing. It is China's first underwater museum. The museum is located on the Yangtze River in the Three Gorges area, near the Three Gorges Dam; it opened on May 18, 2009. The construction of the museum began in 2002 and has cost around US$28 million. The main architect was Ge Xiurun of the Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Baiheliang (literally meaning the \\"White Crane Ridge\\") is an archeological site in northern Fuling District that has since been submerged underwater due to the building of the Three Gorges Dam. The museum displays centuries-old inscriptions recording changes in the water level of the Yangtze River for around 1,200 years. The site consists of a stone ridge that is 1,600 meters by 15 meters in size. It is now submerged under 43 meters of water. Before the Three Gorges Dam was built, the rock ridge was only submerged during the summer and fall. Every 3‚Äì5 years, when the water level of the Yangtze dropped during the winter, the ridge and the carvings on it were exposed and visible. The stone fish figures and inscriptions recording water-levels and other information from the Tang Dynasty (618‚Äì907 AD) onwards could be viewed by visitors. The carvings include 18 fish carvings, poems written calligraphically, three Bodhisattva carvings, and a crane. From 1994, China's government departments involved with the protection of Chinese cultural heritage undertook research on the conservation of the stone inscriptions at Baiheliang. After a number of proposals, it was decided to make the site into an underwater museum. The stone ridge has now been enclosed in an arch-shaped glass covering that is filled with purified water to ensure that pressure on both sides of the arch is the same. Two underwater channels with long escalators have been installed from the riverbank, allowing museum visitors to descend and view the stone carvings and inscriptions. Some carvings from White Crane Ridge are also on display in the Three Gorges Museum in the city center of Chongqing.

He had been active in Mississippi and Washington, DC supporting the March on Washington and the Poor People's Campaign. He disappeared while participating in the 1973 American Indian Movement resistance in the Wounded Knee incident on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. His family never saw him again, and his wife believed he was killed there. She struggled to get Robinson's disappearance investigated. In 2014 the FBI confirmed that Robinson had been killed and buried on the reservation in April 1973; it released redacted documents to the Robinson family under a Freedom of Information Act suit, including redacted interviews with cooperating witnesses. His remains have not been found. The FBI said it had closed his case. Early life Ray Robinson was born on 12 September 1937 in Bogue Chitto, Alabama. He attended local segregated schools. Strong and athletic, he became a prize fighter. Activism After leaving boxing, Robinson became a civil rights activist and follower of Martin Luther King, Jr. He participated in the 1963 March on Washington and heard King's noted speech, I Have a Dream. Robinson attended the funerals held for three civil rights workers killed in 1964 in Mississippi. He participated in organizing Resurrection City, a camp set up in 1968 at the Washington Mall to draw attention to the plight of poor people of color in the United States. Robinson was affiliated with Bradford Lyttle, the founder of the United States Pacifist Party. Lyttle said about Robinson, \\"He was quite forthcoming and very vigorous and willing to take risks. He put himself out in front of the project. And we decided we would take him on into the South.\\" Rose Sanders (since 2003 known as Faya Ora Rose Tour√©),\\"Faya Ora Rose Toure\\", JRank the first black female judge in the state of Alabama, described Robinson as being called to the civil rights movement. She said in a 2004 telephone interview: \\"He was a true soldier. He was a true liberator. He really believed all people should be free.\\" In the late 1960s Robinson also supported the Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW), organized in 1967. While participating in a 1966 anti-war rally in Madison, Wisconsin, he met Cheryl Buswell; they later married. She had been raised in a Republican household, but dropped out of college to become politically active. Buswell returned with Robinson to Alabama, where they worked in grassroots movements for education and nutrition. They lived in Selma, Alabama, and had three children together from 1967 to 1972. During a 1973 meeting of VVAW, Robinson learned of the ongoing occupation of Wounded Knee, South Dakota by American Indian Movement activists at the Pine Ridge Reservation to protest federal government policies. AIM was appealing for supporters. According to his wife, Robinson decided to go to the reservation to support the occupation and work to align the rights movements of both groups of people of color. Four African Americans from Alabama went to Pine Ridge; three returned. Disappearance Cheryl Robinson never saw her husband again. She filed a missing person's report with the FBI and in October 1974 traveled to AIM offices in Rapid City, South Dakota, and its headquarters in St. Paul, Minnesota, but was not able to learn much more about her husband's fate. Most AIM representatives denied knowing of him being at Wounded Knee. She hired an investigator, Barbara Deming, and was told that her husband had backpacked into Wounded Knee during the night in order to avoid checkpoints. One person said that he was shot after failing to follow an order to report to one of the AIM leaders. Deming and Robinson corresponded for some time. In 2011, Buffalo-based attorney Michael Kuzma filed a FOIA request with the FBI for records concerning Robinson's disappearance. In 2013, Kuzma filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York to gain full access to documents about the case. Robinson was later declared legally dead although his burial site has not been discovered, and his body has never been recovered. Conflicting accounts Dennis Banks, then a top leader within the American Indian Movement, claimed that he had no knowledge of Ray Robinson. He said that he had never met him and learned of his being at Wounded Knee only through inquiries by his family members. \\"Over the years, the Robinson name has popped up and I‚Äôm not sure even who would have that information or where it was. That‚Äôs a complete blank to me.\\" But in 2001, Darlene (Ka-Mook) Nichols, formerly Banks' common-law wife in the 1970s, interviewed him while trying to learn more about the 1975 murder of AIM activist Anna Mae Aquash. Banks happened to discuss Robinson, saying that he had been shot by another AIM officer and bled to death because the group was under siege and had no way to treat him adequately. Banks said he saw Robinson's body and ordered a subordinate, Chris Westerman, to \\"bury him where no one will know.\\" He said Westerman was \\"gone for about five hours\\" and that Robinson had been buried \\"over by the creek.\\" (Westerman is the brother of activist, actor and musician Floyd Westerman.) In another account, Banks claimed that Harry \\"Mr. X\\" David Hill shot Robinson. However FBI files show David Hill had already left Wounded Knee in early March and Robinson was allegedly killed in April. According to Paul DeMain, FBI files show Hill was under FBI surveillance at the time of the alleged killing. Over time, other rumors and information surfaced. At a time of high suspicion of outsiders, many in AIM were said to have believed Robinson had been an FBI informant. Publisher Paul DeMain reported that a former AIM member described Robinson to him as a \\"loud mouthed nigger, who refused to pick up a gun during a firefight,\\" making him suspect. In 2011 AIM leader Carter Camp told Robinson's daughters that the Guardians of the Oglala Nation, commonly known on the reservation as GOONs, killed their father. They had previously been established by a reservation leader who was opposed by many activists. Activist John Trimbach criticized this account for distorting the history of the Wounded Knee incident and failing to provide substantive evidence of the allegations. In 2013 Robinson's daughter Tamara Kamara, worked with attorney Michael Kuzma in Buffalo, New York, where she lived, to file a Freedom of Information suit against the FBI and government to force the release of relevant documents. Her mother and remaining family were then living in Detroit, Michigan. FBI documents released in 2014 On 11 March 2014, the FBI released documents to the Robinson lawyer Michael Kuzma confirming the death of a black civil rights activist during the 1973 AIM occupation of Wounded Knee. A memorandum from the FBI dated 21 May 1973 reported that an Indian woman who had left the village said there were 200 Indians, 11 whites and two blacks in the occupation. Robinson was reported as having been accompanied to the siege by a black woman. She returned to her home town, but he disappeared. The Robinson family lawyer said FBI files included statements that 'Robinson had been tortured and murdered within the AIM occupation perimeter, and then his remains were buried \\"in the hills.\\"' One witness interviewed by FBI agents said that Robinson had been in Wounded Knee for approximately a week before his death. During this time, the witness said that Robinson had trouble adapting to the harsh conditions and discipline imposed under the siege. These conditions included a shortage of food, constant surveillance, regular shootings as the occupation was \\"under fire,\\" and the unilateral AIM command. The witness said Robinson tried to discuss strategies, but no one listened or gave him any serious consideration. After he got into a heated exchange with another activist, he was escorted to a house by a security team. There Robinson grabbed a butcher knife from a table and the team gathered around him. The witness said, \\"The next thing, I heard a loud bang and saw Mr. Robinson‚Äôs lower leg spin from the knee and rotate outward as he started to fall forward. His eyes rolled up as he went down.\\" The security team is alleged to have consisted of, among other members, Leonard Crow Dog, Carter Camp, Dennis Banks, Frank Blackhorse, Stan Holder, Harry David Hill, and Clyde Bellecourt. According to Bernie Lafferty, a witness who confirmed Robinson's presence on the reservation during the Wounded Knee incident, during an evening meeting, several AIM members openly discussed the murder of a Black man whom they had buried on the hillside. These members included Banks, Camp, Russell Means, Holder and Hill. Robinson had adopted a non-violent philosophy in his civil rights work. This position put him at odds with AIM, which conducted armed resistance to the federal government. This likely added to existing suspicions of him as an outsider to the Indian movement. The Pine Ridge Reservation had already been disrupted because of severe internal political conflict over the leadership of Richard Wilson. Years later AIM member Richard Two Elk described Robinson's behavior: \\"He would eat what little food we had. There was no food so everyone was trying not to eat and this guy was eating freely all the time.\\" AIM members resented his actions. Buswell-Robinson learned of some accounts of her husband from Barbara Deming's research. They corresponded in 1974. \\"He was sitting on somebody‚Äôs porch eating oatmeal. An Indian dude came up, ordered him to go see Dennis Banks. Ray said: ‚ÄòIn a minute ‚Äì I‚Äôm eating my oatmeal ‚Äì I‚Äôll go when I‚Äôve finished.‚Äô The Indian dude got affronted by Ray's lack of servility. The Indian shot Ray dead,\\" Cheryl Robinson wrote. Cheryl Buswell-Robinson said of her husband, \\"Ray did not respond well to that authoritative direction.\\" Richard Two Elk said that Robinson was the aggressor at the time he was shot. \\"I think it was just a reaction. He jumped up and he had a knife and started moving and someone reacted. It happened in a couple of seconds. I think it was someone's gut level reaction in the middle of a firefight.\\" Two Elk also said, \\"One of the things that was quite apparent was the conflict and the clash of the two concepts of social rights-civil rights and Indian rights. Indian rights are in a whole different context. They (blacks) were coming from rights within the system and Indian rights was about sovereignty and independent nations.\\" Another account said that Robinson was shot in the knee after the security team entered the bunker. He was dragged outside, beaten and taken to the Wounded Knee Medical Clinic. This was run by Madonna Gilbert Thunderhawk and Lorelei DeCora Means, as well as several other volunteer nurses and medics, including non-Indians. Ray was reportedly held in a closet, where he bled to death. In correspondence with AIM members, Camp noted that he left Ray in Eagle Bunker after he had been shot in both legs. Camp said, \\"I had to make the decision not to bring in Buddy Lamont until late afternoon after I knew he was killed in the early morning. I had to leave Ray's life to fight alone in eagle bunker after he was shot through both legs. I did these things to save other Indian lives.\\" AIM co-founder Clyde Bellecourt, who was at Wounded Knee for 51 days of the siege, said that he had not heard of Robinson during AIM's occupation. He only learned of the activist's name in the fall of 2013 after being approached by his widow Cheryl Buswell-Robinson. The late Vernon Bellecourt, older brother of Clyde and leader of an AIM chapter, was said to have known of Robinson's murder during the occupation. He reportedly said at one time that AIM had \\"really managed to keep a tight lid on that one over the years.\\" Legacy Robinson is survived by his widow, Cheryl Buswell-Robinson, and their three children, daughters Desiree Mark and Tamara Kamara, and son J. Marc Robinson. Representation in other media The 2009 PBS documentary, We Shall Remain: Wounded Knee, covered the American Indian Movement during and through the Wounded Knee Incident, as part of a history of Native Americans. This episode was criticized at the time in a 6-page letter to PBS management signed by Joseph H. Trimbach, former FBI Special Agent-in-Charge at the time of the events, his son John M. Trimbach, and five Native Americans who had been involved at Wounded Knee; they said AIM violence had not been fully portrayed and noted the allegations about AIM responsibility for Robinson's and others' deaths on the reservation, as well as the 1975 murder of leader Annie Mae Aquash, had been glossed over. (By this time Trimbach father and son had published their own book about AIM.) The PBS Ombudsman discussed their objections and carried their letter on his webpage on May 20, 2009. Author Barbara Nixon wrote a book about the events of Wounded Knee, entitled Mi' Taku'Ye-Oyasin: Letters from Wounded Knee (2014). Mi' Taku'Ye-Oyasin is a phrase in Lakota that means \\"All My Relations,\\" referring to the concept of interconnectedness among the people. It included several letters related to Robinson.

It is situated approximately north of Marree and west of Innamincka. The property is found to the south of Clifton Hills Station and is the driest permanently occupied pastoral holding in the country with annual rainfall of about . The main vehicular access to the property is via the unpaved Birdsville Track. The property was purchased in 1983 by Denis Overton and Gabrielle Overton and it occupies an area of . Both Lake Hope and Red Lake are situated within the station boundaries. Established prior to 1889 the property used to be stocked with sheep. In 1889 the owner was James White who sold Mulka along with Canatalkina Run which together occupied an area of and was stocked with 6,000 sheep. George 'Poddy' Aiston acquired Mulka in about 1923, he had previously worked as a policeman at Mungerannie after returning from the Boer War in 1902. By 1925 he had built the Mulka Store near the Mulka Bore along the Birdsville Track. The store was the only one in an area of approximately and carried the broadest range of stock imaginable. The Mulka Store Ruins are listed on the South Australian Heritage Register. Drought had gripped the area in early 1929 with George Aiston predicting that if it did not break by the end of 1929 then the area would be deserted by both Europeans and Indigenous Australians. From 1933 to 1934 the property was struck by drought again with Aiston being unsure if his 1,000 head of cattle were even alive. In late 1934 the property was struck by dust storms and then rain with the creeks flooding. George Aiston died in 1943 but his wife Mabel remained running the store until 1951. Airmail delivery to remote properties in outback South Australia, New South Wales and Queensland commenced in 1949. Mulka along with other remote properties including Mungerannie, Clifton Hills, Glengyle, Davenport Downs, Morney Plains, Mount Leonard, Durrie, Cordillo Downs, Tanbar, Durham Downs, Nappa Merrie, Lake Pure and Naryilco were also on the route. After Lake Hope was filled by three consecutive floods in 1989,1990 and 1991 Mulka Station owners Denis Overton and his wife Gabrielle Overton were granted a Fishing Licence in 1991. https://issuu.com/sin.a.matic/docs/mulka_fishing_articles_advertiser In 2000 the Fisheries licence for Mulka Station was passed on from Denis Overton to his Brother Gary Overton. https://www.pir.sa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/182747/Management_Plan_for_the_Lake_Eyre_Basin_Fisheries_- _March_2013.pdf In 2005 drought conditions were so bad that the property was completely destocked. By 2010 the rains had arrived further north so that Cooper Creek was flowing again as far as Lake Eyre. Gary Overton got to use his fishing licence to start catching Lake Eyre Golden Perch in the waters of Lake Hope. The licence allows the removal of of Lake Eyre Golden Perch, Welch's Grunter and the Barcoo Grunter but only once the lakes have disconnected from the Cooper Creek after a flood event. In 2012 floodwaters returned allowing Overton to net up to of fish per week which were trucked to Adelaide, with ice being brought back on the return leg. The station was also stocked with approximately 3,000 head of cattle. The land occupying the extent of the Mulka Station pastoral lease was gazetted as a locality by the Government of South Australia on 26 April 2013 under the name 'Mulka'.

The song was released as a free download on August 25, 2014 through Williams Street Records as a part of the cable network Adult Swim's 2014 weekly singles series. Deafheaven began performing the song live ahead of the single's release, as early as July 2014.  Writing  Adult Swim reached out to Deafheaven and asked if the band would create a song for its upcoming singles series. The band wrote a song that was meant to stand alone and would not necessarily be viewed as a sign of what a follow-up to its 2013 sophomore album Sunbather might sound like, though at the time of \\"From the Kettle Onto the Coil\\"'s release, vocalist George Clarke said Deafheaven had, \\"a lot of different ideas for that, already.\\" Clarke elaborated: \\"This is just a single, and it kind of follows the same formula as the last record. It's definitely us. Maybe it's a sort of in-between song, but I wanted to do the best I could, and I think with the lead melodies that it has, it'll be a welcomed new song. It doesn't necessarily reflect our full progression as a band, but it's a really solid song.\\" On the single's lyrics and song title, Clarke described the song as being \\"kitchen inspired\\". The title of the song is a reference to water overflowing from a kettle and landing on the hot metal coil heating element of an electric stove, and lyrically the song represents the \\"stinging sensation\\" that occurs from this event.  Reception  The song was met with critical acclaim. Writing for Spin, Colin Stutz said: \\"The heavy-hitting 'From the Kettle Onto the Coil' is a devastating six-and-a-half-minute assault that dips into vibier moments but never loses its edge in its relentless attack, a welcome follow-up to the gloriously shredded Sunbather.\\" Writing for Exclaim!, Alex Hudson wrote: \\"The song is a venomous scorcher, its crushing drums and climactic guitars making the first couple of minutes feel like a continuous crescendo. Eventually the arrangement shifts into head banging riffs, dramatically slow rhythms and a mellow middle passage, with frontman George Clarke's throat-tearing screams sounding particularly terrifying.\\" Writing for Consequence of Sound, Chris Coplan wrote: \\"After re-invigorating the black metal scene with last year's excellent Sunbather LP, Deafheaven return to basics with this latest single. The furious percussion and wailing guitars still crunch with similar monstrous intensity, but George Clarke's snarling vocals make the whole thing feel more raw and primalistic.

History The periodical had its beginnings in the founding of the newspaper Rep√∫blica, established 1910 by Republican sympathizers in the city of Ponta Delgada, following the establishment of the First Portuguese Republic. The republican Francisco Lu√≠s Tavares was the director of this newspaper, and after nine years, on 1 May 1920, along with the monarchist Dr. Jos√© Bruno Tavares Carreiro founded the Correio dos A√ßores, maintiaing a similar editorial style: : \\"...patent to the public the guidance of the new authorities and their motivation towards the successive problems derived from the national and international evolution.\\" It was a period of ideological confrontations within the First Republic, especially leading to the First World War, when Republicans and nationalists were divided about the direction the young democracy should follow. The newspaper was also the principal Azorean organ involved in the \\"Autonomy Campaign of 1924-1928\\", finding itself the centre of various currents of opinion, and whose editors consisted of members of the Azorean elite. Among its collaborators were the autonomist Aristides Moreira da Mota and Montalverne Sequeira, the newspaper's director Jos√© Bruno Carreiro, and parterns from the other islands, including Lu√≠s da Silva Ribeiro and Alfredo Mendon√ßa (from the island of Terceira), musician Francisco Lacerda (from the island of S√£o Jorge), and from the continent Lu√≠s Ata√≠de and Linhares de Lima. Those who were involved in the newspaper organized the Visita dos Intelectuais (Visit of the Intellectuals) to the archipelago in 1924. Similarly, its members contributed to the Autonomy Decree of 16 February 1928, that suggested a small decentralization of services to the Junta Geral do Distrito Aut√≥nomo de Ponta Delgada. Within the same context, it launched an appeal to Madeira autonomists, in order to vet ideal opinions, to which the Madeiran press responded with the editorial A Madeira quer. With the establishment of the Estado Novo, the Correio defended the unity and autonomy of the Azores. Through its mobilization of public opinion, the paper mounted the first Azorean Congress in 1938, in order to \\"delineate a project of unity for the islands\\". Following the Carnation Revolution, the headquarters of the paper was occupied in 1975 by its workers, who would go on to work in partnership with the newspaper. Eventually, in 1976, the newspaper was purchased by a group of individuals that included Am√©rico Natalino Viveiros, who become director.

No written records earlier than the 16th century survive, and there are no records of a Bishop √âmilien of Nantes. The legend probably has its roots in a real clash with the Saracens, who were present in the region at the time, but has been considerably embroidered. Legend There are no written records of the story of Saint √âmiland before the 16th century, only an oral tradition of a warrior bishop who came from Brittany with an army to fight the Saracens, met them at Saint-Jean-de-Luze, near Autun, died there after a bloody battle, and was buried there with his companions in stone coffins that fell from the sky. This bishop was called \\"Millan\\" by the local people. The story as it is told now is that √âmilien was Bishop of Nantes when the Saracens crossed the Pyrenees mountains into what is now France. Hearing of the advance of the Saracens, he gathered a crowd of the faithful in Nantes to fight against the infidel. He sailed up the Loire from Nantes and past the Morvan to Autun. The Saracens numbered 26,000 cavalry and numerous foot soldiers. They advanced to Autun and laid siege to the town. √âmilien led his forces and the people of the town against the attackers. He was victorious at first, but the tide turned and after a valiant struggle he was killed at the head of his forces. The Saracens cut off his head. He was buried in the village now called Saint-√âmiland. First written records thumb During the episcopate of Jacques Hurault of Autun (1512‚Äì1546) a brotherhood was founded under the patronage of Saint √âmiland, and the village of Saint-Jean-de-Luze was renamed Saint-√âmiland. A festival was fixed for the Sunday following the feast of Saint John the Baptist. Saint Aemiliani is first mentioned in a Missal of 1556, which describes him as a bishop but does not name his see. There are no records of a bishop by that name in Nantes. A set of verses and prayers was composed by √âtienne Chaffault in 1592 for services in Autun Cathedral. It names the saint as Bishop of Nantes and describes his decision to fight the Saracens, the battle and his death. The work was translated from Latin into French, with some details added, and printed in 1607. It omits the story of the coffins falling from the sky. The local people told the story, including the falling coffins, to the Benedictine Jean Mabillon in 1682 when he visited the village and was struck by the number of stone coffins in the local graveyard. Later developments √âmilien was little known in the diocese of Nantes until the 19th century. The bishop of Nantes, Alexandre Jaquemet, managed to have the saint reintroduced in the liturgical calendar with the blessing of Pope Pius IX. On 6 November 1859 the relics of the saint were taken to Nantes in a solemn ceremony. That year the Abb√© Cahour published a book named Notice historique et critique sur saint Emilien, √©v√™que de Nantes that gives a very complete account of what is known or conjectured about the saint's life. The parish of Saint-√âmilien-de-Blain near Nantes is now named after the saint, as is Saint-√âmiland, Sa√¥ne et Loire, near Autun. There is also a Saint-√âmiland near Tonnerre, Yonne. Nantes has a short street named Rue de l'√âv√™que √âmilien between the Place des Enfants Nantais and the Rue G√©n√©ral Buat. In March 2012 it was reported that the Society of St. Pius X was planning to build a large new church in Nantes dedicated to Saint-√âmilien. The saint is thought to help cure headaches, kidney stones and hernias.

Scott, a U.S. district court found Florida's constitutional and statutory same-sex marriage bans unconstitutional. On August 21, 2014, the court issued a preliminary injunction that prevents that state from enforcing its bans and then stayed its injunction until stays are lifted in the three same-sex marriage cases then petitioning for a writ of certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court‚ÄìBostic, Bishop, and Kitchen‚Äìand for 91 days thereafter. When the district court's preliminary injunction took effect on January 6, 2015, enforcement of Florida's bans on same-sex marriage ended. The state defendants appealed to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, where it was styled Brenner v. Armstrong. District court proceedings Pictured here are the plaintiffs in the same-gender marriage lawsuit. From left to right- Steve Schlairet, Chuck Jones, James Brenner, Ozzie Russ. Civil rights attorneys Bill Sheppard (Sheppard, White, Kachergus, & DeMaggio, PA) and Sam Jacobson (Bledsoe, Jacobson, Schmidt, Wright, & Wilkinson) filed Brenner v. Scott on behalf of a Leon County, Florida, same-sex couple seeking to have their Canadian marriage recognized by the state. Both plaintiffs in this case are state employees; James Brenner works for the state Forest Service and Charles Jones works in the state Department of Education. They complained of being unable to designate each other as a spouse in the state retirement benefits program because of Florida's non-recognition of and refusal to license same-sex marriages. A second couple (Steven Schlairet and Ozzie Russ) were added to the Brenner suit on March 16, 2014. Steven is a retired hospital administrator, and Ozzie manages a local fast food restaurant. This couple sought to obtain a marriage license from the Washington County Court House, in Chipley, Florida. As a result of the Clerk of Courts' refusal to issue the marriage license to the couple, they joined the Brenner lawsuit. Civil rights attorneys and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed Grimsley v. Scott on behalf of South Florida-based LGBT-advocacy group SAVE and eight same-sex couples seeking recognition of their marriages legally established in other jurisdictions. Both cases were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida and assigned to U.S. District Judge Robert Lewis Hinkle. Brenner was initially filed on February 28, 2014, and Grimsley on March 13, 2014. Each case names Florida Governor Rick Scott as the lead defendant. On April 21, 2014, Judge Hinkle ordered the Brenner and Grimsley cases consolidated for case-management purposes, though they remain separate on the docket. =Ruling= On August 21, 2014, Judge Hinkle issued a ruling in Brenner and Grimsley that granted the same-sex couple plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. In ordering the injunction, Judge Hinkle found that Florida's statutory and constitutional bans on same-sex marriage were unconstitutional: Judge Hinkle added: =Stay of injunction= Judge Hinkle's injunction ordered the Secretary of the Florida Department of Management Services and the Florida Surgeon General \\"and their officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys\\" to cease enforcing Florida's ban on same- sex marriage. It also ordered the Clerk of Court of Washington County to issue a marriage license to two of the plaintiffs. He issued a temporary stay of his preliminary injunction, pending resolution of the three same-sex marriage cases that were then petitioning for a writ of certiorari before the U.S. Supreme Court, and for 91 days thereafter: Bostic v. Schaefer, Bishop v. Smith, and Kitchen v. Herbert. He also removed the governor and attorney general as defendants. In a separate part of his injunction, which he did not stay, he ordered the state to revise the death certificate of Carol Goldwasser to include the name of her wife, Arlene Goldberg, one of the plaintiffs. They had married in New York in 2011. On October 7, 2014, following the U.S. Supreme Court's rejection the previous day of certiorari in Bostic, Bishop, and Kitchen, the Brenner and Grimsley plaintiffs filed separate motions asking Judge Hinkle to lift his stay before the 91-day period under the original order expired. The state defendants indicated that they object to lifting the stay. Judge Hinkle rejected that request on November 5, and on November 19 the state asked the Eleventh Circuit to extend Hinkle's stay pending appeal. An Eleventh Circuit panel of Frank Hull, Charles Wilson, and Adalberto Jordan denied that request on December 3. On December 15, the state asked Justice Clarence Thomas, as Circuit Justice for the Eleventh Circuit, to stay Hinkle's preliminary injunction. Attorney General Pam Bondi based her request on the need to maintain statewide uniformity, noting Hinkle's injunction was directed to just one of Florida's sixty-seven clerks of court. Justice Thomas referred the request to the full court which, on December 19, rejected Florida's request with Justices Scalia and Thomas dissenting for the record. On December 23, the Washington County Clerk of Court, whom Hinkle's injunction ordered to issue a marriage license to one of the plaintiff couples, filed an emergency request asking Hinkle if she was also required to issue marriage licenses to all qualified same-sex couples once his injunction took effect. On December 24, Judge Hinkle issued an order in which he noted that his injunction applied to the Secretary of the Department of Management Services, the Surgeon General, \\"and their officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys‚Äîand others in active concert or participation with any of them\\". He gave the Secretary until December 29 to explain whether he believes the injunction as written applies to each court clerk. Two briefs for the plaintiff same-sex couples told the court that all Florida clerks of court act \\"in concert\\" with the state defendants, that the statute that penalizes a clerk for issuing a marriage license to a same-sex couple was unenforceable because it was based on the statute the court ruled unconstitutional, and that the court could extend its order to cover all Florida clerks if necessary. In the brief for the Secretary of DMS, Attorney General Bondi said the court could make its order more specific and that a clerk is an \\"independent constitutional officer\\" not subject to the Secretary. An amicus brief filed by Florida Family Action said that the injunction as written applied to one clerk and that the district court lacked jurisdiction to modify it since the case had been appealed. On January 1, 2015, Judge Hinkle explained the scope of his injunction, writing that the Constitution rather than his order authorizes all Florida clerks to issue licenses to same-sex couples and that while clerks are free to interpret his ruling differently they should anticipate lawsuits if they fail to issue such licenses. In response, the law firm advising the Florida Association of Court Clerks reversed its earlier position and recommended that all clerks issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Between the time of Judge Hinkle's decision and its implementation, clerks in thirteen counties‚ÄìBaker, Calhoun, Clay, Duval, Franklin, Holmes, Jackson, Liberty, Okaloosa, Pasco, Santa Rosa, Wakulla, and Washington‚Äìannounced they would issue such licenses but no longer provide courthouse wedding services to avoid having to officiate at the wedding of a same-sex couple. Hinkle's stay expired on January 6, 2015, and same-sex marriage became legal throughout Florida. Court of Appeals proceedings With Scott removed as a defendant, Dr. John H. Armstrong, the state's Surgeon General and Secretary of Health became the lead defendant and the case Brenner v. Armstrong. He and the remaining defendants appealed to the Eleventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. All briefings were completed in December 2014 when the state declined its right to reply to the plaintiffs. On February 4, 2015, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals put its same-sex marriage cases on hold until the Supreme Court rules in pending cases. The state of Florida has dropped their appeal in the Brenner v. Armstrong case with the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. Despite same-sex marriage being legal in Florida, as of February 2016 the case is still awaiting a final injunction order in the Northern District Court from Judge Hinkle. Judge Hinkle issued his final order in the case on March 30, 2016. Hinkle's summary judgment affirmed the unconstitutionality of Florida's now defunct ban on same-sex marriage and explicitly ordered the state government to ensure equal treatment of same-sex couples in all areas of Florida law. U.S. Supreme Court On October 6, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari without recorded dissent in all the cases it had been asked to consider from appellate courts in the Fourth, Seventh, and Tenth Circuits, allowing the circuit court decisions striking down marriage bans to stand. The cases were: Bogan v. Baskin (Indiana); Walker v. Wolf (Wisconsin); Herbert v. Kitchen (Utah); McQuigg v. Bostic (Virginia); Rainey v. Bostic (Virginia); Schaefer v. Bostic (Virginia); and Smith v. Bishop (Oklahoma). This effectively started the clock ticking on Judge Hinkle's decision in the Northern District of Florida, 91 days from this date his stay would lift unless the state of Florida was able to get the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court to extend the stay. On November 13, commenting in an unrelated case on behalf of himself and Justice Antonin Scalia, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that the Supreme Court \\"often review[s] decisions striking down state laws, even in the absence of a disagreement among lower courts.... But for reasons that escape me, we have not done so with any consistency, especially in recent months\\". He referenced denials of certiorari or denials of a stay in Herbert, Bishop, Bostic, Walker v. Wolf, Otter v. Latta, and Parnell v. Hamby. The Supreme Court rejected a petition for certiorari before judgment in Robicheaux v. George (Louisiana) on January 12, 2015, and on January 16 agreed to hear the appeal in the four cases from the Sixth Circuit, consolidating them as one case titled Obergefell v. Hodges. It presented these questions to the parties: The court heard oral arguments on April 28. On June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court answered both questions in the affirmative. ;Bourke v. Beshear and Love v. Beshear (Kentucky) :Filed on July 26, 2013; the U.S. district court found the state's refusal to recognize same- sex marriages from other jurisdictions an unconstitutional violation of the equal protection clause. Additional plaintiffs joined the lawsuit to challenge the state's denial of marriage licenses to same-sex couples. On July 1, 2014, U.S. District Judge John G. Heyburn II ruled that Kentucky's denial of marriage licenses to same-sex couples violates the equal protection clause. He found that homosexual persons constitute a suspect class deserving heightened scrutiny and suggested the Sixth Circuit should adopt that standard of review. He found Kentucky's ban did not withstand even rational basis review. The Sixth Circuit reversed the district court and upheld Kentucky's ban on same sex marriage on November 6. The couples filed an application for certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court on November 17, which Governor Beshear supported on December 9. ;DeBoer v. Snyder (Michigan) :Filed on January 23, 2012; the U.S. district court found that the state's ban violates the equal protection clause, 973 F. Supp. 2d 757 (E.D. Mich.) on March 21, 2014. The Sixth Circuit reversed the district court and upheld Michigan's ban on same sex marriage on November 6 and the same-sex couples filed an application for certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court on November 17, which Attorney General Bill Schuette supported on November 24, ;Obergefell v. Hodges (Ohio) :In a case filed on July 19, 2013, the U.S. district court found that the state ban on same-sex marriage violates the due process clause, for the limited purpose of issuing death certificates. In a second case, on February 10, 2014, four same-sex couples legally married in other states asked a U.S. district court to require Ohio to record the names of both same-sex parents on their children's birth certificates. They amended their suit to challenge the state's denial of marriage rights to same-sex couples. On April 14, 2014, District Court Judge Timothy Black found for the plaintiffs. On May 29, 2014, the Sixth Circuit consolidated Obergefell and Henry. The Sixth Circuit reversed the district court and upheld Ohio's ban on same sex marriage on November 6, and the same- sex couples filed an application for certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court on November 14, which Ohio state officials endorsed on December 12. ;Tanco v. Haslam (Tennessee) :Filed on October 21, 2013; the U.S. district court on March 14, 2014, required Tennessee to recognize the three plaintiff same-sex couples' out-of-state marriages until the court disposes of the case. The Sixth Circuit stayed that ruling. The Sixth Circuit reversed the district court and upheld Tennessee's ban on same sex marriage on November 6. The same- sex couples filed an application for certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court on November 14, which Tennessee officials opposed on December 15.

It opened on December 9, 2015. It makes Tijuana Airport a geographically binational airport. Unlike the binational airports serving the Swiss cities of Basel (entirely on French territory) and Geneva (entirely on Swiss territory),Map of Geneva Airport in relation to the Geneva area, Geneva Airport website the CBX terminal is physically located in the United States but serves an airport whose main terminal and runways are in Mexico. A pedestrian bridge spans the United States‚ÄìMexico border, connecting passenger terminals between the two countries.

It is only as a check-in and processing facility for departing and arriving passengers. It has its own parking, check-in stations, and customs offices, but no gates or arrival facilities (thus functionally resembling Hong Kong International Airport's Terminal 2). There are almost 900 public parking spaces, and areas for passenger pick-up, taxis, and intercity and local buses. * Facilities on the Mexican side including Mexican immigration and customs. Access to CBX from Mexico is from the baggage claim area, where there are counters to purchase CBX tickets. Within seven months of the facility's opening, 600,000 passengers had used the facility, with a single day record of 5,800 passengers. History Image 1: Plans for a cross-border terminal date back to 1989. Here, one from Mexicana de Aviaci√≥n and Ralph Nieders, 1990 The first discussion of a cross-border terminal was part of a proposal initiated by Mexico's Minister of Public Works (Secretario de Obras Publicas) Gilberto Valenzuela Ezquerro who under Mexico's President Gustavo D√≠az Ordaz (1964‚Äì1970) was directed to modernize Mexico's airports and transportation system. In 1965, Gilberto Valenzuela approached then Mayor of San Diego Frank Curran with a proposal to jointly develop a Tijuana-San Diego airport on Otay Mesa, but at the time, San Diego considered Otay Mesa too remote. Gilberto Valenzuela Ezquerro then initiated the development of the Tijuana airport which was expanded from 128 hectares (316 acres) to 448 hectares (1107 acres) to accommodate a new terminal and runway. From 1965 until 1987, the concept of a cross-border terminal lay dormant until Dennis Conner America's Cup victory in Australia. Freddie Laker, who had pioneered low-fare commercial transatlantic routes and was the founder of Laker Airways, became interested in developing international commercial/charter flights through Mexico to service the projected passenger traffic for the America's Cup challenge in San Diego. He met with Rodolfo Ramos Ortiz, who had introduced charter operations in Mexico in the 1970s and founded Aerouni√≥n and Aerocharter de M√©xico, S.A. de C.V. Negotiations failed but the concept of a cross-border terminal continued to evolve. Image 2: Aerocharter-Nieders Tijuana cross-border terminal concept, 1991In 1989, Ralph Nieders, who had been involved in the Freddie Laker discussions, made a formal proposal to Mexicana de Aviaci√≥n, S.A. de C.V. in Mexico City. The proposal was accepted and a letter of intent drawn in 1990 for the acquisition of Martinez Ranch (parcel number APN 667-050-07) as the designated site for the cross-border terminal. The Mexicana de Aviaci√≥n/Nieders image 1 shown in this section became the first of a series of plans/diagrams that were created to better promote the project. Contact was then made with the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) whose plans for a \\"bi-national airport\\" had been undermined in November 1989, when the San Diego City Council lifted a building moratorium on Otay Mesa. SANDAG did not support the development of a cross-border terminal as it sought to again revive its efforts to create a bi-national airport on San Diego's Otay Mesa and Mexicana de Aviaci√≥n opted not to pursue the project in January, 1991. As Mexicana de Aviaci√≥n withdrew, in February 1991, Rodolfo Ramos Ortiz/Aerocharter de M√©xico looking at the Tijuana airport's potential for passenger and cargo operations to Japan and other Pacific destinations joined Ralph Nieders to continue promoting the cross-borer terminal. As shown by image 2, an updated rendering was then created showing a fully developed Tijuana airport and how its cargo and passengers would directly connect to San Diego's surface streets and freeway system. In 1993, San Diego's efforts to develop a regional bi-national airport failed and a recession during that same period also caused the collapsed of land values in Otay Mesa. The selected site for the Aerocharter cross-border terminal on the U.S. side was foreclosed. Efforts to build the cross-border terminal were then suspended. In 1994, Mexico initiated its airport privatization program and the cross-border terminal was refloated by Gilberto Valenzuela Ezquerro and Ralph Nieders. The Tijuana airport became part of the Pacific Airport Group, known as GAP (Grupo Aeroportuario del Pac√≠fico) consisting of 12 airports with 15 Million Annual Passengers and headquartered in Guadalajara. In 1999, a Spanish consortium won the concession and committed to developing the cross-border terminal but in August 2001, in an effort to reduce operating costs, canceled the project and Ralph Nieders resigned as GAP's cross-border project manager. The Tijuana cross-border terminal project then reverted to Mexico's airport authority Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (ASA) and was privately promoted by Gilberto Valenzuela and Ralph Nieders. In 2006, Controladora Mexicana de Aeropuertos S.A. de C.V. headed by Eduardo Sanchez-Navarro Redo, Carlos Laviada Ocejo and his wife Laura Diez-Barroso Azcarraga replaced Holdinmex S.A. de C.V. as the Mexican strategic partner within AMP (Aeropuertos Mexicanos del Pacifico, S.A. de C.V.) and assumed control of the Pacific Airport Group (GAP). Gilberto Valenzuela Ezquerro contacted Eduardo Sanchez- Navarro Redo and arrangements were made for Christian Checa Levien, son-in-law of Laura Diez-Barroso Azcarraga de Laviada, to meet with Ralph Nieders to discuss the development of a cross-border terminal and land options. A private tour and meeting at the San Diego International Airport was then arranged between Christian Checa and Ralph Nieders by Theodore Sexton of the San Diego Regional Airport Authority. The three potential crossing sites Martinez Ranch, Britannia Commerce Center and Martinez Trust were discussed. The cross-border terminal then became part of the strategic development of the Tijuana airport. Land negotiations on Martinez Trust as well as Britannia Commerce Center failed. Samuel Zell of Equity International then became interested and his representative David Contis met with Christian Checa and Ralph Nieders. Land negotiations on Martinez Trust then followed and in 2007 negotiations on parcel APN 667-060-02 (Martinez Trust) were successfully completed. Otay- Tijuana Venture LLC was then created to develop and operate the Tijuana cross- border terminal. After a quarter century of negotiations and planning for a cross-border terminal, construction began at the Tijuana airport in October 2013 and work on the U.S. side began in June 2014. The cross-border terminal was completed in December 2015. The project had an initial estimated cost of $78 million US dollars and a final completion cost of $120 million US dollars, funded by Mexican and U.S. private investors and Grupo Aeroportuario del Pac√≠fico. Building E of Tijuana's Terminal 1 was retrofitted to support the new bridge structure on the Mexican side. During the construction phase, a temporary border waiver between the U.S. and Mexico had to be issued by mutual legislation to allow U.S. construction cranes and U.S. fabricated steel bridge structural sections to cross the U.S.-Mexico boundary and be set over the six- lane Mexican Federal Highway 2. The main contractor for the terminal was Turner Construction Company. The civil engineer was Latitude 33 Planning and Engineering. Structural engineers were Hope Amundson Structural Engineers and Kleinfelder. The electrical subcontractor was Bergelectric. The mechanical and plumbing subcontractor was Industrial Commercial Systems. The site work and management subcontractor was Hazard Construction Company. Stantec Incorporated based in Alberta, Canada, was selected as the prime architect and facility designer with the late Ricardo Legorreta of Legorreta+Legorreta as the associate architect. The Tijuana cross-border terminal was renamed the Cross Border Xpress (CBX) and opened to passenger service on December 9, 2015.\\"Cross-border airport bridge to open in December\\", Sandra Dibble, San Diego Union-Tribune, August 8, 2015\\"Pedestrian bridge opens\\", Los Angeles Times, December 9, 2015 However, the official opening ceremony did not take place until April 7, 2016.\\"Mexican and U.S. Officials Inaugurate Cross Border Xpress (CBX) ‚Äì The Tijuana Airport Terminal ‚Äì In San Diego\\", Website of the U.S. Embassy and Consulates in Mexico For its design and innovation in the category of Airport and Ports, in April 2016 Engineering News-Report (ENR) gave the Otay-Tijuana Cross Border Xpress (CBX) its Global Award For Merit. and in September 2016, awarded CBX the Airports/Transit Best Project in California.

Manhattan Project From 1944-1947 Howland served in the Armed Forces. In 1944 he joined the Manhattan Project of the Corps of Engineers, which had started to develop a fission bomb. He served as medical officer in charge of special problems. This opportunity allowed him to become one of the early authorities on the medical effects of radiation exposure. Howland designed toxicity experiments and established occupational standards and emergency procedures. In 1945 he was assigned to Oak Ridge, Tennessee as Assistant Chief of Medical Research for the Manhattan Project. He organized the information from the Manhattan Project's laboratories and work sites. Howland organized the parties that went to Japan to analyze the effects of radiation poisoning, and served as chief internist-pathologist to the Nagasaki group. This was the first American group to investigate the effects of radiation on the casualties at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The group was replaced by the U.S. Army team led by Stafford Warren which later became the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission.Papers of Joe Wiseman Howland. (1981).

The Lockport Incident On 8 March 1960 in Lockport, New York an accidental X-ray exposure was received by nine civilian radar technicians that worked at the Lockport Air Force Station, a U.S. Air Force radar station that was part of the SAGE network. The recently installed Klystron tube failed to operate properly when voltage was applied. The technicians were exposed to X-rays while troubleshooting the problem. (NOTE: The Klystron tube serves as a voltage amplifier for the radar transmitter.) The technicians made an error in judgment and thought that the Klystron tube would not produce X-rays when the machine was not producing a radiofrequency signal. The men were exposed for a two-hour period with the Klystron tube at 60 percent of full voltage with 150 KeV X-rays being produced at 90 mA current.Howland, J.

The church is situated on the Avenue Sainte-Charles in the Monte Carlo district of Monaco. The church hosts the only English language Catholic service on the French Riviera, and offers Catechism classes in English for children and adults. History In 1879, the Monegasque prince Charles III commissioned the construction of a new church to accommodate the growing population of Monte- Carlo. One of the builders was Italian-born Jean-Baptiste Pastor.Philippe Bidalon, Roger-Louis Bianchini, Aline Cochard, Laetizia Dannery, Lea Delpont, Jennifer Schwarz, Pauline Sommelet, Vie √©conomique, L'Express, December 11, 2003 The church's dedication to Charles Borromeo highlighted the Borromeo family's historic ties to the Grimaldi family, the ruling family of Monaco. Bishop Charles Theuret of Monaco laid Saint-Charles's corner stone on November 11, 1879; it was completed and opened on Easter Monday, March 26, 1883, and subsequently declared a parish church on March 15, 1887. The altar of Saint- Charles church Theuret's successor, Bishop Jean-Charles Arnal of Curel dedicated the church in 1912. The church was restored and its facades renovated in its centenary year of 1983 by Prince Rainier III, he subsequently oversaw exterior renovation work at the church in 2003.

Solski fought in the 1939 Invasion of Poland. Captured by the Red Army during the Soviet invasion of Poland, he was murdered in the Katyn massacre, on April 9, 1940. Early life Solski attended high school in Lwow. In February 1913 he joined the local Sokol Organization, and soon afterwards attended military courses at Bolechow. In August 1914 he volunteered for the Eastern Legion, and from 1916 he served in the 3rd Brigade, Polish Legions. Polish Army In November 1918 Solski joined the newly created Polish Army and fought in the Polish-Soviet war of 1920, in which he was an officer in the headquarters of 9th Infantry Division. On July 1, 1923 Solski was promoted to Captain. At that time, he was serving in the 35th Infantry Regiment, stationed in Brzesc nad Bugiem. On January 1, 1932, he became a Major of the 57th Infantry Regiment, stationed in Pozna≈Ñ. In summer 1939, Solski was mobilized to the Reserve Center of 14th Infantry Division, with which he fought in the German invasion of Poland. In late September 1939, Solski was captured by the Red Army while attempting to escape occupied Kresy and flee to Hungary. He was first sent to a POW camp at Putyvl, but later the NKVD transferred him to Kozelsk. Katyn Massacre In spring 1940, Solski was taken to Katyn Forest, where he was murdered by the Soviets on April 9, 1940 in what is known as the Katyn massacre. He was buried in a mass grave, and in 1943 his body, marked with number 490, was exhumed by German investigators. Next to Solski‚Äôs body were two notebooks, a vaccination card, two Miraculous Medals, a bill and a referral to a doctor. While in Soviet POW camps, Solski wrote a secret diary. It was found by Germans in 1943 and published by J√≥zef Mackiewicz. After the war, its contents were read to Polish listeners by Radio Free Europe. His diary, which was kept until very last moment before the execution, is regarded as one of the most accurate records of life as a prisoner of war of the Soviets, as he described every day events at the camps. Solski stayed at Kozelsk together with his brother, Captain Kazimierz Solski who was also murdered by the Soviets, on April 17, 1940. The last entry in the diary is dated April 9, 1940: ‚ÄúFive a.m. From the very morning the day began in an unusual way. We are taken somewhere in a prison ambulance (terrible!) We were brought to a forest, to a location that resembles a summer resort. Here, we are carefully checked. My watch was taken away from me at 6:30 in the morning. They asked me about my ring, which (....) They took away my roubles, belt and pocket knife (...).\\" Solski was survived by his wife, Anna Leontyna n√©e Trojanowska (1906 - 1970), whom he married in 1926, and a daughter Ewa, who died in 2010.  Awards  * Silver Cross of the Virtuti Militari V Class (1921) * Cross of Valour (1920) * Silver Cross of Merit (1928) On October 5, 2007, the Polish Minister of National Defence posthumously promoted Solski to Sub-Colonel. In 2009, a commemorative plaque, dedicated to Solski, was unveiled in Katyn near Otwock.

The taxation of minerals serves as a price to extract scarce resources, such as petroleum and crude oil, which are owned by the government. By taxing minerals, the government is able to secure a certain share of the minerals. Mineral taxes should possess neutral characteristics, to maintain incentives for investors and maximize the tax revenue for the government, while minimizing the variability and uncertainty of the amount of tax money collected. Since the 1950s it is more common to use special taxes like royalty taxes with ordinary taxes. Taxing minerals is the more economic approach to incentivise environmental thinking and an alternative to intervene in the market directly.  Level of taxation  The decision about the size of the tax influences the allocative decisions of the firms. If the government sets a tax which firms consider as too high, they will extract less minerals, and tax revenues for the government will be low. But mineral mines will live longer, since there is less exploitation. If on the other hand the imposed tax is too low, firms will extract more, and the mines will live shorter. On top of that tax revenues for the government would be low, too. That leads to a Laffer curve-shaped function of tax revenue for the government, in which the ‚Äúoptimal level of taxation‚Äù is somewhere in the middle. Any mineral tax must be neutral. Neutral is defined as maintaining incentives for investors to exploit minerals. Therefore, the revenues must exceed the costs. Furthermore, the government must be able to rely on the amount of tax money it receives, therefore, the tax imposed must be as certain and as steady as possible. Often, governments decide to use a combination of different taxes, where one of them is a Pigovian tax, or a similar tax, to reach an \\"efficient outcome\\" by maintaining incentives for firms and representing public interests in keeping a certain share of minerals. Mineral taxes vary by country. They vary not only in height, but also in the amount of taxes on minerals imposed. In the US for example the most common tax in the mining industry is the property tax on mining. Furthermore, there are different rules and taxes in different states.  Various mineral taxes  For the government, the objective is to reach an ‚Äúefficient outcome‚Äù. There are various possibilities of taxing minerals. All imposable mineral taxes fulfil different purposes, and there is an ongoing scientific process about which tax shall be imposed why and when. = Profits tax = The profits tax is imposed on the profits of a firm. In general, this doesn‚Äôt change the behaviour of the firm, because they still want to maximize their profits. Since the tax due increases with increasing profits, this is a progressive tax. However, in the field of mining, it is difficult to implement this tax, since it is problematic to compute economic depreciation, e.g.: ‚Äúthe treatment of depletion allowances and exploration‚Äù The profits tax is a direct tax. = Resource rent tax = To tax the net present value of a firm in the mining industry, a resource rent tax is used. This tax will only be paid by firms with a positive Cash Flow. For firms with a negative cash flow, the government will choose an interest rate until the cumulative net cash flow turns positive again. Then a flat rate tax is applied, and the accumulated negative cash flows will be taxed. Under two assumptions regarding the interest rate and the cash flow, this tax has no impact on the firms‚Äô allocative decision. As the profits tax, the resource rent tax is direct tax. = Royalty tax = The royalty tax is an indirect tax, and has been historically the most important mineral tax. When the production starts, the tax is due. That generates up- front revenues for the government. A different approach of the royalty tax is, to impose it as a factor payment for extraction of minerals. If royalty taxes are very high, it might influence the production, because it gets too expensive for the firms to produce and extract minerals. = Brown tax = The Brown tax taxes the cash flow by using a flat rate tax. If a Brown tax is used, firms with a negative cash flows receive subsidies from the government. This is the difference to the resource rent tax, and leads to the fact that the government doesn‚Äôt have to choose a certain interest rate. It fulfils the neutral criteria of the tax, but tax revenues are not as certain as possible, since firms‚Äô cash flows are not always forecastable. = Franchise tax = The franchise tax has the same characteristics as a static analysed Lump-sum tax. Therefore, the tax doesn‚Äôt change the allocative decisions of the firms. = Taxes on output = Fixed payments per unit of gross output are the signature of taxes on output. There are mainly two different types on taxes of output, specific and Ad valorem tax. = Property tax = Under the property tax, the mineral reserves at the end of each period are taxed. This tax can be imposed on e.g. the net present value. This tax induces faster extraction since this the base of the tax declines over time. Therefore, the mineral reserves increase.  Environmental concerns and mineral tax  The extraction of minerals, and therefore the cumulative extraction leads to environmental damage. Thus, a conflict of interests between environmentalists, governments and firms exists. Since different taxes cause different strategies of firms, the protection of the environment is an important part of taxing minerals. Some taxes, as the property tax, increase extraction, which leads to environmental externalities. One of the goals of mineral taxing is therefore to internalize externalities by imposing the right tax.

Piano Sonata No. 1 in C minor, Op. posth. 4  Chopin composed this piano sonata in 1828, when he was still studying with J√≥zef Elsner, to whom the sonata was dedicated. Despite having a low opus number, this work was published posthumously in 1851 by Tobias Haslinger's son. This work is among the least recorded of all Chopin's works. = Movements = This sonata has four movements. #Allegro maestoso #Menuetto #Larghetto #Finale: Presto  Piano Sonata No. 2 in B-flat minor, Op. 35  Chopin composed this sonata, popularly known as the ‚ÄúFuneral March,‚Äù in 1839 at Nohant, near Ch√¢teauroux in France.

The $22-million ride was built and designed mostly in-house, a rare move for an amusement park, and opened to the public on July 2, 2015. It features the tallest beyond-vertical drop in the world among roller coasters. History Nearly 75% of Cannibal was designed, engineered, and manufactured in-house by Lagoon amusement park with the help of multiple firms located in Utah. The lead designer was Lagoon's Dal Freeman. In an era when most amusement parks outsource the work to companies, the decision to build in-house is rare in the industry. The roller coaster features a enclosed tower, a beyond-vertical drop of 116 degrees, a themed underground tunnel, and a 360-degree helix situated above a man-made waterfall. It also features four inversions that include a Immelman loop, a dive loop, and a unique inversion the park calls the \\"Lagoon roll,\\" which consists of a counter-clockwise heartline roll immediately followed by a clockwise heartline roll. The trains, which use only lap bar restraints, travel up to and pull as much as 4.2 G's. The ride had been in the planning stages for more than five years and required more than two years to build. Prior to its planned opening in the spring of 2015, Lagoon announced that the roller coaster's debut would be postponed for additional testing and inspections. The ride officially opened on July 2, 2015. Ride experience The roller coaster features a elevator lift, enclosed in a huge tower structure; a 116¬∞ beyond vertical drop; inversions, including an Immelman-like loop, as well as an inversion unique to the park consisting of two consecutive heart line rolls in opposite directions; a water feature; and a tunnel underground. It is the tallest roller coaster in the state and the longest ride in the park. The ride cars accommodate 12 passengers (3 rows of 4), and the duration of the ride lasts approximately two and a half minutes.

He was one of the first settlers of Fox Lake, Wisconsin, and served a single two-year term (1860‚Äì61) representing Dodge County in the Wisconsin State Senate.State of Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau. \\"Members of the Wisconsin Legislature 1848-1999\\". Information Bulletin 99-1 (September 1999), p. 6. Biography Born in Penobscot, Maine, he was descended from the Clan Fergusson, through his Scottish immigrant father, William Ferguson. Benjamin Ferguson moved to the Wisconsin Territory in 1844 and became one of the first settlers at Fox Lake, building the first frame house in the village. He established a farm on much of the land that later became the village of Fox Lake, and engaged in farming for most of the rest of his life. Ferguson's first attempt at public office was in 1847, when he was nominated for Sheriff of Dodge County. He lost that election, but was elected on his second attempt, serving from 1852 to 1854. In 1857, he was the Democratic candidate for Wisconsin State Senate in the 22nd District, but was defeated by Republican future-Governor William E. Smith. In January of 1858, Ferguson became Postmaster of Dodge County, and held that office until November of 1859. On May 4 1858, Fox Lake officially incorporated as a village. In April 1859, Ferguson was elected the second Village President, defeating William E. Smith in that election. Later that year, he again challenged Smith over his seat in the Wisconsin State Senate. This time Ferguson prevailed, and served as Dodge County's representative in the Senate for the 1860 and 1861 sessions. In April 1861, Ferguson was again elected Village President. He was elected again in 1862, 1876, and 1878. He also served as Fox Lake's representative on the Dodge County Board of Supervisors for 1861, 1870, 1871, and 1872, and was Chairman of the County Board in 1878 and 1879. In the 1861 election, Ferguson was the Democratic Party's nominee for Governor of Wisconsin. He was defeated by Republican Louis P. Harvey. Family and personal life In 1848, Benjamin Ferguson married Phoebe Ann Green, the widow of David Green. Mr. and Mrs. Ferguson had four children, but only one survived infancy.

She lives and works in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. In 1991, Lovely painted the official portrait of former First Lady Barbara Bush that now hangs in the George Bush Presidential Library and Museum. She has been called \\"the grand dame of Boston painters\\". Early life and education Lovely was born in Vermont, her mother an artist and her father an engineer. She had four siblings, all brothers. Her interest in art began at age four when a toy nursing kit lost its novelty. Her mother did not replace the candy pills that came with the kit, but did replace her crayons. Growing up, there were always craft supplies around the house and a sense that making was better than buying. Lovely's father attended both Dartmouth and MIT and her grandfathers attended the University of Vermont and Harvard. Despite struggling with dyslexia, she attended college at the University of Vermont, where she was drawn to the world of American Impressionism after a professor discussed Winslow Homer and announced that \\"no one is taught how to paint anymore\\". She graduated from the university with a bachelor's degree in art and a fifth-year teaching certificate. In 1980, she began studying at The Boston School with master artists including Robert Cormier and Paul Ingbretson at Fenway Studios. Lovely lives and works in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. Classification Among authorities in the art world, Lovely's work is labeled as Contemporary American Impressionism. She claims that learning to combine Neoclassicism with Impressionism at the Boston School forced her to base her work on quality drawing, sensitivity to value, and finally adding the gently abstracted feel of impressionism. Work Lovely's work is done on a variety of subject matter including Boston, ballet, beach scenes, the Lowcountry, Kennebunkport, Nantucket, Martha's Vineyard, Vermont, and much more. Playing with Fire continues to be one of her most popular paintings, depicting a boy lighting sparks on the beach, the ocean just feet away. Arlington Street Showers is one of her best-selling works, which shows a rainy, recognizable Boston streetscape. The colors in Arlington Street Showers are a bit darker than most of Lovely's work, which may account for the painting's standing out from the crowd. Candace Lovely and Barbara Bush in the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden Candace Lovely and President George H.W. Bush = Portrait of Barbara Bush = Candace Lovely, President George H.W. Bush, and Barbara Bush In the summer of 1991, Candace was invited to paint the portrait of First Lady Barbara Bush. While painting commissioned portraits of children in Kennebunkport, Maine, Candace reached out to the Bush family, who also had a home in Kennebunkport, about the possibility of painting their grandchildren. Mrs. Bush responded and Candace was invited to the White House for five days in the summer of 1991. Unable to choose which of her grandchildren to include in the portrait, Mrs. Bush decided, \\"I want my pearls and Millie in the painting,\\" with Millie being the Bushes' pet English Springer Spaniel. Candace and Mrs. Bush would exchange notes for years thereafter. =Political= The most controversial of her political pieces is Good and Plenty Kiss, which is Lovely's version of the Confederate flag. The piece can be shocking whether because this flag is viewed as a symbol of slavery or as a symbol of Southern love. When asked if her flags still represent love and joy, like she notes all of her paintings to do, she said, \\"But it still turned out pink. It's nectar and peaches and sweet honey. It's the good things of the South,\\" and ‚ÄúIf we can think of these symbols as hugs and kisses, dress them in candy colors, then they become far gentler.\\" File:Companions in the Garden .jpgCompanions in the Garden, 1991 File:Arlington Street Showers.jpgArlington Street Showers, September 1983, Oil on Linen, 26x35in File:Playing with Fire - Candace Whittemore Lovely.jpgPlaying with Fire, 1987, Oin on Linen, 35x27in File:Candace Whittemore Lovely - Good and Plenty Hug.jpgGood and Plenty Hug, 2001, Oil on Linen, 38x50in Evaluation and influence Christopher A. Faris told the Manchester Journal in 2005, \\"Candace Whittemore Lovely's oil paintings are exquisitely, touchingly, and masterfully executed and simply should not be missed by any lover of great art.\\" Lovely received strong criticism from locals for displaying publicly a piece depicting a naked woman dancing on a table in front of several men. In a letter to the local paper, a concerned citizen wrote, \\"Shocked that a public library would blatantly display such pornographic and degrading material, I spoke to a librarian, who ... defended this 'view of society.'\\" The citizen also noted that by placing this painting in a public library, innocent children are encouraged that it is normal and acceptable. Recognition Lovely received the Copley Master Award in 1988 from The Copley Society of Boston. Other awards include a Woman in the Arts Recognition Award from the Daughters of the American Revolution in March 2012, a Lifetime Achievement Award from Delta Delta Delta sorority in 2006, and inclusion in the 1995-96 International Charter Edition of \\"Who's Who in Creativity\\" from The World Forum on Creativity in Washington, DC.

History The clay pits on the Humber foreshore were the focus of a tile and cement industry from 1850 to 1959. The industrial sites were abandoned in the early 20th century once supplies of clay began to run out. The clay workings filled with water and became colonised by species of reeds. The reserve was acquired by Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust in 1983, who opened it in the same year. The site was designed as a national nature reserve in April 2005.

History  Captain C.C.Johnson, officiating as constructing engineer of railways in 1858 forwarded the proposal for a railway to be constructed and called it the Southern Mahratta Railway. The Southern Mahratta Railway company was formed on 1 June 1882 with its headquarters at Dharwar. Southern Mahratta Railway's first line was a metre gauge line of 40.5 mile long from Bellary to Hospet. This line was opened for traffic on 24 March 1884. In 1886 the Mysore State Railway's management was also taken by the Southern Mahratta Railway company. In 1888, a line was extended from Londa towards Portuguese Goa where it connected with the Marmagao line at Castle Rock. In 1889-90 the Southern Mahratta Railway company constructed the first coast to coast line from Marmagoa to Beswada.

Now part of the holdings of Peter Tamm's Tamm Media, it is one of the oldest German publishers still existing. History The publishing house was founded in 1789 by Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Dieterici in Berlin. As the business owner he had no male descendant, so the company took the name of his printer's son, Ernst Siegfried Mittler. Later, the family obtained the special privileges of the Prussian royal house. The publishing and printing house became one of the largest publishing houses in Germany and occupied a staff of several hundred people in the nineteenth century. The catalog of the publisher extended from school books to scientific publications, mainly in the areas of history, philosophy, literature, statistics, directories, atlases and scientific publications. E.S. Mittler und Sohn thus became the main publishing house for military history and literature, and printed the instructions and journals of the armed forces. Although this part of the production of the publisher made less than half of the publications, the company's success was closely tied to the political development of Germany. The house continues to publish books of military history, national security policy and works of contemporary industrial technology. The house is headquartered in Hamburg, also the current location of the holding company, which is owned by Peter Tamm. Sources This article is translated from the German Wikipedia article :de:E.S.

Pence became the subject of a fake biography titled Hannah: From Dachau to the Olympics and Beyond published in 2005. Her fabrications, which included fake Jewish background (as Hannah), were discovered in 2009. By 2012 she was wanted in Colorado's Boulder County on an arrest warrant for the theft of more than $20,000 and check fraud. Claims Pence claimed that as a three year old she was taken from her family of German Jews and deported to the Dachau Concentration Camp during World War II. While at the camp, she was the subject of medical experimentation and starvation before being freed by American forces. After liberation, she went to live in a convent with nuns who taught her how to ski. Using those skiing skills, Pence claimed that she competed on Germany's 1956 Olympic ski team in the 1956 Winter Olympics. Other claims included living in a kibbutz in Israel, her fighter pilot husband being shot down during the Vietnam War, \\"a scare during the 1972 Olympics, an audience with the Pope, an encounter with Ronald Reagan at the Berlin Wall and an airplane hijacking by a Palestinian terrorist.\\" She also claimed that she was to be awarded an honorary degree by the University of Oklahoma by her \\"old friend, the Queen of the Netherlands.\\" Building on her claims, Pence earned speaking fees at schools and other organizations because of her incredible life stories. One such school was the University of Colorado, where Pence led a seminar called \\"A Horrifying Experience.\\" It was revealed that her husband Wayne Pence, who had supposedly been shot down during the war, was actually living in another state and had been searching for their son Brian that Pence took from him when Brian was still a toddler. Rosemarie had made an engraved headstone for her husband to corroborate her story, even though the Air Force master sergeant was alive. He stated that Pence suffers from schizophrenia and had been institutionalized in the 1960s. He also stated that Rosemarie was indeed ethnically German, but that she had no Jewish ancestry. Messinger's biography of Pence Jean Goodwin Messinger, a local Colorado author, wrote a biography on Pence in 2005. The book was titled Hannah: From Dachau to the Olympics and Beyond. Messinger failed to investigate the claims that Pence made, however, and took Pence's stories at face value. When information came out that Pence had lied and the biography was then fictional, Messinger stated, \\"I was terribly embarrassed. Not only for me, but for everyone else touched by this.\\" Messinger continued with \\"I regarded this woman as a sister for the years I have known her. This revelation is shocking and disappointing to all of us who knew her and loved her, and counted her as a trusted friend.\\" Criminal charges A woman in Boulder, Colorado, loaned Pence over $70,000. When confronted about the money, Pence wrote her a $200,000 check to cover the loans, interest and time, but the check bounced as Pence was unable to cover the funds. Longmont residents David and Deena Kicera let Pence move in with them during 2009 and supported her. David was a police officer and Deena owned a small Christian bookstore. Pence had asked Deena to carry her biography in the store, and the two struck up a friendship and Pence eventually moved into their home. After living with the couple for almost a year, when they questioned Pence about the stories, she fled their home and moved to Butte, Montana where she began working at a Super 8 Motel. The Boulder County authorities did not seek extradition to Colorado for Pence because of the associated cost, but if she returns to Colorado she will be arrested. She is wanted for felony theft and check fraud.

Sciammarella In the last decade he has extended his pioneering developments in moir√©,Sciammarella, Cesar (1982). The moir√© method‚ÄîA review, Experimental Mechanics, Volume 22, Issue 11, p. 418-433. holography, and speckle interferometrySciammarella, Cesar (2002). Optics and Lasers in Engineering 40, Heisenberg principle applied to the analysis of speckle interferometry fringes methodologies down to the nanometric level.Sciammarella, Cesar (2007). Experimental Analysis of Nano and Engineering Materials and Structures, Observation of Fundamental Variables of Optical Techniques in the Nanometric Range, p. 363-364. These efforts have resulted in the field of optics to go beyond the classical Rayleigh limit reaching the nanometer range and in the electron microscopy to resolutions of the order of atomic distances. His fundamental research is widely used for 3D reconstruction, and stress and strain analysis. In his Doctoral Thesis on the Moir√© method he extended the Continuum Mechanics model originally developed by Dantu to large deformations. He developed fundamental equations on the properties of moir√© fringes, signs conventions. Furthermore, he applied the moir√© method to the solution of a plasticity problem, this was the first complete analysis of a non elastic problem with the moir√© method. Dr. Sciammarella generalized the concept of fringe order in methods that measure displacements using Fourier analysis in the process of formation of the fringe images. He proved formally that the orders could be represented by real numbers instead of integers as it was usual at the time of his publication.Basic Optical Law in the Interpretation of the Moir√© Patterns Applied to the Analysis of Strains. Experimental Mechanics, 1965. In 1966, he presented a full model of the moir√© fringes as phase modulated signals and provided a method to obtain displacements and strains for moir√© and photo-elastic fringes. He introduced for the first time in the literature the Fourier method as a tool for fringe pattern analysis. His model stands today as a standard model used in the fringe analysis methodology.Substantial Improvements in the Processing of Moir√© Data by Optical and Digital Filtering‚Äù, Proceedings of the Third International Congress of Experimental Stress Analysis, West Berlin, March 1966, VDI Berichte, N 102, 1966. Education * Diploma in Civil Engineering University of Buenos Aires, July 1950 * Ph.D., Illinois Institute of Technology, June 1960 Cesar Sciammarella received his diploma in Civil Engineering from the University of Buenos Aires in July 1950. After graduation he worked as a professional engineer in different industries and in different capacities including the Director of the Materials Testing Laboratories in the Metallurgy and Materials Division of the Atomic Energy Commission of Argentina. Later he was invited by Dr. A.J. Durelli to come to the US to get a PhD degree under Dr, Durelli's direction. He received his Ph.D., from the Illinois Institute of Technology in June 1960. Upon graduation he returned to the Argentine Atomic Energy Commission. Biography, professional life and work From 1952-57 Cesar was Professor of Physics at Argentine Army Engineering School. This was a period in Argentina under the democrat voted Juan Domingo Per√≥n. The 1955 under the dictatorship of general Aramburu coup that brought down Per√≥n's difficult republic was aided by officers from Argentine Army Engineering School. Although Cesar was not involved in the coup he was detained and tortured by the uprising at the age of 25. Peron's government fell two weeks after his detention and he was able to escape during the confusion. He spent several months fighting pneumonia caused by his detention. In 1962 he was invited to be Associate professor at the University of Florida, Gainesville. This is where he did some of his pioneering work on using the Moir√© method and the Fourier method to analyze the contours and deformations of bodies. In 1967 he became professor at the Department of Aerospace and Applied Mechanics, Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn. It was during this period Cesar Sciammarella pioneered digital analysis of moir√© fringes with the use of computers.C. Sciammarella, Automatic Data Retrieval and Data Processing Applied to fringe patterns utilized in experimental stress analysis‚Äù, presented in the seminar-in-depth pattern recognition studies, U.S.A. Army Material Command, Pattern Recognition Society, Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers, June 9‚Äì10, 1969, Published in the Seminar proceedings. In 1985, he further developed this methodology by putting together an optical and a computer system for fringe pattern analysis.C. Sciammarella, An Optoelectronic System for Fringe Pattern Analysis. Proceedings of the 1985 SEM Spring Conference on Experimental Mechanics, June 1985. Later he published a series papers answering the fundamental question of how far is it possible to recover fringe order information utilizing computer analysis. This work culminated in the paper Heisenberg Principle Applied to the Analysis of Speckle Interferometry Fringes. Heisenberg Principle Applied to the Analysis of Speckle Interferometry Fringes. Optics and Lasers in Engineering, 2003. Since 2005 Dr. Sciammarella has worked in cutting edge optical technology to go beyond the Rayleigh limit that traditionally has been considered as the maximum resolution that could be obtained in optics in far field observations. With the support of his co-workers he has succeeded in overcoming the Rayleigh limit. In recent work measurements in the far field have been carried out in nano crystals and nano spheres with accuracies on the order of ¬±3.3 nm.The equivalent of Fourier Holography at the nano-scale, Experimental Mechanics, 2008‚ÄúExperimental mechanics at the nanometric level‚Äù.

The generator delivers current once the engine starts and part of it goes to a second Startix solenoid that switches off the current from battery to starter. If the engine and generator stop, then that second solenoid switches on the current from the battery to the starter.Automatic Starter Relay, p 248, MotorBoating, February 1934, Vol. 53, No. 2, ISSN 1531-2623, New York There are many further refinements associated with the plain relay. Market It was marketed in the 1930s particularly for cars with then fashionable free- wheel manual transmissions but carburation problems led to automobile manufacturers soon dropping them as original equipment. They continued as an aftermarket accessory for cars with automatic transmissions into the middle years of the 20th century. =Free-wheeling= In the absence of a complete lock-up of the transmission of power between engine and wheels a car engine might die while idling. Even on a gentle long descent the driver might be unaware of engine failure until power was required and it could be dangerous particularly if braking-assistance depended on the engine and the reservoir or reserves proved inadequate. =False sense of security= Poorly adjusted engines could easily flood with fuel when attempting to restart while coasting and become unusable until dried out. Fuel management has since become so sophisticated this ceased to be a problem with the introduction of high quality fuel injection systems. =Automatic transmission= There was the appeal of the \\"power everything\\" car which automatically started its engine.

Although discovered in 1908, its scientific importance came into light in the late 1960s when it attracted scientists by the recurrent red colouration it caused by forming massive blooms, that cause red tides in the oceans. Unlike typical protozoans, M. rubrum can make its own nutrition by photosynthesis. The unusual autotrophic property was discovered in 2006 when genetic sequencing revealed that the photosynthesising organelles, plastids, were derived from the principal food of the ciliate, the photosynthetic algae called cryptomonads (or cryptophytes). It is, thus, both autotrophic and heterotrophic. This nature also indicates that it is an example of endosymbiosis, supporting the endosymbiotic theory, as well as the concept of stealing of cell organelles called kleptoplastidy. Moreover, M. rubrum represents additional endosymbiosis by transferring its plastids to its predators, the dinoflagellate planktons belonging to the genus Dinophysis. In 2009, a new species of Gram-negative bacteria called Maritalea myrionectae was discovered from a cell culture of M. rubrum.  Description  M. rubrum is a free-living marine ciliate. It is reddish in colour and form dark-red mass during blooming. Its body is almost spherical, looking like a miniature sunflower with its radiating hair-like cilia on its body surface. It measures up to 100 Œºm in length and 75 Œºm in width. The body is superficially divided into two lobes due to formation of a constriction at the centre. The constriction gives rise to a larger anterior lobe and a smaller posterior lobe. The cilia arise from the constriction. Using the cilia it can jump about 10-20 times its body length in one movement. Its nucleus is prominently situated at the centre, and is surrounded by organelles mostly derived from algae. For example, its cytoplasm contains numerous plastids, mitochondria and other nuclei. These organelles are properly separated such that the mitochondria are fully enclosed in a vacuole membrane and two endoplasmic reticulum membranes of the ciliate. This indicates that the ciliate is primarily a heterotroph, but after acquiring algal plastid, it transforms into an autotroph. = The endosymbiont = Genetic analysis showed that in the American coastal areas, the primary food of M. rubrum is the algae most closely related to the free-living Geminigera cryophila. But in Japanese coasts, the major algal species is Teleaulax amphioxeia. When these plastid-containing algae are ingested by the ciliate, they are not digested. The plastids remain functional and provide nutrition to the ciliate by photosynthesis. In order for the plastids to be normally active, they still require enzymes, which are synthesised by the sequestered algal nuclei. The single nucleus can survive and remain genetically active up to 30 days in the cytoplasm of the ciliate. As the retention time of the prey nuclei is short, an average M. rubrum cell may contain eight algal plastids per single prey nucleus and the nuclei need to be replaced by continuous feeding on fresh algae. Thus, the algal organelles are not permanently integrated.

It was owned by the Nizam of Hyderabad and Tata Airlines. History Founded in 1945, it was one of the nine airlines existing in India during independence. The airline was a joint venture of Nizam Government of erstwhile Hyderabad State and Tata Airlines. 71 per cent of Deccan Airways was owned by the Nizam's Government and the rest was owned by Tata Sons and others. Commercial operations were launched with a fleet of three aircraft in July 1946, operating a twice weekly service between Madras and Delhi, with halts at Hyderabad, Nagpur, Bhopal and Gwalior. It also flew a twice weekly Hyderabad-Bangalore flight. By March 1947, the airline had seven aircraft in its fleet and was operating the Madras- Delhi flight daily as well as a daily Hyderabad - Bombay flight. Between July 1946, and May 1947, the airline had carried more than Eleven thousand passengers, apart from 51 tonnes of freight, and almost seven tonnes of mail. The seventh Nizam, Mir Osman Ali Khan, along with some aides takes his first ride in a Deccan Airways Dakota from Begumpet airport Post-Annexation After Operation Polo for annexing Hyderabad State, the airline ownership changed to Government of India. By 1952 Government of India held 78% of shares of Deccan Airways. The shares were acquired from the Hyderabad Government & Nizam State Railways. 13% of the shares was still held by Tatas & 9% by the general public Nationalization In 1953 Deccan Airways Limited along with seven other airlines under the Air Corporations Act were merged to form a single domestic carrier, Indian Airlines. After this on 10 October 1953, Deccan Airways resigned its associate membership of IATA. Fleet By the time it was merged with Indian Airlines in 1953, it had a fleet of thirteen Douglas DC-3 'Dakota' aircraft. The DC-3 aircraft were brought from US Air Force at a throw away price after they were left unused at Assam after World War 2.

Its name stems from the fact that it can be seen as a procedure which \\"merges\\" all the variables into one, preserving at least some of the entropy contained in the uniformly random variable. Mergers are currently used in order to explicitly construct randomness extractors. Intuition and definition Consider a set of k random variables, X_1,\\\\ldots,X_k, each distributed over \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^n at least one of which is uniformly random; but it is not known which one. Furthermore, the variables may be arbitrarily correlated: they may be functions of one another, they may be constant, and so on. However, since at least one of them is uniform, the set as a whole contains at least n bits of entropy. The job of the merger is to output a new random variable, also distributed over \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^n, that retains as much of that entropy as possible. Ideally, if it were known which of the variables is uniform, it could be used as the output, but that information is not known. The idea behind mergers is that by using a small additional random seed, it is possible to get a good result even without knowing which one is the uniform variable. Definition (merger): A function M : (\\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^n)^k \\\\times \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^d \\\\rightarrow \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^n is called an (m,\\\\varepsilon)-merger if for every set of random variables (X_1,\\\\ldots,X_k) distributed over \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^n, at least one of which is uniform, the distribution of Z = M(X_1,\\\\ldots,X_k, U_d) has smooth min-entropy H_\\\\infty^\\\\varepsilon(Z) \\\\geq m. The variable U_d denotes the uniform distribution over d bits, and represents a truly random seed. In other words, by using a small uniform seed of length d, the merger returns a string which is \\\\varepsilon-close to having at least m min-entropy; this means that its statistical distance from a string with m min-entropy is no larger than \\\\varepsilon. Reminder: There are several notions of measuring the randomness of a distribution; the min-entropy of a random variable Z is defined as the largest k such that the most probable value of Z occurs with probability no more than 2^{-k}. The min-entropy of a string is an upper bound to the amount of randomness that can be extracted from it. Section 2.2. =Parameters= There are three parameters to optimize when building mergers: # The output's min-entropy m should be as high as possible, for then more bits can be extracted from it. # \\\\varepsilon should be as small as possible, for then after applying an extractor to the merger's output, the result will be closer to uniform. # The seed length d should be as small as possible, for then the merger requires fewer initial truly random bits to work. Explicit constructions for mergers are known with relatively good parameters. For example, Dvir and Wigderson's construction gives: For every \\\\alpha > 0 and integer n, if k \\\\leq 2^{o(n)}, there exists an explicit (m,\\\\varepsilon)-merger M : (\\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^n)^k \\\\times \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^d \\\\rightarrow \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^n such that: # m = (1-\\\\alpha)n, # d = O(\\\\log(n) + \\\\log(k)), # \\\\varepsilon = O\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{n \\\\cdot k}\\\\right). The proof is constructive and allows building such a merger in polynomial time in the given parameters. Usage It is possible to use mergers in order to produce randomness extractors with good parameters. Recall that an extractor is a function which takes a random variable that has high min-entropy, and returns a smaller random variable, but one that is close to uniform. An arbitrary min-entropy extractor can be obtained using the following merger-based scheme: Section 4.3. * Given a source of high min- entropy, partition it into blocks. By a known result, Phd. Thesis. at least one of these partitions will also have high min-entropy as a block-source. * Apply a block extractor separately to all the blocks. This is a weaker sort of extractor, and good constructions for it are known. Since at least one of the blocks has high min-entropy, at least one of the outputs is very close to uniform. * Use the merger to combine all the previous outputs into one string. If a good merger is used, then the resultant string will have very high min- entropy compared to its length. * Use a known extractor that works only for very high min-entropy sources to extract the randomness. The essence of the scheme above is to use the merger in order to transform a string with arbitrary min-entropy into a smaller string, while not losing a lot of min- entropy in the process. This new string has very high min-entropy compared to its length, and it's then possible to use older, known, extractors which only work for those type of strings.

Between its Short Narrative Program and Vidz 4 Kidz Short Documentary Program, Make a Film Foundation has created over 100 short films. These films have screened at various film festivals and won many awards.  History  Make a Film Foundation grants film wishes to children all over the United States, and was started in the fall of 2005, after the founder, Tamika Lamison received a six- figure payment for her script \\"The Jar by the Door\\". This windfall let the founder to pursue her lifelong passions for teaching, mentoring, and film making.  Funding and financial stewardship  Ninety percent of Make a Film Foundation's budget is supplied by donations that go directly to programming. Revenue breakdown between 2006 and 2013 were as follows: 75% contributions, 20% special events, and 5% \\"other\\", according to IRS 990 annual reports.  Programs  = Short Narrative Program = A child or teenager who suffers from a serious or life-threatening medical condition has the opportunity, with the help of industry mentors, to write and star in their own short film. They star in the film with well-known actors, and a noted director directs the piece. These films are professional-quality Hollywood shorts, and generally play in festivals all over the US and internationally and have won numerous awards. The quality and authenticity of each film causes the budget per film to range anywhere from US$50,000 to $100,000. All cast and crew participate on a volunteer basis, with shooting taking place over the course of a weekend. The film is then edited, and screened at a red-carpet event in Hollywood in a major theatre as well as premiering in a theatre in the hometown of the authoring child or teenager. The short films include: \\"The Magic Bracelet\\" Written by Rina Goldberg, whose dream was to see her script turned into a short film, and who died due to mitochondrial disease in December 2010. Her final words to her mother were, \\"Promise you'll take care of my film.\\" Her script was then adapted into a short film by Academy Award- winning writer Diablo Cody (Juno). Jon Poll (director of Charlie Bartlett and co-producer of Meet the Fockers) directed. The film stars Bailee Madison (Parental Guidance, Just Go with It); Hailee Steinfeld (Academy Award- nominated in the 2010 remake of True Grit); Jackson Rathbone (Twilight film franchise); JK Simmons (Juno, Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films); James Van Der Beek (Don't Trust the B---- in Apartment 23, Dawson's Creek).

It has been requested by festivals all over the US.  \\"Deep Blue Breath\\"  Written by Clay Beabout, an 11-year-old boy with what then called VATER syndrome (today VACTERL association) who has survived over 40 surgeries. Beabout starred in the film with Sean Astin (Lord of the Rings), Miguel Sandoval (Medium), Natasha Gregson Wagner (High Fidelity) and Ernie Hudson (Ghostbusters). It was directed by Patricia Cardoso (Real Women Have Curves). The film is half animation and half live-action, and is about a boy who travels deep inside his body to an animated dream world where he engages in battle against the evil Lord Vater ‚Äì a monstrous manifestation of his disease, and a play on Darth Vader.

The Government of India honoured her, in 2012, with the Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian award, for her services to the field of art and culture. Biography Guruvayoor Kesavan's Statue at Guruvayur. Pepita Seth taking photograph Pepita Seth was born in Suffolk, East of England, UK, in a family of farmers. Pepita's maternal great grandfather was a soldier who served in the army in the British India. As was the custom during those days, Pepita, being a girl, did not have any formal education. She, choosing a career in films, studied film editing and got opportunities to work under film directors like Ted Kotcheff and Stanley Donen. However, Pepita's life took a turn when she chanced upon the diary of her grandfather and decided to trace his trails with the British Army and document the movements and landed in Kolkata, in 1970. The journey from Kolkata ended in Guruvayur where she became fascinated by the temple arts and rituals of Kerala. For the next nine years, she visited Kerala several times and, in 1979, she found a home and settled in Guruvayur. Though, at first, she was denied entry to the Guruvayur Temple, her persistence made the Guruvayur Devaswom Board to relent and she remains the only foreigner to be granted entry to the Temple. Pepita was married to the Indian born British actor Roshan Seth but was estranged from her husband in the late 80s. The couple formally divorced in 2004. Pepita Seth has extensively covered the rituals and temples of Kerala through her photographs. Her photographs of the elephant, Guruvayur Keshavan have been published in many magazines and journals including the New York Times and the Guardian. It is generally considered that Pepita's photographs of the rituals and temple arts of Kerala have helped promote the image of Kerala as a tourist destination. Pepita Seth lives in Guruvayur. Books and articles Pepita Seth has authored two books on Kerala, with accounts and photographs. Heaven on Earth: The Universe of Kerala‚Äôs Guruvayur Temple is a research study on the Guruvayur Temple and the life, traditions, beliefs, myths and rituals associated with the place. It also covers the elephants fostered by the temple, especially Guruvayur Keshavan, widely regarded as the most famous of them all. The book follows an account with photographs style and has represented the information gathered from various sources, including the priests at the temple. The book is regarded as the first such attempt on the Guruvayur Temple. It consists of 17 chapters and 215 images and covers the history of the 5000-year-old idol, made out of black bismuth, of the temple, and the rituals and poojas, in detail. * The Divine Frenzy ‚Äì Hindu Myths and Rituals of Kerala is an account of the spiritual and practical relationship of the people of Kerala with the deities. It attempts to depict, with text and images, the various rituals associated with Hinduism in Kerala. * Pepita Seth has written extensively about Kerala, its rituals and its elephants.

It is in the heart of Pasar Kliwon district and is known as the Arab quarter of Surakarta. Many of the mosques in this village have different architecture than those located elsewhere in Surakarta. In earlier times, Pasar Kliwon was also the residence of clerks of Surakarta Sunanate. The clerks used a different style of Javanese script, called Pasar Kliwonan script. History The word Kliwon is originated from the name of the fifth-day in 5-day calendar system in javanese tradition, while Pasar is originally from word Bazaar which means a market in Indonesian language. ). The market used to be crowded and busy every Kliwon day. According to one story, the market was initially known as the cattle market, especially for trading goats and sheep but transformed to a general market emphasizing in textile-related businesses. During East Indies ruling in nineteenth century, Arab immigrants, mostly Hadhrami people were categorized as East Foreigners within the colonial social structure through Stelsel Wijken (Districts system) policy. The population was required to live in a special determined area and was led by a captain appointed by the government. The aim was to make them less harmful and easily supervised by the Dutch government that fear of Islam and Arab descents. The Dutch government decided to put the Arab immigrants in Pasar Kliwon area. The economic foundation of these Hadhrami immigrants is formed by production and distribution of textile, mainly batik, sarong and kain tenun (woven fabrics). They also produce and sell prayer caps (songkok, taqiyah), tasbih, and other accessories for prayers. The population of Arab-Indonesians in Pasar Kliwon is 24.6% of total population in the village, which is the densest within the city of Surakarta. 95.8% of the residents are Muslims. Some of Javanese call these Arab- Indonesians Encik, which originally a greeting to young women in Malay language but means \\"Boss\\" according to the local terminology (because many of them are successful in business and being employers of the indigenous Javanese). The word later considered scornful by the Arab-Indonesians of Surakarta. Almost all are adherents to Shafi'i Madhab and many are of Ba'alawiya, except a handful minority who adhere to shiism, Salafism or Wahhabism. There is also a handful minority population of Indian and Pakistani descent in Pasar Kliwon, for example Abdullah Tufail, a Pakistani who founded Majelis Ta'lim Al-Qur'an (MTA) in 1972 in Pasar Kliwon. Some of known figures grown up in the area, among others, are Haidar Bagir (businessman, scholar), his maternal uncle Abdillah Thoha (a politician and businessman; cofounder of National Mandate Party), and Anis bin Hadi (businessman). Many of the residents go to Diponegoro (formerly al-Rabithah) school, an offshoot of Jamiat Kheir school, sometime in their life. Pasar Kliwon is also known as the place where the commander of Cakrabirawa Lieutenant Colonel Untung Syamsuri grew up. Untung was one of the persons responsible in the 30 September Movement Coup d'etat. Untung's father, Abdullah, was a worker at Batik equipment store in Pasar Kliwon. He went to an elementary school in Ketelan in Banjarsari, another sub-district not too far from Pasar Kliwon. It is also the place where an Economic scholar, a Pluralist and an activist with the Liberal Islamic Network (Jaringan Islam Liberal, JIL) Dawam Raharjo grew up. Gurawan Region in Pasar Kliwon always looks different every 20th of Rabi' al-thani of Islamic calendar, especially at al-Riyadh mosque, where thousands of visitors and guests from different regions across the country flock to the mosque to participate in the Khaul ceremony commemorating the great scholar Habib Ali bin Muhammad al-Habshi who died on 20th Rabi' al-Thani and is buried in Seiyun, Hadhramaut. Habib Ali is known for his Islamic preaching and also as the author of Simthud Durar, the Mawlid book of the praises and poetry tribute to Prophet Muhammad. The book containing the story of the birth, nature, morality, and the history of the Prophet is used across the country and recited during various Mawlid events. The khaul is performed in Indonesia (Pasar Kliwon) because Habib Alwi bin Ali Al-Habshi which is Habib Ali's son, was the first to perform Mawlid of Habib Ali bin Muhammad al-Habshi in Surakarta. He was also the founder of the al-Riyadh Mosque in Pasar Kliwon, which he named it after the mosque in Seiyun built by his father. During the mawlid, the book Simthud Durar is recited and after the Khaul ceremony has been performed, the organizer provides special Nasi Kebuli (a mixed variation of Mandi food and Kabuli Palaw) banquet as tradition of Pasar Kliwon which is always awaited and sought after by visitors.

Plot During the early 1970s, the ICAC has not been established in Hong Kong yet and the city was swamped with corruption and widespread poverty. Police sergeant Wong Yat-chung (Ti Lung) is very upright and justice and refuses to partake with his corrupt colleagues and thus, he is marginalized from everyone else at the police station. During an operation, Wong's subordinate Sam Mok (Simon Yam) shoots Wong in the back heavily injuring him. Meanwhile, Governor Murray MacLehose delegates Sir Barry Drainage to investigate the corruption happening in Hong Kong. Drainage's assistant Annie Ma (Maggie Cheung) also enlists Wong for help. After investigating, Wong discovers that Mok was forced to shoot him earlier.

The Baan Stage gave a platform for development of the Socio-Cultural scene of Assam. The great cultural trio Rupkonwar Jyoti Prasad Agarwala, Kalaguru Bishnu Prasad Rabha and Nata Surya Phani Sarma blossomed here. Phani Sarma along with Bishnu Rabha directed the most successful Assamese movie Siraj. The Baan Stage (old) was constructed on the same plot of land donated to the Oxomiya Bhaxa Unnati Xadhini Xobha and with the donation from the public. Jyoti Prasad wrote several successful dramas which were played in the Ban Stage. Padmanath Gohain Baruah, Dandinath Kalita, Phani Sarma also wrote a number of successful plays for staging them in the Baan Stage. The tradition of staging dramas at the Baan Stage continuous till today. History Baan Theatre, an institution of excellence in performing arts and cultural, dates back to 1906 and is now about to become 100 years old. The Baan Theater has a glorious and long history. Before going into it we have to go back few years for the circumstances that lead to its birth. It is an accepted fact that the modern drama movement in Assam was started just after first freedom struggle i.e. in 1857 (popularly known as Sepoi Mutiny). The play by Historian Late Gunabhiram Baruah's \\"Ram Nabami Nat\\", which was first published as serial in ‚ÄòArunodai‚Äô from 1857 and published as book later in 1867 is the considered as the first step of this movement. Up to 1906, the establishment year of famous \\"BAAN THEATRE\\", different writer wrote at least 25 Dramas and these were performed in their respective places. At Tezpur, this drama movement was closely associated with the famous \\"Asomiya Bhashar Unnati Sadhini Sabha\\" Tezpur Branch estd. 1890 and \\"Tezpur Armature Theater Party\\" estd. 1895. \\"Tezpur Armature Theater Party\\" had both Assamese and Bengali members, however due to an incident in 1903 Assamese Members get away from that organization, and decided to form a theater party under \\"Asomiya Bhashar Unnati Sadhini Sabha\\", which was later known as \\"Baan Theatre\\". \\"Baan Theatre\\" was situated at Kolibari up to 1958. A devastating storm in 1953 and the availability of land in centralized location of the town led general body to decide shifting the premise to the present location in 1955 and constructed up to a usable level in 1958. Throughout its thick and thin, since its establishment 100 years ago, Baan Theatre has relentlessly pursued the policy of upgrading new and traditional creative art forms, broadening audience involvement and access and improving the livelihood of artists and opportunity to contribute to civic life. Ban Theatre is proud of producing most talented people like ‚ÄòRupkowar‚Äô Jyotiprasad Agarwala, the doyen of Assamese art & culture, The pioneer in producing, directing, scoring music in the first Assamese film ever made viz. Jaimati, depicting the values and sacrifice of a woman revolting against a tyrannical ruler; ‚ÄòKalaguru‚Äô Bishnuprasad Rava, a revolutionary poet, lyricist, dancer, music composer and artist etc.; ‚ÄòNatasurya‚Äô Phani Sharma, the play writer and famous actor in stage and screen; Dada Saheb Phalke Award Winner, \\"Roving Minstrel\\" Dr. Bhupen Hazarika, the internationally known music maestro, producer, director, music scorer in number of award-winning films; ‚ÄòMancha-Kowar‚Äô Chandradhar Goswami etc. to name few. In the entire N. E. Region of the country, Baan Theatre, named after King Baan, the legendary ruler of Tezpur, occupies a unique position. In this long period of 100 years, it has successfully strengthened the bond of unity among the people of different cast and creed. Baan Theatre believes that the pursuit for excellence should be made a national motto ‚Äì people should create new benchmarks of excellence and break new grounds of opportunities for various sections of society. With this end in view Baan Theatre is striving hard to achieve its objective of increasing opportunities for cultural and artistic expression for people of all backgrounds. With new ideas, new technique it has brought laurels through its theatrical performances at the State and National level. The Natasurya Drama Festival, in the memory of Late Phani Sharma, is being regularly held every year since 1971 from 31 July to 4 August. The sole objective of this festival is to produce new dramas and new artist. It has already stage more than 100 dramas. With donation and contribution from various public sector undertakings, voluntary organisations and individuals a huge theatre hall with a seating capacity of 900 persons has already been completed. The acoustic treatment of interior decoration of the auditorium with most modern folding cushioned chair was done at a huge cost. But so far stage and modern lighting equipment, musical instruments are concerned- much is yet to be done.

The Act was amended by the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Act 2015.  Access to telecommunications data under the Act  Under the 1979 Act, the Australian Security and Intelligence Organization (ASIO) and ‚Äòenforcement agencies‚Äô can access telecommunications data by issuing an internal, or intra-organization, authorization. During the 2012- 2013 inquiry into Australia‚Äôs national security legislation conducted by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security (PJCIS), the Attorney General‚Äôs Department issued a document detailing what it considered to be telecommunications data. This included \\"information that allowed a communication to occur\\", such as the date, time and duration of the communication, the devices involved in the communication and the location of those devices such as mobile phone tower and \\"information about the parties to the communication\\", such as their names and addresses. Section 5 of the Act defines an enforcement agency to include the Australian Federal Police (AFP), the police force of a State or Territory, the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, crime commissions, anti-corruption bodies and the CrimTrac Agency. The definition also includes an allowance enabling organizations whose remit either involves the administration of law involving a financial penalty or the administration of a law to protect taxation revenue to access telecommunications data. The head of an enforcement agency, the deputy head of an agency or a management level officer or employee of an agency, given permission in writing by the head of the agency, have the power to authorize access to telecommunications data.

It is believed to be a former Native American village that was discovered in 1542 by Juan Rodr√≠guez Cabrillo. Historically known as Syujtun, it was also visited and documented by Juan Cresp√≠, Gaspar de Portol√†, and eventually Don Lu√≠s Burton, the latter who purchased the property in 1860. The California Department of Parks and Recreation has acknowledged that Burton Mound has \\"yielded some of the most important archeological evidence found in California\\". History As of 1782, the area known as Burton Mound was \\"one of the largest Chumash villages on the South Coast.\\" The village, then called Syujtun, or Syuxtun, was visited by Gaspar de Portol√† around August 1769. Portol√†'s party stated that the village was the largest out of all they visited up to that point, and that at least 600 people lived there. A party member stated: \\"In no other place had we met natives so affectionate and good natured.\\" The entire village had disappeared by the early 1830s. By 1800, there were about 120 people living there. Most of the Chumash had died from Spanish introduced diseases or become \\"members\\" of Mission Santa Barbara. A large building was built on site, which stored hide made from cattle. The property was bought by Joseph John Chapman in 1833. He was a former employee of Hippolyte Bouchard. Chapman helped construct Mission San Gabriel Arc√°ngel. In 1860, the property was purchased by Lewis T. Burton. Burton became a major figure in Santa Barbara, opening a series of businesses in the town, including a post office, general store, and orchards. He died in 1879. In January 1903, the property became integrated into the Potter Hotel, a luxury hotel with 600 rooms. In April 1921, the hotel was destroyed in a fire. It was not rebuilt. At this time, the property became a curious factor for archaeologists. John P. Harrington was in charge of excavating the property on behalf of the Smithsonian Institution. He started the excavation in the spring of 1923 and over 2,500 objects were uncovered by the end of summer that year. The objects from that excavation reside in the National Museum of the American Indian. Today Today, the site is located near West Beach. It is located on Burton Drive. The property comprises commercial and residential businesses. On July 12, 1939 it was named a California Historical Landmark.

Peter Muller-Munk Associates (known as PMMA) was an American industrial-design firm that flourished in Pittsburgh under the direction of its charismatic name partner. PMMA's work touched almost every aspect of industrial design and were especially influential in the realm of consumer goods. Notably, U.S. Steel hired PMMA to work on the general aesthetic design for the Unisphere, the theme center of the 1964 New York World's Fair.  Peter Muller-Munk  The company's founder was born Klaus-Peter Wilhelm M√ºller\\"M√ºller-Munk, Peter\\" in Byars, Mel (2004). The Design Encyclopedia, New York: The Museum of Modern Art, pp. 516-517. on June 25, 1904, in a wealthy suburb of Berlin, in present-day Germany. He began his career crafting unique and custom silver objects before turning to industrial design. He emigrated to the United States in 1926 and launched his career as a metalworker at Tiffany & Co. in New York City. He moved to Pittsburgh in 1935 to accept a job at the Carnegie Institute of Technology as assistant professor in the first American university baccalaureate degree program in industrial design. .Delphia, Rachel; Stern, Jewel; Walworth, Catherine (2015). Silver to Steel: The Modern Designs of Peter Muller-Munk. Prestel Publishing. p. 142 .  History  In 1938 he opened his first consulting office in Pittsburgh with Robert Paul Karlen as his first employee. Clients had so expanded by 1945 that he found it necessary to resign from Carnegie Tech to devote himself to his business. At the time, he began operating under the name Peter Muller-Munk Associates with Karlen and Raymond Smith as associates. Anton Parisson became the fifth partner in 1957. In 1956 Ernst Budke became an associate of the firm. By 1960 there were five partners and six associates. PMMA's client list spanned the globe; local ones included the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company, Westinghouse, and U.S. Steel.Delphia, Rachel; Stern, Jewel; Walworth, Catherine (2015). Silver to Steel: The Modern Designs of Peter Muller-Munk. Prestel Publishing. p. 142 . After the death of its founder in 1967, PMMA continued to take work aligned with its expertise. Projects included vehicle design, a corporate identity for the new Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh and a series of unique, eye- catching trolleys as a publicity campaign for Pittsburgh's Port Authority Transit (PAT) (now Port Authority of Allegheny County). Despite these successes, PMMA struggled in the years following Muller-Munk's death. By 1973, staff had been reduced to two officers and 20 employees. To adapt to the changing marketplace, PMMA management decided to merge with Wilbur Smith Associates (now CDM Smith) on January 1, 1974, rendering Peter Muller-Munk Associates a division of WSA.Delphia, Rachel; Stern, Jewel; Walworth, Catherine (2015). Silver to Steel: The Modern Designs of Peter Muller-Munk. Prestel Publishing. p. 150-156. .  Legacy  Despite Muller-Munk's own commercial success and his pioneering efforts to establish industrial design as a serious course of post-secondary study, PMMA's profile declined and almost disappeared into the history of modern design. Recently, interested in the firm's work has grown. In 2015 the Carnegie Museum of Art organized a monographic exhibition dedicated to the designer and his work, with the aim of supplementing design histories that traditionally focused almost exclusively on the American East and West Coasts.Delphia, Rachel; Stern, Jewel; Walworth, Catherine (2015).

The 1927 season was Dan McGugin's 23rd year as head coach. Running back Jimmy Armistead led the nation in scoring in 1927 with 138 points. The team's quarterback was Bill Spears. One fellow wrote Vanderbilt produced \\"almost certainly the legit top Heisman candidate in Spears, if there had been a Heisman Trophy to award in 1927.\\" Schedule Season summary =Chattanooga= Vanderbilt started the season with a 45‚Äì18 victory over Chattanooga. =Ouachita= In the second week of play, Ouachita was defeated 39‚Äì10. =Centre= Vanderbilt overwhelmed Centre 53‚Äì6. =Texas= In Dallas, the Commodores suffered the season's only loss to Texas Longhorns 13-6\\\\. Texas scored on a 20-yard pass from Baldwin to Ford, and on a run from Baldwin. Vanderbilt's lone score came on a 16-yard pass to Owens. Spears fought three Texans as he threw the pass. The starting lineup was Kelly (left end), Lusky (left tackle), Cecil (left guard), V. Sharpe (center), Oliver (right guard), Abernathy (right tackle), Creson (right end), Spears (quarterback), McIlwain (left halfback), Owen (right halfback), Armistead (fullback). =Tulane= Bernie Bierman thought of ditching his single-wingback formation after the 32-0 win over Tulane, and was convinced to keep it by McGugin. The starting lineup was Abernathy (left end), Hawkins (left tackle), Kelly (left guard), V. Sharpe (center), Cecil (right guard), Lusky (right tackle), Creson (right end), Spears (quarterback), Owen (left halfback), McIlwain (right halfback), Armistead (fullback). =Kentucky= Kentucky was beaten 34‚Äì6 . The starting lineup was James (left end), Hawkins (left tackle), Kelly (left guard), Oliver (center), Cecil (right guard), Lusky (right tackle), Creson (right end), Spears (quarterback), Owen (left halfback), McIlwain (right halfback), Armistead (fullback). =Georgia Tech= A wet field and a strong defense, ranked by one researcher as best in the South, helped Georgia Tech reassert itself and hold Vanderbilt to a scoreless tie, despite the Commodores having the upper hand in play. A strong game had been predicted, showcasing each team's backfield stars in Stumpy Thomason of Tech and Bill Spears of Vanderbilt. Vernon Sharpe suffered a knee injury before the game. The starting lineup was Abernathy (left end), Hawkins (left tackle), Kelly (left guard), V. Sharpe (center), Cecil (right guard), Lusky (right tackle), Creson (right end), Spears (quarterback), Owen (left halfback), McIlwain (right halfback), Armistead (fullback) =Tennessee= Robert Neyland was hired to coach Tennessee in 1926 by Nathan Dougherty with the explicit goal to \\"even the score with Vanderbilt\\", and had his first great team in 1927. McGugin's Commodores led 7-0 until a late Dick Dodson run tied the score. \\"After the game McGugin questioned each of his players as to his whereabouts during the run. Without exception the players claimed that two men had blocked them. McGugin shrugged. \\"Well, we'll just protest the play. It's perfectly obvious that Tennessee had twenty-two men on the field.\\" Vanderbilt center Vernon Sharpe arguably had the better season, but was outperformed by Tennessee's Elvin Butcher. The starting lineup was Abernathy (left end), Hawkins (left tackle), James (left guard), V. Sharpe (center), Cecil (right guard), Lusky (right tackle), Creson (right end), Spears (quarterback), Owen (left halfback), McIlwain (right halfback), Armistead (fullback). =Maryland= Spears played only in the first half in the 39-20 win over Maryland, but completed 10 of 12 passes. =Sewanee= Vanderbilt defeated Sewanee 26-6\\\\. The starting lineup was Abernathy (left end), Hawkins (left tackle), Oliver (left guard), V. Sharpe (center), Cecil (right guard), Lusky (right tackle), Creson (right end), Owen (quarterback), McIlwain (left halfback), Sims (right halfback), Armistead (fullback). =Alabama= The Commodores faced Wallace Wade's Alabama Crimson Tide in the season finale. Spears gained more than the entire Alabama backfield as the Commodores won 14-7.http://grfx.cstv.com/schools/alab/graphics/docs/27-m-footbl-recaps.pdf The highlight of Vanderbilt's first scoring drive was a pass from Spears to Armistead of 20 yards, down to the 3-yard line, from which Armistead later ran it in. On Alabama's scoring drive, Red Brown ran 23 yards on a reverse, down to the 4-yard line. Tony Holm eventually got the score. In the fourth quarter, Spears led the winning drive, once circling end for 34 yards, tackling by Starling just as he seemed to break free. He then passed to Larry Creson for 10 yards, ran for 6, and then 13 more around end to the 16-yard line. After Spears and Armistead worked it down to the 9-yard line, a pass to Roy Gibson got the touchdown. Postseason Spears passed for 1,207 yards and 9 touchdowns.

A fictionalized version of her life was documented in the 1977 film The Turning Point, in which she was portrayed by Shirley MacLaine, who was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance. Personal life She was born in New York City, United States, the daughter of Jewish-Russian immigrant parents Sonia and Alexander \\"Sasha\\" Mirrow (1893‚Äì1977). She married dancer Kelly Kingman Brown (1928‚Äì1981) and had four children, dancers Leslie Browne and Elizabeth, and sons Kelly Brown II, a film producer, and Ethan Brown, who was a soloist dancer with ABT until 2004. Kelly Brown was from Mississippi and started dancing at a young age, his mother Sue was a dance instructor. He later moved to Chicago to train at the Stone-Camryn School of Ballet. He then moved to New York City to dance with ABT, where he met Isabel. At ABT he worked with Agnes de Mille. Her husband, Kelly Brown, also was a featured dancer in several Hollywood musical films, including Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, Daddy Long Legs, The Girl Most Likely, and Oklahoma!. On Broadway he was the dance captain for I Can Get It for You Wholesale which starred Barbra Streisand. Nora Kaye, Arthur Laurents, and Herbert Ross also worked on that show and would later collaborate on The Turning Point. In the 1960s after Kelly and Isabel had aged out of being principal dancers, they moved to Phoenix, Arizona to operate a dance studio. When their daughters auditioned for School of American Ballet in New York, Leslie was chosen, and her sister Elizabeth a year later. The move to Arizona caused a strain in the marriage when Isabel became homesick for her native New York. They divorced a year later and Isabel moved back to New York to watch over her daughters who had begun training there. Career Mirrow was a principal dancer with the American Ballet Theatre in New York City from 1947 until 1953. Some of her peers she danced with during this time include Svetlana Beriosova, Tamara Toumanova, and Irina Baronova. In 1945, she danced in the Broadway musical The Day Before Spring. She later became a dance mentor for many aspiring dancers and worked with Finis Jhung's Ballet Company. The Turning Point Mirrow was childhood friends with the ballerina Nora Kaye. Their parents had immigrated from Russia to New York City at the same time and lived in the same brownstone apartment building. Kaye was later married to film director Herbert Ross. Nora Kaye was the godmother of the Brown's eldest daughter Leslie, born in 1957. In the 1970s, a script by Arthur Laurents was developed based on the Brown Family. Shirley Maclaine was cast to play Isabel and originally, the dancer Gelsey Kirkland was cast to play Leslie. Kirkland dropped out of the film due to substance abuse problems, and Ross cast Leslie believing she would be able to portray a fictionalized version of herself in the film. The film was directed by Herbert Ross and produced by Ross and Kaye. Released in 1977, The Turning Point was nominated for eleven Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Her daughter Leslie Browne (at age 20) was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and Shirley MacLaine was nominated for playing Leslie's mother. The family name was changed to \\"Rodgers\\" for the film. Her daughter Leslie Browne had added an \\"e\\" to her name for her stage name, believing it sounded more feminine after being mistaken as male in a playbill. Her other daughter, Elizabeth (Brown) Healy (born 1959), was portrayed in the film by Lisa Lucas with her name changed to \\"Janina.\\" References External links * Category:1928 births Category:2014 deaths Category:American ballerinas Category:Prima ballerinas Category:Dancers from New York (state) ","title":"Isabel Mirrow Brown"},{"id":"43634860","text":"The Almont League is a high school athletic conference in Los Angeles County, California, USA, which includes six high schools, three from the Alhambra Unified School District and three from the Montebello Unified School District affiliated with the CIF Southern Section.

Other major operators include Busways, Transdev NSW and Transit Systems Sydney. Most services are provided as part of the city's integrated public transport system, with routes, fares, service levels, fleet specifications and customer service standards determined by Transport for NSW. A small number of services operate outside of this network. History Until the 1990s all of Sydney's private bus services were run by family owned companies. The Passenger Transport Act 1990 requiring average fleet ages to be maintained at no more than 12 years and minimum service levels, resulted in many of the smaller operators selling out to larger operators. But even these larger operators such as Baxter's, Busways, North & Western, Shorelink, South Trans, Transit First and Westbus, were still owned by Australian families. In the late 1990s and early 2000s multi-national transport operators including Connex, ComfortDelGro, National Express and Transdev began to buy up some of these larger operators. In March 2004 the Minister for Transport released the final report of Barrie Unsworth's Review of Bus Services in NSW.Annual Report 30 June 2004 Transport NSW At that stage Sydney's bus operating contracts were divided into 87 contract areas.

The park is located between boulevard Kellermann, the rue de la Poterne-des-Peupliers, and rue Max-Jacob. The nearest metro station to the park is Porte-d'Italie. History The art moderne entrance to the park The park was built on the former bed of the Bi√®vre river, a tributary of the Seine which was covered over in the 20th century. In 1937, the future park was the site of several pavilions of the 1937 Paris Exposition whose main site was at the Place du Trocad√©ro. Following the exposition, the chief architect of the Exposition, Jacques Gr√©ber, transformed it into a public park. Gr√©ber had an international reputation as a landscape architect; he also designed the Fairmount Parkway, now the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, in Philadelphia. The park contains pieces of architecture and sculpture from the era of the Exposition, unfortunately deteriorated from their original state.Jarrass√©, Dominque, \\"Grammaire des jardins Parisiens, p. 193-195. Features of the park The park occupies an area of 5.5 hectares, and has two different parts in two different styles; the upper park, which is in the art moderne landscape style of the 1930s; and the lower park, along the riverbed, in the more picturesque style of Napoleon III. The entrance to the upper park, on boulevard Kellermann, has an art moderne colonnade, made of cement and bricks and decorated with bas-reliefs of dancers and athletes by √âlie Ottary. The entrance leads to a wide alley, bordered by rows of tilia, or linden trees, with a large lawn between, and an art moderne pavilion. The upper level has a fine view over the trees of the lower park and the city, but also overlooks the Peripherique highway, whose noise carries to the park. A short stream runs from the upper level through pools and a cascade of artificial rocks to the lower park, where it enters large kidney-shaped basin with a fountain The eastern side of the lower park is the most forested and natural, while the western part is devoted to playgrounds and sports.Jarrass√©, Dominique, Grammaire des jardins Parisiens, p. 193-195.

Origins The party was founded in 1965 by Kamal Chatila and Najah Wakim. Chatila was the general secretary of the party. The party represented a right- wing tendency in the Lebanese Nasserist movement. Najah Wakim was elected to parliament in 1972, making him the sole Nasserist deputy. The UWPF in the Lebanese Civil War In the early phase of the Lebanese Civil War the UWPF maintained a 1,000-man strong militia, the Victory Divisions (Arabic: Firqat an-Nasr), which fought alongside the Lebanese National Movement (LNM) militias in the Beirut area. However, in late March 1976 the UWPF left the LNM to enter the pro-Syrian Front of Patriotic and National Parties (FPNP) alliance, and supported the June 1976 Syrian intervention in Lebanon, which caused a rift between them and the other Nasserist groups. From June to November 1976 the UWPF and its militia faced onslaughts by Fatah and the other LNM militias. There was also a splinter group of the party, the Union of Working People's Forces-Corrective Movement (UWPF-CM) led by Issam Al-Arab.

The song was considered a turning point in Kannada cinema and took Dr. Rajkumar's image to new heights. In the song, the narrator asserts pride in being a Kannadiga. The chorus runs: :: :: :: :: ::If you want to be born, take birth in the Kannada land; ::If you want to step on, step on the Kannada soil; ::This life is like a landaus (horse chariot); ::Chariot that drives forward our fate.

There are four members of the lectican family: aggrecan, brevican, neurocan, and versican. Lecticans interact with hyaluronic acid and tenascin-R to form a ternary complex.  Tissue distribution  Aggrecan is a major component of extracellular matrix in cartilage whereas versican is widely expressed in a number of connective tissues including those in vascular smooth muscle, skin epithelial cells, and the cells of central and peripheral nervous system. The expression of neurocan and brevican is largely restricted to neural tissues.  Structure  All four lecticans contain an N-terminal globular domain (G1 domain) that in turn contains an immunoglobulin V-set domain and a Link domain that binds hyaluronic acid; a long extended central domain (CS) that is modified with covalently attached sulfated glycosaminoglycan chains, and a C-terminal globular domain (G3 domain) containing of one or more EGF repeats, a C-type lectin domain and a CRP-like domain.

leading into the Zwinger in Carcassonne. Right: the lower Zwinger wall. Example of a Zwinger: the Minneburg in the Odenwald The Zwinger around Coburg Fortress reinforced by early modern era bastions A Zwinger () is an open kill zone area between two defensive walls that is used for defensive purposes.Piper, Otto: Burgenkunde. Bauwesen und Geschichte der Burgen. W√ºrzburg, 1995, p. 684. Zwingers were built in the post-classical and early modern periods to improve the defence of castles and town walls. The term is German and usually left untranslated. However, it is sometimes rendered as \\"outer courtyard\\" presumably referring to the subsequent role of a Zwinger as a castle's defences became redundant and it was converted into a palace or schloss, however, this belies its original purpose as a form of killing ground for the defence. The word is linked with zwingen, \\"to force\\", perhaps because the Zwinger forced an enemy to negotiate it before assaulting the main defensive line. Essenwein states that the \\"main purpose of this feature was so that the besieging force could not reach the actual castle wall very easily with battering rams or belfries, but had to stop at the lower, outer wall; also that two ranks of archers, behind and above one another, could fire upon the approaching enemy\\"von Essenwein, \\"Kriegsbauk\\", p. 192, in Otto Piper, Burgenkunde: Bauwesen und Geschichte der Burgen innerhalb des deutschen Sprachgebiets, Hamburg: Severus (2014), reprint of 1905 edition, p. 11, .  Castles  The Zwinger of a castle is sited in front of the main curtain wall and is enclosed on the outer side by a second, lower wall, known as the Zwinger wall (Zwingermauer). If attackers succeed in getting past the Zwinger wall, they would be trapped in the Zwinger and were an easy target for the defenders on the main wall (Hauptmauer). Further progress was thus seriously impeded. In central Europe most Zwingers were built in front of older castle walls as a later addition and reinforcement of the defences.  Town fortifications  The Zwinger in front of a town gate is a fortified area between the main gate and the outer gate of a medieval town gateway system. Town gates were often built in the shape of a gate tower, with a second, and sometimes even a third, gate in front of it (so-called double or triple gate systems). In front of the town walls in the area of the town gates there was usually a second wall in which the outer gate was located. An enemy who had breached the outer gate and penetrated the Zwinger would find himself in an enclosed area with very little scope to exploit his initial success. By contrast, the defenders retreating behind the main town walls could easily engage the enemy below them in the killing ground of the Zwinger. The barbican is based on a similar concept to the gateway Zwinger and is found in front of the main wall but separated from it by an additional moat. In the Hussite period (around 1420/30) impressive examples were built that were mainly intended as protection against early firearms. The open area of the Zwinger was mainly used in peacetime to keep animals or as a garden. As their defensive function became superfluous, in many cases barns, stables and storage buildings were erected in Zwingers. The Zwinger at Dresden inherited its name from the old Zwinger in front of the Crown Gate (Kronentor) on the outer wall of the fortress. It was never intended as a fortification, however, but was conceived as the outer courtyard of a new palace.  Development  Part view of the Theodosian Wall of the former city of Constantinople. In the foreground: the double Zwinger. The development of the Zwinger has not been well researched to date. By the fifth century A.D. a fully developed Zwinger had been built in front of the Byzantine walls of Constantinople. In early medieval fortifications, too, a succession of defensive walls can be seen. Especially during the time of the Hungarian invasions, defensive castles were protected by berms and outer ramparts to guard against the cavalry attacks of the Magyars. These were not Zwingers in the true sense of the word; often an intermediate moat separated the lines of defence. Such a moat is also frequently part of late medieval Zwingers. Occasionally the narrow outworks of the Habsburg (Aargau) or of Alt-Bolanden (Rhineland-Palatinate), which date to the late 10th and early 11th centuries, are seen as early Zwingers. These fortification elements do not have any direct successors, however. In central Europe Zwingers first reappeared in the first half of the 13th century in front of the ring-walls of small fortifications. Towards the end of that century, the defensive capability of castles was being enhanced in this way far more frequently, for example at Gnandstein Castle in Saxony; Ch√¢teau du Landsberg and Ch√¢teau d'Andlau in Alsace. In southern France the heavily restored Zwinger in the town fortifications of Carcassonne appears to have been built. Initially Zwinger walls were very close to the main wall. In the 14th century, the first firearms caused a further growth in the number of Zwingers. Countless examples were built, especially during the 15th and 16th centuries. In Franconia the fortification of late medieval city has largely survived. In Nuremberg a low Zwinger was built in front of the older ring- wall. In the early 15th century, Munich was fitted with a new double ring of town walls, as depicted in the Nuremberg Chronicle. By connecting the inner and the outer ring - to be more exactly, the respective inner and outer (= lower) watch towers - with numerous party walls, a succession of zwinger segments soon encircled the place as a whole. The first Zwinger walls of the High Middle Ages were usually not protected by towers. The artillery fortifications of the Late Middle Ages, by contrast, were defended by numerous flanking and, sometimes also, battery towers or roundels. The Zwingers of a small group of castles in the Franconian Ha√überge date to the Hussite period. As elsewhere the territorial lords were reacting to the serious threat of rebels from nearby Bohemia. These Zwingers at the castles of Altenstein, Rauheneck and Schmachtenberg have been well preserved. At Rauheneck Castle the defences are further strengthened by two bret√®ches. These features and hoardings (Kampfh√§user) may also be seen as part of other Zwingers. The Hussite period additions of many castles in the endangered regions often went back to innovations that had been developed by the Hussites themselves. A prime example is the town fortification of the south Bohemian Hussite town of T√°bor. Parts of the Zwinger in front of the main gate have survived even today. In general the Zwinger walls were markedly lower and less thick that the actual ring walls. Often only a parapet wall was erected around the intended killing ground of the Zwinger. Occasionally a covered or open wall walk was built on the inside of the wall, as at Trausnitz Castle in Landshut. Even underground wall walks with embrasures for hand guns may be seen, for example, at Hochhaus Castle near N√∂rdlingen. Zwinger walls could fully surround a fortification or just a particularly vulnerable section. There is often a moat in front of them, the Zwinger wall also acting as the revetment of the moat. On hillside castles the Zwinger wall was a supporting wall and often very high to provide static stability of the whole site. Frequently, small, hidden sally ports or posterns enabled direct combat with an enemy in the moat area. The actual Zwinger area was also often accessible through sally ports.  Early high medieval Zwinger in the Holy Land  The Krak des Chevaliers with its extensive Zwinger system around the inner ward (artist's reconstruction from 1871) The Krak des Chevaliers of the Knights of St. John is generally classified as a crusader castle. Just before 1170 the first small Zwinger was built here around the inner ward. This surprisingly early Zwinger was replaced in the mid-13th century by the present outer fortification. This Zwinger is also one of the oldest examples of its type. A building inscription records that the castle governor, Nicolas Lorgne, had a barbacane built ‚Äì almost certainly a reference to the Zwinger. This source enables the second Zwinger of the Crac to be dated to around 1250. The Zwinger of the Krak des Chevaliers was extended in around 1270. Despite this reinforcement, the Muslims under Sultan Baibars I succeeded in capturing the fort in 1271, after just a four-week siege. Other large crusader castles were also surrounded by great Zwinger systems. The outer ring wall of the castle of Tartus (Syria) could have been built at the same time as the Zwinger at Krak, i.e. in the middle of the 13th century. By shortly before 1168 the Knights of St. John began remodelling Belvoir Castle in present-day Israel. The outer fortification with its corner towers acts like \\"a large Zwinger to the structure\\" (U. Gro√ümann).  13th-century double concentric walls in Wales  Castle site in Beaumaris The Welsh castles of Harlech and Beaumaris (started 1295 but never completed) have a double defensive wall, the outer wing surrounding the inner one concentrically at a short distance from it. The outer fortification in Beaumaris, with its round wall towers, is particularly massive and comparable to the Krak des Chevaliers.

An influential Marxist-feminist theoretician, she is recognised for being one of the main founders of the Social Reproduction Theory. She also participated in the civil rights and the women's liberation movements in organisations such as the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in Mississippi and Bread & Roses in Boston. In her earlier career as an art historian, she was one of the first to try to develop a feminist perspective on Art History. Biography Lise Vogel was born in New York City. Her father, Sidney Vogel, was a distinguished American doctor who volunteered during the Spanish Civil War on the side of the Spanish Republic between 1937 and 1939.Vogel, Lise. Sidney Vogel: Spanish Civil War Surgeon. In: American Journal of Public Health. Vol. 98, No. 12 (Dec., 2008); p. 2146-2149 Being raised in the United States in a left-wing family during the Cold War, she learned from a very young age to think critically and question the way society works. She received her A.B. degree from Radcliffe College in 1960 and then became a doctoral student in Art History at Harvard University. During her time in graduate school, she became involved in the anti-war and civil rights movements and she worked with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in Mississippi between 1964 and 1965. In the late 60's, she participated in the emerging women's liberation movement, taking the side of its socialist feminist wing, and joined the organization Bread & Roses in Boston. She finished her Ph.D. in Art History in 1968 and soon started to teach at Brown University. In her initial career as an art historian, she published The Column of Antoninus Pius as well as some of the first articles on feminist art history and women's history. She also taught courses on these topics, which was an innovation. In 1976, she started another doctorate at Brandeis University in Sociology, finishing in 1981, two years before publishing her most influential work: Marxism and the Oppression of Women: Toward a Unitary Theory. She taught sociology at Rider University until her retirement in 2003. Topics of research As an art historian, Lise Vogel conducted research on Roman Imperial relief sculpture in her first Ph.D., which was published in the monograph The Column of Antoninus PiusLeeb Hadzi, Martha. Review: The Column of Antoninus Pius by Lise Vogel. In: The Art Bulletin. Vol. 57, No. 1 (Mar., 1975), p. 123-125 and many articles. She also contributed to the newly developing feminist perspective on Art History. As she moved into the field of sociology, she studied the Marxist tradition in relation to the woman question, analyzing the most relevant texts as well as the evolution of the Marxist movement's positions on the woman question and identifying two contradictory legacies that had coexisted since the beginning of Marxism.Vogel, Lise. Marxism and the Oppression of Women: Toward a Unitary Theory. 2nd Ed. Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2013. 215 p. In addition, she participated in crucial debates within socialist feminism, such as the domestic labor debate and the issue of how to articulate Marxism and feminism. Both the research on the woman question traditions in Marxism and the analyses of socialist feminist work are discussed in the book Marxism and the Oppression of Women: Toward a Unitary Theory, first published in 1983. After the publication of Marxism and the Oppression of Women, she kept working on the development of Marxist-feminist theory, focusing on family, maternity, workplace and gender policies among other topics. She studied the current state of feminism, analyzing the debates between the equality and difference perspectives in relation to maternity leave and other public policies. Such research is mostly developed in her book Mothers on the Job: Maternity Policy in the U.S. Workplace (1993) as well as in numerous articles, some of them included in Woman Questions: Essays for a Materialist Feminism (1995). Contributions to Marxist-feminist theory =A unitary theory= Lise Vogel has put some light on the development of the Marxist thought on the woman question. As Johanna Brenner mentions, feminists ‚Äì including a great part of socialist feminists ‚Äì had commonly assumed that ‚Äúclassical Marxist theory had little to say about women's oppression, and the little it had to say was wrong‚Äù.Brenner, Johanna. Review: Marxist Theory and the Woman Question. In: Contemporary Sociology. Vol. 13, No. 6 (Nov., 1984); p. 698-700 This led to the adoption of a dual system theory by most socialist feminists with two parallel autonomous structures of oppression (patriarchy and capitalism), an approach in which Marxism, which could only explain class exploitation but not women's oppression, had to be combined with feminism, a necessary theory to explain the patriarchal oppression of women. One of the most paradigmatic and influential texts holding this approach was Heidi Hartmann‚Äôs article The Unhappy Marriage of Marxism and Feminism: Towards a More Progressive Union. Lise Vogel challenges this view in her book Marxism and the Oppression of Women as well as in other articles, defending a unitary perspective (she also has a text in response to Hartmann‚Äôs article in which she argues that there is no need for ‚Äúsome new synthesis between Marxism or socialism, and feminism. Rather, it is Marxist theory itself that must be developed, and socialist practice that must be transformed‚ÄùVogel, Lise. Marxism and Feminism: unhappy marriage, trial separation or something else? In: Women and Revolution. A discussion of the unhappy marriage of Marxism and Feminism. Edited By Lidia Sargent. Montr√©al: Black Rose Books, 1981; p. 195-219). =Marxist legacies on the woman question= In Marxism and the Oppression of Women, she reviews the most important texts of the Marxist woman question and identifies two legacies that have coexisted: the dual system perspective and the social reproduction perspective. The dual-system approach understands women's oppression as deriving from ‚Äútheir situation within an autonomous system of sex-divisions of labor and male supremacy‚Äù, viewing class and gender as two autonomous structures. Women's oppression and class-oppression are viewed as essentially independent and there is the implicit idea that two motors drive the development of history: class-struggle and sex-struggle. This dual character can be seen, for instance, in the commonly cited fragment from Engel's preface to the first edition of The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State: ‚ÄúAccording to the materialistic conception, the determining factor in history is, in the final instance, the production and reproduction of immediate life. This, again, is of a twofold character: on the one side, the production of the means of existence, of food, clothing and shelter and the tools necessary for that production; on the other side, the production of human beings themselves, the propagation of the species. The social organization under which the people of a particular historical epoch and a particular country live is determined by both kinds of production: by the stage of development of labour on the one hand and of the family on the other.‚ÄùEngels, Friedrich. Preface to the First Edition. In: The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State. London: Penguin Classics, 1972; p. 76-80 This legacy continued with the works of August Bebel, Eleanor Marx and Edward Aveling and has been inherited by the dual system socialist feminists. By contrast, Vogel argues that the social reproduction perspective comes from Marx's Capital, and consists on the idea that ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs oppression has its roots in women‚Äôs differential location within social reproduction as a whole‚Äù. According to this approach, class struggle would be the central dynamic of social development, and the major characteristic of a class society would still be the appropriation of surplus-labor by the dominant class. Nevertheless, this appropriation would require the constant renewal of the working class, including generational replacement, in which women play a vital role. Despite situating the roots for this perspective in Marx's Capital, it's important to remark that Marx doesn't talk about the position of women, nor does he mention domestic or reproductive labor, in the Capital‚Äôs section Simple reproduction, where the idea of social reproduction is presented. Yet, Marx introduces the eloquent idea that capitalist production needs the constant reproduction of the workers through the transformation of the means of subsistence into the labor power.Marx, Karl. El capital: Cr√≠tica de la econom√≠a pol√≠tica. Libro primero: El proceso de producci√≥n del capital. Madrid: Siglo XXI Espa√±a, 2017. 999p. Lise Vogel‚Äôs contribution is precisely to situate women‚Äôs oppression and domestic labor in this scheme, founding what would later be called the Social Reproduction Theory. However, she argues that some Marxists (she mentions Lenin and Clara Zetkin) had already conceived the woman question from the point of view of the reproduction of labor power. Therefore, this approach can also be considered a legacy from Marxism. The development of the social reproduction perspective (or the Social Reproduction Theory), can be considered Vogel‚Äôs major contribution to Marxist-feminist theory. =On the domestic labor debate= Regarding the domestic labor debate, Vogel conceptualizes domestic labor as the necessary labor that reproduces labor power. She points out that, as reproductive labor, it doesn‚Äôt produce surplus-value but only use-value. Therefore, it doesn‚Äôt fit into the Marxist category of productive labor. She argues that it should be situated in the Marxist category of necessary labor instead. In her own words: ‚ÄúDomestic labour is the portion of necessary labour that is performed outside the sphere of capitalist production. For the reproduction of labour-power to take place, both the domestic and the social components of necessary labour are required‚Äù. =On the debates between the equality and difference approach= With respect to the debates between the equality and difference approach and the United States gender policies, Vogel analyses the positions of each perspective and the policies supported on each side. On the one hand, the equality approach holds that men and women should be treated equally and, therefore, argues that maternity leave should be regulated as any other medical leave, claiming for a job-protected leave available for all temporally disabled workers. On the other hand, the difference approach affirms that special rights are required for women, including a specific protection in their maternity leave, in order to achieve real equality.Vogel, Lise. Debating difference: feminism, pregnancy, and the workplace. In: Feminist Studies. Vol. 16, No. 1 (Spring, 1990); p. 9-32 Vogel argues in favor of transcending this debate, proposing a gender neutrality perspective based on the concept of diversity that combines respect for differences with commitment to equality using gender-neutral legal rules.Spalter-Roth, Roberta. Review: Mothers on the Job: Maternity Policy in the U.S. Workplace by Lise Vogel. In: Gender and Society, Vol. 10, No. 1 (Feb., 1996); p. 100-102 The idea is that in a diverse society, in which different individuals or groups have special needs and responsibilities, equality is compatible with special accommodations,Fonow, Mary Margaret. Review: Woman Questions: Essays for a Materialist Feminism by Lise Vogel; Hatreds: Racialized and Sexualized Conflicts in the 21st Century by Zillah Einstein. In: Gender and Society, Vol. 11, No. 3 (Jun., 1997); p. 373-376 but this should not be reduced to gender difference. Impact and criticisms According to Ferguson and McNally, the only significant scholar response to the first edition of Marxism and the Oppression of Women, which is Lise Vogel's most important book, was written by the socialist feminist Johanna Brenner.Ferguson, Susan; McNally, David. Capital, Labour-Power, and Gender- Relations: Introduction to the Historical Materialism Edition of Marxism and the Oppression of Women. In: Marxism and the Oppression of Women: Toward a Unitary Theory by Lise Vogel. Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2013; p. XVIII-XL Brenner, while recognizing the value of Vogel's work, asserts that the social reproduction perspective fails to explain men's systematic resistance to equality and doesn't address the question of why the outcome of class struggle seems to almost universally result in a family system with men in power. She also remarks that her approach, to a certain degree, ignores the conflict between men and women's interests as well as the power relations between working-class men and women. Another author who criticized not specifically Vogel's work but the social reproduction approach is Himani Bannerji. Bannerji adverts that, due to its great influence from structuralism, this perspective is unable to understand the role of political subjectivity. What she means is that by paying attention to the existing structures of society, social reproduction feminists leave unexplored the processes through which these structures came to be the way they are, losing the sense of history. Moreover, she claims that due to their economistic reading of Marx's Capital and also as a result of their tendency to abstraction, marxist-feminists don't pay enough attention to race and ethnicity. They ignore ‚Äúthe specificity of differential exploitation that actually exists in an economic organization‚Äù and, she continues, ‚Äúnot even functionally [do] they apply the categories of ‚Äúrace‚Äù and ethnicity and attend to practices of racism to augment their understanding of capital‚Äù.Bannerji, Himani.

Since the publication of the second edition five years ago, Lise Vogel has been invited to give talks all over the world, the book has had many reviews, it had already been published in Turkish and Chinese but the second edition was also translated to German and Turkish and new translations are underway.VOGEL, Lise. \\"Marxism and the Oppression of Women\\" Talk in 8th Subversive Film Festival. Cinema Europa, Zagreb, 12th May 2015 from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJfV9I_dHVI&t;=610s According to Ferguson and McNally, if Vogel's work didn't initially get the attention it deserved is because it ‚Äúappeared at a moment of acute disarray for the socialist-feminist movement [‚Ä¶] [with] neoliberalism in the political sphere and postmodern theory in the intellectual realm‚Äù. In contrast, new anti- capitalist movements are emerging today and the interest on marxist theory is growing again at the moment. That is the reason why Marxism and the Oppression of Women has made an impact only after so many years. Bibliography =Books= * Marxism and the Oppression of Women: Toward a Unitary Theory.

When Sears purchased Kmart and moved its headquarters to Chicago in 2006, the building, then housing 2,000, was vacated; art from the corporate art collection including a tapestry by Picasso and a signed Warhol poster and exhibits from the science and technology collection including a work by Alan Bean signed by US astronauts were sold off.Associated Press, \\"At Kmart, the art is high-end: former headquarters sells off fine art\\", The Spokesman-Review June 21, 2006, pp. A8, A11. The 40-acre building is enclosed by nine towers, six smaller, two larger, and one overlooking the rest at the corner nearest the intersection of W. Big Beaver and Coolidge. The tallest tower offers a panoramic view of the surrounding area, including the adjacent Somerset Mall. The building was sold in December 2005 to Madison Marquette, a development company that planned to use the site for a hotel, condominiums, shopping, offices, and entertainment. It was sold in 2006 for US$40 million. In 2009 The Forbes Company & Frankel Associates, owners of the mall, purchased it from Diamond Troy JV, L.L.C. for an undisclosed price.Nancy Kaffer, \\"Former Kmart Corp. headquarters in Troy sold to Somerset owner\\", Crain's Detroit Business, January 6, 2010. Many people have since attempted to purchase the area from Forbes, but all have been unsuccessful. Forbes has said he is working with the city to decide how to develop the area. One idea was a project called the Pavilions of Troy, to tear down the old building and create an outside shopping mall.Terry Parris, Jr., \\"Pavillions of Troy breaking ground in former Kmart HQ\\", Development news, Metromode, May 29, 2008.

If the fortification is clearly higher than the walls it is called a battery tower.  Design  The design of a roundel, which was massive in comparison with a normal defensive tower, enabled the deployment of heavy cannon. Roundels were built of both earth and brickwork; in the latter case, vaulted rooms (casemates) were built on the inside.  History  = Emergence = Roundels appeared in the 15th century when cannon gradually developed into an effective siege weapon. Roundels are the oldest permanent artillery fortifications. Their heyday was in the 15th and early 16th centuries. Early examples of artillery roundels are in the town fortifications of T√°bor before 1433 and Sion Castle, that around 1426/27, and certainly before the siege of 1437 were modified. Other early central European examples that have survived include roundels at Sigmundskron Castle near Bozen (from 1473), at the Hessian water castle of Friedewald (from 1476), the neighbouring Herzberg (from 1477), Haut- K≈ìnigsbourg from 1479, Breuberg (around 1480), in Halle a. d. Saale (from 1484), in Burghausen a. d. Salzach (around 1488), Heidelberg Palace (around 1490/1500), or the southwest roundel of Marburg Castle (1522‚Äì23) and in the shape of the Fulda Roundel in front of Kassel Palace (1523). = Demise = Like the horseshoe-shaped bastion, the roundel has a so-called blind spot which makes it vulnerable. In addition, the upper level of a roundel had little space for heavy cannon. Even the casemates of a roundel could only house a few cannon because they created a lot of gunsmoke which only dispersed slowly. The roundel was a stage in the development of late medieval fortifications and did not meet the demands of defensive works of the early modern period. Even the construction of large and thick-walled roundels like those at Munot in Schaffhausen built from 1563 to 1585, were an insufficient response to the technology of the time. As a result of its disadvantages the roundel was replaced in many places during the 16th century by the acute- angled bastion with a pentangular ground plan based on Italian practice. In spite of the advantages of the angled bastion, various European fortresses continued to be protected by roundels until well into the 17th century, something that was partly due to the high cost of fortress construction. In addition, expertise on bastion design only spread very slowly across many parts of Europe. = Later design and re-emergence = For decades after the invention of the angled bastion, roundels were built, albeit now more often in combination with earthworks or rock and earth combinations (artillery ramparts) as part of a continuous main defensive line that gave greater protection from artillery fire. Examples of the more recent type are the two roundels (and connecting artillery ramparts on the west side of Heidelberg Castle (from c. 1526), the expansion of Celle's town fortifications (around 1530) (not preserved), the six roundels of the small town of Pfalzel an der Mosel (from 1532), the four artillery towers of Solothurn (from 1534), the three mre recent roundels of the Sparrenburg above Bielefeld (from 1535) and the roundel at the W√ºrttemberg state fortress of Hohentwiel (from 1538). Even the imperial city of Nuremberg built between 1527 and 1550 several smaller roundels and between 1556 and 1559 the four prominent round towers at the main gates as artillery platforms, as did the imperial town of Rothenburg ob der Tauber in 1572. Many fortresses consist entirely of interlinked roundels, for example Deal Castle on the south coast of England, the construction of which had been started in 1539. In the late 18th and 19th centuries, roundels came back into vogue due to changes in military technology.  Plassenburg example  View of the outer west roundel of the Plassenburg with gunports and the inner west roundel positioned within it. At the fortress of Plassenburg in Kulmbach there are two \\"staggered\\" roundels. One is a high, inner, roundel built within a much larger outer roundel. This construction is one of the largest surviving roundel works in Germany. The inner and outer roundels house two gun decks, which meant that a staggered roundel could generate a heavy weight of fire from four batteries. The fortress with its roundels was used by the army until the Napoleonic Wars in 1806. The two roundels in the west of the fortress were rebuilt after the place had been slighted in 1554 following the Second Margrave War, although by that time bastions had already superseded them. Subsequently, between 1557 and 1607, more bastions were added.  Literature  * Olaf Wagener, Thomas K√ºhtreiber: Taktik und Raum. Vorwerke als Elemente des Burgenbaus im 15. und 15.

Its site is now that of St John's Gardens, situated between Lower Byrom Street, Byrom Street and Quay Street. St John's Church was built in 1769 by Edward Byrom, a co-founder of the first bank in Manchester. Its parish encompassed a large and important section of the city of Manchester. The first rector, John Clowes, held the office for 62 years until his death in 1831. Clowes preached the first Sunday school sermon in the Manchester area, introduced Swedenborgianism there and was prominent in championing Whit Walks. Clowes was succeeded by William Huntington, who had held the post of curate since 1826 and continued as rector until his death in 1874. Huntington established the Sunday school, for which he laid the foundation stone in 1827. In 1906, around 250 children attended the Sunday school and the church had numerous affiliated groups, such as a Penny Bank and a Choral Society. By the early 1900s, the graveyard was overshadowed on its northern side by a warehouse built on the Quay Street site of the Byrom family residence, and with a declining congregation and some redundancy of provision given the nearby St Matthew's Church, the Manchester diocese decided to merge the parish of St John's with St Matthew's in 1927. As a result, the church was demolished in 1931. The church has been described as the first significant building in Manchester to be constructed in the Gothic Revival style of architecture. Construction of the tower, which contained a peal of eight bells manufactured by Lester and Pack, was completed in May 1770. The first restoration took place in 1821, including a re-roofing paid for by a daughter of Byrom. Between 1874 and 1878 work was done at a cost of ¬£1600 and in 1898 the lighting was converted from gas to electric. The church bells, which were described as \\"among the best peal of bells in Manchester\\", were rehung in 1832 and again around 1883. The roof collapsed in 1924 and was rebuilt by 1926. Among people who were commemorated in the church windows were John Owens, and Sir Thomas Bazley. Today the graveyard of the church is commemorated by a stone cross and a plaque states that more than 22,000 bodies lie buried in the vicinity. Among those buried in the churchyard are John Owens, the founder of Owens College, and William Marsden, who founded the concept of a half-day holiday on Saturdays.  Origins  The rapid population growth of Manchester during the mid-18th century saw a rising demand for more churches. St John's Church was built in 1769 by Edward Byrom (13 June 1724 ‚Äì 24 April 1773), a co- founder of the first bank in Manchester and the oldest surviving son of John Byrom, whose affluent family was well known in the area. According to William Shaw, a local historian and fellow of Owens College, the church was \\"intended for the 'genteel' residents who were migrating to the south side of the town\\". Byrom obtained permission from Edmund Keene, the Bishop of Chester, and was supported by many prominent local people. Its parish, which was not formalised until at least 1839, encompassed an area described by the Manchester Courier in 1900 as J. M. W. Turner sketched the tower of St John's and two nearby church spires in 1831. The sketch is in the Tate's collection.  Structure  Interior of St John's Church, Manchester, circa 1894. An illustration by Henry Edward Tidmarsh (1854‚Äì1939). Although contemporary sources such as the Manchester Mercury name Byrom as the sponsor of the building, they do not identify his architect. The church was described by the English author and historian Clare Hartwell as being the first significant building in Manchester to be constructed in the Gothic Revival style of architecture. It had galleries supported by slender cast-iron columns. The foundation stone was laid by Edward Byrom on 28 April 1768 and Keene performed the consecration on 7 July 1769, when the sermon was given by John Byrom's friend, John Clayton. Construction of the tower, which contained a peal of eight bells manufactured by Lester and Pack, was completed in May 1770. The first restoration took place in 1821, including a re-roofing paid for by a daughter of Byrom. Between 1874 and 1878 work was done at a cost of ¬£1600 and in 1898 the lighting was converted from gas to electric, substantial internal modifications were carried out and repairs made to the clock tower which cost around ¬£2200. The church bells, which were described by a local journalist for the Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advertiser as \\"among the best peal of bells in Manchester\\", were rehung in 1832 and again around 1883. The tower had clock dials on all four sides. A minute hand was added to the clock in 1833 and its mechanism was replaced around 1906. The graveyard was paved with tombstones. In 1906, the church was looking to raise funds to acquire and convert the nearby St John's Hospital of Manchester and Salford for the Ear for use as a rectory. The roof collapsed in 1924 and was rebuilt by 1926. Among people who were commemorated in the church windows were John Owens, and Sir Thomas Bazley. Another window was of some antiquity, originating from a convent in Rouen, France, and presented to the church by a grateful French refugee priest. This Entry to Jerusalem window was moved in 1929 to the Church of St Mary the Virgin, Eccles and windows depicting St John, St Peter and St Matthew, dating from 1760 by William Peckitt, were at some time moved to St Ann's Church in the city.  Functions  The church held the right to conduct the marriages of people throughout Manchester, not only from within its parish, until 1874. Despite this, there were no such services for the first 35 years of its existence, perhaps because of the continued popularity of the Collegiate Church as a venue for weddings but probably because the latter insisted on collecting its own fees for marriages held in other local churches, which effectively doubled the cost of being married at St John's rather than at the Collegiate Church. Later, after the rights of the Collegiate Church were curtailed, some weeks saw more than 100 marriage services at St John's in the years just before 1874. Burials ceased completely in 1900 but there had been very few for some years previously because the available space had been exhausted and most graves were full. In 1827, the church erected a building dedicated as a Sunday school. This was also used as a day school from 1838. In 1906, around 250 children attended the Sunday school and the church had numerous affiliated groups, such as a Penny Bank and a Choral Society. The day school accommodation was at that time condemned by the Board of Education as unfit for purpose and it was operating under a stay issued by the board. In the same year, Hannah Mitchell, a suffragette, was arrested at the day school for protesting during an election campaign speech by Winston Churchill. The building was closed in 1908 and a new school building opened on Gartside Street in 1910 at a cost of ¬£4000. This new facility was used only as Sunday school because, said the local clergy, the Board of Education put too many administrative obstacles and demands in their way, such as stipulating such a small attendance roll as to render any day school uneconomic and insisting on a dedicated playground despite there being a large open space next door that was traditionally used for that purpose. According to the foundation stone of the new school building, the church had operated the first Sunday school in Manchester, although Shaw attributes that distinction to a Mr Fildes, a Methodist whose establishment began operating from a Travis Street cellar in 1782. Shaw says that several other schools preceded that of St John's. Around 1781, the church had been the base for one of Manchester's eight fire engines.  Clergy  A condition imposed by Byrom was that he had the right to present the living. The first rector, John Clowes, held the office for 62 years until his death in 1831. He was commemorated by two stone tablets in the church, one by either Richard Westmacott or his son, erected after his death and one, the only example of the work of John Flaxman in Manchester, to celebrate his 50th anniversary as rector. Clowes preached the first Sunday school sermon in the Manchester area, introduced Swedenborgianism there and was prominent in championing Whit Walks. Clowes was succeeded by William Huntington, who had held the post of curate since 1826 and continued as rector until his death in 1874. Huntington established the Sunday school. Huntington's successor as rector was John Henn, who held office for 14 years before moving to Heaton Chapel. The next rector, G. R. Youngman, was in office from 1888 until his death in 1890. His position was taken by E. F. Leach. The last rector was Herbert Edmonds. William Cowherd, a Swedenborgian proponent of teetotalism and vegetarianism, was a curate in the late 1700s, before leaving to establish the Bible Christian Church in Salford.  Demise  By the early 1900s, the graveyard was overshadowed on its northern side by a warehouse built on the Quay Street site of the Byrom family residence. The area had been residential‚ÄîRichard Cobden was among those who lived nearby and attended the church‚Äîbut changed in character during the 19th century, as many homes once occupied by affluent families became lodging houses and the locale became increasingly a place of business. Those who did live there, or were patients in the nearby hospitals, were poor and unable to contribute significantly to the funds of the church and its schools. Fundraising bazaars were held in the 1890s and 1900s at the Free Trade Hall, in a nearby area that was more salubrious. Falling attendances due to the commercial nature of the district, and also a sense that there was some redundancy of provision given the nearby St Matthew's Church, caused the Manchester diocese to review the status of St John's and its parish in the 1920s. Following an internal review and a public consultation, in 1927 it was formally proposed that the two parishes should be merged as St Matthew's parish. The diocese preferred to retain St Matthew's and demolish St John's, at least in part because the former was a more recent construction. This was a reversal of a proposal made in 1919, when the predominantly transient Roman Catholic population of the St Matthew's parish was given as a reason to merge it into St John's. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners proposed to hand over the church site to Manchester Corporation in 1929, with the hope that the city would convert it into an open space similar to Parsonage Gardens. The Manchester Guardian had reported a similar proposal to convert the \\"bleak expanse\\" of the graveyard into an \\"open, cultivated space\\" in 1914. The church was demolished in 1931. It is commemorated by a stone cross and a plaque states that more than 22,000 bodies lie buried in the vicinity. Among those buried in the churchyard are John Owens, founder of Owens College, the forerunner of Manchester University and William Marsden, who pioneered the concept of a half-day holiday on Saturdays.

Senior medical staff are trained for the Armed Forces and conduct research in military medical services. History =Origins= The origins of the academy go back to the years of Peter the Great. In 1715 by the Tsar's order the Admiralty Hospital in the Vyborg Side of Saint Petersburg was founded. In 1717 next to in the Land Military Hospital was opened. Since 1773 surgical schools attached to both hospitals were operating. In 1786 those schools were consolidated into the Main Medical College. It became the principal training center for army and fleet physicians. = Imperial Medical and Surgical Academy = Sir James Wylie Bt Unofficially, the year 1714 is considered the foundation year of the academy. The Medical and Surgical Academy was established by the order of Emperor Paul I of 18/29 December 1798 on the initiative of Baron Alexei Vasilyev, General Director of the Medical College. At the same time a Neoclassical building for the Academy was designed by Antonio Porta. It was decorated with a set of panel paintings by Giuseppe Bernasconi. Ranked as one of the best educational institutions in the Russian Empire, it was known as the Imperial Medical and Surgical Academy from 1808. According to the order of Emperor Alexander I, a member of the Medical and Surgical Academy had the rights, liabilities, and benefits of a member of the Academy of Sciences. Nikolay Pirogov Sir James Wylie, a Scottish baronet, managed the academy between 1808 and 1838. His contributions have been commemorated with a monument which stood in front of the academy until the October Revolution. The monument was designed in 1859 by David Jensen. It was later relocated and replaced with a statue of Hygieia. In 19th century the Imperial Medical and Surgical Academy played a major role in the development of Russian natural science and medicine. In 1840 ‚Äî 1856 one of its professors was Nikolay Pirogov, considered the founder of field surgery. Since 1861 Sergey Botkin, one of Pirogov's disciples, worked at the Academy. He is considered one of the founders of modern Russian medical science and education. Botkin introduced triage, pathological anatomy, and post mortem diagnostics into Russian medical practice. = Imperial Military Medical Academy = Ivan Sechenov In 1881 the Academy's official name was changed into the Imperial Military Medical Academy. In the late 19th century, its physiology laboratory, founded by Ivan Sechenov, was at the forefront of medical research. Ivan Romanovich Tarkhanov conducted some important experiments there. In 1890 ‚Äî 1901 the Academy's President was Viktor Pashutin, one of the founders of the pathophysiologic school in Russia and of pathophysiology as an independent scientific discipline. The Nobel-prize winning physiologist Ivan Pavlov graduated from the Academy in 1879 with Gold Medal award. Since 1895 he headed Department of Physiology at the Academy for three decades. Ivan Pavlov In 1904 ‚Äî 1924 Nikolai Kravkov, the founder of Russian national school of pharmacologists, headed the Academy's Department of Pharmacology. In 1903 ‚Äî 1936 one of the Academy's professors was Sergey Fedorov, the founder of the largest national school of surgery and ¬´the father of Russian urology¬ª. The academy was also among the pioneers of medical education for women, launching the courses for nurse-midwives in 1872. Nadezhda Suslova, the first female physician in Russia, attended Sechenov's classes at the academy. A school of gymnastics (now the Military Institute of Physical Culture) was launched in 1909. =S.M. Kirov Military Medical Academy= After Sergey Kirov's assassination in 1934, the Academy received his name. Leon Orbeli, one of Pavlov's disciples, led the Academy in 1943 ‚Äî 1950. In 1956 S. M.

Martinez-Salamero, \\"Digital Loss-Free Resistor for power factor correction applications\\", Industrial Electronics Society, IECON 2013 - 39th Annual Conference of the IEEE.  Overview  Many power processing systems can be improved by the application of resistive elements. Resistors may be applied for waveshaping, damping of oscillatory waveforms, stabilization of nonstable systems, and power flow balancing. The losses involved by the application of conventional resistors may be eliminated by the synthesis of artificial, loss-free resistive elements which replace the conventional ones. The conventional resistor converts the electrical energy absorbed at its terminals into heat; however, it has been found that creation of a resistive characteristic is not necessarily followed by such energy conversion. It is possible to synthesize a Loss-Free Resistor (LFR) by the combination of a switched mode converter and a suitable control circuit. The LFR is a two-port element that has a resistive i-v curve at the input terminals. The power absorbed at the input is transferred to the source that powers the total system, so in principle no losses occur. Basic LFR realization The LFR realization is based on the control of a two-port element that has a time-variable transformer (TVT) or gyrator matrix. The realization of the controlled, time-variable transformer can be achieved by switched-mode circuits.D. Middlebrook. \\"Small-signal modeling of pulse-width modulated switched-mode power converters\\", Proceedings of the IEEE, vol 76. no 4, pp. 343-354, Apr. 1988. K. D T. Ngo, \\"Low frequency characterization of PWM converters\\", IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, vol. PE-I, pp. 223-230, Oct 1986. Realization of a controlled gyrator can be obtained by the same types of circuits operated at current mode control.Singer, S., \\"Loss free gyrator realization\\", IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems, Vol. CAS-35, No 1, pp. 26-34, Jan 1988. The input/output parameters of the TVT are given as follows: \\\\mathbf{x}^{(0)}=\\\\begin{bmatrix} v_i(t) \\\\\\\\\\\\ i_i(t) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} =\\\\begin{bmatrix} k(t) & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & k^{-1}(t)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} v_0(t) \\\\\\\\\\\\ -i_0(t) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} where k is the voltage transfer ratio of the TVT. In this case, the required resistive characteristic is created at the input terminal (a-b) of the TVT. The output of the TVT is connected to the source U, which powers the total circuit. The voltage at the input is given by v_i = k(r)U = v_{ab}(t) A conventional linear resistor R connected to the terminals (a-b) implies the following voltage/current relation: v_{ab}(t)=i_{ab}(t)R So, by controlling the voltage transfer ratio of the switching converter (which realizes the TVT) such that the above equation is obeyed, a resistive characteristic is determined at terminals (a-b). In this case, the voltage transfer ratio k(r) is given by k(t)=\\\\frac{i_{ab}(t)R}{U} where R is the resistive value of the synthesized LFR. In the case of realization by a controlled gyrator, the input/output parameters are given by \\\\mathbf{x}^{(0)}=\\\\begin{bmatrix} V_i \\\\\\\\\\\\ i_i \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} =\\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & g^{-1}(t)\\\\\\\\\\\\ g(t) & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} V_0(t) \\\\\\\\\\\\ -i_0(t) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} where g is the gyration conductance. The resistive characteristic is obtained by controlling the gyration conductance such that the following equation is obeyed: g(t)=\\\\frac{v_{ab}(t)}{UR} By applying a switched-mode converter composed of loss-free elements (in principle only), the power absorbed at terminals (a-b) is transferred to the source U, so in principle the losses are eliminated. The LFR is materialized by the combination of a controlled TVT or TVG and a signal-processing circuit (SPC), which controls the coupling network, such that equations above are obeyed. Methods of loss reduction by the transferring of energy to the source that powers the circuit are well known; however, these methods are usually applied for recovering the energy trapped in storage elements. In those circuits, there is not continuous control of the coupling networks that transfer the recovered energy to the source. In our method, the required resistive characteristic is obtained by the continuous control of the loss- free, storage-less two ports. Properties of LFR  The LFR is a two-port element that has the following characteristics: (1) an equivalent resistive characteristic R at the input terminals, and (2) a power source P at the output terminals. The value of P is determined by the power consumed by the equivalent resistor R. This power is supplied (by the power source P) to the bus U that powers the total system. The TVT (and TVG) can be realized by a family of switched-mode circuits. The losses, which practically occur in these circuits, can be modeled by a series and parallel resistors (r, and rp, respectively). Thus, the total circuit can be modeled by a cascade combination of those resistors and TVT (or TVG).

Baker: The Encyclopedia of the Pharaohs: Volume I - Predynastic to the Twentieth Dynasty 3300‚Äì1069 BC, Stacey International, , 2008, p. 175-176 As such he would have ruled from Avaris over the eastern Nile Delta and possibly over the Western Delta as well. His chronological position and identity are unclear. Attestations Khamure is one of the few attested kings of the 14th Dynasty with two scarab seals attributable to him, both of unknown provenance. One of the two scarabs is currently housed in the Petrie Museum,The scarab on Digital Egypt, Petrie Museum.The scarab on the catalog of the Petrie Museum under the catalog number 11819, while the other was sold at an auction at Lotte New York Palace Hotel in December 1991.Joyce Haynes, Yvonne Markowitz, Sue d'Auria (editor): Scarabs and Design Amulets : A Glimpse of Ancient Egypt in Miniature [Auction Catalog], NFA Classical Auctions, New York 1991, num 30, online reference. The Petrie Museum scarab is peculiar in that it has a unique and elaborate decoration on its back indicating that it was given to an official of the highest rank. The scarab is inscribed with the name of Khamure preceded by the epithet Netjer Nefer, \\"the good god\\", showing that Khamure was this king's prenomen. This means that Khamure is not listed in the surviving fragments of the Turin canon, a king list dating to the Ramesside period and recording the prenomina of the kings. Identity The archaeologists Olga Tufnell and William A. Ward argue that the name written on the scarab seal of the Petrie Museum is actually \\"'Ammu\\", possibly to be identified with 'Ammu Aahotepre, a shadowy king of the late Second Intermediate Period.Olga Tufnell: Studies on Scarab Seals Vol. 2, Aris & Phillips 1984, , see seal num. 3361William A. Ward: Some Personal Names of the Hyksos Period Rulers and Notes on the Epigraphy of Their Scarabs, Ugarit- Forschungen 8 (1976), p.353-369, see p. 368, num 42. The Egyptologists Kim Ryholt and Darrell Baker reject this reading, since Gardiner's sign N5 for the sun-disk is clearly readable on the seal together with the signs for Netjer Nefer. Hence, they argue, Khamure is the correct reading of the scarab, in agreement with Percy Newberry and Flinders Petrie.Percy E. Newberry: Scarabs an introduction to the study of Egyptian seals and signet rings, with forty- four plates and one hundred and sixteen illustrations in the text, 1906, available online copyright-free see plate XXI, num 30, p. 150. Although the chronological position of Khamure remains uncertain, Ryholt has proposed that he ruled in the 14th Dynasty, some time before Yaqub-Har and Yakareb. This estimation is based on a seriation of the scarabs dating to the Second Intermediate Period.

It is, in the words of Louis Crompton, 'perhaps the most important' of the various medieval Andalucian poetry anthologies.Louis Crompton, 'Male Love and Islamic Law in Arab Spain', in Islamic Homosexualities: Culture, History, and Literature, ed. by Stephen O. Murray and Will Roscoe (New York: New York University Press, 1997), pp. 142-58 (at p. 154). 'His aim in compiling the collection seems to have been to show that poetry produced in the West was as good as anything the East had to offer (and that stuff by Ibn Sa'id and his family was especially good)'.

Arberry (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1953), p. ix. History of the compilation = Origins = Ibn Said compiled RƒÅyƒÅt al-mubarrizƒ´n wa-ghƒÅyƒÅt al-mumayyazƒ´n in Cairo, completing it on 21 June 1243 (641 by Islamic dating). Its patron and dedicatee was MusƒÅ ibn Yaghm≈´r (1203-65).RƒÅyƒÅt al-mubarrizƒ´n wa-ghƒÅyƒÅt al-mumayyazƒ´n/The Banners of the Champions: An Anthology of Medieval Arabic Poetry from Andalusia and Beyond, selected and translated by James A. Bellamy and Patricia Owen Steiner (Madison: Hispanic Seminary of Medieval Studies, 1989), p. xxi. The RƒÅyƒÅt al-mubarrizƒ´n wa-ghƒÅyƒÅt al-mumayyazƒ´n was made as an epitome of the fifteen-volume al-Mughrib fƒ´ ·∏•ulƒÅ l-Maghrib ('The Extraordinary Book on the Adornments of the West'), whose compilation Ibn Said completed. However, Ibn Said's prologue to the RƒÅyƒÅt al-mubarrizƒ´n wa-ghƒÅyƒÅt al-mumayyazƒ´n explains that he made it before al-Mughrib fƒ´ ·∏•ulƒÅ l-Maghrib was complete, and accordingly he took care to indicate the ultimate sources of his texts. The apparent limited circulation of the anthology and its stated purpose of honouring Ibn Said's protector, M≈´sa b. Yaghm≈´r, suggests that the intended audience of the anthology was a small, private circle rather than a broad public.El libro de las banderas de los campeones, de Ibn Sa øid al- Magribƒ´, ed. by Emilio Garc√≠a G√≥mez (Madrid: Instituto de Valencia de Don Juan, 1942), pp. xlii-xliii. = Organisation = Ibn Said wrote that he wished to include only those few fragments \\"whose idea is more subtle than the West Wind, and whose language is more beautiful than a pretty face.\\" The poems chosen are all in the classical style, following 'all the traditional conventions of rhyme, meter, and lexicon' and excluding colloquial verse.RƒÅyƒÅt al-mubarrizƒ´n wa-ghƒÅyƒÅt al-mumayyazƒ´n/The Banners of the Champions: An Anthology of Medieval Arabic Poetry from Andalusia and Beyond, selected and translated by James A.

The anthology is arranged according to home and occupation of the writer. proceeding through western, central, and eastern Spain, to Ibiza, North Africa, and then Sicily. It thus covers the whole of the Andalusian world, including Alcal√°, C√≥rdoba, Granada, Lisbon, Murcia, Zaragoza, Seville, Toledo, and Valencia. Within each region, the poems are ordered by city, and then by the poet's occupation, from the highest social rank to the lowest.RƒÅyƒÅt al-mubarrizƒ´n wa-ghƒÅyƒÅt al- mumayyazƒ´n/The Banners of the Champions: An Anthology of Medieval Arabic Poetry from Andalusia and Beyond, selected and translated by James A. Bellamy and Patricia Owen Steiner (Madison: Hispanic Seminary of Medieval Studies, 1989), p. xxii. Authors include bureaucrats, gentlemen, kings, ministers, and scholars; the book is evidence of how important love poetry was to the educated of al-Andalus. In all, the anthology contains 314 poetic fragments by 145 identifiable poets; Ibn Said also included a prologue and a short epilogue, along with occasional comments on the texts and brief notes on the poets. According to A. J. Arberry. :: the author has exercised, and everywhere demonstrates, his personal judgement, first as to the poets selected for quotation, and secondly as to the passages chosen. He was not able to deny himself the immodest pleasure of quoting from his own writings, for more extensively than from those of any other poet; and the entire section devoted to Alcal√° la Real is taken up with the products of members of his family ... It seems doubtful whether more than a small handful of poems have been cited in their entirety; most of the quotations are quite brief extracts---in some instances a single stanza---from what were originally lengthy compositions.Moorish Poetry: A Translation of 'The Pennants', an Anthology Compiled in 1243 by the Andalusian Ibn Sa'id, trans. by A.

Content The book compares East and West across the last 15,000 years, arguing that physical geography rather than culture, religion, politics, genetics, or great men explains Western domination of the globe. Morris' Social Development Index considers the amount of energy a civilization can usefully capture, its ability to organize (measured by the size of its largest cities), war-making capability (weapons, troop strength, logistics), and information technology (speed and reach of writing, printing, telecommunication, etc.). The evidence and statistical methods used in this book are explained in more detail in Social Development, a free eBook, and by the published volume, The Measure of Civilization. Morris argues that: * When agriculture was first invented, areas with reliable rainfall benefited most. * Irrigation benefited drier areas such as Egypt and the Fertile Crescent. * Plants and animals more easily domesticated gave certain areas an early advantage, especially the Fertile Crescent and China. (See cradle of civilization.) Development of Africa and the Americas started on the same path, but it was delayed by thousands of years. * With the development of ships in Eurasia, rivers became trade routes. Europe and empires in Greece and Rome benefited from the Mediterranean, compared to Chinese empires (who later built the Grand Canal for similar purposes). * Raids from the Eurasian Steppe brought diseases that caused epidemics in settled populations. * The Social Development Index shows the West leading until the 6th century, China leading until the 18th century, and the West leading again in the modern era. * After the development of ocean-going ships, the significantly greater size of the Pacific Ocean made trans-Atlantic exploration and trade more feasible and profitable for Europe than trans-Pacific exploration and trade for East Asia. Though the mariner's compass was invented in China in the 11th century, Chinese exploration was less successful than the European Age of Discovery and subsequent colonization. * Eurasian diseases to which people in the Americas had no immunity were a byproduct of Eurasian development that devastated Native Americans after contact, in addition to superior European weapons. * Globalization and advances in information technology are leveling differences between civilizational areas. Reception The book won several literary awards, including the 2011 PEN Center USA Literary Award for Creative Nonfiction and 2011 GetAbstract International Book Award, and was named as one of the books of the year by Newsweek, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Policy, The New York Times, and a number of other newspapers. It has been translated into 13 languages. The Economist has called it \\"an important book‚Äîone that challenges, stimulates and entertains. Anyone who does not believe there are lessons to be learned from history should start here.\\" The book has been criticized by the Canadian historical sociologist Ricardo Duchesne for offering a diffuse definition of the West which Morris envisions encompassing not only Europe but all civilizations descending from the Fertile Crescent, including Islam, as well as a propensity to level out fundamental differences between the development of the West and the rest, which disregards the singular role of Europe in shaping the modern world. Morris replied, saying that \\"despite his review‚Äôs length, rather little of it takes on my book‚Äôs central thesis\\", and defending his focus on China. The notion that the Middle East and Europe are in the same system was introduced by David Wilkinson in 1987.

Kr√∏yer. The large work, which took several years to complete, shows many of the artists in the group known as the Skagen Painters as well as influential members of Skagen's local community. Background The Skagen Painters were a close-knit group of mainly Danish artists who gathered each summer from the late 1870s in the fishing village of Skagen in the far north of Jutland, painting the local fishermen and their own gatherings and celebrations. Peder Severin Kr√∏yer (1851‚Äì1909), who was born in Stavanger, Norway, but brought up in Copenhagen, first arrived in Skagen in 1882 and returned almost every summer, finally settling there after marrying Marie Triepcke in 1889. He had already gained a reputation for his paintings of the fishermen in Hornb√¶k on the north coast of Zealand and had been influenced by the Impressionist movement in his travels to France. In Skagen, he became one of the central and most enthusiastic members of the group of painters, creating masterpieces emphasizing the special effects of the local light in his beach scenes while painting several memorable works recording the lively gatherings of the artists. Painting description The painting depicts many of the members of the artists' colony as well as local inhabitants gathered around the traditional midsummer bonfire, celebrated in Denmark on Sankt Hans aften. The artists and the influential personalities from the village are on the left while the rest of the inhabitants are on the right. Kr√∏yer originally made a sketch of the event in 1892 but it took him 14 years to complete the large painting which measures x . In her Northern Lights, Lise Svanholm tells us Kr√∏yer took his easel onto the beach at Skagen √òsterby in 1903 and spent a couple of hours making an extensive sketch. In the foreground, Kr√∏yer's daughter Vibeke stands in front of Marie Kr√∏yer's brother, Valdemar Triepcke, next to Walter Schwartz, the mayor's son. Otto and Alba Schwartz come next, then Michael Ancher in his straw hat beside Degn Br√∏ndum, the innkeeper. In the next row is Br√∏ndum's daughter, Anna Ancher in a green shawl, Henry Brodersen, then the treasurer's wife and, at the end of the row, Schr√∏der, the postmaster with his little wife Soffi. In addition to the painters, the work includes the writer Holger Drachmann, the head of the lifeboat service, Captain P.K. Nielsen, and the town's treasurer, Brodersen, with his sister in law, Mrs Dethlef J√ºrgensen, on his arm. On the right-hand side, the artist Laurits Tuxen can be seen with Frederikke who is looking up wondrously at her husband. Tuxen is sketching the scene, resulting in a work which can be seen in Skagens Museum (Kr√∏yer Painting the Midsummer Bonfire, 1906). The red and orange flames are blowing over towards Hugo Alfv√©n, with Marie on his arm, leaning on a fishing boat. Assessment The painting is one of the most important in the collection at Skagens Museum, although Kr√∏yer himself felt the work was too dark, especially the sky which should have been brighter. He recognized it was not one of his best works but believed it would have considerable historic importance. On signing the painting, however, his daughter Vibeke remembers a celebration which reached such heights that Drachmann threw his glass down on the floor. Apparently Kr√∏yer replied: \\"I find, Drachmann, you should think twice before flinging other people's glasses on the floor. It was not your fault it didn't break.\\" Nevertheless, the painting is now generally accepted as one of the most important works by the Skagen Painters. Writing in Kristeligt Dagblad, Morten Rasmussen reports that the work is considered by many to be Kr√∏yer's \\"Magnum Opus\\", representing a reflection of his own life and a tribute to the people who contributed to his success.

When he was a junior, Abraham had a commercial real estate internship and lived in the nearby town of Lexington. He then received an offer to play professional baseball in Germany, but the general manager of the Toronto Blue Jays at the time, J. P. Ricciardi, made him a substantial offer to join them. Ricciardi grew up with Abraham's family, while Brian's uncle, Dave Abraham, was a long time trainer with the Blue Jays.MLB.com ‚Äì Blue Jays extend trainers and coaches Career Abraham joined the Blue Jays in 2007, working for them as advance scouting and video coordinator through the 2012 season.Linkedin.com ‚Äì Brian Abraham profile Advance video staffs are still relatively new to baseball, and Ricciardi wanted the Blue Jays to get out of the Dark Ages a little. Then, when Abraham attended spring training in 2007, he did not know he would be staying on, so literally he was thrown into the fire like anyone is on their first job, and he responded positively in all of his or her endeavors.

He earned his first World Series ring when Boston won the 2013 Championship. Abraham was the Red Sox' MLB bullpen catcher during the 2013‚Äì2014 seasons. He threw batting practice and assisted the coaching staff with video and statistical reports, focusing his interest on the relief pitchers. In 2015, he began assisting Boston's director of player development, Ben Crockett.

It is not clear with whom he trained. It is not known whether he visited Italy although his work is clearly influenced by Italian art. He was mainly active in the Leuven region and that is why most of his works are still found in that area.De schoonheid van het lijden The Martyrdom of Saint Dorothea, central panel Van der Baren was an active participant in Leuven's rhetorician circles, which were responsible for the production of theatre performances. His brother held the leading position of the prince in the local chamber of rhetoric De Roos (The Rose). Josse van der Baren was a friend of Justus Lipsius (1547-1606), the eminent philologist and humanist who resided and taught in Leuven. Lipsius composed the epitath on the tombstone of the five-year-old son of van Baren who died in 1605.Bart A. M. Ramakers, Conformisten en rebellen: Rederijkerscultuur in de Nederlanden (1400-1650), Amsterdam University Press, 2003, p. 247-249 Work =Painting= The St Ivo Triptych, central panel Josse van der Baren mainly painted religious altarpieces on panel. His work is preserved in and near Leuven, including in Leuven's St Peter's Church, the Park Abbey in Heverlee and the St Laurentius Church in Veltem. At the time, many Flemish artists such as Michiel Coxie and Frans Floris painted in an Italianizing style and van der Baren's work was clearly influenced by this movement. His masterpiece is the Martyrdom of St. Sebastian (M - Museum Leuven). It was originally a triptych of which now only the central panel has been preserved.Martyrdom of St. Sebastian at Museum M Other works by his hand are the Martyrdom of Saint Dorothea and the St Ivo Triptych both painted for Leuven's St. Peter's Church.St Ivo Triptych Martyrdom of Saint Dorothea The Martyrdom of Saint Dorothea was commissioned by the local chamber of rhetoric De Roos for its chapel in the St. Peter's Church in Leuven.Jan Papy, Inleiding, in: Justus Lipsius, Jan Papy, Iusti Lipsi Lovanium, Leuven University Press, 2000, Leuven Saint Dorothea was the patron saint of the chamber of rhetoric De Roos since roses play an important role in the saint's legend. The frontal view of the triptych depicts the martyrdom of Saint Dorothea in a style which is reminiscent of Michiel Coxie. The paintings on the reverse side of the triptych reveal the originality of van der Baren. The reverse side shows architectural frames with views of Leuven and cartouches with rose garlands. Two poems are painted in trompe-l'≈ìil on illusionistic paper sheets. The St Ivo Triptych was commissioned by the law faculty of the Old University of Leuven. The central panel depicts Ivo of Kermartin as the advocate of the poor who gives alms. A badly damaged Mater Dolorosa painted in grisaille on the reverse side of a panel of the Virgin attributed to the Master of Fl√©malle (St√§del Museum, Frankfurt am Main) has been attributed to van der Baren. The painting represents the grieving Mary with a sword through her heart.Stephan Kemperdick, Der Meister von Fl√©malle: die Werkstatt Robert Campins und Rogier van der Weyden, Brepols, 1997, p. 22The Mater Dolorosa at the artothek =Drawing= Panorama of Heverlee Van der Baren's landscape drawings were the basis for several engravings. His panoramas of Leuven and Heverlee were engraved and printed in Justus Lipsius‚Äô 1605 Lovanium, a history of the Duchy of Brabant.View of Leuven The original panoramic drawing of Heverlee may have been made at the request of the aristocrat Charles III de Cro√ø who had an extensive manuscript collection and had significant land holdings in Heverlee. Justus Lipsius wished to convince Charles III de Cro√ø to move his library to Heverlee and establish a humanist academy. Lipsius asked van der Baren to indicate the location of this planned academy in his panorama. The plate of the panorama of Leuven was engraved by Pieter van der Borcht (I) and further processed by Theodoor Galle.

The area, part of which is now preserved by the state as the Brennick Lochmere Archaeological Site, is a multi-component site with evidence of human occupation from the Middle Archaic through the Late Woodland periods. The site was occupied in historic times by the Winnipesaukee sub-tribe of the Pennacook people, and is near Aquadoctan (aka The Weirs), one of the largest native towns of prehistoric New Hampshire. The district also encompasses a number of archaeologically sensitive historic sites that were developed by white settlers and later residents to take advantage of the river's water power for industrial purposes. These uses began as early as the 1770s and continued into the 19th century, when the proprietors of the area's mills contested with the wealthier owners of downstream mills in Manchester, New Hampshire, Lowell, Massachusetts, and other sites on the Merrimack River for control over the river's flow. These well-funded interests eventually purchased all of the major water rights in the area, and shut the smaller area mills down, and by 1882 most of them lay in ruins.National Register nomination for Lochmere Archeological District; available by request from the National Park Service About of the area was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, an area that includes 13 prehistoric and 18 historic sites. Some of the archaeologically sensitive areas have been partially compromised by home construction in the area, and by the state in the dredging and widening the river channel.
