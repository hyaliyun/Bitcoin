The poem is in the form of a dream vision in rhyme royal stanza and contains one of the earliest references to the idea that St. Valentine's Day is a special day for lovers.Oruch, Jack B., \\"St. Valentine, Chaucer, and Spring in February,\\" Speculum, 56 (1981): 534‚Äì65. Oruch's survey of the literature finds no association between Valentine and romance prior to Chaucer. He concludes that Chaucer is likely to be \\"the original mythmaker in this instance.\\" Colfa.utsa.edu Summary The poem begins with the narrator reading Cicero‚Äôs Somnium Scipionis in the hope of learning some \\"certeyn thing\\". When he falls asleep, Scipio Africanus the Elder appears and guides him up through the celestial spheres to a gate promising both a \\"welle of grace\\" and a stream that \\"ledeth to the sorweful were/ Ther as a fissh in prison is al drye\\" (reminiscent of the famous grimly inscribed gates in Dante's Inferno). After some deliberation at the gate, the narrator enters and passes through Venus‚Äôs dark temple with its friezes of doomed lovers and out into the bright sunlight. Here Nature is convening a parliament at which the birds will all choose their mates. The three tercel (male) eagles make their case for the hand of a formel (female) eagle until the birds of the lower estates begin to protest and launch into a comic parliamentary debate, which Nature herself finally ends. None of the tercels wins the formel, for at her request Nature allows her to put off her decision for another year (indeed, female birds of prey often become sexually mature at one year of age, males only at two years). Nature, as the ruling figure, in allowing the formel the right to choose not to choose, is acknowledging the importance of free will, which is ultimately the foundation of a key theme in the poem, that of common profit. Nature allows the other birds, however, to pair off. The dream ends with a song welcoming the new spring. The dreamer awakes, still unsatisfied, and returns to his books, hoping still to learn the thing for which he seeks. Manuscripts right There are fifteen manuscript sources for the poem: * British Library, Harley 7333 * Cambridge University Library Gg. IV.27 * Cambridge University Library Ff. I.6 (Findern) * Cambridge University Library Hh.IV.12 (incomplete) * Pepys 2006, Magdalene College, Cambridge * Trinity College, Cambridge R.3.19 * Bodleian Library, Arch.

The stemma and genealogy of these authorities was studied by John Koch in 1881, and later established by Eleanor Prescott Hammond in 1902, dividing them into two main groups, A and B (last five MSS), although the stemma is by no means definitive. Concerning the author of the poem, there is no doubt that it was written by Geoffrey Chaucer, for so he tells us twice in his works. * The first time is in the Introduction (Prologue) to The Legend of Good Women: \\"He made the book that hight the Hous of Fame, / And eke the Deeth of Blaunche the Duchesse, / And the Parlement of Foules, as I gesse\\". * The second allusion is found in the Retraction to The Canterbury Tales: \\"the book of the Duchesse; the book of Seint Valentynes day of the Parlement of Briddes\\". A more difficult question is that of date. Early criticism of the poem, as far as the first decades of the 20th century, relied mainly on the different interpretations of the text‚Äîcomparing the fight for the female eagle with royal betrothals of the age‚Äîto produce a date of composition for the poem. Fred N. Robinson (Complete Works of Geoffrey Chaucer, 1957: 791) mentioned that \\"if the theories of allegory in the Parliament are rejected, the principal evidence usually relied on for dating the poem about 1381-2 disappears\\". Later criticism, however, is much more objective on the reasons why the poem has been dated in 1382, the main reason given in lines 117‚Äì118 of the poem itself: \\"As wisly as I sawe the [Venus], northe northe west / When I begane my sweuene for to write\\" for according to John M. Manly (1913: 279‚Äì90) Venus is never strictly in the position \\"north-north-west...but it can be easily thought to be so when it reaches its extreme northern point\\". Manly adds that this condition was met in May 1374, 1382, and 1390. The third date is easily discarded since we know that the poem is already mentioned as composed in the Prologue to The Legend of Good Women. Derek Brewer (1960: 104) then argues that the date of 1382, as opposed to that of 1374, is much more likely for the composition of the poem since, during the same period (1373‚Äì85), Chaucer wrote many other works including The House of Fame which, in all respects, seems to have been composed earlier than The Parliament of Fowls, thus: \\"a very reasonable, if not certain, date for the Parlement is that it was begun in May 1382, and was ready for St. Valentine's Day, 14th February 1383\\" (Brewer, 1960: 104). Although much of the criticism on the interpretation of The Parliament of Foules‚Äî which would render clues for its date of composition‚Äîis contradictory, and criticism about the importance of line 117 does not agree on whether it can be taken as serious evidence for the dating of the poem, there is nowadays a general agreement among scholars as to 1381‚Äì1382 being the date of composition for The Parliament of Foules. This places the poem in the same year as fifteen-year-old King Richard II married fifteen-year-old Anne of Bohemia.

It is also known as Hottentot-fig (though this nickname is considered a racist term), ice plant, highway ice plant, or pigface, and in South Africa as the sour fig (). It was previously classified in Mesembryanthemum and is sometimes referred to by this name: Mesembryanthemum edule.  Description  Carpobrotus edulis is a creeping, mat-forming succulent species and member of the fig-marigold family, Aizoaceae, one of about 30 species in the genus Carpobrotus. C. edulis is easily confused with its close relatives, including the more diminutive and less aggressive Carpobrotus chilensis (sea fig), with which it hybridizes readily. C. edulis can, however, be distinguished from most of its relatives by the size and colour of its flowers. The large, diameter flowers of C. edulis are yellow or light pink, whereas the smaller, diameter C. chilensis flowers are deep magenta. On the flowers, two of the calyx lobes are longer, extending further than the petals. The leaves of C. edulis are only very slightly curved and have serrated sides near the tips.  In South Africa  = Distribution = The sour fig grows on coastal and inland slopes from Namaqualand in the Northern Cape through the Western Cape to the Eastern Cape. It is often seen as a pioneer in disturbed sites. = Ecology = Flowers are pollinated by solitary bees, honey bees, carpenter bees, and many beetle species. Leaves are eaten by tortoises. Flowers are eaten by antelopes and baboons. Fruits are eaten by baboons, rodents, porcupines, antelopes, who also disperse the seeds. The clumps provide shelter for snails, lizards, and skinks. Puff adders and other snakes, such as the Cape cobra, are often found in Carpobrotus clumps, where they ambush the small rodents attracted by the fruits. = Growth = Fruits Ice plants grow year round, with individual shoot segments growing more than 3 ft (1 m) per year. Ice plants can grow to at least 165 ft (50 m) in diameter. Flowers are produced mainly during late winter-spring (August‚ÄìOctober). They open in the morning in bright sunlight, and close at night.  Invasive species  Carpobrotus edulis has naturalised in many other regions throughout the world, and is an invasive species in several parts, notably Australia, California and the Mediterranean, all of which have similar climates. The ice plant has escaped from cultivation and has become invasive, posing a serious ecological problem by forming vast monospecific zones, lowering biodiversity, and competing directly with several threatened or endangered plant species for nutrients, water, light, and space.(State Resources Agency 1990). Found at Cap Angela in Bizerte, Tunisia near the Mediterranean Sea = Mediterranean = On the Mediterranean coast, Carpobrotus has spread out rapidly and now parts of the coastline are completely covered by this invasive species. Moreover, another invasive species, the black rat, has been shown to enhance the spreading of the ice plant through its feces. As the ice plant represents a food resource for the rat, both benefit from each other (invasive mutualism). = New Zealand = In New Zealand C. edulis and its hybrids are classed as unwanted organisms and are listed on the National Pest Plant Accord. = US = Purple and yellow flowering ice plants in Northern California. The ice plant forms large monospecific zones. Although the ice plant may have arrived by ship as early as the 16th century,Au, Leakhana. Carpobrotus edulis in California Coastal Plant Communities , Restoration and Reclamation Review, University of Minnesota, Vol. 6, No. 1, Fall 2000. C. edulis was actively introduced in the early 1900s to stabilize dunes and soil along railroad tracks; it was later put to use by Caltrans for ground cover along freeway embankments. Thousands of acres were planted in California until the 1970s. It easily spreads by seed (hundreds per fruit) and from segmentation (any shoot segment can produce roots). Its succulent foliage, bright magenta or yellow flowers, and resistance to some harsh coastal climatic conditions (salt) have also made it a favored garden plant. The ice plant was, for several decades, widely promoted as an ornamental plant, and it is still available at some nurseries. Ice plant foliage can turn a vibrant red to yellow in color. Despite its use as a soil stabilizer, it actually exacerbates and speeds up coastal erosion. It holds great masses of water in its leaves, and its roots are very shallow. In the rainy season, the added weight on unstable sandstone slopes and dunes increases the chances of slope collapse and landslides. The ice plant is still abundant along highways, beaches, on military bases, and in other public and private landscapes. It spreads beyond landscape plantings and has invaded foredune, dune scrub, coastal bluff scrub, coastal prairie, and, most recently, maritime chaparral communities. In California, the ice plant is found in coastal habitats from north of Eureka, south at least as far as Rosarito in Baja California. It is intolerant of frost, and is not found far inland or at elevations greater than about 500 ft (150 m). Flowering occurs almost year-round, beginning in February in southern California and continuing until the autumn in northern California, with flowers present for at least a few months in any given population. = Removal of plants = Control of ice plants can be attempted by pulling out individual plants by hand, or with the use of earth-moving machinery such as a skid-steer or tractor, though it is necessary to remove buried stems, and mulch the soil to prevent re- establishment. For chemical control, glyphosate herbicides are used. Because of the high water content of shoot tissues, burning of live or dead plants is not a useful method of control or disposal.  Cultivation  It needs well- drained soil, a sunny position, and room to spread. It is an excellent evergreen, drought- and wind-resistant groundcover; it can be planted on flat, sandy ground, on loose sand dunes, lime-rich and brackish soils, and gravelly gardens, as well as in containers, rockeries, and embankments, and will cascade over terrace walls.  Uses  Its leaves are edible, as are its fruit, as with some other members of the family Aizoaceae. In South Africa the sour fig's ripe fruit are gathered and either eaten fresh or made into a very tart jam. Carpobrotus edulis, also known as igcukuma in the Xhosa language, is a medicinal plant used by the traditional healers in cases of common infections in HIV/AIDS patients.

It is an insecticide, and has been shown to enhance the effectiveness of other insecticides in combination. Myristicin is also a precursor for amphetamine derivative compounds structurally related to MDMA; it is believed to be metabolized into MMDA in the body to produce hallucinogenic effects, and can be converted to MMDMA in controlled chemical synthesis. It interacts with many enzymes and signaling pathways in the body, is cytotoxic to living cells, and may also have chemoprotective properties.  Uses  Isolated myristicin has proven an effective insecticide against many agricultural pests, including Aedes aegypti mosquito larvae, Spilosoma obliqua (hairy caterpillars), Epilachna varivestis (Mexican bean beetles), Acyrthosiphon pisum (pea aphids), mites, and Drosophila melanogaster (fruit flies). Myristicin was shown to be an effective repellant, and to cause mortality via direct and systemic exposure. It also displayed a synergistic effect when administered to insects in combination with existing insecticides. The structure of myristicin closely resembles that of amphetamine compounds, and it is capable of producing psychotropic effects similar to MDMA compounds. Because of this, it can be used in synthetic synthesis to create amphetamine derivatives, and create designer drugs like MMDMA that are similar in structure and effect to MDMA. Out of the common spices that contain myristicin, nutmeg has the highest relative concentration of the compound. Therefore, it is used most frequently to isolate myristicin or exploit its effects. 280x280pxWhile there are accidental nutmeg poisonings, it is also known to be abused with the intention of achieving a low cost high resembling psychedelics, particularly by adolescents, drug users, college students, and prisoners. Relatively large doses of nutmeg are required to produce effects, therefore a majority of reported nutmeg intoxication cases appear to be the result of intentional abuse. Furthermore, myristicin interferes with multiple signaling pathways and enzyme processes in the body. It is toxic to cells and also may have chemoprotective properties, making it an interesting topic for further pharmacological or therapeutic research. [See Pharmacology, Toxicity]  Sources  Myristicin can be found in nutmeg, black pepper, and many members of the Umbelliferae family including anise, carrots, parsley, celery, dill, and parsnip. Trace amounts have also been isolated from a variety of plant species including Ridolfia segetum (harvest fennel), species of the Oenanthe genus (water dropworts), species of the Lamiaceae family (mint, sage, or deadnettle families), Cinnamomum glanduliferum (Nepal camphor tree), and Piper mullesua (\\"Hill Pepper\\"). Depending on the conditions of growth and storage of the plant, a high quality nutmeg (Myristica fragrans) seed can contain up to 13 mg of myristicin per 1 gram, or 1.3%. In the isolated essential oils, myristicin constitutes on average 13.24% of nutmeg oil, 6.32% of parsley leaf oil, 7.63% of dill herb oil, and 0.18% of celery seed oil.  Physiological Effects  = Psychoactive Effects = The psychotropic potential of myristicin is believed to emerge when it is metabolized into MMDA, an amphetamine derivative that is reported to have a more potent hallucinogenic effect than mescaline. There is more research needed on the exact mechanism of action of myristicin in the body. Documented symptoms include anxiety, fear, a sense of impending doom, detachment from reality, acute psychotic episodes, visual hallucinations (time, color, or space distortions) and hostile, combative, agitated behavior. There have been cases of prolonged use leading to chronic psychosis. 455x455pxWith a chemical structure resembling amphetamines and other precursors, myristicin can also be used to synthesize illicit hallucinogenic drugs. Under controlled conditions, myristicin isolated from nutmeg oil can be converted into MMDMA, a synthetic \\"designer drug\\" amphetamine derivative that is less potent than MDMA but produces comparable stimulant and hallucinogenic effects. A 400 mg dose of myristicin has been shown to produce ‚Äúmild cerebral stimulation‚Äù in 4 out of 10 human subjects. Myristicin is most commonly consumed in nutmeg, and 400 mg would be contained in approximately 15 g of nutmeg powder. However, at a minimum dose of about 5 g of nutmeg powder, symptoms of nutmeg intoxication can begin to emerge, indicating the interaction of other compounds contained in nutmeg. Elemicin and Safrole are also components of nutmeg that, while at lower concentrations than myristicin, are thought to contribute to the hallucinogenic and physiological symptoms of nutmeg intoxication. = Toxicity = Myristicin has been proven to be cytotoxic, or toxic to living cells. Specifically, it stimulates cytochrome c release, which activates caspase cascades and induces early apoptosis in the cells. In human neuroblastoma SK- N-SH cells, myristicin led to apoptosis and observable morphological changes, as well as chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation. This indicates a definite cytotoxic effect, and a potential neurotoxic effect that requires further investigation. Myristicin has also been shown to inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes in humans, which is responsible for metabolizing a variety of substrates including hormones and toxins, allowing these substrates to accumulate. This can compound its own toxicity and/or lead to increased bioavailability of other substances, which can lower the threshold for overdose from other drugs that may be in the body. The effects of nutmeg consumed in large doses are attributed mostly to myristicin, where 1‚Äì7 hours following ingestion symptoms include disorientation, giddiness, stupor, and/or stimulation of the central nervous system leading to euphoria, intense hallucinations that alter one's orientation to time and surroundings, feelings of levitation, loss of consciousness, tachycardia, weak pulse, anxiety, and hypertension. Symptoms of nutmeg intoxication further include nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, dryness of mouth, mydriasis or miosis, hypotension, shock, and potentially death. Myristicin poisoning can be detected by testing levels of myristicin in the blood. There are currently no known antidotes for myristicin poisoning, and treatment focuses on symptom management and potential sedation in cases of extreme delirium or aggravation.  Pharmacology  Myristicin is soluble in ethanol and acetone, but insoluble in water Myristicin is additionally known to be a weak inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO), a liver enzyme in humans that metabolizes neurotransmitters (e.g., serotonin, dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine). It lacks the basic nitrogen atom that is typical of MAO inhibitors (MAOIs), potentially explaining a weaker inhibitory effect. While smaller concentrations of MAOIs may not cause problems, there are additional warnings regarding drug interactions. Those taking antidepressants that are MAOIs (e.g. Phenelzine, Isocarboxazid, Tranylcypromine, Selegiline) or taking selective serotonin re- uptake inhibiting (SSRI) antidepressants should avoid essential oils rich in myristicin, such as that of nutmeg or anise. Myristicin has also been shown to have anti-cholinergic activity, therefore symptoms of myristicin poisoning overlap largely with those of anticholinergic toxicity. It is thought that myristicin frequently leads to miosis while mydriasis is more typical of anticholinergic toxicity, but there is more research needed on this distinction. Myristicin also has potential chemoprotective properties. In mouse liver and small intestine mucosa, myristicin induced higher levels of glutathione S-transferase (GST), which catalyzes a reaction that detoxifies activated carcinogens. This indicates that myristicin may act as an inhibitor of tumorigenesis. It is still unknown how much the tendency of myristicin to induce apoptosis in cells contributes to its chemoprotective abilities.

(fig-marigold family) is a large family of dicotyledonous flowering plants containing 135 genera and about 1800 species. They are commonly known as ice plants or carpet weeds. They are often called vygies in South Africa and New Zealand. Highly succulent species that resemble stones are sometimes called mesembs.  Description  Mesembryanthemum guerichianum seedling, showing the epidermal bladder cells that inspired the name \\"ice plant\\". Pronunciation of the South African colloquial name, Vygie, for Aizoaceae. The family Aizoaceae is widely recognised by taxonomists. It once went by the botanical name \\"Ficoidaceae\\", now disallowed. The APG II system of 2003 (unchanged from the APG system of 1998) also recognizes the family, and assigns it to the order Caryophyllales in the clade core eudicots. The APG II system also classes the former families Mesembryanthemaceae Fenzl, Sesuviaceae Horan. and Tetragoniaceae Link under the family Aizoaceae. The common Afrikaans name \\"vygie\\" meaning \\"small fig\\" refers to the fruiting capsule, which resembles the true fig. Glistening epidermal bladder cells give the family its common name \\"ice plants\\". Most species (96%, 1782 species in 132 genera) in this family are endemic to arid or semiarid parts of Southern Africa in the Succulent Karoo. Much of the Aizoaceae's diversity is found in the Greater Cape Floristic Region, which is the most plant-diverse temperate region in the world. A few species are found in Australia and the Central Pacific area. Most fig-marigolds are herbaceous, rarely somewhat woody, with sympodial growth and stems either erect or prostrate. Leaves are simple, opposite or alternate, and more or less succulent with entire (or rarely toothed) margins. Flowers are perfect in most species (but unisexual in some), actinomorphic, and appear singularly or in few-flowered cymes developing from the leaf axils. Sepals are typically five (3-8) and more or less connate (fused) below. True petals are absent. However, some species have numerous linear petals derived from staminodes. The seed capsules have one to numerous seeds per cell and are often hygrochastic, dispersing seeds by \\"jet action\\" when wet. Evolution The radiation of the Aizoaceae, specifically the subfamily Ruschioideae, was one of the most recent among the angiosperms, occurring 1.13-6.49 Mya. It is also one of the fastest radiations ever described in the angiosperms, with a diversification rate of about 4.4 species per million years. This diversification was roughly contemporaneous with major radiations in two other succulent lineages, Cactaceae and Agave. The family includes many species that use crassulacean acid metabolism as pathway for carbon fixation. Some species in the subfamily Sesuvioideae instead use carbon fixation, which might have evolved multiple times in the group. Uses Tetragonia tetragonoides (\\"New Zealand spinach\\") Several genera are cultivated. Lithops, or \\"living stones\\", are popular as novelty house plants because of their stone-like appearance. Some species are edible, including: * Carpobrotus edulis (Hottentot fig, highway ice plant) has edible leaves and fruit. * Mesembryanthemum crystallinum has edible leaves. * Tetragonia tetragonoides (\\"New Zealand spinach\\") is grown as a garden plant in somewhat dry climates and used as an alternative to spinach in upscale salads.

It is bordered by the Brooklyn Navy Yard and the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway to the north, Williamsburg to the northeast, Classon Avenue and Bedford‚ÄìStuyvesant to the east, Atlantic Avenue and Prospect Heights to the south and southwest and Vanderbilt Avenue and Fort Greene to the west., p.xxxi \\"The Hill\\", as the general area was known - with a maximum elevation of , the highest in the area - was believed to have health benefits because many people believed that disease was more prevalent in low-lying areas. The area is named after Clinton Avenue, which in turn was named in honor of New York Governor DeWitt Clinton (1769‚Äì1828). The main thoroughfare is DeKalb Avenue. The affluentRawson, Elizabeth Reich. \\"Clinton Hill\\" in , p.272 neighborhood's mixture of apartment buildings, mansions, brownstone and brick rowhouses, and the Pratt Institute and St. Joseph's College, built at various times in a number of different styles, is a great part of its charm. Clinton Hill is part of Brooklyn Community District 2, and its primary ZIP Codes are 11238 and 11205. It is patrolled by the 88th Precinct of the New York City Police Department. History Charles Millard Pratt House, 241 Clinton Avenue The area‚Äôs European history began in the 1640s, when Dutch colonists laid tobacco plantations near Wallabout Bay. Bedford Corners, situated just southeast of Clinton Hill, was incorporated in 1663, and the settlers (both Dutch and French Huguenot) purchased surrounding lands from the native Lenape in 1670. On August 27, 1776, the \\"Road to Jamaica\\" (approximately Atlantic Avenue, the southern edge of today‚Äôs neighborhood) was used by the British army in a surprise overnight march to outflank the American army, which was forced to retreat toward Gowanus Creek, and two nights later, to Manhattan. After the war, the Dutch continued to build on the land, which sloped toward the East River and offered great views of the water and of Manhattan. The tree-lined Clinton Avenue was laid out as a boulevard along the crest of the hill in 1832, and by the 1840s, Clinton Hill and neighboring Fort Greene had become fashionable neighborhoods for the wealthy of Brooklyn, who could commute to Manhattan by way of stagecoach to the Fulton Ferry. The area was originally devised as a rural get-away for those \\"determined to escape from the closeness of city life\\", as Walt Whitman, editor of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, put it in 1846. George Washington Pine had bought up the land in the area and broke it into lots, selling them to those who wanted to lead a quiet life not too far from the conveniences of the Navy Yard. Whitman, a 28-year resident of Brooklyn, had lived for less than a year in the area in 1855, where he completed his masterpiece Leaves of Grass. The 1995 New Yorker article \\"Walt Whitman‚Äôs Ghost‚ÄùBerman, Paul. \\"Walt Whitman's Ghost\\" The New Yorker (June 12, 1995) identified the address as 99 Ryerson Street, which still stands. In the 1860s, after the Civil War, Clinton Hill was developed with row houses, which dominated the street scene by the 1880s. These attracted affluent professionals. The area's development continued after Charles Pratt, an oil executive, built a mansion at 232 Clinton Avenue, which is now part of the Brooklyn campus of St. Joseph's College's. Pratt also built houses there for his sons, which he gave to them as wedding gifts; other mansions followed, part of the general migration of merchants from New York City (Manhattan) to Brooklyn,, p.972 and the area became known as Brooklyn's \\"Gold Coast\\". Pratt founded the Pratt Institute in 1887, and its campus remains a focus of the neighborhood. After the late 1870s, Clinton Hill was one of the stops on the Brooklyn, Flatbush and Coney Island Railway (BF&CI;, now part of the Brighton subway line), an excursion line which would bring families from the neighborhood to Brighton Beach for a day of recreation, and allow them to be home \\"at a reasonable hour\\". Entire families would use the BF&CI; to relocate to the newly built Brighton Beach Hotel - owned by the same men who built the railroad - for the summer months, while the paterfamilias commuted to New York via ferry to work., p.1135 By 1900, apartment buildings were being built on Clinton Avenue, which replaced the mansions there and on Washington Avenue by the 1920s and 40s. In addition some of the remaining mansions were converted into rooming houses in the following decades, and urban renewal, part of Robert Moses' relentless rebuilding of the city, cleared five blocks south of the Pratt Institute, destroying the brownstones there. This was followed in the 1970s by the brownstone revival, in which many of the remaining brownstones were restored. In the 2000s, the neighborhood became somewhat gentrified, with generally wealthier people moving into the area. New construction included an apartment building of passive house design at 283 Greene Street. Demographics Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Clinton Hill was 34,791, an increase of 1,499 (4.5%) from the 33,292 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .Table PL-P5 NTA: Total Population and Persons Per Acre - New York City Neighborhood Tabulation Areas*, 2010, Population Division - New York City Department of City Planning, February 2012.

In the 21st century, the neighborhood has experienced a significant increase in population, with increased gentrification and a growing upper-middle-class population. Landmarks The Clinton Hill Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. The district includes the mansions of Clinton Avenue, built in the 1870s and 1880s. The most prominent of these are linked to Charles Pratt, who built a mansion for himself at 232 Clinton Avenue in 1874, the year his Charles Pratt & Company was acquired by Standard Oil, and one each as wedding presents for three of his four sons. These four mansions can be seen on Clinton Avenue between DeKalb and Willoughby. The rest of the historic district is noted for its prominent Italianate and Beaux-Arts rowhouses. The Clinton Hill South Historic District was listed in 1986. St. Mary's Episcopal Church at 220 Classon Avenue in Clinton Hill, built c.1859, and the Mechanics Temple, which was built at 67 Putnam Avenue as the Lincoln Club in 1889, are both part of the historic district. Other buildings in the Historic District include a Gothic Revival wooden house at 284 Clinton Avenue, built c.1854; an Italianate brick and stone villa dating from c.1850 at 447 Clinton Avenue, intact runs of mid-19th century rowhouses on Grand Avenue, St. James Place and Cambridge Place as well as on DeKalb Avenue and Waverly Avenue; mansions from the \\"Gold Coast\\" era in the 200 to 400 blocks of Clinton Avenue;At 229, 232, 241, 245, 278, 284, 300, 315, 321, 356, 380, 384, 404 & 406, 405, 410, 415, 443, 447, 457, 463 and 487 Clinton Avenue and at 367 Washington Avenue; and apartment houses on Clinton Avenue. On Lafayette Avenue can be found both the Emmanuel Baptist Church, completed in 1887, and the Joseph Steele or Steele- Skinner House of 1812, while Clinton Avenue offers the Church of St. Luke and St. Matthew (1891) and the Royal Castle Apartments, completed in 1912. All are individually landmarked., pp.242-245 Many of the buildings of the Pratt Institute are landmarked, or of architectural interest, and St. Joseph's College utilizes several of the former Pratt family mansions on Clinton Avenue.

During the Russian Civil War the White movement functioned as a big-tent political movement representing an array of political opinions in Russia united in their opposition to the communist Bolsheviks‚Äîfrom the republican-minded liberals and Kerenskyite social- democrats on the left through monarchists and supporters of a united multinational Russia to the ultra-nationalist Black Hundreds on the right. Following the military defeat of the Whites, remnants and continuations of the movement remained in several organizations, some of which only had narrow support, enduring within the wider White √©migr√© overseas community until after the fall of the European communist states in the Eastern European Revolutions of 1989 and the subsequent dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1990‚Äì1991. This community-in-exile of anti-communists often divided into liberal and the more conservative segments, with some still hoping for the restoration of the Romanov dynasty. Two claimants to the empty throne emerged during the Civil War, Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich of Russia and Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (1856‚Äì1929).  Structure and ideology  In the Russian context after 1917, \\"White\\" had three main connotations: # Political contra- distinction to \\"the Reds\\", whose revolutionary Red Army supported the Bolshevik government. # Historical reference to absolute monarchy, specifically recalling Russia's first Tsar, Ivan III (reigned 1462‚Äì1505), at a period when some styled the ruler of Muscovy Albus Rex (\\"the White King\\"). # The white uniforms of Imperial Russia worn by some White Army soldiers. = Ideology = Female White officers in late 1917 Above all, the White movement emerged as opponents of the Red Army. The White Army had the stated aim to keep law and order in Russia as the Tsar's army before the civil war and the revolution of Russia.Christopher Lazarski, \\"White Propaganda Efforts in the South during the Russian Civil War, 1918‚Äì19 (The Alekseev-Denikin Period)\\", The Slavonic and East European Review, Vol. 70, No. 4 (Oct., 1992), pp. 688‚Äì707. They worked to remove Soviet organizations and functionaries in White-controlled territory.Viktor G. Bortnevski, \\"White Administration and White Terror (The Denikin Period)\\", Russian Review, Vol. 52, No. 3 (Jul., 1993), pp. 354‚Äì366. Overall, the White Army was nationalistic and rejected ethnic particularism and separatism.Christopher Lazarski, \\"White Propaganda Efforts,\\" 689. The White Army generally believed in a united multinational Russia and opposed separatists who wanted to create nation-states. British parliamentary influential leader Winston Churchill (1874‚Äì1965) personally warned General Anton Denikin (1872‚Äì1947), formerly of the Imperial Army and later a major White military leader, whose forces effected pogroms and persecutions against the Jews: > [M]y task in winning support in Parliament for the Russian Nationalist cause > will be infinitely harder if well-authenticated complaints continue to be > received from Jews in the zone of the Volunteer Armies. Coat of Arms of the Kolchak government Many of the White leaders accepted autocracy while remaining suspicious of \\"politics,\\" which they characterized as consisting of speeches, elections, and party activities. Aside from being anti-Bolshevik and anti-CommunistChristopher Lazarski, \\"White Propaganda Efforts,\\" 690. and patriotic, the Whites had no set ideology or main leader. The White Armies did acknowledge a single provisional head of state in a Supreme Governor of Russia in a Provisional All-Russian Government, but this post was prominent only under the leadership in the war campaigns during 1918‚Äì1920 of Admiral Alexander Kolchak, formerly of the previous Russian Imperial Navy. The movement had no set foreign policy. Whites differed on policies toward the German Empire in its extended occupation of western Russia, the Baltic states, Poland and the Ukraine on the Eastern Front in the closing days of the World War, debating whether or not to ally with it. The Whites wanted to keep from alienating any potential supporters and allies and thus saw an exclusively monarchist position as a detriment to their cause and recruitment. White-movement leaders, such as Anton Denikin, advocated for Russians to create their own government, claiming the military could not decide in Russians' steads. Admiral Alexander Kolchak succeeded in creating a temporary wartime government in Omsk, acknowledged by most other White leaders, only for it to fall with the loss of his armies. Some warlords who were aligned with the White movement, such as Grigory Semyonov and Roman Ungern von Sternberg, did not acknowledge any authority but their own. Consequently, the White movement had no unifying political convictions, as members could be monarchists, republicans, rightists, or Kadets.Kenez, Peter, Civil War, 90. Among White Army leaders, neither General Lavr Kornilov nor General Anton Denikin were monarchists, yet General Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel was a monarchist willing to soldier for a republican Russian government. Moreover, other political parties supported the anti-Bolshevik White Army, among them the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, and others who opposed Lenin's Bolshevik October Revolution of 1917. Depending on the time and place, those White Army supporters might also exchange right-wing allegiance for allegiance to the Red Army. Unlike the Bolsheviks, the White Armies did not share a single ideology, methodology, or political goal. They were led by conservative generals with different agendas and methods, and for the most part they operated quite independently of each other, with little coordination or cohesion. The composition and command structure of White armies also varied, some containing hardened veterans of World War I, others more recent volunteers. These differences and divisions, along with their inability to offer an alternative government and win popular support, prevented the White armies from winning the Civil War. = Structure =  White Army  \\"Why aren't you in the army?\\", Volunteer Army recruiting poster during the Russian Civil War 8th Army), later became the Volunteer Army's elite Shock Regiment The Volunteer Army in South Russia became the most prominent and the largest of the various and disparate White forces. Starting off as a small and well- organized military in January 1918, the Volunteer Army soon grew. The Kuban Cossacks joined the White Army and conscription of both peasants and Cossacks began. In late February 1918, soldiers under the command of General Aleksei Kaledin were forced to retreat from Rostov-on-Don due to the advance of the Red Army. In what became known as the Ice March, they traveled to Kuban in order to unite with the Kuban Cossacks, most of whom did not support the Volunteer Army. In March, men under the command of General Viktor Pokrovsky joined the Volunteer Army, increasing its membership to , and by June to . In 1919 the Don Cossacks joined the Army. In that year between May and October, the Volunteer Army grew from to soldiers and was better supplied than its Red counterpart.Kenez, Peter, Civil War, 18‚Äì22. The White Army's rank-and-file comprised active anti-Bolsheviks, such as Cossacks, nobles, and peasants, as conscripts and as volunteers. The White movement had access to various naval forces, both seagoing and riverine, especially the Black Sea Fleet. Aerial forces available to the Whites included the Slavo-British Aviation Corps (S.B.A.C.). The Russian ace Alexander Kazakov operated within this unit.  Administration  The White movement's leaders and first membersKenez, Peter, Civil War, 18. came mainly from the ranks of military officers. Many came from outside the nobility, such as generals Mikhail Alekseev and Anton Denikin, who originated in serf families, or General Lavr Kornilov, a Cossack. The White generals never mastered administration; they often utilized \\"prerevolutionary functionaries\\" or \\"military officers with monarchististic inclinations\\" for administering White-controlled regions.Viktor G. Bortnevski, White Administration and White Terror, 360. The White Armies were often lawless and disordered. Also, White-controlled territories had multiple different and varying currencies with unstable exchange-rates. The chief currency, the Volunteer Army's ruble, had no gold backing.Kenez, Peter, Civil War, 94‚Äì95.  Theatres of operation  Russian Civil War in the west The Whites and the Reds fought the Russian Civil War from November 1917 until 1921, and isolated battles continued in the Far East until 1923. The White Army‚Äîaided by the Allied forces (Triple Entente) from countries such as Japan, the United Kingdom, France, Italy and the United States and (sometimes) the Central Powers forces such as Germany and Austria-Hungary‚Äîfought in Siberia, Ukraine, and the Crimea. They were defeated by the Red Army due to military and ideological disunity, as well as the determination and increasing unity of the Red Army. The White Army operated in three main theatres: = Southern front = In the summer of 1919, Denikin's troops captured Kharkov White organising in the South started on 15 November 1917, (Old Style) under General Mikhail Alekseev (1857‚Äì1918). In December 1917, General Lavr Kornilov took over the military command of the newly named Volunteer Army until his death in April 1918, after which General Anton Denikin took over, becoming head of the \\"Armed Forces of the South of Russia\\" in January 1919. The Southern Front featured massive-scale operations and posed the most dangerous threat to the Bolshevik Government. At first it depended entirely upon volunteers in Russia proper, mostly the Cossacks, among the first to oppose the Bolshevik Government. On 23 June 1918, the Volunteer Army (8,000‚Äì9,000 men) began its so-called Second Kuban Campaign with support from Pyotr Krasnov. By September, the Volunteer Army comprised 30,000 to 35,000 members, thanks to mobilization of the Kuban Cossacks gathered in the North Caucasus. Thus, the Volunteer Army took the name of the Caucasus Volunteer Army. On 23 January 1919, the Volunteer Army under Denikin oversaw the defeat of the 11th Soviet Army and then captured the North Caucasus region. After capturing the Donbass, Tsaritsyn and Kharkov in June, Denikin's forces launched an attack towards Moscow on 3 July, (N.S.). Plans envisaged 40,000 fighters under the command of General Vladimir May-Mayevsky storming the city. After General Denikin's attack upon Moscow failed in 1919, the Armed Forces of the South of Russia retreated. On 26 and 27 March 1920, the remnants of the Volunteer Army evacuated from Novorossiysk to the Crimea, where they merged with the army of Pyotr Wrangel. = Eastern (Siberian) front = The Eastern Front started in spring 1918 as a secret movement among army officers and right-wing socialist forces. In that front, they launched an attack in collaboration with the Czechoslovak Legions, who were then stranded in Siberia by the Bolshevik Government, who had barred them from leaving Russia, and with the Japanese, who also intervened to help the Whites in the east. Admiral Alexander Kolchak headed the eastern White counter-revolutionary army and a provisional Russian government. Despite some significant success in 1919, the Whites were defeated being forced back to Far Eastern Russia, where they continued fighting until October 1922. When the Japanese withdrew, the Soviet army of the Far Eastern Republic retook the territory. The Civil War was officially declared over at this point, although Anatoly Pepelyayev still controlled the Ayano-Maysky District at that time. Pepelyayev's Yakut revolt, which concluded on 16 June 1923, represented the last military action in Russia by a White Army. It ended with the defeat of the final anti-communist enclave in the country, signalling the end of all military hostilities relating to the Russian Civil War. = Northern and Northwestern fronts = Headed by Nikolai Yudenich, Evgeni Miller, and Anatoly Lieven, the White forces in the North demonstrated less co-ordination than General Denikin's Army of Southern Russia. The Northwestern Army allied itself with Estonia, while Lieven's West Russian Volunteer Army sided with the Baltic nobility. Adventurers led by Pavel Bermondt-Avalov and Stanis≈Çaw Bu≈Çak-Ba≈Çachowicz played a role as well. The most notable operation on this front, Operation White Sword, saw an unsuccessful advance towards the Russian capital of Petrograd in the autumn of 1919.  Post-Civil War  Blagoveshchensky Temple, a Russian Orthodox Church in Harbin White propaganda poster The defeated anti-Bolshevik Russians went into exile, congregating in Belgrade, Berlin, Paris, Harbin, Istanbul, and Shanghai. They established military and cultural networks that lasted through World War II (1939‚Äì1945), e.g., the Russian community in Harbin and the Russian community in Shanghai. Afterward, the White Russians' anti-Communist activists established a home base in the United States, to which numerous refugees emigrated. Emblem used by white √©migr√© volunteers in the Spanish Civil War Moreover, in the 1920s and the 1930s the White Movement established organisations outside Russia, which were meant to depose the Soviet Government with guerrilla warfare, e.g., the Russian All-Military Union, the Brotherhood of Russian Truth, and the National Alliance of Russian Solidarists, a far-right anticommunist organization founded in 1930 by a group of young White emigres in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. Some White √©migr√©s adopted pro-Soviet sympathies and were termed \\"Soviet patriots\\". These people formed organizations such as the Mladorossi, the Eurasianists, and the Smenovekhovtsy. A Russian cadet corps was established to prepare the next generation of anti-Communists for the \\"spring campaign\\"‚Äîa hopeful term denoting a renewed military campaign to reconquer Russia from the Soviet Government. In any event, many cadets volunteered to fight for the Russian Corps during the Second World War, when some White Russians participated in the Russian Liberation Movement. Oleg Beyda, 'Iron Cross of the Wrangel's Army': Russian Emigrants as Interpreters in the Wehrmacht, Journal of Slavic Military Studies 27, no. 3 (2014): 430‚Äì448. After the war, active anti-Soviet combat was almost exclusively continued by the National Alliance of Russian Solidarists. Other organizations either dissolved, or began concentrating exclusively on self-preservation and/or educating the youth. Various youth organizations, such as the Russian Scouts-in-Exteris, promoted providing children with a background in pre-Soviet Russian culture and heritage. Some supported Zog I of Albania during the 1920s and a few independently served with the Nationalists during the Spanish Civil War. White Russians also served alongside the Soviet Red Army during the Soviet invasion of Xinjiang and the Islamic rebellion in Xinjiang in 1937.

Civil wars followed, wherein the anti-Communist side may be referred to as White Armies, e.g. the White Guard-led, partially conscripted army in Finland (valkoinen armeija). However, since they were nationalists, their aims were substantially different from the Russian White Army proper; for instance, Russian White generals never supported Finnish independence. The defeat of the Russian White Army made the point moot in this dispute. The countries remained independent and governed by non-Communist governments.

It is bordered on the southwest by Williamsburg at Bushwick Inlet Park and McCarren Park; on the southeast by the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway and East Williamsburg; on the north by Newtown Creek and the neighborhood of Long Island City in Queens; and on the west by the East River. The neighborhood has a large Polish immigrant and Polish- American community, containing many Polish restaurants, markets, and businesses, and it is often referred to as Little Poland. Originally farmland ‚Äì many of the farm owners' family names, such as Meserole (Messerole) and Calyer, are current street names ‚Äì the residential core of Greenpoint was built on parcels divided during the 19th century, with rope factories and lumber yards lining the East River to the west, while the northeastern section along the Newtown Creek through East Williamsburg became an industrial maritime area. Greenpoint has long held a reputation of being a working class and immigrant neighborhood, and it initially attracted families and workers with its abundance of factory jobs, heavy industry and manufacturing, and longshoreman or dock work. Since the early 2000s, a building boom in the neighborhood has made the neighborhood increasingly a center of nightlife and gentrification, and a 2005 rezoning enabled the construction of high density residential buildings on the East River waterfront. There have also been efforts to reclaim the rezoned East River waterfront for recreational use and also to extend a continuous promenade into the Newtown Creek area. Greenpoint is part of Brooklyn Community District 1, and its primary ZIP Code is 11222. It is patrolled by the 94th Precinct of the New York City Police Department. History =Early colonization and agricultural era= At the time of European settlement in New York, Greenpoint was inhabited by the Keskachauge (Keshaechqueren) Indians, a sub-tribe of the Lenape. Contemporary accounts describe the area as remarkably verdant and beautiful, with Jack pine and oak forest, meadows, fresh water creeks and briny marshes. Water fowl and fish were abundant. European settlers originally used the \\"Greenpoint\\" name to refer to a small bluff of land jutting into the East River at what is now the westernmost end of Freeman Street, but eventually it came to describe the whole peninsula.Felter, William L., Historic Green Point, Green Point Savings Bank: 1918. pg. 14. Cited in \\"A Greenpoint Perspective\\" by Frank J. Dmuchowski In 1638, the Dutch West India Company negotiated the right to settle Brooklyn from the Lenape. The first recorded European settler of what is now Greenpoint was Dirck Volckertsen (Batavianized from Holgerss√∏n), a Norwegian immigrant who in 1645 built a -story farmhouse there with the help of two Dutch carpenters. It was built in the contemporary Dutch style just west of what is now the intersection of Calyer Street and Franklin Street. There he planted orchards and raised crops, sheep and cattle. He was called Dirck de Noorman by the Dutch colonists of the region, Noorman being the Dutch word for \\"Norseman\\" or \\"Northman.\\" The creek that ran by his farmhouse became known as Norman Kill (Creek); it ran into a large salt marsh and was later filled in. Volckertsen received title to the land after prevailing in court one year earlier over a Jan De Pree, who had a rival claim. He initially commuted to his farm by boat and may not have moved into the house full time until after 1655, when the small nearby settlement of Boswyck was established, on the charter of which Volckertsen was listed along with 22 other families. Volckertsen's wife, Christine Vigne, was a Walloon. Volckertsen had had periodic conflicts with the Keshaechqueren, who killed two of his sons-in-law and tortured a third in separate incidents throughout the 1650s. Starting in the early 1650s, he began selling and leasing his property to Dutch colonists, among them Jacob Haie (Hay) in 1653, who built a home in northern Greenpoint that was burned down by Indians two years later. Jan Meserole established a farm in 1663; his farmhouse at what is now 723 Manhattan Avenue stood until 1919 and last served as a Young Women‚Äôs Hebrew Association.\\"Building of the Day: 723 Manhattan Avenue\\" by Montrose Morris, in Brownstoner, July 30, 2014. The Hay property and other holdings came into the possession of Pieter Praa, a captain in the local militia, who established a farm near present day Freeman Street and McGuinness Boulevard, and went on to own most of Greenpoint. Volckertsen died in about 1678 and his grandsons sold the remainder of the homestead to Pieter Praa when their father died in 1718; the name of Norman Avenue remains as testimony to Volckertsen's legacy.Felter, William L., Historic Green Point, Green Point Savings Bank: 1918. pg. 19. Cited in \\"A Greenpoint Perspective\\" by Frank J. Dmuchowski Praa had no male heirs when he died in 1740, but the farming families of his various daughters formed the core of Greenpoint for the next hundred years or so. By the time of the American Revolutionary War, Greenpoint's population was entirely five related families: * Abraham Meserole, a grandson of Pieter Praa, and his family lived on the banks of the East River between the present day India and Java Streets; * Jacob Meserole (brother of Abraham) and his family farmed the entire south end of Greenpoint and built a house between present day Manhattan Avenue and Lorimer Street near Norman Avenue; * Jacob Bennett, son-in-law of Pieter Praa, and his family farmed the land in the northern portion of Greenpoint and built their house near present day Clay Street roughly between present day Manhattan Avenue and Franklin Street; * Jonathan Provoost, son-in-law of Pieter Praa, and his family farmed the eastern portion of Greenpoint, and lived in the house built by Praa; * Jacobus Calyer, a grandson-in-law of Pieter Praa, and his family farmed the western portion of Greenpoint, and lived in the house built by Volckertsen. The British Army had an encampment in Greenpoint during the American Revolution, which caused considerable hardship for the families; Abraham Meserole's son was imprisoned on suspicion of revolutionary sympathies. Throughout the 18th and early 19th centuries, the farms were quite isolated from the rest of Brooklyn, connected only to one another by farm lanes and to the rest of Bushwick Township by a single road, Wood Point Road (now Bushwick Avenue). The families used long boats to travel to Manhattan to sell their farm produce. Little historical information exists about this period of Greenpoint's history other than the personal papers and recorded oral history of these five families. =19th-century industrialization= The Greenpoint Wood Exchange, where lumber is processed Greenpoint first began to change significantly when entrepreneur Neziah Bliss married into the Meserole family in the early 1830s after purchasing land from them. He eventually bought out most of the land in Greenpoint. In 1834 he had the area surveyed, and in 1839 opened a public turnpike along what is now Franklin Street. He established regular ferry service to Manhattan around 1850. All of these initiatives contributed to the rapid and radical transformation of Greenpoint, which was annexed to the City of Brooklyn in 1855.Gentrification and Inequality in Brooklyn: The New Kids on the Block, by Judith N. DeSena Pg 21, Google Books In the years that followed Greenpoint established itself as a manufacturing district. Its largest industries were shipbuilding, porcelain and pottery, and glassworks, but the area had other industrial concerns such as brass and iron foundries; breweries; drug plants; book, furniture, box, and boiler makers; sugar refineries; and machine shops. Germans and Irish arrived in the mid-19th century and large numbers of Poles began arriving before the turn of the century. The homes built for the merchants and the buildings erected for their workers sprang up along streets that lead down to the waterfront. Today, this area is on the National Register of Historic Places as the Greenpoint Historic District. Greenpoint's East River waterfront holds the maritime history of the community. The buildings that formerly manufactured the ropes for the shipbuilding industry are still there. Long a site of shipbuilding, the neighborhood's dockyards were used to build the USS Monitor‚Äîthe Union's first ironclad fighting ship built during the American Civil War. It was launched on Bushwick Creek. The Monitor, together with seven other ironclads, was built at the Continental Ironworks in Greenpoint. In 1866, the largest wooden ship ever built up to that time, The Great Republic, was built along Newtown Creek. Glass-making was also a large industry in Greenpoint, and by the 1880s the neighborhood housed 18 of the 20 glass makers in the city of Brooklyn, as well as all of the porcelain and pottery manufacturers in the city. Charles Pratt's Astral Oil Works also opened on the Greenpoint waterfront in the 1860s. Pratt sold his interest to John D. Rockefeller's recently formed Standard Oil Trust in 1874. By 1875 Greenpoint had some 50 refineries. The Astral Apartments were built as housing for workers at Astral Oil in 1886. An American manufacturer of porcelain wares who operated between 1862 to 1922, the Union Porcelain Works, had their factory located at 300 Eckford Street in Greenpoint. According to the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designation report the company was \\"one of the most famous in the country, both for its innovative approach to the manufacture of porcelain and for the quality of its products which was highly regarded on both sides of the Atlantic\\" and was \\"a major force in shaping an American stylistic tradition for ceramics and porcelain\\". =20th and 21st centuries= Public library (demolished 2017) The petroleum industry continued to expand, despite the occasional catastrophe. On September 13, 1919, the Standard Oil refinery caught fire and soon spread flaming liquids into neighboring oil works and Newtown Creek. In 1933 Greenpoint gained access to the New York City Subway, with the opening of the IND Crosstown Line (currently serving the ), running under Manhattan Avenue from Nassau Avenue to Queens. In 1937 the line was extended to Downtown Brooklyn, providing direct access from Greenpoint to points south. The manufacturing industry of Greenpoint declined after World War II. Eberhard Faber's pencil factory, once the largest manufacturer of lead pencils in the United States, operated on West Street from 1872 until 1956. The company's former buildings were designated a historic district by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 2007. The Greenpoint Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Environmental difficulties and litigation Aerial picture of Greenpoint's East River waterfront, with Manhattan in background Greenpoint community residents and activists have periodically banded together, sometimes with the aid of their local representatives, to fight highly polluting facilities and practices in the neighborhood. Such organization led the city to close the huge Greenpoint incinerator in 1994, which was out of compliance with all city, state and federal regulations. In the late-1980s, after an increasing series of highly odorous releases from the Sewage Treatment Plant which served a good portion of Lower Manhattan, a local group formed calling itself GASP (Greenpointers Against Smell Pollution) that compelled the city to control the outflows and to plan a vastly expanded facility that took 20 years to build. The mid 1980s saw a great increase in the number of trucks driving through the neighborhood with municipal waste, often toxic waste, to be held at \\"transfer stations.\\" During the 1950 Greenpoint oil spill, at the time the largest oil spill in United States history, of oil spilled into Newtown Creek. Oil is believed to have been seeping into the groundwater since then. Groundwater in this area is not used as drinking water, as all of New York City's drinking water presently comes from upstate reservoirs. However, local activists have been campaigning ever since to clean up the spill. In January 2006, state and oil company officials asserted that to date half of the spill had been cleaned up. According to an Environmental Protection Agency study, \\"the American Petroleum Institute (2002) indicates that 40% to 80% of a product spill may be retained in soils as residual product.\\").\\"Newtown Creek/Greenpoint Oil Spill Study Brooklyn, New York\\", U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, September 12, 2007 The Department of Environmental Conservation's website states that petroleum companies participating in the cleanup have used a Free Product Recovery System for groundwater, rather than the soils. On October 20, 2005, local residents within the area of the oil recovery operation, which is located in the predominantly commercial/industrial eastern section of Greenpoint near the East Williamsburg Industrial Park, filed a lawsuit against ExxonMobil, BP and Chevron Corporation in Brooklyn State Supreme Court, alleging they have suffered adverse health consequences. Such claims from residents have been resisted by oil industry supporters through references to apparently conflicting data and deferrals of legal responsibility, among other strategies. For example, a New York State Department of Health study, completed in May 2007, was able to find no evidence that vapors were coming from the spill into people's homes.Dept of Health Study confirms no vapors from 50 Year Old Oil Spill., Newswire, May 30, 2007 Although ExxonMobil has been slowly removing oil from its former facilities in the area under two 1990 agreements with the state, they have denied liability for the oil leaking into Newtown Creek and suggested fault lies instead with the former Paragon Oil, now Chevron Corporation. However, the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) \\"Newtown Creek/Greenpoint Oil Spill Study Brooklyn, New York\\" states that vapor concentrations in \\"some commercial establishments\\" were found \\"above the Upper Explosive Limit\\" (page 7).EPA study finds vapor in Greenpoint businesses \\"above Upper Explosive Limit.\\" sic]sic]sic]sic], U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, September 12, 2007 Simply put, that means there was so much vapor, no explosion could ignite. In addition, the same EPA study said, \\"A review of the data collected by the NYSDEC shows that, in general, chemicals were detected at all locations in each home, but not in a pattern that would typically represent a vapor intrusion phenomenon.\\" A recent Department of Environmental Conservation report that tested residential blocks above the spill area concluded that there is no evidence of either oil or dangerous vapors seeping up into people's homes. Brooklyn Paper columnist Tom Gilbert wrote, \\"This stands to reason, as the spilled oil tends to lie deep underground, capped by a nearly impermeable layer of clay.\\"Is G'point good for you?, The Brooklyn Paper, October 27, 2007 The cancer rates recorded by the NY State Dept of Health in Greenpoint average 10% lower than the rest of the city, along with a 25% and 50% lower asthma rate.New York State Department of Health, New York State Cancer Registry, NY.gov, 2009 Cancer and asthma rates may be dropping as a result of the closure of highly toxic industries such as electroplating. 2005 rezoning Condominiums being built in Greenpoint On May 11, 2005, New York City's Department of City Planning approved a rezoning of 175 blocks in Greenpoint and Williamsburg.Greenpoint/Williamsburg Rezoning Overview . New York City Department of City Planning. According to the project's Environmental Impact Statement, the rezoning is expected to bring approximately 16,700 new residents to the neighborhood by 2013 in 7,300 new units of housing. of new retail space are projected, along with a corresponding loss of just over of existing industrial capacity.Greenpoint/Williamsburg Rezoning EIS . New York City Department of City Planning. The rezoning also includes a waterfront park. Included in its requirements are provisions for a promenade along the East River, built piecemeal by the developers of existing waterfront lots. An inclusionary housing plan was included in the resolution and provides height bonuses along the waterfront and in Northside Williamsburg for developers providing apartments at rates considered affordable for low-income households (below 80% of the area's median income); on the waterfront, these bonuses could allow for up to seven-story height increases.Greenpoint/Williamsburg Inclusionary Housing Program . New York City Department of City Planning. The rezoning was a dramatic change in scale to a previously low-slung, industrial neighborhood. The proposed changes were the subject of much debate, including a letter written by activist Jane Jacobs to mayor Michael Bloomberg criticizing the proposed development.\\"Letter to Mayor Bloomberg and the City Council\\". Jane Jacobs, The Brooklyn Rail, April 15, 2005. Other organizations, including the city government and various advocacy groups such as the Manhattan Institute, argued that residential construction in underused manufacturing zones is essential to meet growing housing demand.\\"Up From the Ruins: Why Rezoning New York City's Manufacturing Areas for Housing Makes Sense\\", The Manhattan Institute, June 2, 2005. Rezoning promised double-digit percentage growth in the number of housing units, leading these groups to claim that it would help to alleviate the city's housing shortage and possibly slow rent increases. Critics argued that the existing community's character would be changed as existing residents were forced to move, and, further, that public transportation and public safety infrastructure would be unable to accommodate the projected 40,000 new residents. A boom in construction followed the rezoning, leading to complaints from neighborhood residents and their elected representatives. The zoning plan was modified on March 2, 2006, to include anti-harassment provisions for tenants and add height limits in portions of upland Williamsburg. Neighborhood organizations made differing opinions known: the Greenpoint-Williamsburg Association for Parks and Planning expressed approval of the proposal (with reservations),\\"Summary of Approved Zoning Changes for Greenpoint/Williamsburg .\\" Greenpoint/Williamsburg Association for Parks and Planning. but many neighborhood residents and members of Community Board 1 continue to voice their objections.\\"Proposed Grand St. Rezoning, a Step in the Right Direction for Williamsburg.\\" Block Magazine, February 1, 2008. One of the largest developments to be built after the rezoning was Greenpoint Landing, which includes ten residential towers containing 5,500 units, a public elementary and middle school, and of parkland. Greenpoint Landing began construction in 2015 and is expected to be completed before 2027.

The site originally housed a Carnegie library that opened in 1906, but it was replaced in the 1970s. The library closed in mid-2017 for a two-year renovation, which would necessitate the replacement of the existing building with a new facility called the Greenpoint Library & Environmental Education Center. The renovation of the Greenpoint branch was originally supposed to be completed in late 2018, but was delayed because of safety violations during construction. Transportation Greenpoint is served by the Greenpoint Avenue and Nassau Avenue stations on the IND Crosstown Line () of the New York City Subway. It is served by the New York City Bus routes. In June 2011, NY Waterway started service to points along the East River. On May 1, 2017, that route became part of the NYC Ferry's East River route, which runs between Pier 11/Wall Street in Manhattan's Financial District and the East 34th Street Ferry Landing in Murray Hill, Manhattan, with five intermediate stops in Brooklyn and Queens. Greenpoint is served by the East River Ferry's India Street stop. There are plans to build the Brooklyn‚ÄìQueens Connector (BQX), a light rail system that would run along the waterfront from Red Hook through Greenpoint to Astoria in Queens. However, the system is projected to cost $2.7 billion, and the projected opening has been delayed until at least 2029.  Landmarks and attractions  St Anthony of Padua Church = Street grid = When Neziah Bliss created Greenpoint, he named the east-west streets in alphabetical order from north to south. Originally, these streets were simply given lettered names such as \\"A Street\\" and \\"B Street\\", but in the mid-19th century, the streets were given longer names. This system persists today with a few exceptions: Ash, Box, Clay, Dupont, Eagle, Freeman, Green, Huron, India, Java, Kent, Greenpoint (Avenue), Milton, Noble, Oak, Calyer, and Quay Streets. (map) Greenpoint Avenue was formerly named Lincoln Street. There would have been a street starting with the letter \\"P\\" between Oak and Quay Streets, but it was named Calyer Street early in Greenpoint's history, after the patriarch of a nearby family. = Parks = Parks include McCarren Park (formerly known as Greenpoint Park), the neighborhood's largest green space, and the smaller McGolrick Park (formerly known as Winthrop Park), which contains both the landmarked Shelter Pavilion (1910) and an allegorical monument to the ironclad ship USS Monitor (1938). On the East River, WNYC Transmitter Park opened in 2012 on the site of a former radio transmission antenna. A small playground called \\"Right Angle Park\\" is located at Commercial, Dupont, and Franklin Streets, so named because the park is located on a city block that is shaped like a right triangle.Church of the Ascension, built in 1853 = Architectural and historic landmarks = The Greenpoint Historic District is roughly bounded by Kent, Calyer, Noble, and Franklin Streets, Clifford Place, Lorimer Street and Manhattan Avenue.P.S. 34 Of architectural interest in Greenpoint are: the Episcopal Church of the Ascension (1853), the oldest church in Greenpoint on Kent Street; the Astral Apartments (1885) on Franklin Street; the Saint Anthony of Padua Roman Catholic Church (1875) on Manhattan Avenue; the Eberhard Faber Pencil Factory on Greenpoint Avenue at Franklin Street; the Russian Orthodox Cathedral of the Transfiguration of Our Lord (1921) on North 12th Street; PS 34, the Oliver H. Perry School (1867) on Norman Avenue (the oldest continuously operating public school building in New York City); the Capital One (formerly Green Point) Savings Bank (1908); the Saint Stanislaus Kostka Roman Catholic Church (1896)http://ststanskostka.org/wordpress/ on Humboldt Street, which serves as a Catholic shrine for the Polish community; and the synagogue building of Congregation Ahavas Israel (1903) on Noble Streethttp://www.greenpointshul.org (the sanctuary, with stained glass windows and a Torah ark with turn of the century wood carvings, is currently open only during services on Saturday mornings). A commercial building called Keramos Hall, on Manhattan Avenue, was restored and won a Lucy G. Moses Preservation Award from the New York Landmarks Conservancy in 2013. The conservancy wrote: \\"Picturesque features had been hidden under asbestos shingles for decades, but when owners discovered a vintage photograph, they began putting funds aside for this work. Now, the revelation of the Stick Style fa√ßade, Italianate roof tower, and Swiss Chalet brackets stops passersby in their tracks.\\" The Kickstarter headquarters, located in Greenpoint, is housed in the former Eberhart Faber Pencil Factory on Kent Street, which was renovated in 2013‚Äì2014. The restoration received a Moses Preservation Award as well as a MASterworks Award from the Municipal Art Society. St. Cecilia's Roman Catholic Church and School, on Monitor Street between Richardson and Herbert Streets, has served the community since 1871. The school, which dates to 1906, was closed in June 2008. The current church building dates to 1891.

It was situated in a river valley near the coast. Its ruins are located south of the modern town √áƒ±ralƒ± in the Kumluca district of Antalya Province, Turkey. Together with the sites of the ancient cities Phaselis and Idyros it is part of the Olympos Beydaglari National Park. The perpetual gas fires at Yanarta≈ü are found a few kilometers to the northwest of the site.  History  The ruins of the bathhouse are seen on the other side of the river A street of the ancient city Sarcophagus of captain Eudemos The exact date of the city's foundation is unknown. A wall and an inscription on a sarcophagus have been dated to the end of the 4th century BC, so Olympus must have been founded at the latest in the Hellenistic period. The city presumably taking its name from nearby Mount Olympus (, Timber Mountain), one of over twenty mountains with the name Olympus in the Classical world. The city was a member of the Lycian League, but it is uncertain when it joined the League. It started minting Lycian League coins from the end of the second century BC, possibly the 130s. At this time Olympus was one of the six largest cities of the League, which possessed three votes each. Around 100 BC Olympus started issuing its own coins separate from the League. At this point the Cilician pirates had taken control his possessions, which included Corycus, Phaselis and many other places in Pamphylia. His rule ended in 78 BC, when the Roman commander Publius Servilius Isauricus, accompanied by the young Julius Caesar, captured Olympus and his other territories after a victory at sea. At his defeat Zenicetes set fire to his own house and perished. At the time of the Roman conquest Olympus was described by Cicero as a rich and highly decorated city. Olympus then became part of the Roman Republic. The emperor Hadrian visited the city after which it took the name of Hadrianopolis (·ºâŒ¥œÅŒπŒ±ŒΩŒøœçœÄŒøŒªŒπœÇ) for a period, in his honour. Olympus is missing from the Stadiasmus Patarensis and the Stadiasmus Maris Magni. However, both include the already mentioned Corycus, which is described in ancient sources as a port of some significance. There is no evidence that Olympus was a maritime city prior to the 2nd century AD. On this basis Mustafa Adak has argued that Olympus was initially founded on Mount Olympus, which he identifies as Musa Daƒüƒ± instead of Tahtalƒ± Daƒüƒ±. In his theory, the Romans destroyed Olympus, after which the population moved to Corycus, and the name of Corycus was changed to Olympus when Hadrian visited the city in 131 AD. In the Middle Ages, Venetians, Genoese and Rhodians built two fortresses along the coast, but by the 15th century Olympus had been abandoned. Today the site attracts tourists, not only for the artifacts that can still be found (though fragmentary and widely scattered), but also for its scenic landscapes supporting wild grapevines, flowering oleander, bay trees, figs and pines.  Bishopric  Olympus became a Christian bishopric, a suffragan of the metropolitan see of Myra, the capital of the Roman province of Lycia. Its earliest recorded bishop was Saint Methodius of OlympusSuda Encyclopedia, ¬ßmu.432, whose service at the head of church in Olympus extended from the late 3rd century to his martyrdom in about 311. Aristocritus was at the Council of Ephesus in 431 and the Council of Chalcedon in 451. Anatolius was a signatory of the joint letter that the bishops of Lycia sent in 458 to Byzantine Emperor Leo I the Thracian regarding the murder of Proterius of Alexandria. Ioannes took part in the synod convoked in 536 by Patriarch Menas of Constantinople.Michel Lequien, Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus, Paris 1740, Vol. I, coll. 975-978Pius Bonifacius Gams, Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae, Leipzig 1931, p. 449 Pseudo-Epiphanius writes that the Metropolis of Myra had 36 cities and/or bishops under it, including Olympus.Pseudo-Epiphanius, Notitia Episcopatuum, ¬ß4.17 No longer a residential bishopric, Olympus is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 944  Layout   Modern Times  √áamoda Peak, a peak of Omurga, as seen from the valley past the ruins Olympus is now a popular tourist area.

It is responsible for the stable appearance of object colors despite the wide variation of light which might be reflected from an object and observed by our eyes. A chromatic adaptation transform (CAT) function emulates this important aspect of color perception in color appearance models. An object may be viewed under various conditions. For example, it may be illuminated by sunlight, the light of a fire, or a harsh electric light. In all of these situations, human vision perceives that the object has the same color: a red apple always appears red, whether viewed at night or during the day. On the other hand, a camera with no adjustment for light may register the apple as having varying color. This feature of the visual system is called chromatic adaptation, or color constancy; when the correction occurs in a camera it is referred to as white balance. Though the human visual system generally does maintain constant perceived color under different lighting, there are situations where the relative brightness of two different stimuli will appear reversed at different illuminance levels. For example, the bright yellow petals of flowers will appear dark compared to the green leaves in dim light while the opposite is true during the day. This is known as the Purkinje effect, and arises because the peak sensitivity of the human eye shifts toward the blue end of the spectrum at lower light levels.  Von Kries transform  The von Kries chromatic adaptation method is a technique that is sometimes used in camera image processing. The method is to apply a gain to each of the human cone cell spectral sensitivity responses so as to keep the adapted appearance of the reference white constant. The application of Johannes von Kries's idea of adaptive gains on the three cone cell types was first explicitly applied to the problem of color constancy by Herbert E. Ives, (Reprinted in: ) and the method is sometimes referred to as the Ives transform or the von Kries‚ÄìIves adaptation. The von Kries coefficient rule rests on the assumption that color constancy is achieved by individually adapting the gains of the three cone responses, the gains depending on the sensory context, that is, the color history and surround. Thus, the cone responses c' from two radiant spectra can be matched by appropriate choice of diagonal adaptation matrices D1 and D2: :c'=D_1\\\\,S^T\\\\,f_1 = D_2\\\\,S^T\\\\,f_2 where S is the cone sensitivity matrix and f is the spectrum of the conditioning stimulus. This leads to the von Kries transform for chromatic adaptation in LMS color space (responses of long-, medium-, and short-wavelength cone response space): :D = D_1^{-1} D_2=\\\\begin{bmatrix} L_2/L_1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & M_2/M_1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & S_2/S_1 \\\\end{bmatrix} This diagonal matrix D maps cone responses, or colors, in one adaptation state to corresponding colors in another; when the adaptation state is presumed to be determined by the illuminant, this matrix is useful as an illuminant adaptation transform. The elements of the diagonal matrix D are the ratios of the cone responses (Long, Medium, Short) for the illuminant's white point. The more complete von Kries transform, for colors represented in XYZ or RGB color space, includes matrix transformations into and out of LMS space, with the diagonal transform D in the middle. CIE color appearance models  The International Commission on Illumination (CIE) has published a set of color appearance models, most of which included a color adaptation function. CIE L*a*b* (CIELAB) performs a \\"simple\\" von Kries-type transform in XYZ color space, while CIELUV uses a uses Judd-type (translational) white point adaptation. Two revisions of more comprehensive color appearance models, CIECAM97s and CIECAM02, each included a CAT function, CMCCAT97 and CAT02 respectively. CAT02's predecessor is a simplified version of CMCCAT97 known as CMCCAT2000.

The treaty was negotiated after investigation by the Indian Peace Commission, which in its final report in 1868 concluded that the wars had been preventable. They determined that the United States government and its representatives, including the United States Congress, had contributed to the warfare on the Great Plains by failing to fulfill their legal obligations and to treat the Native Americans with honesty. The U.S. government and tribal chiefs met at a place traditional for Native American ceremonies, at their request. The first treaty was signed October 21, 1867, with the Kiowa and Comanche tribes.\\"Treaty with the Kiowa and Comanche, 1867\\" (Medicine Lodge Treaty), 15 Stats. 581, October 21, 1867. The second, with the Kiowa-Apache,\\"Treaty with the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache, 1867\\" (Medicine Lodge Treaty), 15 Stats. 589, October 21, 1867. was signed the same day. The third treaty was signed with the Southern Cheyenne and Arapaho on October 28.\\"Treaty with the Cheyenne and Arapaho, 1867\\" (Medicine Lodge Treaty), 15 Stats. 593, October 28, 1867. Under the Medicine Lodge Treaty, the tribes were assigned reservations of diminished size compared to territories defined in an 1865 treaty. The treaty tribes never ratified the treaty by vote of adult males, as it required. In addition, by changing allotment policy under the Dawes Act and authorizing sales under the Agreement with the Cheyenne and Arapaho (1890) and the Agreement with the Comanche, Kiowa and Apache (1892) signed with the Cherokee Commission, the Congress effectively further reduced their reservation territory. The Kiowa chief Lone Wolf filed suit against the government for fraud on behalf of the tribes in Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock. In 1903 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against the tribes, determining that the Congress had \\"plenary power\\" and the political right to make such decisions.Pearson, Ellen Holmes. \\"Lone Wolf v Hitchcock.\\" Teachinghistory.org. Accessed July 11, 2011. In the aftermath of that case, Congress acted unilaterally on land decisions related to other reservations as well. Because of the outstanding issues with the treaty and subsequent government actions, in the mid-20th century, the Kiowa, Arapaho and Comanche filed several suits for claims against the U.S. government. Over decades, they won substantial settlements of monetary compensation in the amount of tens of millions of dollars, although it took years for the cases to be resolved.  Indian Peace Commission  On July 20, 1867, Congress established the Indian Peace Commission to negotiate peace with Plains Indian tribes who were warring with the United States.Greene 2004, p. 34.Cozzens 2003, p. xxvi. The Peace Commission met in St. Louis, Missouri, on August 6, 1867, where it elected Nathaniel G. Taylor, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, as its president. Commissioners agreed that lasting peace was contingent upon separating Indians regarded as \\"hostile\\" from those regarded as friendly, removing all Indian tribes onto reservations away from the routes of U.S. westward expansion, and making provision for their maintenance.Cozzens 2003, p. xxvii. The official report of the Commission to the President of the United States, dated January 7, 1868, describes detailed histories of the causes of the Indian Wars including: numerous social and legal injustices to Indians, repeated violations of numerous treaties, acts of corruption by many of the local agents, and culpability of Congress in failing to fulfill certain legal obligations. The report asserts that the Indian Wars were completely preventable had the United States government and its representatives acted with legal and moral honesty in dealing with the Indians.Indian Peace Commission 1868 Other members of the peace commission were Lieutenant General William T. Sherman, commander of the Military Division of the Missouri; Major General William S. Harney (retired), who had taken part in earlier conflicts with the Cheyenne and Sioux along the Platte River; Brigadier General Alfred H. Terry, commander of the Military Department of Dakota; Senator John B. Henderson of Missouri, Chairman of the Senate Indian Appropriations Committee, who had introduced the bill that created the peace commission; Colonel Samuel F. Tappan, formerly of the First Colorado Volunteer Cavalry and a peace advocate who had led the U.S. Army's investigation of the Sand Creek massacre; Major General John B. Sanborn, formerly commander of the Upper Arkansas District, who had previously helped to negotiate the Little Arkansas Treaty of 1865.Hoig 1980, p. 23.Cozzens 2003, p. 664. Sherman, having made public remarks indicating his disagreement with the peace policy, was called to Washington, D.C. and could not be present at the councils on the southern plains, including the council at Medicine Lodge Creek. Major General Christopher C. Augur, commander of the Military Department of the Platte, replaced him as a temporary appointment.  Medicine Lodge River councils  After an abortive meeting with northern Plains Indians in September, the commission gathered at Fort Leavenworth (Kansas) in early October and traveled from there by rail to Fort Harker.Hoig 1980, p. 24. There it was joined by an escort of five hundred troops of the 7th U.S. Cavalry RegimentGreene 2004, p. 36. and Battery B of the 4th artillery, armed with two Gatling guns. They were under the command of Maj. Joel H. Elliott, who had been excused from attending the court martial proceedings for Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer then underway at Fort Leavenworth. The commission was also accompanied by numerous newspaper reporters, who provided detailed coverage of the people and events related to the commission's work.Hoig 1980, p. 25. The commission arrived at Fort Larned (present-day Kansas) on October 11, where some chiefs were already present, including Black Kettle of the Cheyenne, Little Raven of the Arapaho, and Satanta of the Kiowa.Hoig 1980, p. 26. At the insistence of the tribes, the meetings were moved from Larned to Medicine Lodge River (near present day Medicine Lodge, Kansas), a traditional Indian ceremonial site. Preliminary discussions beginning on October 15 concluded that the Hancock expedition led earlier in 1867 by Maj. Gen. Winfield Scott Hancock, during which a large Cheyenne and Sioux village at Pawnee Fork had been destroyed, had been ill- conceived. This conclusion, and the commissioners' apology for the village's destruction, served to clear the air. It created a more positive atmosphere for the councils, which began in earnest on October 19.Hoig 1980, p. 29. Treaty terms and signatories The treaties negotiated at Medicine Lodge Creek were similar in their terms, involving surrender of traditional tribal territories in exchange for much smaller reservations in Indian Territory (present day Oklahoma) and allowances of food, clothing, equipment, and weapons and ammunition for hunting. = Treaties with the Kiowa, Comanche, and Plains Apache = Under the first of the three Medicine Lodge treaties, the Kiowa and Comanche were compelled to give up more than of traditional tribal territories in exchange for a reservation in the southwest corner of Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma), most of it lying between the North Fork of the Red River and the North Canadian River.Hoig 1980, p. 30. The tribes would also be provided houses, barns, and schools worth $30,000, which the tribes had not requested. By a second treaty, the Plains or Kiowa-Apache were incorporated into the first treaty;Hoig 1980, p. 31. this treaty was signed by all the Kiowa and Comanche signatories of the first treaty, along with several Plains Apache chiefs. The treaties with the Kiowa, Comanche, and Plains Apache tribes were concluded on October 21, 1867.

Under the Medicine Lodge Treaty, their assigned territory was cut to less than half of the 1865-treaty territory, reduced to that land south of the Kansas state line,Greene 2004, p. 37. for a total of of land. Additionally, the tribes were to be permitted to continue to hunt north of the Arkansas River for as long as the buffalo remained, as long as they stayed away from white settlements and roads. This concession was made to obtain participation of the Dog Soldiers to the treaty terms. A separate treaty version for the Northern Cheyenne was created, but they did not sign, as they were allied with Red Cloud and the Oglala Lakota in hostilities against the US. Southern Cheyenne chiefs signing * O-to-ah-nac-co, Bull Bear * Moke-tav-a-to, Black Kettle * Nac-co-hah-ket, Little Bear * Mo-a-vo-va-ast, Spotted Elk * Is-se-von-ne-ve, Buffalo Chief * Vip-po-nah, Slim Face * Wo-pah- ah, Gray Head * O-ni-hah-ket, Little Rock * Ma-mo-ki, or Curly Hair * O-to-ah- has-tis, Tall Bull * Wo-po-ham, or White Horse * Hah-ket-home-mah, Little Robe * Min-nin-ne-wah, Whirlwind * Mo-yan-histe-histow, Heap of Birds Arapaho chiefs signing * Little Raven * Yellow Bear * Storm * White Rabbit * Spotted Wolf * Little Big Mouth * Young Colt * Tall Bear  Unratified  The Treaty was immediately controversial and contested by both the members and other leaders of most of the involved tribal bands. Because most of the tribes were decentralized, acceptance of the treaty was contingent upon ratification by 3/4 of the adult males of each of the tribes. This condition was part of the treaty. The US never obtained sufficient votes for such ratification, and thus the treaty was never made valid or legal. Conflict over treaty terms continued for years. The Medicine Lodge Treaty required the approval of 3/4 of the adult males on the reservation for any further cessions of land. In 1887 the Congress changed national policy on allotment of Native American lands by passing the Dawes Act, which promoted allotment of parcels to individual households (they thought 160 acres per household would be adequate for cultivation) to break up the communal land held by tribes, with the government authorized to sell the resulting \\"surplus\\". In the case of the southern Plains Indians, a commission was assigned to gain their agreement to such allotments and sales. The Jerome Agreement of 1892, although never ratified by the tribes, implemented the new allotment policy, effectively removing millions of acres from the reservation. The commission negotiating the agreement had evaded telling the Indians what the sale price would be.Clark (1999), Lone Wolf, pp. 40‚Äì49 The Kiowa chief Lone Wolf sued the Secretary of the Interior on behalf of the entirety of the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache tribes, based on their being defrauded by the government at the time. The case, Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock, was ultimately decided by the US Supreme Court in 1903. In its ruling, the Court conceded that the Indians had not agreed to the land cessions. But, it concluded that the Congress had the \\"plenary power\\" to act unilaterally, so the circumstance did not matter. Its decision expressed the nineteenth-century attitude toward the Native Americans. Quoting from United States v. Kagama (1855) 118 U.S.375 in its ruling, the court reiterated the description of the Indian tribes as \\"wards of the nation... Dependent largely [on the United States] for their daily food... there arises the duty of protection, and with it the power.\\"Blue Clark, Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock: Treaty Rights and Indian Law at the End of the Nineteenth Century, University of Nebraska Press, 1999, p. 142 Aftermath Following the Supreme Court decision, the Congress continued to make unilateral changes to reservation lands without getting agreement by the tribes, beginning in 1903 and 1904 with the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota. The Commissioner of Indian Affairs, then William Arthur Jones, noted his intention to proceed without Native American consent.Clark (1999), Lone Wolf, p. 62 As the historian Blue Clark found, Jones wrote that he planned to report officially on land bills before Congress in favor \\"of Congress taking the property of Indians without their consent.\\" As another example, in 1907 Congress authorized the sale of \\"surplus\\" land at Rosebud, again without Indian consent.Clark (1999), Lone Wolf, pp. 82‚Äì83, accessed January 21, 2011 The outstanding issues were challenged again in the mid-twentieth century, beginning in 1948. Combined Kiowa, Apache and Comanche representatives filed suit against the US government for compensation due to the original treaty and subsequent actions, including sales under the unratified Jerome Agreement. Over the following decades and through several claims, the tribes won substantial compensation of tens of millions of dollars from the Indian Claims Commission.\\"The J. Roy Thompson Story: Dockets 32, 258, 257, 259-A and Appeal 12‚Äì71\\" , Special Collections & University Archives, Oklahoma State University Library, accessed January 21, 2011 The Medicine Lodge Treaty is dramatized in the 1962 episode, \\"The Truth Teller\\", on the syndicated television anthology series, Death Valley Days, hosted by Stanley Andrews. In the episode, Barney Phillips was cast as General Winfield Scott Hancock and Charles Carlson as Wild Bill Hickok, long after Guy Madison played Hickock in a weekly syndicated series.

Appearing also in his anthology Vacuum Diagrams, it represents a small, but integral part of the novel Ring. Plot summary Set primarily on Earth in the year A.D. 3951, Lieserl documents the title character's life from birth until shortly after her physical death. The story explains how the development of nanobots has enabled virtual immortality for humans by virtue of the nanotechnological manipulation of the chemical processes that cause cells to die. Lieserl's body is engineered by such nanobots but, instead of extending her life, the nanobots cause her to age rapidly. Memories and learning are also implanted into her cortex. The combination of these effects results in Lieserl living the equivalent of 90 year life in 90 days. Upon her physical death Lieserl's awareness is downloaded into a number of datastores, granting her a supreme consciousness. These datastores are placed within one mouth, or Interface, of a man-made wormhole which is then suspended within the Sun. The other Interface of the wormhole is left in orbit around the Sun and the pumping away of superheated gas from the Interface within the sun to the other Interface provides a refrigeration effect enabling the datastores holding Lieserl's consciousness to survive. Lieserl is told that her existence is just one of many projects initiated by mankind to ensure the survival of the species. Lieserl's task is to study the sun since it appears to be dying, aging more quickly than was to be expected without some exterior influence. The story ends just as Lieserl begins in her work without revealing the nature of the threat to the Sun. Nevertheless, the final passages of the story contain a foreshadowing of the dark future facing the universe when Phillida, Lieserl's mother, announces that mankind \\"can live as long as the stars - for tens of billions of years\\". The novel Ring and the short stories Secret History and The Baryonic Lords, also within the Vacuum Diagrams collection, tell of the premature aging of stars caused by a dark matter life-form named photino birds and, as a consequence, the end of baryonic life within the universe. Although the reason for Lieserl's task is an integral part of Stephen Baxter's Xeelee Sequence, the majority of the story is devoted to a study of the character, Lieserl, and the pain she suffers as a result of her accelerated existence. The daily loss of innocence prevents her from achieving minor victories against childhood rivals and causes additional frustrations by making the interesting projects of one day, such as exploring the history and mathematics of the game, snakes and ladders, seem trivial and childlike when she returns to them the day after. Her sexuality is explored, with her puberty passing in a moment and her hopes of romance being dashed as she outgrows a 15-year-old over the course of a single night. These negative experiences leave Lieserl feeling bitter towards her creators, but nevertheless imprint on her a humanity which ensures her long-term devotion to the project for which she was born and a strong desire to ensure the maintenance of the human race. Historical references The story includes a lengthy discussion of the history and mathematics behind the game of snakes and ladders. It has been speculated that the character, Lieserl, is named after Lieserl Einstein, the illegitimate daughter of Albert Einstein and Mileva Maric.

History She is a female Indian wolf, member of the Seeonee pack, who while suckling her own cubs decides also to adopt a human \\"cub\\" that her mate Rama has found wandering in the jungle, naming him \\"Mowgli\\" (which means \\"frog\\" in the Speech of the Jungle) because of his hairlessness. Defying the tiger Shere Khan, who is determined to eat the man- cub, she reveals that her name is Raksha (\\"protection/nurture\\") because of her ferocity as a fighter, and she will fight to the death for any of her cubs, natural or adopted. Raksha does not play a large role in the Mowgli stories, but occasionally offers her adopted son moral support. Disney * Raksha appears briefly at the beginning of Disney's The Jungle Book. Bagheera discovers young Mowgli in the jungle, and takes him to Raksha, who has just had cubs. She raises him along with her own cubs and 10 years later Mowgli is well acquainted with jungle life. * Raksha also appears in The Jungle Book: Mowgli's Story, voiced by Peri Gilpin. This version is the mate of Akela. She is later killed by Shere Khan when she goes to help rescue Mowgli from the Bandar-log. * Raksha appears in Disney's 2016 live-action adaption where she is voiced by Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o. In an interview regarding her character, Nyong'o described Raksha as deeply caring for her pups, including Mowgli, whom she adopts as her own, and refers to her as a protector. In the film, Raksha raises Mowgli as her son under the sanctuary of Akela along with her own pups, including Grey Brother, and defends him from Shere Khan when he comes to the watering hole during the drought. However, the tiger's threats towards Mowgli and the pack cause debate on whether or not Mowgli should leave. Mowgli decides to leave with Bagheera to keep the Seeonee pack safe from harm. Though she is reluctant to give Mowgli up, she lets him leave, stating that Mowgli will always be her son. When Shere Khan returns and demands Mowgli be turned over to him only to find he has left, Shere Khan kills Akela and takes control of the pack, hoping it will lure him back. Upon her asking why Shere Khan has done this after Shere Khan telling the cubs a story about the cuckoo, he answers that he wants Mowgli dead as opposed to him simply leaving. When Mowgli returns to face Shere Khan with fire, she along with the rest of the pack are frightened of him as he has accidentally set the jungle ablaze. When he casts the fire away, Raksha rallies the wolves and is joined by Bagheera and Baloo in battling against Shere Khan so Mowgli has enough time to set a trap for the tiger and kill him. After the fire is put out by Mowgli and the elephants, Raksha and the other creatures of the jungle praise Mowgli. Sometime afterwards, Raksha is now the leader of the Seeonee pack, and has gleefully accepted Mowgli back into her family. In other media * In the anime Jungle Book Shonen Mowgli, Raksha appears like in the book, except she is renamed Luri, has a more important role in the storyline, and becomes the eventual leader of the wolf pack. She is voiced by Mari Yokoo in the Japanese and Kathleen Fee in the English Dub. * Raksha also appears in the computer animated series The Jungle Book, voiced by Prudence Alcott. She is depicted as a white wolf. * Raksha is renamed to Nisha in Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle where the character is voiced by Naomie Harris.

Nasi lemak is a Malay cuisine dish consisting of fragrant rice cooked in coconut milk and pandan leaf. It is commonly found in Malaysia, where it is considered the national dish; it is also the native dish in neighbouring areas with significant Malay populations such as Singapore; Brunei, and Southern Thailand. In Indonesia it can be found in several parts of Sumatra; especially Malay realm of Riau, Riau Islands and Medan. Nasi lemak can also be found in the Bangsamoro region of Mindanao prepared by Filipino Moro. It is considered one of the most famous dishes for a Malay-style breakfast. It is not to be confused with nasi dagang, sold in the Malaysian east coast states of Terengganu and Kelantan (and its kindred region in Pattani, Yala and Narathiwat in Thailand and Natuna in Indonesia), although both dishes are often served for breakfast. However, because nasi lemak can be served in a variety of ways, it is often eaten throughout the day. History Nasi lemak was mentioned in a book \\"The Circumstances of Malay Life\\", written by Sir Richard Olof Winstedt in 1909. With roots in Malay culture and Malay cuisine, its name in Malay literally means \\"oily or fatty rice\\", but is taken in this context to mean \\"rich\\" or \\"creamy\\". The name is derived from the cooking process whereby rice is soaked in coconut cream and then the mixture steamed. The rice is normally cooked with pandan leaves that gives it a distinctive flavour. Traditionally, nasi lemak is served with a hot spicy sauce (sambal), and usually includes various garnishes, including fresh cucumber slices, small fried anchovies (ikan bilis), roasted peanuts, and hard-boiled or fried egg. As a more substantial meal, nasi lemak may also be served with an additional protein dish such as ayam goreng (fried chicken), sambal sotong (cuttlefish in chili), small fried fish, cockles, and on special occasions rendang daging (beef stewed in coconut milk and spices). Other accompaniments include stir fried water convolvulus (kangkong), and spicy pickled vegetables salad acar. Traditionally most of these accompaniments are spicy in nature. Nasi lemak is widely eaten in Malaysia and Singapore. More commonly consumed as breakfast in both countries, it is commonly sold at hawker food centres and roadside stalls in Malaysia and Singapore. In Indonesia, nasi lemak is a favourite local breakfast fare; especially in Eastern Sumatra (Riau Islands, Riau and Jambi provinces). In Palembang, it is also a favourite local dish with the name \\"nasi gemuk\\". In Palembang Malay, \\"gemuk\\" has the same meaning as \\"lemak\\". This unique dish often comes wrapped in banana leaves, newspaper or brown paper, or in some shops is served on a plate. However, owing to its popularity there are restaurants which serve it as a noon or evening meal, making it possible for the dish to be eaten all day. Nasi lemak kukus which means \\"steamed nasi lemak\\" is another name given to nasi lemak served with steamed rice. In Malaysia, nasi lemak can also be found in a pasar malam (night market) with a variety of dishes. On 31 January 2019, Google released a Google Doodle celebrating nasi lemak. Variations Nasi ayam, an alternative of nasi lemak in some places. In Malaysia and Singapore, nasi lemak comes in many variations as they are prepared by different chefs from different cultures. The original nasi lemak in Malaysia is arguably a typical Southern and Central Peninsular Malaysia breakfast, and is considered of Malay origin. However, due to the popularity of the dish, it is regarded as a national dish. The rice cooked in coconut milk is actually common in Southeast Asia. This is the same process used to make similar rice dishes from their neighbouring country Indonesia, which are nasi uduk from Jakarta, nasi gurih from Aceh and Javanese nasi liwet. However, there are differences in taste because knotted leaves of Pandan screwpine are steamed with the rice to impart flavour and fragrance. Less often other spices such as ginger and occasionally herbs like lemon grass may be added for additional fragrance. Nasi lemak in the Northern West Peninsular tends to include curry. The sambal tends to range from fiery hot to mildly hot with a sweet under taste. Nasi lemak is not as popular as the indigenous nasi berlauk, nasi dagang, and nasi kerabu in North East Peninsular Malaysia. It is regarded as a speciality imported dish in Sabah and Sarawak. Hotels often feature nasi lemak on their menu with elaborate dishes, such as beef rendang and the addition of other seafood. Hawker centres in Singapore and Malaysia usually wrap them in banana leaves to enhance the flavour. Roadside stalls sell them ready packed, known as \\"nasi lemak bungkus\\", with minimal additions that cost between RM 1.50 ‚Äì 6.00 per pack. Seafood outlets often serve the basic nasi lemak to accompany barbecued seafood. There are Malaysian Chinese and Malaysian Indian versions, and Singaporean Malay and Singaporean Chinese versions. Some people suggest that sambal is the most important part of a nasi lemak meal. If not prepared properly, it could ruin the dish, since Malaysians love food that is hot and spicy. A good deal of spirited and good-natured debate exists around this point. =Traditional Malaysian version= Nasi lemak with fried chicken and egg This traditional favourite offers sambal, ikan bilis (anchovies), peanuts and boiled egg. This is the most traditional version. Nasi lemak stalls can be found serving them with fried egg, sambal kerang (cockles) - a local favourite, sambal squids, sambal fish, chicken or chicken/beef rendang, squid fritters or even fried chicken or fish. It can be consumed for breakfast, brunch, lunch, tea, dinner and even supper. The special part about it is the rice. The rice can be cooked with fresh coconut milk, and sometimes with pandanus leaf (screwpine) thrown in. The rice is served on banana leaves, so it smells naturally fragrant when eaten. This traditional serving style has been inherited for many generations‚Äîfrom a little stall at road side to commercials, it seems like a simple way fulfill the crave towards this traditional food in cities. =Malaysian Indian variation= The Malaysian Indian variation is similar to the original version. However, many Malaysian Indians are Hindus, and thus do not eat beef. Nasi lemak in the Malaysian Indian version is served with curry, such as chicken curry, fish curry or lamb curry. Moreover, Malaysian Indians also serve a rendition of the dish alongside their very own version of Rendang. =Malaysian Chinese variation= Although it is not common to see Malaysian Chinese stalls and restaurants selling nasi lemak, there is a non- halal version that contains pork, sold in towns and cities such as Malacca and certain parts of Kuala Lumpur. Some Malaysian Chinese hawkers are known to make minced pork sambal. =Indonesian Riau variation= Stamp showing Nasi lemak from Riau, Indonesia. Right across the Malacca Strait, the Malay Indonesians of Sumatran east coast shares close kinship and common Malay cuisine heritage with their Malaysian counterpart. As the result, nasi lemak is also native cuisine to Riau Island and Riau province. In archipelagic region like Riau Islands province of Indonesia, usually seafood are used to accompany nasi lemak, such as ikan bilis (anchovy), ikan tamban (Sardinella longiceps), ikan selar kuning (Selaroides leptolepis), sotong or cumi-cumi (squid) or small prawns. The Riau islands traditional nasi lemak is quite similar to Malaysian version; it comes as a platter of coconut rice wrapped in banana leaf, with cucumber slices, small dried anchovies (ikan bilis), roasted peanuts, hard boiled egg, and hot spicy sauce (sambal). The Riau islands version however, comes with an addition of small fish locally known as ikan tamban, usually fried with sambal chili paste and very crispy, the whole fish is edible. Prawns and squids are also commonly stir-fried in chili paste as sambal udang or sambal cumi. In Indonesia, nasi lemak is often sprinkled with bawang goreng (crispy fried shallot granules). Nasi lemak with sambal cumi (chili squid), served in Indonesia. In Riau Islands and Riau provinces it is often served with spicy freshwater fish or seafoods (fish, shrimp or squid). In Pekanbaru city in Sumatran province of Riau however, freshwater river fishes are commonly used as lauk to accompany nasi lemak. The freshwater fishes includes ikan selais (Kryptopterus cryptopterus) and ikan patin (Pangasius). Other fish such as ikan lomek (Harpadon nehereus) is also commonly used. These fishes are usually cooked in Minang style lado ijo (green chili pepper), minced and fried as perkedel ikan, or just plainly fried. =Indonesian Medan variation= Nasi lemak Medan with beef rendang. Medan Melayu Deli nasi lemak version usually served with choice of side dishes either rendang (beef or chicken) or balado (egg or shrimp in chili sauce). A set of complete Medan's nasi lemak includes a sprinkle of crispy fried shallot, slices of omelette, kripik kentang balado (spicy potato chips), tempe orek (seasoned fried tempeh), perkedel (fried potato patties), sambal chili paste, slices of cucumber, and slightly bitter emping cracker. Some traditional restaurant chains have dedicated their business to serving nasi lemak Medan. Next to rendang and balado, the vegetable dish sayur masak lemak (vegetables including long beans, cabbage, and long green chilies in coconut milk) is also offered. It is a popular street food in Medan sold in humble tarp tents warung, and usually sold together with Lontong Medan. Since Medan is located near the Aceh border, and there are numbers of Aceh people that reside in the city, the term nasi lemak and nasi gurih are often used interchangeably in the city, since the terms refer to a similar coconut rice dish. =Singaporean Malay variation= Nasi lemak in Singapore served with chicken cutlet, sambal chilli with anchovy, peanuts and salted anchovy, egg and Otak-otak. For most of the Singaporean Malay variation, the sambal of the nasi lemak has more of a sweeter and less spicy taste when compared to other variations. As the sambal is a crucial portion of the nasi lemak, it is preferred to be less spicy so as not to overpower the taste of the coconut based rice and the other ingredients. The sides to this dish includes ikan bilis (anchovies), peanuts and an omelette or fried egg, which is rather similar to the Malaysian version, although the use of a boiled egg as with the Malaysian version is somewhat less common. Occasionally, a variant using the long grain basmati rice may also be found. =Singaporean Chinese variation= Retaining the familiar aroma of pandan leaves, the Singaporean Chinese variation comes with a variety of sides that includes deep fried drumstick, chicken franks, fish cake, curried vegetables and tongsan luncheon meat. There is also the traditional way of serving it with just the ikan bilis (anchovies), peanuts and fried egg similar to the Malaysian version. Sometimes the rice is also coloured emerald green with the use of screwpine leaf extract or essence, commonly called pandan leaves, that perfumes the rice with a nice fragrance when added to the rice with the coconut milk as well as giving it its bright green colour. The use of the colour may have arisen as a gimmick to entice customers. =Vegetarian variation= In certain parts of Malaysia, hawkers also offer vegetarian nasi lemak in which the dried anchovies are substituted with vegetarian mock anchovies. =Thai variation= In the Southern Thailand town of Betong, the nasi lemak is served with tom yam sauce. Health In March 2016, nasi lemak was mentioned as one of the 10 healthy international breakfast foods by TIME magazine. However, this opinion may be misleading as the writer might have been referring to the dish's \\"healthier\\" and smaller version, and comparing it to the larger American breakfast (fried bacon, eggs, pancakes/hash browns). A single, full size serving of nasi lemak with additional fried chicken, meat or fish, can be between 800 and well over 1,000 calories. The savoury coconut milk-infused rice also contains saturated fat, an ingredient connected to health problems, including diabetes.

Director John Boorman is credited with creating the first Oscar screeners to promote his film The Emerald Forest in 1985. Overview Screeners help critics and awards voters see smaller movies that do not have the marketing advantage or distribution of major studio releases. Positive mentions can result in awards consideration. A screener often has no post-processing. Nowadays, physical DVD copies still appear to be issued, but screeners are also distributed digitally to members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and the media/publicity sites of individual television networks for television shows. When screeners leak online, they are often tagged \\"DVDSCR\\", and often have an on-screen graphic watermarked with the receiver's name or email address. Another anti- piracy measure includes the encryption of DVD disks so that they will only play in machines given exclusively to voters. History According to the Los Angeles Times, Oscar screeners originated with the efforts of director John Boorman to promote his film The Emerald Forest, a 1985 Powers Boothe vehicle about an American child kidnapped by a tribe in the Amazon Rainforest. The film had been lauded by critics, but due to the business troubles of its distributor, Embassy Pictures, received no advertising campaign. Boorman paid for VHS copies of the film to be made available to Academy members for no charge at certain Los Angeles video rental stores. Despite the novelty of his campaign, however, Emerald Forest received no Oscar nominations. In 2003, the MPAA announced that they would be ceasing distribution of screeners to Academy members, citing fears of copyright infringement. A group of independent film makers sued and won a decision against the MPAA. The MPAA later reinstated the screeners with the implementation of a new policy requiring recipients to sign a binding contract that they would not share the screeners with others. In January 2004, Academy member Carmine Caridi was announced as a person of interest in an ongoing FBI investigation into video piracy. He was subsequently expelled from the Academy, after he was found to have sent as many as 60 screeners a year for at least three years to a contact called Russell Sprague in Illinois. Caridi was later ordered to pay Warner Bros. for copyright infringement of two of their films, Mystic River and The Last Samurai, a total of $300,000 ($150,000 per title). In March 2016, TorrentFreak reported that original screener DVDs appear in dozens of eBay listings. According to eBay seller NoHo Trader, the sale of Emmy screener DVDs is lawful, although studios occasionally still take down Emmy DVD auctions and other lawful promotional materials. The Television Academy indicates the limited license governing the use of these screeners prohibits further distribution. In 2019, the Academy introduced a private video on demand platform known as the \\"Academy Screening Room\\", accessible online and via an Apple TV app, which allows distributors to host screeners online for a fee. Screeners and other physical items sent to voters will be discontinued entirely beginning at the 94th (2022) Academy Awards, switching exclusively to using the Academy Screening Room.

Activated is sometimes substituted with active. Due to its high degree of microporosity, one gram of activated carbon has a surface area in excess of as determined by gas adsorption. An activation level sufficient for useful application may be obtained solely from high surface area. Further chemical treatment often enhances adsorption properties. Activated carbon is usually derived from charcoal. When derived from coal it is referred to as activated coal. Activated coke is derived from coke. Uses Activated carbon is used in methane and hydrogen storage, air purification, solvent recovery, decaffeination, gold purification, metal extraction, water purification, medicine, sewage treatment, air filters in respirators, filters in compressed air, teeth whitening, production of hydrogen chloride and many other applications. =Industrial application= One major industrial application involves use of activated carbon in metal finishing for purification of electroplating solutions. For example, it is the main purification technique for removing organic impurities from bright nickel plating solutions. A variety of organic chemicals are added to plating solutions for improving their deposit qualities and for enhancing properties like brightness, smoothness, ductility, etc. Due to passage of direct current and electrolytic reactions of anodic oxidation and cathodic reduction, organic additives generate unwanted breakdown products in solution. Their excessive build up can adversely affect plating quality and physical properties of deposited metal. Activated carbon treatment removes such impurities and restores plating performance to the desired level. =Medical uses= Activated charcoal for medical use Activated carbon is used to treat poisonings and overdoses following oral ingestion. Tablets or capsules of activated carbon are used in many countries as an over-the-counter drug to treat diarrhea, indigestion, and flatulence. However, activated charcoal shows no effect on intestinal gas and diarrhea, and is, ordinarily, medically ineffective if poisoning resulted from ingestion of corrosive agents, boric acid, petroleum products, and is particularly ineffective against poisonings of strong acids or alkali, cyanide, iron, lithium, arsenic, methanol, ethanol or ethylene glycol. Activated carbon will not prevent these chemicals from being absorbed into the human body. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. Incorrect application (e.g. into the lungs) results in pulmonary aspiration, which can sometimes be fatal if immediate medical treatment is not initiated. =Analytical chemistry applications= Activated carbon, in 50% w/w combination with celite, is used as stationary phase in low-pressure chromatographic separation of carbohydrates (mono-, di-, tri-saccharides) using ethanol solutions (5‚Äì50%) as mobile phase in analytical or preparative protocols. Activated carbon is useful for extracting the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) such as dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban and edoxaban from blood plasma samples. For this purpose it has been made into \\"minitablets\\", each containing 5 mg activated carbon for treating 1ml samples of DOAC. Since this activated carbon has no effect on blood clotting factors, heparin or most other anticoagulants this allows a plasma sample to be analyzed for abnormalities otherwise affected by the DOACs. =Environmental applications= Activated carbon is usually used in water filtration systems. In this illustration, the activated carbon is in the fourth level (counted from bottom). Carbon adsorption has numerous applications in removing pollutants from air or water streams both in the field and in industrial processes such as: * Spill cleanup * Groundwater remediation * Drinking water filtration * Air purification * Volatile organic compounds capture from painting, dry cleaning, gasoline dispensing operations, and other processes * Volatile organic compounds recovery (solvent recovery systems, SRU) from flexible packaging, converting, coating, and other processes. During early implementation of the 1974 Safe Drinking Water Act in the US, EPA officials developed a rule that proposed requiring drinking water treatment systems to use granular activated carbon. Because of its high cost, the so-called GAC rule encountered strong opposition across the country from the water supply industry, including the largest water utilities in California. Hence, the agency set aside the rule.EPA Alumni Association: Senior EPA officials discuss early implementation of the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, Video, Transcript (see pages 15-16). Activated carbon filtration is an effective water treatment method due to its multi-functional nature. There are specific types of activated carbon filtration methods and equipment that are indicated ‚Äì depending upon the contaminants involved. Activated carbon is also used for the measurement of radon concentration in air. =Agriculture uses= Activated carbon (charcoal) is an allowed substance used by organic farmers in both livestock production and wine making. In livestock production it is used as a pesticide, animal feed additive, processing aid, nonagricultural ingredient and disinfectant.Activated Charcoal Review Sheet, USDA Organic Materials Review, February 2002. In organic winemaking, activated carbon is allowed for use as a processing agent to adsorb brown color pigments from white grape concentrates.Activated Carbon Petition, USDA Organic Materials Review petition, Canadaigua Wine, May 2002. It is sometimes used as biochar. =Distilled alcoholic beverage purification= Activated carbon filters (AC filters) can be used to filter vodka and whiskey of organic impurities which can affect color, taste, and odor. Passing an organically impure vodka through an activated carbon filter at the proper flow rate will result in vodka with an identical alcohol content and significantly increased organic purity, as judged by odor and taste. =Fuel storage= Research is being done testing various activated carbons' ability to store natural gas and hydrogen gas. The porous material acts like a sponge for different types of gases. The gas is attracted to the carbon material via Van der Waals forces. Some carbons have been able to achieve bonding energies of 5‚Äì10 kJ per mol. The gas may then be desorbed when subjected to higher temperatures and either combusted to do work or in the case of hydrogen gas extracted for use in a hydrogen fuel cell. Gas storage in activated carbons is an appealing gas storage method because the gas can be stored in a low pressure, low mass, low volume environment that would be much more feasible than bulky on-board pressure tanks in vehicles. The United States Department of Energy has specified certain goals to be achieved in the area of research and development of nano-porous carbon materials. All of the goals are yet to be satisfied but numerous institutions, including the ALL-CRAFT program, are continuing to conduct work in this promising field. =Gas purification= Filters with activated carbon are usually used in compressed air and gas purification to remove oil vapors, odor, and other hydrocarbons from the air. The most common designs use a 1-stage or 2 stage filtration principle in which activated carbon is embedded inside the filter media. Activated carbon filters are used to retain radioactive gases within the air vacuumed from a nuclear boiling water reactor turbine condenser. The large charcoal beds adsorb these gases and retain them while they rapidly decay to non-radioactive solid species. The solids are trapped in the charcoal particles, while the filtered air passes through. =Chemical purification= Activated carbon is commonly used on the laboratory scale to purify solutions of organic molecules containing unwanted colored organic impurities. Filtration over activated carbon is used in large scale fine chemical and pharmaceutical processes for the same purpose. The carbon is either mixed with the solution then filtered off or immobilized in a filter. =Mercury scrubbing= Activated carbon, often infused with sulfur or iodine, is widely used to trap mercury emissions from coal-fired power stations, medical incinerators, and from natural gas at the wellhead. This carbon is a special product costing more than US$4.00 per kg. Since it is often not recycled, the mercury-laden activated carbon presents a disposal dilemma.Tim Flannery, Here On Earth: A New Beginning, Allen Lane (2011), p. 186. If the activated carbon contains less than 260 ppm mercury, United States federal regulations allow it to be stabilized (for example, trapped in concrete) for landfilling. However, waste containing greater than 260 ppm is considered to be in the high-mercury subcategory and is banned from landfilling (Land-Ban Rule). This material is now accumulating in warehouses and in deep abandoned mines at an estimated rate of 100 tons per year. The problem of disposal of mercury-laden activated carbon is not unique to the United States. In the Netherlands, this mercury is largely recovered and the activated carbon is disposed of by complete burning, forming carbon dioxide (CO2). Production Activated carbon is carbon produced from carbonaceous source materials such as bamboo, coconut husk, willow peat, wood, coir, lignite, coal, and petroleum pitch. It can be produced by one of the following processes: # Physical activation: The source material is developed into activated carbon using hot gases. Air is then introduced to burn out the gasses, creating a graded, screened and de-dusted form of activated carbon. This is generally done by using one or more of the following processes: #* Carbonization: Material with carbon content is pyrolyzed at temperatures in the range 600‚Äì900 ¬∞C, usually in an inert atmosphere with gases like argon or nitrogen #* Activation/Oxidation: Raw material or carbonized material is exposed to oxidizing atmospheres (oxygen or steam) at temperatures above 250 ¬∞C, usually in the temperature range of 600‚Äì1200 ¬∞C. # Chemical activation: The carbon material is impregnated with certain chemicals. The chemical is typically an acid, strong base, or a salt (phosphoric acid 25%, potassium hydroxide 5%, sodium hydroxide 5%, calcium chloride 25%, and zinc chloride 25% ). The carbon is then subjected to lower temperatures (250‚Äì600 ¬∞C). It is believed that the temperature activates the carbon at this stage by forcing the material to open up and have more microscopic pores. Chemical activation is preferred to physical activation owing to the lower temperatures, better quality consistency, and shorter time needed for activating the material. Classification Activated carbons are complex products which are difficult to classify on the basis of their behaviour, surface characteristics and other fundamental criteria. However, some broad classification is made for general purposes based on their size, preparation methods, and industrial applications. =Powdered activated carbon = A micrograph of activated charcoal (R 1) under bright field illumination on a light microscope. Notice the fractal-like shape of the particles hinting at their enormous surface area. Each particle in this image, despite being only around 0.1 mm across, can have a surface area of several square centimeters. The entire image covers a region of approximately 1.1 by 0.7 mm, and the full resolution version is at a scale of 6.236 pixels/Œºm. Normally, activated carbons (R 1) are made in particulate form as powders or fine granules less than 1.0 mm in size with an average diameter between 0.15 and 0.25 mm. Thus they present a large surface to volume ratio with a small diffusion distance. Activated carbon (R 1) is defined as the activated carbon particles retained on a 50-mesh sieve (0.297 mm). PAC material is finer material. PAC is made up of crushed or ground carbon particles, 95‚Äì100% of which will pass through a designated mesh sieve. The ASTM classifies particles passing through an 80-mesh sieve (0.177 mm) and smaller as PAC. It is not common to use PAC in a dedicated vessel, due to the high head loss that would occur. Instead, PAC is generally added directly to other process units, such as raw water intakes, rapid mix basins, clarifiers, and gravity filters. =Granular activated carbon= A micrograph of activated charcoal (GAC) under scanning electron microscope Granular activated carbon (GAC) has a relatively larger particle size compared to powdered activated carbon and consequently, presents a smaller external surface. Diffusion of the adsorbate is thus an important factor. These carbons are suitable for adsorption of gases and vapors, because they diffuse rapidly. Granulated carbons are used for water treatment, deodorization and separation of components of flow system and are also used in rapid mix basins. GAC can be either in granular or extruded form. GAC is designated by sizes such as 8√ó20, 20√ó40, or 8√ó30 for liquid phase applications and 4√ó6, 4√ó8 or 4√ó10 for vapor phase applications. A 20√ó40 carbon is made of particles that will pass through a U.S. Standard Mesh Size No. 20 sieve (0.84 mm) (generally specified as 85% passing) but be retained on a U.S. Standard Mesh Size No. 40 sieve (0.42 mm) (generally specified as 95% retained). AWWA (1992) B604 uses the 50-mesh sieve (0.297 mm) as the minimum GAC size. The most popular aqueous phase carbons are the 12√ó40 and 8√ó30 sizes because they have a good balance of size, surface area, and head loss characteristics. =Extruded activated carbon (EAC)= Extruded activated carbon (EAC) combines powdered activated carbon with a binder, which are fused together and extruded into a cylindrical shaped activated carbon block with diameters from 0.8 to 130 mm. These are mainly used for gas phase applications because of their low pressure drop, high mechanical strength and low dust content. Also sold as CTO filter (Chlorine, Taste, Odor). =Bead activated carbon (BAC)= Bead activated carbon (BAC) is made from petroleum pitch and supplied in diameters from approximately 0.35 to 0.80 mm. Similar to EAC, it is also noted for its low pressure drop, high mechanical strength and low dust content, but with a smaller grain size. Its spherical shape makes it preferred for fluidized bed applications such as water filtration. =Impregnated carbon= Porous carbons containing several types of inorganic impregnate such as iodine, silver, cations such as Al, Mn, Zn, Fe, Li, Ca have also been prepared for specific application in air pollution control especially in museums and galleries. Due to its antimicrobial and antiseptic properties, silver loaded activated carbon is used as an adsorbent for purification of domestic water. Drinking water can be obtained from natural water by treating the natural water with a mixture of activated carbon and Al(OH)3, a flocculating agent. Impregnated carbons are also used for the adsorption of Hydrogen Sulfide(H2S) and thiols. Adsorption rates for H2S as high as 50% by weight have been reported. =Polymer coated carbon= This is a process by which a porous carbon can be coated with a biocompatible polymer to give a smooth and permeable coat without blocking the pores. The resulting carbon is useful for hemoperfusion. Hemoperfusion is a treatment technique in which large volumes of the patient's blood are passed over an adsorbent substance in order to remove toxic substances from the blood. Woven activated carbon cloth =Woven carbon= There is a technology of processing technical rayon fiber into activated carbon cloth for carbon filtering. Adsorption capacity of activated cloth is greater than that of activated charcoal (BET theory) surface area: 500‚Äì1500 m2/g, pore volume: 0.3‚Äì0.8 cm3/g). Thanks to the different forms of activated material, it can be used in a wide range of applications (supercapacitors, odour-absorbers, CBRN- defense industry etc.). Properties A gram of activated carbon can have a surface area in excess of , with being readily achievable. Carbon aerogels, while more expensive, have even higher surface areas, and are used in special applications. Under an electron microscope, the high surface-area structures of activated carbon are revealed. Individual particles are intensely convoluted and display various kinds of porosity; there may be many areas where flat surfaces of graphite-like material run parallel to each other, separated by only a few nanometers or so. These micropores provide superb conditions for adsorption to occur, since adsorbing material can interact with many surfaces simultaneously. Tests of adsorption behaviour are usually done with nitrogen gas at 77 K under high vacuum, but in everyday terms activated carbon is perfectly capable of producing the equivalent, by adsorption from its environment, liquid water from steam at and a pressure of 1/10,000 of an atmosphere. James Dewar, the scientist after whom the Dewar (vacuum flask) is named, spent much time studying activated carbon and published a paper regarding its adsorption capacity with regard to gases.The separation of the most volatile gases from air without liquefaction In this paper, he discovered that cooling the carbon to liquid nitrogen temperatures allowed it to adsorb significant quantities of numerous air gases, among others, that could then be recollected by simply allowing the carbon to warm again and that coconut based carbon was superior for the effect. He uses oxygen as an example, wherein the activated carbon would typically adsorb the atmospheric concentration (21%) under standard conditions, but release over 80% oxygen if the carbon was first cooled to low temperatures. Physically, activated carbon binds materials by van der Waals force or London dispersion force. Activated carbon does not bind well to certain chemicals, including alcohols, diols, strong acids and bases, metals and most inorganics, such as lithium, sodium, iron, lead, arsenic, fluorine, and boric acid. Activated carbon adsorbs iodine very well. The iodine capacity, mg/g, (ASTM D28 Standard Method test) may be used as an indication of total surface area. Carbon monoxide is not well adsorbed by activated carbon. This should be of particular concern to those using the material in filters for respirators, fume hoods or other gas control systems as the gas is undetectable to the human senses, toxic to metabolism and neurotoxic. Substantial lists of the common industrial and agricultural gases adsorbed by activated carbon can be found online. Activated carbon can be used as a substrate for the application of various chemicals to improve the adsorptive capacity for some inorganic (and problematic organic) compounds such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S), ammonia (NH3), formaldehyde (HCOH), mercury (Hg) and radioactive iodine-131(131I). This property is known as chemisorption. =Iodine number= Many carbons preferentially adsorb small molecules. Iodine number is the most fundamental parameter used to characterize activated carbon performance. It is a measure of activity level (higher number indicates higher degree of activation) often reported in mg/g (typical range 500‚Äì1200 mg/g). It is a measure of the micropore content of the activated carbon (0 to 20 √Ö, or up to 2 nm) by adsorption of iodine from solution. It is equivalent to surface area of carbon between 900 and 1100 m2/g. It is the standard measure for liquid-phase applications. Iodine number is defined as the milligrams of iodine adsorbed by one gram of carbon when the iodine concentration in the residual filtrate is at a concentration of 0.02 normal (i.e. 0.02N). Basically, iodine number is a measure of the iodine adsorbed in the pores and, as such, is an indication of the pore volume available in the activated carbon of interest. Typically, water-treatment carbons have iodine numbers ranging from 600 to 1100. Frequently, this parameter is used to determine the degree of exhaustion of a carbon in use. However, this practice should be viewed with caution, as chemical interactions with the adsorbate may affect the iodine uptake, giving false results. Thus, the use of iodine number as a measure of the degree of exhaustion of a carbon bed can only be recommended if it has been shown to be free of chemical interactions with adsorbates and if an experimental correlation between iodine number and the degree of exhaustion has been determined for the particular application. =Molasses= Some carbons are more adept at adsorbing large molecules. Molasses number or molasses efficiency is a measure of the mesopore content of the activated carbon (greater than 20 √Ö, or larger than 2 nm) by adsorption of molasses from solution. A high molasses number indicates a high adsorption of big molecules (range 95‚Äì600). Caramel dp (decolorizing performance) is similar to molasses number. Molasses efficiency is reported as a percentage (range 40%‚Äì185%) and parallels molasses number (600 = 185%, 425 = 85%). The European molasses number (range 525‚Äì110) is inversely related to the North American molasses number. Molasses Number is a measure of the degree of decolorization of a standard molasses solution that has been diluted and standardized against standardized activated carbon. Due to the size of color bodies, the molasses number represents the potential pore volume available for larger adsorbing species. As all of the pore volume may not be available for adsorption in a particular waste water application, and as some of the adsorbate may enter smaller pores, it is not a good measure of the worth of a particular activated carbon for a specific application. Frequently, this parameter is useful in evaluating a series of active carbons for their rates of adsorption. Given two active carbons with similar pore volumes for adsorption, the one having the higher molasses number will usually have larger feeder pores resulting in more efficient transfer of adsorbate into the adsorption space. =Tannin= Tannins are a mixture of large and medium size molecules. Carbons with a combination of macropores and mesopores adsorb tannins. The ability of a carbon to adsorb tannins is reported in parts per million concentration (range 200 ppm‚Äì362 ppm). =Methylene blue= Some carbons have a mesopore (20 √Ö to 50 √Ö, or 2 to 5 nm) structure which adsorbs medium size molecules, such as the dye methylene blue. Methylene blue adsorption is reported in g/100g (range 11‚Äì28 g/100g). =Dechlorination= Some carbons are evaluated based on the dechlorination half-life length, which measures the chlorine-removal efficiency of activated carbon. The dechlorination half-value length is the depth of carbon required to reduce the chlorine level of a flowing stream from 5 ppm to 3.5 ppm. A lower half-value length indicates superior performance. =Apparent density= The solid or skeletal density of activated carbons will typically range between 2000 and 2100 kg/m3 (125‚Äì130 lbs./cubic foot). However, a large part of an activated carbon sample will consist of air space between particles, and the actual or apparent density will therefore be lower, typically 400 to 500 kg/m3 (25‚Äì31 lbs./cubic foot).TIGG Corporation. Granular activated carbon selection . Published 2012-05-8, retrieved 2012-09-21. Higher density provides greater volume activity and normally indicates better-quality activated carbon. ASTM D 2854 -09 (2014) is used to determine the apparent density of activated carbon. =Hardness/abrasion number= It is a measure of the activated carbon's resistance to attrition. It is an important indicator of activated carbon to maintain its physical integrity and withstand frictional forces. There are large differences in the hardness of activated carbons, depending on the raw material and activity levels. =Ash content= Ash reduces the overall activity of activated carbon and reduces the efficiency of reactivation: the amount is exclusively dependent on the base raw material used to produce the activated carbon (e.g. coconut, wood, coal, etc.). The metal oxides (Fe2O3) can leach out of activated carbon resulting in discoloration. Acid/water- soluble ash content is more significant than total ash content. Soluble ash content can be very important for aquarists, as ferric oxide can promote algal growths. A carbon with a low soluble ash content should be used for marine, freshwater fish and reef tanks to avoid heavy metal poisoning and excess plant/algal growth. ASTM (D2866 Standard Method test) is used to determine the ash content of activated carbon. =Carbon tetrachloride activity= Measurement of the porosity of an activated carbon by the adsorption of saturated carbon tetrachloride vapour. =Particle size distribution= The finer the particle size of an activated carbon, the better the access to the surface area and the faster the rate of adsorption kinetics. In vapour phase systems this needs to be considered against pressure drop, which will affect energy cost. Careful consideration of particle size distribution can provide significant operating benefits. However, in the case of using activated carbon for adsorption of minerals such as gold, the particle size should be in the range of . Activated carbon with particle size less than 1 mm would not be suitable for elution (the stripping of mineral from an activated carbon). Modification of properties and reactivity Acid-base, oxidation-reduction and specific adsorption characteristics are strongly dependent on the composition of the surface functional groups.Philippe Serp, Jos√© Luis Figueiredo, Carbon Materials for Catalysis, Wiley, ‚Äì 2009, ‚Äì 550 p. The surface of conventional activated carbon is reactive, capable of oxidation by atmospheric oxygen and oxygen plasma steam, and also carbon dioxide and ozone. Oxidation in the liquid phase is caused by a wide range of reagents (HNO3, H2O2, KMnO4). Through the formation of a large number of basic and acidic groups on the surface of oxidized carbon to sorption and other properties can differ significantly from the unmodified forms. Activated carbon can be nitrogenated by natural products or polymers or processing of carbon with nitrogenating reagents. Activated carbon can interact with chlorine, bromine and fluorine. Surface of activated carbon, like other carbon materials can be fluoralkylated by treatment with (per)fluoropolyether peroxide in a liquid phase, or with wide range of fluoroorganic substances by CVD-method. Such materials combine high hydrophobicity and chemical stability with electrical and thermal conductivity and can be used as electrode material for super capacitors. Sulfonic acid functional groups can be attached to activated carbon to give \\"starbons\\" which can be used to selectively catalyse the esterification of fatty acids. Formation of such activated carbons from halogenated precursors gives a more effective catalyst which is thought to be a result of remaining halogens improving stability. It is reported about synthesis of activated carbon with chemically grafted superacid sites ‚ÄìCF2SO3H. Some of the chemical properties of activated carbon have been attributed to presence of the surface active carbon double bond. The Polyani adsorption theory is a popular method for analyzing adsorption of various organic substances to their surface. Examples of adsorption =Heterogeneous catalysis= The most commonly encountered form of chemisorption in industry, occurs when a solid catalyst interacts with a gaseous feedstock, the reactant/s. The adsorption of reactant/s to the catalyst surface creates a chemical bond, altering the electron density around the reactant molecule and allowing it to undergo reactions that would not normally be available to it. Reactivation and regeneration World's largest reactivation plant located in , Belgium. Activated carbon reactivation center in Roeselare, Belgium. The reactivation or the regeneration of activated carbons involves restoring the adsorptive capacity of saturated activated carbon by desorbing adsorbed contaminants on the activated carbon surface. =Thermal reactivation= The most common regeneration technique employed in industrial processes is thermal reactivation. The thermal regeneration process generally follows three steps: * Adsorbent drying at approximately * High temperature desorption and decomposition () under an inert atmosphere * Residual organic gasification by a non-oxidising gas (steam or carbon dioxide) at elevated temperatures () The heat treatment stage utilises the exothermic nature of adsorption and results in desorption, partial cracking and polymerization of the adsorbed organics. The final step aims to remove charred organic residue formed in the porous structure in the previous stage and re- expose the porous carbon structure regenerating its original surface characteristics. After treatment the adsorption column can be reused. Per adsorption-thermal regeneration cycle between 5‚Äì15 wt% of the carbon bed is burnt off resulting in a loss of adsorptive capacity. Thermal regeneration is a high energy process due to the high required temperatures making it both an energetically and commercially expensive process. Plants that rely on thermal regeneration of activated carbon have to be of a certain size before it is economically viable to have regeneration facilities onsite. As a result, it is common for smaller waste treatment sites to ship their activated carbon cores to specialised facilities for regeneration. =Other regeneration techniques= Current concerns with the high energy/cost nature of thermal regeneration of activated carbon has encouraged research into alternative regeneration methods to reduce the environmental impact of such processes. Though several of the regeneration techniques cited have remained areas of purely academic research, some alternatives to thermal regeneration systems have been employed in industry. Current alternative regeneration methods are: * Chemical and solvent regeneration * Microbial regeneration * Electrochemical regeneration * Ultrasonic regeneration * Wet air oxidation See also * Activated charcoal cleanse * Biochar * Bamboo charcoal * Binch≈çtan * Bone char * Carbon filtering * Carbocatalysis * Conjugated microporous polymer * Hydrogen storage * Kv√¶rner-process * Onboard refueling vapor recovery References External links * \\"Imaging the atomic structure of activated carbon\\" ‚Äì Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter * \\"How Does Activated Carbon Work?\\" at Slate * \\"Worshiping the False Idols of Wellness\\" on activated charcoal as a useless wellness practice at The New York Times Category:Carbon forms Category:Filters Category:Toxicology treatments Category:Excipients Category:World Health Organization essential medicines Category:Gas technologies Category:Charcoal ","title":"Activated carbon"},{"id":"395378","text":"Edward Frank \\"Ed\\" Limato (July 10, 1936 - July 3, 2010) was an American talent agent and a senior vice president at the William Morris Agency, representing clients such as Michelle Pfeiffer, Nicolas Cage, Mel Gibson, Steve Martin, Diana Ross, Richard Gere, and Denzel Washington.Noland, Claire (July 4, 2010).

A slightly different definition is used by some authors, and there are other useful equivalent formulations of the definition; these are discussed below.  Definition  Let be a topological space with topology . A subbase of is usually defined as a subcollection of satisfying one of the two following equivalent conditions: #The subcollection generates the topology . This means that is the smallest topology containing : any topology on containing must also contain . #The collection of open sets consisting of all finite intersections of elements of , together with the set , forms a basis for . This means that every proper open set in can be written as a union of finite intersections of elements of . Explicitly, given a point in an open set , there are finitely many sets of , such that the intersection of these sets contains and is contained in . (If we use the nullary intersection convention, then there is no need to include in the second definition.) For subcollection of the power set , there is a unique topology having as a subbase. In particular, the intersection of all topologies on containing satisfies this condition. In general, however, there is no unique subbasis for a given topology. Thus, we can start with a fixed topology and find subbases for that topology, and we can also start with an arbitrary subcollection of the power set and form the topology generated by that subcollection. We can freely use either equivalent definition above; indeed, in many cases, one of the two conditions is more useful than the other. = Alternative definition = Sometimes, a slightly different definition of subbase is given which requires that the subbase cover . In this case, is the union of all sets contained in . This means that there can be no confusion regarding the use of nullary intersections in the definition. However, this definition is not always equivalent to the two definitions above. In other words, there exist topological spaces with a subset , such that is the smallest topology containing , yet does not cover (such an example is given below). In practice, this is a rare occurrence; e.g. a subbase of a space that has at least two points and satisfies the T1 separation axiom must be a cover of that space.  Examples  The topology generated by any subset (including by the empty set ) is equal to the trivial topology }. If is a topology on and is a basis for then the topology generated by is . Thus any basis for a topology is also a subbasis for . If is any subset of then the topology generated by will be a subset of . The usual topology on the real numbers has a subbase consisting of all semi-infinite open intervals either of the form or , where and are real numbers. Together, these generate the usual topology, since the intersections for generate the usual topology. A second subbase is formed by taking the subfamily where and are rational. The second subbase generates the usual topology as well, since the open intervals with , rational, are a basis for the usual Euclidean topology. The subbase consisting of all semi-infinite open intervals of the form alone, where is a real number, does not generate the usual topology. The resulting topology does not satisfy the T1 separation axiom, since all open sets have a non-empty intersection. The initial topology on defined by a family of functions , where each has a topology, is the coarsest topology on such that each is continuous. Because continuity can be defined in terms of the inverse images of open sets, this means that the initial topology on is given by taking all , where ranges over all open subsets of , as a subbasis. Two important special cases of the initial topology are the product topology, where the family of functions is the set of projections from the product to each factor, and the subspace topology, where the family consists of just one function, the inclusion map. The compact-open topology on the space of continuous functions from to has for a subbase the set of functions :V(K,U) = \\\\\\\\{f\\\\colon X\\\\to Y \\\\mid f(K) \\\\subseteq U \\\\\\\\} where is compact and is an open subset of . Suppose that is a Hausdorff topological space with containing two or more elements (e.g. with the Euclidean topology). Let be any non-empty open subset of (e.g. could be a non-empty bounded open interval in ) and let denote the subspace topology on that inherits from (so ). Then the topology generated by on is equal to the union (see this footnote for an explanation),Since is a topology on and is an open subset of , it is easy to verify that is a topology on . Since isn't a topology on , is clearly the smallest topology on containing ). where (since is Hausdorff, equality will hold if and only if ). Note that if is a proper subset of , then is the smallest topology on containing yet does not cover (i.e. the union is a proper subset of ).  Results using subbases  One nice fact about subbases is that continuity of a function need only be checked on a subbase of the range. That is, if is a map between topological spaces and if is a subbase for , then is continuous if and only if is open in for every . A net (or sequence) converges to a point if and only if every subbasic neighborhood of contains all for sufficiently large . = Alexander subbase theorem = There is one significant result concerning subbases, due to James Waddell Alexander II. Note that the corresponding result for basic open covers is much easier to prove. :Alexander Subbase Theorem: Let be a topological space. If has a subbasis such that every cover of by elements from has a finite subcover, then is compact. The converse to this theorem also holds and it is proven by using (since every topology is a subbasis for itself). :If is compact and is a subbasis for , every cover of by elements from has a finite subcover. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that the space is not compact (so is an infinite set), yet every subbasic cover from has a finite subcover. Let denote the set of all open covers of that do not have any finite subcover of . Partially order by subset inclusion and use Zorn's Lemma to find an element that is a maximal element of . Observe that: 1. Since , by definition of , is an open cover of and there does not exist any finite subset of that covers (so in particular, is infinite). 2. The maximality of in implies that if is an open set of such that then has a finite subcover, which must necessarily be of the form for some finite subset of (this finite subset depends on the choice of ). We will begin by showing that is not a cover of . Suppose that was a cover of , which in particular implies that is a cover of by elements of . The theorem's hypothesis on implies that there exists a finite subset of that covers , which would simultaneously also be a finite subcover of by elements of (since ). But this contradicts , which proves that does not cover . Since does not cover , there exists some that is not covered by (that is, is not contained in any element of ). But since does cover , there also exists some such that . Since is a subbasis generating 's topology, from the definition of the topology generated by , there must exist a finite collection of subbasic open sets such that :. We will now show by contradiction that for every . If was such that , then also so the fact that would then imply that is covered by , which contradicts how was chosen (recall that was chosen specifically so that it was not covered by ). As mentioned earlier, the maximality of in implies that for every , there exists a finite subset of such that forms a finite cover of . Define :. which is a finite subset of . Observe that for every , is a finite cover of so let us replace every with . Let denote the union of all sets in (which is an open subset of ) and let denote the complement of in . Observe that for any subset , covers if and only if . In particular, for every , the fact that covers implies that . Since was arbitrary, we have . Recalling that , we thus have , which is equivalent to being a cover of . Moreover, is a finite cover of with . Thus has a finite subcover of , which contradicts the fact that . Therefore the original assumption that is not compact must be wrong, which proves that is compact. ‚àé Although this proof makes use of Zorn's Lemma, the proof does not need the full strength of choice. Instead, it relies on the intermediate Ultrafilter principle. Using this theorem with the subbase for above, one can give a very easy proof that bounded closed intervals in are compact. Tychonoff's theorem, that the product of compact spaces is compact, also has a short proof. The product topology on has, by definition, a subbase consisting of cylinder sets that are the inverse projections of an open set in one factor. Given a subbasic family of the product that does not have a finite subcover, we can partition into subfamilies that consist of exactly those cylinder sets corresponding to a given factor space. By assumption, no has a finite subcover. Being cylinder sets, this means their projections onto have no finite subcover, and since each is compact, we can find a point that is not covered by the projections of onto . But then is not covered by . Note, that in the last step we implicitly used the axiom of choice (which is actually equivalent to Zorn's lemma) to ensure the existence of .

Primase catalyzes the synthesis of a short RNA (or DNA in some organisms) segment called a primer complementary to a ssDNA (single-stranded DNA) template. After this elongation, the RNA piece is removed by a 5' to 3' exonuclease and refilled with DNA.  Function  Asymmetry in the synthesis of leading and lagging strands, with role of DNA primase shown Steps in DNA synthesis, with role of DNA primase shown In bacteria, primase binds to the DNA helicase forming a complex called the primosome. Primase is activated by the helicase where it then synthesizes a short RNA primer approximately 11 ¬±1 nucleotides long, to which new nucleotides can be added by DNA polymerase. Archaeal and eukaryote primases are heterodimeric proteins with one large regulatory and one small catalytic subunit. The RNA segments are first synthesized by primase and then elongated by DNA polymerase. Then the DNA polymerase forms a protein complex with two primase subunits to form the alpha DNA Polymerase primase complex. Primase is one of the most error prone and slow polymerases. Primases in organisms such as E. coli synthesize around 2000 to 3000 primers at the rate of one primer per second. Primase also acts as a halting mechanism to prevent the leading strand from outpacing the lagging strand by halting the progression of the replication fork. The rate determining step in primase is when the first phosphodiester bond is formed between two molecules of RNA. The replication mechanisms differ between different bacteria and viruses where the primase covalently link to helicase in viruses such as the T7 bacteriophage. In viruses such as the herpes simplex virus (HSV-1), primase can form complexes with helicase. The primase-helicase complex is used to unwind dsDNA (double-stranded) and synthesizes the lagging strand using RNA primers The majority of primers synthesized by primase are two to three nucleotides long.  Types  There are two main types of primase: DnaG found in most bacteria, and the AEP (Archaeo-Eukaryote Primase) superfamily found in archaean and eukaryotic primases. While bacterial primases (DnaG-type) are composed of a single protein unit (a monomer) and synthesize RNA primers, AEP primases are usually composed of two different primase units (a heterodimer) and synthesize two-part primers with both RNA and DNA components. While functionally similar, the two primase superfamilies evolved independently of each other. = DnaG = The crystal structure of primase in E. coli with a core containing the DnaG protein was determined in the year 2000. The DnaG and primase complex is cashew shaped and contains three subdomains. The central subdomain forms a toprim fold which is made of a mixture five beta sheets and six alpha helices. The toprim fold is used for binding regulators and metals. The primase uses a phosphotransfer domain for the transfer coordination of metals, which makes it distinct from other polymerases. The side subunits contain a NH2 and COOH terminal made of alpha helixes and beta sheets. The NH2 terminal interacts with a zinc binding domain and COOH-terminal region which interacts with DnaB-ID. The Toprim fold is also found in topoisomerase and mitochrondrial Twinkle primase/helicase. Some DnaG- like (bacteria-like; ) primases have been found in archaeal genomes. = AEP = Eukaryote and archaeal primases tend to be more similar to each other, in terms of structure and mechanism, than they are to bacterial primases. The archaea-eukaryotic primase (AEP) superfamily, which most eukaryal and archaeal primase catalytic subunits belong to, has recently been redefined as a primase-polymerase family in recognition of the many other roles played by enzymes in this family. This classification also emphasizes the broad origins of AEP primases; the superfamily is now recognized as transitioning between RNA and DNA functions. Archaeal and eukaryote primases are heterodimeric proteins with one large regulatory (human PRIM2, p58) and one small catalytic subunit (human PRIM1, p48/p49). The large subunit contains a N-terminal 4Fe‚Äì4S cluster, split out in some archaea as PriX/PriCT. The large subunit is implicated in improving the activity and specificity of the small subunit. For example, removing the part corresponding to the large subunit in a fusion protein PolpTN2 results in a slower enzyme with reverse transcriptase activity.  Multifunctional primases  Figure 1. Select multifunctional primases across three domains of life (eukaryota, archaea, and bacteria). The ability of a primase to perform a particular activity is indicated by a check mark. Adapted from. The AEP family of primase-polymerases has diverse features beyond making only primers. In addition to priming DNA during replication, AEP enzymes may have additional functions in the DNA replication process, such as polymerization of DNA or RNA, terminal transfer, translesion synthesis (TLS), non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), and possibly in restarting stalled replication forks. Primases typically synthesize primers from ribonucleotides (NTPs); however, primases with polymerase capabilities also have an affinity for deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs). Primases with terminal transferase functionality are capable of adding nucleotides to the 3‚Äô end of a DNA strand independently of a template. Other enzymes involved in DNA replication, such as helicases, may also exhibit primase activity. =In eukaryotes and archaea= Human PrimPol (ccdc111) serves both primase and polymerase functions, like many archaeal primases; exhibits terminal transferase activity in the presence of manganese; and plays a significant role in translesion synthesis and in restarting stalled replication forks. PrimPol is actively recruited to damaged sites through its interaction with RPA, an adapter protein that facilitates DNA replication and repair. PrimPol has a zinc finger domain similar to that of some viral primases, which is essential for translesion synthesis and primase activity and may regulate primer length. Unlike most primases, PrimPol is uniquely capable of starting DNA chains with dNTPs. PriS, the archaeal primase small subunit, has a role in translesion synthesis (TLS) and can bypass common DNA lesions. Most archaea lack the specialized polymerases that perform TLS in eukaryotes and bacteria. PriS alone preferentially synthesizes strings of DNA; but in combination with PriL, the large subunit, RNA polymerase activity is increased. In Sulfolobus solfataricus, the primase heterodimer PriSL can act as a primase, polymerase, and terminal transferase. PriSL is thought to initiate primer synthesis with NTPs and then switch to dNTPs. The enzyme can polymerize RNA or DNA chains, with DNA products reaching as long as 7000 nucleotides (7 kb). It is suggested that this dual functionality may be a common feature of archaeal primases. =In bacteria= AEP multifutional primases also appear in bacteria and phages that infect them. They can display novel domain organizations with domains that bring even more functions beyond polymerization. Bacterial LigD () is primarily involved in the NHEJ pathway. It has an AEP superfamily polymerase/primase domain, a 3'-phosphoesterase domain, and a ligase domain. It is also capable of primase, DNA and RNA polymerase, and terminal transferase activity. DNA polymerization activity can produce chains over 7000 nucleotides (7 kb) in length, while RNA polymerization produces chains up to 1 kb long. = In viruses and plasmids = AEP enzymes are widespread, and can be found encoded in mobile genetic elements including virus/phages and plasmids. They either use them as a sole replication protein or in combination with other replication-associated proteins, such as helicases and, less frequently, DNA polymerases. Whereas the presence of AEP in eukaryotic and archaeal viruses is expected in that they mirror their hosts, bacterial viruses and plasmids also as frequently encode AEP-superfamily enzymes as they do DnaG-family primases. A great diversity of AEP families has been uncovered in various bacterial plasmids by comparative genomics surveys. Their evolutionary history is currently unknown, as these found in bacteria and baceriophages appear too different from their archaeo-eukaryotic homologs for a recent horizontal gene transfer. MCM-like helicase in Bacillus cereus strain ATCC 14579 (BcMCM; ) is an SF6 helicase fused with an AEP primase. The enzyme has both primase and polymerase functions in addition to helicase function. The gene coding for it is found in a prophage. It bears homology to ORF904 of plasmid pRN1 from Sulfolobus islandicus, which has an AEP PrimPol domain. Vaccinia virus D5 and HSV Primase are examples of AEP-helicase fusion as well. PolpTN2 is an Archaeal primase found in the TN2 plasmid. A fusion of domains homologous to PriS and PriL, it exhibits both primase and DNA polymerase activity, as well as terminal transferase function. Unlike most primases, PolpTN2 forms primers composed exclusively of dNTPs. Unexpectedly, when the PriL-like domain was truncated, PolpTN2 could also synthesize DNA on the RNA template, i.e., acted as an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase). Even DnaG primases can have extra functions, if given the right domains. The T7 phage gp4 is a DnaG primase-helicase fusion, and performs both functions in replication.

Hastings County is located in the province of Ontario, Canada. Geographically, it is located on the border of Eastern Ontario and Central Ontario. Hastings County is the second largest county in Ontario. The county seat is Belleville, which is independent of Hastings County. Hastings County has trademarked the moniker \\"Cheese Capital of Canada\\". Administrative divisions The 14 local municipalities within Hastings County are: * Town of Bancroft * Town of Deseronto * Municipality of Centre Hastings * Municipality of Hastings Highlands * Municipality of Tweed * Municipality of Marmora and Lake * Township of Carlow/Mayo * Township of Faraday * Township of Limerick * Township of Madoc * Township of Stirling- Rawdon * Township of Tudor and Cashel * Township of Tyendinaga * Township of Wollaston The Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory is within the Hastings census division but is independent of the county. The cities of Belleville and Quinte West are separated municipalities, falling within the boundaries of the county and included in the Hastings census division, but not under the administration of the county government.  History  The first boundaries of Hastings County (named for Francis Rawdon-Hastings) was organized for electoral purposes in 1792, and was described as being: For the initial elections to the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada, it was united with Northumberland County and most of Lennox County for purposes of returning one member.Proclamation of July 16, 1792 It was situated within the Mecklenburg District, which was later renamed the \\"Midland District\\" in 1792. In 1798, the Parliament of Upper Canada passed legislation to provide, that, at the beginning of 1800: The territory withdrawn from the County continued to form part of the Midland District.1798 Act, s. 18 In 1821, the newly surveyed townships of Elzevir, Madoc and Marmora were added to the County. While in this time agriculture was the most important industry in Hastings County, by 1822 (when the Marmora Iron Works was approaching its peak production) mining was playing an increasingly more important role in the area's economy. Prominent citizens of Hastings County and Ameliasburgh Township unsuccessfully petitioned the provincial government for district status during 1817, 1818, 1823 and 1825. After Prince Edward County successfully achieved its own government in 1831, Hastings County continued to send petitions throughout the 30s before finally achieving the status of a separate district in March 1837. It was constituted as the District of Victoria in 1839 (which continued until its dissolution in 1850). By 1845, the County was declared to consist of the following townships: * Elzevir * Grimsthorpe * Hungerford * Huntingdon * Lake * Marmora * Madoc * Rawdon * Sydney * Tudor * Thurlow * Tyendinaga Belleville, after an abortive attempt two years previously, was organized as a municipality with its own Board of Police in 1836, and was designated as the district seat in 1837.1837 Act, s. 1 It was constituted as a town under the Baldwin Act in 1850, and later became a city in 1877. Edward Fidlar became the first warden of Hastings County with their first meeting on January 28, 1850. By this time the Hastings County Council was also interested in education and the building of the railroad. On October 27, 1856 the first railroad train arrived in Belleville and by 1864 around 100 people were employed by the railroad. In August 1866, discovery of gold at Eldorado, near Madoc, caused great excitement throughout Hastings County as people flooded to the area from all over North America.

Roebling Suspension Bridge, originally known as the Cincinnati- Covington Bridge, spans the Ohio River between Cincinnati, Ohio, and Covington, Kentucky. When opened on December 1, 1866, it was the longest suspension bridge in the world at main span, which was later overtaken by John A. Roebling's most famous design of the 1883 Brooklyn Bridge at . Pedestrians use the bridge to get between the sports venues in Cincinnati (Paul Brown Stadium, Great American Ball Park, and U.S. Bank Arena) and the hotels, bars, restaurants, and parking lots in Northern Kentucky. The bar and restaurant district at the foot of the bridge on the Kentucky side is known as Roebling Point. Ramps were constructed leading directly from the bridge to the Dixie Terminal building used for streetcars. These provided Covington‚ÄìCincinnati streetcars \\"with a grade-separated route to the center of downtown, and the terminal building was originally intended to connect, via underground pedestrian passages, with the never-built Fountain Square Station of the infamous Cincinnati Subway.\\" When streetcar service ceased in the 1950s, the terminal was converted to a diesel bus terminal. The ramps were removed in 1998 when it ceased being used as a bus terminal. Planning and charter left In the mid-19th century, need of a passage over the Ohio River became apparent. Commerce between Ohio and Kentucky had increased to the point that the highly congested steamboat traffic was constricting the economy. A solution that would not constrict traffic on the river even further was a wire cable suspension bridge of the type developed by French engineers. Several American engineers had begun designing and building suspension bridges. One of these men was John A. Roebling of Saxonburg, Pennsylvania. The Ohio River, however, was much wider than any river that had been bridged in France. The Covington and Cincinnati Bridge Company was incorporated in February 1846, and the company asked Roebling to plan a bridge. The brief outline of his ideas called for a span with of clearance at high water to allow steamboats to pass unobstructed, but it included a monumental tower in the middle of the river. Steamboat and ferry interest groups lobbied against this plan. They feared an obstructed waterway, loss of a ferry market, and depreciation of property. The Ohio legislature refused the charter of the bridge. In September, Roebling published a 36-page report containing a technical discussion and an analysis of said problems. He attacked steamboat operators for using oversized chimneys, speculated on future commercial interests, and surmised on the importance of spanning western rivers. Roebling also specified that the company should make the decision as to the placement of the bridge along the river. Still, no charter was granted. left After observing the construction of a suspension bridge upriver, in Wheeling, Virginia (later West Virginia), the legislature relented and passed the charter, mandating excessive dimensions such as a main span and requesting that the legislature determine the bridge location. This latter provision would later be regretted by everyone involved. The roads of Cincinnati and Covington were laid collinear with each other, in the hope that a bridge would be built sometime in the future. When the Ohio legislature decided to choose its own location for the bridge, it failed to pick such an obvious spot, hoping to defend Cincinnati's preeminence over Newport and Covington, the rival Kentucky cities. The bridge was actually located almost entirely in Kentucky because the state boundary follows the north bank of the river. It deprived Cincinnati forever of one of \\"the finest and most magnificent avenues on this continent.\\" Roebling Suspension Bridge in 1906 In 1854, a small suspension bridge over the Licking River at Newport, Kentucky, collapsed. This event deterred investors, and the bridge company could not raise enough money to start construction. Amos Shinkle was elected to the board of trustees in 1856. He brought with him a much needed boost of energy. Shinkle immediately managed to find new private investors and to procure more support from both the Ohio and Kentucky governments. During this time the bridge charter was revised, and the span of the bridge was reduced to a minimum of . By now, Roebling had established a reputation. President Ramson of the bridge company traveled to see Roebling, who was in Iowa, and he secured a contract to build the bridge. In September, Roebling arrived in Cincinnati, and much to his disgust, nothing was prepared. Roebling Suspension Bridge at night Construction Excavation for the foundation of the Covington tower commenced in September 1856 and went smoothly. A foundation was set consisting of 13 layers of oak beams, each layer set perpendicular to the one beneath it, bolted with iron hardware, and finally all cemented into place. On the Cincinnati side, work was delayed from the start. The construction crews could not pump water out of the excavating pit fast enough. After months of little progress, Roebling decided against buying costly machinery or bigger engines for his pumps and, quite last minute, designed his own square positive displacement pumps from three-inch (76 mm) pine planks. He built them locally in about forty-eight hours and ran them off of one of Amos Shinkles' tugboats, the Champion No.1. The homemade pumps displaced forty gallons of mud and clay in each cycle. When the crews reached the compacted gravel bed of the Ohio River, Roebling decided this would be sufficient for the foundation of the Cincinnati tower. Oak timbers were laid, mirroring the foundation of the Covington tower, and within three months, masonry on both towers reached above the waterline (which, at this time, was at a record low for the fall). Work halted for the freezing temperatures and increased water level, a practice which continued seasonally until completion of the bridge. At this time, a revised contract was drawn up, stating work was to be completed by December 1858, barring \\"unavoidable calamities\\". After a hard winter of 1856‚Äì57, and a wet spring, construction resumed in July 1857. Sandstone was used for the first twenty five vertical feet of each tower base. Limestone encased this sandstone to protect against scour and collision from watercraft. The remaining height of each tower was to be constructed of sandstone, rough cut and with a large draft. Roebling said this gave the towers \\"a massive look, quite suitable to their function.\\" Working from July to August 1857, the company was without liquid funds, a problem compounded by the Panic of 1857. Work halted because of the inability to pay for the project. In July 1858, operations resumed again, albeit with a smaller workforce. Only one tower was worked on at a time. President Ramson of the company died, and no work was be done during the years 1859‚Äì60. In November 1860, Abraham Lincoln was elected president of the United States, and the Civil War began in January 1861. Upon a threatened siege of Cincinnati from Confederate forces, a pontoon bridge was built to span the Ohio River, allowing Union troops to cross and construct defenses. Soon after, once it had become obvious that a permanent structure was vital, money from investors came pouring in. Bonds were sold, and in January 1863 materials began arriving. In the interest of building more quickly, the requirement for the height of the main span was lowered to . Preparations to resume construction were made. Machinery was ordered, and new derricks were built, but a renewed threat of invasion again temporarily halted progress. Finally, in the spring of 1863, work commenced and continued until the end of the year. Aerial view of the bridge In the spring of 1864, work resumed again. Although Roebling operated his own wire mill at Trenton, New Jersey, the bridge company purchased one million pounds of wire from Richard Johnson at Manchester, England, for the cables that would span the width of the river. Roebling had used Johnson's wire for one of his other bridges. He preferred it over wire made in the United States because it was of better quality and greater tensile strength. Anchorages on both shores were constructed of limestone base and a freestone finish. Eleven-ton iron anchors were embedded in each block, securing cables with wrought iron chain links of Roebling's patent. The Civil War depleted the work force on the project, hindering speed and efficiency until its end. Work on the bridge proceeded steadily after the end of the war. In September 1865 the first two wire ropes were laid. They were unwound from a spool on a barge, allowed to sink to the bottom of the river, then raised in unison from the riverbed. Wooden crossbeams were laid at regular intervals from the wire ropes, and a simple footbridge was constructed for the benefit of the workers. With the Ohio River \\"spanned,\\" there was a final push to complete the project even through floods and freezing temperatures. The cabling of the bridge went at a feverish pace, with about eighty wires placed per day. Hundreds watched the spider-like process from both shores. And on June 23, 1866, the last wire was taken across, for a total of 10,360 wires. These were subsequently compressed together and wrapped with an outer covering of wire into two cables of 5,180 wires each. Suspenders were hung from the cables by the end of August, and of oak lumber was laid as the floor across 300 wrought iron suspended beams. Two tracks for streetcars were laid. Diagonal stays were added to increase load capacity, strengthen the floor, and check vibration. Wrought iron trusses were added, running the length of the bridge. On December 1, 1866, pedestrians walked upon the bridge, known locally only as \\"The Suspension Bridge,\\" for the first time. Over 166,000 people walked across in the first two days. Final touches were put on the bridge over the next few months, and construction officially ended in July 1867. Two men died during construction. When the Roebling Bridge was formally opened on January 1, 1867, the driver of a horse and buggy was charged a toll of 15 cents to cross; the toll for three horses and a carriage was 25 cents. Pedestrians were charged one cent. Alterations and designations A view of the John A. Roebling Suspension Bridge from the third floor of the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center in Cincinnati The original deck of the bridge was built at the lowest possible cost because of Civil War inflation, but the stone towers had been designed to carry a much heavier load than was originally demanded. In 1896, the bridge received a second set of main cables, a wider steel deck, and a longer northern approach. The reconstruction significantly altered the appearance of the bridge, but the new 30-ton weight limit extended its usefulness through the 20th century and beyond. In 1976, in honor of America's bicentennial, the bridge was painted blue (rather than brown). The Covington- Cincinnati Bridge Company‚Äîa private company‚Äîoperated the bridge until the Commonwealth of Kentucky purchased it in 1953 for $4.2 million. The state collected tolls until 1963 when the Brent Spence Bridge was opened on Interstate 75, downstream, approximately to the west of The Roebling Suspension Bridge. The bridge was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1975 and was designated a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1983. It remains the busiest of Cincinnati's four non-freeway automobile or pedestrian bridges. Initially called the \\"Covington-Cincinnati Suspension Bridge\\" or \\"Ohio River Bridge\\", it was renamed in honor of its designer and builder on June 27, 1983. The Commonwealth of Kentucky closed the bridge on November 13, 2006, to make extensive repairs to the structure. It reopened in late March. However, it closed again for much of 2008 for repainting. On September 11, 2007, the Commonwealth of Kentucky reduced the weight limit to 11 tons to prevent future structural damage following an analysis by the University of Kentucky. The lower weight limit prevents buses from crossing the bridge. The Commonwealth of Kentucky once again closed the bridge on April 7, 2010, for a complete repainting; the bridge reopened in November 2010. The closing of the bridge only affected vehicular traffic, while one pedestrian lane remained open. On January 10, 2013, a large piece of sandstone fell from the north tower causing the bridge to be closed for approximately 4 hours during rush hour. This time was used to remove debris and inspect the tower for further damage. On March 21, 2018, an automobile accident damaged a steel section of the bridge built in 1890. The bridge reopened in April 2018.

Etymology The etymology of Calypso's name is from (), meaning \\"to cover\\", \\"to conceal\\", \\"to hide\\", or \\"to deceive\\".Entry Œ∫Œ±ŒªœçœÄœÑœâ at LSJ According to Etymologicum Magnum, her name means \\"concealing the knowledge\\" (), which ‚Äì combined with the Homeric epithet (, meaning \\"subtle\\" or \\"wily\\") ‚Äì justifies the eremitic character of Calypso and her island. Mythology Calypso is generally said to be the daughter of the Titan AtlasHomer, Odyssey, 1.14, 1.51-54, 7.245; Apollodorus, E.7.24. She is sometimes referred to as Atlantis (ŒëœÑŒªŒ±ŒΩœÑŒØœÇ), which means the daughter of Atlas, see the entry ŒëœÑŒªŒ±ŒΩœÑŒØœÇ in Liddell & Scott, and also Hesiod, Theogony 938. and Pleione.Hyginus. Fabulae, Preface Hesiod, and the Homeric Hymn to Demeter, mention either a different Calypso or possibly the same Calypso as one of the Oceanid daughters of Tethys and Oceanus.Hesiod, Theogony 359; Homeric Hymn 2.422. According to Caldwell, p. 49 n. 359, the Hesiod Oceanid is \\"probably not\\" the same; see also West 1966, p. 267 359. Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·º±ŒºŒµœÅœåŒµœÉœÉŒ± ŒöŒ±ŒªœÖœàœé; Hard, p. 41. Apollodorus includes the name Calypso in his list of Nereids, the daughters of Nereus and Doris.Apollodorus, 1.2.7 In Homer's Odyssey, Calypso attempts to keep the fabled Greek hero Odysseus on her island to make him her immortal husband. According to Homer, Calypso kept Odysseus prisoner at Ogygia for seven years.Homer, Odyssey 7.259 Calypso enchants Odysseus with her singing as she moves to and fro, weaving on her loom with a golden shuttle. Odysseus soon comes to wish for circumstances to change. He can no longer bear being separated from his wife, Penelope, and wants to go to Calypso to tell her. His patron goddess Athena asks Zeus to order the release of Odysseus from the island, and Zeus orders the messenger Hermes to tell Calypso to set Odysseus free, for it was not his destiny to live with her forever. She angrily comments on how the gods hate goddesses having affairs with mortals, but eventually concedes, sending Odysseus on his way after providing him with wine, bread, and the materials for a raft. Homer does not mention any children by Calypso. By some accounts, which come after the Odyssey, Calypso bore Odysseus a son, Latinus,Apollodorus, E.7.24 though Circe is usually given as Latinus' mother.Hesiod, Theogony 1011 In other accounts, Calypso bore Odysseus two children: Nausithous and Nausinous.See Hesiod, Theogony 1019, Sir James George Frazer in his notes to Apollodorus, E.7.24, says that these verses \\"are probably not by Hesiod but have been interpolated by a later poet of the Roman era in order to provide the Latins with a distinguished Greek ancestry\\". The story of Odysseus and Calypso has some close resemblances to the interactions between Gilgamesh and Siduri in the Epic of Gilgamesh in that \\"the lone female plies the inconsolable hero-wanderer with drink and sends him off to a place beyond the sea reserved for a special class of honoured people\\" and \\"to prepare for the voyage he has to cut down and trim timbers.\\"Dalley, S. (1989) Myths from Mesopotamia. Oxford University Press, Oxford, NY. Philosophy Philosophers have written about the meaning of Calypso in the Ancient Greek world. Ryan Patrick Hanley commented on the interpretation of Calypso in Les Aventures de T√©l√©maque written by F√©nelon. Hanley says that the story of Calypso illustrates the link between Eros and pride. Theodore Adorno and Max Horkheimer brought attention to the combination of power over fate and the sensibility of \\"bourgeois housewives\\" in the depiction of Calypso.

His parents were Anna Louisa, n√©e de la Hooke (1824‚Äì1907) and Alfred William Otter (1815‚Äì1866),The son of William Otter, Bishop of Chichester both English immigrants who married in Ontario on 15 September 1842. He began his military career in the Non-Permanent Active Militia in Toronto in 1864. Captain William Otter was Adjutant of the Queen's Own Rifles of Toronto in 1866. He first saw combat with them at the Battle of Ridgeway during the Fenian Raids. He joined the Permanent Force as an infantry officer when Canada established its own professional infantry unit in 1883. On May 2, 1885, he led a Canadian force of more than 300 in the Battle of Cut Knife against Poundmaker's Cree Indians. Otter's tactics were ineffective against the defending warriors. He was appointed as the first Commanding Officer of the Royal Canadian Regiment of Infantry in 1893. Lieutenant Colonel William Dillon Otter During the Second Boer War, Otter, by then a Lieutenant Colonel, commanded the 2nd (Special Service) Battalion of The Royal Canadian Regiment of Infantry in South Africa, where they were considered by many British officers to be the best infantry battalion in the country. Otter played an important part in the Battle of Paardeberg. He became the first Canadian-born officer to command Canada's military in 1908, and retired in 1910 as a major general. In 1922 he was the second Canadian, after Sir Arthur Currie, to be appointed a full general. Otter had the reputation of being something of a martinet ‚Äì due mainly to his desire that the young Canadian Army should not show up badly when compared to British troops.Brian A Reid \\"Our Little Army in the Field ‚Äì The Canadians in the Boer War\\" He wrote The Guide: A Manual for the Canadian Militia (Infantry) Embracing the Interior Economy, Duties, Discipline, Drills and Parades, Dress, Books, and Correspondence of a Battalion with Regulations for Marches, Transport & Encampment, Also Forms & Bugle Calls in 1914, which includes sections on discipline, courts martial, offences, complaints, and defaulters. During the First World War he came out of retirement to command operations for the internment of enemy nationals resident in Canada. Otter headed the Otter Commission. The Otter Commission was tasked to establish links of perpetuation from the units of Canadian Expeditionary Force back to the institutionally separate units of the Canadian Militia in the years following the First World War. This establishment of perpetuation, based primarily on geographical connections through original recruiting areas of the CEF battalions, provided a basis by which the achievements and battle honours of the CEF units transferred back to the units of the standing Militia. Without this work of the Otter Commission the CEF and its achievements would have had no continuance with existing units of the Canadian Army today. General Sir William Otter died on 6 May 1929. Freemason Otter was initiated into the Ionic Lodge of Freemasonry in Toronto in February 1869. He became Worshipful Master in 1873.William Dillon Otter in Ionic Lodge Legacy William Dillon Otter sword at Royal Military College of Canada Otter Squadron, composed of University Training Plan Non Commissioned Member (UTPNCM) Officer Cadets, at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario, was named in his honour and the Cadet Squadron Leader of Otter Squadron is permitted to carry his sword on graduation parade.

Unlike Conan Doyle's self- controlled, analytical character, Sherlock Holmes, Professor Challenger is an aggressive, hot-tempered, dominating figure. Like Sherlock Holmes, Professor Challenger was based on a real person‚Äîin this case, an explorer named Percy Fawcett, who was Conan Doyle's friend, and a professor of physiology named William Rutherford, who had lectured at the University of Edinburgh while Conan Doyle studied medicine there.pxxiii in the Oxford ed of The Lost World.

Murray, London 1930. p32 Fictional character biography George Edward Challenger, FRS, MD, DSc, was born in Largs, Ayrshire in 1863 and educated at Largs Academy before studying at the University of Edinburgh. Dr Challenger was appointed to an assistant position at the British Museum in 1892 and was promoted within a year to assistant keeper in the Comparative Anthropology Department. He held a professorship in Zoology and was elected President of the Zoological Institute in London. Several of his inventions were successfully applied in industry and brought him additional income.A C Doyle, The Lost World, The Land of Mist and When the World Screamed in The Complete Professor Challenger Stories, 1952, London: John Murray: pp. 11, 173, 515 and 570; Martin Booth, The Doctor, the Detective and Arthur Conan Doyle, 1997, London: Hodder & Stoughton: p. 286. Edward Malone, the narrator of The Lost World, the 1912 novel in which Challenger first appeared, described his first meeting with the character: :His appearance made me gasp. I was prepared for something strange, but not for so overpowering a personality as this. It was his size, which took one's breath away ‚Äì his size and his imposing presence. His head was enormous, the largest I have ever seen upon a human being. I am sure that his top hat, had I ventured to don it, would have slipped over me entirely and rested on my shoulders. He had the face and beard, which I associate with an Assyrian bull; the former florid, the latter so black as almost to have a suspicion of blue, spade-shaped and rippling down over his chest. The hair was peculiar, plastered down in front in a long, curving wisp over his massive forehead. The eyes were blue-grey under great black tufts, very clear, very critical, and very masterful. A huge spread of shoulders and a chest like a barrel were the other parts of him which appeared above the table, save for two enormous hands covered with long black hair. This and a bellowing, roaring, rumbling voice made up my first impression of the notorious Professor Challenger.A C Doyle, The Lost World, in The Complete Professor Challenger Stories, 1952, London: John Murray: pp. 18-19; cited in Daniel Stashower, Teller of Tales: The Life of Arthur Conan Doyle, 1999, New York: Henry Holt and Company: p. 275. Challenger was also a pretentious and self-righteous scientific jack-of-all- trades. Although considered by Malone's editor, Mr McArdle, to be \\"just a homicidal megalomaniac with a turn for science\\", his ingenuity could be counted upon to solve any problem or get out of any unsavoury situation, and be sure to offend and insult several other people in the process. He was also seen as extremely vain by his colleagues: Edward Malone says that \\"he is convinced, of course, that he is destined for Westminster Abbey\\", and later speculates that \\"in his fancy, may he see himself sometimes, gracing the vacant pedestal in Trafalgar Square\\".. Challenger was, in many ways, rude, crude, and without social conscience or inhibition. Yet he was a man capable of great loyalty and his love of his wife was all-encompassing. Challenger married Jessica - ‚ÄòJessie‚Äô - and the couple settled at 14 Enmore Gardens, Enmore Park, Kensington, London.A C Doyle, The Lost World and When the World Screamed, in The Complete Professor Challenger Stories, 1952, London: John Murray: pp. 11, 24 and 547. In The Disintegration Machine and When the World Screamed the address is given as Enmore Gardens; see pp. 532 and 547 After his adventures in South America Challenger and his wife purchased The Briars, in Rotherfield, Sussex, as a second home.A C Doyle, The Poison Belt, in The Complete Professor Challenger Stories, 1952, London: John Murray: p. 221. Later, following his wife‚Äôs death from influenza, Challenger sold his London home and rented an apartment on the third floor in Victoria West Gardens, London.A C Doyle, The Land of Mist, in The Complete Professor Challenger Stories, 1952, London: John Murray: pp. 303 and 305. Challenger‚Äôs friend and biographer, the journalist Edward ‚ÄòTed‚Äô Dunn Malone married Enid Challenger, the Professor‚Äôs daughter, in the summer of 1927. Malone had been born in Ireland and achieved some fame in rugby football at international level for Ireland before a career in journalism at the Daily Gazette. Enid Challenger was a freelance reporter at the same newspaper.A C Doyle, The Lost World, The Land of Mist and When the World Screamed, in The Complete Professor Challenger Stories, 1952, London: John Murray: pp. 50, 304, 419, 517 and 561. In July 1908 Malone joined Challenger, the 66 year-old Mr Summerlee (c.1842-1925), Professor of Comparative Anatomy, and the explorer and mountaineer Lord John Roxton, third son of the Duke of Pomfret and then in his mid-forties, on an expedition to the Amazon Basin, where Challenger claimed to have observed creatures from the Jurassic Age two years previously. On reaching the mouth of the Amazon River in Par√° state the expedition hired local guides and servants Mojo, Jos√©, Fernando, Gomez, Manuel and Zambo.According to Malone‚Äôs diary, Challenger‚Äôs expedition was deep in Amazonia on Tuesday 18 August, which places the year as 1908. In the story Summerlee is said to be aged 66 and according to The Land of Mist he died in Naples the year previous to the events therein described; see A C Doyle, The Lost World and The Land of Mist, in The Complete Professor Challenger Stories, 1952, London: John Murray: pp. 47-48, 61-62, 64-65, 74, 324 and 399-400; Daniel Stashower, Teller of Tales: The Life of Arthur Conan Doyle, 1999, New York: Henry Holt and Company: p. 403. From Manaus the expedition continued up-river to reach an unnamed tributary, which they followed by canoe until by late August the explorers arrived in the Guiana Highlands and the great table-top mountain (tepui) that was The Lost World. The expedition camped at the foot of the basalt cliffs of the tepui, which they named Maple White Land in honour of the plateau‚Äôs discoverer some four years earlier.A C Doyle, The Lost World, in The Complete Professor Challenger Stories, 1952, London: John Murray: pp. 86-89 and 101. The isolated plateau was home to numerous prehistoric animals, previously known only from the fossil record, including pterodactyls, allosaurids, iguanodon and an early species of hominid. A group of indigenous people also occupied the plateau and the explorers aided them to subjugate the predatory ‚Äòape-men‚Äô. The expedition returned to London, bringing with them diamonds worth ¬£200,000. Professors Challenger and Summerlee presented their findings to the Zoological Institute on 7 November 1908 at the Queen‚Äôs Hall, Regent Street, London. They claimed to have discovered over 150 new species, some dating from the Early Jurassic.A C Doyle, The Lost World, in The Complete Professor Challenger Stories, 1952, London: John Murray: pp. 196-200 and 212; Martin Booth, The Doctor, the Detective and Arthur Conan Doyle, 1997, London: Hodder & Stoughton: pp. 286-287; Daniel Stashower, Teller of Tales: The Life of Arthur Conan Doyle, 1999, New York: Henry Holt and Company: pp. 274-276. Three years later the friends re-assembled in Challenger‚Äôs Sussex home to witness The Poison Belt incident of 27 to 28 August 1911. Challenger interpreted a shift in Fraunhofer‚Äôs light diffraction lines to predict that the Earth was passing through a deadly interstellar cloud of ether. By breathing oxygen from cylinders brought to the house earlier Challenger, his wife and friends avoided falling into catalepsy over the several hours the event lasted. It appeared as though all animal life on the planet had expired but within 28 hours all had recovered.The story is set three years after adventure to The Lost World but a date of Friday 27 August would place the story in either 1909, 1915, 1920 or 1926; A C Doyle, The Poison Belt, in The Complete Professor Challenger Stories, 1952, London: John Murray: pp. 217-219, 229, 293 and 297; Daniel Stashower, Teller of Tales: The Life of Arthur Conan Doyle, 1999, New York: Henry Holt and Company: pp. 277-278. Challenger was able to pursue his scientific interests independently as a result of a bequest by the rubber millionaire Betterton. He purchased an estate on Hengist Down near to his Sussex home, and engaged construction firm Morden & Company to begin sinking a vertical shaft to a depth of eight miles. In the spring of 1921 an American specialist in artesian wells Mr Peerless Jones was engaged to plunge his drilling rod a further hundred feet into the apparently-living protoplasmic substance that had been revealed at the bottom of the shaft. Challenger hoped through this experiment to prove that the Earth was a living organism that sustained its vitality from the ether of outer space. Preparations were ready by Tuesday 21 June 1921 and the drill breached the tissue, producing a loud scream and unleashing a geyser of a protective tar- like secretion, accompanied by global volcanic activity. It was the day When the World Screamed.An invitation for Tuesday 21 July places the story in 1921 or 1927; since Mrs Challenger is still alive in the story the earlier date is more plausible; A C Doyle, When the World Screamed, in The Complete Professor Challenger Stories, 1952, London: John Murray: pp. 547-550, 554, 559 and 570; Martin Booth, The Doctor, the Detective and Arthur Conan Doyle, 1997, London: Hodder & Stoughton: p. 350; Daniel Stashower, Teller of Tales: The Life of Arthur Conan Doyle, 1999, New York: Henry Holt and Company: p. 432. Some months later, Challenger and Malone were the last people to meet the Latvian inventor Theodore Nemor, who had claimed to have discovered the physics of disintegrating and then reassembling matter. Nemor was apparently seeking competing bids from the British and Soviet governments to buy The Disintegration Machine at the time of his unexplained disappearance from London.A C Doyle, The Disintegration Machine, in The Complete Professor Challenger Stories, 1952, London: John Murray: pp. 531-533, and 542; Martin Booth, The Doctor, the Detective and Arthur Conan Doyle, 1997, London: Hodder & Stoughton: pp. 349-350; Daniel Stashower, Teller of Tales: The Life of Arthur Conan Doyle, 1999, New York: Henry Holt and Company: p. 431. The death of Jessica Challenger affected her husband profoundly. Professor Challenger undertook an investigation into psychic phenomena after Ted Malone and Enid Challenger‚Äôs reports on spiritualism appeared in the Daily Gazette in October 1926. Lord John Roxton, Malone, and the Reverend Charles Mason, a former Church of England exorcist who had taken up Spiritualism, visited a haunted house at Dryfont in Derbyshire. An apparition at the house convinced the two friends of the reality of the spirit world and they set out to explore The Land of Mist further. Challenger joined the investigation ostensibly to demonstrate the fallacies of psychic research but became convinced of the reality of intercourse with the spirits of the dead and announced his conversion in a polemic carried by The Spectator magazine.A summons issued for Wednesday 17 November places the story in 1920 or 1926; the later date is more appropriate given the fact that Challenger‚Äôs wife is already dead for some years at the time of the story; A C Doyle, The Land of Mist, in The Complete Professor Challenger Stories, 1952, London: John Murray: pp. 303, 389, 400-406 and 516; Martin Booth, The Doctor, the Detective and Arthur Conan Doyle, 1997, London: Hodder & Stoughton: p. 337; Daniel Stashower, Teller of Tales: The Life of Arthur Conan Doyle, 1999, New York: Henry Holt and Company: pp. 403-405.

In the story, Edward Malone recounts how Sherlock Holmes was called upon to locate the vanished, seemingly kidnapped, Professor Challenger. The story also was reprinted in the anthology, The Misadventures of Sherlock Holmes (1944), edited by Ellery Queen. * Sherlock Holmes's War of the Worlds: Manly Wade Wellman and Wade Wellman. A slightly anachronistic romp, in which Sherlock Holmes and Challenger oppose H. G. Wells' Martian hordes and one of Holmes' old enemies. Holmes is the hero, but Challenger plays a major part. It is mentioned that Challenger helped Holmes solve the case of the Giant Rat of Sumatra. * Osamu Tezuka published in 1948 a manga version of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World. Tezuka's manga, however, is a Lost World unlike any other. Not an adaptation, this is a complete re-imagining of the story set on an alien planet. * There have been several other comic adaptations of Professor Challenger's exploits, but none that were particularly widespread and well known. A descendant of Professor Challenger, named Darwin Challenger, is a minor character in Valiant's Turok: Dinosaur Hunter comics, first appearing in issue #7. He bears a strong resemblance to his ancestor and makes numerous references to events in the Lost World. Professor Challenger and his companions are also referenced in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen series. According to writer Alan Moore, Challenger had a lifelong friendship with the zoologist Dr. Dolittle. Arguably the most notable appearance is the Dell Comics adaptation of the 1960 movie version of The Lost World, as an issue of their Four Color series.Four Color #1145, August 1960. * Return to the Lost World: Nicholas Nye. A sequel set a year later than The Lost World, which almost ignores the dinosaurs in favour of a plot involving parapsychology, an extremely odd version of evolutionary theory, and ancient technology in the style of Chariots of the Gods. While Conan Doyle's Challenger is a foe of scientific fraud, this novel begins with him preparing a scientific fake. * Challenger, alongside Nikola Tesla, plays a major role in two of Ralph Vaughan's four Sherlock Holmes/H. P. Lovecraft crossovers, The Adventure of the Dreaming Detective (1992) and Sherlock Holmes and the Terror Out of Time (2001). * \\"Sherlock Holmes in the Lost World\\" (2008) by Martin Powell in anthology Gaslight Grimoire (reprinted in Sherlock Holmes: The Crossover Casebook), in which Challenger is lost in the Lost World again and rescued by Sherlock Holmes. Challenger has a daughter who is also \\"Professor Challenger\\". * Dinosaur Summer: Greg Bear. Thirty years after Professor Challenger discovered dinosaurs in Venezuela, dinosaur circuses have become popular and are slipping out of the spotlight. The one remaining dinosaur circus makes a bold move to return their dinosaurs to the Tepuye plateau. Challenger himself never appears, but the protagonist's son attended Challenger High School. * In this sequel Professor Summerlee, Lord Roxton and the narrator Malone accompany Challenger on a journey to the moon, in a desperate bid to save the people of Ell Ka-Mar, who have crowned Challenger their king. * Challenger makes a guest appearance in the 3rd Plateau of Gilles Deleuze & F√©lix Guattari's post-structuralist philosophical text A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia, in which he gives a lecture. * The Gorilla Comics series Section Zero, written by Karl Kesel, featured a scientific genius named Titania \\"Doc\\" Challenger, implied to be Professor Challenger's descendant. * Cult Holmes: The Lost World: In this BBC 7 Cult Holmes story, Holmes is investigating the damage done by Challenger in bringing dinosaurs over from the plateau. Malone's account of events is referred to as if it had been the version of events in the BBC TV adaptation of The Lost World, rather than the novel. * In Los Sabios en Salamanca (The Sages in Salamanca), a Spanish short novel by Alberto L√≥pez Aroca, included in the book \\"Los Espectros Conjurados\\" (), Challenger and his friend Lord John Roxton meet Professor Abraham Van Helsing (from Bram Stoker's Dracula) in Salamanca, and attend a meeting of the Sociedad Herm√©tica Espa√±ola (a Spanish esoteric society). In the story also appear other characters, as H.P. Lovecraft's Randolph Carter, and Spanish writers Francisco de Quevedo and Diego de Torres Villarroel. * In the 1960 novel World of the Gods by Pel Torro (a pseudonym of Lionel Fanthorpe), a malevolent shapeshifting alien takes on the physical form of Professor Challenger, believing him to be a real-life Earth scientist, and is then forced to remain in this form for the rest of the novel. * The third book in the Iris Wildthyme series by Obverse Books, Miss Wildthyme and Friends Investigate, begins with a novella entitled The Found World by Jim Smith, a pseudo-sequel to The Lost World featuring Challenger, Dr. John H. Watson and Dracula, among others. * The third supplement for the Forgotten Futures role playing game is George E. Challenger's Mysterious World (1994), based on and including the Challenger novels and stories. * Professor William Rutherford, the real-life model for Challenger, is portrayed by actor John Sessions in one of the series of BBC Films titled Murder Rooms: The Dark Beginnings of Sherlock Holmes. The episode by Stephen Gallagher opens with the young Conan Doyle's attendance at a lantern slide lecture by famed explorer Everard im Thurn featuring the 'Lost World' plateau of Mount Roraima. The story goes on to hint at experiences that Doyle would later draw upon for the novel. *Professor Challenger is a major supporting character in the novel \\"Sherlock Holmes im Reich des Ctulhu\\" (Sherlock Holmes in the Realm of Ctulhu\\" by Klaus-Peter Walther and the audio play after that novel. Portrayals Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was the first person to portray Professor Challenger, dressing and making up as the professor for a photograph he wanted included in The Lost World's initial serialized publication in the Strand Magazine. The editor refused, feeling that such hoaxes were potentially damaging.

Those who accept the Mother in Heaven doctrine trace its origins to Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement. The doctrine became more widely known after Smith's death in 1844. The heavenly Mother doctrine is taught by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the Restoration Church of Jesus Christ,Role of women in the Restoration Church of Jesus Christ (On menu on right of website, click on \\"Core Beliefs\\" and then click on \\"The Role of Women\\") and branches of Mormon fundamentalism, such as the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. The doctrine is not generally recognized by other denominations within the Latter Day Saint movement, such as the Community of Christ, where trinitarianism is predominant. In the LDS Church, the doctrine of \\"heavenly Mother\\" or \\"heavenly parents\\" is not frequently discussed; however, the doctrine can be found in some church hymns and has been briefly discussed in church teaching manuals and sermons.\\"O My Father\\" (LDS hymn #292) refers to a mother in heaven. \\"Oh, What Songs of the Heart\\" (LDS hymn #286) refers to \\"heavenly parents\\", and \\"We Meet Again As Sisters\\" (LDS hymn #311) to \\"heav'nly parents\\". \\"The Family: A Proclamation to the World\\" mentions \\"heavenly parents\\". Various LDS Church curriculum materials refer to a heavenly Mother. E.g.: \\"Lesson 9: Chastity and Modesty\\", The Latter-day Saint Woman: Basic Manual for Women, Part A (2000); \\"Chapter 2: Our Heavenly Family\\", Gospel Principles, pp. 8‚Äì12 (2009); Spencer W. Kimball, \\"The True Way of Life and Salvation\\", Ensign, May 1978, p. 4.  Origin of the theology  The theological underpinnings of a belief in Heavenly Mother are attributed to Joseph Smith, who shortly before his death in 1844 outlined a controversial view of God that differed dramatically from traditional Christian consensus.See: King Follett Discourse, Smith 1844. Also: Smith's theology included the belief that God would share his glory with his children and that righteous couples might become exalted beings, or gods and goddesses, in the afterlife. Although there is no known record of Smith explicitly teaching about heavenly Mother, several of Smith's contemporaries attributed the theology to him either directly, or as a natural consequence of his theological stance. An editorial footnote of History of the Church 5:254, quotes Smith as saying: \\"Come to me; here's the mysteries man hath not seen, Here's our Father in heaven, and Mother, the Queen.\\" In addition, a secondhand account states that in 1839, Smith had told Zina Diantha Huntington, after the death of her mother, that \\"not only would she know her mother again on the other side, but 'more than that, you will meet and become acquainted with your eternal Mother, the wife of your Father in Heaven. In addition, members of the Anointed Quorum, a highly select leadership group in the early church that was privy to Smith's teachings, also acknowledged the existence of a Heavenly Mother.Orson Pratt 1876, p. 292; Wilford Woodruff 1875, pp. 31‚Äì32. The Times and Seasons published a letter to the editor from a pseudonymous person named \\"Joseph's Speckled Bird\\", in which the author stated that in the pre-Earth life, the spirit \\"was a child with his father and mother in heaven\\".Joseph's Speckled Bird 1845, p. 892. The apostle Parley Pratt even taught in an official church periodical that God may have had multiple wives before Christ's time, and that after the death of Mary (the mother of Jesus) she may have become another eternal wife. In 1845, after the death of Smith, the poet Eliza Roxcy Snow published a poem entitled \\"My Father in Heaven\\", (later titled \\"Invocation, or the Eternal Father and Mother\\", now used as the lyrics in the Latter-day Saint hymn \\"O My Father\\"), which acknowledged the existence of a heavenly Mother.Snow 1845. See also: ; . The poem contained the following language: Some early Mormons considered Snow to be a \\"prophetess\\". Later, church president Joseph F. Smith (a nephew of Joseph Smith) explained his own belief that \\"God revealed that principle that we have a mother as well as a father in heaven to Joseph Smith; Joseph Smith revealed it to Eliza Snow Smith, his wife; and Eliza Snow was inspired, being a poet, to put it into verse.\\" A companion hymn \\"Our Mother in Heaven\\" was published in the church's Juvenile Instructor four decades later. The doctrine is also attributed to several other early church leaders. According to one sermon by Brigham Young, Smith once said he \\"would not worship a God who had not a father; and I do not know that he would if he had not a mother; the one would be as absurd as the other.\\"Journal of Discourses, vol. 9, p. 286 = Multiple Heavenly Mothers = Polygamy has played an important part in Mormon history and multiple Mormon denominations have teachings on the existence of a polygamous Heavenly Father married to multiple Heavenly Mothers. Brigham Young taught that God the Father was polygamous, although teachings on Heavenly Mothers were never as popular and disappeared from official rhetoric after the end of LDS polygamy in 1904 (although existing polygynous marriages lasted into the 1950s). Top leaders used the examples of the polygamy of God the Father in defense of the practice and this teaching was widely accepted by the late-1850s. Apostle Orson Pratt taught in an official church periodical that \\"We have now clearly shown that God the Father had a plurality of wives,\\" and that after her death, Mary (the mother of Jesus) may have become another eternal polygamous wife of God. One scholar interpreted a 1976 LDS manual as alluding to this teaching. Author Carol Lynn Pearson stated that a seminary teacher from her youth fervently taught that there were multiple Heavenly Mothers. Another denomination, the Apostolic United Brethren, believes in multiple Mothers in Heaven.  Worship and prayer to Heavenly Mother  Orson Pratt, an early apostle of the LDS Church, opposed worshiping a heavenly Mother, because, he reasoned, like wives and children in any household, heavenly Mother was required to \\"yield the most perfect obedience to\\" her husband. Early leader George Q. Cannon thought that \\"there is too much of this inclination to deify 'our mother in heaven, arguing that she is not part of the Godhead and that to worship her would detract from the worship of heavenly Father. However, early 20th-century church leader Rudger Clawson disagreed, arguing that \\"it doesn't take away from our worship of the Eternal Father, to adore our Eternal Mother ... [W]e honor woman when we acknowledge Godhood in her eternal prototype.\\" Some church leaders have interpreted the term \\"God\\" to represent the divinely exalted couple with both a masculine and feminine half. Erastus Snow, an early Mormon apostle, wrote do you mean we should understand that Deity consists of a man and woman?' Most certainly I do. If I believe anything that God has ever said about himself ... I must believe that deity consists of a man and woman.\\" This notion was reaffirmed by later church leaders Hugh B. Brown, James E. Talmage, Melvin J. Ballard, and Bruce R. McConkie. Some Mormon feminists have adopted the practice of praying to the heavenly Mother. However, LDS Church president Gordon B. Hinckley opposed this practice, saying that Mormons should not pray to the heavenly Mother because Christ instructed his disciples to address the heavenly Father in their prayers. When a feminist professor was fired from Brigham Young University in the 1990s, it was revealed that one of the reasons was her public advocacy of praying to heavenly Mother. Other Mormon women have been excommunicated for similar publications such as teaching that Heavenly Mother is the Holy Ghost.  Acknowledgment by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints  One early authoritative statement from the entire First Presidency on the subject is the \\"origin of man\\" letter by the on the 50th anniversary of Charles Darwin's Origin of Species.Smith et al. 1909. The church also later implied the theology in the 1995 statement \\"The Family: A Proclamation to the World\\", where the church officially stated that each person is a \\"spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents\\". Other references to heavenly parents can be found in Latter-day Saint speeches and literature.E.g.: , encouraging Latter-day Saint women not to pray to the heavenly Mother, and M. Russell Ballard stating, \\"we are part of a divine plan designed by Heavenly Parents who love us\\" in his book When Thou Art Converted. In 2015, an official essay was published on the church website which surveyed 171 years of statements about a Mother in Heaven and confirmed that it is part of church doctrine. = Statements by church leaders = Various LDS Church leaders throughout the history of the church have spoken openly about the doctrine of a heavenly Mother. Brigham Young stated about Adam and Eve : \\"I tell you more, Adam is the father of our spirits ... [O]ur spirits and the spirits of all the heavenly family were begotten by Adam, and born of Eve. ... I tell you, when you see your Father in the Heavens, you will see Adam; when you see your Mother that bore your spirit, you will see Mother Eve.\\" (Since the LDS Church has formally denounced since the 1970s the Adam‚ÄìGod doctrine as taught by Young,Spencer W. Kimball, \\"Our Own Liahona,\\" Ensign, November 1976, p. 77. today this statement is doctrinal only to certain groups of Mormon fundamentalists.) Young also preached that resurrected \\"eternal mothers\\" would \\"be prepared to frame earths like unto ours\\". Susa Young Gates, a daughter of Young and a women's rights activist, stated that the \\"great Heavenly Mother was the great molder\\" of Abraham's personality. \\"Gates speculated that Heavenly Mother has played a significant role in all our lives, looking over us with 'watchful care' and providing 'careful training. Early 20th-century church leader B. H. Roberts pointed out that the heavenly Mother doctrine presents a \\"conception of the nobility of women and of motherhood and of wife- hood‚Äîplacing her side by side with the Divine Father.\\" Apostle John A. Widtsoe, a contemporary of Roberts, wrote that the afterlife \\"is given radiant warmth by the thought that ... [we have] a mother who possesses the attributes of Godhood.\\" In 1894, Juvenile Instructor, an official publication of the LDS Church, published a hymn entitled \\"Our Mother in Heaven\\".Juvenile Instructor, vol. 29, no. 8 (April 15, 1894): 263. A 1925 First Presidency statement included the lines \\"All men and women are in the similitude of the universal Father and Mother . ... [M]an, as a spirit, was begotten and born of heavenly parents . ... [and] is capable, by experience through ages and aeons, of evolving into a God.\\" There has also been some more recent discussion of heavenly Mother by LDS Church leaders. In a speech given at BYU in 2010, Glenn L. Pace, a member of the LDS Church's First Quorum of the Seventy, said, \\"Sisters, I testify that when you stand in front of your heavenly parents in those royal courts on high and look into Her eyes and behold Her countenance, any question you ever had about the role of women in the kingdom will evaporate into the rich celestial air, because at that moment you will see standing directly in front of you, your divine nature and destiny.\\"  Controversy  According to historian Linda Wilcox, heavenly Mother \\"is a shadowy and elusive belief floating around the edges of Mormon consciousness\\". The lack of focused teaching and more information about her has caused speculation among Mormons that this de-emphasis may have a divine purpose, such as to avoid drawing attention to her and to preserve the sacredness of her existence. In 1960, an LDS seminary teacher published in a Mormon encyclopedia that \\"the name of our Mother in Heaven has been withheld\\" because of the way God the Father's and Jesus Christ's names have been profaned.Melvin R. Brooks, LDS Reference Encyclopedia (Salt Lake City, Utah: Bookcraft, 1960), p. 309‚Äì10. Margaret Merrill Toscano writes that \\"[w]hile no General Authority has made an official statement denying belief in a Heavenly Mother nor stating that her existence is too sacred to discuss, several factors may influence the current trend that sees even a mention of Heavenly Mother as treading on forbidden ground. Members take their cues about what is acceptable doctrine from talks of General Authorities and official church manuals and magazines\\". These materials rarely mention heavenly Mother directly. The publicly discussed church discipline of feminists like Lynne Kanavel Whitesides, Maxine Hanks, Janice Merrill Allred, and Margaret Toscano, all of whom were disciplined in part for statements related to the heavenly Mother, may add to the general sense that discourse about her is strictly forbidden.Margaret Merrill Toscano, Is There a Place For Heavenly Mother In Mormon Theology; Sunstone; July 2004. However, Brigham Young University professor David L. Paulsen has argued that such a belief finds no official backing in statements by church leaders, and that the concept that the heavenly Mother is consigned to a \\"sacred silence\\" is largely the result of a relatively recent cultural perception. Though LDS Church president Gordon B. Hinckley has said the prohibition on praying to heavenly Mother in no way \\"belittles or denigrates her\\", some feel that it makes her seem less important than heavenly Father. Others assume that both heavenly parents are equally important and expect that more will be revealed when humanity is ready. Mormon fundamentalists believe that heavenly Father has multiple wives, and that although humankind shares the same heavenly Father, they do not all share the same heavenly Mother. The question of how heavenly Mother is regarded ties into a larger set of questions among many Mormons about power in relationships between men and women. When asked why God said that Adam would rule over Eve, Hinckley said, \\"I do not know ... My own interpretation of that sentence is that the husband shall have a governing responsibility to provide for, to protect, to strengthen and shield the wife. Any man who belittles or abuses or terrorizes, or who rules in unrighteousness, will deserve and, I believe, receive the reprimand of a just God who is the Eternal Father of both His sons and daughters.\\"  Reported visions  Heavenly Mother is absent in the visionary experiences in Mormon scriptures. The only recorded visionary experience is related by Zebedee Coltrin and recorded in the journal of Abraham H. Cannon.

Exercise physiology is the physiology of physical exercise. It is one of the allied health professions that involves the study of the acute responses and chronic adaptations to exercise. Understanding the effect of exercise involves studying specific changes in muscular, cardiovascular, and neurohumoral systems that lead to changes in functional capacity and strength due to endurance training or strength training. The effect of training on the body has been defined as the reaction to the adaptive responses of the body arising from exercise or as \\"an elevation of metabolism produced by exercise\\". Exercise physiologists study the effect of exercise on pathology, and the mechanisms by which exercise can reduce or reverse disease progression.  History  See also: Exercise ¬ß History; Aerobic exercise ¬ß History British physiologist Archibald Hill introduced the concepts of maximal oxygen uptake and oxygen debt in 1922. Hill and German physician Otto Meyerhof shared the 1922 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their independent work related to muscle energy metabolism. Building on this work, scientists began measuring oxygen consumption during exercise. Notable contributions were made by Henry Taylor at the University of Minnesota, Scandinavian scientists Per-Olof √Östrand and Bengt Saltin in the 1950s and 60s, the Harvard Fatigue Laboratory, German universities, and the Copenhagen Muscle Research Centre among others. In some countries it is a Primary Health Care Provider. Accredited Exercise Physiologists (AEP's) are university trained professionals who prescribe exercise based interventions to treat various conditions using specific dose response prescriptions specific to each individual.  Energy expenditure Humans have a high capacity to expend energy for many hours during sustained exertion. For example, one individual cycling at a speed of through over 50 consecutive days expended a total of 1,145 MJ (273,850 kcal; 273,850 dieter calories) with an average power output of 182.5 W.. This individual while exceptional was not physiologically extraordinary since he was described as \\"subelite\\" due to his not being \\"able to adjust power output to regulate energy expenditure as occurs with elite athletes during ultra-cycling events\\" page 347. Skeletal muscle burns 90 mg (0.5 mmol) of glucose each minute during continuous activity (such as when repetitively extending the human knee), generating ‚âà24 W of mechanical energy, and since muscle energy conversion is only 22‚Äì26% efficient, ‚âà76 W of heat energy. Resting skeletal muscle has a basal metabolic rate (resting energy consumption) of 0.63 W/kgElia, M. (1992) \\"Energy expenditure in the whole body\\". Energy metabolism. Tissue determinants and cellular corollaries. 61‚Äì79 Raven Press New York. making a 160 fold difference between the energy consumption of inactive and active muscles. For short duration muscular exertion, energy expenditure can be far greater: an adult human male when jumping up from a squat can mechanically generate 314 W/kg. Such rapid movement can generate twice this amount in nonhuman animals such as bonobos, and in some small lizards. This energy expenditure is very large compared to the basal resting metabolic rate of the adult human body. This rate varies somewhat with size, gender and age but is typically between 45 W and 85 W. Henry 2005 provides BMR formula various ages given body weight: those for BMR aged 18‚Äì30 in MJ/day (where mass is body weight in kg) are: male BMR = 0.0669 mass + 2.28; females BMR = 0.0546 mass + 2.33; 1 MJ per day = 11.6 W. The data providing these formula hide a high variance: for men weighing 70 kg, measured BMR is between 50 and 110 W, and women weighing 60 kg, between 40 W and 90 W. Total energy expenditure (TEE) due to muscular expended energy is much higher and depends upon the average level of physical work and exercise done during a day. Thus exercise, particularly if sustained for very long periods, dominates the energy metabolism of the body. Physical activity energy expenditure correlates strongly with the gender, age, weight, heart rate, and VO2 max of an individual, during physical activity.  Metabolic changes  Ergospirometry laboratory for the measurement of metabolic changes during a graded exercise test on a treadmill = Rapid energy sources = Energy needed to perform short lasting, high intensity bursts of activity is derived from anaerobic metabolism within the cytosol of muscle cells, as opposed to aerobic respiration which utilizes oxygen, is sustainable, and occurs in the mitochondria. The quick energy sources consist of the phosphocreatine (PCr) system, fast glycolysis, and adenylate kinase. All of these systems re-synthesize adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the universal energy source in all cells. The most rapid source, but the most readily depleted of the above sources is the PCr system which utilizes the enzyme creatine kinase. This enzyme catalyzes a reaction that combines phosphocreatine and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) into ATP and creatine. This resource is short lasting because oxygen is required for the resynthesis of phosphocreatine via mitochondrial creatine kinase. Therefore, under anaerobic conditions, this substrate is finite and only lasts between approximately 10 to 30 seconds of high intensity work. Fast glycolysis, however, can function for approximately 2 minutes prior to fatigue, and predominately uses intracellular glycogen as a substrate. Glycogen is broken down rapidly via glycogen phosphorylase into individual glucose units during intense exercise. Glucose is then oxidized to pyruvate and under anaerobic conditions is reduced to lactic acid. This reaction oxidizes NADH to NAD, thereby releasing a hydrogen ion, promoting acidosis. For this reason, fast glycolysis can not be sustained for long periods of time. = Plasma glucose = Plasma glucose is said to be maintained when there is an equal rate of glucose appearance (entry into the blood) and glucose disposal (removal from the blood). In the healthy individual, the rates of appearance and disposal are essentially equal during exercise of moderate intensity and duration; however, prolonged exercise or sufficiently intense exercise can result in an imbalance leaning towards a higher rate of disposal than appearance, at which point glucose levels fall producing the onset of fatigue. Rate of glucose appearance is dictated by the amount of glucose being absorbed at the gut as well as liver (hepatic) glucose output. Although glucose absorption from the gut is not typically a source of glucose appearance during exercise, the liver is capable of catabolizing stored glycogen (glycogenolysis) as well as synthesizing new glucose from specific reduced carbon molecules (glycerol, pyruvate, and lactate) in a process called gluconeogenesis. The ability of the liver to release glucose into the blood from glycogenolysis is unique, since skeletal muscle, the other major glycogen reservoir, is incapable of doing so. Unlike skeletal muscle, liver cells contain the enzyme glycogen phosphatase, which removes a phosphate group from glucose-6-P to release free glucose. In order for glucose to exit a cell membrane, the removal of this phosphate group is essential. Although gluconeogenesis is an important component of hepatic glucose output, it alone can not sustain exercise. For this reason, when glycogen stores are depleted during exercise, glucose levels fall and fatigue sets in. Glucose disposal, the other side of the equation, is controlled by uptake of glucose at the working skeletal muscles. During exercise, despite decreased insulin concentrations, muscle increases GLUT4 translocation of and glucose uptake. The mechanism for increased GLUT4 translocation is an area of ongoing research. glucose control: As mentioned above, insulin secretion is reduced during exercise, and does not play a major role in maintaining normal blood glucose concentration during exercise, but its counter-regulatory hormones appear in increasing concentrations. Principle among these are glucagon, epinephrine, and growth hormone. All of these hormones stimulate liver (hepatic) glucose output, among other functions. For instance, both epinephrine and growth hormone also stimulate adipocyte lipase, which increases non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) release. By oxidizing fatty acids, this spares glucose utilization and helps to maintain blood sugar level during exercise. Exercise for diabetes: Exercise is a particularly potent tool for glucose control in those who have diabetes mellitus. In a situation of elevated blood glucose (hyperglycemia), moderate exercise can induce greater glucose disposal than appearance, thereby decreasing total plasma glucose concentrations. As stated above, the mechanism for this glucose disposal is independent of insulin, which makes it particularly well-suited for people with diabetes. In addition, there appears to be an increase in sensitivity to insulin for approximately 12‚Äì24 hours post-exercise. This is particularly useful for those who have type II diabetes and are producing sufficient insulin but demonstrate peripheral resistance to insulin signaling. However, during extreme hyperglycemic episodes, people with diabetes should avoid exercise due to potential complications associated with ketoacidosis. Exercise could exacerbate ketoacidosis by increasing ketone synthesis in response to increased circulating NEFA's. Type II diabetes is also intricately linked to obesity, and there may be a connection between type II diabetes and how fat is stored within pancreatic, muscle, and liver cells. Likely due to this connection, weight loss from both exercise and diet tends to increase insulin sensitivity in the majority of people. In some people, this effect can be particularly potent and can result in normal glucose control. Although nobody is technically cured of diabetes, individuals can live normal lives without the fear of diabetic complications; however, regain of weight would assuredly result in diabetes signs and symptoms. = Oxygen = Vigorous physical activity (such as exercise or hard labor) increases the body's demand for oxygen. The first-line physiologic response to this demand is an increase in heart rate, breathing rate, and depth of breathing. Oxygen consumption (VO2) during exercise is best described by the Fick Equation: VO2=Q x (a-vO2diff), which states that the amount of oxygen consumed is equal to cardiac output (Q) multiplied by the difference between arterial and venous oxygen concentrations. More simply put, oxygen consumption is dictated by the quantity of blood distributed by the heart as well as the working muscle's ability to take up the oxygen within that blood; however, this is a bit of an oversimplification. Although cardiac output is thought to be the limiting factor of this relationship in healthy individuals, it is not the only determinant of VO2 max. That is, factors such as the ability of the lung to oxygenate the blood must also be considered. Various pathologies and anomalies cause conditions such as diffusion limitation, ventilation/perfusion mismatch, and pulmonary shunts that can limit oxygenation of the blood and therefore oxygen distribution. In addition, the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood is also an important determinant of the equation. Oxygen carrying capacity is often the target of exercise (ergogenic aids) aids used in endurance sports to increase the volume percentage of red blood cells (hematocrit), such as through blood doping or the use of erythropoietin (EPO). Furthermore, peripheral oxygen uptake is reliant on a rerouting of blood flow from relatively inactive viscera to the working skeletal muscles, and within the skeletal muscle, capillary to muscle fiber ratio influences oxygen extraction. = Dehydration = Dehydration refers both to hypohydration (dehydration induced prior to exercise) and to exercise-induced dehydration (dehydration that develops during exercise). The latter reduces aerobic endurance performance and results in increased body temperature, heart rate, perceived exertion, and possibly increased reliance on carbohydrate as a fuel source. Although the negative effects of exercise-induced dehydration on exercise performance were clearly demonstrated in the 1940s, athletes continued to believe for years thereafter that fluid intake was not beneficial. More recently, negative effects on performance have been demonstrated with modest (<2%) dehydration, and these effects are exacerbated when the exercise is performed in a hot environment. The effects of hypohydration may vary, depending on whether it is induced through diuretics or sauna exposure, which substantially reduce plasma volume, or prior exercise, which has much less impact on plasma volume. Hypohydration reduces aerobic endurance, but its effects on muscle strength and endurance are not consistent and require further study. Intense prolonged exercise produces metabolic waste heat, and this is removed by sweat-based thermoregulation. A male marathon runner loses each hour around 0.83 L in cool weather and 1.2 L in warm (losses in females are about 68 to 73% lower). People doing heavy exercise may lose two and half times as much fluid in sweat as urine. This can have profound physiological effects. Cycling for 2 hours in the heat (35 ¬∞C) with minimal fluid intake causes body mass decline by 3 to 5%, blood volume likewise by 3 to 6%, body temperature to rise constantly, and in comparison with proper fluid intake, higher heart rates, lower stroke volumes and cardiac outputs, reduced skin blood flow, and higher systemic vascular resistance. These effects are largely eliminated by replacing 50 to 80% of the fluid lost in sweat. = Other = * Plasma catecholamine concentrations increase 10-fold in whole body exercise. * Ammonia is produced by exercised skeletal muscles from ADP (the precursor of ATP) by purine nucleotide deamination and amino acid catabolism of myofibrils. * interleukin-6 (IL-6) increases in blood circulation due to its release from working skeletal muscles. This release is reduced if glucose is taken, suggesting it is related to energy depletion stresses. * Sodium absorption is affected by the release of interleukin-6 as this can cause the secretion of arginine vasopressin which, in turn, can lead to exercise-associated dangerously low sodium levels (hyponatremia). This loss of sodium in blood plasma can result in swelling of the brain. This can be prevented by awareness of the risk of drinking excessive amounts of fluids during prolonged exercise.  Brain  At rest, the human brain receives 15% of total cardiac output, and uses 20% of the body's energy consumption. The brain is normally dependent for its high energy expenditure upon aerobic metabolism. The brain as a result is highly sensitive to failure of its oxygen supply with loss of consciousness occurring within six to seven seconds, with its EEG going flat in 23 seconds. Therefore, the brain's function would be disrupted if exercise affected its supply of oxygen and glucose. Protecting the brain from even minor disruption is important since exercise depends upon motor control. Because humans are bipeds, motor control is needed for keeping balance. For this reason, brain energy consumption is increased during intense physical exercise due to the demands in the motor cognition needed to control the body. Exercise Physiologists treat a range of neurological conditions including (but not limited to): Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, Traumatic Brain Injury, Spinal Chord Injury, Cerebral Palsy and mental health conditions. = Cerebral oxygen = Cerebral autoregulation usually ensures the brain has priority to cardiac output, though this is impaired slightly by exhaustive exercise. During submaximal exercise, cardiac output increases and cerebral blood flow increases beyond the brain's oxygen needs. However, this is not the case for continuous maximal exertion: \\"Maximal exercise is, despite the increase in capillary oxygenation [in the brain], associated with a reduced mitochondrial O2 content during whole body exercise\\" page 309 The autoregulation of the brain's blood supply is impaired particularly in warm environments = Glucose = In adults, exercise depletes the plasma glucose available to the brain: short intense exercise (35 min ergometer cycling) can reduce brain glucose uptake by 32%. At rest, energy for the adult brain is normally provided by glucose but the brain has a compensatory capacity to replace some of this with lactate. Research suggests that this can be raised, when a person rests in a brain scanner, to about 17%, with a higher percentage of 25% occurring during hypoglycemia. During intense exercise, lactate has been estimated to provide a third of the brain's energy needs. There is evidence that the brain might, however, in spite of these alternative sources of energy, still suffer an energy crisis since IL-6 (a sign of metabolic stress) is released during exercise from the brain. = Hyperthermia = Humans use sweat thermoregulation for body heat removal, particularly to remove the heat produced during exercise. Moderate dehydration as a consequence of exercise and heat is reported to impair cognition. These impairments can start after body mass lost that is greater than 1%. Cognitive impairment, particularly due to heat and exercise is likely to be due to loss of integrity to the blood brain barrier. Hyperthermia also can lower cerebral blood flow, and raise brain temperature.  Fatigue  = Intense activity = Researchers once attributed fatigue to a build-up of lactic acid in muscles. However, this is no longer believed. Rather, lactate may stop muscle fatigue by keeping muscles fully responding to nerve signals. The available oxygen and energy supply, and disturbances of muscle ion homeostasis are the main factor determining exercise performance, at least during brief very intense exercise. Each muscle contraction involves an action potential that activates voltage sensors, and so releases Ca2+ ions from the muscle fibre‚Äôs sarcoplasmic reticulum. The action potentials that cause this also require ion changes: Na influxes during the depolarization phase and K effluxes for the repolarization phase. Cl‚àí ions also diffuse into the sarcoplasm to aid the repolarization phase. During intense muscle contraction, the ion pumps that maintain homeostasis of these ions are inactivated and this (with other ion related disruption) causes ionic disturbances. This causes cellular membrane depolarization, inexcitability, and so muscle weakness. Ca2+ leakage from type 1 ryanodine receptor) channels has also been identified with fatigue. Dorando Pietri about to collapse at the Marathon finish at the 1908 London Olympic Games = Endurance failure = After intense prolonged exercise, there can be a collapse in body homeostasis. Some famous examples include: * Dorando Pietri in the 1908 Summer Olympic men's marathon ran the wrong way and collapsed several times. * Jim Peters in the marathon of the 1954 Commonwealth Games staggered and collapsed several times, and though he had a five-kilometre (three-mile) lead, failed to finish. Though it was formerly believed that this was due to severe dehydration, more recent research suggests it was the combined effects upon the brain of hyperthermia, hypertonic hypernatraemia associated with dehydration, and possibly hypoglycaemia. * Gabriela Andersen-Schiess in the woman's marathon at the Los Angeles 1984 Summer Olympics in the race's final 400 meters, stopping occasionally and shown signs of heat exhaustion. Though she fell across the finish line, she was released from medical care only two hours later. = Central governor = Tim Noakes, based on an earlier idea by the 1922 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine winner Archibald Hill has proposed the existence of a central governor. In this, the brain continuously adjusts the power output by muscles during exercise in regard to a safe level of exertion. These neural calculations factor in prior length of strenuous exercise, the planned duration of further exertion, and the present metabolic state of the body. This adjusts the number of activated skeletal muscle motor units, and is subjectively experienced as fatigue and exhaustion. The idea of a central governor rejects the earlier idea that fatigue is only caused by mechanical failure of the exercising muscles (\\"peripheral fatigue\\"). Instead, the brain models the metabolic limits of the body to ensure that whole body homeostasis is protected, in particular that the heart is guarded from hypoxia, and an emergency reserve is always maintained. The idea of the central governor has been questioned since ‚Äòphysiological catastrophes‚Äô can and do occur suggesting that if it did exist, athletes (such as Dorando Pietri, Jim Peters and Gabriela Andersen-Schiess) can override it. = Other factors = Exercise fatigue has also been suggested to be affected by: * brain hyperthermia * glycogen depletion in brain cells * reactive oxygen species impairing skeletal muscle function * reduced level of glutamate secondary to uptake of ammonia in the brain * Fatigue in diaphragm and abdominal respiratory muscles limiting breathing * Impaired oxygen supply to muscles * Ammonia effects upon the brain * Serotonin pathways in the brain  Cardiac biomarkers  Prolonged exercise such as marathons can increase cardiac biomarkers such as troponin, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and ischemia-modified (aka MI) albumin. This can be misinterpreted by medical personnel as signs of myocardial infarction, or cardiac dysfunction. In these clinical conditions, such cardiac biomarkers are produced by irreversible injury of muscles. In contrast, the processes that create them after strenuous exertion in endurance sports are reversible, with their levels returning to normal within 24-hours (further research, however, is still needed).The Lab Says Heart Attack, but the Patient Is Fine The New York Times, 27 November 2008  Human adaptations  Humans are specifically adapted to engage in prolonged strenuous muscular activity (such as efficient long distance bipedal running). This capacity for endurance running may have evolved to allow the running down of game animals by persistent slow but constant chase over many hours. Central to the success of this is the ability of the human body, unlike that of the animals they hunt, to effectively remove muscle heat waste. In most animals, this is stored by allowing a temporary increase in body temperature. This allows them to escape from animals that quickly speed after them for a short duration (the way nearly all predators catch their prey). Humans, unlike other animals that catch prey, remove heat with a specialized thermoregulation based on sweat evaporation. One gram of sweat can remove 2,598 J of heat energy. Another mechanism is increased skin blood flow during exercise that allows for greater convective heat loss that is aided by our upright posture. This skin based cooling has resulted in humans acquiring an increased number of sweat glands, combined with a lack of body fur that would otherwise stop air circulation and efficient evaporation. Because humans can remove exercise heat, they can avoid the fatigue from heat exhaustion that affects animals chased in a persistent manner, and so eventually catch them.  Selective breeding experiments with rodents  Rodents have been specifically bred for exercise behavior or performance in several different studies. For example, laboratory rats have been bred for high or low performance on a motorized treadmill with electrical stimulation as motivation. The high-performance line of rats also exhibits increased voluntary wheel-running behavior as compared with the low-capacity line. In an experimental evolution approach, four replicate lines of laboratory mice have been bred for high levels of voluntary exercise on wheels, while four additional control lines are maintained by breeding without regard to the amount of wheel running. These selected lines of mice also show increased endurance capacity in tests of forced endurance capacity on a motorized treadmill. However, in neither selection experiment have the precise causes of fatigue during either forced or voluntary exercise been determined.  Exercise-induced muscle pain  Physical exercise may cause pain both as an immediate effect that may result from stimulation of free nerve endings by low pH, as well as a delayed onset muscle soreness. The delayed soreness is fundamentally the result of ruptures within the muscle, although apparently not involving the rupture of whole muscle fibers. Muscle pain can range from a mild soreness to a debilitating injury depending on intensity of exercise, level of training, and other factors. There is some preliminary evidence to suggest that moderate intensity continuous training has the ability to increase someone's pain threshold. Education in exercise physiology Accreditation programs exist with professional bodies in most developed countries, ensuring the quality and consistency of education. In Canada, one may obtain the professional certification title ‚Äì Certified Exercise Physiologist for those working with clients (both clinical and non clinical) in the health and fitness industry. In Australia, one may obtain the professional certification title - Accredited Exercise Physiologist (AEP) through the professional body Exercise and Sports Science Australia (ESSA). In Australia, it is common for an AEP to also have the qualification of an Accredited Exercise Scientist (AES). The premiere governing body is the American College of Sports Medicine. An exercise physiologist's area of study may include but is not limited to biochemistry, bioenergetics, cardiopulmonary function, hematology, biomechanics, skeletal muscle physiology, neuroendocrine function, and central and peripheral nervous system function. Furthermore, exercise physiologists range from basic scientists, to clinical researchers, to clinicians, to sports trainers. Colleges and universities offer exercise physiology as a program of study on various different levels, including undergraduate, graduate degrees and certificates, and doctoral programs. The basis of Exercise Physiology as a major is to prepare students for a career in field of health sciences. A program that focuses on the scientific study of the physiological processes involved in physical or motor activity, including sensorimotor interactions, response mechanisms, and the effects of injury, disease, and disability. Includes instruction in muscular and skeletal anatomy; molecular and cellular basis of muscle contraction; fuel utilization; neurophysiology of motor mechanics; systemic physiological responses (respiration, blood flow, endocrine secretions, and others); fatigue and exhaustion; muscle and body training; physiology of specific exercises and activities; physiology of injury; and the effects of disabilities and disease. Careers available with a degree in Exercise Physiology can include: non- clinical, client-based work; strength and conditioning specialists; cardiopulmonary treatment; and clinical-based research. In order to gauge the multiple areas of study, students are taught processes in which to follow on a client-based level. Practical and lecture teachings are instructed in the classroom and in a laboratory setting. These include: *Health and risk assessment: In order to safely work with a client on the job, you must first be able to know the benefits and risks associated with physical activity. Examples of this include knowing specific injuries the body can experience during exercise, how to properly screen a client before their training begins, and what factors to look for that may inhibit their performance. *Exercise testing: Coordinating exercise tests in order to measure body compositions, cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength/endurance, and flexibility. Functional tests are also used in order to gain understanding on a more specific part of the body. Once the information is gathered about a client, exercise physiologists must also be able to interpret the test data and decide what health-related outcomes have been discovered. *Exercise prescription: Forming training programs that best meet an individuals health and fitness goals. Must be able to take into account different types of exercises, the reasons/goal for a clients workout, and pre-screened assessments.

History Breed Street Shul, 2008 Boyle Heights was called (\\"White Bluff\\") when Alta California was part of the First Mexican Republic. The area is named after Andrew Boyle, an Irishman born in Ballinrobe Co.Mayo in 1818 who purchased on the bluffs overlooking the Los Angeles River after fighting in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. From 1889 through 1909 the city was divided into nine wards. In 1899 a motion was introduced at the Ninth Ward Development Association to use the name Boyle Heights was extended to apply to all the highlands of the Ninth Ward, including Brooklyn Heights and Euclid Heights. The Japanese community of Little Tokyo continued to grow and extended to the First Street Corridor into Boyle Heights in the early 1910s. Boyle Heights became Los Angeles‚Äôs largest residential communities of Japanese immigrants and Americans, apart from Little Tokyo. In the early 1910s, Boyle Heights was one of the only communities that did not have restricted housing covenants that discriminated against Japanese and other people of color. In the 1920s and 1930s, Boyle Heights became the center of significant churches, temples, and schools for the Japanese community. .These include the Tenrikyo Junior Church of America, the Konko Church, and the Higashi Honganji Buddhist Temple; all designed by Yos Hirose. The Japanese Baptist Church was built by the Los Angeles City Baptist Missionary Society. A hospital, also designed by Hirose, opened in 1929 to serve the Japanese American community. By the 1920s through the 1960s, Boyle Heights was racially and ethnically diverse as a center of Jewish, Mexican and Japanese immigrant life in the early 20th century, and also hosted large Yugoslav, Armenian and Russian populations. Bruce Phillips, a sociologist who tracked Jewish communities across the United States, said that Jewish families left Boyle Heights not because of racism, but instead because of banks redlining the neighborhood (denying home loans) and the construction of several freeways through the community, which led to the loss of many houses. In 2017, some residents were protesting gentrification of their neighborhood by the influx of new businesses, a theme found in the TV series Vida, set in the neighborhood. Demographics Mariachi Plaza station, 2009, one of two underground stations in Boyle Heights As of the 2000 census, there were 92,785 people in the neighborhood, which was considered \\"not especially diverse\\" ethnically, Diversity \\"measures the probability that any two residents, chosen at random, would be of different ethnicities. If all residents are of the same ethnic group it's zero. If half are from one group and half from another it's .50.\\" ‚ÄîLos Angeles Times with the racial composition of the neighborhood at 94.0% Latino, 2.3% Asian, 2.0% White (non- Hispanic), 0.9% African American, and 0.8% other races. The median household income was $33,235, low in comparison to the rest of the city. The neighborhood's population was also one of the youngest in the city, with a median age of just 25. As of 2011, 95% of the community was Hispanic and Latino. The community had Mexican Americans, Mexican immigrants, and Central American ethnic residents.

Boyle Heights was a predominantly Jewish community with \\"a vibrant, pre-World War II, Yiddish- speaking community, replete with small shops along Brooklyn Avenue, union halls, synagogues and hyperactive politics ... shaped by the enduring influence of the Socialist and Communist parties\\" before Boyle Heights became predominantly associated with Mexicans/Mexican Americans. The rise of the socialist and communist parties increased the people's involvement in politics in the community because the \\"liberal-left exercised great influence in the immigrant community\\". Even with an ever-growing diversity in Boyle Heights, \\"Jews remained culturally and politically dominant after World War II\\". Nevertheless, as the Jewish community was moving westward into new homes, the largest growing group, Latinos, was moving into Boyle Heights because to them this neighborhood was represented as upward mobility. With Jews and Latinos both in Boyle Heights, these men, part of the Jewish Community Relations Council (JCRC) ‚Äî Louis Levy, Ben Solnit, Pinkhas Karl, Harry Sheer, and Julius Levitt ‚Äî helped to empower the Latinos who either lived among the Jewish people or who worked together in the factories. The combination of Jewish people and Latinos in Boyle Heights symbolized a tight unity between the two communities. The two groups helped to elect Edward R. Roybal to the City Council over Councilman Christensen; with the help from the Community Service Organization (CSO). In order for Roybal to win a landslide victory over Christensen, \\"the JCRC, with representation from business and labor leaders, associated with both Jewish left traditions, had become the prime financial benefactor to CSO .. labor historically backed incumbents ... [and] the Cold War struggle for the hearts and minds of minority workers also influenced the larger political dynamic\\". CASA 0101 Theater, 2014 In the 1947 election, Edward Roybal lost, but Jewish community activist Saul Alinsky and the Industrial Areas Foundation (IAF) garnered support from Mexican Americans to bring Roybal to victory two years later 1949.The Community Service Organization (CSO) helped Roybal win the election and to increase the multi- racial involvement in Boyle Heights.(Bernstein, 243) When Roybal took office as city councilman in 1949, he experienced racism when trying to buy a home for his family. The real-estate agent told him that he could not sell to Mexicans, and Roybal's first act as councilman was to protest racial discrimination and to create a community that represented inter-racial politics in Boyle Heights.(Bernstein, 224). This Latino-Jewish relationship shaped politics in that when Antonio Villaraigosa became mayor of Los Angeles in 2005, \\"not only did he have ties to Boyle Heights, but he was elected by replicating the labor-based, multicultural coalition that Congressman Edward Roybal assembled in 1949 to become Los Angeles's first city council member of Latino heritage\\". Further, the Vladeck Center (named after Borukh Charney Vladeck) contributed to the community of Boyle Heights in a big way because it was not just a building, it was \\"a venue for a wide range of activities that promoted Jewish culture and politics\\".  East LA Interchange  In 1961, the construction of the East LA Interchange began. At 135 acres in size, the interchange is three times larger than the average highway system, even expanding at some points to 27 lanes in width. Also known as the Spaghetti Bowl, the enormity of the structure and the complexity of its many routes called for a $17,000 blueprint model of the highway long before construction even began. During its construction, engineers built 32 bridges and 20 walls, excavated 1,500,000 yards of earth, laid 23,545 feet of concrete pipe, and used 4,200,000 yards of structural steel and 13,200,000 pounds of reinforced steel to complete the busiest freeway interchange in the world. The interchange handles around 1.7 million vehicles daily and has produced one of the most traffic congested regions in the world as well as one of the most concentrated pockets of air pollution in America. Since the 1920s, both elite and working-class communities throughout Southern California have witnessed the enforcement of highly effective racial covenants and other exclusionary measures that aim to distinguish separate white and non-white neighborhoods. By the 1960s, the federal government declared certain areas as ‚ÄúWhite Group Zones‚Äù which forced any non-whites in those areas out of their homes. This resulted in the development of Boyle Heights, a multicultural, interethnic neighborhood in East Los Angeles whose celebration of cultural difference has made it a role model for democracy. Since the establishment of multicultural neighborhoods like Boyle Heights was a byproduct of the gentrification of minorities into separate urban area homelands, people in these interracial communities have become considered ‚Äúdisposable people‚Äù who are desirable targets for gentrification. Education Just 5% of Boyle Heights residents aged 25 and older had earned a four-year degree by 2000, a low percentage for the city and the county. The percentage of residents in that age range who had not earned a high school diploma was high for the county. =Schools= Francisco Bravo Medical Magnet High School, 2011 Roosevelt High School.

Oakley developed hunting skills as a child to provide for her impoverished family in western Ohio. At 15 she won a shooting contest against experienced marksman Frank E. Butler, whom she later married. The pair joined Buffalo Bill in 1885, performing in Europe before royalty and other heads of state. Audiences were astounded to see her shooting out a cigar from her husband's lips or splitting a playing-card edge-on at 30 paces, and she earned more than anyone except Buffalo Bill himself. After a bad rail accident in 1901, she had to settle for a less-taxing routine, and toured in a play written about her career, as well as instructing women in marksmanship, believing strongly in female self- defense. Her stage acts were filmed for one of Thomas Edison's earliest Kinetoscopes in 1894. Since her death, her story has been adapted for stage musicals and films, including Annie Get Your Gun. Early life Annie Oakley was born Phoebe Ann (Annie) Mosey on August 13, 1860, in a log cabin less than northwest of Woodland, now Willowdell, in Darke County, Ohio, a rural county along the state's border with Indiana. Her birthplace is about east of North Star. There is a stone-mounted plaque in the vicinity of the site, which was placed by the Annie Oakley Committee in 1981, 121 years after her birth. Annie's parents were Quakers of English descent from Hollidaysburg, Blair County, Pennsylvania: Susan Wise, age 18, and Jacob Mosey, born 1799, age 49, married in 1848. They moved to a rented farm (later purchased with a mortgage) in Patterson Township, Darke County, Ohio, sometime around 1855. Born in 1860, Annie was the sixth of Jacob and Susan's nine children, and the fifth of the seven surviving. Her siblings were Mary Jane (1851‚Äì1867), Lydia (1852‚Äì1882), Elizabeth (1855‚Äì1881), Sarah Ellen (1857‚Äì1939), Catherine (1859‚Äì1859), John (1861‚Äì1949), Hulda (1864‚Äì1934) and a stillborn infant brother in 1865. Annie's father, who had fought in the War of 1812, became an invalid from hypothermia during a blizzard in late 1865 and died of pneumonia in early 1866 at age 66. Her mother later married Daniel Brumbaugh, had one more child, Emily (1868‚Äì1937), and was widowed for a second time. Because of poverty following her father's death, Annie did not regularly attend school as a child, although she did attend later in childhood and in adulthood. On March 15, 1870, at age nine, she was admitted to the Darke County Infirmary along with her sister Sarah Ellen. According to her autobiography, she was put in the care of the infirmary's superintendent, Samuel Crawford Edington, and his wife Nancy, who taught her to sew and decorate. Beginning in the spring of 1870, she was \\"bound out\\" to a local family to help care for their infant son, on the false promise of fifty cents per week () and an education. The couple had originally wanted someone who could pump water, cook, and who was bigger. She spent about two years in near slavery to them, enduring mental and physical abuse. One time, the wife put Annie out in the freezing cold without shoes, as a punishment because she had fallen asleep over some darning. Annie referred to them as \\"the wolves\\". Even in her autobiography, she never revealed the couple's real names. According to biographer Glenda Riley, \\"the wolves\\" could have been the Studabaker family, but the 1870 U.S. Census suggests they were the Abram Boose family of neighboring Preble County. Around the spring of 1872, Annie ran away from \\"the wolves\\". According to biographer Shirl Kasper, it was only at this point that Annie met and lived with the Edingtons, returning to her mother's home around the age of 15. Annie began trapping before the age of seven, and shooting and hunting by age eight, to support her siblings and her widowed mother. She sold the hunted game to locals in Greenville, such as shopkeepers Charles and G. Anthony Katzenberger, who shipped it to hotels in Cincinnati and other cities. She also sold the game to restaurants and hotels in northern Ohio. Her skill paid off the mortgage on her mother's farm when Annie was 15. Debut and marriage The Amateur Circus at Nutley (1894) by American illustrator Peter Newell. The scene depicted in the center is of Annie Oakley, standing on horseback, demonstrating her shooting ability. Annie soon became well known throughout the region. On Thanksgiving Day 1875, the Baughman & Butler shooting act was being performed in Cincinnati. Traveling show marksman and former dog trainer Frank E. Butler (1847‚Äì1926), an Irish immigrant, placed a $100 bet per side () with Cincinnati hotel owner Jack Frost that Butler could beat any local fancy shooter.Longford Genealogy, Retrieved October 8, 2014. The hotelier arranged a shooting match between Butler and the 15-year-old Annie, saying, \\"The last opponent Butler expected was a 15-year-old girl named Annie.\\" After missing on his 25th shot, Butler lost the match and the bet. Another account says that Butler hit on his last shot, but the bird fell dead about beyond the boundary line. He soon began courting Annie and they married. They did not have children. According to a modern-day account in The Cincinnati Enquirer, it is possible that the shooting match may have taken place in 1881 and not 1875. It appears the time of the event was never recorded. Biographer Shirl Kasper states the shooting match took place in the spring of 1881 near Greenville, possibly in North Star as mentioned by Butler during interviews in 1903 and 1924. Other sources seem to coincide with the North Fairmount location near Cincinnati if the event occurred in 1881. The Annie Oakley Center Foundation mentions Oakley visiting her married sister Lydia Stein at her home near Cincinnati in 1875.Annie Oakley Center Foundation, Retrieved October 2, 2014. That information is incorrect as Lydia didn't marry Joseph C. Stein until March 19, 1877.FamilySearch, Retrieved October 2, 2014. Although speculation, it is most likely that Oakley and her mother visited Lydia in 1881 as she was seriously ill from tuberculosis.Geni, Retrieved April 24, 2018. The Bevis House hotel was still being operated by Martin Bevis and W. H. Ridenour in 1875. It opened around 1860 after the building was previously used as a pork packaging facility. Jack Frost didn't obtain management of the hotel until 1879. The Baughman & Butler shooting act first appeared on the pages of The Cincinnati Enquirer in 1880. They signed with Sells Brothers Circus in 1881 and made an appearance at the Coliseum Opera House later that year. Regardless of the actual date of the shooting match, Oakley and Butler were married a year afterward. A certificate on file with the Archives of Ontario, Registration Number 49594, reports that Butler and Oakley were wed on June 20, 1882, in Windsor, Ontario. \\"Sitting Bull was deeply moved by Annie's talent. He thought her ability with a gun was amazing.\\"Archives of Ontario via Ancestry.com (Ontario, Canada, Marriages 1801-1928), Retrieved on October 1, 2014. Many sources say the marriage took place on August 23, 1876, in Cincinnati, but no recorded certificate validates that date. A possible reason for the contradictory dates is that Butler's divorce from his first wife, Henrietta Saunders, was not yet final in 1876.

Throughout Oakley's show-business career, the public was often led to believe that she was five to six years younger than she was. The later marriage date would have better supported her fictional age. Career and touring Annie and Frank Butler lived in Cincinnati for a time. Oakley, the stage name she adopted when she and Frank began performing together, (the answer is no: \\"Her mother, Susan, named her Phoebe Ann‚Ä¶\\"; her father Jacob is surnamed \\"Mosey\\" in the National Archives War of 1812 military records; \\"In the 1870 Census, Annie is listed as Ann Mosey\\" ‚Äì but, several other surname spellings appeared later. \\"The professional name Oakley was assumed in 1882, when Annie began to perform with Frank Butler; ‚Ä¶\\") is believed to have been taken from the city's neighborhood of Oakley, where they resided. Some people believe she took on the name because that was the name of the man who had paid her train fare when she was a child. Oakley c. 1899 They joined Buffalo Bill's Wild West in 1885. At five feet tall, Oakley was given the nickname of \\"Watanya Cicilla\\" by fellow performer Sitting Bull, rendered \\"Little Sure Shot\\" in the public advertisements. During her first engagement with the Buffalo Bill show, Oakley experienced a tense professional rivalry with rifle sharpshooter Lillian Smith. Smith was eleven years younger than Oakley, age 15 at the time she joined the show in 1886, which may have been a primary reason for Oakley to alter her actual age in later years due to Smith's press coverage becoming as favorable as hers. Oakley temporarily left the Buffalo Bill show but returned two years later, after Smith departed, in time for the Paris Exposition of 1889. This three-year tour only cemented Oakley as America's first female star. She earned more than any other performer in the show, except for \\"Buffalo Bill\\" Cody himself. She also performed in many shows on the side for extra income. In Europe, she performed for Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom, King Umberto I of Italy, President Marie Fran√ßois Sadi Carnot of France and other crowned heads of state. Oakley supposedly shot the ashes off a cigarette held by the newly crowned German Kaiser Wilhelm II at his request. Buffalo Bill's Wild West poster From 1892 to 1904, Oakley and Butler made their home in Nutley, New Jersey. Oakley promoted the service of women in combat operations for the United States armed forces. She wrote a letter to President William McKinley on April 5, 1898, \\"offering the government the services of a company of 50 'lady sharpshooters' who would provide their own arms and ammunition should the U.S. go to war with Spain.\\"The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). Letter to President William McKinley from Annie Oakley. Retrieved January 24, 2008. The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War did occur, but Oakley's offer was not accepted. Theodore Roosevelt, did, however, name his volunteer cavalry the \\"Rough Riders\\" after the \\"Buffalo Bill's Wild West and Congress of Rough Riders of the World\\" where Oakley was a major star. In 1901 (the same year as McKinley's assassination), Oakley was badly injured in a train accident but recovered after temporary paralysis and five spinal operations. She left the Buffalo Bill show and in 1902 began a less taxing acting career in a stage play written especially for her, The Western Girl. Oakley played the role of Nancy Berry who used a pistol, a rifle and rope to outsmart a group of outlaws. Throughout her career, it is believed that Oakley taught more than 15,000 women how to use a gun. Oakley believed strongly that it was crucial for women to learn how to use a gun, as not only a form of physical and mental exercise, but also to defend themselves. She said: \\"I would like to see every woman know how to handle guns as naturally as they know how to handle babies.\\"  The Little Sure Shot of the Wild West (Annie Oakley)  Annie Oakley, 1894, an \\"exhibition of rifle shooting at glass balls, etc.\\", in an Edison Kinetoscope movie Buffalo Bill was friends with Thomas Edison, and Edison built the world's largest electrical power plant at the time for the Wild West Show.

Koestler-Grack reports that, on March 19, 1884, she was being watched by Chief Sitting Bull when: > Oakley playfully skipped on stage, lifted her rifle, and aimed the barrel at > a burning candle.

Libel cases  In 1904, sensational cocaine prohibition stories were selling well. Newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst published a false story that Oakley had been arrested for stealing to support a cocaine habit. The woman actually arrested was a burlesque performer who told Chicago police that her name was Annie Oakley. Most of the newspapers that printed the story had relied on the Hearst article, and they immediately retracted it with apologies upon learning of the libelous error. Hearst, however, tried to avoid paying the anticipated court judgments of $20,000 () by sending an investigator to Darke County, Ohio, with the intent of collecting reputation- smearing gossip from Oakley's past. The investigator found nothing. Oakley spent much of the next six years winning all but one of her 55 libel lawsuits against newspapers. She collected less in judgments than the total of her legal expenses.  Later years and death  267x267px In 1912, the Butlers built a brick bungalow style home in Cambridge, Maryland. It is known as the Annie Oakley House and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. In 1917, they moved to North Carolina and returned to public life. She continued to set records into her sixties and also engaged in extensive philanthropy for women's rights and other causes, including the support of young women she knew. She embarked on a comeback and intended to star in a feature-length silent movie. She hit 100 clay targets in a row from at age 62 in a 1922 shooting contest in Pinehurst, North Carolina. In late 1922, the couple was in a car accident that forced her to wear a steel brace on her right leg. She eventually performed again after more than a year of recovery, and she set records in 1924. Her health declined in 1925 and she died of pernicious anemia in Greenville, Ohio, at the age of 66 on November 3, 1926. She was cremated and her ashes buried at Brock Cemetery, near Greenville. According to B. Haugen, Butler was so grieved by Oakley's death that he stopped eating and died 18 days later in Michigan; he was buried next to her ashes.Haugen, B., Annie Oakley: American Sharpshooter, Capstone, 2006, p. 88. Kasper reports that Butler's death certificate gave \\"senility\\" as the cause of death. One rumor claims that Oakley's ashes were placed in one of her trophies and placed with Butler's body in his coffin prior.Roadside America.com, Retrieved October 1, 2014. Both body and ashes were interred in the cemetery on Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 1926. After her death, her incomplete autobiography was given to stage comedian Fred Stone, and it was discovered that her entire fortune had been spent on her family and her charities. A vast collection of Oakley's personal possessions, performance memorabilia, and firearms are on permanent exhibit in the Garst Museum and the National Annie Oakley Center in Greenville, Ohio. She has been inducted into the Trapshooting Hall of Fame, the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame in Fort Worth, Texas, the National Women's Hall of Fame, the Ohio Women's Hall of Fame, and the New Jersey Hall of Fame.  Surname  There are a number of variations given for Oakley's family name, Mosey. Many biographers and other references give the name as \\"Moses\\". Although the 1860 U.S. Census shows the family name as \\"Mauzy\\", this is considered an error introduced by the census taker. Oakley's name appears as \\"Ann Mosey\\" in the 1870 U.S. Census and \\"Mosey\\" is engraved on her father's headstone and appears in his military record; \\"Mosey\\" is the official spelling by the Annie Oakley Foundation, maintained by her living relatives. (the answer is \\"no\\": \\"Her mother, Susan, named her Phoebe Ann‚Ä¶\\"; her father Jacob is surnamed \\"Mosey\\" in the National Archives War of 1812 military records; \\"In the 1870 Census, Annie is listed as Ann Mosey\\"but, several other surname spellings appeared later. \\"The professional name Oakley was assumed in 1882, when Annie began to perform with Frank Butler; it was not a family name.\\") The spelling \\"Mosie\\" has also appeared. According to Kasper, Oakley insisted that her family name be spelled \\"Mozee\\", leading to arguments with her brother John. Kasper speculates that Oakley may have considered \\"Mozee\\" to be a more phonetic spelling. There is also popular speculation that young Oakley had been teased about her name by other children. Prior to their double wedding in March 1884, both Oakley's brother John and one of her sisters, Hulda, changed their surnames to \\"Moses\\".  Eponym  During her lifetime, the theatre business began referring to complimentary tickets as \\"Annie Oakleys\\". Such tickets traditionally have holes punched into them (to prevent them from being resold), reminiscent of the playing cards Oakley shot through during her sharpshooting act.

Influence Oakley's worldwide stardom as a sharpshooter enabled her to earn more money than most of the other performers in the Buffalo Bill show. She did not forget her roots after gaining financial and economic power. She and Butler together often donated to charitable organizations for orphans. Beyond her monetary influence, she proved to be a great influence on women. Oakley urged that women serve in war, though President McKinley rejected her offer of woman sharpshooters for service in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Beyond this offer to the president, Oakley believed that women should learn to use a gun for the empowering image that it gave. Laura Browder discusses how Oakley's stardom gave hope to women and youth in Her Best Shot: Women and Guns In America. Oakley pressed for women to be independent and educated. She was a key influence in the creation of the image of the American cowgirl. Through this image, she provided substantial evidence that women are as capable as men when offered the opportunity to prove themselves.

Part of a gang that attempted to rob two banks in Coffeyville, Kansas, on October 5, 1892, he was the only member of five to survive, despite receiving 23 gunshot wounds. Two of his brothers were killed. After serving 14 years in prison for the crime, Dalton was pardoned. He moved to California, where he capitalized on his notoriety to publish books and become an actor in Hollywood. His first book, Beyond the Law (1918) was adapted as a film in which he played himself. His second book, When the Daltons Rode (1931), co-written with Jack Jungmeyer, Sr, was adapted after Dalton's death as a 1940 film of the same name. Early life  Dalton was born in 1871 in Missouri to Lewis (16 Feb 1826-16 Jul 1890) and Adeline (n√©e Younger) Dalton (15 Sep 1835-24 Jan 1925). He was the eighth born of nine brothers.

They hired Emmett to serve as a guard at the jail at Fort Smith, in present-day Arkansas. The elder two started working for the Osage Nation to help them set up a police force, but fled after being pursued for stealing horses. They began to conduct robberies of banks, stagecoaches, and trains. Emmett joined them, along with two other men. The Dalton Gang ended on October 5, 1892 when they attempted to rob two banks the same day in Coffeyville, Kansas. They had hoped to make enough money to flee the country. Four of the gang were killed in a gun fight with law enforcement and townsmen. Emmett Dalton was severely wounded, receiving 23 gunshot wounds, but survived. Tried and convicted, he was sentenced to life in the penitentiary in Lansing, Kansas. After fourteen years, he was pardoned by the state governor. After prison Dalton moved to Southern California that year, in 1907. He married Julia Johnson the following year, who survived him. During his California years, he wrote two books and did some acting in Hollywood. Later he sold real estate, as Southern California was developing rapidly with migrants from across the country. He died in 1937 at the age of sixty-six. In 1918, Dalton portrayed himself in the movie version of his first book, Beyond the Law. In 1931, he published When the Daltons Rode, co-written with Jack Jungmeyer, Sr., a Los Angeles journalist. It was adapted as a 1940 movie of the same name. It starred Randolph Scott, Kay Francis and Brian Donlevy. Emmett Dalton was portrayed by Frank Albertson.

It began with a surprise night attack by a squadron of Japanese destroyers on the neutral Russian fleet anchored at Port Arthur, Manchuria, and continued with an engagement the following morning; further skirmishing off Port Arthur would continue until May 1904. The attack ended inconclusively, though the war resulted in a decisive Japanese victory.  Background  The opening stage of the Russo-Japanese War began with pre- emptive strikes by the Imperial Japanese Navy against the Russian Pacific Fleet based at Port Arthur and at Chemulpo. Admiral T≈çg≈ç's initial plan was to swoop down upon Port Arthur with the 1st Division of the Combined Fleet, consisting of the six pre-dreadnought battleships , , , , and , led by the flagship , and the 2nd Division, consisting of the armored cruisers , , , , and . These capital ships and cruisers were accompanied by some 15 destroyers and around 20 smaller torpedo boats. In reserve were the cruisers , , , and . With this large, well-trained and well-armed force, and surprise on his side, Admiral T≈çg≈ç hoped to deliver a crushing blow to the Russian fleet soon after the severance of diplomatic relations between the Japanese and Russian governments. On the Russian side, Admiral Stark had the pre-dreadnought battleships , , , , , , and , supported by the armored cruiser and the protected cruisers , , , , and , all based within the protection of the fortified naval base of Port Arthur. However, the defenses of Port Arthur were not as strong as they could have been, as few of the shore artillery batteries were operational, funds for improving the defenses had been diverted to nearby Dalny, and most of the officer corps was celebrating at a party being hosted by Admiral Stark on the night of 9 February 1904. As Admiral T≈çg≈ç had received false information from local spies in and around Port Arthur that the garrisons of the forts guarding the port were on full alert, he was unwilling to risk his precious capital ships to the Russian shore artillery and therefore held back his main battle fleet. Instead, the destroyer force was split into two attack squadrons, one squadron with the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd flotillas to attack Port Arthur, and the other squadron, with the 4th and 5th flotillas, to attack the Russian base at Dalny. Battle =Night attack of 8‚Äì9 February 1904= Illustration of the destruction of Russian destroyers by Japanese destroyers at Port Arthur At about 22:30 on Monday 8 February 1904, the Port Arthur attack squadron of 10 destroyers encountered patrolling Russian destroyers. The Russians were under orders not to initiate combat, and turned to report the contact to headquarters. However, as a result of the encounter, two Japanese destroyers collided and fell behind and the remainder became scattered. At circa 00:28 on 9 February, the first four Japanese destroyers approached the port of Port Arthur without being observed, and launched a torpedo attack against the Pallada (which was hit amidship, caught fire, and keeled over) and the Retvizan (which was holed in her bow). The other Japanese destroyers were less successful; many of the torpedoes became caught in the extended torpedo nets which effectively prevented most of the torpedoes from striking the vitals of the Russian battleships. Other destroyers had arrived too late to benefit from surprise, and made their attacks individually rather than in a group. However, they were able to disable the most powerful ship of the Russian fleet, the battleship Tsesarevich. The Japanese destroyer Oboro made the last attack, around 02:00, by which time the Russians were fully awake, and their searchlights and gunfire made accurate and close range torpedo attacks impossible. Despite ideal conditions for a surprise attack, the results were relatively poor. Of the sixteen torpedoes fired, all but three either missed or failed to explode. But luck was against the Russians insofar as two of the three torpedoes hit their best battleships: the Retvizan and the Tsesarevich were put out of action for weeks, as was the protected cruiser Pallada. =Surface engagement of 9 February 1904= A Japanese torpedo boat approaches a Russian torpedo boat. A Japanese sailor attacks with a saber the commander of the enemy ship and then throws him to the sea in a furious impetus (Angelo Agostini, O Malho, 1904). Following the night attack, Admiral T≈çg≈ç sent his subordinate, Vice Admiral Dewa Shiget≈ç, with four cruisers on a reconnaissance mission at 08:00 to look into the Port Arthur anchorage and to assess the damage. By 09:00 Admiral Dewa was close enough to make out the Russian fleet through the morning mist. He observed 12 battleships and cruisers, three or four of which seemed to be badly listing or to be aground. The smaller vessels outside the harbor entrance were in apparent disarray. Dewa approached to about of the harbor, but as no notice was taken of the Japanese ships, he was convinced that the night attack had successfully paralyzed the Russian fleet, and sped off to report to Admiral T≈çg≈ç. Unaware that the Russian fleet was getting ready for battle, Dewa urged Admiral T≈çg≈ç that the moment was extremely advantageous for the main fleet to quickly attack. Although T≈çg≈ç would have preferred luring the Russian fleet away from the protection of the shore batteries, Dewa's mistakenly optimistic conclusions meant that the risk was justified. Admiral T≈çg≈ç ordered the First Division to attack the harbor, with the Third Division in reserve in the rear. Upon approaching Port Arthur the Japanese came upon the Russian cruiser Boyarin, which was on patrol. Boyarin fired on the Mikasa at extreme range, then turned and retreated. At around 12:00, at a range of about 5 miles, combat commenced between the Japanese and Russian fleets. The Japanese concentrated the fire of their 12\\" guns on the shore batteries while using their 8\\" and 6\\" against the Russian ships. Shooting was poor on both sides, but the Japanese severely damaged the Novik, Petropavlovsk, Poltava, Diana and Askold. However, it soon became evident that Admiral Dewa had made a critical error; the Russians had recovered from the initial destroyer attack, and their battleships had steam up. In the first five minutes of the battle Mikasa was hit by a ricocheting shell, which burst over her, wounding the chief engineer, the flag lieutenant, and five other officers and men, wrecking the aft bridge. At 12:20, Admiral T≈çg≈ç decided to run away and flee. It was a risky maneuver that exposed the fleet to the full brunt of the Russian shore batteries. Despite the heavy firing, the Japanese battleships completed the maneuver and rapidly fled out of range. The Shikishima, Mikasa, Fuji, and Hatsuse all took damage, receiving 7 hits amongst them. Several hits were also made on Admiral Kamimura Hikonoj≈ç's cruisers as they reached the turning point. The Russians in return had received about 5 hits, distributed amongst the battleships Petropavlovsk, Pobeda, Poltava, and the Sevastopol. During this same time, the cruiser Novik had closed to within of the Japanese cruisers and launched a torpedo salvo. All missed although the Novik had received a severe shell hit below the waterline. Aftermath =Outcome= Although the naval Battle of Port Arthur had resulted in no major warship losses, the IJN had been driven from the battlefield by the combined fire of the Russian battleships and shore batteries, thus attributing to them a minor victory. The Russians took 150 casualties to around 90 for the Japanese. Although no ship was sunk on either side, several took damage. However, the Japanese had ship repair and drydock facilities in Sasebo with which to make repairs, whereas the Russian fleet had only very limited repair capability at Port Arthur. It was obvious that Admiral Dewa had failed to press his reconnaissance closely enough, and that once the true situation was apparent, Admiral T≈çg≈ç's objection to engage the Russians under their shore batteries was justified. The formal declaration of war between Japan and Russia was issued on 10 February 1904, a day after the battle. The attack, conducted against a largely unassuming and unprepared neutral power in peacetime, has been widely compared to the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. In 1907, the Second Hague Conference adopted provisions regarding the rights and duties of neutral powers on land and sea,(V): Convention relative to the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in case of War on Land(XIII): Convention concerning the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War prohibiting nations from committing any acts of hostility against neutral countries or persons as well as requiring that a declaration of war be given before commencing the attack on a targeted party.(III): Convention relative to the Opening of Hostilities =Subsequent naval actions at Port Arthur, February‚ÄìDecember 1904= On Thursday 11 February 1904, the Russian minelayer started to mine the entrance to Port Arthur. One of the mines washed up against the ship's rudder, exploded and caused the ship to sink, with loss of 120 of the ship's complement of 200. Yenisei also sank with the only map indicating the position of the mines. The , sent to investigate the accident, also struck a mine and was abandoned, although staying afloat. She sank two days later after hitting a second mine. Admiral Togo set sail from Sasebo again on Sunday 14 February 1904, with all ships except for Fuji. On the morning of Wednesday 24 February 1904, an attempt was made to scuttle five old transport vessels to block the entry to Port Arthur, sealing the Russian fleet inside. The plan was foiled by Retvizan, which was still grounded outside the harbor. In the poor light, the Russians mistook the old transports for battleships, and an exultant Viceroy Yevgeni Alekseyev telegraphed the Tsar of his great naval victory. After daylight revealed the truth, a second telegram needed to be sent. On Tuesday 8 March 1904, Russian Admiral Stepan Makarov arrived in Port Arthur to assume command from the unfortunate Admiral Stark, thus raising Russian morale. He raised his flag on the newly repaired Askold. On the morning of Thursday 10 March 1904, the Russian fleet took to the offensive, and attacked the blockading Japanese squadron, but to little effect. In the evening of 10 March 1904, the Japanese attempted a ruse by sending four destroyers close to the harbor. The Russians took the bait, and sent out six destroyers in pursuit; whereupon the Japanese mined the entrance to the harbor and moved into position to block the destroyers' return. Two of the Russian destroyers were sunk, despite efforts by Admiral Makarov to come to their rescue. On Tuesday 22 March 1904, Fuji and Yashima were attacked by the Russian fleet under Admiral Makarov, and Fuji was forced to withdraw to Sasebo for repairs. Under Makarov, the Russian fleet was growing more confident and better trained. In response, on Sunday 27 March 1904, T≈çg≈ç again attempted to block Port Arthur, this time using four more old transports filled with stones and concrete. The attack again failed as the transports were sunk too far away from the entrance to the harbor. On 13 April 1904, Makarov (who had now transferred his flag to Petropavlovsk) left port to go to the assistance of a destroyer squadron he had sent on reconnaissance north to Dalny. He was accompanied by the Russian cruisers , , and , along with the battleships Poltava, Sevastopol, Pobeda, and Peresvet. The Japanese fleet was waiting, and Makarov withdrew towards the protection of the shore batteries at Port Arthur. However, the area had been recently mined by the Japanese. At 09:43, Petropavlovsk struck three mines, exploded and sank within two minutes. The disaster killed 635 officers and men, along with Admiral Makarov. At 10:15, Pobeda was also crippled by a mine. The following day, Admiral Togo ordered all flags to be flown at half mast, and that a day's mourning be observed for his fallen adversary. Makarov was officially replaced by Admiral Nikolai Skrydlov on 1 April 1904; however, Skrydlov was unable to reach his command due to the Japanese blockade, and remained at Vladivostok overseeing command of the Vladivostok cruiser squadron until recalled to St Petersburg on 20 December. On 3 May 1904, Admiral Togo made his third and final attempt at blocking the entrance to Port Arthur, this time with eight old transports. This attempt also failed, but Togo proclaimed it to be a success, thus clearing the way for the Japanese Second Army to land in Manchuria. Although Port Arthur was as good as blocked, due to the lack of initiative by Makarov's successors, Japanese naval losses began to mount, largely due to Russian mines. On 15 May, two Japanese battleships, the 12,320-ton and the 15,300-ton , sank in a Russian minefield off Port Arthur after they both struck at least two mines each, eliminating one-third of Japan's battleship force, the worst day for the Japanese Navy during the war. Further naval operations from Port Arthur resulted in two break-out attempts by the Russians. The first was on 23 June 1904, and the second on 10 August, the latter of which resulted in the Battle of the Yellow Sea, which was tactically inconclusive. Afterwards, the Russian fleet did not make any more attempts to break out from their port, while the Japanese fleet dominated the waters for the duration of the war. But mines laid by Russian minelayers were a continuing problem for the IJN and resulted in more losses. On 18 September 1904, the 2,150-ton gunboat struck a Russian mine west of Port Arthur and sank. The same fate befell the 2,440-ton cruiser on 30 November in the same minefield, and on 13 December, the 4,160-ton cruiser sank in another Russian minefield a few miles south of Port Arthur while giving naval gunfire support to the Japanese armies now besieging the port.

It consists of Hiiumaa (German and ), the second largest island of Estonia, and several smaller islands near it. The county borders L√§√§ne County to the east and Saare County to the south.  History  Human habitation of Hiiumaa can be traced back to the 5th millennium BC. Mesolithic sites in K√µpu peninsula are exemplified by the seal-hunters' settlements. There are several well-preserved grave fields of the Iron Age. In 1228, the island was first mentioned in written annals under the name Dageida. In 1254, Hiiumaa was divided between the Livonian Order and the Bishopric of √ñsel-Wiek. In 1563 Hiiumaa was annexed into Sweden. In 1710, as a result of the Great Northern War the island went under the control of the Russian Empire. During World War I, the German military forces occupied Hiiumaa in 1917. In 1918‚Äì1940 Hiiumaa was part of the Republic of Estonia, then until 1991 occupied by the Soviet Union. On demands of the Hanseatic League a lighthouse was built in K√µpu (previously known as Dagerort) at the beginning of the 16th century. It is considered the third-oldest continuously operating lighthouse in the world, still showing its light to of the sea. Most of the farm architecture comes from the 19th century. Prominent examples include the Mihkli farming complex and Soera farm-museum with historical national artifacts, respectively.

Between 2013 and 2017 the county was subdivided into 4 municipalities ( ‚Äì parishes). The only urban settlement K√§rdla is part of Hiiumaa Parish since 2017. Rural municipalities: * Hiiumaa Parish (includes the town of K√§rdla)  Geography  The county includes the islands of Hiiumaa () and Kassari () and a number of surrounding islets. The highest point is Tornim√§gi hill (), the longest river is Luguse (), and the biggest lake is Tihu Suurj√§rv (). In the landscapes there can be found pine forests, mixed spruce and deciduous forests, swampy thickets and juniper shrubs, coastal meadows and bogs. The most frequent tree is pine which makes about a half of forests. Pine is followed by birch, spruce and alder. In total, there are about 1,000 species of vascular plants, of which about 100 are under protection. The wildlife of Hiiumaa is remarkable. Out of 30 species of mammals, big game as elk, deer, fox, wild boar and lynx roam the island. There are about 250 species of birds on the island, 195 of them nesting. Among the Estonian counties Hiiumaa is the richest in forest ‚Äì nearly 60% of the island are wooded areas. There are large marsh areas in the middle of the island. The marshes cover about 7% of its area. Cultivated land and settlements take about 23% of the area of the county.  Gallery  K√µrgessaare.

Wm Nicholson) (1790) and Vol.2 He is considered a national hero in Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia. Benyovszky was born and raised in Verb√≥, Kingdom of Hungary (present-day Vrbov√©, Slovakia). In 1769, while fighting for the Polish armies under the Bar Confederation, he was captured by the Russians and exiled to Kamchatka. He subsequently escaped and returned to Europe via Macau and Mauritius, arriving in France. In 1773, Benyovszky reached agreement with the French government to establish a trading post on Madagascar. Facing significant problems with the climate, the terrain, and the native Sakalava people, he abandoned the trading post in 1776. Benyovszky then returned to Europe, joined the Austrian Army and fought in the War of the Bavarian Succession. After a failed venture in Fiume (present-day Rijeka), he travelled to America and obtained financial backing for a second voyage to Madagascar. The French governor of Mauritius sent a small armed force to close down his operation, and Benyovszky was killed in May 1786. In 1790, Benyovszky's posthumous and largely fictitious account of his adventures (entitled Memoirs and Travels of Mauritius Augustus Count de Benyowsky) was published to great success.

When she married S√°muel Benyovszky, she was the widow of an army general (Josef Pestvarmegyey, d.1743).

This action led his mother's family to file a criminal complaint against him, and he was called to stand trial in Nyitra (present-day Nitra). Before the conclusion of the trial, Benyovszky fled to Poland to join his uncle, Jan Tibor Benyowski de Benyo, a Polish nobleman. His flight violated a legal edict forbidding him to leave the country.

Wm Nicholson) (1790) Instead he managed to persuade the Royal Society of London luminary Jean Hyacinthe de Magellan to fund an independent expedition; in return, Magellan received full publishing rights over the manuscript of Benyovszky‚Äôs Memoirs, and the grand title of ‚ÄòEuropean Plenipotentiary‚Äô for Benyovszky‚Äôs new trading company.Prosper Cultru: Un Empereur de Madagascar au 18i√®me Si√®cle: Benyowszky.

Paris (1906) =Second expedition to Madagascar= In April 1784, Benyovszky and several trading partners sailed to America, where a contract was agreed to with two Baltimore traders, Zollichofer and Meissonier.Prosper Cultru: Un Empereur de Madagascar au 18i√®me Si√®cle: Benyowszky. Paris (1906) The deal was for monetary investment in return for a regular supply of slaves. In October of that year, the ship Intrepid sailed for Madagascar, arriving near Cap St Sebastien in north-west of the island, June 1785. Here the expedition was met with aggression from the Sakalava people; Benyovszky and a number of others were captured and disappeared, presumed dead. The surviving members of the company sailed for Mozambique, sold the ship and dispersed.Prosper Cultru: Un Empereur de Madagascar au 18i√®me Si√®cle: Benyowszky. Paris (1906) In January 1786, however, Benyovszky was reported to be alive and operating at Angonsty (near modern-day Ambohitralanana). Anxious about another disruption to trade, Fran√ßois de Souillac, the French governor of Mauritius waited for fair winds and then sent a small military force over to Madagascar to deal with Benyovszky. On 23 or 24 May 1786, Benyovszky was ambushed and killed by these troops, and was buried on the site of his encampment.Alexis Rochon: Voyage to Madagascar and the East Indies (trans.

In: Hungarian Studies, Vol.21, Part 1, (2007) His legacy resides largely in his autobiography (Memoirs and Travels of Mauritius Augustus Count de Benyowsky), which was published in two volumes in 1790 by friends of Magellan, who was by then, as a result of the failed Madagascan venture, in serious financial difficulties. Even at the time of the first publication of the book, it was met with significant scepticism by reviewers.The Gentleman‚Äôs Magazine and Historical Chronicle, Vol.60, Pt.2. London, (1790) Alexis Rochon: Voyage to Madagascar and the East Indies (trans.

In it, he gives a romanticised version of Benyovszky's career. Fiedler appears to have made an effort to find out if Benyovszky was still remembered by the island's people - with mixed results. In fact his name did survive in Madagascar - in recent years, a street in the island capital Antananarivo was renamed 'Lalana Benyowski'. http://www.mfa.gov.pl/en/news/poland_s__king__of_madagascar_remembered  Notes/Citations  Further reading    * External links * Website (in English) containing background materials and links to other resources relevant to Benyovszky's life.

The locality is a large one, and contains two other towns, Heronvale () and Merinda (). The Abbot Point coal shipping port is also within the locality. At the 2016 census, Bowen had a population of 10,377. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License . Geography Bowen is located on the north-east coast, in North Queensland, Australia, at exactly twenty degrees south of the equator. Bowen is halfway between Townsville and Mackay, and by road from Brisbane. Bowen sits on a square peninsula, with the Coral Sea to the north, east, and south. To the south-east is Port Denison. On the western side, where the peninsula connects with the mainland, the Don River's alluvial plain provides fertile soil that supports a prosperous farming industry. Merinda is a hinterland town west of the town of Bowen. The Bruce Highway enters the locality from the east, approaches but does not enter the town of Bowen itself, but then turns west to pass through Merinda before exiting the locality to the north-west. The North Coast railway line follows a similar route through the locality but enters the town of Bowen which is served by the Bowen railway station. At Merinda railway station, there is the junction with the Collinsville-Newlands railway line servicing the Bowen basin Coalfields. The Collinsville-Newlands line extends to the coal-handling port at Abbot Point, also within the locality of Bowen. The railway station servicing the port is the Abbot Point railway station. Heronvale is a small coastal town by road south of the town of Bowen, accessed via the Bruce Highway and then Heronvale Road. In the west of the locality is the Mount Aberdeen National Park. Two of Bowen's main streets are named after officers of the British colonial paramilitary Native Police force. Powell Street is named after Lieutenant Walter David Taylor Powell and Williams Street is named after Lieutenant Ewan G. Williams. Economy The town enjoys a diversified and prosperous economy based on agriculture, fishing, tourism, and mining. Its unusually dry climate for a tropical location, plus its fertile alluvial soil, makes it the ideal place to grow a wide variety of small crops, including tomatoes, rockmelons (i.e., cantaloupes), and capsicums (i.e., bell peppers). Outside the alluvial plain, much of the Bowen area is used for beef cattle. Just north of Bowen is the Abbot Point coal loading port. Coal mined inland of Bowen in Collinsville and other towns in the Bowen Basin is brought by rail to a deepwater pier to be loaded on bulk carriers. Coal is exported mainly to China and India. Government In 1944, Bowen elected a Communist, Fred Paterson, to Queensland Legislative Assembly. He was re-elected in 1947, but lost the seat in 1950 when the boundaries were changed to include Bowen in the seat of Whitsunday. Bowen was the administrative centre for the Shire of Bowen. On 15 March 2008, under the Local Government (Reform Implementation) Act 2007 passed by the Parliament of Queensland on 10 August 2007, the Shire of Bowen merged with the Shire of Whitsunday to form the Whitsunday Region. Although Proserpine is the administrative centre for the new regional council, the council maintains offices in Bowen and holds a number of council meetings in Bowen each year. History Bowen Turf Club, ca. 1910Biri (also known as Birri) is a language of Central and North Queensland. Biri refers to a language chain extending from Central Queensland towards Townsville and is often used as a universal name for other languages and/or dialects across the region. The language area includes the towns of Bowen, Ayr, Collinsville and Nebo. Yuru (also known as Juru, Euronbba, Juru, Mal Mal, Malmal) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken on Yuru country. The Yuru language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Shire of Burdekin, including the town of Home Hill. =British exploration and incursion= Captain James Cook named Cape Gloucester on his voyage of exploration up the Australian coast in 1770. This \\"cape\\" turned out to be an island, and Gloucester Island dominates the view from Bowen's eastern beaches. Behind the island is a bay that forms an excellent port, which the town came to be built around. The first British exploration of this bay was in 1859 by Captain Henry Daniel Sinclair, in response to a reward offered by the colony of New South Wales for finding a port somewhere north of Rockhampton. Sinclair named Port Denison after the colonial governor of New South Wales, William Denison. On 11 September 1860, George Elphinstone Dalrymple on his naval excursion in the schooner \\"Spitfire\\" to search for the mouth of the Burdekin River, landed in Port Denison. He named and climbed Mount Gordon to survey the region and observed that a river (later named the Don River) traversed a valley just behind Port Denison and into the sea. This river was \\"lined with camps and bush fires of the natives\\" indicating \\"the locality to be very thickly inhabited\\". The \\"Spitfire\\" continued its exploration north to Magnetic Island, but the surveyors came to the conclusion that the northeastern shore Port Denison was the most suitable site in the region for settlement especially as the large native wells present in a creek bed there could be utilised as a water supply. On 5 October, Dalrymple again came ashore to appropriate control of these wells. He writes: Confident in having secured a beach-head, Dalrymple explored the immediate vicinity near the wells that was to become the town of Bowen. He found a large Aboriginal tomb in the hills behind the beach that was in the form of a raised mound covered in bark with its surroundings swept clean and the paths leading to it closed off with branches. A similar tomb was found on nearby Stone Island. After a few days, Dalrymple and his surveying party on the \\"Spitfire\\" returned south. =Establishment of the town= In 1861, George Elphinstone Dalrymple set out again for the area, leading an overland expedition from Rockhampton, complemented with a naval contingent to rendezvous at Port Denison and establish a permanent settlement. Dalrymple planned this two pronged entry into the area because 'a sudden cooperation of land and sea forces..would either strike terror, which would result in immediate flight, or enable a blow to be struck' against the local aboriginals of which many had been seen camped around the harbour. To facilitate this plan, Dalrymple travelled with Lieutenant Williams and six Native Police troopers, while Lieutenant Walter Powell and his troopers travelled on the ships. These ships were the Jeannie Dove and the Santa Barbara under the command of Capt. McDermott. The maritime group arrived first and waited for Dalrymple's overland party by camping on Stone Island at the mouth of the harbour. Dalrymple's group, which included 140 horses and 121 cattle, arrived on 11 April 1861. He rode down to the area on the foreshore 'beside the native wells' (which was to be the water supply of the settlement) in order 'to clear off the aborigines from the same, should such be necessary' and to signal McDermott's group on Stone Island. The local aboriginals had already fled. The settlers on Stone Island then came over to the site and the town of Port Denison was founded. Dalrymple wrote that it was 'Deeply gratifying to me to see the British flag flying over the spot where..a few days ago, the wild aboriginal held undisputed sway', and that the settlement marked 'the advance of another great wave of Anglo-Australian energy'. After Queensland had separated from New South Wales, the town was renamed Bowen after the first Queensland colonial governor, Sir George Bowen. Port Denison Post Office opened in April 1861 and was renamed Bowen by 1865. =Shipwrecks= In 1863, settlers in the area encountered a sailor, James Morrill, who had been shipwrecked 17 years previously on a shoal in the Coral Sea. He had made it to the Queensland coast on a makeshift raft with a few companions. The others had all died within two years, but Morrill lived with the local Aborigines in the Townsville area. Rejoining European society after white settlement began in North Queensland, he settled in Bowen. His grave is in the Bowen cemetery. The coral reefs around Bowen are the scene of several shipwrecks, including the SS Gothenburg, which sank in 1875 with a loss of more than 100 lives. Numerous relics of Bowen's history, from the Aboriginal past onwards, are on display at the Bowen Historical Society's museum. =Schools= Bowen State School opened in 1865. Between 1877 and 1922, it operated as two schools: Bowen Boys State School and Bowen Girls and Infants State School. A secondary department was added to Bowen State School in 1928. On 23 January 1961, the secondary department was replaced by Bowen State High School. St Mary's School was opened on 1 September 1872 by Sister M. Gertrude and Sister M. de Sales, both members of the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart founded by Mother Mary MacKillop. Following to ongoing conflict between MacKillop and James Quinn, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Brisbane, over who controlled the schools operated by the Sisters in Queensland, Quinn expelled the sisters from his diocese in 1880 and they returned to South Australia where the order was first established. Quinn established a group of Diocesan Sisters using the name Sisters of the Holy Family who operated the school under Quinn's direct authority until 1885, when the Sisters of Mercy took over the running of the school withSister Mary Modwena Taylor, Sister M. Stanislaus Kostka Harding and Sister M. Winifred Duggan being transferred from The Range Convent School in Rockhampton. Merinda Provisional School opened in 1898 and became Merinda State School on 1 January 1909. Queens Beach State School opened on 25 November 1940. =World War 2= Catalina flying boats from No. 11 Squadron RAAF. During World War 2 Bowen hosted an air force base, flying PBY Catalina flying boats to search for enemy ships and submarines. The concrete aprons and ramp are still present (2013), and silhouettes of two aircraft have been painted in.  Heritage listings  Bowen has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Flemington Road: Flemington Road Cemetery * 6 Herbert Street: Bowen Harbour Board Building * 46 Herbert Street: Bowen Post Office * 29 Kennedy Street: Bowen State School * 30 Williams Street: Bowen Courthouse Population According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 10,377 people in Bowen. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 9.2% of the population. * 74.2% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were New Zealand 2.4%, England 2.0%, South Korea 1.3%, Philippines 1.1% and Taiwan 1.0%. * 81.5% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 1.5% and Korean 1.2%, * The most common responses for religion were No Religion 25.8%, Catholic 20.5% and Anglican 17.6%. Climate The town has a tropical savannah climate (K√∂ppen climate classification: Aw). It is noticeably drier than surrounding locations due to a rain shadow effect produced by the nearby Gloucester Island. Due to the town's latitude, the trade winds provide a pleasant breeze. The warmest month is January, with an average maximum temperature of 31 ¬∞C (88 ¬∞F). The coolest month is July, with an average maximum temperature of 25 ¬∞C (77 ¬∞F) and an average overnight minimum of 13 ¬∞C (57 ¬∞F). Television Bowen is serviced by Six free to air channels. Bowen picks up regional affiliates and can possibly pick up Brisbane channels. The Brisbane channels are: * Seven Brisbane (BTQ) * Nine Brisbane (QTQ) * Ten Brisbane (TVQ) The regional affiliates are: * Seven Queensland (STQ) * WIN Television * Southern Cross Nine Foxtel is also available in the Bowen area Tourism The Big Mango, Bowen, Queensland.Bowen is on a peninsula, with ocean on three sides. This gives eight beaches surrounding the town, namely Kings Beach, Queens Beach, Horseshoe Bay, Murrays Bay, Greys Bay, Rose Bay, and the Front Beach. There is also the clothing-optional Coral Bay. Kings Beach offers views of nearby Gloucester Island. On the western half of Queens Beach and all of Kings Beach, it is permitted to walk a dog without a leash. The Big Mango, costing $90,000 to create, was erected in 2002 as a tourist attraction at the Bowen Tourist Information Centre. In February 2014, the 10-metre high, seven-tonne fibreglass structure was stolen in an overnight operation. The mango was found the next day and it was later revealed that the theft had been a publicity stunt. =Australia= In December 2006, it was announced that Bowen was chosen as a filming location for a third of the production of Australia, directed by Baz Luhrmann and starring Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman, portraying the look of Darwin. Bowen was chosen as a prospect due to the financing of $500,000 by the Queensland government. The production moved to Bowen on 14 May 2007. When it was announced that Australia was to be filmed in Bowen, locals painted a large \\"Bowenwood\\" sign on an old water tank on top of a hill, in a parody of the world-famous Hollywood sign. Facilities Whitsunday Regional Council operates Bowen Public Library at 67 Herbert Street. The library opened in 1965 with refurbishments in 1978 and 2012.

It is strong, resilient, and iridescent. Nacre is found in some of the most ancient lineages of bivalves, gastropods, and cephalopods. However, the inner layer in the great majority of mollusc shells is porcellaneous, not nacreous, and this usually results in a non-iridescent shine, or more rarely in non-nacreous iridescence such as flame structure as is found in conch pearls. The outer layer of cultured pearls and the inside layer of pearl oyster and freshwater pearl mussel shells are made of nacre. Other mollusc families that have a nacreous inner shell layer include marine gastropods such as the Haliotidae, the Trochidae and the Turbinidae. Physical characteristics = Structure and appearance= Schematic of the microscopic structure of nacre layers Electron microscopy image of a fractured surface of nacre Nacre is composed of hexagonal platelets of aragonite (a form of calcium carbonate) 10‚Äì20 ¬µm wide and 0.5 ¬µm thick arranged in a continuous parallel lamina. Depending on the species, the shape of the tablets differ; in Pinna, the tablets are rectangular, with symmetric sectors more or less soluble. Whatever the shape of the tablets, the smallest units they contain are irregular rounded granules. These layers are separated by sheets of organic matrix (interfaces) composed of elastic biopolymers (such as chitin, lustrin and silk-like proteins). This mixture of brittle platelets and the thin layers of elastic biopolymers makes the material strong and resilient, with a Young's modulus of 70 GPa (when dry). Strength and resilience are also likely to be due to adhesion by the \\"brickwork\\" arrangement of the platelets, which inhibits transverse crack propagation. This structure, at multiple length sizes, greatly increases its toughness, making it almost as strong as silicon. The statistical variation of the platelets has a negative effect on the mechanical performance (stiffness, strength, and energy absorption) because statistical variation precipitates localization of deformation . However, the negative effects of statistical variations can be offset by interfaces with large strain at failure accompanied by strain hardening . On the other hand, the fracture toughness of nacre increases with moderate statistical variations which creates tough regions where the crack gets pinned . But, higher statistical variations generates very weak regions which allows the crack to propagate without much resistance causing the fracture toughness decreases . Nacre appears iridescent because the thickness of the aragonite platelets is close to the wavelength of visible light. These structures interfere constructively and destructively with different wavelengths of light at different viewing angles, creating structural colours. The crystallographic c-axis points approximately perpendicular to the shell wall, but the direction of the other axes varies between groups. Adjacent tablets have been shown to have dramatically different c-axis orientation, generally randomly oriented within ~20¬∞ of vertical. In bivalves and cephalopods, the b-axis points in the direction of shell growth, whereas in the monoplacophora it is the a-axis that is this way inclined. The interlocking of bricks of nacre has large impact on both the deformation mechanism as well as its toughness. In addition, the mineral‚Äìorganic interface results in enhanced resilience and strength of the organic interlayers. =Formation= Nacre formation is not fully understood. The initial onset assembly, as observed in Pinna nobilis, is driven by the aggregation of nanoparticles (~50‚Äì80 nm) within an organic matrix that arrange in fibre-like polycrystalline configurations. The particle number increases successively and, when critical packing is reached, they merge into early- nacre platelets. Nacre growth is mediated by organics, controlling the onset, duration and form of crystal growth. Individual aragonite \\"bricks\\" are believed to quickly grow to the full height of the nacreous layer, and expand until they abut adjacent bricks. This produces the hexagonal close-packing characteristic of nacre. Bricks may nucleate on randomly dispersed elements within the organic layer, well-defined arrangements of proteins, or may grow epitaxially from mineral bridges extending from the underlying tablet. Nacre differs from fibrous aragonite ‚Äì a brittle mineral of the same form ‚Äì in that the growth in the c-axis (i.e., approximately perpendicular to the shell, in nacre) is slow in nacre, and fast in fibrous aragonite. =Function= Fossil nautiloid shell with original iridescent nacre in fossiliferous asphaltic limestone, Oklahoma. Dated to the late Middle Pennsylvanian, which makes it by far the oldest deposit in the world with aragonitic nacreous shelly fossils.Buckhorn Lagerst√§tte of Oklahoma Click on photo for more information. Nacre is secreted by the epithelial cells of the mantle tissue of various molluscs. The nacre is continuously deposited onto the inner surface of the shell, the iridescent nacreous layer, commonly known as mother of pearl. The layers of nacre smooth the shell surface and help defend the soft tissues against parasites and damaging debris by entombing them in successive layers of nacre, forming either a blister pearl attached to the interior of the shell, or a free pearl within the mantle tissues. The process is called encystation and it continues as long as the mollusc lives. =In different mollusc groups= The form of nacre varies from group to group. In bivalves, the nacre layer is formed of single crystals in a hexagonal close packing. In gastropods, crystals are twinned, and in cephalopods, they are pseudohexagonal monocrystals, which are often twinned. Commercial sources The main commercial sources of mother of pearl have been the pearl oyster, freshwater pearl mussels, and to a lesser extent the abalone, popular for their sturdiness and beauty in the latter half of the 19th century. Widely used for pearl buttons especially during the 1900s, were the shells of the great green turban snail Turbo marmoratus and the large top snail, Tectus niloticus. The international trade in mother of pearl is governed by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, an agreement signed by more than 170 countries.Jessica Hodin, \\"Contraband Chic: Mother-of-Pearl Items Sell With Export Restrictions\\", New York Observer, October 20, 2010 Decorative uses File:Fl√ºgelretabel Perlmutt Augsburg um 1520.jpgAltarpiece, circa 1520, with extensive use of carved nacre.

The natural nacre may be artificially tinted to almost any color. Nacre tesserae may be cut into shapes and laminated to a ceramic tile or marble base. The tesserae are hand-placed and closely sandwiched together, creating an irregular mosaic or pattern (such as a weave). The laminated material is typically about thick. The tesserae are then lacquered and polished creating a durable and glossy surface. Instead of using a marble or tile base, the nacre tesserae can be glued to fiberglass. The result is a lightweight material that offers a seamless installation and there is no limit to the sheet size. Nacre sheets may be used on interior floors, exterior and interior walls, countertops, doors and ceilings. Insertion into architectural elements, such as columns or furniture is easily accomplished. =Fashion= Nacre bracelet Mother of pearl buttons are used in clothing either for functional or decorative purposes. The Pearly Kings and Queens are an elaborate example of this. Nacre is also used to decorate watches, knives, guns and jewellery. =Musical instruments= Nacre inlay is often used for music keys and other decorative motifs on musical instruments. Many accordion and concertina bodies are completely covered in nacre, and some guitars have fingerboard or headstock inlays made of nacre (as well as some guitars having plastic inlays designed to imitate the appearance of nacre). The bouzouki and baglamas (Greek plucked string instruments of the lute family) typically feature nacre decorations, as does the related Middle Eastern oud (typically around the sound holes and on the back of the instrument). Bows of stringed instruments such as the violin and cello often have mother of pearl inlay at the frog. It is traditionally used on saxophone keytouches, as well as the valve buttons of trumpets and other brass instruments. The Middle Eastern goblet drum (darbuka) is commonly decorated by mother of pearl. = Firearms = Mother of pearl is often used in decorative firearm's grips and other gun furniture. =Other= Mother of pearl is sometimes used to make spoon-like utensils for caviar, so as to not spoil the taste with metallic spoons.  Manufactured nacre  In 2012, researchers created calcium-based nacre in the laboratory by mimicking its natural growth process. In 2014, researchers used lasers to create an analogue of nacre by engraving networks of wavy 3D \\"micro- cracks\\" in glass. When the slides were subjected to an impact, the micro- cracks absorbed and dispersed the energy, keeping the glass from shattering. Altogether, treated glass was reportedly 200 times tougher than untreated glass. See also * Ammolite * Mollusc shell * Pearl * Raden References Further reading  Checa, Antonio G.; Julyan H. E.

The practice originated in the Appalachian region of the United States and is based on a literal interpretation of the following biblical passage: The beliefs and practices of the movement have been documented in several films and have been the impetus for a number of state laws related to the handling of venomous animals. History =The Church of God with Signs Following= The practice of snake-handling first appeared in American Christianity around 1910Encyclopedia of American Religions gives the year as 1909; the Encyclopedia of Religion in the South gives it as 1913. and was associated with the ministry of George Went Hensley of Grasshopper Valley in southeastern Tennessee. Hensley was a minister of the Church of God, now known as the Church of God (Cleveland), founded by Richard Spurling and A. J. Tomlinson. In the 1920s, the Church of God repudiated the practice of snake-handling, and Hensley and his followers formed a separate Trinitarian body. =The Church of Lord Jesus with Signs Following= Serpent- handling in north Alabama and north Georgia originated with James Miller in Sand Mountain, Alabama, at about the same time. Miller apparently developed his belief independently of any knowledge of Hensley's ministry. This section of the snake-handling churches is non-Trinitarian, and is broadly known as the Church of Lord Jesus with Signs Following. This version dominates snake- handling churches north of the Appalachians. Each church body is independent and autonomous, and the denominational name is not consistent in all areas, although it is almost always some variation of the name \\"Church of God\\" (Trinitarian) or \\"Church of (Lord) Jesus\\" (Oneness). The exact membership is unknown, and has recently been estimated as low as 1,000 and as high as 5,000 with possibly fifty to a hundred congregations. According to the Encyclopedia of American Religions, churches \\"can be found from central Florida to West Virginia and as far west as Columbus, Ohio.\\" The snake-handling sect of beliefs and practices go as far as to cross the border into Western Canada in 2004 to Lethbridge and Edmonton, Alberta. Beliefs and practices Worship services usually include singing, praying, speaking in tongues, and preaching. The front of the church, behind the pulpit, is the designated area for handling snakes. Rattlesnakes, cottonmouths, and copperheads (venomous snakes native to North America) are the most common, but even cobras have been used. During the service, believers may approach the front and pick up the snakes, usually raising them into the air and sometimes allowing the snakes to crawl on their bodies. The snakes are considered incarnations of demons, and handling the snakes demonstrates one's power over them. Members are not required to handle the snakes. Some believers will also engage in drinking poison (most commonly strychnine) at this time. Over sixty cases of death as the result of snakebites in religious worship services have been documented in the United States. If a handler is bitten, it is generally interpreted as a lack of faith or failure to follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit. But individual incidents may actually be understood in a variety of ways. Bitten believers usually do not seek medical help, but look to God for their healing. Beginning in 1936, six southeastern states outlawed snake-handling. George Went Hensley died in Florida in 1955 from a venomous snakebite. The practice of handling snakes has been made illegal in a number of states. In Tennessee, it is illegal to display any venomous reptile in a manner that endangers anyone. Alabama has a similar statute. In Kentucky, it is illegal to display any reptile at a religious ceremony. Prosecutions, however, are rare. In other areas of belief, the Church of God with Signs Following holds doctrines and practices similar to related Church of God. They maintain a strict teaching of standards of holiness in daily living, baptism in the Holy Spirit, divine healing, water baptism, and footwashing. They (COGWSF) also stress Romans 16:16 - \\"Salute another with a Holy Kiss. The Church of God (Cleveland, TN) places no emphasis on this scripture in any tenet of faith or practice. Believers generally adhere to strict dress codes such as uncut hair, no cosmetics, the wearing of ankle-length dresses with pantyhose for women, and short hair and long-sleeved shirts for men. Most ministers preach against any use of all types of tobacco and alcohol. Scriptural interpretations The distinctive practice of these churches is variously known as serpent-handling, snake-handling, and taking up serpents. Many people consider snake-handling to be a part of uneducated folk religion, however, churches who practice snake handling claim their scriptural mandate from the Gospel of . This passage is arguably a later addition to Mark, and is footnoted as such in most well known translations of the Bible. Even those denominations who affirm this passage as canonical do not interpret the passage as a call to handle serpents; they regard snake handling as the grave error of \\"tempting God\\" and the passage as a statement of signs demonstrating Paul's apostleship (cf. Acts 28:3-6). See also * Holy Ghost People - documentary * Heaven Come Down - documentary References Further reading *American Originals: Homemade Varieties of Christianity (1997), by Paul K.

In 1927, he designed the Futura typeface, which became one of the most successful and most-used types of the 20th century. He was born in Wernigerode, and died in H√∂dingen. He had a strict Protestant upbringing, being educated in a 19th-century Gymnasium. He was brought up to have a very German sense of leadership, of duty and responsibility. He disliked abstract art and many forms of modern culture, such as jazz, cinema, and dancing. But equally, he admired the functionalist strain in modernism. Thus, Renner can be seen as a bridge between the traditional (19th century) and the modern (20th century). He attempted to fuse the Gothic and the roman typefaces. Renner was a prominent member of the Deutscher Werkbund (German Work Federation). Two of his major texts are Typografie als Kunst (Typography as Art) and Die Kunst der Typographie (The Art of Typography). He created a new set of guidelines for good book design and invented the popular Futura, a geometric sans-serif font used by many typographers throughout the 20th century and today. The typeface Architype Renner is based upon Renner's early experimental exploration of geometric letterforms for the Futura typeface, most of which were deleted from the face's character set before it was issued. Tasse, a 1994 typeface is a revival of Renner's 1953 typeface Steile Futura. Renner was a friend of the eminent German typographer Jan Tschichold and a key participant in the heated ideological and artistic debates of that time. Politics Even before 1932, Renner made his opposition to the Nazis very clear, notably in his book ‚ÄúKulturbolschewismus?‚Äù (Cultural Bolshevism?). He was unable to find a German publisher, so it was published by his Swiss friend Eugen Rentsch. After the Nazis seized power in March 1933, Paul was arrested and dismissed from his post in Munich in 1933, and subsequently emigrated to Switzerland. Soon after the book's publication, it was withdrawn from the German book market, until a photo-mechanical reprint was issued by Stroemfeld Verlag, Frankfurt am Main/Basel, in 2003. The new edition included comments by Roland Reuss and Peter Staengle (a main source for these notes).paul renner: kulturbolschewismus?

It was conceived by Kurt Tank as a twin-engine, high- performance fighter, but the Luftwaffe saw no role for the design, perceiving it as intermediate between the Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Bf 110. Later prototypes were adapted to two-seats to compete with the Bf 110 in the Zerst√∂rer (heavy fighter) role, but only nine aircraft were built in total. Design and development In the early to mid-1930s, developments in airframe design outstripped available aircraft engine power, allowing large aircraft to be built that existing engines were unable to sufficiently lift or propel (at least not alone). A period ensued in which multi-engine designs mostly outperformed aircraft designed with just one engine. In air racing in Europe, the Dornier Do 17 - a military design concealed under the guise of civilian use - outran every single-engine fighter it competed against. In Nazi Germany, this led to the idea of the \\"schnellbomber\\", fast bombers that were expected to fly right past the defensive fighters. Although this period of twin-engine superiority would be short-lived, it also led to many air forces considering twin-engine fighter designs. In 1935, Kurt Tank made the suggestion of creating a long-range single-seat fighter under a private venture within Focke-Wulf. The idea was not to produce a heavy fighter or bomber destroyer like the Bf 110, but instead a long-range design that would have the performance of a single-seat design. Powered by the new 736 kW (1,000 PS) Daimler-Benz DB 600, it had an expected speed of 560 km/h (350 mph). The design was unveiled in 1936 at an exhibition of new weapons, prototypes and projects held at the Henschel factory at Berlin-Sch√∂nefeld, where it was viewed by a number of high-ranking Nazi officials, including Hitler. However, the Reich Air Ministry (RLM) rejected the design on the grounds that the single-engine Bf 109 had comparable performance but would cost roughly half as much. The need for a long-range design was not considered serious, as at the time it was believed bomber escort was simply not needed. =Prototypes= Tank then took the design directly to Wolfram von Richthofen, chief of the development section of the Technischen Amt, the research and development arm of the RLM. Richthofen was not so convinced that bomber performance would remain superior to fighters, and gave the go-ahead for the construction of three prototypes, but on the condition that they replace the DB 600, which was in extremely short supply, with the less-powerful 515 kW (700 PS) Junkers Jumo 210. R. Blaser was assigned to detail design. In order to improve performance compared to the Bf 110, the fuselage was made as small as possible, so small that there was no room on the instrument panel for the complete set of engine instruments, some of which were instead moved to the inside faces of the engine nacelles, as would also be done for the Henschel Hs 129 ground attack aircraft and some versions of the Bf 110. The engine nacelles were relatively normal, including both the engine and the main landing gear storage, but the front-mounted radiators for the engines were retractable for high speed when less frontal area would be needed to get the same airflow (an idea which was in some vogue at the time, and also used in the French Morane-Saulnier M.S.406). The mainwheels were fully retractable and faired and the design of the wing and tailplane required no struts or supports (unlike some late 1930s designs, such as early Bf 109s), in order to further reduce drag. The wing's two spars passed under the pilot's seat. As was common on pre-war designs, the line of the rear fuselage flowed straight into the line of the canopy, which created less drag than a bubble canopy, but also blocked direct viewing to the rear, although there were cutouts in the rear fuselage and the rear section of the canopy, which opened rearward and upward at an angle of about 15¬∞, extended some ways to the rear to provide a degree of vision over the pilot's shoulder, if not directly rearward (the forward section of the canopy, over the pilot himself, hinged forwards in an unusual fashion). Although the cockpit was located well forward, a small window panel was fitted in the underside of the nose by the pilot's feet to improve the view for landing. The first prototype, Fw 187 V1 (D-AANA), flew for the first time in late spring 1937, with Hans Sander at its controls. In testing it demonstrated a speed of 523 km/h (325 mph) despite the use of the low-powered Jumo engines; 80 km/h (50 mph) faster than the contemporary Jumo-powered Messerschmitt Bf 109B, despite having twice the range, more than twice the weight, and using two of the same engines. Members of the RLM complained that this was due to faulty flight instruments, but further testing ruled this out. The Fw 187's climb and dive rates were also on par - if not superior - to the single-seater. Several changes were made to the design as a result of the testing, including new DVL propellers in place of the original Junkers-Hamiltons, and experimental twin- wheel bogies that were abandoned after testing. Blaser was concerned about flutter in the rudder at high speed and had a weight fitted to reduce it but in testing this caused so much flutter it was torn off at high speed. A second prototype followed with fixed radiators rather than earlier retractable versions, a semi-retractable tailwheel, changes to the elevator, and a vertical stabilizer with reduced chord. The engine was also upgraded to the 210G version of the Jumo, featuring direct fuel injection which resulted in a significant increase in power. New ejector-type exhaust stacks also contributed to increased speed by directing engine exhaust to the rear. Fw 187 V2 started testing in the summer of 1937, but crashed on landing when part of the main landing gear failed, and V1 was destroyed on 14 May 1938 after a high-speed pass over the Bremen facilities when the pilot, Paul Bauer, pulled up too sharply at the end of the pass resulting in a stall that sent the aircraft spinning into the ground. =Two-seater prototypes= Ernst Udet had replaced von Richthofen in 1936. An influential proponent of high-speed monoplane fighters, he nonetheless demanded manoeuvrability and doubted twin- engine designs could ever fully compete with single-engine types. Nevertheless, he felt the performance of the aircraft warranted development as a potential replacement for the Bf 110 in the bomber destroyer role. Even before V1 flew, Tank had been instructed to convert the design to a two-seater for this role despite the requirement for a second crew member in this role being marginal. The first two prototypes were already at an advanced stage of construction at this point, so two-seater work began on the third prototype which had just begun construction. Blaser adapted the design by stretching the fuselage slightly but the inclusion of a second crew member altered the center of gravity which demanded the engine nacelles be modified to correct changes to handling characteristics. A new extended-length cockpit \\"framed\\" canopy was added, but due to the high line of the fuselage there was no easy way to include defensive rear-facing armament, relegating the second crew member to the role of radio operator. It was intended the offensive armament be improved by replacing two 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17 machine guns with 20 mm MG FF cannons, although these were never actually fitted. Fw 187 V3 (D-ORHP) flew in spring 1938, but it suffered a starboard engine fire during one of the initial test flights and damaged its main landing gear in the resulting forced landing. It was quickly repaired and returned to service. Two additional two- seat prototypes, V4 (D-OSNP) and V5 (D-OTGN), followed in the summer and autumn of 1938 respectively. While also powered by the Jumo 210, their performance was disappointing and led to a decision that any advantages of the new type would not warrant the replacement of the existing Bf 110. The final prototype, Fw 187 V6 (D-CINY), was more heavily modified, receiving the originally specified 736 kW (1,000 PS) DB 600 engines, as well as a new surface evaporative cooling system for reduced drag. First flown in early 1939 it proved to have serious cooling problems (in common with other designs using the system, like the Heinkel He 100) and suffered some skin buckling and distortion. Nevertheless, during a series of carefully timed and measured runs in October 1939, the Fw 187 V6 reached 634 km/h (395 mph) in level flight, making it the fastest fighter in Germany at the time. =Production run= A small production run of three Fw 187 A-0 followed in the summer of 1939, based upon the V3 prototype and using the Jumo 210G engines. The Luftwaffe, however, stated that without defensive armament the aircraft could not fulfill the Zerst√∂rer role, and remained uninterested in the design. The three two-seat prototypes were returned to Focke-Wulf after testing at Rechlin. There was a brief study in the winter of 1942/43 as a night fighter, but the lack of room in the cockpit for radar equipment quickly eliminated it from contention. After rejecting the design, the RLM \\"recycled\\" their 8-187 airframe number to Junkers for their Junkers Ju 187 dive bomber prototype. Tank nevertheless directed a series of studies based around new versions of the basic airframe in roles including dive bomber, night fighter, fighter-bomber, high-altitude interceptor (with greater wingspan and lengthened rear fuselage), among others. These designs explored a variety of engines including the Daimler-Benz DB 601, DB 605 and even the BMW 801 radial engine. In time the Ta 154 Moskito resulted from the Luftwaffe requirement for a twin-engine heavy fighter like the Fw 187, but constructed from wood instead of light alloys but due to the different material and construction techniques Tank made no use of the Fw 187 work, instead having to design a completely new aircraft to meet this requirement. Surviving Fw 187s were apparently used as flying test beds during this program. Operational history An Industrie-Schutzstaffel (Industry- Defense Squadron) comprising the three Fw 187 A-0s was manned by Focke-Wulf test-pilots in defense of the factory in Bremen. Although there are claims that they scored several kills, it is likely that these were propaganda claims. The three A-0s were even sent to Norway and promoted as evidence that the aircraft was entering service to replace the Bf 110 (a similar scheme employing prototype Panzer VIs was also carried out), but by this time any such plan was long dead. The pilots reportedly found the Fw 187 generally superior to the Bf 110 in almost all respects, but the RLM quickly withdrew them from service. They returned to Focke-Wulf, where they were again used for plant defense. One Fw 187 was sent to the aerial gunnery school in V√¶rl√∏se, Denmark in 1942.

FedExField is currently being considered as a 2026 FIFA World Cup venue. It is currently up against 16 other venues around the United States, including M&T; Bank Stadium in nearby Baltimore; the final list of 10 stadiums will be decided in 2020 or 2021.https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/world- cup/news/world-cup-2026-what-are-the-host-cities-in-usa-mexico-and-canada- going-to-be/ Criticisms During an NFL game, 2014 Many fans feel FedExField does not compare favorably with RFK Stadium. Sports Illustrateds rankings of \\"NFL Fan Value Experience\\" rated FedExField 28th out of 31 NFL stadiums. In January 2007, The Washington Post reported that team owner Daniel Snyder was meeting with Washington, D.C., officials about building a new stadium in order to return the team to the District. There were also reportedly meetings with Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe.http://blogs.nbc12.com/decisionvirginia/2014/08/mcauliffe-and- snyder-have-met-to-discuss-redskins-stadium.html Upper level seats, 2017 Problems were created when the design of the stadium was modified in an effort to maximize revenue. Over the years, \\"party zones\\" requiring paid membership (such as the Touchdown Club and Tailgate Club) have sprouted on the concourse outside the stadium. Entrances adjacent to the \\"party zones\\" are no longer accessible to fans who do not purchase a \\"party zone\\" membership. Installation of \\"Dream Seats\\" are another modification of the stadium that has increased revenue. The original architect calculated the lowest possible height at which the first row could be set in order to still see the field over the players standing on the sideline. In 2005, eight years after the stadium opened, 1,488 premium \\"dream seats\\" in three rows were added in front of what was the first row when the stadium was built. Because some of these seats are too low to see over the players on the sideline, occupants of these seats stand in order to see the game. In the 2011 off-season, nearly 10,000 seats were removed from the upper deck to reduce capacity to around 83,000, making FedExField the second-largest venue in the NFL during the 2011 season. A Redskins team official admitted that the seats were removed due to lack of demand.FedExField Official: Redskins Removed Seats They Couldn't Sell During the 2012 offseason, 4,000 additional seats were removed to make way for new suites and party decks and the stadium's capacity dropped to 79,000. The seats that were removed permit the team to continue to sell out and avoid the NFL television black-out rule. In December 2013, the Redskins set a record for the lowest announced attendance ever at FedExField with 56,247, most likely because of the team's poor record at the time and inclement weather. Attendance in the 2014 season averaged less than 78,000 per game, and never rose above 81,000. On June 1, 2015, The Washington Post reported that another 4,000 to 6,000 seats, primarily in the top eight rows of the upper decks, were tarped off using chain link fencing and tarps during the 2015 off-season. Team officials said the removals were made due to \\"season ticket holder feedback\\", and declined to say how exactly many seats had been removed. The location of the stadium has made traveling to it through public transportation difficult, inconvenient and time-consuming as residents and visitors in the region rely heavily on public transportation. The stadium is about a mile away from the Morgan Boulevard station, the nearest Metro station to the stadium. Furthermore, federal regulations prohibit publicly paid shuttle service from public transit agencies as long as a private service is available. Since this method is not cost effective, fans taking public transportation must walk to and from the stadium.

He was appointed to several minor roles before the revolution, but came to prominence as a member of William's government. Born to Roman Catholic parents, he remained in that faith until 1679 when‚Äîduring the time of the Popish Plot and following the advice of the divine John Tillotson‚Äîhe converted to the Church of England.Stuart Handley, ‚ÄòTalbot, Charles, duke of Shrewsbury (1660‚Äì1718)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008, accessed 30 Jan 2011. Shrewsbury took his seat in the House of Lords in 1680 and three years later was appointed Gentleman-Extraordinary of the Bedchamber, suggesting he was in favour at the court of Charles II. With the accession in 1685 of James II, Shrewsbury was appointed a captain in order to defeat the Monmouth rebellion, although he resigned his commission in 1687 after refusing to bow to pressure from James to convert back to the Catholic faith. Making contact with William of Orange, Shrewsbury's home became a meeting place for the opposition to James II and Shrewsbury was one of seven English statesmen to sign the invitation to William to invade England in June 1688. In September he fled England for Holland and returned with William to England in November. Shrewsbury was influential in the making of the Revolution Settlement, arguing strongly in favour of recognising William and Mary as sovereigns. Shrewsbury resigned from William's government in 1690 due to ill-health and his opposition to the dissolution of Parliament and the dropping of the Bill that would have required an oath abjuring James as King. In opposition, Shrewsbury contacted the exiled Stuart court in France as a prelude to a Stuart restoration. In 1694, Shrewsbury returned to government and was prominent in persuading the House of Commons to vote for the funds needed for William's war against France. Ill-health led to his resignation in 1698, but he returned to the government in 1699 until resigning again in 1700. From 1700 until 1705, Shrewsbury was in self-imposed exile abroad, visiting France, Switzerland, Italy, and marrying Countess Adelhida Paleotti. Upon his return to England, Shrewsbury concentrated on the construction of Heythrop Park. In April 1710 Shrewsbury return to government and was an early supporter of the Tory efforts to negotiate peace with France to end the War of the Spanish Succession, concerned at the negative financial impact it was having on landowners. However he was uncomfortable with peace negotiations that left out Britain's ally, the Dutch. In November 1712 he was appointed ambassador to France and then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, returning to England in June 1714. In July Shrewsbury was appointed Lord Treasurer but in August Queen Anne died and George I succeeded her. The new Whig regime opposed Shrewsbury remaining in government and by 1715 he had lost all his governmental offices, although until his death he remained George's Groom of the Stool. Shrewsbury opposed the Whigs' attack on the previous Tory ministers and opposed their other policies in the Lords, making contact with the Stuart Pretender and sending him money. He died of inflammation of the lungs in 1718. Early life He was the only son of the 11th Earl of Shrewsbury and his second wife, formerly Anna Maria Brudenell, a daughter of the 2nd Earl of Cardigan. His mother became the notorious mistress of the 2nd Duke of Buckingham, who killed her husband in a duel in 1668. It has been argued that the traumatic events of his early childhood left a permanent mark on him. Talbot was a godson of King Charles II, after whom he was named, and he was brought up as a Roman Catholic, but after the scandal of his father's death, he was placed in the care of Protestant relatives. In 1679, under the influence of John Tillotson, he became a member of the Church of England. James II and the Glorious Revolution On his father's death he succeeded to the Earldom of Shrewsbury, received an appointment in the household of Charles II, and served in the army under James II. Nonetheless, in 1687 he was in correspondence with the Prince of Orange, and he was one of the seven signatories of the letter of invitation to William in the following year. He contributed towards defraying the expenses of the projected invasion, and having crossed to Holland to join William, he landed with him in England in November 1688 during the Glorious Revolution. William III Shrewsbury became Secretary of State for the Southern Department in the first administration of William and Mary, succeeding his uncle the Earl of Middleton, but he resigned from office in 1690, when the Tories gained the upper hand in parliament. While in opposition he brought forward the Triennial Bill, to which the King initially refused assent. In 1694 he again became Secretary of State; but there is evidence that as early as 1690, when he resigned, he had made overtures to the Jacobites and was in correspondence with James at his court in exile at Saint Germains, though it has been stated on the other hand that these relations were entered upon with William's full connivance, for reasons of policy. Others aver that Shrewsbury himself was unaware of the King's knowledge and toleration, which would explain the terrified letters he was in the habit of penning to him. However this may be, William affected to have no suspicion of Shrewsbury's loyalty, although often presented with evidence against him. On 30 April 1694 Shrewsbury was created Marquess of Alton and Duke of Shrewsbury, and he acted as one of the regents during the King's absence from England in the two following years. In 1696 definite accusations of treason were brought against him by Sir John Fenwick, which William immediately communicated to Shrewsbury; and about this time the Secretary of State took but a small part in public business, again professing his anxiety to resign. His plea of ill-health was a genuine one, and in 1700 the King reluctantly consented to his retirement into private life. Exile For the next seven years Shrewsbury lived abroad, chiefly at Rome, whence in 1701 he wrote a celebrated letter to Lord Somers expressing his abhorrence of public life and declaring that if he had a son he \\"would sooner bind him to a cobbler than a courtier, and a hangman than a statesman.\\" Lord Chamberlain and Lord Treasurer Shrewsbury in the robes of the Order of the Garter, holding his staff of office as Lord Chamberlain, a post he held 1699-1700 for William III and again 1710-1715 for Anne and for George I. On the accession of Queen Anne the Whig leaders made an ineffectual attempt to persuade Shrewsbury to return to office. He returned at last to England on 30 December 1705, and took his seat in the House of Lords in January 1706. He gradually became alienated from his old political associates, and in 1710 he accepted the post of Lord Chamberlain in the Tory administration, to which the queen appointed him without the knowledge of Godolphin and Marlborough; his wife was at the same time made a Lady of the Bedchamber. After a diplomatic mission to France for the purpose of negotiating preliminaries of peace, Shrewsbury became Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1713; but he was in London in July 1714 during the memorable crisis occasioned by the impending death of Queen Anne. On 29 July, when the queen was dying, the Earl of Oxford received his long-delayed dismissal from the office of Lord Treasurer. On 30 July, Shrewsbury and other ministers assembled at Kensington Palace and, being admitted to the queen's bedchamber, Bolingbroke recommended the appointment of Shrewsbury to the vacant treasurership; Anne at once placed the staff of that high office in the duke's hands. He was to be the very last person to hold that position but the first to have been Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Lord Chamberlain and Lord Treasurer at the same time. Accession of George I Thus, when the queen died on 1 August, Shrewsbury was in a position of supreme power with reference to the momentous question of the succession to the crown. He threw his influence into the scale in favour of the Elector of Hanover, and was powerfully influential in bringing about the peaceful accession of George I, and in defeating the design of the Jacobites to place the son of James II on the throne. His disinclination for the highest political offices remained, however, as great as before; and having resigned the lord-treasurership and the lord-lieutenancy of Ireland, he was appointed Lord Chamberlain. This place he resigned in July 1715. He died at his London home, Warwick House, Charing Cross, on 1 February 1718, from inflammation of the lungs, aged fifty-seven. He was buried in the family tomb at the parish church of Albrighton (near Wolverhampton), Shropshire. Legacy The Duke of Shrewsbury was one of the greatest noblemen of the reign of Queen Anne. Though blind in one eye, he was strikingly handsome in person, his demeanour was dignified and his manners full of grace and courtesy. Swift described him as \\"the finest gentleman we have\\", and as \\"the favourite of the nation\\", while William III spoke of him as \\"the King of Hearts\\". Like most of his contemporaries he endeavoured to keep himself in favour both with the exiled house of Stuart and with the reigning sovereign in England; but at the two critical junctures of 1688 and 1714 he acted decisively in favour of the Protestant succession. At other times he appeared weak and vacillating, and he never wholeheartedly supported either Whigs or Tories, though he co-operated with each in turn. His magnanimous disposition saved him from the vindictiveness of the party politician of the period; and the weak health from which he suffered through life probably combined with a congenital lack of ambition to prevent his grasping the power which his personality and talents might have placed in his hands. Marriage Adelhida Paleotti became Charles Talbot's wife in 1705. In 1705 Shrewsbury married, at Augsburg, Bavaria, Adelhida Paleotti, daughter of the Marquis Andrea Paleotti by his second wife Maria Cristina Dudley, fifth daughter of Carlo Dudley, titular Duke of Northumberland (himself son of Sir Robert Dudley (1574-1649), an Englishman turned member of the Tuscan nobility).Robert Dudley was the illegitimate son of Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, by his high-born mistress Douglas Sheffield nee Howard. Both Lady Sheffield and Leicester married other parties by 1679, which damaged Robert Dudley's efforts to have his legitimacy recognized. He was recognized by Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor as Duke of Northumberland in 1620, but was debarred by illegitimacy from all the Dudley family titles. He married three times, secondly circa 1595/6 Alice Leigh, whom he deserted by 1605, and lastly (bigamously) 1606 by Catholic rites to his mistress and first cousin twice removed Elizabeth Southwell (died 1631 in childbirth), daughter of Sir Robert Southwell and Lady Elizabeth Howard, granddaughter of Robert Dudley's maternal uncle Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham. His deserted wife was created Duchess of Dudley in 1644 for life by Charles I, who also made Robert Dudley legitimate. However, the Dudley titles (Leicester and Warwick) and estates had passed elsewhere in the reign of James I. His children were 1. Alice Dudley, 2. Douglas Dudley, 3. Catherine Leveson, nee Dudley, 4. Frances Kniveton nee Dudley, 5. Anne Dudley (all probably by his 2nd wife Alice Leigh), and then by his 3rd \\"wife\\" Elizabeth Southwell (married 1606 by Catholic rites) 6. Maria, Princess of Piombino; 7. Carlo, Duke of Northumbria (maternal grandfather of Adelhida Talbot, Duchess of Shrewsbury), 8. Ambrogio Dudley (named for Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick, 9. Ferdinando Dudley, 10. Teresa, Duchess of Cornia, 11. Cosimo Dudley, 12. Maria Christina, Marchesa Clivola, 13. Maria Maddalena, Marchesa Malaspina, 14. Antonio Dudley, 15. Enrico Dudley, 16. Anna Dudley, 17. Giovanni Dudley, and 18. daughter (born 1631), who became Duchess de Castillion del Lago This lady, who is said to have had \\"a great many engaging qualities\\" besides many accomplishments, was the subject of much malicious gossip. She was the widow, or as some declared, the mistress of a Count Brachiano; and Lady Cowper reported that the lady's brother had forced Shrewsbury to marry her \\"after an intrigue together\\". After Shrewsbury's return to England the duchess became conspicuous in London society, where the caustic wit of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu was exercised at her expense. She won the favour of Queen Anne, after the death of Prince George of Denmark, by her impulsive comment: \\"Oh my poor Queen I see how much you do miss your dear husband\\". During the Paris embassy she became extremely popular, due to her hospitality and lively conversation. Saint Simon thought that her eccentricity bordered on madness, but he did praise the simple, practical hairstyle which she made fashionable. On the accession of George I the Duchess of Shrewsbury became a lady of the bedchamber to the Princess of Wales, a position which she retained till her death on 29 June 1726. Shrewsbury left no children, and at his death the dukedom became extinct, the earldom of Shrewsbury passing to his cousin Gilbert Talbot. Gilbert was a Roman Catholic priest living abroad and on his death in 1744 the titles and estates devolved on his brother George.

He was created Baron Villiers and Viscount Villiers in 1691 and Earl of Jersey in 1697. A leading Tory politician opposed to the Whig Junto, he was made Southern Secretary in 1699. He persuaded the young writer and diplomat Matthew Prior to abandon his former Whig allies and vote for the impeachment of his fellow Kit Cat Club member and patron Lord Halifax. Jersey replaced Halifax as Prior's patron. Origins He was the son of Sir Edward Villiers (1620‚Äì1689) of Richmond, Surrey, by his wife Frances Howard, the youngest daughter of Theophilus Howard, 2nd Earl of Suffolk and Elizabeth Home. His grandfather was Sir Edward Villiers (c. 1585‚Äì1626), Master of the Mint and Lord President of Munster who was half brother of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham and of Christopher Villiers, 1st Earl of Anglesey. His sister was Elizabeth Villiers, the mistress of King William III, and was later Countess of Orkney as the wife of George Hamilton, 1st Earl of Orkney.

In 457 BC the Athenians had taken control of Boeotia at the Battle of Oenophyta, and spent the next ten years attempting to consolidate the League's power. In 454 BC Athens lost a fleet attempting to aid an Egyptian revolt against Persia; fearing revolts by the other members of the Delian League, Athens moved the treasury to their city from Delos in 453 BC, and signed the Peace of Callias with Persia around 450 BC. The Delian League was essentially an Athenian empire, and while Athens was usually successful at holding their possessions in the Aegean Sea, they were less successful on land. By 447 BC some of the men exiled from Boeotia after the Athenian victory there in 457 had returned home and began to take back some of the Boeotian towns. The Athenians under Tolmides, with 1,000 hoplites plus other troops from their allies, marched into Boeotia to take back the recaptured towns. They captured Chaeronea, but were attacked and defeated by the Boeotians at Coronea. The Athenians were forced to give up control of Boeotia. Boeotia was allowed to leave the Delian League in return for allowing the Athenians to leave Boeotia safely. The defeat led to revolts on Euboea and in Megara, which in turn led to further conflict with Sparta, contributing to the Peloponnesian War.

Early life Charles was born into the Noble House of Montagu. He was the eldest son of the former Anne Yelverton and Robert Montagu, 3rd Earl of Manchester. Revised by Matthew Kilburn as of May 2010. Among his siblings were Lady Anne Montagu (wife of James Howard, 3rd Earl of Suffolk) and politicians the Hon. Robert Montagu and the Hon. Heneage Montagu, both MPs for Huntingdonshire. After his father's death in 1683, his mother married Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax. His paternal grandparents were Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester and his second wife Lady Anne Rich (a daughter of Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick). His maternal grandparents were Sir Christopher Yelverton, 1st Baronet of Easton Maudit and Anne Twysden (daughter of Sir William Twysden, 1st Baronet). He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, and succeeded to his father's earldom in 1683. Warmly sympathizing with the Whig revolution of 1688, he attended William and Mary at their coronation, and fought under William at the Boyne. Career In 1697, he was sent as an Envoy to Venice to try to procure the release of British sailors, but the Venetians proved unwilling to negotiate. On his return in 1698, he was appointed a privy councillor. The following year he was sent as English Ambassador to France, remaining there until the outbreak of war in 1701. He was then briefly appointed Secretary of State for the Southern Department, a post he held between January and May 1702. He was then out of office until again sent to Venice, as Ambassador, but during his time there in 1707 and 1708, this negotiations (to persuade Venice to adhere to the Grand Alliance) were again unsuccessful. In 1714, he received an appointment in the household of George I, by whom on 28 April 1719 he was created Duke of Manchester. In 1719, he was one of the main subscribers to the Royal Academy of Music, a corporation that produced baroque opera on the stage. He also served as High Steward of the University of Cambridge from 1697 to 1722. Personal life On 19 February 1690, Lord Manchester was married the Hon. Doddington Greville (1671‚Äì1720). She was a daughter of Robert Greville, 4th Baron Brooke of Beauchamps Court and Anne (n√©e Doddington) Greville (who married Thomas Hoby after the death of Lord Brooke in 1676).

He served as Secretary of State for Scotland, the Northern Department and the Southern Department, before acting as Jacobite Secretary of State and chief advisor to James II and then his son James III during their exile in France. Life Charles Middleton was born around 1650, the only son of John Middleton, 1st Earl of Middleton, and his first wife Grizel Durham. He had two elder sisters, Helen and Grizel. Originally from Kincardineshire, in the first part of the 1638 to 1651 Wars of the Three Kingdoms, John Middleton supported the Covenanters, who appointed him commander-in-chief in 1644. After switching sides in 1648, he accompanied Charles II into exile, and Charles grew up in exile, returning home in the 1660 Restoration. His father died in 1674 leaving him little except for the title and debts; in 1683, Charles married Lady Catherine Brudenell, (1648-1743), daughter of the Catholic Earl of Cardigan. They had four children; John (1683-1746), Katherine (1685-1763), Charles (1688-1738), and Elizabeth (1690-1773). Middleton was described by Gilbert Burnet as ‚Äòa man of generous temper, but without much religion‚Äô; he remained a Protestant until 1701, when he converted to Catholicism at the request of the dying James II. Career Middleton is thought to have spent 1669 to 1671 in France and Italy; in 1673, he was commissioned as a captain in the 3rd Foot, later the Buffs, which served in the 1672-1678 Franco-Dutch War as part of the Dutch Scots Brigade. By 1678, he was a Lieutenant-Colonel and governor of Bruges. Shortly after this, he was suggested as Secretary of State for Scotland, in place of the Duke of Lauderdale. This went to Alexander Stuart, 5th Earl of Moray and in June 1680, Middleton was made envoy to Emperor Leopold I. He returned to Scotland in July 1681, where he became a close associate of James and his wife Mary of Modena. He was appointed to the Scottish Privy Council and made joint Secretary of State for Scotland with Moray on 26 September 1682. In 1684, he relocated to London and joined the English Privy Council in July and Secretary of State for the Northern Department in August. After James succeeded as king in February 1685, he was elected for Winchelsea and given the task of managing the House of Commons. Parliament was suspended for refusing to repeal the Test Act, while James' reliance on a small circle of Catholics made Middleton suspect as one of the few remaining Protestants. He was present at the birth of the Prince of Wales in June 1688 and became Secretary of State for the Southern Department in September 1688. When James fled to France after the November 1688 Glorious Revolution, he remained in England; in 1692, he was held in the Tower of London for plotting to restore him and after his release, joined the exiled court at Saint-Germain. He proposed a more moderate declaration for a Jacobite restoration than James' chief advisor and Secretary of State, John Drummond, 1st Earl of Melfort. He became joint Secretary of State with Melfort, responsible for correspondence with England and Scotland, and became sole Secretary of State after Melfort was dismissed in June 1694. In England, he was tried for treason and outlawed on 23 July 1694, and attainted on 2 July 1695. He continued as Secretary until James' death in September 1701, when he was appointed to the Regency Council during the minority of his son, James III. Despite his wish to resign, he was persuaded to remain in office and made the Earl of Monmouth in the Jacobite peerage. With his two sons, Middleton accompanied James in 1708 during the attempted Franco-Jacobite landing in Scotland and allowed to resign as Secretary in 1713. He briefly joined James in Scotland during the 1715 Rising, before returning to France, where he served as Mary's Lord Chamberlain until her death in 1718. Granted a pension by the French government, he died on 9 August 1719 and was buried at the parish church of Saint-Germain.

He also sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1621 and 1629. He served as secretary to Edward la Zouche and the Duke of Buckingham in the Admiraltyand became a clerk of the Privy Council. He supported the Royalist cause in the English Civil War and accompanied the court into exile, before assuming the post of Secretary of State on the Restoration. Life Nicholas was the eldest son of John Nicholas of a Wiltshire family. He was educated at Salisbury grammar school, Winchester College and Queen's College, Oxford. After studying law at the Middle Temple, in 1618 Nicholas became secretary to Edward la Zouche, 11th Baron Zouche, lord warden and admiral of the Cinque Ports. In 1621 he was elected as a Member of Parliament for Winchelsea. He was re-elected as one of the Members for Winchelsea in 1624 for what became known as the Happy Parliament. Nicholas kept diaries of all the parliaments in which he sat. When Zouche resigned his office of lord warden to the Duke of Buckingham, the Duke, upon Zouche's recommendation, on 9 December 1624 appointed Nicholas as his secretary for the business of the Cinque Ports. In 1625 Nicholas became the first holder of the office of Secretary to the Admiralty; shortly afterwards he was appointed an extra clerk of the privy council, with duties relating to Admiralty business. In 1628 he was elected a Member for Dover and sat until 1629, when King Charles decided to rule without parliament and in the event did so for eleven years. Appended to a copy of Charles's speech at the dissolution of this parliament on 10 March 1629 is a poem of twenty-four verses in Nicholas's hand, beginning: > :The wisest king did wonder when he spide :The nobles march on foot, their > vassals ride :His majestie may wonder now to see :Some that would needs be > king as well as he. From 1635 to 1641 Nicholas was one of the clerks in ordinary to the council. In this situation he had much business to transact in connection with the levy of ship-money. When in 1641 King Charles I went to Scotland, he remained in London and was responsible for keeping the king informed of the proceedings of parliament. When Charles returned to London, Nicholas was knighted and appointed a privy councillor and a Secretary of State, in which capacity he attended the king while the court was at Oxford and carried out the business of the Treaty of Uxbridge. Throughout the Civil War, Nicholas was one of Charles's wisest and most loyal advisers. He arranged the details of the king's surrender to the Scots, although he does not appear to have advised or even to have approved of the step. He also had the duty of treating for the capitulation of Oxford, which included permission for Nicholas himself to retire abroad with his family. He went to France, being recommended by the king to the confidence of the Prince of Wales. In 1648 Nicholas wrote a pamphlet, An Apology for the Honorable Nation of the Jews, which called for the readmission of the Jews to England. It is one of the few examples of pro- admission writing that does not also call for the conversion of the Jews and is cited by Menasseh Ben Israel in his Humble Addresses, although Cecil Roth wonders whether the pamphlet might actually have been written by a Jew.Scult, Mel (1978). Millennial Expectations and Jewish Liberties: A Study of the Efforts to Convert the Jews in Britain, Up to the Mid Nineteenth Century. Brill Archive. pps.27. After the king's death, Nicholas remained on the continent, concerting measures on behalf of the exiled Charles II with Hyde and other royalists, but the hostility of Queen Henrietta Maria deprived him of any real influence in the counsels of the young sovereign. He lived at the Hague and elsewhere in a state of poverty which hampered his power to serve Charles, but which the latter did nothing to relieve. Charles appointed him secretary of state while in exile in 1654. As an enthusiastic Royalist, in a letter dated 10 September 1657 to Sir Edward Hyde, Nicholas speaks of Cromwell, > ... I conceive his Majesty should do well to set a good price on his head > and all the heads of the chief commanders in Ireland and also in Scotland > ...'The Nicholas Papers, Vol IV' p.13, London: Offices of the Society, 1920 West Horsley Place Nicholas returned to England at the Restoration and duly took office as Secretary of State along with William Morice, a former parliamentary supporter. Nicholas was soon retired, much against his own wishes, in favour of Charles's favourite Henry Bennet. He received a grant of money and the offer of a peerage, which he felt too poor to accept. He retired to a country seat in Surrey (the manor of West Horsley) which he purchased from Carew Raleigh, son of Sir Walter Raleigh, and there he lived till his death in 1669. Family Nicholas married Jane Jay, a daughter of Henry Jay, an alderman of London and had several sons and daughters. His eldest son was Sir John Nicholas, a Clerk of the Signet and Clerk of the Privy Council. His daughter Susannah married as his second wife the Irish statesman George Lane, 1st Viscount Lanesborough: like her father he spent years in exile with Charles II, and by 1659 the couple were almost destitute, but was well rewarded after the Restoration. Susannah died in 1671. His younger brother Matthew Nicholas (1594‚Äì1661) was successively Dean of Bristol, canon of Westminster and Dean of St Paul's. His country seat was at Sunninghill in Berkshire. Correspondence The collected correspondences of Nicholas were published in three volumes by the Royal Historical Society in 1920.

It is the first animated short starring the Pink Panther. The short won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short at the 37th Academy Awards. Plot The Pink Panther and an unnamed painter (known as the \\"Little Man\\") compete over whether a house should be painted blue or pink. Each time the painter attempts to paint something blue, the panther thwarts him in a new way, and paints the object/area pink. At the end, the exasperated painter inadvertently turns the house and everything around it pink (first by repeatedly shooting at the elusive panther with a shotgun that the panther had poured pink paint into, and then by burying the panther's pink paint cans in the soil outside the house, where they \\"sprout\\" and grow pink grass and trees), and the panther moves in. But just before he moves in, he paints the white man completely pink. The painter gets upset and bangs his head against the mailbox outside.

Southern Secretary Caricature of George Bubb Dodington and Sir Thomas Robinson In 1754 Robinson was appointed Secretary of State for the Southern Department and Leader of the House of Commons by the prime minister, the Duke of Newcastle, and it was on this occasion that Pitt made the famous remark to Fox, \\"the duke might as well have sent us his jackboot to lead us.\\" In November 1755 he resigned, and in April 1761 he was created Baron Grantham. Later career He was Master of the Great Wardrobe 1749‚Äì1754 and again 1755‚Äì1760, and was joint Postmaster- General in 1765 and 1766. He died in London on 30 September 1770. He married Frances, daughter of Thomas Worsley of Hovingham, on 13 July 1737, and had two sons and six daughters. He was succeeded in the peerage by his eldest son, Thomas. The town of Grantham, New Hampshire in the United States of America is named after Robinson.

In a joking reference to their predilection for painting views of the vernacular architecture, group member Childe Hassam nicknamed the art colony \\"the Cos Cob Clapboard School of Art.\\"Larkin (2001), page 234 History Artists had been coming to Greenwich to paint since the 1870s, but the art colony began to form when John Henry Twachtman settled in Greenwich in 1889. The town was only a short train ride from New York City, yet retained a rural character that appealed to artists. Many of Twachtman's friends came to visit him at his home; among them were Hassam, J. Alden Weir, Theodore Robinson, Henry Fitch Taylor, and Robert Reid. For longer stays, they boarded at the Holley House (now known as the Bush-Holley House), a rambling old saltbox overlooking Cos Cob's small harbor. Old Holley House, Cos Cob by John Henry Twachtman (1890-1900) During the winter, Twachtman and Weir taught at the Art Students League of New York. Probably beginning in 1890, Twachtman established summer art classes in Cos Cob; Weir taught with him in 1892 and 1893. Many of the summer students were enrolled at the Art Students League. Among the artists who first visited Cos Cob as summer students were Elmer Livingston MacRae, Ernest Lawson, Allen Tucker, Charles Ebert, Mary Roberts Ebert, Alice Judson, and Genjiro Yeto. Other artists associated with the Cos Cob art colony include Leonard Ochtman, Mina Fonda Ochtman, Dorothy Ochtman, Edward Clark Potter, Emil Carlsen, George Wharton Edwards, and Kerr Eby. The art colony also included many writers and editors, including Lincoln Steffens and Willa Cather. Members of the Cos Cob art colony were deeply involved in organizing the Armory Show, the exhibition that in 1913 introduced modernist European art to a vast American audience. The art colony formed its own hometown organization in 1911. The Greenwich Society of Artists (now the Greenwich Art Society) held its first exhibition in 1912 at the Bruce Museum, which opened to the public for the first time on that occasion.

Symptoms may include pain, swelling, and redness. There may also be drainage of fluid, but rarely a fever. Risk factors include obesity, family history, prolonged sitting, greater amounts of hair, and not enough exercise. The underlying mechanism is believed to involve a mechanical process. The lesions may contain hair and skin debris. Diagnosis is based on symptoms and examination. If there is infection, treatment is generally by incision and drainage just off the midline. Shaving the area may prevent recurrence. More extensive surgery may be required if the disease recurs. Antibiotics are usually not needed. Without treatment the condition may remain long term. About 3 per 10,000 people per year are affected, and it occurs more often in males than females. Young adults are most commonly affected. The term \\"pilonidal\\" means \\"nest of hair\\". The condition was first described in 1833. Signs and symptoms Two pilonidal cysts that have formed in the gluteal cleft Pilonidal cysts are itchy and often very painful, and typically occur between the ages of 15 and 35. Although usually found near the coccyx, the condition can also affect the navel, armpit or genital region, though these locations are much rarer. Signs and symptoms may include: *Intermittent pain/discomfort or swelling above the anus or near the tailbone *Opaque yellow (purulent) or bloody discharge from the tailbone area *Unexpected moisture in the tailbone region *Discomfort sitting on the tailbone, doing sit-ups or riding a bicycle‚Äîany activities that roll over the tailbone area Some people with a pilonidal cyst will be asymptomatic. = Pilonidal sinus = Pilonidal sinus (PNS): is a sinus tract, or small channel, that may originate from the source of infection and open to the surface of the skin. Material from the cyst drains through the pilonidal sinus. A pilonidal cyst is usually painful, but with draining the patient might not feel pain.  Causes  One proposed cause of pilonidal cysts is ingrown hair, although hairs found in pilonidal sinus tracts may originate from the head. Excessive sitting is thought to predispose people to the condition, as sitting increases pressure on the coccygeal region. Trauma is not believed to cause a pilonidal cyst; however, such an event may result in inflammation of an existing cyst; there are cases where this can occur months after a localized injury to the area. Some researchers have proposed that pilonidal cysts may be caused by a congenital pilonidal dimple. Excessive sweating can also contribute to the formation of a pilonidal cyst: moisture can fill a stretched hair follicle, which helps create a low-oxygen environment that promotes the growth of anaerobic bacteria, often found in pilonidal cysts. The presence of bacteria and low oxygen levels hamper wound healing and exacerbate a forming pilonidal cyst. Differential diagnosis Relative incidence of cutaneous cysts. Pilonidal cyst is labeled near top. A pilonidal cyst can resemble a dermoid cyst, a kind of teratoma (germ cell tumor). In particular, a pilonidal cyst in the gluteal cleft can resemble a sacrococcygeal teratoma. Correct diagnosis is important because all teratomas require consultation with an oncologist and complete surgical excision, if possible without any spillage.  Treatment  If there is infection, treatment is generally by incision and drainage just off the midline. The evidence or elective treatment of pilonidal sinus disease is poor. The most commonly performed surgery is for the pilonidal sinus complex to be surgically excised with the wound often left open to heal. Post-surgical wound packing may be necessary, and packing typically must be replaced daily for 4 to 8 weeks. In some cases, two years may be required for complete granulation to occur. Sometimes the cyst is resolved via surgical marsupialization. Surgeons can also excise the sinus and repair with a reconstructive flap technique, such as a \\"cleft lift\\" procedure or Z-plasty, usually done under general anesthetic. This approach is especially useful for complicated or recurring pilonidal disease, leaves little scar tissue and flattens the region between the buttocks, reducing the risk of recurrence. This approach typically results in a more rapid recovery than the traditional surgery, however there are fewer surgeons trained in the cleft lift procedure and it consequently may not be as accessible to patients, depending on their location. Meta-analysis shows recurrence rates were lower in open healing than with primary closure (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.87), at the expense of healing time. Pilonidal cysts can recur, and do so more frequently if the surgical wound is sutured in the midline, as opposed to away from the midline, which obliterates the natal cleft and removes the focus of shearing stress. An incision lateral to the intergluteal cleft is therefore preferred, especially given the poor healing of midline incisions in this region. Minimally invasive techniques with no wound and rapid return to full activities have been reported but await double blind randomised trials. Nevertheless, outcomes on a number of patients are excellent, especially when coupling the sound principles of John Bascom to the employment of biopsy punches [technique developed by Dr. Basso in Rome (Italy), see miniatures below]. Another technique is to treat pilonidal sinus with fibrin glue. This technique is of unclear benefit as of 2017 due to insufficient research. The evidence for any treatment is of low quality, and care must be taken not to over interpret any study in this field.

The condition was first described by Herbert Mayo in 1833. R.M. Hodges was the first to use the phrase pilonidal cyst to describe the condition in 1880. The condition was widespread in the United States Army during World War II. The condition was termed \\"Jeep seat\\" or \\"Jeep riders' disease\\", because a large portion of people who were being hospitalized for it rode in Jeeps, and prolonged rides in the bumpy vehicles were believed to have caused the condition due to irritation and pressure on the coccyx.

(2013). pp. 156-7. Studies in Polish and Comparative Law: A Symposium of Twelve Articles. London: Forgotten Books. (Original work published 1945)  Catholic Church view of the importance of marriage  The Catechism of the Catholic Church states: \\"The intimate community of life and love which constitutes the married state has been established by the Creator and endowed by him with its own proper laws. . . . God himself is the author of marriage. The vocation to marriage is written in the very nature of man and woman as they came from the hand of the Creator. Marriage is not a purely human institution despite the many variations it may have undergone through the centuries in different cultures, social structures, and spiritual attitudes. These differences should not cause us to forget its common and permanent characteristics. Although the dignity of this institution is not transparent everywhere with the same clarity, some sense of the greatness of the matrimonial union exists in all cultures. The well-being of the individual person and of both human and Christian society is closely bound up with the healthy state of conjugal and family life.\\" It also says: \\"The Church attaches great importance to Jesus' presence at the wedding at Cana. She sees in it the confirmation of the goodness of marriage and the proclamation that thenceforth marriage will be an efficacious sign of Christ's presence. In his preaching Jesus unequivocally taught the original meaning of the union of man and woman as the Creator willed it from the beginning: permission given by Moses to divorce one's wife was a concession to the hardness of hearts. The matrimonial union of man and woman is indissoluble; God himself has determined it, 'what therefore God has joined together, let no man put asunder'. This unequivocal insistence on the indissolubility of the marriage bond may have left some perplexed and could seem to be a demand impossible to realize. However, Jesus has not placed on spouses a burden impossible to bear, or too heavy ‚Äì heavier than the Law of Moses. By coming to restore the original order of creation disturbed by sin, he himself gives the strength and grace to live marriage in the new dimension of the Reign of God.\\" History of marriage in the Catholic Church =Early period= Mosaic depicting the wedding feast in Cana Marriage was considered a necessary passage into adulthood, and strongly supported within the Jewish faith. The author of the letter to the Hebrews declared that marriage should be held in honour among all, and early Christians defended the holiness of marriage against the Gnostics and the Antinomians.Michael G. Lawler, Marriage and Sacrament (Liturgical Press 1993 ), p. 54 At the same time, some in the emerging Christian communities began to prize the celibate state higher than marriage, taking the model of Jesus as guide. This was related to a widespread belief about the imminent coming of the Kingdom of God; and thus the exhortation by Jesus to avoid earthly ties. The apostle Paul in his letters also suggested a preference for celibacy, but recognized that not all Christians necessarily had the ability to live such a life: \\"Now as a concession, not a command, I say this. I wish that all were as I myself am. But each has his own gift from God, one of one kind and one of another. To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is good for them to remain single as I am. But if they cannot exercise self-control, they should marry. For it is better to marry than to burn with passion.\\" This teaching suggested that marriage be used only as a last resort by those Christians who found it too difficult to exercise a level of self-control and remain chaste, not having the gift of celibacy.Reay Tannahill, Sex in history, Abacus Armstrong has argued that to a significant degree, early Christians \\"placed less value on the family\\" and saw celibacy and freedom from family ties as a preferable state for those capable of it.Karen Armstrong, Christianity's creation of the sex war in the west, London, 1986 Nevertheless, this is tempered by other scholars who state Paul would no more impose celibacy than insist on marriage. What people instinctively choose manifests God's gift. Thus, he takes for granted that the married are not called to celibacy.Brown, Raymond E. S.S., Fitzmyer, Joseph A. S.J., Murphy, Roland E., O.Carm., Eds., The New Jerome Biblical Commentary, p. 804, Prentice-Hall, 1990, As the Church developed as an institution and came into contact with the Greek world, it reinforced the idea found in writers such as Plato and Aristotle that the celibate unmarried state was preferable and more holy than the married one. At the same time, it challenged some of the prevalent social norms such as the buying and selling of women into marriage, and defended the right of women to choose to remain unmarried virgins for the sake of Christ. The stories associated with the many virgin martyrs in the first few centuries of the Catholic Church often make it clear that they were martyred for their refusal to marry, not necessarily simply their belief in Christ. The teaching on the superiority of virginity over marriage expressed by Saint Paul was accepted by the early Church, as shown in the 2nd-century Shepherd of Hermas. Justin Martyr, writing in the middle of the 2nd century, boasted of the \\"many men and women of sixty and seventy years of age who from their childhood have been the disciples of Christ, and have kept themselves uncorrupted\\". Virginity was praised by Cyprian (c. 200 ‚Äì 258) and other prominent Christian figures and leaders. Philip Schaff admits that it cannot be denied that the later doctrine of the 16th century Council of Trent ‚Äì \\"that it is more blessed to remain virgin or celibate than to be joined in marriage\\" ‚Äì was the view that dominated the whole of the early Christian church. At the same time, the Church still discouraged anyone who would \\"condemn marriage, or abominate and condemn a woman who is a believer and devout, and sleeps with her own husband, as though she could not enter the Kingdom [of heaven]\\".Philip Schaff, Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers (Cosimo 2007 ), p. 92 For much of the history of the Catholic Church, no specific ritual was therefore prescribed for celebrating a marriage ‚Äì at least not until the late medieval period: \\"Marriage vows did not have to be exchanged in a church, nor was a priest's presence required. A couple could exchange consent anywhere, anytime.\\" =Church Fathers= Marriage without religious rite Markus notes this impact on the early Christian attitude, particularly as Christian anxiety about sex intensified after 400: \\"The superiority of virginity and sexual abstinence was generally taken for granted. But a dark undercurrent of hostility to sexuality and marriage became interwoven with the more benign attitudes towards the body. Attitudes diverged, and mainstream Christianity became infected with a pronounced streak of distrust towards bodily existence and sexuality. This permanent 'encratite' tendency was given powerful impetus in the debates about Christian perfection at the end of the fourth and the beginning of the fifth centuries.\\"John McManners (editor), The Oxford History of Christianity, University of Oxford, 2002, pp. 69-70 While the Church Fathers of the Latin or Catholic Church did not condemn marriage, they nevertheless taught a preference for celibacy and virginity. Bishop Ignatius of Antioch, writing around 110 to Bishop Polycarp of Smyrna said, \\"[I]t becomes both men and women who marry to form their union with the approval of the bishop, that their marriage may be according to God, and not after their own lust.\\" Tertullian (c. 160 ‚Äì c. 225) noted as early as the second century in his work \\"Ad Uxorem\\" that Christians were \\"requesting marriage\\" from their priests, and he was satisfied how a priestly blessing could transform a sinful act into a sanctified one; provided it was sanctified in moderation and only if children might be born of it. However, he also argued that a second marriage, involving someone freed from the first by the death of a spouse, \\"will have to be termed no other than a species of fornication\\", an argument based partly on the reasoning that such involves desiring to marry a woman out of sexual ardor.An Exhortation to Chastity, Chapter IX ‚Äì Second Marriage a Species of Adultery, Marriage Itself Impugned, as Akin to Adultery In his On Exhortation to Chastity Tertullian argued that a second marriage, after someone has been freed from the first by the death of a spouse, \\"will have to be termed no other than a species of fornication\\". Claiming to find in the Book of Leviticus a prohibition of remarriage by the priests of the Old Law similar to that for Christian clergy in the Pauline pastoral epistles,; he used it as an argument against remarrying even on the part of lay Christians, whom Christ made \\"a kingdom, priests to his God and Father\\": \\"If you are a digamist, do you baptize? If you are a digamist, do you offer? How much more capital (a crime) is it for a digamist laic to act as a priest, when the priest himself, if he turn digamist, is deprived of the power of acting the priest! 'But to necessity', you say, 'indulgence is granted'. No necessity is excusable which is avoidable. In a word, shun to be found guilty of digamy, and you do not expose yourself to the necessity of administering what a digamist may not lawfully administer. God wills us all to be so conditioned, as to be ready at all times and places to undertake (the duties of) His sacraments.\\" In his earlier Ad uxorem also, Tertullian argued against second marriages, but said that, if one must remarry, it should be with a Christian. In other writings, he argued strongly against ideas like those he expressed in his On Exhortation to Chastity; and in his De anima he explicitly stated that \\"the married state is blessed, not cursed by God\\". Adh√©mar d'Al√®s has commented: \\"Tertullian wrote a lot about marriage, and on no other subject has he contradicted himself as much.\\"Tertullian, translated by William P. Le Saint, Treatises on Marriage and Remarriage (Paulist Press 1951 ), p. 41 Cyprian (c. 200 ‚Äì 258), Bishop of Carthage, recommended in his Three Books of Testimonies against the Jews that Christians should not marry pagans. Addressing consecrated virgins he wrote: \\"The first decree commanded to increase and to multiply; the second enjoined continency. While the world is still rough and void, we are propagated by the fruitful begetting of numbers, and we increase to the enlargement of the human race. Now, when the world is filled and the earth supplied, they who can receive continency, living after the manner of eunuchs, are made eunuchs unto the kingdom. Nor does the Lord command this, but He exhorts it; nor does He impose the yoke of necessity, since the free choice of the will is left.\\"Karen Armstrong,The Gospel According to Woman: Christianity's creation of the sex war in the west, London, 1986 Jerome (c. 347 ‚Äì 420) commenting on Paul's letter to the Corinthians wrote: \\"If 'it is good for a man not to touch a woman', then it is bad for him to touch one, for bad, and bad only, is the opposite of good. But, if though bad, it is made venial, then it is allowed to prevent something which would be worse than bad. ... Notice the Apostle's carefulness. He does not say: 'It is good not to have a wife', but, 'It is good for a man not to touch a woman'. ... I am not expounding the law as to husbands and wives, but discussing the general question of sexual intercourse ‚Äì how in comparison with chastity and virginity, the life of angels, 'It is good for a man not to touch a woman'.\\" He also argued that marriage distracted from prayer, and so virginity was better: \\"If we are to pray always, it follows that we must never be in the bondage of wedlock, for as often as I render my wife her due, I cannot pray. The difference, then, between marriage and virginity is as great as that between not sinning and doing well; nay rather, to speak less harshly, as great as between good and better.\\" Regarding the clergy, he said: \\"Now a priest must always offer sacrifices for the people: he must therefore always pray. And if he must always pray, he must always be released from the duties of marriage.\\" In referring to Genesis chapter 2, he further argued that, \\"while Scripture on the first, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth days relates that, having finished the works of each, God saw that it was good, on the second day it omitted this altogether, leaving us to understand that two is not a good number because it destroys unity, and prefigures the marriage compact.\\" Jerome reaffirmed (\\"God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth\\") and (\\"Marriage is honourable in all\\"), and distanced himself from the disparagement of marriage by Marcion and Manichaeus, and from Tatian, who thought all sexual intercourse, even in marriage, to be impure.Paul John Frandsen, Incestuous and Close-kin Marriage in Ancient Egypt and Persia (Museum Tusculanum Press 2009 ), p. 94 There were, of course, counter-views. Pelagius thought Jerome showed bitter hostility to marriage akin to Manichaean dualism, an accusation that Jerome attempted to rebut in his Adversus Jovinianum: \\"We do not follow the views of Marcion and Manichaeus, and disparage marriage; nor, deceived by the error of Tatian, the leader of the Encratites, do we think all intercourse impure; he condemns and rejects not only marriage but also food which God created for the use of man. We know that in a great house, there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and earthenware. [...] While we honour marriage we prefer virginity which is the offspring of marriage. Will silver cease to be silver, if gold is more precious than silver?\\" Elsewhere he explained: \\"Someone may say: 'And do you dare disparage marriage, which is blessed by the Lord?' It is not disparaging marriage when virginity is preferred to it. No one compares evil with good. Let married women glory too, since they come second to virgins. Increase, He says, and multiply, and fill the earth. Let him who is to fill the earth increase and multiply. Your company is in heaven.\\" Mocking a monk who accused him of condemning marriage, Jerome wrote: \\"He must hear at least the echo of my cry, 'I do not condemn marriage', 'I do not condemn wedlock'. Indeed ‚Äî and this I say to make my meaning quite clear to him ‚Äî I should like every one to take a wife who, because they get frightened in the night, cannot manage to sleep alone.\\"Letter 50 (to Domnio) in Charles Mierow (ed) Letters of St Jerome, Paulist Press, 1962 It was Augustine (354‚Äì430), whose views subsequently strongly influenced Western theology,Fiorenza and Galvin (1991), p. 317 that was most influential in developing a theology of the sacramentality of Christian marriage.Saint Augustine, Marriage and Virginity (New City Press 1996, ) In his youth, Augustine had also been a follower of Manichaeism, but after his conversion to Christianity he rejected the Manichaean condemnation of marriage and reproduction for imprisoning spiritual light within material darkness.Elizabeth Ann Clark (editor), St. Augustine on Marriage and Sexuality (CUA Press 1996 ), p. 2 He subsequently went on to teach that marriage is not evil, but good, even if it is not at the level of choosing virginity: \\"Marriage and fornication are not two evils, whereof the second is worse: but marriage and continence are two goods, whereof the second is better.\\"Augustine, On the Good of Marriage, 8 In his On the Good of Marriage, of 401, he distinguished three values in marriage: fidelity, which is more than sexual; offspring, which \\"entails the acceptance of children in love, their nurturance in affection, and their upbringing in the Christian religion; and sacrament, in that its indissolubility is a sign of the eternal unity of the blessed.Fiorenza and Galvin (1991), p. 318 Like the other Church Fathers of East and West, Augustine taught that virginity is a higher way of life, although it is not given to everyone to live at that higher level. In his De bono coniugali (On the Good of Marriage), he wrote: \\"I know what people are murmuring: 'Suppose', they remark, 'that everyone sought to abstain from all intercourse? How would the human race survive?' I only wish that this was everyone's concern so long as it was uttered in charity, 'from a pure heart, a good conscience, and faith unfeigned'; then the city of God would be filled much more speedily, and the end of the world would be hastened.\\" Armstrong sees in this an apocalyptic dimension in Augustine's teaching. Reynolds says that Augustine's comment on this wildly hypothetical objection by Jovinian may have been that the saintliness of a church in which all had chosen celibacy would mean that it comprised enough members to fill God's city or that the church would thereby gather souls to herself even more rapidly than she was already doing.Phillip Reynolds, Marriage in the Western Church: The Christianization of Marriage During the Patristic and Early Medieval Period (Brill, Leiden, 1994 ), pp. 270-271 Nevertheless, Augustine's name \\"could, indeed, be invoked through the medieval centuries to reinforce the exaltation of virginity at the expense of marriage and to curtail the role of sexuality even within Christian marriage\\". Finally, Isidore of Seville (c. 560 ‚Äì 636) refined and broadened Augustine's formulation and was part of the chain by which it was transmitted to the Middle Ages.Paul Haffner, The Sacramental Mystery (Gracewing Publishing 1995 ), p. 203 Although not a church father, but belonging to the same period, in Adomnan of Iona's biography of St Columba, the saint at one point is mentioned as meeting a woman who refuses to sleep with her husband and perform her marriage duties. When Columba meets the woman, she says that she would do anything, even to go to a monastery and become a nun, rather than to sleep with him. Columba tells the woman that the commandment of God is for her to sleep with her husband and not to leave the marriage to be a nun, because once they are married the two have become one flesh.Adomnan of Iona. Life of St Columba, Penguin Books, 1995 =Medieval period= Sacramental development Betrothal and marriage around 1200 The medieval Christian church, taking the lead of Augustine, developed the sacramental understanding of matrimony. However, even at this stage the Catholic Church did not consider the sacraments equal in importance.Karen Armstrong, The Gospel According to Women, London, 1986 Marriage has never been considered either to be one of the sacraments of Christian initiation (Baptism, Confirmation, Eucharist) or of those that confer a character (Baptism, Confirmation, Holy Orders). With the development of sacramental theology, marriage was included in the select seven to which the term \\"sacrament\\" was applied. Explicit classification of marriage in this way came in reaction to the contrary teaching of Catharism that marriage and procreation are evil: the first official declaration that marriage is a sacrament was made at the 1184 Council of Verona as part of a condemnation of the Cathars. In 1208, Pope Innocent III required members of another religious movement, that of the Waldensians, to recognize that marriage is a sacrament as a condition for being received back into the Catholic Church. In 1254, Catholics accused Waldensians of condemning the sacrament of marriage, \\"saying that married persons sin mortally if they come together without the hope of offspring\\".Michael Thomsett, Heresy in the Roman Catholic church: A history, McFarland 2011 ), p. 105 The Fourth Lateran Council of 1215 had already stated in response to the teaching of the Cathars: \\"For not only virgins and the continent but also married persons find favour with God by right faith and good actions and deserve to attain to eternal blessedness.\\"John Clare Moore, Pope Innocent III (Brill 2003 ), p. 240 Marriage was also included in the list of the seven sacraments at the Second Council of Lyon in 1274 as part of the profession of faith required of Michael VIII Palaiologos. The sacraments of marriage and holy orders were distinguished as sacraments that aim at the \\"increase of the Church\\" from the other five sacraments, which are intended for the spiritual perfection of individuals. The Council of Florence in 1439 again recognised marriage as a sacrament.Francis Sch√ºssler Fiorenza, John P. Galvin (editors), Systematic Theology (Fortress Press 1991 ), vol. 2, p. 320 The medieval view of the sacramentality of marriage has been described as follows: \\"Like the other sacraments, medieval writers argued marriage was an instrument of sanctification, a channel of grace that caused God's gracious gifts and blessings to be poured upon humanity. Marriage sanctified the Christian couple by allowing them to comply with God's law for marriage and by providing them with an ideal model of marriage in Christ the bridegroom, who took the church as his bride and accorded it highest love, devotion, and sacrifice, even to the point of death.\\"John Witte, From Sacrament to Contract (Presbyterian Publishing 2012 ), p. 92 Liturgical practice Matrimony, for most of Church history, had been celebrated (as in traditions such as the Roman and Judaic) without clergy and was done according to local customs. The first available written detailed account of a Christian wedding in the West dates only from the 9th century and appears to be identical to the old nuptial service of Ancient Rome. However, early witnesses to the practice of intervention by the clergy in the marriage of early Christians include Tertullian, who speaks of Christians \\"requesting marriage\\" from them,Philip L. Reynolds, John Witte (editors), To Have and to Hold (Cambridge University Press 2007 ), p. 98 and Ignatius of Antioch, who said Christians should form their union with the approval of the bishop ‚Äì although the absence of clergy placed no bar, and there is no suggestion that the recommendation was widely adopted. In the 4th century in the Eastern Church it was the custom in some areas for marriages to receive a blessing by a priest to ensure fertility.Demetrios J. Constantelos, \\"Practice of the Sacrament of Matrimony according to the Orthodox Tradition\\" in The Jurist, vol. 31, no. 4 (Fall 1971), p. 620 There are also a few accounts of religious nuptial services from the 7th century onward.Constantelos (1971), p. 621 However, while in the East the priest was seen as ministering the sacrament, in the West it was the two parties to the marriage (if baptized) who effectively ministered, and their concordant word was sufficient proof of the existence of a sacramental marriage, whose validity required neither the presence of witnesses nor observance of the law of the 1215 Fourth Lateran Council that demanded publication of the banns of marriage.Witte (2012), p. 91 Thus, with few local exceptions, until in some cases long after the Council of Trent, marriages in Europe were by mutual consent, declaration of intention to marry and upon the subsequent physical union of the parties.Excerpt from Marriage, Sex, and Civic Culture in Late Medieval London \\"the sacramental bond of marriage could be made only through the freely given consent of both parties\\" The couple would promise verbally to each other that they would be married to each other; the presence of a priest or witnesses was not required. This promise was known as the \\"verbum.\\" If freely given and made in the present tense (e.g., \\"I marry you\\"), it was unquestionably binding; if made in the future tense (\\"I will marry you\\"), it would constitute a betrothal. One of the functions of churches from the Middle Ages was to register marriages, which was not obligatory. There was no state involvement in marriage and personal status, with these issues being adjudicated in ecclesiastical courts. During the Middle Ages marriages were arranged, sometimes as early as birth, and these early pledges to marry were often used to ensure treaties between different royal families, nobles, and heirs of fiefdoms. The church resisted these imposed unions, and increased the number of causes for nullification of these arrangements. As Christianity spread during the Roman period and the Middle Ages, the idea of free choice in selecting marriage partners increased and spread with it. The validity of such marriages even if celebrated under a tree or in a tavern or in a bed was upheld even against that of a later marriage in a church.Norman Tanner, New Short History of the Catholic Church (Continuum 2011 ), p. 92 Even after the Council of Trent made the presence of the parish priest or his delegate and of at least two more witnesses a condition for validity, the previous situation continued in the many countries where its decree was not promulgated. It ended only in 1908, with the coming into force of the Ne Temere decree. In the 12th century, Pope Alexander III decreed that what made a marriage was the free mutual consent by the spouses themselves, not a decision by their parents or guardians.Kenneth Pennington, \\"Pope Alexander III\\" in Frank J. Coppa (editor), The Great Popes through History: An Encyclopedia After that, clandestine marriages or youthful elopements began to proliferate, with the result that ecclesiastical courts had to decide which of a series of marriages that a man was accused of celebrating was the first and therefore the valid one.Russell B. Shaw, Our Sunday Visitor's Catholic Encyclopedia (Our Sunday Visitor Publishing 1998 ), pp. 241-242Peter Marshall, The Reformation: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford University Press 2009 ) Though \\"detested and forbidden\\" by the Church,Augustinus Lehmkuhl, \\"Sacrament of Marriage\\" in Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1910) they were acknowledged to be valid. Similarly today, Catholics are forbidden to enter mixed marriages without permission from an authority of the Church, but if someone does enter such a marriage without permission, the marriage is reckoned to be valid, provided the other conditions are fulfilled, although illicit. =Counter- Reformation= \\"Pope Paul III\\" (Artist: Titian) 1490‚Äì1576, c. 1543, Reign 13 October 1534 ‚Äì 10 November 1549, Presided over part of the Council of Trent In the 16th century, various groups adhering to the Protestant Reformation rejected to different degrees the sacramental nature of most Catholic sacraments. In reaction, the Council of Trent on 3 March 1547 carefully named and defined the Catholic Church's sacraments, reaffirmingGregory L. Klein, Robert A. Wolfe, Pastoral Foundations of the Sacraments (Paulist Press 1998 ), p. 134 the teaching that marriage is a sacrament ‚àí from 1184, 1208, 1274 and 1439. Recalling scripture, the apostolic traditions and the declarations of previous councils and of the Church Fathers, the bishops declared that there were precisely seven sacraments, with marriage one of them, and that all seven are truly and properly sacraments. Desiderius Erasmus had influenced the debate in the first part of the 16th century by publishing in 1518 an essay in praise of marriage (Encomium matrimonii), which argued that the single state was \\"a barren way of life hardly becoming to a man\\". The theologian Josse Clichtove working at the University of Paris interpreted this as an attack on chastity, but Erasmus had found favor with Protestant reformers who acknowledged the argument as a useful tool to undermine compulsory clerical celibacy and monasticism. Diarmaid MacCulloch argued that the action taken at Trent was therefore partly a response by Roman Catholicism to demonstrate that it was as serious about marriage and the family as the Protestants,.Diarmuid MacCulloch, Reformation: Europe's House Divided 1490‚Äì1700, London, 2008, p356 On 11 November 1563, the Council of Trent condemned the view that \\"the marriage state is to be placed above the state of virginity, or of celibacy, and that it is not better and more blessed to remain in virginity, or in celibacy, than to be united in matrimony\\". And while Catholics upheld the supernatural character of marriage, it was Protestants who viewed it as not a sacrament and who admitted divorce.Maria √Ögren, Amy Louise Erickson, The Marital Economy in Scandinavia and Britain, 1400-1900 (Ashgate Publishing 2005 ), p. 175Peter De Cruz, Family Law, Sex and Society (Routledge 2010), p. 27Katherine Anderson et al. (editors), Marriage - Just a Piece of Paper? (Eerdmans 2002 ), p. 237 The decree Tametsi of 1563 was one of the last decisions made at Trent. The decree effectively sought to impose the Church's control over the process of marriage by laying down as strict conditions as possible for what constituted a marriage.Diarmuid MacCulloch, Reformation: Europe's House Divided 1490‚Äì1700, London, 2008, p540 John P. Beal says the Council, \\"stung by the Protestant reformers' castigation of the Catholic Church's failure to extirpate clandestine marriages\\", issued the decree \\"to safeguard against invalid marriages and abuses in clandestine marriages\\",Mark G. McGowan, Waning of the Green (McGill-Queen's University Press 1999 ), p. 105 which had become \\"the scourge of Europe\\".Todd A. Salzmann, Michael G. Lawler, Sexual Ethics (Georgetown University Press 2012 ), p. 132 In 1215 the Fourth Lateran Council had prohibited marriages entered into clandestinely but, unless there was some other impediment, considered them valid though illicit. Tametsi made it a requirement even for validity, in any area where the decree was officially published, that the marriage take place in the presence of the parish priest and at least two witnesses.The Seven Sacraments Altarpiece of Rogier van der Weyden, of which the detail concerning the sacrament of marriage is given above, shows that the presence of a priest and at least two witnesses was customary more than a century before the decree was composed. This revolutionised earlier practice in that \\"marriages that failed to meet these requirements would from the time of the promulgation of the decree be considered invalid and of no effect\\"; and it required that the priest keep written records, with the result that parents had more control over their children's marriages than before. It also instituted controls over the marriages of persons without fixed addresses (\\"vagrants are to be married with caution\\"), \\"regulated the times at which marriages could be celebrated, abolished the rule that sexual intercourse created affinity, and reiterated the ban on concubinage\\".J. Waterworth, The Council of Trent: The Twenty-Fourth SessionJames Brundage, Law, Sex and Society in Medieval Europe (University of Chicago Press 2009 ), p. 564 For fear that the decree would \\"identify and multiply the number of doubtful marriages, particularly in Protestant areas, where 'mixed' marriages were common\\", the council hesitated to impose it outright and decided to make its application dependent on local promulgation. In fact, Tametsi was never proclaimed worldwide. It had no effect in France, England, Scotland and many other countriesLeonard Shelford, A Practical Treatise on the Law of Marriage and Divorce, pp. 36-37 and in 1907 was replaced by the decree Ne Temere, which came into effect universally at Easter 1908.

Stuart, Dissolution and Annulment of Marriage by the Catholic Church (Federation Press 1994 ), p. 75  Validity of marriage in the Catholic Church  The Catholic Church also has requirements before Catholics can be considered validly married in the eyes of the Church. A valid Catholic marriage results from four elements: (1) the spouses are free to marry; (2) they freely exchange their consent; (3) in consenting to marry, they have the intention to marry for life, to be faithful to one another and be open to children; and (4) their consent is given in the canonical form, i.e., in the presence of two witnesses and before a properly authorized church minister. Exceptions to the last requirement must be approved by church authority. The Church provides classes several months before marriage to help the participants inform their consent. During or before this time, the would- be spouses are confirmed if they have not previously received confirmation and it can be done without grave inconvenience (Canon 1065). The Catholic Church also recognizes as sacramental, (1) the marriages between two baptized Protestants or between two baptized Orthodox Christians, as well as (2) marriages between baptized non-Catholic Christians and Catholic Christians, although in the latter case, consent from the diocesan bishop must be obtained, with this termed \\"permission to enter into a mixed marriage\\". To illustrate (1), for example, \\"if two Lutherans marry in the Lutheran Church in the presence of a Lutheran minister, the Catholic Church recognizes this as a valid sacrament of marriage.\\" On the other hand, although the Catholic Church recognizes marriages between two non-Christians or those between a Catholic Christian and a non-Christian, these are not considered to be sacramental, and in the latter case, the Catholic Christian must seek permission from his/her bishop for the marriage to occur; this permission is known as \\"dispensation from disparity of cult\\". The Church prefers that marriages between Catholics, or between Catholics and other Christians, be celebrated in the parish church of one of the spouses. Those helping to prepare the couple for marriage can assist with the permission process. In present-day circumstances, with communities no longer so homogeneous religiously, authorization is more easily granted than in earlier centuries. = Canonical form = The canonical form of marriage began to be required with the decree Tametsi issued by the Council of Trent on 11 November 1563. The decree Ne Temere of Pope Pius X in 1907 made the canonical form a requirement even where the decree of the Council of Trent had not been promulgated. While allowing for exceptions, the canonical form of marriage, as laid down in canons 1055‚Äì1165 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law and canons 776-866 of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, normally recognizes marriages of Catholics as valid only if contracted before the local bishop or parish priest or a priest or (in the Latin Church only) a deacon delegated by them, and at least two witnesses. At earlier times, validity was not made dependent on fulfilment of this condition.  Freedom to marry  The participants in a marriage contract must be free to marry and to marry each other. That is, they must be an unmarried man and woman with no impediments as set out by canon law.  Impediments  A Catholic marriage cannot be formed if one or more of the following impediments are given, although for some of these a dispensation can be given. * Antecedent and perpetual impotence. * Consanguinity to the fourth degree in the collateral line (1st cousin), including legal adoption to the second collateral line. * Affinity (relationship by marriage, e.g. a brother-in-law) in the direct line. * Prior bond (the bond of a prior marriage, even if not consummated). * Holy Orders. ... Permission to marry is only given to those ordained clergy who have been fully laicized (relieved of active ministry, and then dismissed from the clerical state, a process which is begun by the (arch-)diocese or religious order community and is finally granted by the Roman Curia at the Vatican subject to papal approval: either the Congregation for Bishops (if the cleric was a bishop), the Congregation for the Clergy (if the cleric was a secular or diocesan priest or deacon), or the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life (for those clergy who are members of religious orders or secular institutes or other, unvowed societies). Laicization is given only for serious reasons for deacons, for grave reasons for priests, and very rarely for prelates. However, permanent deacons who are widowed have received permission from their pastors and dioceses and the Vatican to marry after ordination without having to leave the clerical state, probably to better support their families. A seminarian who has become a deacon, in a similar manner to other seminarians who leave the program of formation prior to priestly ordination, may be allowed to marry after a period of time and start a family, and, with the permission of the ordinary and the Vatican and the permission of his supervisor ‚Äì his pastor or former religious superior ‚Äì may continue to function as a secular, non- religious deacon. * Perpetual vows of chastity in a religious institute. ... It is harder to be excused from permanent, solemn vows as a religious than it is from the novitiate or from preliminary, initial vows, especially if the religious is ordained; it requires the permission of the local and regional religious superior, the knowledge of the local ordinary, and the permission ‚Äì subject to final papal approval ‚Äì of the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life. * Disparity of cult (one party not being baptised into a Trinitarian Christian denomination). * Crimen (one party previously conspiring to marry upon condition of the death of his/her spouse while still married); also called \\"conjugicide\\". * Underage (at least 16 for males, 14 for females). * Abduction.  Times of year for celebrating a marriage  Priest reading the blessing at a Catholic wedding, 2018 In the Latin Church, marriage may be celebrated during Lent even within a Nuptial Mass; however, it is considered inappropriate to have such a celebration during Holy Week and impossible during the Easter Triduum. In principle, no day of the week is excluded for marriage. Some Eastern Catholic Churches do not allow marriage during Lent. In earlier times, while the Latin Church allowed marriage to be celebrated at any time, it prohibited the solemn blessing of marriages during Advent and on Christmas Day, and during Lent and on Easter Sunday. = Mixed marriages = While marriage between a Catholic and any non-Catholic is commonly spoken of as a mixed marriage, in the strict sense a mixed marriage is one between a Catholic (baptized in the Catholic Church or received into it) and a non-Catholic Christian. The Catholic Church has from the start opposed marriage between a Catholic and any non-Catholic, baptized or not, seeing it as \\"degrading the holy character of matrimony, involving as it did a communion in sacred things with those outside the fold. [...] it was but natural and logical for the Church to do all in her power to hinder her children from contracting marriage with those outside her pale, who did not recognize the sacramental character of the union on which they were entering.\\" The Church thus saw as obstacles to a Catholic's marriage what came to be called the two impediments of mixed religion (in Latin, mixta religio) and of difference of worship (in Latin disparitas cultus).  Marriage with a non-Catholic Christian  From an early stage, Church councils forbade Catholic Christians to marry heretics or schismatics. Unlike marriage with a non-Christian, which came to be considered invalid, marriage with a heretic was seen as valid, though illicit unless a dispensation had been obtained. However, the Church's opposition to such unions is very ancient. Early regional councils, such as the 4th-century Council of Elvira and the Council of Laodicea, legislated against them; and the ecumenical Council of Chalcedon prohibited such unions especially between members of the lower ecclesiastical grades and heretical women.New Advent: Catholic Encyclopaedia In 692, the Council in Trullo declared such marriages invalid, a decision accepted in the East, but not in the West.John P. Beal, Commentary on the New Code of Canon Law (Paulist Press 2000 ), p. 1342 The advent of Protestantism in the 16th century renewed the problem of mixed marriages, and caused more stringent legislation. In those countries where the Council of Trent's Tametsi decree was promulgated, mixed marriages began to be viewed as invalid in the West, not directly because of being mixed, but because a condition for validity imposed by the decree was not observed, namely, that marriages be contracted before the parish priest or a priest delegated by him and at least two witnesses. This decree required the contract to be entered into before the parish priest or some other priest delegated by him, and in the presence of two or three witnesses under penalty of invalidity. Even where the Tametsi decree had been promulgated, the Church did not find it possible to insist on the rigour of this legislation in all countries, owing to strong Protestant opposition. However, the legislation was frequently enforced by Catholic parents stipulating in their wills that their children be disinherited if they renounced Catholicism. Pope Benedict XIV issued a declaration (the \\"Benedictine dispensation\\") concerning marriages in the Netherlands and Belgium (1741), in which he declared mixed unions to be valid, provided they were according to the civil laws. A similar declaration was made concerning mixed marriages in Ireland by Pope Pius, in 1785, and gradually the \\"Benedictine dispensation\\" was extended to various localities. Pius VI allowed mixed marriages in Austria to take place in the presence of a priest, provided no religious solemnity was employed, and with the omission of public banns, as evidence of the unwillingness of the Church to sanction such unions. In 1869, the Congregation of the Propaganda further permitted such marriages but only under condition of grave necessity, fearing the faithful \\"expose themselves to the grave dangers inherent in these unions\\". Bishops were to warn Catholics against such marriages and not to grant dispensations for them except for weighty reasons and not at the mere will of the petitioner. In countries where the decree was not promulgated, marriages otherwise contracted, called clandestine marriages, continued to be considered valid until the decree was replaced in 1908 by the decree Ne Temere of Pope Pius X, which revoked the \\"Benedictine dispensation\\". Catholics are forbidden to marry non-Catholic Christians \\"without express permission of the competent authority\\", but, if the other conditions are fulfilled, such a marriage entered into in spite of the prohibition is seen as valid and also, since it is a marriage between baptized persons, as a sacrament. A condition for granting permission to marry a non-Catholic is that the Catholic party undertake to remove dangers of defecting from the faith and to do all in his or her power so that all the children are baptized and brought up in the Catholic Church; the other party is to be made aware of this undertaking and obligation of the Catholic party. This requirement has been criticized.  Marriage with a non-Christian  The early Church did not consider invalid a Catholic's marriage with a non- Christian (someone not baptized), especially when the marriage had taken place before the Catholic's conversion to the faith. It was nevertheless hoped that the converted wife or husband would be the means of bringing the other party into the Church, or at least safeguarding the Catholic upbringing of the children of the union. \\"This held even for Jews, though the Church was naturally more opposed to wedlock between them and Christians, even than with pagans, owing to the intense Jewish hatred for the sacred name of Christ.\\" With the growth of the Church, the need for such unions diminished and the objection to them grew stronger. More by custom than by church legislation, such marriages gradually came to be considered invalid and disparitas cultus came to be seen as an impediment to marriage by a Catholic. There were also enactments on a local level against marriages with pagans (Council of Carthage (397), and under Stephen I of Hungary in the early 11th century) and with Jews (Third Council of Toledo in 589). When the Decretum of Gratian was published in the 12th century, this impediment became part of canon law. From that time forward, all marriages contracted between Catholics and non-Christians were held to be invalid unless a dispensation had been obtained from the ecclesiastical authority. A marriage between a Catholic and a non-Christian (someone not baptized) is seen by the Church as invalid unless a dispensation (called a dispensation from \\"disparity of cult\\", meaning difference of worship) is granted from the law declaring such marriages invalid. This dispensation can only be granted under certain conditions.Rhidian Jones, The Canon Law of the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of England (Continuum 2011 ), p. 56 If the dispensation is granted, the Church recognizes the marriage as valid, but natural rather than sacramental, since the sacraments can be validly received only by the baptized, and the non-Christian person does not share a relationship to Christ.United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, \\"Frequently Asked Questions about Marriage\\" Ladislas √ñrsy, Marriage in Canon Law (Gracewing 1986 ), pp. 112-113 =Remarriage of widows or widowers= The teaching of the Catholic Church is that a married couple commit themselves totally to one another until death. The vows they make to each other in the wedding rite are a commitment \\"til death do us part\\".Sacrament of Marriage After the death of one, the other is free to marry again or to remain single. Some choose to become priests or religious. This path was chosen by some even in the early Christian centuries by people such as Saint Marcella, Saint Paula, Saint Galla of Rome and Saint Olympias the Deaconess.M√°ria Puskely, K√°roly V√∂r√∂s, Vilmos Zsidi. A kereszt√©ny Eur√≥pa szellemi gy√∂kerei. Az √∂reg f√∂ldr√©sz hagiogr√°fi√°ja. (The Spiritual Roots of Christian Europe. The Hagiography of the Old World). Kairosz Kiad√≥, Budapest 2004. pp. 38‚Äì40, 59, 177‚Äì178  Ministers of matrimony  = Western Church = Ceremony of Marriage (Giulio Rosati) The husband and wife must validly execute the marriage contract. In the Latin Catholic tradition, it is the spouses who are understood to confer marriage on each other. The spouses, as ministers of grace, naturally confer upon each other the sacrament of matrimony, expressing their consent before the church. This does not eliminate the need for church involvement in the marriage; under normal circumstances, canon law requires for validity the attendance of the local bishop or parish priest (or a priest or deacon delegated by either of them) and at least two witnesses. The priest has merely the role to \\"assist\\" the spouses in order to ensure that the marriage is contracted in accord with canon law, and is supposed to attend whenever it is possible. A competent layperson may be delegated by the Church, or may just attend in place of the priest, if it is impractical to have a priest attending. In the event that no competent layperson is found, the marriage is valid even if done in the presence of two witnesses alone.canons 1108‚Äì1116 For example, in May 2017, the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments granted a bishop's request that a nun be granted permission to officiate at a marriage ceremony in Quebec because of a shortage of priests. = Eastern Churches = Crowning during Holy Matrimony in the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church, which is an Eastern Catholic Church and a part of the Saint Thomas Christian community in India Eastern Catholic churches share the tradition common throughout Eastern Christianity, according to which the minister of the sacrament is the bishop or priest who \\"crowns the bridegroom and the bride as a sign of the marriage covenant\\", a ceremony that has led to the sacrament being called the Crowning.Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1623 For a fuller account of the rites of marriage in Eastern Christianity see Paul F. Bradshaw, The New SCM Dictionary of Liturgy and Worship (Hymns Ancient and Modern Ltd, 2002, ), pp. 298-299 and Syro-Malabar Matrimony  Indissolubility  Catholic theology teaches that a validly contracted sacramental marriage is accompanied by divine ratification, creating a virtually indissoluble union until the couple consummate, after which the sacramental marriage is dissoluble only by the death of a spouse. An unconsummated marriage can be dissolved by the Pope, as Vicar of Christ. Once a sacramental marriage is consummated, only a separation is possible: the marriage bond cannot be dissolved by any power. In the eyes of the Church, even validly contracted natural marriages (marriages in which at least one of the parties is not baptized) cannot be dissolved by the will of the couple or by any action of the state.Michael Smith Foster, Annulment, the Wedding that Was (Paulist Press 1999 ), q. 27Robert Ricard, The Spiritual Conquest of Mexico (University of California Press 1974 ), p. 113 Accordingly, \\"the Catholic Church does not recognize or endorse civil divorce of a natural marriage, as of a sacramental marriage\\".Sebastian S. Karambai, Ministers and Ministries in the Local Church (St Pauls BYB 2005 ), p. 411, footnote 38 However, a natural marriage, even if consummated, can be dissolved by the Church when to do so favours the maintenance of the faith on the part of a Christian, cases of what has been called Pauline privilege and Petrine privilege. In these cases, which require intervention by the Holy See, the Church admits real divorce, actual dissolution of a valid marriage, as distinct from the granting by merely human power of a divorce that, according to Catholic theology, does not really dissolve the marriage bond. While the violation of some regulations may make a marriage illicit, but not invalid, some conditions are essential and their absence means that there is in fact no valid marriage, and the participants are considered not to be actually married. However, Canon 1137 states that children born to a \\"putative\\" marriage (defined in Canon 1061, sec. 3 as one that is not valid but was entered into in good faith by at least one spouse) are legitimate; therefore, the declaration that a marriage is null does not render the children of that marriage illegitimate. = Annulments = The Catholic Church has consistently taken the position that, while dissolution of a valid natural marriage, even if consummated, may be granted for the sake of someone's Christian faith (\\"in favorem fidei\\"), though not for other reasons, and that a valid sacramental marriage, if not consummated, may be dissolved, a valid sacramental consummated marriage is indissoluble. There is no divorce from such a marriage. However, what is referred to as a marriage annulment occurs when two competent ecclesiastical tribunals hand down concordant judgements that a particular marriage was not in fact a valid one.Lawrence E. Mick, Marriage (Liturgical Press 2007 ), p. 15 Requirements for the validity of marriage are listed in the Code of Canon Law under the headings \\"Diriment Impediments\\" (such as being too young, being impotent, being already married, being ordained), \\"Matrimonial Consent\\" (which requires, for instance, sufficient use of reason, psychic ability to assume the essential obligations of marriage, and freedom from force and fear), and \\"The Form of the Celebration of Marriage\\" (normally requiring that it be contracted in the presence of the parish priest or his delegate and at least two other witnesses). An annulment is a declaration that the marriage was invalid (or null) at the time the vows were exchanged. Thus, an annulment is declared only when an ecclesial tribunal finds a lack of validity in the marriage at the time of the marital contract. Behaviour subsequent to the contract is not directly relevant, except as post factum evidence of the validity or invalidity of the contract. That is, behaviour subsequent to the contract cannot actually change the validity of the contract. For example, a marriage would be invalid if one of the parties, at the time of marriage, did not intend to honour the vow of fidelity. If the spouse did intend to be faithful at the time of the marriage but later committed adultery this does not invalidate the marriage. The teaching of the Catholic church is that annulment and divorce therefore differ, both in rationale and effect; an annulment is a finding that a true marriage never existed, whereas a divorce is a dissolution of marriage. In canon law there are numerous reasons for granting annulments of marriages that were entered into invalidly.Eileen F. Stuart, Dissolution and Annulment of Marriage by the Catholic Church (Federation Press 1994 ), pp. 147-194 MacCulloch has noted the \\"ingenuity\\" of Roman Catholic lawyers in deploying these in the historical context.Dairmuid MacCulloch, Reformation: Europe's House Divided 1490‚Äì1700, London, 2008 Annulments are not restricted to marriages. A similar process can lead to the annulment of an ordination.Michael Smith Foster, Annulment: The Wedding That Was (Paulist Press 1999 ), q. 89  Sins against marriage and conjugal chastity  The teaching of the Catholic Church is that marriage may only be between one man and one woman with each partner's free and willing consent for the good of each other and for the transmission of human life. The church believes adultery, divorce, remarriage after divorce, marriage without the intent to transmit life, polygamy, incest, child abuse, free union, and trial marriage are sins against the dignity of marriage.Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2380-2391 Adultery refers to marital infidelity...Divorce is a grave offense against the natural law...[P]olygamy is not in accord with the moral law...Incest designates intimate relations between relatives or in-laws within a degree that prohibits marriage between them...Connected to incest is any sexual abuse perpetrated by adults on children or adolescents entrusted to their care...The expression \\"free union\\" is fallacious...Some today claim a \\"right to a trial marriage\\" where there is an intention of getting married later. However firm the purpose of those who engage in premature sexual relations may be, \\"the fact is that such liaisons can scarcely ensure mutual sincerity and fidelity in a relationship between a man and a woman, nor, especially, can they protect it from inconstancy of desires or whim.\\"Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, 347 and 349 Adultery and polygamy are opposed to the sacrament of matrimony because they contradict the equal dignity of man and woman and the unity and exclusivity of married love. Other sins include the deliberate refusal of one‚Äôs procreative potential which deprives conjugal love of the gift of children and divorce which goes against the indissolubility of marriage...The Church, since she is faithful to her Lord, cannot recognize the union of people who are civilly divorced and remarried. The church also believes that chastity must be practiced by spouses,Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2348-2349 All the baptized are called to chastity... Married people are called to live conjugal chastity;... and that sins against chastity include lust, masturbation, fornication, pornography, prostitution, rape, incest, child abuse, and homosexuality.Catechism of the Catholic Church 2351-2357 Lust is disordered desire for or inordinate enjoyment of sexual pleasure...\\"Both the Magisterium of the Church, in the course of a constant tradition, and the moral sense of the faithful have been in no doubt and have firmly maintained that masturbation is an intrinsically and gravely disordered action.\\"...Fornication is carnal union between an unmarried man and an unmarried woman.

History  Cr√®me caramel used to be ubiquitous in European restaurants; food historian Alan Davidson remarks: Etymology of names In this context, cr√®me in French means 'custard'. The names cr√®me (caramel) renvers√©e (French) and crema volteada (Spanish) allude to the custard being turned over to be served. Caramel puddings in a restaurant Both cr√®me caramel (\\"caramel cream\\") and flan are French names, but flan has come to have different meanings in different regions. In Spanish-speaking countries and often in the United States, cr√®me caramel is known as flan. This was originally a Spanish-language usage, but the dish is now best known in North America in a Latin American context. Elsewhere, including in Britain, a flan is a type of tart somewhat like a quiche. The Modern English word flan comes from French flan, from Old French flaon, in turn from Medieval Latin fladonem, derived from the Old High German flado, a sort of flat cake, probably from an Indo-European root for 'flat' or 'broad'.Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd Edition (1989); Petit Robert 1973. Preparation, cooking and presentation Restaurant-prepared order of cr√®me caramel, with sauce and garnish =Preparation= Cr√®me caramel is a variant of plain custard (cr√®me) where sugar syrup cooked to caramel stage is poured into the mold before adding the custard base. It is usually cooked in a bain- marie on a stovetop or in the oven in a water bath. It is turned and served with the caramel sauce on top, hence the alternate French names cr√®me (caramel) renvers√©e or cr√®me renvers√©e au caramel. The milk may be flavored with vanilla, cinnamon, or lemon peel. The resulting texture is gelatinous and creamy. Turning out larger dishes requires care, as the custard easily splits. Larger dishes also require more care to avoid undercooking the interior or overcooking the exterior. Thus, cr√®me caramel is often cooked and served in individual ramekins. The objective is to obtain a homogeneous and smooth cream on the surface of the cr√®me caramel with a liquid caramel base. Cooking it in a bain-marie avoids burning the caramel. =Imitations= An imitation of cr√®me caramel may be prepared from \\"instant flan powder\\", which is thickened with agar or carrageenan rather than eggs. In some Latin American countries, the true custard version is known as \\"milk flan\\" (flan de leche) or even \\"milk cheese\\", and the substitute version is known as just \\"flan\\". Regional varieties Caramel custard served at a restaurant in Mangalore, India = Puerto Rico = Most Puerto Rican flans are milk-based. Some are coconut-based and called flan de coco, made with both condensed milk and coconut milk or with cream of coconut, condensed milk and evaporated milk. Beaten egg white foam is used to lighten the mixture. Coconut flan is usually seasoned with cinnamon, rum and vanilla. Around the Thanksgiving holiday it is popular to add pumpkin, batata (similar to sweet potato) or √±ame pur√©e along with spices like ginger, vanilla, cinnamon to the flan. A combination of pumpkin, coconut, sweet potato, carrot and almond extract flan is unique and only served on Thanksgiving. Another popular flan is flancocho, flavored with a layer of cream cheese and Puerto Rican-style sponge cake underneath. The flancocho can also be made with cream cheese and cake batter worked into the flan mix. Other popular flavors are pi√±a colada, mango, pineapple, lemon, lime, guava, passion fruit, tamarind, and banana. Spanish lime, sweet plantains, sesame seed milk, breadfruit and cassava are also uniquely Puerto Rican. = Croatia = Croatian ro≈æata In Croatia, ro≈æata, rozata, ro≈æada or rozada () is flavored with the Dubrovnik liqueur rozalin (rose liqueur), which gives the cake its characteristic aroma. Modern variations include vanilla and other flavorings.\\"Traditional Cuisine of the Makarska Littoral\\" = Portugal = Portuguese Pudim Abade de Priscos Known as Pudim flan, made with milk, eggs, caramelized sugar and vanilla. Variations include orange or lemon zest, cinnamon, pineapple, Port wine or even bacon as its the case with Pudim Abade de Priscos. It characteristically has a hole in the center. = India = Homemade caramel pudding, Mumbai Caramel custard is popular, especially in the larger coastal cities, and in former Portuguese colonies such as Goa, Daman and Diu. Sometimes, masala chai is added on the side. It is a staple on restaurant menus in the beach resorts along India's coasts and also prepared regularly in the home kitchens of the Anglo-Indian Goan, Malayali, Mangalorean and Parsi communities. = Japan = Packaged cr√®me caramel is ubiquitous in Japanese convenience stores under the name (i.e., \\"pudding\\"), or custard pudding. The same kind of dessert are sold in convenience stores in Taiwan. = Malaysia = Caramel custard is a very popular dessert in Malaysia. First introduced by the Portuguese in the 1500s and sold year-round today, this dessert is popular served in restaurants, cafes, hotels and even Ramadan bazaars for breaking the fast. = Philippines = Philippine leche flan are characteristically oval-shaped due to the traditional use of tin molds known as llaneras. In the Philippines, flan is known as leche flan (the local term for the originally Spanish flan de leche, literally \\"milk flan\\"), which is a heavier version of the Spanish dish, made with condensed milk and more egg yolks. Leche flan is usually steamed over an open flame or stove top in an oval-shaped tin mold known as llanera (also spelled lyanera), although rarely it can also be baked. Leche flan is a staple dessert in celebratory feasts. An even heavier version, called tocino de cielo or tocino del cielo (Spanish for \\"heaven's bacon\\"), is similar, but has significantly more egg yolks and sugar. Leche flan is also commonly baked into pastries. The most common is the Filipino dessert flan cake or leche flan cake, a Filipino chiffon or sponge cake with a layer of leche flan on top. It can similarly be baked into steamed cupcakes known as puto mam√≥n, a combination known as puto flan. = Vietnam = Cr√®me caramel was introduced by the French and is common in Vietnam. It is known as b√°nh caramel, caramen or kem caramel in northern Vietnam or b√°nh flan or kem flan in southern Vietnam. Variations include serving with black coffee poured on top, or browning the caramel past typical caramelization point to make a darker, more bitter \\"burnt caramel\\". =Latin America= Argentinean flan and dulce de leche Most notably in Argentina, Chile, Peru and Uruguay, cr√®me caramel is usually eaten with dulce de leche, whipped cream, or both (flan mixto). In Chile, it is often eaten with dulce de membrillo (quince jelly) or condensed milk. Also at most equatorial and Caribbean countries the inclusion of coconut, condensed milk and evaporated milk is widespread. The milk base may also be flavored with nuts, fruit, and so on. = Brazil and Venezuela = In Venezuela and Brazil, it is often made with condensed milk, milk, eggs and sugar caramelized on top. The Venezuelan version is known as quesillo (\\"small cheese\\") and in Brazil, it is known as pudim (\\"pudding\\"). It can have variations of flavor, such as chocolate, coconut, pa√ßoca (peanut candy), cheese and others, being the condensed milk pudding a base recipe. = Costa Rica = Flan in Costa Rica often features coconut or coffee (flan de caf√©). = Cuba = Cuban flan (flan de Cuba) is made with the addition of the whites of two eggs and a cinnamon stick. A similar Cuban dish is Copa Lolita, a small caramel flan served with one or two scoops of vanilla ice cream. Other variations include coconut or rum raisin topping. = Dominican Republic = In the Dominican Republic, only egg yolks are used, mixed with vanilla, evaporated milk and condensed milk. Coconut flan is known as quesillo. = Mexico = Flan is extremely popular in Mexico, being made at home, found pre- made at grocery stores, served in restaurants, and even vended on the streets. A variation of the dish called Flan Napolitano is made in some parts of Mexico where cream cheese is added to create a creamier consistency, though it is not as popular or wide spread. Flan's popularity among Mexican-Americans helped the dish become popular in the United States. Another variation is \\"Flan de Cajeta\\" which replaces the standard caramel with cajeta (Milk caramel with a base of goat Milk) = Peru = In Peru, crema volteada 'flipped cream' may use condensed rather than regular milk. Fruit may also be added, such as lucuma, custard apple, soursop or granadilla. = Chile = In Chile, Leche asada or 'roasted milk' is similar to Cr√®me caramel because it is made with the same ingredients, but Leche asada has a less smooth texture and is baked directly, which creates a toasted layer on the surface.

Britannica Online Encyclopedia. The story is set in a Soviet labor camp in the 1950s and describes a single day in the life of ordinary prisoner, Ivan Denisovich Shukhov. Although the title refers to the main character by his given name, Ivan, and patronymic name, Denisovich (son of Denis), the character is only mentioned by his surname, Shukov, throughout the entirety of the book. The book's publication was an extraordinary event in Soviet literary history, since never before had an account of Stalinist repression been openly distributed. Novy Mir editor Aleksandr Tvardovsky wrote a short introduction for the issue entitled \\"Instead of a Foreword\\" to prepare the journal's readers for what they were about to experience. Translations At least five English translations have been made. Of those, Ralph Parker's translation (New York: Dutton, 1963) was the first to be published,Solzhenitsyn, Alexander. One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich. Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1963. (Penguin Books ; 2053) 0816 followed by Ronald Hingley and Max Hayward's (New York: Praeger, 1963), Bela Von Block's (New York: Lancer 1963), and Gillon Aitken's (New York: Farrar Straus Giroux, 1971). The fifth translation, by H.T. Willetts (New York: Noonday/Farrar Straus Giroux, 1991), is the only one that is based on the canonical Russian text and the only one authorized by Solzhenitsyn. The English spelling of some character names differs slightly among the translations. Plot Ivan Denisovich Shukhov has been sentenced to a camp in the Soviet gulag system. He was accused of becoming a spy after being captured briefly by the Germans as a prisoner of war during World War II. Although innocent, he is sentenced to ten years in a forced labor camp. The day begins with Shukhov waking up sick. For waking late, he is forced to clean the guardhouse, but this is a comparatively minor punishment. When Shukhov is finally able to leave the guardhouse, he goes to the dispensary to report his illness. It is relatively late in the morning by this time, however, so the orderly is unable to exempt any more workers and Shukhov must work. The rest of the novel deals mainly with Shukhov's squad (the 104th, which has 24 members), their allegiance to the squad leader, and the work that the prisoners (zeks) do in hopes of getting extra food for their performance. For example, they are seen working at a brutal construction site where the cold freezes the mortar used for bricklaying if not applied quickly enough. Solzhenitsyn also details the methods used by the prisoners to survive; the whole camp lives by the rule of survival of the fittest. Tiurin, the foreman of gang 104, is strict but kind, and the squad's fondness of Tiurin becomes more evident as the book progresses. Though a morose man, Tiurin is liked because he understands the prisoners, he talks to them, and he helps them. Shukhov is one of the hardest workers in the squad, possessing versatile skills that are in great demand, and he is generally well-respected. Rations are meager ‚Äì prisoners only receive them on the basis of how productive their work units are (or the authorities think they have been) ‚Äì but they are one of the few things that Shukhov lives for. He conserves the food that he receives and is always watchful for any item that he can hide and trade for food at a later date, or for favors and services he can do prisoners that they will thank him for in small gifts of food. At the end of the day, Shukhov is able to provide a few special services for Tsezar (Caesar), an intellectual who does office work instead of manual labor. Tsezar is most notable, however, for receiving packages of food from his family. Shukhov is able to get a small share of Tsezar's packages by standing in lines for him. Shukhov reflects on his day, which was both productive and fortuitous for him. He did not get sick, his group had been assigned well paid work, he had filched a second ration of food at lunch, and he had smuggled into camp a small piece of metal he would fashion into a useful tool. Main characters The 104th is the labor-camp team to which protagonist Ivan Denisovich belongs. There are over 24 members, though the book describes the following characters the most thoroughly: * Ivan Denisovich Shukhov (–ò–≤–∞–Ω –î–µ–Ω–∏—Å–æ–≤–∏—á –®—É—Ö–æ–≤), the protagonist of the novel. The reader is able to see Russian camp life through Shukhov's eyes, and information is given through his thoughts, feelings, and actions. * Alyoshka/Alyosha (–ê–ª—ë—à–∫–∞),Alexey (–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–µ–π) is used once in the original Russian. Willetts replaces that with Alyoshka. a Baptist. He believes that being imprisoned is something that he has earned, since it allows him to reflect more on God and Jesus. Alyoshka, surprisingly, is able to hide part of a Bible in the barracks. Shukhov responds to his beliefs by saying that he believes in God but not heaven or hell, nor in spending much time on the issue. * Gopchik (–ì–æ–ø—á–∏–∫), a young member of the squad who works hard and for whom Shukhov has fatherly feelings, as he reminds Shukhov of his dead son. Gopchik was imprisoned for taking food to Ukrainian ultranationalists. Shukhov believes that Gopchik has the knowledge and adjustment skills to advance far at the camp. * Andrey Prokofyevich Tiurin/Tyurin (–ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –ü—Ä–æ–∫–æ—Ñ—å–µ–≤–∏—á –¢—é—Ä–∏–Ω), the foreman/squad leader of the 104th. He has been in the camp for 19 years. Tyurin likes Shukhov and gives him some of the better jobs, but he is also subject to the camp hierarchy; Tyurin must argue for better jobs and wages from the camp officers in order to please the squad, who then must work hard in order to please the camp officers and get more rations. * Fetiukov/Fetyukov (–§–µ—Ç—é–∫–æ–≤), a member of the squad who has thrown away all of his dignity. He is particularly seen as a lowlife by Shukhov and the other camp members. He shamelessly scrounges for bits of food and tobacco. * Tsezar/Caesar Markovich (–¶–µ–∑–∞—Ä—å –ú–∞—Ä–∫–æ–≤–∏—á), an inmate who works in the camp office and has been given other special privileges; for example, his civilian fur hat was not confiscated by the Personal Property department. Tzesar is a film director who was imprisoned before he could finish his first feature film. Some discussions in the novel indicate that he holds formalist views in art, which were probably the reason for his imprisonment. A cultured man, Tzesar discusses film with Buynovsky. His somewhat higher class background assures him food parcels. * Buinovsky/Buynovsky (–ë—É–π–Ω–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π) also called \\"The Captain\\", a former Soviet Naval captain and a relative newcomer to the camp. Buinovsky was imprisoned after he received a gift from an admiral on a British cruiser on which he had served as a naval liaison. In the camp, Buinovsky has not yet learned to be submissive before the warders. * Pavlo (–ü–∞–≤–ª–æ), a Ukrainian who serves as deputy foreman/squad leader and assists Tiurin in directing the 104th, especially when Tiurin is absent. * Ivan Kilgas/Kildigs (–ò–≤–∞–Ω –ö–∏–ª—å–¥–∏–≥—Å), the leading worker of the 104th squad along with Shukhov, a Latvian by birth. He speaks Russian like a native, having learned it in his childhood. Kilgas is popular with the team for making jokes. * Senka Klevshin (–°–µ–Ω—å–∫–∞ –ö–ª–µ–≤—à–∏–Ω), a member of the 104th who became deaf from intense fighting during World War II. He escaped from the Germans three times and was recaptured each time, ending up in the Buchenwald concentration camp. Themes The main themes of One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich are totalitarian oppression and camp survival. Specifically discussed are the prison officials' cruelty and spite towards their fellow man. Solzhenitsyn explains through Ivan Denisovich that everything is managed by the camp commandant to the point that time feels unnoticed; the prisoners always have work to do and never have any free time to discuss other issues. Survival is of the utmost importance to prisoners. Attitude is another crucial factor in survival., Kuziomen's speech. Since prisoners are each assigned a grade, it is considered good etiquette to obey. This is outlined through the character of Fetiukov, a ministry worker who has let himself into prison and scarcely follows prison etiquette. Another such incident involves Buinovsky, a former naval captain, who is punished for defending himself and others during an early morning frisking. History One Day is a sparse, tersely written narrative of a single day of the ten-year labor camp imprisonment of a fictitious Soviet prisoner, Ivan Denisovich Shukhov. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn had first-hand experience in the Gulag system, having been imprisoned from 1945 to 1953 for writing derogatory comments in letters to friends about the conduct of the war by Joseph Stalin, whom he referred to by epithets such as \\"the master\\" and \\"the boss\\". Drafts of stories found in Solzhenitsyn's map case had been used to incriminate him (Frangsmyr, 1993). Solzhenitsyn claimed the prisoners wept when news of Stalin's death reached them. He uses the epithet batka usaty () in his novel, which translates to \\"Old Whiskers\\". In a footnote, Parker says this refers to Stalin. or \\"Old Man Whiskers\\". This title was considered offensive and derogatory, but prisoners were free to call Stalin whatever they liked: \\"Somebody in the room was bellowing: 'Old Man Whiskers won't ever let you go! He wouldn't trust his own brother, let alone a bunch of cretins like you!\\" In 1957, after being released from the exile that followed his imprisonment, Solzhenitsyn began writing One Day. In 1962, he submitted his manuscript to Novy Mir, a Russian literary magazine. The editor, Aleksandr Tvardovsky, was so impressed with the detailed description of life in the labor camps that he submitted the manuscript to the Communist Party Central Committee for approval to publish it‚Äîuntil then Soviet writers had not been allowed to refer to the camps. From there it was sent to the de-Stalinist Nikita Khrushchev, who, despite the objections of some top party members, ultimately authorized its publication with some censorship of the text. After the novel was sent to the editor, Aleksandr Tvardovsky of Novy Mir, it was published in November 1962.John Bayley's introduction and the chronology in the Knopf edition of the Willetts translation. The labor camp described in the book was one that Solzhenitsyn had served some time at, and was located in Karaganda in northern Kazakhstan. Reception One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich was specifically mentioned in the Nobel Prize presentation speech when the Nobel Committee awarded Solzhenitsyn the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1970.\\"The Nobel Prize in Literature 1970 Presentation Speech\\" by Karl Ragnar Gierow. The Nobel citation is \\"for the ethical force with which he has pursued the indispensable traditions of Russian literature.\\" Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn did not personally receive the Prize until 1974 after he had been deported from the Soviet Union. Following the publication of One Day... Solzhenitsyn wrote four more books, three in 1963 and a fourth in 1966 which cataclysmically led to the controversy of his publications. In 1968, Solzhenitsyn was accused by the Literary Gazette, a Soviet newspaper, of not following Soviet principles. The Gazette's editors also made claims that Solzhenitsyn was opposing the basic principles of the Soviet Union, his style of writing had been controversial with many Soviet literary critics especially with the publication of One Day ... . This criticism made by the paper gave rise to further accusations that Solzhenitsyn had turned from a Soviet Russian into a Soviet enemy, therefore he was branded as an enemy of the state, who, according to the Gazette, had been supporting non-Soviet ideological stances since 1967, perhaps even longer. He, in addition, was accused of de- Stalinisation. The reviews were particularly damaging. Solzhenitsyn was expelled from the Soviet Writers' Union in 1969. He was arrested, then deported in 1974. The novella had sold over 95,000 copies after it was released and throughout the 1960s. While Solzhenitsyn and his work were originally received negatively, under the leadership of Nikita Khrushchev, the book's mass publication was allowed in order to undermine the influence of Josef Stalin on the Soviet Union. However, critics of this action argue that this action unleashed liberalization that would cause the publication of more radical works and eventually the dissolution of the Soviet Union. =Influence= One Day is often considered the most powerful indictment of the Soviet gulag that was ever written and appeared on the Independent newspaper's poll of the Top 100 books, which surveyed more than 25,000 people. Vitaly Korotich declared: \\"The Soviet Union was destroyed by information - and this wave started from Solzhenitsyn's One Day\\". Film A one-hour dramatization for television, made for NBC in 1963, starred Jason Robards Jr. in the title role and was broadcast on November 8, 1963. A 1970 film adaptation based on the novella starred British actor Tom Courtenay in the title role. Finland banned the film from public view, fearing that it could hurt external relations with its eastern neighbor.

Antique trestle desk The antique trestle desk is usually very much like the writing table desk form, which offers a simple flat desktop surface with a few drawers underneath it. Unlike the writing table the trestle desk is supported by two legs instead of four, and the legs are designed to be dismantled easily in order to store or move the desk efficiently. More precisely, the two legs are two strong side supports which branch out in two feet each (for a total of four) at the bottom. Some antique trestle desks are fitted with small cubbyholes and nooks or small drawers at the extremity of the work surface, and thus resemble a bureau √† gradin. File:Trestledeskfrontinjpeg20040201.png File:Trestledesksideinjpeg20040201.png As with most antique desk forms, this trestle desk surface is usually 29 inches (73.7 cm) from the floor. Modern trestle desk The modern trestle desk is not so much a desk form as a desk improvisation. In shape and manufacture it sometimes resembles certain variations of the antique field desk which was used by officers not too far from the battlefield. Basically, the modern trestle desk improv is a plank of wood set on two trestles. It is eminently portable, and eminently practical, when care is taken to provide stable trestles. The advent of the cubicle desk created a market for independent desk elements of all kinds, such as short, rolling filing cabinets. These proved suitable for use under a trestle desk and encouraged improvisation. During the heyday of the dot-com boom, many companies liked to go to the extremes in office furnishings. Some would stock rooms with expensive Aeron chairs and the most lavish type of ergonomic desk available, while others would have their employees sit on boxes and work on desks made of used doors set on old trestles or crates. Others still mixed the costly and the cheap, sometimes to the advantage of the user, by doing things like picking good quality chairs and making cheap but sturdy trestle desk improvisations. These activities popularised the trestle desk as a desk form, and some of this survived after the dot-com burst in the year 2000. For instance, Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos and top Amazon executives usually worked on doors set on trestle supports, as a visible example of a frugal company culture. In the United States, a desk or a table set on X-shaped trestles is sometimes called a sawbuck table. See also the list of desk forms and types.  References  *Gloag, John.

Commercial desktop versions are sold for macOS, Windows, and Linux, although Laminar Research also distributes FAA-certified versions for professional use. A mobile version is available for Android, iOS, and webOS since 2009 as well. X-Plane is pre-packaged with several commercial and military aircraft, as well as basic global scenery, which covers most of the Earth. X-Plane also has a plugin architecture that allows users to create their own modules, extending the functionality of the software by letting users create their own worlds or replicas of places on Earth. This is further enhanced by the Scenery Gateway website, which allows users to share airports with other users, which can be eventually integrated into the base product. On November 25, 2016, Laminar Research released the public beta of the simulator's latest version, X-Plane 11, to the general public. A second public beta was released on December 6, 2016, which fixed some major bugs. The official release of X-Plane 11 was on March 30, 2017. On 9 December 2019, X-Plane 10 Mobile Global, a major update for the mobile port, was released. Although initially available for free, only five initial locations are available without purchase. Flight model Screenshot of X-Plane 11.25: Beechcraft King Air C90 at Appleton International Airport out of the box X-Plane differentiates itself from other simulators by implementing an aerodynamic model called blade element theory. Traditionally, flight simulators emulate the real-world performance of an aircraft by using empirical data in predefined lookup tables to determine aerodynamic forces such as lift or drag, which vary with differing flight conditions. These simulators sufficiently simulate the flight characteristics of the aircraft, specifically those with known aerodynamic data, but are not useful in design work, and do not predict the performance of aircraft when the actual figures are not available. Blade element theory improves on this type of simulation by modelling the forces and moments on an aircraft and individually evaluating the parts that constitute it. Blade-element theory and other computational aerodynamic models are often used to compute aerodynamic forces in real time or pre-compute aerodynamic forces of a new design for use in a simulator employing lookup tables. With blade element theory, a surface (e.g. wing) may be made up of many sections (1 to 4 is typical), and each section is further divided into as many as 10 separate subsections. After that, the lift and drag of each section are calculated, and the resulting effect is applied to the whole aircraft. When this process is applied to each component, the simulated aircraft will fly similar to its real-life counterpart. This approach allows users to design aircraft quickly and easily, as the simulator engine immediately illustrates how an aircraft with a given design might perform in the real world. X-Plane can model fairly complex aircraft designs, including helicopters, rockets, rotorcraft, and tilt-rotor craft. Extensibility A Boeing 727-200F, one of the many 3rd party aircraft available for X-Plane Users are encouraged to design their own aircraft, and design software titled Plane Maker and Airfoil Maker are included with the program. This has created an active community of users who use the simulator for a variety of purposes. Since designing an aircraft is relatively simple and the flight model can help predict performance of real-world aircraft, several aircraft companies use X-Plane in their design process. The CarterCopter uses X-Plane for flight training and research. X-Plane also contributed to the design of the Atlantica blended wing body aircraft. Through the plugin interface, users can create external modules that extend the X-Plane interface or flight model or create new features. One such feature is the XSquawkBox plugin, which allows X-Plane users to fly on a worldwide shared air traffic control simulation network. Other work has been done in the area of improving X-Plane's flight model and even replacing entire facets of X-Plane's operation. Maps and scenery are fully editable. While no tool is provided to edit the 3D mesh objects, there are tutorials for using the third party 3D modelers AC3D, SketchUp, Blender, and Autodesk 3ds Max Network flight X-Plane can connect to other X-Plane instances via a UDP/IP or TCP/IP network for multiplayer flight simulation, networked multi-monitor X-Plane configurations or to plugins, such as Pilot Edge, which themselves communicate with other X-Plane instances. The X-Plane IOS (Instructor Operation Station) can be used remotely (via the Internet) or locally (via a computer connected to the X-Plane session by a LAN) as part of a flight training session allowing a flight instructor to alter and control the aircraft in various ways. It can be used to simulate various aircraft system failures and also to change the weather, time, or location. Utilities Multiple utilities are shipped with X-Plane 10/11 by Laminar Research for users to customize various aspects of the simulation. World Editor is an overlay editor with a graphic user interface to facilitate editing of airports. With the most recent update, this utility global resources to allow users to submit data to be included in X-Plane by default with each update. The primary purpose of this tool is to modify and correct airport layouts. World Editor also can read the geographical coordinates in GeoTIFF files. In version 1.3r1, a new feature was added to allow users to submit airports using default assets to an Airport Scenery Gateway. Commercial and professional use The professional use version of X-Plane includes all the features of the personal use version, but has more capabilities depending on the license used. A commercial use license can be used which allows one to use X-Plane without being tied to a specific computer via e.g. a disk or USB key. The commercial version also supports \\"kiosk mode\\" in which X-Plane's settings can be locked via password protection. The professional use version can also allow one to generate revenue from X-Plane related content. The professional use version allows FAA certified flight training hours to be logged, but the computer system running X-Plane must be tested to meet minimum frame-rate requirements and have its hardware and all associated simulation hardware tested to be FAA certified. Furthermore, FAA certification may require expensive simulation hardware ( e.g. professional flight simulation hardware ). The professional use version also enables the use of more advanced flight simulation hardware compared to the personal use version. For example, the professional use version is capable of cylindrical and spherical projection, which is commonly used in large and/or expensive professional flight simulators. The professional use version also has the ability to drive Garmin Real Simulator Units.

According to legend, his death at the hands of the indigenous Ta√≠no people ignited the Ta√≠no rebellion of 1511. Salcedo's death According to the story, Salcedo died in 1511, during a trip to Puerto Rico, when Ta√≠nos, under the command of Ag√ºeyban√° II (brother of the great Taino Cacique Ag√ºeyban√°) and the Cacique of A√±asco, Urayo√°n, drowned him in the R√≠o Grande de A√±asco. Historically, two versions about how Salcedo was lured to his death have collided. Many books assert that the soldier had been told he'd be taken to a lake filled with Ta√≠no women that he could have sex with, and, once there, he found not women, but men who then proceeded to drown him. The other version has Salcedo being offered a ride across a river by Ta√≠nos who carried him on their arms, and then drowned him and kept him for days, afraid he'd still be alive and waiting until they were certain he was dead. A third, and most accepted version of Salcedo's death says that the Tainos, fearing that the Spaniards might be gods, refrained from harming them. After suffering under the Spaniards for so long, the Tainos, by order of Ag√ºeyban√°, ambushed Salcedo as he was drinking water at the edge of a river. Fearing that Salcedo might resurrect after three days--based on their understanding of the Christian teachings wielded by Catholic priests--they sat around for three days waiting for Salcedo to come back from the dead, but all they saw was Salcedo's body rotting due to the heat just as they would. At that moment the Tainos realized that these were no gods. It was with Salcedo's death that the Ta√≠nos were encouraged to declare war on the Spaniards in Puerto Rico. This led to the Taino rebellion of 1511. However, the Tainos were quickly defeated due to the Spaniards' better weaponry and war expertise. After the death of Ag√ºeyban√° II, the native warriors retracted and became disorganized. Ag√ºeyban√° II's followers opted for engaging the Spaniards via guerilla tactics. Such guerilla warfare lasted for the next eight years, until 1519. A second round of raids erupted in 1513 when Ponce de Leon departed the island to explore Florida. The settlement of Caparra, the seat of the island government at that time, was sacked and burned by an alliance between Ta√≠nos and natives from the northeastern Antilles. By 1520 the Ta√≠no presence on the island had almost disappeared. A government census in 1530 reports the existence of only 1,148 Ta√≠nos remaining in Puerto Rico. However, oppressive conditions for the surviving Ta√≠no continued. Many of those who stayed on the island soon died either due to cruel treatment or the smallpox epidemic, which attacked the island in 1519. Legend A local legend tells of a ghostly Taino woman, supposedly Salcedo's lover, that still haunts the site of his drowning at A√±asco. This belief is exemplified by a verse in the town's anthem: Salcedo in popular culture Salcedo is referenced in a song of Puerto Rican rock band Fiel a la Vega. The song is titled \\"El Asunto: Salcedo Sigue Siendo Mortal\\" (The Issue: Salcedo is still a Mortal) and it makes a comparison between the Spaniards' rule in the island and the United States' invasion of 1898.

It is typically made with rice noodles, chicken, beef or tofu, peanuts, a scrambled egg, and bean sprouts, among other vegetables. The ingredients are saut√©ed together in a wok, which creates even heat distribution. Once the dish is completed it is tossed in pad thai sauce, which gives the dish its signature tangy salty flavor with a hint of sweetness. Ingredients Pad thai is made with rehydrated dried rice noodles with some tapioca flour mixed in, which are stir fried with eggs and chopped firm tofu, flavored with tamarind juice, fish sauce, dried shrimp, garlic or shallots, red chili pepper and palm sugar, and served with lime wedges and often chopped roasted peanuts. It may contain other vegetables like bean sprouts, garlic chives, pickled radishes or turnips, and raw banana flowers. It may also contain fresh shrimp, crab, squid, chicken or other animal proteins. Many of the ingredients are provided on the side as condiments, such as the red chili pepper, lime wedges, roasted peanuts, bean sprouts, spring onion and other miscellaneous fresh vegetables. Vegetarian versions may substitute soy sauce for the fish sauce and omit the shrimp entirely. History Though stir fried rice noodles were introduced to Thailand from China centuries ago, the dish pad thai was invented in the mid-20th century. Author Mark Padoongpatt maintains that pad thai is \\"...not this traditional, authentic, going back hundreds of years dish. It was actually created in the 1930s in Thailand by Plaek Phibunsongkhram, who was the prime minister at the time. The dish was created because Thailand was focused on nation building. So he created this dish using Chinese noodles and called it pad Thai as a way to galvanize nationalism.\\" Another explanation of pad thai's provenance holds that, during World War II, Thailand suffered a rice shortage due to the war and floods. To reduce domestic rice consumption, the Thai government under Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram promoted consumption of noodles instead. His government promoted rice noodles and helped to establish the identity of Thailand. As a result, a new noodle called sen chan (named after Chanthaburi Province) was created. Pad thai has since become one of Thailand's national dishes. Today, some food vendors add pork or chicken (although the original recipe did not contain pork because of the government's perception that pork was a Chinese meat). Some food vendors still use the original recipe. In popular culture * Pad thai is listed at number five on a list of \\"World's 50 most delicious foods\\" readers' poll compiled by CNN Go in 2011. * The Thai film Jao saao Pad Thai uses pad thai as a plot device as the protagonist claims she will marry whoever eats her pad thai for 100 days in a row.Jao saao Pad Thai (2004) - Plot Summary * In 2008, in an episode of Throwdown! with Bobby Flay, celebrity chef Bobby Flay was defeated by Chef Nongkran Daks at her restaurant, Thai Basil, in Chantilly, Virginia. * On 7 November 2017, a Google Doodle featuring pad thai was displayed in the United States, Canada, Cuba, Thailand, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, Israel, and several countries in both Europe and South America.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x7RCmTRMKE Google celebrated it as an initiative of Doodler Juliana.https://www.google.com/doodles/celebrating-pad- thai While she was researching how to prepare it, she aimed to show all the ingredients up close and with a colourful animation.

Cuautitl√°n Izcalli municipality was created in the 1970s, carved mostly out of Cuautitl√°n de Romero Rubio (now simply 'Cuautitl√°n'). Originally planned as the first self-sufficient city in the neighbourhood of Mexico City, the city's design was based on European and American cities and included an industrial, a residential and several green areas. After the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, however, the plans fell apart due to a large influx of people searching for zones, such as Cuautitl√°n Izcalli, with no seismic danger. Nowadays almost 75% of the municipality's residents work in nearby cities such as Satellite City and Mexico City, causing enormous congestion on the only highway available, the Perif√©rico. Several shopping malls have opened in recent years, including San Miguel, San Marcos, and Luna Parc, which compete with Perinorte to the south of the municipality. There is a Ford Motor Company plant, assembling Fiestas (F-Series before 2010), and a Bacardi spirits factory. Cuautitl√°n Izcalli is home of the Centro Episcopal Mexicano visited by Pope John Paul II during his 1991 visit to the country.

They are generally resident but some birds migrate south to winter in north Africa. They are rare vagrants to northern and western Europe. These are small, long tailed, large-headed birds, overall very similar to their close relatives in the Dartford warbler group. Marmora's warblers are grey above and below, lacking the brick-red underparts of the Dartford warbler. Adult males have darker patches on the forehead and between the eye and the pointed bill. The legs and iris are red. The song is a fast rattle. Immature birds can be confused with young Dartford warblers, which are also grey below, but Marmora's have a paler throat. Their iris is dark. These small passerine birds are found in open country with thorny bushes and heather. 3-5 eggs are laid in a nest in a bush. Like most warblers, they are insectivorous.

He was lead guitarist and one of the four founding members of heavy metal band Black Sabbath, and was the band's primary composer and sole continuous member for nearly five decades. Iommi was ranked number 25 in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \\"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\\". While working in a factory as a teenager, Iommi lost the tips of the middle and ring fingers of his right hand in an accident, an event which crucially impacted his playing style. He briefly left Black Sabbath (then known as Earth) in 1968 to join Jethro Tull, but did not record any material with the band, and subsequently returned to Black Sabbath in 1969. In 2000, he released his first solo album Iommi, followed by 2005's Fused, which featured his former bandmate Glenn Hughes. After releasing Fused, he formed Heaven & Hell, which disbanded after Ronnie James Dio's death in 2010. In 2011, he published his autobiography, entitled Iron Man: My Journey Through Heaven and Hell with Black Sabbath. Early life Iommi was born in Birmingham, the only child of Sylvia Maria (n√©e Valenti, born in Palermo) Iommi and Anthony Frank Iommi. Sylvia's family were vineyard owners in Italy. The family was Catholic, though they rarely attended Mass. Their family home in the Park Lane area of Aston also housed a shop which was a popular meeting place in the neighbourhood., with the living room doubling as the shop's stockroom. His mother ran the shop while his father was a carpenter by trade. Born and raised in Handsworth, Birmingham, Iommi attended Birchfield Road School, where future bandmate Ozzy Osbourne was also a student one year behind him. At age 8 or 9, while being chased by another boy, Iommi fell and suffered a bad cut on his upper lip. As a result, he gained the nickname \\"Scarface\\", which made him more self- conscious of the scar, so he eventually grew his trademark moustache as a means of covering it. At about age 10, Iommi began working out and learned judo, karate, and later boxing as a means of protecting himself from the local gangs which congregated in his neighbourhood. He envisioned a future as a bouncer in a nightclub. Iommi initially wanted to play the drums, but due to the excessive noise he chose the guitar instead as a teenager, after being inspired by the likes of Hank Marvin and the Shadows. He has always played guitar left-handed. After completing school, Iommi worked briefly as a plumber and later in a factory manufacturing rings. He stated that at one point he worked in a music store, but quit after being falsely accused of stealing. =Accident= At the age of 17, Iommi lost the tips of the middle and ring fingers of his right hand in an industrial accident on his last day of work in a sheet metal factory. Iommi described how he \\"was told 'you'll never play again'. It was just unbelievable. I sat in the hospital with my hand in this bag and I thought, that's it ‚Äì I'm finished. But eventually I thought 'I'm not going to accept that. There must be a way I can play'.\\" After the injury Iommi's factory foreman played him a recording of famous jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt, which encouraged him to continue as a musician. As Iommi later wrote: > \\"My friend said, \\"Listen to this guy play\\", and I went, \\"No way! Listening > to someone play the guitar is the very last thing I want to do right now!\\" > But he kept insisting and he ended up playing the record for me. I told him > I thought it was really good and then he said, 'You know, the guy's only > playing with two fingers on his fretboard hand because of an injury he > sustained in a terrible fire.' I was totally knocked back by this revelation > and was so impressed by what I had just heard that I suddenly became > inspired to start trying to play again.\\"Iommi, Tony (1997). \\"Never Say Die: > Overcoming overwhelming odds, and the right way to play 'Paranoid' .\\" > GuitarWorld, August, 1997. Inspired by Reinhardt's two-fingered guitar playing, Iommi decided to try playing guitar again, though the injury made it quite painful to do so. Although it was an option, Iommi never seriously considered switching hands and learning to play right-handed. In an interview with Guitar World magazine, he was asked if he was \\"ever tempted to switch to right-handed playing.\\" Iommi responded: > If I knew what I know now I probably would have switched. At the time I had > already been playing two or three years, and it seemed like I had been > playing a long time. I thought I‚Äôd never be able to change the way I played. > The reality of the situation was that I hadn‚Äôt been playing very long at > all, and I probably could have spent the same amount of time learning to > play right handed. I did have a go at it, but I just didn‚Äôt have the > patience. It seemed impossible to me. I decided to make do with what I had, > and I made some plastic fingertips for myself. I just persevered with it. He ultimately decided to continue playing left-handed. To do so, he fitted homemade thimbles to his injured fingers to extend and protect them; the thimbles were made from an old Fairy Liquid bottle ‚Äì \\"melted it down, got a hot soldering iron and shaped it like a finger\\" ‚Äì and cut sections from a leather jacket to cover his new homemade prosthetic, which created two technical problems. First, the thimbles prevented him from feeling the strings, causing a tendency to press down very hard on them. Second, he had difficulty bending strings, leading him to seek light-gauge guitar strings to make it easier to do so. However, Iommi recalls that such strings were not manufactured at the time, so he used banjo strings instead, until around 1970‚Äì71 when Picato Strings began making light-gauge guitar strings. Furthermore, he used the injured fingers predominantly for fretting chords rather than single-note solos. In 1974, Iommi told Guitar Player magazine that the thimbles \\"helped with his technique\\" because he had to use his little finger more than he had before the accident.Michael Molenda, ed. Guitar Player Presents Guitar Heroes of the 70s (Milwaukee, WI: Backbeat Books, 2011), 131. Later, he also began tuning his guitar to lower pitches, sometimes as far as three semitones below standard guitar tuning (e.g., on \\"Children of the Grave\\", \\"Lord of this World\\", and \\"Into the Void\\", all on the album Master of Reality). Although Iommi states that the main purpose of doing so was to create a \\"bigger, heavier sound\\", slackening the strings makes it easier to bend them. Iommi reflected in 2016 saying that his greatest regret is losing his fingertips. > It became a burden. Some people say it helped me invent the kind of music I > play, but I don‚Äôt know whether it did. It‚Äôs just something I‚Äôve had to learn > to live with. It affects your playing style; you can‚Äôt feel the strings, and > there are certain chords I can‚Äôt play. Right at the beginning I was told by > doctors: ‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt be playing guitar.‚Äù But I believed I could do it, and I > did.  Career  = Pre-Black Sabbath = Iommi had played in several blues/rock bands, one of the earliest of which was the Rockin' Chevrolets from 1964 to 1965. The band had regular bookings. Iommi later joined The Birds And Bees, and when they were offered work in Germany, Iommi decided to leave his factory job to take up the opportunity . From 1966 to 1967 Iommi played in a band named the Rest. It was in the Rest that Iommi first met future-Black Sabbath drummer Bill Ward, who played drums and sang in the band. From January until July of 1968 Iommi was guitarist in Mythology, with Ward joining a month later in mid-February. In May 1968 police raided the group's practice flat and found cannabis resin, which resulted in fines for the band members. Most significantly, the incident made it quite difficult for the band to secure future bookings as most club owners avoided bands they viewed as drug users. Mythology subsequently split up after a gig in Silloth on 13 July 1968. In August 1968 at the same time as the break-up of Mythology, another Birmingham band called Rare Breed also broke up. Vocalist Ozzy Osbourne joined with Iommi and Ward after the duo responded to an advert in a local music shop proclaiming \\"Ozzy Zig Requires Gig ‚Äì has own PA\\". Requiring a bassist, Osbourne mentioned his former Rare Breed bandmate Geezer Butler, who was subsequently hired along with slide guitarist Jimmy Phillips and saxophonist Alan \\"Aker\\" Clarke. The six-piece band were named the Polka Tulk Blues Band. After just two gigs (the last of which was at the Banklands Youth Club in Workington), Phillips and Clarke were dismissed from the band, which soon after shortened its name to Polka Tulk. = Earth and Jethro Tull= Iommi, Butler, Ward and Osbourne renamed the band Earth in September 1968. The same month Iommi briefly departed to join Jethro Tull. However, after only two performances (an appearance on \\"The Rolling Stones Rock & Roll Circus\\" in which the band mimed \\"A Song for Jeffrey\\", which Ian Anderson sang live and a live appearance at BBC), Iommi was back with Earth in November 1968. Concerning his brief working relationship with Jethro Tull vocalist Ian Anderson, Iommi said: > I learned quite a lot from him, I must say. I learned that you have got to > work at it. You have to rehearse. When I came back and I got the band > (Earth) back together, I made sure that everybody was up early in the > morning and rehearsing. I used to go and pick them up. I was the only one at > the time that could drive. I used to have to drive the bloody van and get > them up at quarter to nine every morning; which was, believe me, early for > us then. I said to them, \\"This is how we have got to do it because this is > how Jethro Tull did it.\\" They had a schedule and they knew that they were > going to work from this time till that time. I tried that with our band and > we got into doing it. It worked. Instead of just strolling in at any hour, > it made it more like we were saying, \\"Let‚Äôs do it!\\" =Black Sabbath = In August 1969, after being confused with another group named Earth (who had minor success in England), the group renamed themselves Black Sabbath. His factory accident affected the Black Sabbath sound; Iommi had detuned his guitar by 1971's Master of Reality album, lowering string tension and easing the pain to his fingertips. Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler did the same to match Iommi. Sabbath was among the first bands to detune, and the technique became a mainstay of heavy metal music. Iommi combined blues-like guitar solos and dark, minor-key riffing with a revolutionary high-gain, heavily distorted tone with his use of power chords, a modified treble-boosting effect-pedal and a Gibson SG. Tony Iommi in 1970 By the late 1970s, Black Sabbath were suffering from substance abuse, managerial problems, and touring exhaustion. In addition, the band's slow, blues-driven riffs were seen by some as outmoded against the rising generation of metal bands such as Judas Priest and Mot√∂rhead. After the albums Technical Ecstasy and Never Say Die! were not universally critically well received, Iommi and Butler decided that Sabbath needed a fresh start so, in the summer of 1979, they replaced Osbourne with Ronnie James Dio, the former vocalist for Rainbow. With Dio, Black Sabbath produced Heaven and Hell, an album that attempted to update Black Sabbath's sound for the 1980s and include the soaring vocals that characterised the NWOBHM (New wave of British heavy metal) scene. Halfway through the 1980 tour, Bill Ward dropped out due to alcohol problems and displeasure with the direction that Dio was taking the band. He was replaced by Vinny Appice. With Iommi and Geezer Butler the only original members, this line-up produced Mob Rules. Dio quit the following year to begin a solo career, so Sabbath went through a revolving door line-up for the next decade with a succession of frontmen ‚Äì Ian Gillan, Glenn Hughes, Ray Gillen and Tony Martin. After Ian Gillan (formerly of Deep Purple) departed the band in 1984, Geezer Butler left as well. With Sabbath in effective hiatus, Iommi recorded his first solo album, entitled Seventh Star. The album featured Glenn Hughes (also formerly of Deep Purple) on vocals, but due to label pressures, it was billed as a release by \\"Black Sabbath featuring Tony Iommi.\\" In 1992, Iommi appeared at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, playing four songs with the remaining members of Queen and other guest artists. Geezer Butler also returned to Sabbath that year. In the following year Iommi teamed up with fellow Black Country band Diamond Head and co-wrote the song \\"Starcrossed (Lovers in the Night)\\" for their 1993 Death and Progress album. At Osbourne's \\"farewell\\" concert at Costa Mesa in 1992, Dio refused to perform and abruptly left the band. As a result, Rob Halford was recruited to perform as the vocalist for two gigs (Halford also sang at one of the dates on the 2004 Ozzfest tour, when Osbourne couldn't perform due to bronchitis). Following Osbourne's solo set, the show concluded with the other members of the original Black Sabbath line-up joining for a 4-song reunion. Black Sabbath went on to record two further albums with Tony Martin before the original line-up reunited as a touring band in 1997. While Bill Ward played at the two initial reunion shows at Birmingham NEC in December 1997, he was not present for the following two reunion tours, his second absence due to a heart attack. Ward was replaced by Mike Bordin and then Vinny Appice. On 11 November 2011, the original band members announced that they were reuniting and recording a new album, although Bill Ward did not participate and Brad Wilk took his place at drums for the sessions. The new album, 13, was released in June 2013. = Solo career = In 2000, Iommi released his first proper solo album, titled Iommi. The album featured several guest vocalists including Ian Astbury, Skin, Henry Rollins, Serj Tankian, Dave Grohl, Billy Corgan, Phil Anselmo, Peter Steele and Ozzy Osbourne. In late 2004 Iommi's second solo album was released, entitled The 1996 DEP Sessions. This album was originally recorded in 1996 but was never officially released. However, a copy with a drum track by Dave Holland was available as a bootleg called Eighth Star. Glenn Hughes performed vocals on the album and he furthered his collaboration with Hughes with the release of his third solo album, Fused. Released on 12 July 2005, John Mellencamp drummer Kenny Aronoff completed the trio on the album. Iommi has signed with Mike Fleiss's movie production company Next Films to score a series of horror films entitled Black Sabbath. Since 1989 Tony Iommi was involved in the Rock Aid Armenia project. In October 2009 Iommi and his colleague Ian Gillan were awarded the Orders of Honor ‚Äì Armenia's highest order, which were delivered to them by the Prime Minister of Armenia for their help after the Spitak earthquake. They formed the supergroup WhoCares and recorded a single called \\"Out of my Mind\\", which was released 6 May 2011 for the benefit of the music school to be built in Gyumri, Armenia. In January 2012, when Iommi was announced to have stage 3 lymphoma, the Armenian Prime Minister sent a letter of support: \\"We know your spirit is strong as ever, and we do believe the genius of your inspiration that guides you through the work on the new Black Sabbath album will transform into a boost of strength and energy that you need now, when things look tough\\".Armenian PM sends a letter to Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi. 19.01.12 = Heaven & Hell = Star on Birmingham Walk of Stars In October 2006 it was reported that Iommi would tour with Ronnie James Dio, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward again, but under the name Heaven & Hell. Later it was announced that Ward had decided not to participate and Vinny Appice was hired as his replacement. Rhino Records released The Dio Years (under the 'Black Sabbath' moniker) album on 3 April 2007. The album showcased older tracks with Dio and also included three brand new songs recorded with Dio and Appice. The band started an American tour in April 2007 with Megadeth and Down as opening acts. The tour finished in November in England with the prospect of an album to follow in 2008. During this period the band's show at the New York Radio City Music Hall was released as both a live DVD and CD with a vinyl release in the UK in 2008. During the summer of 2008 the band embarked on the Metal Masters Tour along with Judas Priest, Mot√∂rhead and Testament. The band's first and only studio album, The Devil You Know, was released on 28 April 2009. In November 2008 Iommi had a star revealed on the Birmingham Walk of Stars. Dio died of stomach cancer in May 2010, and on 14 June 2010, Iommi announced that Heaven & Hell would perform a one-off tribute to Ronnie James Dio at the High Voltage Festival, London on 24 July 2010. This was the band's last performance under the name. = Eurovision Song Contest = Iommi wrote the song \\"Lonely Planet\\" which was sung by Dorians for Armenia in the 2013 Eurovision Song Contest. Personal life Iommi purchased his first house in Stafford, England, in 1972. He also purchased an adjacent property for his parents. Iommi has been married four times. *In late 1973 Iommi married Susan Snowdon, to whom he had been introduced by Black Sabbath's then-manager Patrick Meehan. The song \\"Fluff\\", an Iommi instrumental composition later released on the Sabbath Bloody Sabbath album, was played as Snowdon walked down the aisle. Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham was Iommi's best man for the ceremony. The marriage lasted for three years. Iommi said in a 1991 Guitar World interview that the troubled recording and mixing of Black Sabbath's 1976 album Technical Ecstasy contributed to the end of his marriage. *Iommi married an American model named Melinda in 1980. They had a daughter, Toni-Marie Iommi, in 1983, who was the vocalist for the now-defunct band LunarMile. Iommi divorced Melinda in the mid-1980s. When Toni-Marie was 12 years old, Iommi won custody of her after she was placed in foster care. Toni-Marie has described her early childhood with a mentally unbalanced mother as difficult but says that her father finally \\"saved her\\". She has stated that with her father she was able to regain her trust in other people. Mikko \\"Linde\\" Lindstr√∂m, guitarist with Finnish band HIM, became engaged to Toni-Marie in August 2010. In 2013, the couple were reported to have broken-up. *In 1986‚Äì87 Iommi met an Englishwoman named Valery, and after a six-year relationship they married. She had a son from a previous relationship named Jay. They divorced in the late 90s. Iommi confirmed in the same Guitar World interview referenced above (a co-interview with Metallica's James Hetfield) that he has a son. He told Hetfield regarding the band's so- called \\"Black Album\\", that \\"my son gave me a copy of your latest album...\\" *In 2005, Iommi married Maria Sj√∂holm, formerly vocalist for Swedish alternative metal band Drain STH. They met around 1998, when Tony was working on music for Drain STH. After a year of talking on the phone, in 1999, Maria relocated to England and moved into Tony's home. On 19 August 2005, without telling anyone, Maria and Tony married at the Sunset Marquis hotel, with only one witness present. On page 312 of his book, Tony calls the low-key wedding the \\"Best thing I ever did!\\" During the mid-1980s Iommi was briefly engaged to rock musician Lita Ford, formerly of The Runaways. Iommi co-produced her solo album The Bride Wore Black, which to date remains unreleased. Ford herself has said that her involvement with him during that period was strictly personal and that he had no involvement in the half-finished album. She said in a 1989 Kerrang! interview that \\"there's a certain amount of bad blood between Tony and I.\\" On 19 November 2013, Iommi received an Honorary Doctorate of Arts degree from Coventry University. The honorary degree came \\"in recognition of his contribution to the world of popular music\\", and recognized \\"his role as one of the founding fathers of heavy metal music and his status as one of the industry's most influential figures\\", the university said. Iommi is also a Visiting Professor of Music at Coventry University. Iommi holds dual British- Italian citizenship, acquiring Italian citizenship due to being born to an Italian mother. = Illness = In early 2012, Iommi was diagnosed with the early stages of lymphoma, for which he underwent successful treatment. Black Sabbath's 2013 tour dates were arranged so that Iommi was free to return to the UK once every six weeks to have an antibody administered. On 3 January 2014, in a New Year message, Iommi announced that he would be finishing his regular treatment some time that year. A few months later, Black Sabbath announced that due to Iommi's health issues, they were undertaking their final tour. As of 11 August 2016 Tony Iommi announced that his cancer was in remission. According to a report in Rolling Stone magazine from 9 December 2016, Iommi revealed that he was due to have an operation to remove a lump from his throat. In an early 2017 interview with the UK radio show Planet Rock, Iommi explained that the lump wasn't cancerous. =Religion= Iommi said in 2016 that he believed in God and was a Catholic, but that he had not attended church services since childhood. In January 2017, a choral work by Iommi entitled \\"How Good It Is\\" ‚Äì with lyrics inspired by Psalm 133 ‚Äì received its debut performance at Birmingham Cathedral. Catherine Ogle, the Dean of Birmingham, said, \\"This is a most wonderful gift Tony offered to the cathedral.\\" In his autobiography, Tony writes that his parents were Catholics but weren't regular churchgoers. He continues, 'I hardly go to church either. I wouldn't know what to do there. I actually do believe in a God, but I don't feel that I have to press the point.' Legacy and influence Iommi playing with Black Sabbath in 1978. Tony Iommi is widely considered to be one of the greatest rock guitarists of all time. In 2005, Metal Hammer magazine ranked him number 1 on the poll of the \\"Riff Lords\\", praising his \\"highly distinctive style of fretsmanship that's economical yet crushingly effective\\". In 2007, Classic Rock magazine ranked him number 6 on their list of the \\"100 Wildest Guitar Heroes\\". In 2011, Rolling Stone magazine ranked him number 25 in their list of the \\"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\\". Joel McIver ranked him the 6th greatest metal guitarist of all time. In 2012, readers of Guitar World ranked Iommi the 7th-greatest rock guitarist of all time. Editors of the same magazine ranked him the greatest heavy metal guitarist of all time. Iommi has won a number of awards. These include Q Awards (Gibson Les Paul Award, 2015), Kerrang! Awards (Icon, 2018), as well as three Grammy Awards won as a member of Black Sabbath. Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull has said: \\"Tony managed to turn his physical impairment around into something that makes him one of the guitar legends ‚Äì if not for his dexterity of playing but at least for the fact that his contribution to rock music is a unique one\\". Gene Simmons of Kiss regards him as \\"the man who came up with the riffs that launched an army of guitar players\\";Interview taken from the TV program Gene Simmons' Rock School, 2005 Ozzy Osbourne calls him \\"the master of the metal riff\\" and Ronnie James Dio called him \\"the ultimate riff master\\".Ian Christe, Sound of the Beast, HarperCollins, 2010, p.342 Furthermore, Iommi is recognised by many as the main creator of heavy metal music. Brian May of Queen considers him \\"the true father of heavy metal\\", Eddie Van Halen stated that \\"without Tony, heavy metal wouldn't exist. He is the creator of heavy!\\" and James Hetfield of Metallica, who was profoundly influenced by Iommi, defines him \\"The king of the heavy riff\\". Rob Halford, vocalist for Judas Priest, when filling in for Ozzy Osbourne during an August 2004 concert in Philadelphia, introduced Iommi to the audience as \\"The man who invented the heavy metal riff\\". Michael Amott of Carcass and Arch Enemy considers Iommi his \\"guitar hero\\" and the world's greatest guitarist \\"because he invented the heavy tone and evil riff\\". According to Lamb of God singer Randy Blythe, \\"Iommi is the reason heavy metal exists\\". He has been credited as the forerunner of other styles: Martin Popoff defines him \\"the godfather of stoner rock\\";CMJ New Music Monthly, April 2001, Num. 92, p.85 Jeff Kitts and Brad Tolinski of Guitar World assert that \\"grunge, goth, thrash, industrial, death, doom... whatever. None of it would exist without Tony Iommi\\".Jeff Kitts, Brad Tolinski, Guitar World Presents the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time!, Hal Leonard Corporation, 2002, p.8 According to Hawaii Public Radio: \\"it is hard to imagine Nirvana, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam or Alice in Chains without Black Sabbath, and without Tony Iommi. Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Scorpions, Metallica, Slayer, Pantera and essentially every metal band can be traced to the musical framework found in Iommi compositions\\". Many notable musicians count Iommi as a major influence on their own playing; some of them include Jeff Hanneman (Slayer), Dimebag Darrell (Pantera),Bob Gulla, Guitar Gods: The 25 Players who Made Rock History, ABC-CLIO, 2009, p.8 Slash (Guns N' Roses, Velvet Revolver), Scott Ian (Anthrax), Zakk Wylde (Ozzy Osbourne, Black Label Society), Tom Morello (Rage Against the Machine),Jon Wiederhorn, Katherine Turman, Louder Than Hell: The Definitive Oral History of Metal, HarperCollins, 2013 Billy Corgan (The Smashing Pumpkins), Kim Thayil (Soundgarden), and Nick Oliveri (Kyuss, Queens of the Stone Age). Jerry Cantrell of Alice in Chains was strongly influenced by Iommi's dark bendings, which he uses often. Andy LaRocque of King Diamond said that the clean guitar part of \\"Sleepless Nights\\" from the Conspiracy album is inspired by Iommi's playing on Never Say Die!. Equipment Iommi's deep and heavy sound was partly born out of necessity‚Äîhis \\"revolutionary signature sound\\" being the result of the accident and the subsequent downtuning by three semitones. He said that his \\"extreme volume\\" was likewise necessary, \\"because we were fed up with people talking over us while we were playing.\\" =Guitars= *Jaydee Custom SGs Built in Birmingham by luthier John Diggins sometime between 1975 and 1978, the guitar was first used for overdubs on the 'Heaven and Hell' album and later became one of Iommi's main guitars. The guitar is equipped with a 24 fret neck with custom cross inlays, four control knobs (three of which are functional), a disconnected second output jack, a hole for a master volume knob on the pick guard covered up with a black stopper and a highly distressed finish. He had two more built for him. One was made to the same specifications of his first Jaydee SG with a red finish. Another one was made and used during the Born Again era, which can be seen on the music videos for \\"Trashed\\" and \\"Zero the Hero.\\" The differences are the finish, headstock, use of a stoptail bridge, and use of rail humbuckers, as opposed to the 18-pole humbuckers on his two other versions. Tony Iommi's signature Gibson SG guitar *Gibson SG, aka \\"Monkey\\" A 1965 Gibson SG Special in red finish fitted with a Gibson P-90 pick-up in the bridge position and a custom-wound John Birch Simplux, a P-90 style single coil in the neck position. The guitar became Iommi's main instrument after his white Stratocaster's neck pick-up failed during the recording of Black Sabbath's self-titled album. It is currently on permanent display at the New York City Hard Rock Caf√©. *Gibson Custom Shop SG The guitar was built by the Gibson Custom Shop in Nashville after Iommi's specifications and finished in 1997. The guitar is one of two made as prototypes for the Gibson Custom Shop Limited Edition Iommi Special SG. The guitar features a neck with 24 frets and four control knobs, of which only two are active (much like his old Jaydee Custom guitar). On 11 August 2010, Iommi announced on his website that this guitar was stolen from the RJD tribute show that Heaven & Hell performed at High Voltage on 24 July 2010. He is asking that anyone with information or leads let them know. He is offering a reward for its safe return. *Epiphone P94 Iommi SG A stock Epiphone SG signature model in black finish fitted with P-94 pick-ups which is a version of the Gibson P-90 pick-up designed to fit into existing humbucker housings. *Gibson SG Standard A regular left-handed version of the SG fitted with two extra frets to give Iommi the full two octaves which he prefers. The guitar is equipped with his signature pick-up. Iommi was the first guitarist to have a signature pick-up designed and built by Gibson. He also has another model fitted with a Floyd Rose floating tremolo. *Fender Stratocaster Iommi played a Fender Stratocaster that was spraypainted white by Iommi and his father during the early days with Black Sabbath. However, the neck pick-up malfunctioned during the recording of their first album, so Iommi quickly turned to his backup Gibson SG to finish the record. Currently Iommi owns two Stratocasters, one of which has been modified with his signature pick-up in the bridge position. *St. Moritz Tony Iommi Custom SG Custom built for Iommi by St. Moritz guitars, this is a replica of Iommi's Gibson SG \\"Monkey\\". It was used on the 13 album and for the tour. *BC Rich Ironbird Custom built for Iommi by BC Rich. Features include Dimarzio pick-ups, two built-in preamps, scalloped fretboard and Iommi's trademark cross inlays. This guitar can be seen in Tony's Star Licks Video, for Star Licks Productions along with a left handed BC Rich mockingbird. *Gibson Barney Kessel A rare left-handed version of the jazz guitarist Barney Kessel artist model, built sometime in the first half of the 1960s. *Epiphone Riviera 12 string Originally a regular right-handed version in red finish that was converted by Epiphone to a left-handed version to fit Iommi. *LaBella custom gauge strings *Shure Wireless systems *A Gibson Tony Iommi Signature Pick Up has been available for the past two decades. The pick-up got its first ‚Äòblooding‚Äô on the Black Sabbath reunion/Ozzfest tour in the summer,of 1997, loaded into an SG that J.T. Riboloff of Gibson built. They also feature in the two SGs (one black and one red) that the Gibson Custom Shop built for Iommi in late 1997, as prototypes for the Tony Iommi special Custom Shop model. The pick-up is still in production, and available in silver, gold or black covers. It has been used in the Custom Shop models, the factory Iommi SG and most recently in the Epiphone Iommi SG. =Effects= *Boss chorus pedal *Boss octave pedal *Dallas Rangemaster Treble Booster *Drawmer LX22 compressor *Korg DL8000R multi-tap delay *Korg SDD1000 rackmount delay *Peavey Addverb III *Tycobrahe wah pedal =Amplifiers= *Laney TI100 Tony Iommi Signature: Current main amp.

Jason Ankeny, music critic for AllMusic, said Alexander was a \\"country-soul pioneer\\" and that, though largely unknown, \\"his music is the stuff of genius, a poignant and deeply intimate body of work on par with the best of his contemporaries.\\" Alexander's songs were covered by such stars as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Gerry and the Pacemakers, Otis Redding, Tina Turner and Jerry Lee Lewis. Career Alexander was born in Sheffield, Alabama, United States. Working with Spar Music in Florence, Alabama, Alexander recorded his first single, \\"Sally Sue Brown\\", under the name of June Alexander (short for Junior), which was released in 1960 on Jud Phillips' Judd Records. (Phillips is the brother of music pioneer Sam Phillips). A year later, Alexander cut \\"You Better Move On\\", at a former tobacco warehouse-turned-recording studio in Muscle Shoals. Released on Nashville's Dot Records, the song became a soul/R&B; chart hit, and laid the foundation for the modern recording studio FAME. \\"You Better Move On\\" is perhaps Alexander's best-known song, covered by the Rolling Stones, the Hollies, George Jones & Johnny Paycheck, Gene Clark (from The Byrds) and Mink DeVille. \\"Anna (Go to Him)\\", a U.S. R&B; Top Ten Hit, was covered by the Beatles, Roger McGuinn (from The Byrds) and Humble Pie. The Beatles also did live recordings of \\"Soldier of Love\\", which was also performed by Marshall Crenshaw and Pearl Jam, \\"A Shot of Rhythm and Blues\\", and \\"Where Have You Been\\" recorded live at the Star-Club in Hamburg, 1962. \\"Set Me Free\\" (covered by Esther Phillips and Joe Tex) were also major hits and established Alexander as a pioneering arranger of others' tunes, as well as an established songwriter in his own right. In 1962, Steve Alaimo was the first to record Alexander's \\"Every Day I Have to Cry\\", which reached No.46 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart. Dusty Springfield also recorded the song for her first UK solo EP, \\"I Only Want to Be With You\\", released on March 6, 1964. In the mid-1960s, Alexander switched to another label, Sound Stage 7, but failed to find commercial success. Although a 1972 album for Warner Brothers was promising, the singer's potential seemed to wither. He secured a pop hit with \\"Every Day I Have to Cry Some\\" on Buddah Records in 1975, but the success remained short-lived. The song was also covered by Ike and Tina Turner (produced by Phil Spector), the McCoys, Dusty Springfield, Joe Stampley, C.J. Chenier, Jerry Lee Lewis, The Gentrys and others. The follow-up single \\"Sharing The Night Together\\" (written by Muscle Shoals songwriters Ava Aldridge and Eddie Struzick) reached No. 92 on the R&B; charts, but earned Dr. Hook & the Medicine Show a Top 10 hit in 1978; the Dr. Hook version was used in the 2012 Family Guy episode \\"Mr. and Mrs. Stewie\\". For many years, Alexander was out of the music business; he was a bus driver for much of this time. In 1990, he was inducted into the Alabama Music Hall of Fame. He began to perform again in 1993 as renewed interest was shown in his back catalogue. His last album Lonely Just Like Me was his first in 21 years. He signed a new recording/publishing contract in May 1993 but suffered a fatal heart attack the following month, three days after performing in Nashville with his new band.

They are a type of G-protein found in the cytosol that are homologous to the alpha subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins, but unlike the alpha subunit of G proteins, a small GTPase can function independently as a hydrolase enzyme to bind to and hydrolyze a guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to form guanosine diphosphate (GDP). The best-known members are the Ras GTPases and hence they are sometimes called Ras subfamily GTPases. A typical G-protein is active when bound to GTP and inactive when bound to GDP (i.e. when the GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP). The GDP can be then replaced by free GTP. Therefore, a G-protein can be switched on and off. GTP hydrolysis is accelerated by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), while GTP exchange is catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). Activation of a GEF typically activates its cognate G-protein, while activation of a GAP results in inactivation of the cognate G-protein. Guanosine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDI) maintain small GTPases in the inactive state. Small GTPases regulate a wide variety of processes in the cell, including growth, cellular differentiation, cell movement and lipid vesicle transport.  The Ras superfamily  There are more than a hundred proteins in the Ras superfamily. Based on structure, sequence and function, the Ras superfamily is divided into five main families, (Ras, Rho, Ran, Rab and Arf GTPases). The Ras family itself is further divided into 6 subfamilies: Ras, Ral, Rit, Rap, Rheb, and Rad. Miro is a recent contributor to the superfamily. Each subfamily shares the common core G domain, which provides essential GTPase and nucleotide exchange activity. The surrounding sequence helps determine the functional specificity of the small GTPase, for example the 'Insert Loop', common to the Rho subfamily, specifically contributes to binding to effector proteins such as IQGAP and WASP. The Ras family is generally responsible for cell proliferation, Rho for cell morphology, Ran for nuclear transport and Rab and Arf for vesicle transport.

The term was coined by Dell Hymes in 1966, reacting against the perceived inadequacy of Noam Chomsky's (1965) distinction between linguistic competence and performance. To address Chomsky's abstract notion of competence, Hymes undertook ethnographic exploration of communicative competence that included \\"communicative form and function in integral relation to each other\\". The approach pioneered by Hymes is now known as the ethnography of communication. The notion of communicative competence is one of the theories that underlies the communicative approach to foreign language teaching. At least three core models exist. The first and most widely used is Canale and Swain's model and the later iteration by Canale. In a second model, sociocultural content is more precisely specified by Celce-Murcia, Dornyei, and Thurrell in 1995. For their part, they saw communicative competence as including linguistic competence, strategic competence, sociocultural competence, actional competence, and discourse competence. A third model widely in use in federal language training in Canada is Bachman and Palmer's model. The understanding of communicative competence has been influenced by the field of pragmatics and the philosophy of language, including work on speech acts. your bitcoinReferences Bibliography   Further reading * Category:Sociolinguistics Category:Language acquisition ","title":"Communicative competence"},{"id":"395753","text":"De Occulta Philosophia, Libri tres Man inscribed in a pentagram, from Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa's Three Books of Occult Philosophy. The signs on the perimeter represent the 5 visible planets in astrology. Three Books of Occult Philosophy (De Occulta Philosophia libri III) is Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa's study of occult philosophy, acknowledged as a significant contribution to the Renaissance philosophical discussion concerning the powers of ritual magic, and its relationship with religion. The first book was printed in 1531 in Paris, Cologne, and Antwerp, while the full three volumes first appeared in Cologne in 1533. The three books deal with Elemental, Celestial and Intellectual magic. The books outline the four elements, astrology, kabbalah, numbers, angels, God's names, the virtues and relationships with each other as well as methods of utilizing these relationships and laws in medicine, scrying, alchemy, ceremonies, origins of what are from the Hebrew, Greek and Chaldean context. These arguments were common amongst other hermetic philosophers at the time and before. In fact, Agrippa's interpretation of magic is similar to the authors Marsilio Ficino, Pico della Mirandola and Johann Reuchlin's synthesis of magic and religion, and emphasize an exploration of nature.

The village's main economic factors are oil and farming, namesake of the Coleville oilfields. The village is named for Malcolm Cole who became the community's first postmaster in 1908.  History  ;Early settlers In 1905, the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Company surveyed the area in preparation for a railway line, and the prospect of rail service attracted settlers to the area. The first settlers arrived in 1906, most of whom had shipped their effects to Battleford, the site of the Dominion Lands office in the area. With the nearest source of wood being on the banks of the South Saskatchewan River, approximately away, most of the first homes constructed in the area were sod houses, either frame structures covered with sods, or else built entirely out of sods. These structures generally collapsed after a few years, however one sod house built by English immigrant James Addison, between 1909 and 1911, has been occupied continuously from its construction to the present. The site for the Hamlet of Coleville was purchased from Charles Farris, and built on his purchased homestead NE 6-32-23-W3. In 1913, Charles Cole submitted names to the railway, and Coleville was chosen for the station and townsite. Coleville incorporated as a village on July 1, 1953. ;Railway The grade was built for the Biggar‚ÄìLoverna line of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway in 1912, and steel was laid in 1913. The construction of the rail site in Coleville began in 1913 with the construction of the railway station and coal box. Jack Binks, section foreman, was the station's first occupant, and George Barrett was the first station agent. After the construction of the station, a water well was required for the steam engines. In 1914 a two-pen, four-car stock yard and hog chute were built, and an 18 metre (60 foot) well was dug by hand. A pump house was built, and the Coleville water tower, which is still in use today, was erected. The first pumpman was Mike Crown. The Bigger‚ÄìLoverna line became part of the Canadian National Railway in 1923. The section toolhouse was built in 1926, and in 1953 a two-car loading platform was built, and an electric pump was installed in the pumphouse. The station was closed in 1979, and the tracks were torn up in 1998. ;Elevators Soon after the arrival of the railroad in 1913, a grain elevator was built by the Scottish Co-op. Bill Donald was its first agent. This original elevator was replaced in 1940 by a new elevator with a storage capacity of . The Alberta Pacific elevator was built in 1917, with Joe Barrows as its first agent. The elevator had a capacity of . It was bought out by Federal Grain in 1943. The Saskatchewan Wheat Pool was formed in 1924, and built an elevator in Coleville in 1925, now called Pool A. Alf Beal was the first operator. Pool A had a storage capacity of . In the late 1970s Pool A was sold and torn down. The Scottish Co-op elevator was purchased in 1948 by the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool and became Pool B. The Federal Grain elevator was acquired by the Pool in 1972, and became Pool C. Pool C was torn down in 1998. ;Coleville Post Office One of the first settlers was Malcolm Cole, who came with his father in 1906, and set up a post office and general store on his homestead shortly thereafter, in the summer of 1907. He named the post office Coleville, derived from his own last name, and the suffix -ville. His brother, Charles Cole, who arrived in 1907, was the postmaster from 1908 until 1917. Around 1914 the post office was moved from the Cole homestead to the townsite of Coleville. When John Brent turned the post office over to H. L. Dumouchel, the post office was moved to the Dumouchel store. Before railway service to the area, mail was carried in from Battleford. After the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway was built, the mail was carried from Scott by R. A. Cummings of Kerrobert. Cork obliterators (used to cancel stamps) in the second half of the 20th century are comparatively rare; however, cork obliterators created by H.L. Dumouchel (acting postmaster from 1928 until 1950) were still in use until they were lost in a post office remodelling sometime after 1951. ;Coleville Rural Telephone Co. The Coleville Rural Telephone Co. came into being on Friday, January 28, 1916, following a meeting of a group of ratepayers in Dumouchel's Drug Store. Shortly thereafter a charter was granted by the Department of Telephones and the company was started by issuing a debenture. On February 5, 1917, a tender of $11,298.40 by Heise, O'Bready and Small of Elstow was accepted for the construction of the system. The switchboard was located in the store of A. G. Bridger, who was also publisher of the district news sheet. Bridger resigned in 1919, and George Manning became secretary-treasurer and operator. His salary was $40 a month plus long distance commissions. In 1921 this increased to $60 a month. The linesman was Ed Hogarth, who was paid 50¬¢ an hour plus 10¬¢ for mileage. Subscribers paid an annual rental, which covered switching fees and operator costs. Landowners paid a tax levy on phone lines running through their property, which covered repairing and building lines. The levy was based on the quarters of land through which telephone lines ran. There were two rates. A quarter of land which had a line passing through it paid a 'straight' rate, and a quarter of land in which someone lived and had a phone paid a higher 'take-off' rate. Since the 'straight' rate levy was charged regardless of whether the owner had phone service, land owners without phones could be paying as much or more as land owners with phone service. In spite of attempts to reform this system, it remained in place until the government took over the service. In addition to the annual rental and line levy, there was a special levy to pay back the debenture. Financing for the company was always difficult, as the large rural population meant the construction and maintenance of many miles of poles and wire for each rural subscriber. In the early years, subscribers who could not pay rentals had their phone removed at their expense; however, by the time of the depression in the 1930s, this was no longer practical or desirable. Instead, subscribers were able to pay off their debt by assisting in the erection of new lines and the maintenance of old ones. Because of the difficulties associated with providing rural telephone service, it was resolved by the Rural Telephone Company as early as 1930 that they ask the provincial government to take over telephone operation for the entire province. While the government did finally take over telephone service, this did not occur until the late 1970s. Early on, use of the phones and the company's equipment was strictly regulated. There was a three-minute time limit for conversations. Those who did not have a phone were asked to pay 75¬¢ for using their neighbour's. Farmers and housewives faced fines or prosecution for the use of telephone poles as hitching posts, or incorporating them into their barbed wire fences or clotheslines. In 1935 George Manning died, and his wife carried on in his capacity until October 1, 1937, when Pat O'Bready, along with his wife Irene, took over as operator, linesman, and troubleman. They were paid $800 per year plus commissions, though this salary was on paper only. In 1940 the company began to emerge from the depression and gain solid financial footing, and in February 1942 the debenture debt was retired. In 1950, a wind storm on April 15 damaged or destroyed nearly the entire telephone system, which took six months to repair. In March 1954, Saskatchewan Government Telephones bought the Coleville Telephone plant for $2,301 while the Rural Company remained agent for the town. A new switchboard was installed, and private lines were made available. In 1956 black wall or desk cradle phones arrived, and the old box- crank phones were reclaimed. On July 1, 1957, Pat O'Bready resigned as linesman and operator, although he retained the post of troubleman. Six months later the Rural Company resigned as agent for the Government Telephones. By the 1960s, 24-hour service was being provided. Previously official hours had been from 8 a.m. until 9 or 10 p.m. (depending on season) on weekdays and Saturday, and from 10 a.m. until 2 p.m. on Sundays, although there was always someone available for emergencies. In 1965 the automatic dial system was completed, and calls were no longer routed through the operator. In 1967 the Coleville Rural Teleqhone Co. Ltd. was sold to the Kindersley Rural Telephone Co. Ltd. for $1, and Coleville was allowed one member to sit on the Kindersley board. In 1977 the government took over the Kindersley Rural Telephone Co.  Demographics  In the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Village of Coleville recorded a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change from its 2011 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016. In the 2011 Census of Population, the Village of Coleville recorded a population of , a change from its 2006 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2011.  Attractions  Amenities in the community include a library, a skating rink and a two-sheet curling rink. At nearby Laing's Park, also referred to as the three-mile park in reference to its distance from village, are several ball diamonds and a nine-hole golf course. The golf course once featured a pumpjack hazard.  Education  Coleville is located within the Sun West School Division. Children attend the Rossville School located within the community for kindergarten through grade 7. For grades 8‚Äì12, students are bused to Kindersley Composite School, located approximately twenty minutes away in Kindersley. The Warwick School was a one-room schoolhouse for the area that was closed in 1940. It was moved to Main Street in Coleville in 1946 where it served as the RM's office. When the RM moved to a new building in the 1980s, it continued to serve the community, first as the local Scout and Brownie hall, and now as a playschool.  Notable people  Jeni Mayer, author of such children's books as The Mystery of the Turtle Lake Monster and Suspicion Island, was born and raised in Coleville. Canadian artist, Jean A. Humphrey lived in Coleville for over 50 years.

Founded as a weekly review of politics and literature on 12 April 1913, it was connected then with Sidney and Beatrice Webb and other leading members of the socialist Fabian Society, such as George Bernard Shaw, who was a founding director. Today, the magazine is a print-digital hybrid. According to its present self-description, it has a liberal and progressive political position. Jason Cowley, the magazine's editor, has described the New Statesman as a publication \\"of the left, for the left\\" but also as \\"a political and literary magazine\\" with \\"sceptical\\" politics. The magazine was founded by members of the Fabian Society as a weekly review of politics and literature. The longest-serving editor was Kingsley Martin (1930‚Äì1960), and the current editor is Jason Cowley, who assumed the post in 2008. The magazine has recognised and published new writers and critics, as well as encouraged major careers. Its contributors have included John Maynard Keynes, Bertrand Russell, Virginia Woolf, Christopher Hitchens, and Paul Johnson. Historically, the magazine was affectionately referred to as \\"The Staggers\\" because of its crises of funding, ownership, and circulation. The nickname is now used as the title of its politics blog. Circulation was at its highest in the 1960s but has surged again in recent years.\\"New Statesman reaching more readers than ever\\", New Statesman, 12 February 2015. In 2016, the certified average circulation was 34,025. Traffic to the magazine's website that year reached a new high with 27 million page views and four million unique users. Associated websites are CityMetric, Spotlight and NewStatesman Tech. In 2018, New Statesman America was launched.  History  =Early years= The first issue of the New Statesman, 12 April 1913 The New Statesman was founded in 1913 by Sidney and Beatrice Webb with the support of George Bernard Shaw and other prominent members of the Fabian Society. The Fabians previously had supported The New Age but that journal by 1912 had moved away from supporting Fabian politics and issues such as women's suffrage. The first editor of the New Statesman was Clifford Sharp, who remained editor until 1928. Desmond MacCarthy joined the paper in 1913 and became literary editor, recruiting Cyril Connolly to the staff in 1928. J.C. Squire edited the magazine when Sharp was on wartime duties during the First World War. In November 1914, three months after the beginning of the war, the New Statesmen published a lengthy anti-war supplement by Shaw, \\"Common Sense About The War\\", a scathing dissection of its causes, which castigated all nations involved but particularly savaged the British. It sold a phenomenal 75,000 copies by the end of the year and created an international sensation. The New York Times reprinted it as America began its lengthy debate on entering what was then called \\"the European War\\". During Sharp's last two years in the post, from around 1926, he was debilitated by chronic alcoholism and the paper was actually edited by his deputy Charles Mostyn Lloyd. Although the Webbs and most Fabians were closely associated with the Labour Party, Sharp was drawn increasingly to the Asquith Liberals. Lloyd stood in after Sharp's departure until the appointment of Kingsley Martin as editor in 1930 ‚Äì a position Martin was to hold for 30 years. =1931‚Äì1960: Kingsley Martin= In 1931 the New Statesman merged with the Liberal weekly The Nation and Athenaeum and changed its name to the New Statesman and Nation, which it kept until 1964. The chairman of The Nation and Athenaeums board was the economist John Maynard Keynes, who came to be an important influence on the newly merged paper, which started with a circulation of just under 13,000. It also absorbed The Week-end Review in 1934 (one element of which survives in the shape of the New Statesmans Weekly Competition, and the other the \\"This England\\" feature). The Competition feature, in which readers submitted jokes and often parodies and pastiches of the work of famous authors, became one of the most famous parts of the magazine. Most famously, Graham Greene won second prize in a challenge to parody his own work. During the 1930s, Martin's New Statesman moved markedly to the left politically. It became strongly anti-fascist and pacifist, opposing British rearmament. After the 1938 Anschluss, Martin wrote: \\"Today if Mr. Chamberlain would come forward and tell us that his policy was really one not only of isolation but also of Little Englandism in which the Empire was to be given up because it could not be defended and in which military defence was to be abandoned because war would totally end civilization, we for our part would wholeheartedly support him.\\"The Anti- Appeasers (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1971), pp. 156‚Äì157. The magazine provoked further controversy with its coverage of Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union. In 1932, Keynes reviewed Martin's book on the Soviet Union, Low's Russian Sketchbook. Keynes argued that Martin was \\"a little too full perhaps of good will\\" towards Stalin, and that any doubts about Stalin's rule had \\"been swallowed down if possible\\". Martin was irritated by Keynes's article but still allowed it to be printed. In a 17 September 1932 editorial, the magazine accused the British Conservative press of misrepresenting the Soviet Union's agricultural policy but added that \\"the serious nature of the food situation is no secret and no invention\\". The magazine defended the Soviet collectivisation policy, but also said the policy had \\"proceeded far too quickly and lost the cooperation of farmers\\". In 1934 it ran an interview with Stalin by H. G. Wells. Although sympathetic to aspects of the Soviet Union, he disagreed with Stalin on several issues. The debate resulted in several more articles in the magazine; in one of them, George Bernard Shaw accused Wells of being disrespectful to Stalin during the interview. In 1938 came Martin's refusal to publish George Orwell's celebrated dispatches from Barcelona during the Spanish civil war because they criticised the communists for suppressing the anarchists and the left-wing Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM). \\"It is an unfortunate fact\\", Martin wrote to Orwell, \\"that any hostile criticism of the present Russian regime is liable to be taken as propaganda against socialism\\". Martin also refused to allow any of the magazine's writers to review Leon Trotsky's anti-Stalinist book The Revolution Betrayed. Martin became more critical of Stalin after the Hitler-Stalin pact, claiming Stalin was \\"adopting the familiar technique of the Fuhrer\\", and adding: \\"Like Hitler, he [Stalin] has a contempt for all arguments except that of superior force.\\" The magazine also condemned the Soviet Invasion of Finland. Circulation grew enormously under Martin's editorship, reaching 70,000 by the end of the Second World War. This number helped the magazine become a key player in Labour politics. The paper welcomed Labour's 1945 general election victory but took a critical line on the new government's foreign policy. The young Labour MP Richard Crossman, who had become an assistant editor of the magazine before the war, was Martin's chief lieutenant in this period, and the Statesman published Keep Left, the pamphlet written by Crossman, Michael Foot and Ian Mikardo, that most succinctly laid out the Labour left's proposals for a \\"third force\\" foreign policy rather than alliance with the United States. During the 1950s, the New Statesman remained a left critic of British foreign and defence policy and of the Labour leadership of Hugh Gaitskell, although Martin never got on personally with Aneurin Bevan, the leader of the anti- Gaitskellite Labour faction. The magazine opposed the Korean War, and an article by J. B. Priestley directly led to the founding of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. There was much less focus on a single political line in the back part of the paper, which was devoted to book reviews and articles on cultural topics. Indeed, with these pages managed by Janet Adam Smith, who was literary editor from 1952 to 1960, the paper was sometimes described as a pantomime horse: its back half was required reading even for many who disagreed with the paper's politics. This tradition would continue into the 1960s with Karl Miller as Smith's replacement. =1960-1996: After Kingsley Martin= Martin retired in 1960 and was replaced as editor by John Freeman, a politician and journalist who had resigned from the Labour government in 1951 along with Bevan and Harold Wilson. Freeman left in 1965 and was followed in the chair by Paul Johnson, then on the left, under whose editorship the Statesman reached its highest ever circulation. For some, even enemies of Johnson such as Richard Ingrams, this was a strong period for the magazine editorially. After Johnson's departure in 1970, the Statesman went into a long period of declining circulation under successive editors: Richard Crossman (1970‚Äì72), who tried to edit it at the same time as playing a major role in Labour politics; Anthony Howard (1972‚Äì78), whose recruits to the paper included Christopher Hitchens, Martin Amis and James Fenton (surprisingly, the arch anti-Socialist Auberon Waugh was writing for the Statesman at this time before returning to The Spectator); Bruce Page (1978‚Äì82), who moved the paper towards specialising in investigative journalism, sacking Arthur Marshall, who had been writing for the Statesman on and off since 1935, as a columnist, allegedly because of the latter's support for Margaret Thatcher; Hugh Stephenson (1982‚Äì86), under whom it took a strong position again for unilateral nuclear disarmament; John Lloyd (1986‚Äì87), who swung the paper's politics back to the centre; Stuart Weir (1987‚Äì90), under whose editorship the Statesman founded the Charter 88 constitutional reform pressure group; and Steve Platt (1990‚Äì96). The Statesman acquired the weekly New Society in 1988 and merged with it, becoming New Statesman and Society for the next eight years, then reverting to the old title, having meanwhile absorbed Marxism Today in 1991. In 1993, the Statesman was sued by Prime Minister John Major after it published an article discussing rumours that Major was having an extramarital affair with a Downing Street caterer. Although the action was settled out of court for a minimal sum, the magazine's legal costs almost led to its closure. In 1994, KGB defector Yuri Shvets said that the KGB utilised the New Statesman to spread disinformation. Shvets said that the KGB had provided disinformation, including forged documents, to the New Statesman journalist Claudia Wright which she used for anti-American and anti-Israel stories in line with the KGB's campaigns.The journal of intelligence history. International Intelligence History Association, p. 63. By 1996 the magazine was selling 23,000 copies a week. New Statesman was the first periodical to go online, hosted by the www.cleanroom.co.uk, in 1995. =Since 1996= The New Statesman was rescued from near-bankruptcy by a takeover by businessman Philip Jeffrey but in 1996, after prolonged boardroom wrangling over Jeffrey's plans, it was sold to Geoffrey Robinson, the Labour MP and businessman. Following Steve Platt's resignation, Robinson appointed a former editor of The Independent, Ian Hargreaves, on what was at the time an unprecedentedly high salary. Hargreaves fired most of the left-wingers on the staff and turned the Statesman into a strong supporter of Tony Blair's leadership of the Labour Party. Hargreaves was succeeded by Peter Wilby, also from the Independent stable, who had previously been the Statesmans books editor, in 1998. Wilby attempted to reposition the paper back \\"on the left\\". His stewardship was not without controversy. In 2002, for example, the periodical was accused of antisemitism when it published an investigative cover story on the power of the \\"Zionist lobby\\" in Britain, under the title \\"A Kosher Conspiracy?\\". The cover was illustrated with a gold Star of David resting on a Union Jack. Wilby responded to the criticisms in a subsequent issue. During Wilby's seven-year tenure, the New Statesman moved from making a financial loss to having a good operating profit, though circulation only remained steady at around 23,000. John Kampfner, Wilby's political editor, succeeded him as editor in May 2005 following considerable internal lobbying. Under Kampfner's editorship, a relaunch in 2006 initially saw headline circulation climb to over 30,000. However, over 5,000 of these were apparently monitored free copies, and Kampfner failed to maintain the 30,000 circulation he had pledged. In February 2008, Audit Bureau Circulation figures showed that circulation had plunged nearly 13% in 2007. Kampfner resigned on 13 February 2008, the day before the ABC figures were made public, reportedly due to conflicts with Robinson over the magazine's marketing budget (which Robinson had apparently slashed in reaction to the fall in circulation). In April 2008, Geoffrey Robinson sold a 50% interest in the magazine to businessman Mike Danson, and the remainder a year later. The appointment of the new editor Jason Cowley was announced on 16 May 2008, but he did not take up the job until the end of September 2008. In January 2009, the magazine refused to recognise the National Union of Journalists, the trade union to which almost of all its journalists belonged, though further discussions were promised but never materialised.Amos, Owen \\"New Statesman management to discuss NUJ recognition\\", UK Press Gazette, 16 January 2009. Retrieved 4 February 2009. Cowley was named current affairs editor of the year at the British Society of Magazine Editors awards in 2009, and in 2011 he was named editor of the year in the Newspaper & Current Affairs Magazine Category at the British Society of Magazine Editors awards, while Jon Bernstein, the deputy editor, gained the award for Consumer Website Editor of the Year. Cowley had been shortlisted as Editor of the Year (consumer magazines) in the 2012 PPA (Professional Publishers Association) Awards. He was also shortlisted for the European Press Prize editing award in January 2013, when the awards committee said: \\"Cowley has succeeded in revitalising the New Statesman and re-establishing its position as an influential political and cultural weekly. He has given the New Statesman an edge and a relevance to current affairs it hasn‚Äôt had for years.\\"\\"Jason Cowley  NOMINEE OF THE ‚Äô13 Distinguished award\\" , European Press Prize. The magazine published a 186-page centenary special in April 2013, the largest single issue in its history. It also published two special editions (250 and 150 pages), showcasing 100 years of the best and boldest journalism from its archives. In the following year it expanded its web presence by establishing two new websites: May2015.com, a polling data site focused on the 2015 general election, and CityMetric, a cities magazine site under the tagline, \\"Urbanism for the social media age\\" and edited by Jonn Elledge. It was announced in December 2016 that the Weekend Competition, a feature inherited from The Week-end Review, would be discontinued, for reasons of space. As of 2017, the New Statesman considers itself a \\"print-digital hybrid\\" with peak online traffic of over 4 million unique visitors per month, almost a four-fold increase since 2011. This compares to the magazine circulation of 35,000, almost a third of which is given away for free each month.https://www.abc.org.uk/Certificates/49272086.pdf At the 2017 British Society of Magazine Editors (BSME) awards, editor Jason Cowley was named Current Affairs and Politics editor of the year for the third time, defeating rivals from The Spectator, The Economist and Prospect. \\"The winning title is consistently fresh and thought provoking. In a very strong category it stood out for its eloquence and independent views\\", the BSME judges said on presenting the award. The magazine's Spotlight series (which publishes specialist business content) also won the Launch of the Year award, with judges describing the supplements as a \\"great example of monetising a brand without losing its integrity\\". The New Statesman took a neutral position in the 2019 general election. It was the first time in the magazine's history it had explicitly chosen not to endorse Labour. Guest editors In March 2009 the magazine had its first guest editor, Alastair Campbell, the former head of communications for Tony Blair. Campbell chose to feature his partner Fiona Millar, Tony Blair (in an article \\"Why we must all do God\\"), football manager Alex Ferguson, and Sarah Brown, the wife of Prime Minister Gordon Brown. This editorship was condemned by Suzanne Moore, a contributor to the magazine for twenty years. She wrote in a Mail on Sunday article: \\"New Statesman fiercely opposed the Iraq war and yet now hands over the reins to someone key in orchestrating that conflict\\". Campbell responded: \\"I had no idea she worked for the New Statesman. I don't read the Mail on Sunday. But professing commitment to leftwing values in that rightwing rag lends a somewhat weakened credibility to anything she says.\\" In September 2009, the magazine was guest- edited by Labour politician Ken Livingstone, the former mayor of London. In October 2010, the magazine was guest-edited by British author and broadcaster Melvyn Bragg. The issue included a previously unpublished poem by Ted Hughes, \\"Last letter\\", describing what happened during the three days leading up to the suicide of his first wife, the poet Sylvia Plath. Its first line is: \\"What happened that night? Your final night.\\"‚Äîand the poem ends with the moment Hughes is informed of his wife's death. In April 2011, the magazine was guest- edited by human rights activist Jemima Khan. The issue featured a series of exclusives including the actor Hugh Grant's secret recording of former News of the World journalist Paul McMullan, and a much-commented-on interview with Liberal Democrat leader and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, in which Clegg admitted that he \\"cries regularly to music\\" and that his nine-year-old son asked him, \\"'Why are the students angry with you, Papa?'\\" In June 2011, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, created a furore as guest editor by claiming that the Coalition government had introduced \\"radical, long term policies for which no one had voted\\" and in doing so had created \\"anxiety and anger\\" among many in the country. He was accused of being highly partisan, notwithstanding his having invited Iain Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary to write an article and having interviewed the Foreign Secretary William Hague in the same edition. He also noted that the Labour Party had failed to offer an alternative to what he called \\"associational socialism\\". The Statesman promoted the edition on the basis of Williams' alleged attack on the government, whereas Williams himself had ended his article by asking for \\"a democracy capable of real argument about shared needs and hopes and real generosity\\". In December 2011 the magazine was guest-edited by Richard Dawkins. The issue included the writer Christopher Hitchens's final interview, conducted by Dawkins in Texas, and pieces by Bill Gates, Sam Harris, Daniel Dennett and Philip Pullman. In October 2012 the magazine was guest-edited by Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei and, for the first time, published simultaneously in Mandarin (in digital form) and English. To evade China's internet censors, the New Statesman uploaded the issue to file-sharing sites such as BitTorrent. As well as writing that week's editorial, Ai Weiwei interviewed the Chinese civil rights activist Chen Guangcheng, who fled to the United States after exposing the use of compulsory abortions and sterilisations. The issue was launched on 19 October 2012 at the Lisson Gallery in London, where speakers including artist Anish Kapoor and lawyer Mark Stephens paid tribute to Ai Weiwei. In October 2013 the magazine was guest-edited by Russell Brand, with contributions from David Lynch, Noel Gallagher, Naomi Klein, Rupert Everett, Amanda Palmer, and Alec Baldwin, as well as an essay by Brand. In October 2014, the magazine was guest-edited by the artist Grayson Perry, whose essay titled \\"Default Man\\" was widely discussed. The former British prime minister Gordon Brown guest-edited the magazine in 2016, a special edition exploring Britain's relationship with Europe ahead of the EU referendum. Contributors to the issue included the Nobel laureate Amartya Sen and Michael Sandel.

Landmarks in Georgian Literature. School of Oriental and African Studies, 1966, p. 20 It tells the friendship of two heroes, Avtandil and Tariel, and their quest to find the object of love, Nestan-Darejan, an allegorical embodiment of Queen Tamar. These idealized heroes and devoted friends are united by courtly love, generosity, sincerity, dedication, and proclaim equality between men and women, which is a recurring theme. The poem is regarded as the \\"coronation of thought, poetic and philosophical art of medieval Georgia\\",Asatiani & Bendianashvili, p. 151 a complex work with rich and transcending genres.

This is one of 35 paintings made by Zichy under an 1881 commission by Georgian intelligentsia. Impressed by the poem, the artist donated all his works to the Georgian people, refusing any payment. =Context and time= The poem was written during the Golden Age of the Kingdom of Georgia and the reign of Queen Tamar, who was enthroned by her father King George III of Georgia. Tamar was celebrated by poets for her beauty, intelligence, and diplomatic skills. She expanded the Georgian kingdom to its historical maximum, repulsed invasions, and established protectorates over many area Muslim and Christian lands. Under her reign, the economy prospered. Georgian trading caravans reached Ayyubid Egypt, the Kievan Rus, and the Byzantine Empire. Medieval science developed, and the largest monasteries and churches in Georgia were built. Secular literature developed to the point of equaling the greatest religious texts. Against the backdrop of this \\"remarkable growth\\", Shota Rustaveli composed his poem.Polet, p. 500 Rustaveli, a Meskhetian from the south-western Georgian town of Rustavi, was close to Queen Tamar and possibly served as her treasurer.Polet, p. 525 He likely participated in many military campaigns. The stories in his poem are set in faraway lands, but his allegorical representations of contemporaneous Georgia are recognizable. For instance, he refers to wine culture and a female king who became an heir of her father.Kveselava, p. 13 In the prologue, Rustaveli says that he wrote this poem to praise the \\"King\\" Tamar. And in the epilogue (given here with a formal paraphrase), he praises the queen's king consort David Soslan. Content and form =Title= Georgian title () literally means \\"one with a skin of \\". The identity of the animal that it refers to is not certain and it can be a tiger, panther or leopard. In modern Georgian, it refers to the tiger. However, according to more modern research it would rather mean a panther. Similarly, the qualification of \\"knight\\" is not derived from the original title and its alternative translations exist, such as the \\"valiant\\" or simply a \\"man.\\"Orbeliani & Iordanishvili, 1949 The alternative English titles of the poem also are \\"Lord of the Panther Skin\\"Rustaveli, SUNY Press, 1977 and \\"The Man in the Panther's Skin\\".Rustaveli, Netlancers Inc, 2014 =Story= The story can be divided into two parts: the first part is Avtandil's quest for Tariel, the titular \\"knight in the panther's skin\\", and the second part is Avtandil's quest for Nestan-Darejan, Tariel's love. Search for Tariel Tariel, the knight in the panther's skin, Mih√°ly Zichy illustration. The King of Arabia, Rostevan, has no sons and confers the kingship on his only daughter, the beautiful and wise Tinatin. She has a tender affection for Avtandil, the knight and commander-in-chief of Rostevan's armies. One day, Avtandil challenges King Rostevan to a hunting competition. After three days of shooting game, they encounter a knight crying by a river. He is dressed in a panther's skin, and kills the slaves sent by the king to contact him, then disappears. Rostevan sends parties across the world to search for the mysterious knight, but becomes disheartened when he fails. Tinatin asks Avtandil to find the strange knight in three years, promising him her hand in marriage in return. After two years and nine months of searching, Avtandil finds the knight in the panther's skin hiding in a cave, with only a maiden for company. His name is Tariel, son of King Saridan, who has the seventh kingdom of India. He had served as heir to King Pharsadan, king of the other six kingdoms, for many years before falling in love with Pharsadan's daughter, Nestan-Darejan. Tariel wages war with the Khatavians to earn the favor of Nestan, but is dismayed to learn that she has already been promised to the Khwarezmian prince. Tariel could not bear the idea of her marriage, and at Nestan's request, he killed the suitor. The princess was placed on a boat and set adrift on the seas. Despite Tariel's lengthy search for his love, he could not find her. Later he met Nuradin- Phridon, ruler of Mulgazanzar, who told him that Nestan was alive but trapped on a distant boat. Tariel retired to a cave to live in the wilderness with Asmat, the former servant and messenger of Nestan. Moved by this story, Avtandil promises his friendship and brotherhood to Tariel, and agrees to help him find his love, Nestan-Darejan. Avtandil returns home to Arabia, and tells Tinatin the story of Tariel. Against King Rostevan's wishes, he returns to his new friend.The Knight in the Panther's Skin, III-XXX Search for Nestan- Darejan Avtandil then leaves Tariel to go to the kingdom of Phridon, where he does not hear anything new about Nestan. Continuing his quest, he arrives in the city of Gulansharo. He meets Patman, the wife of the chief Usen, who falls in love with him. Avtandil, sensing she knows the fate of Nestan, succumbs to Patman's seduction. She tells him she has been keeping Nestan at her place and, as Nestan was promised to the king's son, she helped her escape, but in her flight Nestan was abducted by Kaji the demon king. Avtandil then returns home to Phridon and to the cave of Tariel and later all three friends decide to go to the country of Kaji with an army of three hundred men to find and deliver Nestan. When she is released, all return to Arabia, where King Rostevan forgives Avtandil his flight and breaking the king's order. They all celebrate the marriage of the latter with the king's only daughter, Tinatin. They then leave for India where Tariel marries his love Nestan. Phridon also returns to his homeland and the three friends reign happily with prosperity and generosity in their own respective realms.The Knight in the Panther's Skin, XXX-XLV Places and characters Tariel, Avtandil and Pridon looking at the Kajeti fortress, Mih√°ly Zichy illustration. =Places= The poem is placed far away from Georgia in countries that the poet has certainly never visited: Arabia, India and \\"Khataeti\\" that is to say, China. The indications are vague and not designate any particular site.Beynen, p. 221 It is the Georgian kingdom that has existed through these distant lands. It seems that the choice of places refers primarily to the national character of these peoples: the Arabs are portrayed as more rational, as the king Rostevan and his knight Avtandil with their communication skills and action help to break deadlocks. Conversely, the Indians appear to be more emotional and impulsive and cause unintended disasters, as of the image of Tariel and Nestan.Beynen, p. 219 Other locations mentioned as the Kajeti or country of Kaj demons are imaginary. Gulansharo, capital of the \\"Kingdom of the Seas\\", has been compared to Venice.Beynen, p. 222 =Characters= ;The brave and loyal knights ‚Äî Avtandil and Tariel These two characters represent the most devouted and friend lover characters, both heroes capable of courtly love and men endowed with free will.Beynen, p. 228 They initially were actively involved and served the kingdoms held position of modern \\"steward\\" or \\"Mayor of the Palace\\".Delshad, p. 50 Besides their position they only obey their beloved therefore their love and dedication is unwavering. The mutual commitment and friendship they swear, also extends to a third person, Nuradin-Pridon, who is also endowed with the same heroic qualities. Tariel is however distinguished by his wild character as he's attributeed with the panther's skin. The qualities associated with him of animal what is the power, intelligence or passion adds the impression of his feelings, his dedication and courage, as his hatred and violence could be extreme and uncontrollable.Polet, p. 548 It is also close to Saint George slaying the dragon whose cult was particularly strong in the 12th century especially in the episode where Tariel kills a lion and a panther.Mirianaschwili, M√ºller & M√ºller, ¬´Schota Rustaveli, \\"Der Ritter im Tigerfell\\", 1999 ;The faithful and patient lovers ‚Äî Tinatin and Nestan- Darejan Although they take little action, these female characters, Tinatin and Nestan-Darejan are constantly present in thoughts of the knights and in the narrative tension as a whole. Princesses, a higher rank than their servant knights, they are inspired by the Queen Tamar or reflect the fact that each of them is the sovereign in their own realm.Wardrop, p. 6 Tinatin chooses her own husband, and it references to Queen Tamar as her role of the king and his father Rostevan, ceding his throne to his daughter references King George III of Georgia who was succeeded by her daughter in 1178, after his death.Beynen, p. 220 Tinatin is a static character who leaves no time to the court of his father in Arabia. Nestan being a prisoner in the distant regions, is also passive. But their confidence, righteousness, shows these two women being faithful and respective lovers. As for Patman, she is an altered representation of their type but an infidel during the absence of her husband.Wardrop, p. 7 Patman takes little account of family honor as she humiliates her husband on account of his bodily defects. Patman's character is true to life from the artistic point of view. Despite everything, she is capable of displaying both affection and sincere warmth peculiar to a woman. She spares no effort to save Nestan. It is very characteristic that when Patman learns of the purpose of Avtandil's journey, she makes no attempt to keep the man she loves at her side even for a short time.Baramidze & Gamezardashvili, p. 25 Human relationships Rustaveli is a great humanist. The poet focuses his attention on a man as a complex of sincere feelings, emotions, passions and aspirations. To counterbalance the mentality of the Middle Ages and the ecclesiastic morality of asceticism, Rustaveli proclaims the freedom of man as a personality, free of thought and feeling.Baramidze & Gamezardashvili, pp. 25-26 =Love= In the prologue, Rustaveli describes three types of love: inaccessible, heavenly love; physical love; and finally, a higher earthly love, or passionate love.Baramidze & Gamezardashvili, p. 21 Rustaveli thinks that pure and constant love does not expect love in return.Wardrop, p. 4 Such love can not be felt without a strong spirit; he suggests that the only possibility of enjoying love of this order is to have the natural qualities of a true human being. The valiant must win his beauty by impeccable behavior, including a constant devotion, the rejection of social duties, and selfless loyalty. And as the author says, \\"love is a severe trial for man as for woman\\".Baramidze & Gamezardashvili, pp. 21-22 Nestan's loyalty is expressed in the dramatic tension well before the appearance of her character; he is a model of righteousness. When it was announced that Nestan would be married against her will, she protests with force, and supports the consequences by her heroic courage and stoicism. For the three heroes who go to her aid, fearless and selfless, their fight is intended as a quest for justice. Amorous conquest is noticeably absent from the poem. Both romantic relationships are paralleled and never mixed, as the true brotherhood between the two heroes prevent such incidents.Beynen, p. 232 Love, like friendship, often gives rise to hyperbolic descriptions in the poem.Wardrop, p. 7 =Friendship= The friendship between the three heroes sworn, Avtandil, Tariel and Pridon, a clear narrative of the entire epic, binds them together and at the same time it binds their peoples. These three men belong to different nations, they find themselves with the same aspirations and the same goal and that is their union of forces that can and will destroy a tyranny and evil what is represented by the Kajs.Baramidze & Gamezardashvili, p. 23 This friendship, full of honesty and courage, free of cowardice and sycophancy, must go to the death if necessary. Such friendship is also possible between persons of different sexes in this case of Tariel and Asmat who share the same cave in brotherhood. However, love and friendship are intertwined as love of a knight with his heroism is fully realized with the help of a disinterested friendship and absolute loyalty. Both feelings are also expressed in the terms when Avtandil even against the will and order of his king departs to help his friend in need. Moreover, the happiness of each is conditioned by the happiness of others. Tinatin allows Avtandil to leave for Tariel, because it is the duty of her suitor to rescue his friend to whom he has promised to help.Polet, p. 527 Morals, religion and philosophy =Values= With the glorification of courtly love, Rustaveli leads to strongly condemn forced marriages. Poem also shows an admiration for the woman and demands for gender equality. Even though Queen Tamar is the first female monarch and the sovereign of the kingdom, women's political function, position and leading role in Georgia was very high be it the patronage of Georgia by the Virgin Mary or conversion of Georgians to Christianity by a woman, Saint Nino in the 4th century.Shengelia, p. 107 This \\"cult of woman\\"Baramidze & Gamezardashvili, p. 22 celebrates her honor and freedom to choose her own husband and Nestan is the model of a noble woman who puts reason above passion. In equal rights, women can develop a sincere friendship with the opposite sex without love and desire and Asmat is dedicated to Tariel. Slavery is also condemned in the poem.Khakhanoff, p. 95 Politically, the poem does not lack and is not without patriotism. The state must be led by a strong and autocratic central government, however, sovereigns must rule with justice and prudence.Baramidze & Gamezardashvili, p. 24 In general, the poem is a \\"manifest of living with joy\\". The success of the three heroes in the liberation of Nestan shows that justice can exist on earth, as with enough courage and perseverance, one can find the happiness here.Baramidze & Gamezardashvili, p. 20 =Religious and philosophical views= The poem sometimes gives the impression of being a pagan work.Rayfield, p. 77 In fact, there are no prayers in the poem, and no references to Christ, the Virgin Mary, or the Trinity. However, Paul the Apostle is mentioned, and there are a number of references to the Gospels and the Old Testament, including ten occurrences of the Garden of Eden, as well as references to the Euphrates, Gibeon and Levi).Wardrop, p. 270 Nevertheless, the moral framework of the work is Christian, with a clear dichotomy between a good god and a hard and disappointing world. This Christianity is not, however, fanatical. Rustaveli refers to the Quran multiple times to indicate that most of the characters are Muslim. He never offends Islam in his work and uses it as an allegory for Christianity, since most of the values that the poem promotes are of Christian origin. He also mentions the twelve apostles (verse 799) and how they spread the philosophy of benevolence and love. There are philosophical references in the poem to the work of Pseudo-Dionysius (verse 1478) which may be attributed to the influence of the Georgian monk Peter the Iberian, an idealist, who believed in the oneness of God but sees the impossibility of knowing God's real existence.Rayfield, pp. 77-78 Rustaveli's presentation of God as a universal force rather than a Christian one once led to the suppression of the poem. Believing Rustaveli was a Muslim, the Georgian Orthodox Church in the past destroyed copies of the poem. Translations Within Georgia, the poem has been translated into other Kartvelian languages like Laz, Svan and Mingrelian languages. Outside of Georgia, interest in the poem first appeared in 1802, when Eugene Bolkhovitinov published a verbatim translation of the first stanza of the poem into Russian.Bolkhovitinov, –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–µ –∏–∑–æ–±—Ä–∞–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ –ì—Ä—É–∑–∏–∏ –≤ –ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–º, —Ü–µ—Ä–∫–æ–≤–Ω–æ–º –∏ —É—á–µ–±–Ω–æ–º –µ–µ —Å–æ—Å—Ç–∞—è–Ω–∏–∏, St. Petersburg, 1802 In France in 1828, Marie-F√©licit√© Brosset made his first partial French translation.Brosset, pp. 277-294 In the 19th century the poem saw full translations into Polish,Lapchinski & Eristavi, 1840 GermanDer Mann in Tigerfelle, von Schota Rustaveli, Arthur Leist, 1889 online version and Russian. In 1845, extracts were published in Russian, French and Armenian. Vahan Terian, a prominent Georgian-born Armenian poet, translated the prelude, which was first published posthumously in 1922. It was praised by Nicholas Marr. In 1912, Marjory Wardrop published the first English translation available.Taktakishvili & Urushadze, pp. 142-148 In 1968, a verse translation by Venera Urushadze was published in Georgia. In 2015, an English poetic translation by Lyn Coffin was published, combining literary achievement with academic precision.

Its highest point is Paulina Peak. The largest volcano in the Cascade Volcanic Arc, Newberry has an area of when its lava flows are taken into account. From north to south, the volcano has a length of , with a width of and a total volume of approximately . It was named for the geologist and surgeon John Strong Newberry, who explored central Oregon for the Pacific Railroad Surveys in 1855. The surrounding area has been inhabited by Native American populations for more than 10,000 years. The volcano contains a large caldera, in diameter, known as the Newberry Caldera. Within the caldera are two lakes: Paulina Lake and East Lake. The volcano and its vicinity include many pyroclastic cones, lava flows and lava domes; Newberry has more than 400 vents, the most of any volcano in the contiguous United States. Glaciers may have once been present at the volcano, though this remains contested. The area has a dry climate with low precipitation levels and little surface runoff. The origin of the volcano remains somewhat unclear; while some scientists believe it originated from an independent hotspot, most evidence indicates that it formed from the subduction of the oceanic Juan de Fuca and Gorda tectonic plates under the continental North American Plate. Eruptive activity at Newberry Volcano began about 600,000 years ago and has continued into the Holocene, the last eruption taking place 1,300 years ago. Unlike other shield-shaped volcanoes, which often erupt basaltic lavas only, Newberry Volcano has also erupted andesitic and rhyolitic lavas. A popular destination for hiking, fishing, boating, and other recreational activities, the volcano lies within of 16,400 people and within of nearly 200,000 people, and it continues to pose a threat to life. Still considered an active volcano, it could erupt and produce lava flows, pyroclastic flows, lahars (volcanically induced mudslides, landslides, and debris flows), ashfall, earthquakes, avalanches, and floods. To track this threat, the volcano and its surroundings are closely monitored with sensors by the United States Geological Survey.  Geography  alt=Map of Oregon indicating Portland with a circle in the northwest, and major volcanoes indicated as triangles. Newberry is near the center of the state, under Three Sisters and above Crater Lake (Mount Mazama) The center of Newberry Volcano lies to the south of the city of Bend, at the intersection of Deschutes, Klamath and Lake counties in Oregon, where it is one of the most accessible volcanoes in the state. It is the largest volcano in the Cascade Volcanic Arc, and has roughly the same area as the state of Rhode Island at if its lava flows are included. Newberry lies east of the major crest of the Cascade Range in the High Lava Plains region, rising above its surroundings. From north to south, the volcano runs for a length of , with a width of and a total volume of about . Because of its enormous size and topographic prominence, it is often confused for an entire mountain range. Newberry Volcano has an extremely dry climate due to its location in the rain shadow of the Cascade Range. Climate data for the Newberry National Volcanic Monument are collected at the Lava Butte cinder cone, which had an average annual precipitation of from 2002 to 2012. Summer temperatures average from , dipping to average minimum and maximum temperatures of during the winter season. Spring has average temperatures of , while fall temperatures average . Each year, total precipitation consisting of winter snow and summer rain varies from in the highest parts of the region, and surface runoff rarely occurs even during heavy rain showers. Only one stream appears on Newberry's entire surface, and it remains unclear whether the volcano has ever been able to support glaciers on its slopes, since the mountain lacks cirques (amphitheater-like valleys formed by glacial erosion) or evidence of contact between lava and ice. However, displaced glacial erratics have been found far from their native areas, moraine sediment has been deposited on the eastern and northeastern slopes of the volcano, and the mountain's various cone features have \\"boat\\" shapes that indicate glacial alteration. The precise history of glaciers on the volcano is debated, but dry channels and dry waterfalls on the eastern and western slopes are evidence that the volcano once held water. The volcano has two crater lakes, Paulina Lake and East Lake, which are filled by precipitation and percolation of ground water. Paulina Lake occupies an area of and reaches a maximum depth of , and it is separated from East Lake by a narrow isthmus (a piece of land connecting two larger areas across an expanse of water by which they are otherwise separated), which is composed of rhyolite lava. East Lake has a smaller area of with a maximum depth of . The lakes have historically flooded channels surrounding the volcano. A large flood between 4,000 and 2,300 years ago released up to 12,000 acre feet (0.0148 km3) in volume from Paulina Lake, filling the valley floor above the Paulina Prairie, which surrounds the lake. It was possibly caused by the failure of a rock ledge in height, rather than eruptive activity. Another flood took place in 1909 on the Deschutes River downstream from where it meets its tributary the Little Deschutes River.  Ecology  The Newberry National Volcanic Monument forms part of the northern section of the Mazama Ecological Province, which has soil comprised by aeolian pumice and volcanic products over basalt bedrock. Flora within the Newberry Volcano area includes forests of juniper, whitebark pine, ponderosa pine (including Oregon's largest ponderosa pine tree), lodgepole pine, jack pine, and white fir, in addition to other plants like Indian paintbrush, purple penstemon, bitterbrush, manzanita, and snowbrush. Infestations by mountain pine beetles have killed many lodgepole pines in the area. Animals near Newberry Volcano include burrowing owls, kangaroo rats, lizards, bats, rattlesnakes, eagles, porcupines, otters, bobcats, mule deer, Roosevelt elk, ducks, and American pika. Lava flows from Newberry display varied vegetation cover, and there are variable levels of flora between flows, though the level of vegetation and species diversity generally increase with elevation. Dominant plant species on lava flows include oceanspray and wax currant, with rabbitbrush also common. Though forbs are not widespread on the lava flows, where they do occur Davidson's penstemon and hotrock penstemon dominate. Above elevations of , roundleaf alumroot is common, particularly near the edges of lava flows. All lava flows support patches of grasses such as Idaho fescue, especially on north-facing slopes. One lava flow at Lava Butte is barren except for scattered, dense patches of greenleaf manzanita. The Lava Cast Forest is a group of trees molded by lava from an eruption 6,000 years ago. Today, the surrounding site lies within the Newberry National Volcanic Monument and includes 11 kƒ´pukas, plots of land surrounded by one or more younger lava flows. These habitat islands range from in area and sustain forests that have not been significantly altered by humans other than nearby fire suppression and land management efforts. Consisting of pure and mixed forest stands, these forests include ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine, and grand fir/white fir hybrid trees, which are supported by young soils derived from Mazama pumice.  Geology  Progression of ages of rhyolitic (silicic) lavas and calderas from alt=The diagram displays the movement of the North American tectonic plate with an arrow moving from right to left, with ovular shapes indicating the age progression of centers of rhyolitic (silicic) lavas. From right to left, three major volcanic centers are indicated with concentric circles, Yellowstone Caldera to McDermitt Caldera to Newberry Caldera Overlapping with the northwestern corner of the Basin and Range Province, also known as the High Lava Plains, Newberry Volcano lies within a Cenozoic highland marked by normal faults known as the Brothers Fault Zone. It is situated at the intersection of the Brothers Fault Zone with the north‚Äìnorthwest-trending Sisters and northeast-trending Walker Rim fault zones. In the mantle under Newberry Volcano, P and S seismic waves exhibit an unusually low wave velocity. The Earth's crust thins from at the nearby Three Sisters volcano complex to near Newberry, where it has a high Poisson's ratio. The oldest rocks in this region include silicic (rich in silica) lava domes from the late Miocene or early Pliocene, which lie near the province's eastern and southern borders, respectively. Volcanism in this area suggests a progression of silicic eruptions, known as the Newberry Trend, that moves in a northwest-trending direction from the Harney Basin to Newberry Volcano and the rest of the Cascade Range. Newberry Volcano's origins are somewhat controversial; some scientists think it originated from an independent hotspot, but overwhelming evidence suggests that it is part of the Cascades Arc and was produced by the subduction of the oceanic Juan de Fuca and Gorda tectonic plates under the continental North American Plate. However, Newberry Volcano has been transformed by tectonic processes, possibly related to subductive mechanisms that enhance melting of the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate. The High Lava Plains Trend, or the Newberry Trend, moves at an oblique angle to the underlying North American tectonic plate, for which subduction counterflow, gravitational flow along the lithosphere's base, faulting, and extension of the Basin and Range Province have all been proposed as possible mechanisms. At Newberry, the subducting plate has a depth that is shallower than elsewhere in the major crest of the Cascades, accounting for its unique magmas. Newberry Volcano is likely fed by a magma chamber under the large, cauldron-like caldera at its summit. This caldera has dimensions of and formed about 75,000 years ago. Newberry Volcano first formed about 600,000 years ago and has since been built up by several thousand eruptions. About 500,000 years ago, Mount Newberry attained an elevation of . The caldera-forming event occurred about 75,000 years ago from a major explosive eruption. It formed the crater lakes and Paulina Peak‚Äîwhich is the highest point on the volcano, at . As a result of its caldera-forming eruption, Newberry has a horizontal profile, which is typical of a shield volcano. However, it is also considered a composite volcano, made up of a matrix of lava flows and pyroclastic deposits. Unlike more typical composite volcanoes in the Cascades, it formed from several eruption types including more traditional explosive eruptions and more fluid effusive events; thus it is usually classified as a \\"shield-shaped composite volcano\\", or shield-shaped stratovolcano. The volcano has a caldera at its summit, which has a diameter of and features two crater lakes: Paulina Lake and East Lake. This caldera, known as the Newberry Crater, is forested, with small parts of its surface covered with lava flows and pumice deposits. Before the caldera's creation, the mountain's summit was greater in height than its current elevation. The caldera has reformed several times throughout the volcano's history, burying the caldera floor to a depth of and creating concentric calderas, each smaller than its predecessor. The first caldera‚Äîthe volcano's largest caldera, forming approximately 300,000 years ago‚Äîwas produced by the eruption of of pyroclastic ejecta, which created the Tepee Draw tuff and ash deposits that cover the volcano's eastern flank. The last crater formed after an explosive eruption about 80,000 years ago, which ejected up to of pyroclastic materials. Throughout this progression, the volcano shifted from rhyodacitic pumice to basaltic ash flows, the latter producing the Black Lapilli tuff that covers the western side of the volcano. Since the last caldera-forming eruption 80,000 years ago, the volcano has undergone silicic eruptions at the caldera and produced basaltic and basaltic andesite lava flows that extended down its outer flanks. The tephra and ash from the Black Lapilli tuff by the caldera formed agglutinates around its rim. Newberry Volcano is cut by several fault scarps, small step offsets on the ground surface where one side of a fault has moved vertically with respect to the other. At the center of the isthmus that separates Newberry Volcano's two crater lakes is the central volcanic cone, named Central Pumice cone, which reaches above East Lake. With a broad, flat top, it formed during an explosive eruption about 7,000 years ago, and sits in the center of the caldera. Compositionally, lava from the Newberry Volcano has varied from primitive basalts with high magnesium levels to more evolved tholeiitic and calc- alkaline deposits (based on the major element characteristics of the lavas). Primitive lavas exhibit high abundances of chromium and nickel as well as variable concentrations of fluid-mobile elements like barium and strontium. Tholeiitic and calc-alkaline lavas display overlap in magnesium, calcium oxide, and aluminum oxide levels but differ in that the tholeiites have lower contents of silica and potassium oxide and higher iron(II) oxide, titanium dioxide, and sodium oxide. There is also much overlap in isotopic composition, though the tholeiitic lavas mark the low point for 87Sr/86Sr and the high point for 143Nd/144Nd and 176Hf/177Hf. Examination of Newberry lavas with olivine-plagioclase hygrometry shows that tholeiites are anhydrous (less than ) and thus distinct from calc-alkaline deposits ); both have different fractional crystallization sequences that derive from primitive magmas, which had their compositions influenced by equilibrium with peridotite in the mantle. By volume, basaltic andesite is the principal lava type at Newberry Volcano, with large volumes of silicic lava among older ash flow tuff deposits. = Subfeatures = alt=The conical volcano Lava Butte and its central crater are seen from above, with the volcano's right half forested while the opposite side is largely barren. An access road flanks the cone. Vents at the volcano follow north-east and north-west trends influenced by extension of the Basin and Range Province. With more than 400 vents, Newberry has more individual subfeatures than any other volcano in the contiguous United States. These include cinder cones, lava domes, and various other lava edifices, with at least 25 vents on the volcano's flanks and summits becoming active within the past 10,000 years. Most of the cinder cones on the volcano's edifice vary from in elevation, though a number of them reach heights above with diameters greater than . Most of these exhibit saucer-like summit depression landforms, with notable exceptions at Lava Top and North Kawak Buttes, which have craters that are in depth. Basaltic and basaltic andesite lava flows have penetrated the bases of many of these cinder cones, forming a matrix of connected flows, and a veneer of pƒÅhoehoe and  ªa ªƒÅ lavas can be found on Newberry volcano's northern and southern sides. The northern flank holds three distinct lava tube systems that formed out of pƒÅhoehoe lava: the Horse Lava Tube System (also known as the Horse System), Arnold Lava Tube System, and the Lava Top Butte basalt. About 7,000 years ago, at Newberry's Northwest Rift Zone, lava fountains erupted from a fissure with a length of , yielding basaltic and andesitic lava flows. Strombolian eruptions (which eject incandescent cinder, lapilli, and lava bombs) produced tephra that formed Lava Butte, a cinder cone near Newberry with a height of , a base diameter of , and a crater depth of . With a lopsided shape where the northeastern rim is taller than the southwestern counterpart, this cinder cone sits south of Bend. The nearby Badlands shield volcano, which formed out of a rootless vent to produce a large basaltic lava flow at Newberry, has a diameter of . It has pƒÅhoehoe lava throughout its surface, with tumuli (mounds of earth and stones) and a pit crater. Dacite and rhyodacite domes can be found on the middle and upper flanks, and Newberry also features twenty rhyolitic lava domes and lava flows among its western, eastern, and southern flanks. These include East Butte and China Hat at the eastern base of the volcano, which date to 850,000 and 780,000 years ago, and therefore predate Newberry. The McKay Butte, found on the volcano's western side, formed 580,000 years ago. Other Holocene eruptions have produced rhyolite lava that remained closed to the summit, including Paulina Peak, which has a width of one mile and reaches within of the wall of the caldera. Hot springs can be found at Paulina Lake and East Lake, along with one fumarole gas vent at Lost Lake, located near the Big Obsidian lava flow. These discharge gases like water vapor and carbon dioxide and give off a rotten smell, though the composition has few noxious components.  Eruptive history  alt=A map shows the extent of lava flows emanating from Newberry Volcano under the extent of the volcanic center itself During the late Pleistocene, Newberry Volcano produced a number of voluminous lava flows, made of basalt, which originated from several vents on its northern flank and reached the modern areas of Bend and Redmond. They filled canyons that served as precursors for the Deschutes and Crooked rivers‚Äìsince eroded‚Äìand extended tens of miles from the volcano. Lava from the last of these eruptions about 78,000 years ago covered the Bend area, surrounded the Pilot Butte cinder cone, and filled the Deschutes River bed. In addition to its production of large lava flows, Newberry Volcano has also produced a number of Plinian eruptions similar to the eruption of Vesuvius that destroyed Pompeii and Pel√©an eruptions like the 1902 explosion of Mount Pel√©e. These include a number of caldera-forming eruptions, producing ash flow deposits including the Tepee Draw tuff and Black Lapilli tuff, and rising or more into the stratosphere. The last of these eruptions covered tens of thousands of square miles with ash, extending to the San Francisco Bay Area in California nearly to the southwest. Here, it reaches a thickness of one centimeter. Additionally, Newberry has produced multiple, voluminous explosive eruptions, with certain studies estimating up to 60 eruptive events of rhyolite and dacite tephra that reach Idaho, Utah, and northern California. These include the eruption that produced the Paulina Creek tephra between 55,000 and 50,000 years ago, and the eruption from 20,000 years ago responsible for the Wono tephra, which extends into western Nevada and east-central California. As a result of compositional zoning within the magma chamber that feeds the volcano, its ash deposits may show different chemical and mineralogical makeups. The last of these tephra eruptions yielded the Newberry pumice just before 1,300 years ago, reaching several hundred miles to the east. Between the last Ice Age about 12,000 years ago and 7,700 years ago, the volcano erupted at least 12 times. Mount Mazama erupted 7,700 years ago, producing volcanic ash and pumice that accumulated to a thickness of up to on the Newberry Volcano, covering many of the lava flows on its slopes. During three eruptive periods at Newberry over the past 7,500 years, the caldera has seen rhyolitic eruptions from seven individual vents. About 7,000 years ago, eruptions occurred along the rift zone northwest of Newberry Volcano's caldera, yielding 12 lava flows that encompassed an area of . At about the same time, the Central Pumice cone was produced by eruptions that also formed the Interlake and Game Hut obsidian flows from a vent on the cone's southern flank. An eruption from a fissure zone at East Lake, 3,500 years ago, yielded tephra and formed the East Lake obsidian lava flows. The volcano underwent its most recent eruptions 1,300 years ago, producing the Big Obsidian flow. A silicic deposit, it is made up of rhyolite and features a number of lava blocks. Although it is frequently cited as the largest Holocene obsidian formation in the United States, its area of and volume of actually place it fifth in the nation. The eruptions, which were both explosive and effusive, began with a Plinian explosion of pumice and tephra that covered the caldera's eastern half and reached several hundred miles to the east. This deposit, called the Newberry pumice, reaches a thickness of up to from the vent that produced it, which is located at the southern flank of the caldera, and a thickness of up to from the volcano. Because of strong westerly winds, tephra reached as far east as Idaho. This eruption also produced pyroclastic flows that left volcanic bombs in Paulina Lake. = Recent activity and current threats = Though Newberry Volcano is currently quiet, the United States Geological Survey considers it an active volcano with a \\"very high\\" threat level. Hot springs within the caldera remain active, and small earthquakes have occurred within recent local history. Any future eruptions would likely show similar characteristics to eruptions from the past 15,000 years, ranging from effusive production of lava flows to explosive eruptions ejecting pumice and ash. If future lava flows from Newberry Volcano are of comparable size to its late Pleistocene eruptions, they would bury settlements throughout the Central Oregon region. They would also likely destroy segments of U.S. Route 97, disabling transportation in the area, in addition to likely ruining gas pipelines and power lines that extend electricity to California, both of which would be accompanied by serious economic consequences. Flank lava flows, which would likely be basaltic in origin, might form lava fountains that could scatter cinders and lava for several thousand meters, building cinder cones or initiating forest fires. While the flows themselves move at rates of per minute, and thus could be escaped by animals and humans, they would destroy stationary structures in their paths. Pyroclastic flows, on the other hand, travel at speeds of , and their violent force could incinerate or pulverize objects in their path, or asphyxiate living things. If another caldera-forming eruption of similar magnitude to previous ones at the volcano occurred, pyroclastic flows could devastate the area surrounding the volcano for up to . However, pyroclastic flows have been rare at Newberry. Tephra from explosive eruptions would short-circuit electric transformers and power lines, clog engine filters, produce clouds that might yield lightning, and pose a hazard to aircraft overhead. It would also pose health hazards because ash particles can irritate eyes, and when ingested, lungs, among other health issues. Because of water from the two crater lakes, eruptions at Newberry Volcano may become more explosive and more likely to produce pyroclastic flows. Moreover, if pyroclastic flows mix with snow or water overflowing from the crater lakes, they could spawn lahars, volcanically induced mudslides, landslides, and debris flows that could devastate the Paulina Creek valley and reach the La Pine valley within 30 minutes. Threats from the volcano pose hazards to about 16,400 people who live within and more than 180,000 people living within . In addition to threats from volcanic activity, at least one flood has taken place at Newberry Volcano in the past, though it may not have been a result of eruptive activity. If lava flows from an eruption blocked the Deschutes River, they might generate floods upstream by increasing water level and downstream once the blockage clears. Earthquakes unrelated to volcanic activity also take place in Oregon, though they are usually less than 2.5 on the Richter magnitude scale. Volcanoes can also cause earthquakes reaching magnitudes up to 5 on the Richter scale, which sometimes occur as swarms. These clusters of tremors cause shaking of houses, walls, and windows and can crack plaster or walls in older buildings but rarely cause major damage. Powerful earthquakes close to magnitude 7 would cause damage independently, but they would not cause Newberry Volcano to erupt unless it were already on the verge of activity. Additional threats exist for rockfalls and avalanches. If Newberry Volcano were to erupt, it should be possible to detect increased seismic activity, while increased production of volcanic gas would likely kill trees near the volcano, which scientists would quickly recognize before notifying emergency management agencies. Before 2011, Newberry was monitored by just one seismic station that had been installed in 1987 and had only detected seven earthquakes within of the volcano. In 2011, scientists from the Cascades Volcano Observatory installed eight more seismic and deformation monitors in the volcano's vicinity, which has seen the number of detectable earthquakes rise to 10‚Äì15 per year. The volcano continues to be closely monitored by the United States Geological Survey, which monitors a seismometer network with the geophysics program at the University of Washington and regularly conducts leveling surveys to check for geological deformation that could suggest impending activity, in addition to sampling geothermal areas. There are GPS instruments installed within the volcano's vicinity to monitor any swelling that occurs as a result of underground movement of magma. Despite historical uplift at the volcano, deformation has remained continuously low in recent years.  Human history  alt=Black-and-white portrait of John Strong Newberry, the volcano's namesake The area around Newberry Volcano has been inhabited by Native American peoples for more than 10,000 years, though only intermittently as a result of eruptive activity at the volcano and in the surrounding area. During an archaeological excavation near Paulina Lake in 1992, researchers discovered remnants of a central hearth and a housing structure with support posts and linear rock arrangements with dimensions of . Radiocarbon dating of charcoal samples from the site were dated to 11,000 years ago. The mountain's caldera was used to harvest obsidian, which they used to sharpen arrowheads and tools and traded throughout the Pacific Coast region for several thousand years. The first recorded European to visit the volcano was Peter Skene Ogden, a trapper who reached the crater in 1826. In 1855, the volcano's namesake, John Strong Newberry, a surgeon and geologist for the Williamson and Abbot survey party, visited central Oregon while mapping the local area for the Pacific Railroad, but never visited the volcano. Paulina Lake, Paulina Creek, and Paulina Peak are named after Paulina, a Snake Indian chief who headed raiding parties against whites during the 1850s and 1860s before he was pursued and shot by settler Howard Maupin. Near the end of the 19th century, the Lava River Cave was used by the hunter Leander Dillman to store perishable foods. The name Mount Newberry was proposed by Israel Russell, who visited the area in 1903, though the name did not come into use. Instead, it was known as Newberry Crater until it was renamed to the Newberry Volcano in the 1930s by geologist Howel Williams, a name which was formally accepted in 2003 when geologist Larry Chitwood supported it through the official geographic naming process. Because of the efforts of Hollis Dole, head of the Oregon Department of Geology, to promote the area, in 1963 NASA scientists became interested in using lava fields at Newberry to prepare for the United States' first moon landing. NASA used the area in October 1964 and July 1966 to geologically train the Apollo Astronauts in recognizing volcanic features, such as cinder and pumice cones, lava flows, ash and obsidian flows, and a lava tube. Astronauts who would use this training on the Moon included Apollo 11's Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, Apollo 12's Alan Bean, Apollo 14's Edgar Mitchell, Apollo 15's James Irwin, and Apollo 16's Charlie Duke. Notable geologist instructors included Aaron Waters. The Newberry National Volcanic Monument was established in November 1990 by the United States Congress. With an area of more than , it forms a near-circular shape around the summit caldera and then a long corridor from the mountain's northwestern side to the Deschutes River that includes a rift zone. The Monument lies within the Deschutes National Forest, which is managed by the United States Forest Service. As of 1997, the caldera area of Newberry holds seven campgrounds, two resort areas, and six summer houses. = Mining and geothermal energy = Because Newberry has had recent eruptive activity, has remained active for a long time, and has a shallow heat source feeding hot springs, it represents a source of geothermal energy. An investigation conducted by the United States Geological Survey in 1981 drilled a well in depth at a location to the east of the Big Obsidian flow, finding temperatures of under the surface there. An energy company drilled two holes with a depth of in 1995 and 1996, but they were unable to find fluids, so they lacked a mechanism to drive turbines and opted to end the project at Newberry. According to many scientists, Newberry Volcano represents the best geothermal energy candidate in the Pacific Northwest; in 2012, a deep well was built to determine whether water directed into the hole might be heated and returned to the surface in order to yield energy.  Recreation  A hiker under the arched ceilings of a representative portion of alt=A hiker stands under the arched ceilings of the Lava River Cave, which was formed from a lava flow at Newberry Volcano Newberry Volcano is visited by 250,000 people each year, who come to go fishing for trout in East Lake, to camp on Paulina Lake, or go mountain biking around the loop that surrounds the crater. The lakes are also popular for boating. At the Newberry National Volcanic Monument, camping, fishing, and hiking are popular, including on the Trail of the Molten Land, which follows a 7,000-year-old lava flow from Lava Butte, and the Trail of the Whispering Pines, which traverses a ponderosa pine forest. Horse riding is also possible in a section of the Peter Skene Ogden Trail, long, which runs through the monument area; snowmobiling and cross-country skiing are also popular. The Lava Lands Visitor Center within the Monument has an exhibit on the area's geology and culture and offers a paved path that runs for . A shuttle leaves from the center every 20 minutes during the peak season from Memorial Day through Labor Day, costing $2 per traveler. The area can also be accessed by personal motorized vehicles during off season with a permit from the visitor center, and the center's parking area remains open year-round. The area offers eight campgrounds operated by the United States Forest Service. The last lava flow from Newberry during the Pleistocene formed the Lava River Cave, to the south of Bend. This feature is the state's longest continuous lava tube, which can be hiked for more than one mile to the north and west and has an arching ceiling with a thickness of . This trail represents the monument's most popular attraction and can be hiked between May and mid- September with a recreation day pass that costs $5. Jackets are recommended, as the temperature within the cave is usually . The Lava Cast Forest, a group of trees molded by lava from an eruption 6,000 years ago, covers an area of and can be observed from a paved, narrow, and steep one-mile trail. The area was designated as the Lava Cast Forest Geological Area in April 1942 by the United States Forest Service, which included of land in the region. Known to the American public since 1928, by the mid-1940s the Lava Cast Forest was visited by thousands of tourists each year. In the mid-1970s, the region had 150,000 tourist visitors annually, with the Lava Lands Visitors Center built by the Forest Service in September 1975. The trail to the volcano's summit at Paulina Peak lasts from Highway 97, with an easy paved road to the caldera and four rest stops, though it grows steep and twisty near the end. The winding trail near the end is made of gravel and lasts for three miles, offering views of Mount Hood, Mount McLoughlin, and the Three Sisters volcanoes.

The second highest mountain in Oregon, it is situated within Linn County, Jefferson County, and Marion County and forms part of the Mount Jefferson Wilderness. Due to the ruggedness of its surroundings, the mountain is one of the hardest volcanoes to reach in the Cascades. It is also a popular tourist destination despite its remoteness, with recreational activities including hiking, backpacking, mountaineering, and photography. Vegetation at Mount Jefferson is dominated by Douglas fir, silver fir, mountain hemlock, ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine, and several cedar species. Carnivores, insectivores, bats, rodents, deer, birds, and various other species inhabit the area. Also known as Seekseekqua by Native American populations, the volcano was named after United States President Thomas Jefferson, and was first ascended by E. C. Cross and R. L. Farmer in 1888. It sits atop an area of crustal melting, and was produced by the subduction of the oceanic Juan de Fuca tectonic plate under the continental North American tectonic plate, forming about 730,000 years ago. Consisting of basaltic andesite, andesite, and dacite, the mountain has been extensively altered by glacial erosion. The surrounding area contains a number of other volcanic features like cinder cones, shield volcanoes, and tuyas (flat-topped, steep-sided volcanoes formed when lava erupts through a thick glacier or ice sheet). It is considered a low threat by the United States Geological Survey. Despite the low chance of future eruptions, many scientists still consider mudflows a major threat at Mount Jefferson.  Geography  Jefferson's location in Oregon relative to other major volcanoes The second tallest mountain in the U.S. state of Oregon after Mount Hood, Mount Jefferson lies within Jefferson, Linn, and Marion counties, in the central part of the state. Reaching an elevation of , the volcano has a proximal relief of . It is not usually visible from the city of Portland, though it is visible on clear days from Salem and can be noticed from highways to both the east and the west of the Cascade Range. The average elevation of the terrain around Jefferson is , meaning that Jefferson's cone rises nearly above its surroundings. = Wilderness = Mount Jefferson's eastern segment lies within the Warm Springs Indian Reservation, and its western portion within the Mount Jefferson Wilderness, of the Willamette National Forest and Deschutes National Forests. The wilderness area covers , with more than 150 lakes. It also has of trails, including of the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail. Mount Jefferson is the major feature of the wilderness, along with the nearby Three Fingered Jack volcano. = Physical geography = Mount Jefferson lies in the temperate maritime climate of Western Oregon. The Cascades absorb east-moving moisture, causing warm and dry summers. Winters show higher precipitation levels, especially at higher elevations, averaging at peak altitudes and consisting mostly of snow. Moving east, annual precipitation levels decrease from to lower than . A view of Mount Jefferson from Russell Lake in 1934 When Little Ice Age glaciers retreated during the 20th century, water filled in the spaces left behind, forming moraine-dammed lakes, which are more common in the Mount Jefferson Wilderness and the nearby Three Sisters Wilderness than anywhere else in the contiguous United States. A number of these lakes breached during the 20th century and inundated Jefferson Park and the Jefferson Creek drainage under Waldo Glacier. These breach events yielded floods and small lahars (volcanically induced mudslides, landslides, and debris flows). The flood on August 21, 1934, at a lake formed near Whitewater Glacier, created a debris flow that reached the Whitewater River drainage and buried parts of Jefferson Park in of debris; another event took place in 1957, but was poorly documented. Mount Jefferson has 35 snow and ice features, including four named glaciers: Whitewater, Jefferson Park, Russell, and Waldo. These features, for the most part on the northern, eastern, and southeastern parts of Mount Jefferson, span elevations from and cover an area of . The volcano, like much of the Oregon Cascades, was likely covered by an ice cap during the Pleistocene, with the glaciers at their peak size between 25,000 and 20,000 years ago. In recent years, the glaciers have retreated to form lateral moraines; Whitewater Glacier, for example, shrunk from in width and in length to in width and a length of . During the 20th century, scientists thought they had identified a new glacier, which they named Milk Creek Glacier, but later studies established that it was an artifact of stagnant ice that had been hidden by debris, and it is no longer considered its own distinct feature. Other geographic features at Jefferson include rock outcrops, steep talus slopes, conifer forests, and alpine meadows. Additionally, a number of rivers drain Mount Jefferson. The northern and northwestern slopes feed the South Fork Breitenbush River, which flows into Detroit Lake, and the eastern side of Detroit Lake also receives water from Whitewater Creek, Russell Creek, and Milk Creek, which flow from the western flank of Mount Jefferson. The Whitewater Glacier and the northeastern side of the volcano drain into the Whitewater River, and Shitike Creek flows between Mount Jefferson and Olallie Butte before reaching the Deschutes River. Both Jefferson and Parker Creeks receive water from Jefferson's southeastern slopes, then join the Metolius River. Wildfires occur within the wilderness area at Mount Jefferson. In the late summer to early fall of 2017, the Whitewater and Little Devil fires occurred. While the Little Devil fire covered , the Whitewater fire reached more than in area, provoking the use of amphibious aircraft and causing trail closures. As a result of the Whitewater fire, officials closed the Mount Jefferson Wilderness during the solar eclipse of August 21, 2017.  Ecology  A coniferous forest near Mount Jefferson (Jefferson visible in the background) Vegetation at Mount Jefferson is dominated by Douglas-fir, silver fir, mountain hemlock, ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine, and several species of cedar. Vine maple, rhododendron, purple lupine, yellow lupine, Indian paintbrush, wild strawberries, and red huckleberries are also common around Mount Jefferson. Above the timber line at above sea level, mountain hemlock and whitebark pine predominate, though mountain hemlock has also invaded into subalpine meadows at Mount Jefferson, possibly as a result of fire control programs, grazing, the influence of adjacent forest areas, and climate change. Carnivorous animals at Mount Jefferson and its surroundings include American black bears, coyotes, cougars, red foxes, raccoons, American martens, stoats (also known as ermines), long-tailed weasels, American minks, North American river otters, and bobcats. Deer species include Roosevelt elk, black-tailed deer, and mule deer; insectivores include vagrant shrews, American water shrews, and coast moles. Bats at Jefferson include little brown bats and silver-haired bats, and American pikas and snowshoe hares are also present. Rodents such as yellow-bellied marmots, mountain beavers, yellow-pine chipmunks, Townsend's chipmunks, golden-mantled ground squirrels, western gray squirrels, Douglas squirrels, mountain pocket gophers, North American beavers, deer mice, bushy-tailed woodrats, water voles, Pacific jumping mice, and North American porcupines are present. Birds at Jefferson include mallards, northern goshawks, sharp-shinned hawks, red-tailed hawks, dusky grouses, grey partridges, killdeers, spotted sandpipers, California gulls, band-tailed pigeons, great horned owls, mountain pygmy owls, common nighthawks, rufous hummingbirds, Northern flickers, pileated woodpeckers, yellow-bellied sapsuckers, hairy woodpeckers, and white-headed woodpeckers. Other bird species found in the area consist of Eurasian three-toed woodpeckers, willow flycatchers, olive-sided flycatchers, tree swallows, Canada jays, Steller's jays, common ravens, Clark's nutcrackers, black-capped chickadees, mountain chickadees, chestnut-backed chickadees, red-breasted nuthatches, pygmy nuthatches, Eurasian treecreepers, American dippers, wrens, American robins, varied thrushes, hermit thrushes, Townsend's solitaires, golden-crowned kinglets, ruby-crowned kinglets, water pipits, blue-headed vireos, western tanagers, Cassin's finches, gray-crowned rosy finches, pine siskins, red crossbills, green-tailed towhees, dark-eyed juncos, white-crowned sparrows, golden-crowned sparrows, fox sparrows, and Lincoln's sparrows. Long-toed salamanders, California giant salamanders, rough-skinned newts, tailed frogs, western toads, Pacific tree frogs, northern red-legged frogs, Oregon spotted frogs, pygmy short-horned lizards, common garter snakes, and northwestern garter snakes make up some of the amphibious and reptilian animals in the vicinity. Roughly half the lakes in the Jefferson area contain rainbow trout.  Geology  Mount Jefferson Mount Jefferson shows normal magnetic polarity, suggesting that it formed less than 730,000 years ago. Created by the subduction of the oceanic Juan de Fuca tectonic plate under the continental North American tectonic plate in an area where the Earth's crust is thick, it is part of the Oregon High Cascades, which are influenced by the movement of the North American Plate and the extension of its continental crust. These extensional processes formed grabens, or valley-like depressions between parallel fault lines, at the eastern boundary of the central Cascades, including a deep formation. Jefferson does not lie in one of these grabens, but these tectonic processes continue, albeit at a less dramatic rate. At their peak rates, the crustal extension and depression of the Cascades area caused eruption of the Minto Lavas, made of basalt, followed by the Santiam basalts, named for their movement into the North Santiam River valley, which they filled to depths of . Though the Jefferson vicinity has produced andesitic and dacitic lavas for the past 5 to 6 million years, major volcanoes more than south of the area have erupted basaltic andesite. The central Oregon Cascades are made up of Eocene to Quaternary volcanic, volcaniclastic, igneous, and sedimentary rock. Miocene and Pliocene volcanic and sedimentary rocks have been exposed in the Jefferson area, which also sits above lava flows, cinder material, and breccia from the High Cascades that formed during and after the Pliocene. Jefferson is the largest volcano in the Jefferson Reach, which forms the strip that makes up the northern part of the Oregon Cascade Range. Stretching from Frog Lake Buttes to South Cinder Peak, this segment consists of at least 175 Quaternary volcanoes. With a width of , it differs from the adjacent northern segment of the Cascades, where volcanoes show a scattered distribution. Other unusual features of the Jefferson Reach include that the northernmost of the strip does not contain many volcanoes formed since the early Pleistocene and that it features a number of andesitic and dacitic volcanoes, which are unlike the many mafic (rich in magnesium and iron) shield volcanoes within the stretch. North of Pinhead Buttes, the volcanoes in this region are older and less tall, usually between in elevation. South of Pinhead Buttes, the Cascades becomes younger Pleistocene volcanoes, which often have glaciers. Mount Jefferson may form part of a long- lasting intracrustal melting and magma storage area that encompasses an area of , where relatively little mafic eruptive activity has occurred. The melting of the metamorphic rocks amphibolite and at deeper strata, granulite, have both produced intermediate and silicic lavas at Jefferson. The strip may still be active, as monogenetic vents near Jefferson have produced basaltic andesite since the last glacial period. Jefferson ‚Äî with Mount Hood, the Three Sisters- Broken Top area, and Crater Lake ‚Äî represents one of four volcanic centers responsible for much of the Oregon Cascades' Quaternary andesite, dacite, and rhyolite deposits. Some of this andesite and dacite occurs in vents that underlie the Jefferson vicinity, which also erupted during the Quaternary. Quaternary volcanic production rates in the Cascade Range from Jefferson to Crater Lake have averaged per mile of arc length per million years. In the area surrounding Mount Jefferson, monogenetic volcanoes constructed an upland area composed of basaltic lava flows and small volcanic vents. Within this region, basaltic vents occur at Olallie Butte, Potato Butte, Sisi Butte, North Cinder Peak, and South Cinder Peak, with basaltic lava flows at Cabot Creek, Jefferson Creek, and upper Puzzle Creek. There are several hundred other basaltic volcanoes within the central Oregon High Cascades, extending up to away. Mount Jefferson overlies an silicic volcanic field from the early Pleistocene. Between five and six million years old, the field reaches north from Jefferson to Olallie Butte, and it covers an area of . Scientists think that the setup of this field, where various vents have erupted lava, explains why the otherwise similar Cascades volcano at Mount Hood is three times as voluminous as Jefferson, because Hood has concentrated most of the eruptions from its magma chambers. The field is also likely underlain by a batholith, a large mass of intrusive igneous rock (also called a pluton) that forms from cooled magma deep in the Earth's crust. An aerial photo of the summit of Mt. Jefferson, October 2015 Mount Jefferson is a stratovolcano, made up of basaltic andesite, andesite, and dacite overlying basaltic shield volcanoes, with andesite and more silicic (rich in silica) rock forming the majority of the mountain. Rhyolite from the Quaternary can also be found at Jefferson, though it is not commonly found within the major volcanic centers of the Oregon Cascades. The volcano constitutes a small stratovolcano within the Cascades, with a current volume of , though prior to erosion and other alterations over time, it may have been as large as in volume at one time. Mount Jefferson has been significantly altered by erosion, and represents one of the most eroded stratovolcanoes in the state of Oregon. Glacial motion during the Pleistocene decreased the summit's elevation by a few hundred feet and formed a cirque (an amphitheatre-like valley carved by glacial erosion) on the western side of the volcano. This feature, known as the West Milk Creek cirque, includes the two Milk Creek glaciers and extends into the interior of Mount Jefferson, exposing tephra and pyroclastic rock in the main volcanic cone. The final two advances of glaciers during the Pleistocene removed about a third of the volcano's original volume, decreasing the overall elevation by . Currently, the Whitewater Glacier and the Milk Creek glaciers erode the mountain's eastern and western flanks, respectively, and are likely to gradually form a cleft between the northern and southern horns of the summit. Within Jefferson's main volcanic cone, more than 200 andesitic lava flows are now exposed, with mean thicknesses from , as well as an immense, pink dacitic lava flow with a thickness of . The volcano also possess a small volcanic plug (created when magma hardens within a vent on an active volcano), situated under the summit. Jefferson's main cone ranges from 58 to 64 percent silicon dioxide, and is mostly made up of andesite and dacite. The upper of Jefferson's cone formed within the past 100,000 years, and consists mostly of dacite lava flows and lava domes. While it is possible that glaciers shed material from the burgeoning lava domes, any evidence of these domes generating pyroclastic flows or lahars has not been preserved in the geological record. Basalt at Mount Jefferson contains olivine, clinopyroxene, and plagioclase phenocryst crystals, while basaltic andesite phenocrysts include plagioclase (variable among samples), clinopyroxene, olivine, orthopyroxene, and occasionally, magnetite. Dacite and rhyodacite samples show amphibole, plagioclase, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, magnetite, apatite, and every so often ilmenite. Andesite shows similar composition to dacite samples, though sodic plagioclases and amphiboles are not as common. = Subfeatures = Volcanic activity in the vicinity of Mount Jefferson tends to originate from either stratovolcanoes that erupt for thousands of years or monogenetic volcanoes, which only erupt for brief periods of time. At least 35 volcanic vents can be detected within of the main volcanic cone at Mount Jefferson. These have produced andesitic and dacitic lava flows, lava domes, small shield volcanoes, and lava aprons. Basalt lava flows, at least two of which are younger than 7,700 years old, have been produced from four monogenetic volcanoes to the south of Jefferson, and they are not directly related to activity at the Mount Jefferson volcano. Rhyodacitic lava flows and pyroclastic material, which have since been significantly altered and stripped by glaciation, originated from eight vents in the area. The Mount Jefferson vicinity contains at least 40 of the 190 documented lava domes in the Oregon Cascades, including the tall Goat's Peak dome; it also contains monogenetic tuyas (flat-topped, steep-sided volcanoes formed when lava erupts through a thick glacier or ice sheet) and emplacements of hyaloclastite among mafic lava flows. The area is full of cinder cone volcanoes and intrusive lava plugs, which occur in irregular patterns. Made up of red to gray cinders, some are loose and agglutinated, and some contain intrusive rock plugs, while others do not. Cinder cones south of Mount Jefferson erupted lava flows, such as Forked Butte and North Cinder Peak. About 1,000 years ago, the South Cinder Peak cinder cone erupted, generating a lava flow that reached Marion Lake. Other volcanic cones associated with Mount Jefferson include Forked Butte and Horseshoe Cone.  Eruptive history  Mount Jefferson from above Scientists lack a comprehensive record of activity at Mount Jefferson, as important details have been obscured by the erosion of deposits by large glaciers. A few eruptions have been documented from the deposits that have been preserved, but the broad outline of Jefferson's eruptive history is understood, including that its activity has changed over time, producing both powerful explosive eruptions and lava flows. Historically, eruptive activity has alternated between andesitic and dacitic lavas. The volcano formed over the course of several eruptive episodes, beginning about 300,000 years ago with the formation of rocks on the western and southwestern flanks of the volcano, and lasting until roughly 15,000 years ago. The two major eruptive episodes were separated by glacial erosion of the volcano. At least during the past 700,000 years, eruptions at the volcano have produced andesitic and dacitic lava. Most of the volcano formed within the past 100,000 years, with the latest activity building the central volcanic cone taking place between 30,000 and 20,000 years ago. These eruptions took place amidst the last glacial period and indicate interaction of lava with ice. They erupted dacite lava flows and silicic lava domes from vents east of the former central cone, and were influenced by ice on Mount Jefferson, which prevented them from diffusing across the volcano's flanks. Instead, they formed lava tongues near the crater and coursed down spaces in between glaciers, creating volcanic glass and columnar joints, or arrays of prismatic shapes. Silicic lava domes from this eruptive episode collapsed over and over again, producing block-and-ash flows, or pyroclastic flows with many volcanic blocks among ash with a similar composition. About 150,000 years ago, an eruption produced the volcanic rock in the Park Butte area. A huge explosive eruption took place between 100,000 and 35,000 years ago (scientists have been unable to create a more specific time frame for the event), producing ash layers that covered the Metolius and Deschutes River valleys and eventually extended to the city of Arco, in the southeastern part of the state of Idaho. This eruption may have excavated the existing crater, but if that were the case, eruptions have since refilled the area and obscured evidence of a crater-forming event. Eruptions around the same time period yielded pyroclastic flows that coursed down the Whitewater River drainage of the eastern side of Mount Jefferson, and the Whitewater Creek on the volcano's western flank. Basaltic lava flows at Forked Butte and to the south of Bear Butte mark the newest lava flows in the Jefferson area, as both were produced after Mount Mazama erupted roughly 7,600 years ago. The last eruption occurred about a thousand years ago at a cinder cone on the flank of the South Cinder Peak cone. = Recent activity and potential hazards = The basaltic lava flows produced from four monogenetic vents near Mount Jefferson indicate that the local region could produce future eruptions and could be considered active. Mount Jefferson itself is listed with a \\"Low/Very Low\\" threat potential by the United States Geological Survey, but the agency has noted that \\"it may be too soon to regard Mount Jefferson as extinct.\\" In a 1987 report, Richard P. Hoblitt and other USGS scientists estimated that the yearly likelihood for a major explosive eruption at Jefferson does not exceed 1 in 100,000. However, given the incomplete geologic record, imprecise dating of its known deposits, and its lack of relatively recent activity, scientists from the United States Geological Survey have commented that \\"It is almost impossible to estimate the probability of future eruptions at Mount Jefferson.\\" They have designated proximal and distal hazard zones for the volcano, which extend and several tens of miles, respectively. An eruption from the volcano would threaten the immediate surrounding area, in addition to places downstream near river valleys or downwind that could be affected by ashfall. Lahars (volcanically induced mudslides, landslides, and debris flows) and tephra could extend far from the volcano, and Mount Jefferson may also produce pyroclastic flows, lava domes, and lava flows. Though the population within is only about 800 people, there are more than 550,000 people living with of the volcano. Lava flows from Mount Jefferson or another volcano nearby might form lava domes that could collapse, also yielding pyroclastic flows. Moreover, while basaltic lava flows from surrounding monogenetic vents tend to travel slowly and typically only reach from their source, and therefore would not pose serious hazards to much wildlife or humans, they would still burn and bury anything they encountered. Mazama Ash in the region reached in thickness, and at least one explosive eruption from Jefferson deposited of ash onto its surroundings within . Finer ash particles from the volcano could threaten air traffic, as a large gas plume may form; clouds from such a plume might also spawn pyroclastic flows on the flanks of the Jefferson volcano. Moreover, ash can cause irritation of the eyes or respiratory system among the ill, the elderly, and infants, potentially leading to chronic lung disease. Tephra can also lead to the short-circuiting of electric transformers and power lines, collapse roofs, clog engine filters, damage car engines, and create clouds capable of producing lightning that can start fires. Even monogenetic volcanoes in the area could yield hazardous ashfall, reaching in thickness in areas within ; it is unlikely they would threaten areas outside the local Jefferson vicinity. An eruption at Jefferson could create lahars that would reach Detroit Lake on the western side of the volcano or Lake Billy Chinook on the eastern side, leading to increased lake water levels (or lake dam failure) and endangering life downstream. In addition to the hazards from eruptions at Mount Jefferson, other safety threats include debris avalanches and lahars, which could be caused without an eruption as a result of the failure of glacial moraine dams; this has happened in the past at Jefferson. Even a small or mid-sized landslide could create lahars that travel far from the volcano. Flooding at one of the many lakes on the flanks of Jefferson could spawn lahars in the future. Many scientists think mudflows represent the largest threat at Jefferson. Seismic activity at Mount Jefferson is monitored by a regional network of seismic meters operated by the United States Geological Survey at the University of Washington's Geophysics Department. No frequent signs of detectable earthquake have been seen within the past two decades, but if earthquakes increased, scientists are prepared to deploy additional seismometers and other tools to monitor volcanic gas emissions and ground deformation indicating movement of magma into the volcano.  Human history  Mount Jefferson was named after the third President of the United States, Thomas Jefferson (pictured; painted in 1800 by Rembrandt Peale) A Native American name for the mountain is Seekseekqua; its English name, Mount Jefferson (originally called Mount Vancouver by the British) was decided in honor of U.S. President Thomas Jefferson by the Lewis and Clark Expedition. The expedition, which was sponsored by President Jefferson, first saw the peak from the mouth of the Willamette River on March 30, 1806. Walter Eaton later described Mount Jefferson as \\"the most remote, the most inaccessible and alluring\\" mountain in Oregon, writing that Jefferson and Mount Hood \\"seem to hold mystic converse with one another over the canyons between.\\" Mount Jefferson's glaciers were named by Oregon Bureau of Mines scientist Ira A. Williams in 1915, with former professor of geology at the University of Oregon, Edwin T. Hodge, publishing a report on the volcano's glaciers and geology in 1925. His report focused on the sequence of volcanic rocks at Jefferson, in addition to its physiography and glaciology. Aerial photographic surveys of the glaciers at Jefferson were conducted by the Mazamas, a hiking club from Portland, during the 20th century. In 1937, Thayer analyzed Mount Jefferson's petrography and petrology from segments of the Western Cascades and High Cascades, which he separated into local units. He expanded on this research in a 1939 publication looking at Jefferson vicinity lava flows. Field work followed in summer during 1965, led by G. W. Walker, and a 1974 study of the volcano's glacial and volcanic history was carried out by Kenneth G. Sutton and other geologists. The first ascent of Mount Jefferson was probably accomplished by E. C Cross and Ray L. Farmer on 12 August 1888 by way of the south ridge. George J. Pearce, who accompanied Cross and Farmer on the expedition, wrote an account of the climb for the Oregonian newspaper on 22 August 1900. The first climber to reach the summit via the north face was S. S. Mohler in 1903.  Recreation  Mount Jefferson from the Mount Jefferson Wilderness area Mount Jefferson is remote, and can usually only be reached on foot or by horse. There are no paved roads within of the mountain, and it is relatively little-known compared to other features near the Willamette Valley. Still, the mountain and its surrounding wilderness are visited by so many hikers, backpackers, and climbers each year, especially during the summer, that they face threats to their ecological well-being. The Warm Springs Tribal Council does not permit access to the volcano's eastern side, so only the western flanks can be used by the public. The western side can be reached from the Oregon Route 22 highway. Jefferson Park, on the northern slope of the mountain, can be reached on foot by taking the Whitewater Trail and following the Pacific Crest Trail for . Located within the Mount Jefferson Wilderness, it represents a popular tourist destination for its views, lakes, and meadows, with activities including backpacking, climbing, and hiking during the summer, as well as nature photography. The area contains 26 campsites, which enforce a maximum group size of 12 people, and do not allow campfires. As a result of increased traffic to the area between 2012 and 2014, the Willamette National Forest administration enforced a campsite reservation system as of 2016, but stopped the practice in 2017 due to its failure to reduce human impact within the region. The Jefferson Lake Trail runs for round trip, with an elevation gain of . Parts of the Trail were destroyed by a fire in the wilderness area in 2003, but the surviving remnants of the trail reopened after maintenance work was completed. At Marion Lake, there are several trails, including a long route and a hike to Marion Mountain that lasts round-trip. These and other trails through the region offer views of the devastation of fires in the wilderness area in 2003 and 2006. The Whitewater Trail runs north through the wilderness area for before reaching a junction, with the right path moving to the Pacific Crest Trail. In the Maxwell trail area, hikes of all difficulty levels can be found, including the challenging Maxwell Butte Trail 3391, the round trip at Santiam Lake Trail 3491, and the slightly less demanding Duffy Lake Trail 3427. At the Pamelia Lake trail area, there are streams, lakes, and springs, as well as bathrooms, parking areas, and picnic tables. The Pamelia Limited Entry Area only allows 20 groups per day and limits their size to mitigate human impacts on the wilderness. Trails at Pamelia Lake include the Hunts Creek Trail 3440 and a segment of the Pacific Crest Trail, in addition to the Pamelia Lake Trail 3439, which rises before meeting the Hunts Creek Trail. The area is popular for backpacking, mountaineering, horseback riding, and day hiking. Other popular trails include the Firecamp Lakes Trail and Canyon Creek Meadows trails. In addition to the trails, some of the most popular areas around Mount Jefferson Wilderness include Eight Lakes Basin, Pamelia Lake, Jack Lake, Duffy Lake, Russell Lake, Santiam Lake and Wasco Lake. Mount Jefferson can be climbed, but the route is challenging, especially the pinnacle of the summit. Nearly annually, at least one climber attempting Jefferson perishes. Because of the hazards and difficulty of climbing Mount Jefferson, the U.S. National Geodetic Survey recommends that only experienced climbers try to climb it.

Over 190 species are recognized in this genus. This genus includes pathogens known to cause serious diseases in mammals, including tuberculosis (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) and leprosy (Mycobacterium leprae) in humans. The Greek prefix myco- means \\"fungus,\\" alluding to the way mycobacteria have been observed to grow in a mold-like fashion on the surface of cultures.James H. Kerr and Terry L. Barrett, \\"Atypical Mycobacterial Diseases\\", Military Dermatology Textbook, p. 401. It is acid fast and cannot be stained by the Gram stain procedure. Microbiologic characteristics =Metabolism and morphology= Mycobacterial cell wall: 1-outer lipids, 2-mycolic acid, 3-polysaccharides (arabinogalactan), 4-peptidoglycan, 5-plasma membrane, 6-lipoarabinomannan (LAM), 7-phosphatidylinositol mannoside, 8-cell wall skeleton Mycobacteria are aerobic. They are bacillary in form, at least in most phases that have attracted human microbiological attention to date; they are straight or slightly curved rods between 0.2 and 0.6 ¬µm wide and between 1.0 and 10 ¬µm long. They are generally nonmotile bacteria, except for the species Mycobacterium marinum, which has been shown to be motile within macrophages. They are characteristically acid-fast. Mycobacteria have an outer membrane. They possess capsules, and most do not form endospores. M. marinum and perhaps M. bovis have been shown to sporulate; however, this has been contested by further research. The distinguishing characteristic of all Mycobacterium species is that the cell wall is thicker than in many other bacteria, being hydrophobic, waxy, and rich in mycolic acids/mycolates. The cell wall consists of the hydrophobic mycolate layer and a peptidoglycan layer held together by a polysaccharide, arabinogalactan. The cell wall makes a substantial contribution to the hardiness of this genus. The biosynthetic pathways of cell wall components are potential targets for new drugs for tuberculosis. Many Mycobacterium species adapt readily to growth on very simple substrates, using ammonia or amino acids as nitrogen sources and glycerol as a carbon source in the presence of mineral salts. Optimum growth temperatures vary widely according to the species and range from 25 ¬∞C to over 50 ¬∞C. Most Mycobacterium species, including most clinically relevant species, can be cultured in blood agar. However, some species grow very slowly due to extremely long reproductive cycles‚ÄîM. leprae, may take more than 20 days to proceed through one division cycle (for comparison, some E. coli strains take only 20 minutes), making laboratory culture a slow process. In addition, the availability of genetic manipulation techniques still lags far behind that of other bacterial species. A natural division occurs between slowly- and rapidly-growing species. Mycobacteria that form colonies clearly visible to the naked eye within 7 days on subculture are termed rapid growers, while those requiring longer periods are termed slow growers. =Pigmentation= Some mycobacteria produce carotenoid pigments without light. Others require photoactivation for pigment production. ;Photochromogens (Group I) :Produce nonpigmented colonies when grown in the dark and pigmented colonies only after exposure to light and reincubation. :* Ex: M. kansasii, M. marinum, M. simiae. ;Scotochromogens (Group II) :Produce deep yellow to orange colonies when grown in the presence of either the light or the dark. :* Ex: M. scrofulaceum, M. gordonae, M. szulgai. ;Non-chromogens (Groups III and IV) :Nonpigmented in the light and dark or have only a pale yellow, buff or tan pigment that does not intensify after light exposure. :* Ex: M. tuberculosis, M. avium-intra- cellulare, M. bovis, M. ulcerans, M. xenopi :* Ex: M. fortuitum, M. chelonae =Staining characteristics= Mycobacteria are classical acid-fast organisms. Stains used in evaluation of tissue specimens or microbiological specimens include Fite's stain, Ziehl-Neelsen stain, and Kinyoun stain.''' Mycobacteria appear phenotypically most closely related to members of Nocardia, Rhodococcus, and Corynebacterium.  Ecology  Mycobacteria are widespread organisms, typically living in water (including tap water treated with chlorine) and food sources. Some, however, including the tuberculosis and the leprosy organisms, appear to be obligate parasites and are not found as free- living members of the genus.  Pathogenicity  Mycobacteria can colonize their hosts without the hosts showing any adverse signs. For example, billions of people around the world have asymptomatic infections of M. tuberculosis (Latent TB). Mycobacterial infections are notoriously difficult to treat. The organisms are hardy due to their cell wall, which is neither truly Gram negative nor positive. In addition, they are naturally resistant to a number of antibiotics that disrupt cell-wall biosynthesis, such as penicillin. Due to their unique cell wall, they can survive long exposure to acids, alkalis, detergents, oxidative bursts, lysis by complement, and many antibiotics. Most mycobacteria are susceptible to the antibiotics clarithromycin and rifamycin, but antibiotic-resistant strains have emerged. As with other bacterial pathogens, M. tuberculosis produces a number of surface and secreted proteins that contribute to its virulence. However, the mechanism by which these proteins contribute to virulence remains unknown. = Medical classification = Mycobacteria can be classified into several major groups for purpose of diagnosis and treatment: M. tuberculosis complex, which can cause tuberculosis: M. tuberculosis, M. bovis, M. africanum, and M. microti; M. leprae, which causes Hansen's disease or leprosy; nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are all the other mycobacteria, which can cause pulmonary disease resembling tuberculosis, lymphadenitis, skin disease, or disseminated disease.  Mycosides  Mycosides are glycolipid compounds isolated from Mycobacterium that contain varying lipid, carbohydrate, and amino acid moieties. Mycosides A and B have 18 and 20 carbon atoms, respectively. Genomics Comparative analyses of mycobacterial genomes have identified several conserved indels and signature proteins that are uniquely found in all sequenced species from the genus Mycobacterium. Additionally, 14 proteins are found only in the species from the genera Mycobacterium and Nocardia, suggesting that these two genera are closely related. The genomes of some mycobacteria are quite large when compared to other bacteria. For instance, the genome of M. vulneris encodes 6,653 proteins, which is larger than that of small eukaryotes such as yeast (which encodes only ~6,000 proteins). Evolution M. ulcerans evolved from M. marinum.Vandelannoote K, Meehan CJ, Eddyani M, Affolabi D, Phanzu DM, Eyangoh S, Jordaens K, Portaels F, Mangas K, Seemann T, Marsollier L, Marion E, Chauty A, Landier J, Fontanet A, Leirs H, Stinear TP, de Jong BC1 (2017). \\"Multiple Introductions and Recent Spread of the Emerging Human Pathogen Mycobacterium ulcerans across Africa\\".

The sequences of the genus Mycobacterium that matched most closely to those of M. tuberculosis were retrieved from the BIBI database (http://pbil.univ-lyon.fr/bibi/) and aligned with those obtained for 17 smooth and MTBC strains. The unrooted neighbor-joining tree is based on 1,325 aligned nucleotide positions of the 16S rRNA gene. The scale gives the pairwise distances after Jukes-Cantor correction. Bootstrap support values higher than 90% are indicated at the nodes. Phenotypic tests can be used to identify and distinguish different mycobacteria species and strains. In older systems, mycobacteria are grouped based upon their appearance and rate of growth. However, these are symplesiomorphies, and more recent classification is based upon cladistics. Over 100 species are currently recognised. O'Neill and coworkers recently presented a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis based on an alignment of core genomes of 57 strains of bacteria, including all available mycobacteria. =Slowly growing= Runyon's group I, II and III Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex Also see main article about Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex * Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) members are causative agents of human and animal tuberculosis.

History  In 1861, the Indian High Courts Act 1861 was enacted to create high courts for various provinces and abolished supreme courts at Calcutta, Madras and Bombay and also the sadar adalats in presidency towns in their respective regions. These new high courts had the distinction of being the highest courts for all cases till the creation of the Federal Court of India under the Government of India Act 1935. The Federal Court had jurisdiction to solve disputes between provinces and federal states and hear appeals against judgement of the high courts. The first CJI of India was H. J. Kania. The Supreme Court of India came into being on 28 January 1950.History of the Supreme Court of India It replaced both the Federal Court of India and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council which were then at the apex of the Indian court system. The first proceedings and inauguration, however, took place on 28 January 1950 at 9:45 am, when the judges took their seats. Which is thus regarded as the official date of establishment. Evolution of Judiciary The Supreme Court initially had its seat at the Chamber of Princes in the parliament building where the previous Federal Court of India sat from 1937 to 1950. The first Chief Justice of India was H. J. Kania. In 1958, the Supreme Court moved to its present premises. Originally, the Constitution of India envisaged a supreme court with a chief justice and seven judges; leaving it to the parliament to increase this number. In formative years, the Supreme Court met from 10 to 12 in the morning and then 2 to 4 in the afternoon for 28 days in a month.name=\\"History PDF\\" Members of Collegium Presently, the Members of Collegium are: *Sharad Arvind Bobde (CJI) *N. V. Ramana (Judge) *Rohinton Fali Nariman (Judge) *Uday Umesh Lalit (Judge) *Ajay Manikrao Khanwilkar (Judge)  Court building architecture  Central Wing of the court where the chief justice's courtroom is located The building is shaped to symbolize scales of justice with its centre-beam being the Central Wing of the building, consisting of the Chief Justice's court, the largest of the courtrooms, with two court halls on either side. The Right Wing of the structure has the Bar, consisting of rooms, the offices of the Attorney General of India and other law officers and the library of the court. The Left Wing has the offices of the court. In all, there are 15 courtrooms in the various wings of the building. Left side of the supreme court building The foundation stone of the supreme court's building was laid on 29 October 1954 by Dr. Rajendra Prasad, the first President of India. The main block of the building has been built on a triangular plot of 17 acres and has been designed in an Indo-British style by the chief architect Ganesh Bhikaji Deolalikar, the first Indian to head the Central Public Works Department. It has a high dome and a spacious colonnaded verandah. The court moved into the building in 1958. In 1979, two new wingsthe East Wing and the West Wingwere added to the complex. 1994 saw the last extension. = Mother and Child Sculpture = Mother and Child Sculpture On 20 February 1980, a black bronze sculpture of height was installed in the lawn of the supreme court. It portrays Mother India in the form of the figure of a lady, sheltering the young Republic of India represented by the symbol of a child, who is upholding the laws of land symbolically shown in the form of an open book. On the book, a balance beam is shown, which represents dispensation of equal justice to all. The sculpture was made by the renowned artist Chintamoni Kar. The sculpture is just behind the statue of Mahatma Gandhi. = Seal = The design of the Court's seal is reproduced from the wheel that appears on the Sarnath Lion capital of Ashoka with 24 spokes. The inscription in Sanskrit, ‡§Ø‡§§‡•ã ‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§§‡•ã ‡§ú‡§Ø‡§É (IAST: , means \\"whence justice (dharma), thence victory\\". It is also referred as the wheel of righteousness, encompassing truth, goodness and equity.  Constitution of the court  Supreme Court building with the sculpture in the foreground = Registry = The registry of the supreme court is headed by the Secretary- General who is currently assisted by 10 registrars, several additional and deputy registrars, etc. Article 146 of the Constitution deals with the appointments of officers and servants of the supreme court registry. = Supreme court advocates = Supreme Court Rules, 2013 entitle only those advocates who are registered with the supreme court, called advocates-on- record to appear, act and plead for a party in the court. Those advocates who are designated as 'senior advocates' by the supreme court or any of the high courts can appear for clients along with an advocate-on-record. Any other advocate can appear for a party along with or under instructions from an advocate-on-record.  Composition  = Size of the court = Initially, the Constitution of India provided for a supreme court with a chief justice and 7 judges. In the early years, a full bench of the Supreme Court sat together to hear the cases presented before them. As the work of the Court increased and cases began to accumulate, Parliament increased the number of judges (including the Chief Justice) from the original 8 in 1950 to 11 in 1956, 14 in 1960, 18 in 1978, 26 in 1986, 31 in 2009, to 34 in 2019. As the number of the judges has increased, they sit in smaller benches of two or three (referred to as a division bench)‚Äîcoming together in larger benches of five or more (referred to as a constitution bench) when required to settle fundamental questions of law. A bench may refer a case before it to a larger bench, should the need arise. Cases involving Interpretation of the Constitution are heard by at least a 5 judge bench as provided under Article 145(3). The largest-ever bench at the Supreme Court of India has been constituted in 1973 in Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala. A bench of 13 judges was set up to decide whether Parliament had the unfettered right to amend the Constitution or not that eventually gave rise to the Basic Structure doctrine. = Eligibility of a judge of the Supreme Court = A citizen of India not exceeding 65 years age per Article 124 of the Constitution who has been: * a judge of one high court or more (continuously), for at least five years, * an advocate there, for at least ten years, * a distinguished jurist, in the opinion of the president, power conferred by clause 2 of article 124 of the Constitution of India is eligible to be recommended for appointment, a judge of the supreme court. A supreme court's judge has 6th highest government salary in india. = Court demographics = In practice, judges of the supreme court have been selected so far, mostly from amongst judges of the high courts. Barely seven justices‚ÄîS. M. Sikri, S. Chandra Roy, Kuldip Singh, Santosh Hegde, R. F. Nariman, U. U. Lalit, L. Nageswara Rao and Indu Malhotra‚Äîhave been appointed to the supreme court directly from the bar (i.e., who were practising advocates). The Supreme Court saw its first woman judge when Justice M. Fathima Beevi was sworn into office in 1989. The seventh and the most recent woman judge in the court is Justice Indu Malhotra. In 1968, Justice Mohammad Hidayatullah became the first Muslim Chief Justice of India. In 2000, Justice K. G. Balakrishnan became the first judge from the dalit community. In 2007 he also became the first dalit Chief Justice of India. In 2010, Justice S. H. Kapadia coming from a Parsi minority community became the Chief Justice of India. In 2017, Justice Jagdish Singh Khehar became the first Sikh Chief Justice of India. Indu Malhotra is the first woman justice to be selected directly from the bar.  Judicial independence  The Constitution seeks to ensure the independence of supreme court judges in various ways. Per Article 50 of directive principles of state policy, the state shall take steps to separate the judiciary from the executive. Independence of the judiciary, the supremacy of the constitution and rule of law are the features of the basic structure of the Constitution. Supreme court and high courts are empowered to frame suo moto cases without receiving the formal petitions/complaints on any suspected injustice including actions/acts indulging in contempt of court and contempt of the Constitution by the executive, legislators, citizens, etc. It is considered as one of the most independent court in the whole South East Asia. The main purpose of Supreme Court is to decide constitutional issues. It is the duty of the judiciary to frame suo moto cases or to probe the cases/petitions at the earliest against the executive or legislature when laws are implemented violating the basic foundation and basic structure of the Constitution as the Article 38 (1) of directive principles ensures that the state/judiciary shall strive to promote the welfare of the people by securing a social order in which social, economic and political justice is animated/informed in all institutions of life. B. R. Ambedkar clarified as given below in the Constituent Assembly debates on Article 38 (1) high lighting its inevitable implementation. = Appointments and the Collegium = Per the constitution, as held by the court in the Three Judges Cases ‚Äì (1982, 1993, 1998), a judge is appointed to the supreme court by the president on the recommendation of the collegium ‚Äî a closed group of the Chief Justice of India, the four most senior judges of the court and the senior-most judge hailing from the high court of a prospective appointee. This has resulted in a Memorandum of Procedure being followed, for the appointments. Judges used to be appointed by the president on the advice of the union cabinet. After 1993 (the Second Judges' Case), no minister, or even the executive collectively, can suggest any names to the president, who ultimately decides on appointing them from a list of names recommended only by the collegium of the judiciary. Simultaneously, as held in that judgment, the executive was given the power to reject a recommended name. However, according to some, the executive has not been diligent in using this power to reject the names of bad candidates recommended by the judiciary. The collegium system has come under a fair amount of criticism. In 2015, the parliament passed a law to replace the collegium with a National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC). This was struck down as unconstitutional by the supreme court, in the Fourth Judges' Case, as the new system would undermine the independence of the judiciary. Putting the old system of the collegium back, the court invited suggestions, even from the general public, on how to improve the collegium system, broadly along the lines ofsetting up an eligibility criteria for appointments, a permanent secretariat to help the collegium sift through material on potential candidates, infusing more transparency into the selection process, grievance redressal and any other suggestion not in these four categories, like transfer of judges. This resulted in the court asking the government and the collegium to finalize the memorandum of procedure incorporating the above. Once, in 2009, the recommendation for the appointment of a judge of a high court made by the collegium of that court, had come to be challenged in the supreme court. The court held that who could become a judge was a matter of fact, and any person had a right to question it. But who should become a judge was a matter of opinion and could not be questioned. As long as an effective consultation took place within a collegium in arriving at that opinion, the content or material placed before it to form the opinion could not be called for scrutiny in court. = Tenure = Supreme court judges retire at the age of 65. However, there have been suggestions from the judges of the Supreme Court of India to provide for a fixed term for the judges including the Chief Justice of India. = Salary = Article 125 of the Indian constitution leaves it to the Indian parliament to determine the salary, other allowances, leave of absence, pension, etc. of the supreme court judges. However, the parliament cannot alter any of these privileges rights to the judge's disadvantage after his/her appointment.s:Constitution of India/Part V#Article 125 {Salaries, etc., of Judges} A judge of the supreme court draws a salary of per month‚Äîequivalent to the most-senior civil servant of the Indian government, Cabinet Secretary of India‚Äîwhile the chief justice earns per month. =Oath or affirmation= Per Article 124 and third Schedule of the constitution, the chief justice (or a judge) of the Supreme Court of India is required to make and subscribe in the presence of the president an oath or affirmation that he/she =Removal= Article 124(4) of the constitution, President can remove a judge on proved misbehaviour or incapacity when parliament approves with a majority of the total membership of each house in favour of impeachment and not less than two thirds of the members of each house present. For initiating impeachment proceedings against a judge, at least 50 members of Rajya Sabha or 100 members of Lok Sabha shall issue the notice per Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968. Then a judicial committee would be formed to frame charges against the judge, to conduct the fair trial and to submit its report to parliament. When the judicial committee report finds the judge guilty of misbehaviour or incapacity, further removal proceedings would be taken up by the parliament if the judge is not resigning himself. The judge upon proven guilty is also liable for punishment per applicable laws or for contempt of the constitution by breaching the oath under disrespecting constitution = Post-retirement = A Person who has retired as a judge of the supreme court is debarred from practicing in any court of law or before any other authority in India. However, Supreme Court and high court judges are appointed to various posts in tribunals and commissions, after their retirement. Lawyer Ashish Goel in a recent article criticized this stating that post-retirement benefits for judges hampers judicial independence. Former Law Minister and Senior Advocate of the Supreme Court, Arun Jaitley, also criticized the appointment of judges in government posts after their retirement. Jaitley famously said:\\"There are two kinds of judges - those who know the law and those who know the Law Minister. We are the only country in the world where judges appoint judges. Even though there is a retirement age, judges are not willing to retire. Pre-retirement judgements are influenced by post-retirement jobs.\\" = Review petition = Article 137 of the Constitution of India lays down provision for the power of the supreme court to review its own judgements. Per this Article, subject to the provisions of any law made by parliament or any rules made under Article 145, the supreme court shall have power to review any judgment pronounced or order made by it.Supreme court can nullify any decision of parliament and government on the basis of violation of basic features. It can overrule the impeachment process of the President and Judges which is passed by the parliament on the basis of constitutional validity or basic features. Under Order XL of the supreme court Rules, that have been framed under its powers under Article 145 of the constitution, the supreme court may review its judgment or order but no application for review is to be entertained in a civil proceeding except on the grounds mentioned in Order XLVII, Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure. = Powers to punish for contempt = Under Articles 129 and 142 of the constitution the supreme court has been vested with power to punish anyone for contempt of any court in India including itself. The supreme court performed an unprecedented action when it directed a sitting minister of state in Maharashtra government, Swaroop Singh Naik,Maha minister gets jail for contempt to be jailed for 1-month on a charge of contempt of court on 12 May 2006.  Rules  Article 145 of the Constitution of India empowers the Supreme Court to frame its own rules (with Presidential approval) for regulating court practice and procedures. Three versions of the rules have been published: the first in 1950, then in 1966 and 2013.  Roster system  The supreme court decided to follow a new roster system from 5 February 2018 for allocation of matters to judges. Under the new roster system, the CJI will hear all special leave petitions (SLPs), and matters related to public interest, social justice, elections, arbitration, and criminal matters, among others. The other collegium/senior judges to hear matters related to labour disputes, taxation matters, compensation matters, consumer protection matters, maritime law matters, mortgage matters, personal law matters, family law matters, land acquisition matters, service matters, company matters etc.  Reporting and citation  Supreme Court Reports is the official journal of reportable supreme court decisions. It is published under the authority of the Supreme Court of India by the Controller of Publications, Government of India, Delhi. In addition, there are many other reputed private journals that report supreme court decisions. Some of these other important journals are: SCR (The Supreme Court Reports), SCC (Supreme Court Cases), AIR (All India Reporter), SCALE, etc.  Right to Information  In the year 2010, the supreme court filed an appeal before itself challenging the judgement of the Delhi high court holding that the office of the chief justice of India came under the ambit of the RTI Act and was liable to reveal information under it. Though the supreme court is in favour of bringing CJI office under RTI act, in 13-11-2019 the chief Justice of India office was brought under RTI Act by a majority judgement.  Facilities in the campus  Legal-aid, court-fee vendors, first-aid post, dental clinic, physiotherapy unit and pathology lab; rail-reservation counter, canteen, post office and a branch and 3 ATMs of UCO Bank, supreme court Museum can be availed by litigants and visitors.  Landmark judgments  = Land reform = After some of the courts overturned state laws for redistributing land from zamindar (landlord) estates on the ground that the laws violated the zamindars' fundamental rights, the parliament passed the 1st amendment to the constitution in 1951, followed by the 4th amendment in 1955, to uphold its authority to redistribute land. The supreme court countered these amendments in 1967 when it ruled in Golaknath v. State of Punjab that the parliament did not have the power to abrogate fundamental rights, including the provisions on private property. The 25th amendment to the constitution in 1971 curtailed the right of a citizen to property as a fundamental right and gave authority to the government to infringe private property, which led to a furor amongst the zamindars. = Emergency (1975‚Äì1977) = The independence of the judiciary was severely curtailed during the Indian Emergency (1975‚Äì1977) of Indira Gandhi. The constitutional rights of imprisoned persons were restricted under preventive detention laws passed by Parliament. In the case of Shiva Kant Shukla (Additional District Magistrate of Jabalpur v. Shiv Kant Shukla), popularly known as the Habeas Corpus case, a bench of five senior-most judges of the supreme court ruled in favour of the state's right to unrestricted powers of detention during the emergency. Justices A.N. Ray, P. N. Bhagwati, Y. V. Chandrachud, and M.H. Beg, stated in the majority decision: :(under the declaration of emergency) no person has any locus to move any writ petition under Art. 226 before a High Court for habeas corpus or any other writ or order or direction to challenge the legality of an order of detention. The only dissenting opinion was from Justice H. R. Khanna, who stated: :detention without trial is an anathema to all those who love personal liberty... A dissent is an appeal to the brooding spirit of the law, to the intelligence of a future day, when a later decision may possibly correct the error into which the dissenting judge believes the court to have been betrayed. It is believed that before delivering his dissenting opinion, Justice Khanna had mentioned to his sister: \\"I have prepared my judgment, which is going to cost me the Chief Justice-ship of India.\\" In January 1977, Justice Khanna was superseded despite being the most senior judge at the time and thereby the government broke the convention of appointing only the seniormost judge to the position of Chief Justice of India. Justice Khanna remains a legendary figure among the legal fraternity in India for this decision. The New York Times, wrote of this opinion: \\"The submission of an independent judiciary to absolutist government is virtually the last step in the destruction of a democratic society; and the Indian supreme court's decision appears close to utter surrender.\\" During the emergency period, the government also passed the 39th amendment, which sought to limit judicial review for the election of the prime minister; only a body constituted by parliament could review this election. Subsequently, Parliament, with most opposition members in jail during the emergency, passed the 42nd Amendment which prevented any court from reviewing any amendment to the constitution with the exception of procedural issues concerning ratification. A few years after the emergency, however, the supreme court rejected the absoluteness of the 42nd amendment and reaffirmed its power of judicial review in Minerva Mills v. Union of India (1980). = Post-1980: an assertive court = After Indira Gandhi lost elections in 1977, the new government of Morarji Desai, and especially law minister Shanti Bhushan (who had earlier argued for the detenues in the Habeas Corpus case), introduced a number of amendments making it more difficult to declare and sustain an emergency, and reinstated much of the power to the supreme court. It is said that the basic structure doctrine, created in Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala, was strengthened in Indira Gandhi's case and set in stone in Minerva Mills v. Union of India. The supreme court's creative and expansive interpretations of Article 21 (Life and Personal Liberty), primarily after the Emergency period, have given rise to a new jurisprudence of public interest litigation that has vigorously promoted many important economic and social rights (constitutionally protected but not enforceable) including, but not restricted to, the rights to free education, livelihood, a clean environment, food and many others. Civil and political rights (traditionally protected in the Fundamental Rights chapter of the Indian constitution) have also been expanded and more fiercely protected. These new interpretations have opened the avenue for litigation on a number of important issues. = Recent important cases = Among the important pronouncements of the supreme court post 2000 is the Coelho case I.R. Coelho v. State of Tamil Nadu (Judgment of 11 January 2007). A unanimous bench of 9 judges reaffirmed the basic structure doctrine. It held that a constitutional amendment which entails violation of any fundamental rights which the court regards as forming part of the basic structure of the constitution can be struck down depending upon its impact and consequences. The judgment clearly imposes further limitations on the constituent power of Parliament with respect to the principles underlying certain fundamental rights. The judgment in Coelho has in effect restored the decision in Golaknath case regarding non-amendability of the constitution on account of infraction of fundamental rights, contrary to the judgment in the Kesavananda Bharati case. Another important decision was of the five-judge bench in Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. Union of India; where the constitutional validity of Central Educational Institutions (Reservations in Admissions) Act, 2006 was upheld, subject to the \\"creamy layer\\" criteria. Importantly, the court refused to follow the 'strict scrutiny' standards of review followed by the United States supreme court. At the same time, the court has applied the strict scrutiny standards in Anuj Garg v. Hotel Association of India (2007) ()a  2G spectrum case  The supreme court declared allotment of spectrum as \\"unconstitutional and arbitrary\\" and quashed all the 122 licenses issued in 2008 during tenure of A. Raja (then Minister for communications & IT), the main official accused in the 2G case.2G scam: SC scraps 122 licences granted under Raja's tenure, trial court to decide on Chidambaram's role ‚Äì Times Of India . Articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com (2 February 2012). Retrieved on 2013-07-18.  Black money  The government refused to disclose details of about 18 Indians holding accounts in LGT Bank, Liechtenstein, evoking a sharp response from a bench comprising justices B Sudershan Reddy and S S Nijjar... The court ordered Special investigation team (SIT) to probe the matter. Lack of enthusiasm made the court create a special investigative team (SIT).  Minority reservations  The supreme court upheld the Andhra Pradesh High Court judgement quashing 4.5% sub-quota for minorities under OBC reservation quota of 27%.  Online/postal ballot for Indian citizen living abroad (NRIs)  Three judge bench presided by the then Chief Justice of India Altamas Kabir issued notice to the Union government and the Election Commission of India (EC) on the PIL filed by a group of NRIs for online/postal ballot for the Indian citizens living abroad.  T. S. R. Subramanian vs. Union of India  While hearing T.S.R. Subramanian vs Union of India, a division bench of the supreme court ruled that‚Äî * Officers of the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), officers other All India Services, and other civil servants were not required to follow oral instructions, as they 'undermine credibility'. * A Civil Services Board (CSB), headed by the Cabinet Secretary at national level, and Chief Secretary at state level, be set up to recommend transfer/postings of the officers of the All India Services (IAS, IFoS and IPS). * Transfers of Group 'B' officers were to be done by the Heads of Departments (HoDs). * There was to be no interference of Ministers in state, other than the Chief Minister, in transfers/postings of civil servants. These rulings were received mostly positively, and were termed as 'major reform(s)'.  Recognition of transgender as 'third gender' in law  In April 2014, Justice K. S. Radhakrishnan declared transgender to be the 'third gender' in Indian law, in the case, National Legal Services Authority v. Union of India. The ruling said: > Seldom, our society realises or cares to realise the trauma, agony and pain > which the members of Transgender community undergo, nor appreciates the > innate feelings of the members of the Transgender community, especially of > those whose mind and body disown their biological sex. Our society often > ridicules and abuses the Transgender community and in public places like > railway stations, bus stands, schools, workplaces, malls, theatres [and] > hospitals; they are sidelined and treated as untouchables, forgetting the > fact that the moral failure lies in the society's unwillingness to contain > or embrace different gender identities and expressions, a mindset which we > have to change. Justice Radhakrishnan said that transgender people should be treated consistently with other minorities under the law, enabling them to access jobs, healthcare and education. He framed the issue as one of human rights, saying that, \\"These TGs, even though insignificant in numbers, are still human beings, and therefore, they have every right to enjoy their human rights,\\" concluding by declaring that: (1) Hijras, eunuchs, apart from binary gender, were to be treated as \\"third gender\\" for the purpose of safeguarding their rights under Part III of the Indian Constitution and the laws made by Parliament and the State Legislatures. (2) Transgender persons' right to decide their self-identified gender was to be upheld and that the Union and State Governments were to grant legal recognition of their gender identity such as male, female or as third gender.  Relief to over 35,000 public servants  In B.Prabhakara Rao vs. State of A.P. involved sudden reduction in age of superannuation from 58 years to 55 years of over 35,000 public servants of State Government, public sector undertakings, statutory bodies, educational institutions and Tirupathi-Tirumalai Devasthanams (TTD). They lost first round of litigation in the supreme court. Realizing the mistake, fresh legislation was brought restoring the original age of superannuation of 58 years but providing that the benefit of new legislation would not extend to those whose reduction of age of superannuation had been upheld. In challenge to this law, Subodh Markandeya argued that all that was required was to strike down naughty \\"not\\" ‚Äì which found favour with the supreme court bringing relief to over 35,000 public servants.  Decriminalisation of homosexuality  On 6 September 2018, a five-member constitutional bench decriminalised homosexuality by partially striking down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code in the case Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India. The bench led by Dipak Misra unanimously declared that criminalisation of private consensual sex between adult persons of the same sex under Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code was clearly unconstitutional. The court, however, held that the section would apply to bestiality, sex with minors and non consensual sexual acts.  Ayodhya dispute  A political, historical, and socio-religious debate, the Ayodhya dispute has been going on since 1961 when the first case was filed in court. The Supreme Court, after a marathon 40 day hearing which concluded on 16 October, reserved the decision and revealed it on 9 November 2019 stating that the disputed land will be given to Hindus and also ruled that the Muslim community will be given an alternative piece of 5 acre land for the construction of a mosque. This was one of the biggest decisions before the retirement of Chief Justice of India, Ranjan Gogoi on 17 November 2019.  Critical Assessment = Corruption = The year 2008 saw the supreme court embroiled in several controversies, from serious allegations of corruption at the highest level of the judiciary,Ex-chief justice under corruption panel scanner, Hindustan Times, New Delhi, 9 June 2008 expensive private holidays at the tax payers expense,Are judges holidaying at public expense? , May 2008 refusal to divulge details of judges' assets to the public,Judges' asset declaration before CJI not for public eye: SC to CIC, The Indian Express, 6 November 2008 secrecy in the appointments of judges',The case of judicial injustice, The Indian Express, 31 March 1999 to refusal to make information public under the Right to Information Act.RTI Act does not apply to my office: CJI , The Times of India, 20 April 2008 The chief justice K. G. Balakrishnan invited a lot of criticism for his comments on his post not being that of a public servant, but that of a constitutional authority.Is the CJI a public servant? , The Times of India, 22 April 2008 He later went back on this stand.I am a public servant: CJI , The Times of India, 6 May 2008 The judiciary has come in for serious criticisms from former presidents Pratibha Patil and A. P. J. Abdul Kalam for failure in handling its duties.Delayed justice leading to lynching mobs: Pratibha, The Times of India, 24 February 2008 Former prime minister Manmohan Singh, has stated that corruption is one of the major challenges facing the judiciary, and suggested that there is an urgent need to eradicate this menace.Manmohan Singh calls for check on corruption in judiciary , Thaindian News, 19 April 2008 The Cabinet Secretary of India introduced the judges Inquiry (Amendment) Bill 2008 in parliament for setting up of a panel called the National Judicial Council, headed by the Chief Justice of India, that will probe into allegations of corruption and misconduct by High Court and supreme court judges.Pass Judges (Inquiry) Bill in next session, panel tells Govt., Zee News, India Edition, 30 September 2008Bill for probe panel against errant judges cleared, iGovernment, 10 October 2008 = Pending cases = According to supreme court newsletter, there are 58,519 cases pending in the supreme court, out of which 37,385 are pending for more than a year, at the end of 2011. Excluding connected cases, there are still 33,892 pending cases. Per the latest pendency data made available by the supreme court, the total number of pending cases in the supreme court as on 1 November 2017 is 55,259 which includes 32,160 admission matters (miscellaneous) and 23,099 regular hearing matters. In May, 2014, former Chief Justice of India, Justice R.M. Lodha, proposed to make Indian judiciary work throughout the year (instead of the present system of having long vacations, specially in the higher courts) in order to reduce pendency of cases in Indian courts; however, per this proposal there is not going to be any increase in the number of working days or working hours of any of the judges and it only meant that different judges would be going on vacation during different periods of the year per their choice; but, the Bar Council of India rejected this proposal mainly because it would have inconvenienced the advocates who would have to work throughout the year. More over, various time frames specified in 'code of civil procedure' are also diluted by supreme court judgements to give the courts right to endlessly adjourn the cases. = Rule of law = Supreme court has not taken up the trail of many pending cases, since April 2014 (more than three years), challenging the validity of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 which was enacted by the Parliament without following the stipulated procedure in the Constitution and is claimed detrimental to the basic foundation of the constitution on which the basic structure of the constitution is resting. The basic foundation of the constitution is the dignity and the freedom of its citizens which is of supreme importance and can not be destroyed by any legislation of the parliament. Whereas the fair trial to examine the validity of the ninety-ninth constitutional amendment dated 31 December 2014, to form National Judicial Appointments Commission for the purpose of appointing the judges of the supreme court and high courts, was conducted on utmost priority and supreme court delivered its judgement on 16 October 2015 (within a year) quashing the constitutional amendment as unconstitutional and ultra vires stating the said amendment is interfering with the independence of the judiciary. Disposal of the various petitions filed against Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 is also equally important as it has alienated the basic rights of a vast section of Indian citizens and also against federal character of the constitution which is part of the basic structure of the constitution. Supreme court is also wasting its valuable time by not taking up the case in toto but conducted a piecemeal trail by delivering its judgement to dispose the petitions related with apportionment of assets between the newly formed states Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Supreme court is also conducting piecemeal trail of the petitions filed by the states regarding water sharing of rivers and bifurcation of the common high court without considering the earlier pending petitions challenging the validity of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 which is the basic cause of all these disputes. Under checks and balances as provided in the Constitution, it is the duty of the judiciary/supreme court to establish the rule of law at the earliest by rectifying any misuse of the Constitution by the parliament and the executive without colluding with them and to remove perceptions of people that rule of law is side lined and a section of its citizens are subjected to discrimination. = Four judges vs chief justice = On 12 January 2018, four senior judges of the supreme court; Jasti Chelameswar, Ranjan Gogoi, Madan Lokur and Kurian Joseph addressed a press conference criticizing Chief Justice Dipak Misra's style of administration and the manner in which he allocated cases among judges of the supreme court. However, people close to Misra refuted the allegations that allocation of cases was unfair. On 20 April 2018, seven opposition parties submitted a petition seeking impeachment of Dipak Misra to the Vice President Venkaiah Naidu, with signatures from seventy-one parliamentarians. On 23 April 2018, the petition was rejected by Vice President Venkaiah Naidu, primarily on the basis that the complaints were about administration and not misbehaviour, and that thus impeachment would seriously interfere with the constitutionally protected independence of the judiciary. =Holidays and working hours= The Supreme court works from 10 am to 4:30 pm, but is closed during winter and summer for 2 weeks each. Some critics feel that this delays pending cases. However, in an interview in June 2018 with NDTV, Justice Chelameswar revealed that most Supreme court judges including him work around 14 hours per day, and continue to work for an average of 7 hours per day even during vacations. He further reminded that the Supreme Court of United States delivers judgement on just 120 cases in a year, while every judge in the Supreme court of India delivers judgements on 1000-1500 cases. = Appointment = It has been pointed out that consensus within the Collegium is occasionally resolved through trade-offs, resulting in unreliable appointments with consequences for litigants There has also been growing sycophancy and \\"lobbying\\" within the system. Justice Chelameswar gave evidence from existing records to argue this point. In one case, \\"a judge was blocked from elevation to the Madras High Court in 2009, in what appeared to have been a joint venture in the subversion of the law governing the collegium system by both the executive and the judiciary.\\" =Controversies= On 18 April 2019 an unnamed married woman employee of the Supreme court filed an affidavit stating that the Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi had sexually harassed her on 10‚Äì11 October 2018 by pressing his body against hers against her will. An in-house committee of the Court quickly cleared Gogoi of the sexual harassment charges, although the report of the committee was not provided to the complainant. However, there were widespread protests against the manner in which the woman's complaint was dealt with by Supreme Court. A petition was filed before National Human Rights Commission to obtain the report of the in-house committee. The National Law University topper Survi Karwa skipped her convocation to avoid receiving her degree from Ranjan Gogoi in protest. The in house committee which cleared Gogoi of sexual harassment was chaired by Justice S A Bobde, who himself succeeded Gogoi as chief justice. The woman complainant stated that she was terrified by the systematic victimisation of her family members who were all dismissed from service following her protest against Gogoi's sexual advances. In the sensational Unnao rape case, although the rape victim had written letters to the Chief Justice apprehending death threats, the letter was allegedly not placed before the Court. A few days later the victim's family was wiped out in a road accident reportedly staged by the now convicted rapist and former BJP member Kuldeep Sengar.

Symbol used in drawings Simplified version of a cone penetrometer. The cone penetration or cone penetrometer test (CPT) is a method used to determine the geotechnical engineering properties of soils and delineating soil stratigraphy. It was initially developed in the 1950s at the Dutch Laboratory for Soil Mechanics in Delft to investigate soft soils. Based on this history it has also been called the \\"Dutch cone test\\". Today, the CPT is one of the most used and accepted soil methods for soil investigation worldwide. The test method consists of pushing an instrumented cone, with the tip facing down, into the ground at a controlled rate (controlled between 1.5 -2.5 cm/s accepted). The resolution of the CPT in delineating stratigraphic layers is related to the size of the cone tip, with typical cone tips having a cross-sectional area of either 10 or 15 cm¬≤, corresponding to diameters of 3.6 and 4.4 cm. A very early ultra-miniature 1 cm¬≤ subtraction penetrometer was developed and used on a US mobile ballistic missile launch system (MGM-134 Midgetman) soil/structure design program in 1984 at the Earth Technology Corporation of Long Beach, California.  History and development  The result of a cone penetration test: resistance and friction on the left, friction ratio (%) on the right. The early applications of CPT mainly determined the soil geotechnical property of bearing capacity. The original cone penetrometers involved simple mechanical measurements of the total penetration resistance to pushing a tool with a conical tip into the soil. Different methods were employed to separate the total measured resistance into components generated by the conical tip (the \\"tip friction\\") and friction generated by the rod string. A friction sleeve was added to quantify this component of the friction and aid in determining soil cohesive strength in the 1960s.Begemann, H. K. S, 1965, \\"The Friction Jacket Cone as an Aid in Determining the Soil Profile\\"; Proceedings, 6th ICSMFE, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, Vol I, pp.17-20. Electronic measurements began in 1948 and improved further in the early 1970s.De Reister, J., 1971, \\"Electric Penetrometer for Site Investigations\\"; Journal of SMFE Division, ASCE, Vol. 97, SM-2, pp. 457-472. Most modern electronic CPT cones now also employ a pressure transducer with a filter to gather pore water pressure data. The filter is usually located either on the cone tip (the so-called U1 position), immediately behind the cone tip (the most common U2 position) or behind the friction sleeve (U3 position). Pore water pressure data aids determining stratigraphy and is primarily used to correct tip friction values for those effects. CPT testing which also gathers this piezometer data is called CPTU testing. CPT and CPTU testing equipment generally advances the cone using hydraulic rams mounted on either a heavily ballasted vehicle or using screwed- in anchors as a counter-force. One advantage of CPT over the Standard Penetration Test (SPT) is a more continuous profile of soil parameters, with data recorded at intervals typically of 20 cm but as small as 1 cm. Manufacturers of cone penetrometer probes and data acquisition systems include Hogentogler, which has been acquired by the Vertek Division of Applied Research Associates, GeoPoint Systems BV and Pagani Geotechnical Equipment.  Additional in situ testing parameters  In addition to the mechanical and electronic cones, a variety of other CPT-deployed tools have been developed over the years to provide additional subsurface information. One common tool advanced during CPT testing is a geophone set to gather seismic shear wave and compression wave velocities. This data helps determine the shear modulus and Poisson's ratio at intervals through the soil column for soil liquefaction analysis and low-strain soil strength analysis. Engineers use the shear wave velocity and shear modulus to determine the soil's behavior under low-strain and vibratory loads. Additional tools such as laser-induced fluorescence, X-ray fluorescence, soil conductivity/resistivity,Strutynsky, A.I., R. Sandiford, D. Cavaliere, 1991. Use of Piezometric Cone Penetration Testing with Electrical Conductivity Measurements (CPTU-EC) for Detection of Hydrocarbon Contamination in Saturated Granular Soils. Current Practices in Ground Water and Vadose Zone Investigations, ASTM pH, temperature and membrane interface probe and cameras for capturing video imagery are also increasingly advanced in conjunction with the CPT probe. An additional CPT deployed tool used in Britain, Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and France is a piezocone combined with a tri-axial magnetometer. This is used to attempt to ensure that tests, boreholes, and piles, do not encounter unexploded ordnance (UXO) or duds. The magnetometer in the cone detects ferrous materials of 50 kg or larger within a radius of up to about 2 m distance from the probe depending on the material, orientation and soil conditions.  Standards and use  CPT for geotechnical applications was standardized in 1986 by ASTM Standard D 3441 (ASTM, 2004). ISSMGE provides international standards on CPT and CPTU. Later ASTM Standards have addressed the use of CPT for various environmental site characterization and groundwater monitoring activities.ASTM 6001ASTM 6067Strutynsky, A.I., T. Sainey, 1990. Use of the Piezometric Cone Penetration Test and Penetrometer Groundwater Sampling for Volatile Organic Contaminant Plume Detection. Petroleum Hydrocarbons and Organic Chemicals in Groundwater: Prevention, Detection and Restoration. API/NWWA For geotechnical soil investigations, CPT is more popular compared to SPT as a method of geotechnical soil investigation. Its increased accuracy, speed of deployment, more continuous soil profile and reduced cost over other soil testing methods. The ability to advance additional in situ testing tools using the CPT direct push drilling rig, including the seismic tools described above, are accelerating this process.

Someone who has that right is a Hong Kong permanent resident. Foreign nationals may acquire the right of abode after meeting a seven-year residency requirement and are given most rights usually associated with citizenship, including the right to vote in regional elections. However, they are not entitled to hold territorial passports or stand for office in most Legislative Council constituencies, unless they also naturalise as Chinese citizens. As a special administrative region of China, Hong Kong does not have its own nationality law and natural- born residents are generally Chinese citizens. Prior to 1997, the territory was a colony of the United Kingdom and right of abode was tied to British nationality law. Although Hong Kong, mainland China, and Macau constitute a single country, local residents with Chinese citizenship do not have automatic residence rights in either of the other two jurisdictions, which both control immigration separately. Conversely, mainland Chinese and Macanese residents do not automatically have residence or employment rights in Hong Kong.  History  = Colonial era policy = Hong Kong was a British colony from 1842 until its transfer to China in 1997.. Accordingly, regulations on local residence rights were closely tied to British nationality law during colonial rule.. All British subjects previously had unrestricted access to live and work in any British territory.. Parliament gradually restricted this from 1962 to 1971, when subjects originating from outside of the British Islands first had immigration controls imposed on them when entering the United Kingdom.. Hong Kong followed suit and imposed greater restrictions on subjects from outside the territory. British subjects born in the colony were given belonger status, to indicate their possession of right of abode in Hong Kong.. Nationality law reform in 1981 reclassified the vast majority of Hong Kong belongers as British Dependent Territories citizens (BDTCs).., p. 31. The border between Hong Kong and mainland China was not regulated for over 100 years after establishment of the colony.. Border controls did not exist until 1950, after communist victory in the Chinese Civil War.. Although the border was guarded, the Hong Kong government was relatively lax in deporting illegal immigrants due to a shortage of unskilled labour within the territory, allowing large numbers of them to register as residents.. Still, colonial authorities held almost unlimited discretionary deportation powers over Chinese migrants until 1971, when those resident in the territory for more than seven years were given the right to land. This exempted them from immigration control, though they could still be deported for serious crimes.. Immigration became more restricted in 1974 at the start of the Touch Base Policy. Under this system, illegal immigrants captured by law enforcement were immediately deported but those who had managed to reach urban areas of Hong Kong and found housing accommodation were given legal status. This policy ended in 1980, after which all free migration was stopped. Chinese migrants moving to Hong Kong forfeited their hukou in mainland China and became ineligible for Chinese passports. These individuals were treated as if they were stateless. The colonial government issued Documents of Identity as travel documents to those who could not obtain passports. After seven years of residence, they were issued Certificates of Identity (CIs).. = Transitionary arrangements = The British and Chinese governments entered negotiations over the future of Hong Kong in the early 1980s and agreed on the Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1984.. The basic principles for the right of abode are set as part of this treaty, section XIV. and further defined in the Hong Kong Basic Law, Article 24. which encompass the right to land with the added entitlement that a bearer cannot be deported. Belonger status was renamed permanent resident status in 1987, when landed Chinese residents were given the right of abode along with Hong Kong BDTCs.. All BDTCs who did not have a connection with a remaining British Dependent Territory other than Hong Kong lost BDTC status on 1 July 1997., section 3. Former ethnic Chinese BDTCs became Chinese nationals and could only retain British nationality if they had registered as British Nationals (Overseas) prior to the transfer of sovereignty. Individuals who were not ethnically Chinese, had not registered as BN(O)s, and would have been stateless at that date automatically became British Overseas citizens. Holders of CIs were able to replace them with Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passports after the handover.  Acquisition and loss  Becoming a Hong Kong permanent resident has slightly different requirements depending on an individual's nationality. Acquisition by birth operates on a modified jus soli basis; Chinese nationals born in Hong Kong are automatically permanent residents, while foreign nationals must have at least one parent who possesses right of abode., para. 2. Children born outside of Hong Kong acquire right of abode if they are also Chinese nationals at birth. Chinese nationality is usually conferred by descent to children born abroad, unless the parents have obtained permanent residency in another country or foreign citizenship. However, while Chinese nationals born in mainland China to Hong Kong permanent resident parents do have right of abode, they must first be approved for One- way Permits by mainland authorities before claiming permanent residency.. Residents of Macau also do not have automatic right of entry into Hong Kong. Nonresidents seeking to become permanent residents must be ordinarily resident in Hong Kong for a continuous period of at least seven years before becoming eligible for the status., para. 1. Ordinarily resident in this context excludes certain classes of people, including central government officials, foreign domestic helpers, and incarcerated individuals.. Chinese nationals may qualify using any seven-year residence period, while foreigners are only eligible on the basis of the seven years immediately preceding their applications. Individuals from mainland China seeking to settle in Hong Kong are additionally subject to emigration control by the central government. Article 22. Permanent residents who are not Chinese nationals automatically lose the right of abode if they are absent from Hong Kong for more than three years. These individuals are then given the right to land, which also allows them unrestricted access to live and work in the territory. Foreign permanent residents can naturalise as Chinese nationals and become exempt from automatic loss, but are required to renounce their previous nationality on successful application. Children with foreign nationality who were born in Hong Kong and have permanent residency by descent also automatically lose right of abode at age 21 and are given the right to land. They may subsequently reapply for right of abode on the basis of a seven-year residence period. Chinese nationals with right of abode may only be deprived of the status if they lose their Chinese nationality. Prior to 1997, acquisition of the right of abode was dependent on British nationality. Individuals born overseas to Hong Kong- connected BDTCs also became BDTCs and Hong Kong permanent residents by descent.. After the transfer of sovereignty, if these individuals did not also acquire Chinese nationality or return to Hong Kong within three years, they would be nonpermanent residents with the right to land. Individuals who lost permanent resident status before 1997 can immediately resume the right of abode under limited circumstances. Those who returned to settle in Hong Kong within 18 months after the transfer of sovereignty were automatically regranted the status, while former residents who return after that period can only immediately regain the right of abode if they have not been absent from the territory for any period longer than three years., para. 6.  Rights and privileges  Permanent residents have the unrestricted right to live and work in Hong Kong and cannot be deported from the territory, regardless of their nationality.. They are required to register for Hong Kong permanent identity cards. (as opposed to standard identity cards which are issued to any person admitted to the territory for more than 180 days), eligible for welfare benefits,. and able to vote in regional elections.. Chinese nationals with territorial right of abode are eligible to hold Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passports, which are different from those issued to mainland residents. Those who additionally do not possess right of abode in foreign countries may stand for office in geographical constituencies of the Legislative Council. and can serve as principal officials of the government. Articles 44, 55, 61, 71, 90, 101. A limited number of residents with foreign nationality or right of abode in other countries may be elected to functional constituency seats in the legislature.. Article 67.  Restrictions  Hong Kong permanent residents do not have automatic residence or employment rights in mainland China. The central government issues Home Return Permits to residents who are Chinese citizens for travel purposes. and Residence Permits if they intend to reside or work in the mainland for longer than six months.. Hong Kong permanent residents are also subject to immigration controls in Macau, and must obtain residence permits if living there for more than one year., Article 10(2).  Legal challenges to eligibility requirements  The eligibility criteria for right of abode has been a contentious issue and repeatedly challenged in court since the transfer of sovereignty. Because constitutional issues require central government review,. litigation on right of abode issues has highlighted conflicting differences between the legal systems of the territory and mainland. and xenophobic sentiment among local residents.. = Children born in mainland China = In 1999, the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) issued two judgements that granted right of abode in Hong Kong to children born in mainland China with at least one parent who had the right of abode,, at para. 108‚Äì112. including those whose parents had become a permanent resident after the time of birth., at para. 32.. The regional government expected that 1.67 million new immigrants from the mainland would seek to acquire the right of abode on these terms over the next decade, and projected that Hong Kong would not be able to absorb such a sudden population increase.. Although the CFA is the highest territorial court, the Court clarified that its authority to interpret the Basic Law derives from the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC). The government subsequently asked the Standing Committee to provide a new interpretation of Basic Law Article 24, which defines right of abode eligibility, and Article 22, which stipulates that people from other parts of China are required to seek central government approval before entering Hong Kong. The NPCSC duly issued an interpretation that reinforced requirements for mainland exit procedures and restricted eligibility for right of abode to the criteria as it was before the CFA rulings.. The CFA confirmed its effect in local law in Lau Kong Yung v Director of Immigration., at para. 74. While the interpretation resolved the immediate immigration crisis, the constitutionality and legality of bypassing the Court of Final Appeal was widely debated. Many legislators, especially the pro-democracy camp, and the Hong Kong Bar Association believed that amending the Basic Law would have been the appropriate course of remedy. They argued that arbitrary NPCSC interpretations without formal requests for them from the CFA would weaken the principle of \\"one country, two systems\\", damage the rule of law, and erode the authority of the CFA as the territory's final appellate court. Although constitutional judicial review is routine in common law systems, Beijing viewed the process as a limit to its authority as the sovereign power and preferred more flexible interpretation of the law.. Additionally, the regional government believed that revising the Basic Law would delay resolving the issue for too long since amendments require review by the entire National People's Congress, which only meets once each spring. = Children of mainland visitors = The Court of Final Appeal issued a further ruling in 2001 that all Chinese nationals born in Hong Kong would have right of abode in the region, even if neither parent was a permanent resident., at para. 8.3. This change directly led to a growing trend of birth tourism; increasing numbers of expectant mothers from the mainland entered Hong Kong to give birth with the express purpose of exploiting the healthcare system and giving their children permanent residency in the territory. Overcrowding in hospital maternity wards became a major factor in contributing to growing consternation among residents and the emergence of a hostile environment against mainland tourists.. = Foreign domestic helpers = Foreign domestic helpers (FDHs), live-in female household workers mostly from the Philippines, constitute the largest non-Chinese minority group in Hong Kong.. They are not considered ordinarily resident in the territory and cannot claim permanent residency.. Racial tension between these workers and local residents,. pervasive perceptions of FDHs as being lower class,. and a general public unwillingness to integrate them led some FDHs to more actively protest their disadvantaged legal status.. However, in 2013, the Court of Final Appeal upheld existing government exclusion of FDHs from right of abode eligibility in Vallejos v Commissioner of Registration., at para. 89.. A majority of Hongkongers did not support the extension of residency rights to this minority group, fearing an increase in government spending to accommodate them. The current regulatory environment for FDHs, including the lack of access to right of abode,. continues to be criticised for making this class of minorities particularly vulnerable to domestic exploitation and abuse...

Its subject is the 1947 murder of Elizabeth Short in Los Angeles, California, which received wide attention because her corpse was horrifically mutilated and discarded in an empty residential lot. The investigation ultimately led to a broad police corruption scandal. While rooted in the facts of the Short murder and featuring many real-life people, places and events, Ellroy's novel blends facts and fiction, notably in solving Short's crime when in reality her murder was unsolved. James Ellroy dedicated The Black Dahlia, \\"To Geneva Hilliker Ellroy 1915-1958 Mother: Twenty-nine Years Later, This Valediction in Blood.\\" The epigraph for The Black Dahlia is \\"Now I fold you down, my drunkard, my navigator, My first lost keeper, to love and look at later. -Anne Sexton.\\" This book is considered the one that gained Ellroy critical attention as a serious writer of literature, expanding his renown beyond the crime novels of his early career.. The Black Dahlia is the first book in Ellroy's L.A. Quartet, a cycle of novels set in 1940s and 1950s Los Angeles. He portrays the city in this period as a hotbed of political corruption and depravity. The Quartet continues with The Big Nowhere, L.A. Confidential, and White Jazz. Synopsis During World War II, LAPD officer Dwight \\"Bucky\\" Bleichert, a former boxer, is estranged from his father, a Nazi-sympathizer. When his father's membership in the German American Bund is discovered by the police, Bucky is forced to allow two Japanese-American friends to be sent to an internment camp, for which he feels guilt. During the Zoot Suit Riots, Bucky meets Lee Blanchard, who is rising through the ranks in the department. Lee's career is threatened, however, because of his cohabitation with Kay Lake, in violation of LAPD policy. Kay is the former girlfriend of a gangster whose arrest by Lee helped make his reputation. In November 1946, Bucky and Lee are coerced into a boxing match which is being held to promote a proposed bond measure to increase the LAPD's budget. Bucky, outweighed and outclassed, initially tries to throw the fight, as his winnings would be enough to put his dementia-addled father into a good nursing home, but decides to win as that would get him a plainclothes job in the Warrants Division. He fails, but he gets the Warrants job anyway. Partnered with Lee, the two men quickly become friends. They work well together until an arrest goes wrong and they kill four men in a gunfight. Meanwhile, Kay becomes attracted to Bucky, telling him she doesn't sleep with Lee. He rebuffs her, despite a powerful attraction, because he sees her and Lee as a surrogate family. On January 15, 1947, the hideously mutilated body of Elizabeth Short, or the \\"Black Dahlia\\", is found in an abandoned lot and becomes a media sensation. Lee is especially disturbed by the case; Bleichert learns Lee's beloved sister Laurie vanished without a trace years earlier. For his part, Bucky develops a strange obsession with Short, identifying with her troubled, nomadic, and marginal life. As he investigates the murder, Bucky encounters Madeleine Sprague, a spoiled socialite who greatly resembles Short and had a one-time sexual encounter with her. In exchange with keeping her name out of the papers, Madeleine plies Bucky with sex, causing him to fantasize that Madeline is Short. Bucky meets her family, which endures constant abuse from her father Emmett, a property developer. Digging into the seedy underworld of Los Angeles, Bucky finds a film of Short and uncovers a familial web of police corruption peripherally tied to her murder. One person commits suicide, and an officer who solicited kinky sex from Short is convicted. In the midst of this, Bucky gives up Madeleine and commits to Kay. As he continues his investigation, he hears contradictory descriptions about Short, learning that she had been raped as a teenager, was rescued by some servicemen, learned she was infertile, and became promiscuous with servicemen as she thought of them as her saviors. Meanwhile, Lee disappears, seemingly having travelled to Tijuana, Mexico. As he searches Tijuana, Bucky learns that Lee has been murdered. After he tells Kay, she tells him the truth about Lee: he masterminded the robbery for which Kay's ex-boyfriend was convicted, framing him and keeping the money. Lee was being blackmailed by the only other survivor from the robbery, who was killed in the gunfight. Bucky is horrified, but forgives Lee. Bucky eventually marries Kay, but their marriage deteriorates. He is eventually transferred to the nascent forensics division, where he performs routine work on a wealthy suicide who lived a block away from Madeleine. Digging deeper, Bucky learns from a wealthy socialite that Madeleine's mother Ramona and family friend Georgie had the kids engage in gory reenactments of World War I trench warfare on the front lawn. Bucky sees a painting of a clown with garish makeup that resembles a Glasgow smile, similar to Short's facial mutilations. His obsession piqued again, he follows Madeleine around at night. She has made herself up like Short, and begins to pick up strange servicemen for one-night stands. She and Bucky rekindle their affair, causing Kay to leave. Meanwhile, as the city tears down the last four letters of the \\"Hollywoodland\\" sign, a hut is discovered with walls covered in dried blood. They call in Bucky, who realizes that the hut, owned by Emmett Sprague, is where Georgie lived and had murdered Short. Bucky confronts Madeleine and Emmett, who he finds incestuously entwined on a bed. Bucky lays out the sequence of events: Madeline is the daughter of Georgie, who had a morbid fascination with dead things since his return from the war; Lee deduced he killed Short, but used the information to blackmail Emmett for $100,000, which led to his trip to Tijuana and his subsequent murder by Madeleine. Bucky kills Georgie for some measure of justice, but knows that turning in the rest of the family would blow back on him for suppressing evidence. He gradually realizes that every member of the Sprague family were accomplices in some way, as well as Kay, who picked up the $100,000 for Lee. Bucky is removed from the force while Madeleine is declared mentally ill and institutionalized. Emmett and Ramona Sprague escape punishment. The novel ends with possible hope for Bucky's future as he and Kay reconcile and have a baby in Boston, Massachusetts, Short's birthplace. Reception The Black Dahlia was one of numerous neo-noir novels published in the late 1970s and 1980s. Ellroy was known as an author of crime fiction but this novel is considered to have gained him critical notice as a serious writer of literature. Ellroy wrote three other novels in what he termed the L.A. Quartet, a cycle of novels set in 1940s and 1950s Los Angeles. He portrays the city in this period as a hotbed of political corruption and depravity. The Quartet continues with The Big Nowhere, L.A. Confidential, and White Jazz. Film adaptation The Black Dahlia was adapted for a 2006 film of the same name by director Brian De Palma. Starring Scarlett Johansson, Josh Hartnett and Aaron Eckhart, it was a critical and commercial failure, with the consensus being that it had been poorly made and acted. It was criticized as sometimes appearing incoherent . The latter fault may have been caused by De Palma's drastic editing of the finished product, which initially ran for three hours and he eventually cut down to two. Graphic novel In 2013, Matz and David Fincher adapted James Ellroy's novel into a comic called Le Dahlia noir, with Miles Hyman (https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Hyman) as the illustrator. Originally published in French, it was published in English in 2016 as The Black Dahlia: A Crime Graphic Novel. Anachronisms The Black Dahlia has several references to characters having been committed to Atascadero State Hospital, but this institution did not open until 1954. The character Madeleine is committed there (ch. 3-5), but the hospital's patient population was historically limited to men. Madeleine tells her father she and Bucky met at an art show at Stanley Rose's bookstore. However, that store closed permanently eight years prior in 1939.

The character originally appeared in Nutty as the back page strip in Issue 1, dated 16 February 1980 drawn by John Geering. He has since appeared in The Dandy and The Beano. Original strip The original strip, by Dave Donaldson and Steve Bright, written and developed by the latter, and mostly drawn by John Geering until his death in 1999, is essentially a parody of Superman and Batman with elements of Captain Marvel and his British twin, Marvelman, and occasionally other Silver Age characters, while also combining comic slapstick with a heavy dose of eccentric British humour similar to Alan Moore's contemporary work on Captain Britain. After John Geering died in 1999, Barrie Appleby took over and later Tom Paterson. In 2003, the original scriptwriter, Steve Bright drew it, until 2007. Sporadically from 2007 to 2010 the character appeared in reprinted strips from the John Geering era. For a short time, in the end of 2008, artist Chris McGhie reinvented Bananaman in a series of new strips. McGhie's other work included The Three Bears for The Beano (in 2002) and the characters on Yoplait's 'Wildlife' product range. Two new strips drawn by Barrie Appleby appeared that year as well. Following the Dandy revamp of October 2010, Wayne Thompson took over drawing Bananaman in a style reminiscent of French cartoonist Lisa Mandel, a popular artist in The Dandy who had previously drawn Jak, Agent Dog 2-Zero and, occasionally, Bully Beef and Chips. In Issue 3515, Thompson's style changed notably, becoming more cartoonish and detailed. As of spring 2011, Thompson's version of Bananaman appears in full colour over two pages. From 1983 to 1986, Bananaman also had his own annual. This was unusual because, unlike many other comics at the time, Nutty never had an annual. Unlike Dennis the Menace and Bash Street Kids, which mostly consisted of reprints, all the material in these annuals was new. In Issue 3618, dated 14 January 2012, Bananaman made his debut appearance, as John Geering reprints, in The Beano, however he continued to appear in The Dandy. Another Beano character, Bananagirl of Super School, was revealed to be his cousin. The Dandy print comic ended in December 2012, but Bananaman was still seen in the digital version drawn by Andy Janes. New Bananaman strips drawn by Wayne Thompson and written by Nigel Auchterlounie, Kev F Sutherland and lately Cavan Scott continue to run in The Beano through 2014. In 2016, writing duties for the strip were taken over by Tommy Donbavand and Danny Pearson, since 2018, Bananaman has been written by Ned Hartley. Character In the strip, Eric Wimp, an ordinary schoolboy living at 29 Acacia Road, Nuttytown (later changed to Dandytown and then Beanotown when the strip moved to other comics), eats a banana to transform into Bananaman, an adult superhero, sporting a distinctive cowled blue and yellow outfit complete with a yellow two tailed cape resembling a banana skin. His superpowers include the ability to fly, superhuman strength (often quoted as \\"twenty men... twenty big men\\" but sometimes limitless, with \\"nerks\\", \\"women\\" and \\"snowmen\\" all being used in place of \\"men\\"), and seeming invulnerability. This is offset by the fact that he is just as naive and foolish (if not more so) as his alter ego; as mentioned in the comic once or twice, he has the \\"muscles of twenty men and the brains of twenty mussels\\". If Bananaman needs extra power, bananas can be eaten for strength boosts, provided by his faithful pet crow; if he does not have enough strength to shatter an ice block, for example, after eating another banana, he will have enough. If he eats many bananas in one sitting, he quickly becomes obese in his transformation; if he eats bananas that are not full, he transforms with extra weight in the lower part of his body. There have also been comics where he has eaten a variant on normal bananas, and transforms differently, reflecting the difference in that banana. The effects of eating the bananas are not consistent from story to story. In one Beano issue with Eric unable to find a banana, he resorted to drinking banana milk, becoming a liquid, totally useless version of Bananaman who later in the story is mopped up by a janitor. Varying origins Eric Wimp was rocketed to Earth from the moon as a baby, and gained his powers because the crescent moon resembles a banana. Bananaman resembles Superman in having a kryptonite style weakness to mouldy bananas, and a Fortress of Solitude style building at the North Pole, made out of a giant banana. During early board meetings, the designers thought of having Bananagirl accompany the series. The girl would have been called Margaret Wimp, and be the \\"sister\\" of Eric. This idea was scrapped later on in production, because the concept of two children being related without parents would be too far fetched for children to understand; however, the idea was revived for a Beano comic strip. In the 1991 Dandy Annual, Bananaman's origin was changed to that of being a normal Earth baby in a maternity hospital, who obtained his powers after unintentionally eating a banana in which General Blight had hidden a stolen supply of 'Saturnium', and accidentally left it next to Eric. However, later issues referred to the first origin as the real one. Other characters Bananaman initially faced a different pastiche supervillain each week, who were often lampoons of the kind of single issue, uncreatively named villains that heroes fought during the Silver Age, or tips of the hat to famous supervillains. Bananaman's arch enemy is General Blight, a parody of Adolf Hitler and generic criminal mastermind who in later strips largely replaced the criminal of the week. Other villains included mad scientist Doctor Gloom, Bananaman's evil fruit counterpart Appleman, the mischief making Weatherman and dessert fiend Captain Cream. Eric's punk style shaved head was replaced by a more typical 1980s style haircut, Bananaman gained a talking crow sidekick called simply Crow,, and Bananaman became so stupid he often forgot how to fly or to use the door. Eventually, Bananaman even began to go to school despite being an adult. Bananaman is allied with Chief O'Reilly, a stereotyped Irish policeman (apparently in homage to Batman's James Gordon or the equally stereotyped Chief O'Hara in the 1960s Batman television series). He used to wear an Indian feather headdress as a visual pun on Chief, and in later strips wore a hat with a flashing blue light on the top. Chief works in a police station shaped like a giant police helmet, which frequently has to be rebuilt after Bananaman accidentally destroys it. O'Reilly rings up Eric to get him to talk to Bananaman, presumably thinking Eric is Bananaman's assistant of some kind, as in the cartoon series it is made clear that the Chief is not aware of Eric's being the superhero. Television cartoon series From 1983 to 1986, the BBC aired a cartoon series based on Bananaman and featuring the voices of the members of The Goodies. It was produced by 101 Productions. Parts of the character were changed for the series: he was now called Eric Twinge, had a distinctive banana shaped hairstyle rather than punk stubble, and had a love interest (only when transformed) in the form of Fiona, a newsreader based on Selina Scott and also a possible homage to Lois Lane. Graeme Garden (incorrectly credited as Greame Garden on some episodes) voiced the characters of Bananaman, General Blight and Maurice of The Heavy Mob, Bill Oddie voiced the characters of Crow, Chief O'Reilly, Doctor Gloom and the Weatherman, and Tim Brooke-Taylor voiced the characters of Eric, King Zorg of the Nerks, Eddie the Gent, Auntie, and Appleman, as well as narrating the episodes. Jill Shilling voiced Fiona and any additional female characters, including Eric's cousin Samantha (but not Auntie). The programme lasted for forty episodes between 3 October 1983 and 15 April 1986. Bananaman was aired in the United States by the Nickelodeon cable network, as a companion piece to Danger Mouse, but Bananaman never came close to reaching that series' American popularity. The show also aired during the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's (ABC) after school timeslot, and is considered one of the Classic ABC shows. In 1997, some episodes of Bananaman were used on the cartoon series The Pepe and Paco Show, created by Henson International Television. Some of these episodes would eventually reappear in print form in The Dandy in 1998, coinciding with the BBC repeating the series that year, and were reprinted in the comic in the spring of 2007, now promoting the DVD. Each episode was roughly five minutes from start to end. Phrases from the show, \\"twenty big men\\" and \\"ever alert for the call to action\\", are still used in the comic today. Film adaptation In March 2014, it was announced that DC Thomson, in conjunction with Elstree Studio Productions, would be producing a movie on Bananaman, with a release date in 2015. In May 2014, DC Thomson unveiled the first teaser poster for the film. By September 2015, the official website stated \\"coming soon\\" instead of 2015. In September 2015, it was announced that the movie was in the early stages. In January 2016, the Bananaman musical's page on Facebook posted that the movie adaptation is now in development, saying \\"This fruitiest of superheroes is experiencing a revival elsewhere ‚Äì Bananaman The Movie is also in development\\". However, a release date was not mentioned. On 8 June 2016, the now newly formed Beano Studios issued a press release. In the release it was noted that Beano Studios was formed to bring their properties to life through television, film and live performances based upon present projects which were being worked on. \\"Beano Studios is currently also exploring plans to take Beano characters to the bigger screens and stages worldwide.\\" Though not specifically referenced, it can be assumed that this newly formed studio would take charge of the Bananaman movie, which had had no developments since the beginning of 2016. By June 2017, the official site had been removed. As the film never came in 2015 as promised, it is likely the film has been cancelled. Musical production Near the beginning of January 2016, it was reported that Bananaman would be turned into a musical for West End. An industry launch took place on 2 February 2016, showcasing the musical. The musical had a run from the end of 2017 to the beginning of 2018, at the Southwark Playhouse in London. It is unknown if it will be produced worldwide.

An example is the orthogonal group, defined by the relation M^TM = 1 where M^T is the transpose of M. Many Lie groups can be viewed as linear algebraic groups over the field of real or complex numbers. (For example, every compact Lie group can be regarded as a linear algebraic group over R (necessarily R-anisotropic and reductive), as can many noncompact groups such as the simple Lie group SL(n,R).) The simple Lie groups were classified by Wilhelm Killing and √âlie Cartan in the 1880s and 1890s. At that time, no special use was made of the fact that the group structure can be defined by polynomials, that is, that these are algebraic groups. The founders of the theory of algebraic groups include Maurer, Chevalley, and . In the 1950s, Armand Borel constructed much of the theory of algebraic groups as it exists today. One of the first uses for the theory was to define the Chevalley groups. Examples For a positive integer n, the general linear group GL(n) over a field k, consisting of all invertible n\\\\times n matrices, is a linear algebraic group over k. It contains the subgroups :U \\\\subset B \\\\subset GL(n) consisting of matrices of the form :\\\\left ( \\\\begin{array}{cccc} 1 & * & \\\\dots & * \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots & * \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\dots & 0 & 1\\\\end{array} \\\\right ) and \\\\left ( \\\\begin{array}{cccc} * & * & \\\\dots & * \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & * & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots & * \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\dots & 0 & *\\\\end{array} \\\\right ). The group U is an example of a unipotent linear algebraic group, the group B is an example of a solvable algebraic group called the Borel subgroup of GL(n). It is a consequence of the Lie-Kolchin theorem that any connected solvable subgroup of \\\\mathrm{GL}(n) is conjugated into B. Any unipotent subgroup can be conjugated into U. Another algebraic subgroup of \\\\mathrm{GL}(n) is the special linear group \\\\mathrm{SL}(n) of matrices with determinant 1. The group GL(1) is called the multiplicative group, usually denoted by \\\\mathbf G_{\\\\mathrm m}. The group of k-points \\\\mathbf G_{\\\\mathrm m}(k) is the multiplicative group k^* of nonzero elements of the field k. The additive group \\\\mathbf G_{\\\\mathrm a}, whose k-points are isomorphic to the additive group of k, can also be expressed as a matrix group, for example as the subgroup U in \\\\mathrm{GL}(2) : :\\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & * \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\end{pmatrix}. These two basic examples of commutative linear algebraic groups, the multiplicative and additive groups, behave very differently in terms of their linear representations (as algebraic groups). Every representation of the multiplicative group \\\\mathbf G_{\\\\mathrm m} is a direct sum of irreducible representations. (Its irreducible representations all have dimension 1, of the form x \\\\mapsto x^n for an integer n.) By contrast, the only irreducible representation of the additive group \\\\mathbf G_{\\\\mathrm a} is the trivial representation. So every representation of \\\\mathbf G_{\\\\mathrm a} (such as the 2-dimensional representation above) is an iterated extension of trivial representations, not a direct sum (unless the representation is trivial). The structure theory of linear algebraic groups analyzes any linear algebraic group in terms of these two basic groups and their generalizations, tori and unipotent groups, as discussed below. Definitions For an algebraically closed field k, much of the structure of an algebraic variety X over k is encoded in its set X(k) of k-rational points, which allows an elementary definition of a linear algebraic group. First, define a function from the abstract group GL(n,k) to k to be regular if it can be written as a polynomial in the entries of an n√ón matrix A and in 1/det(A), where det is the determinant. Then a linear algebraic group G over an algebraically closed field k is a subgroup G(k) of the abstract group GL(n,k) for some natural number n such that G(k) is defined by the vanishing of some set of regular functions. For an arbitrary field k, algebraic varieties over k are defined as a special case of schemes over k. In that language, a linear algebraic group G over a field k is a smooth closed subgroup scheme of GL(n) over k for some natural number n. In particular, G is defined by the vanishing of some set of regular functions on GL(n) over k, and these functions must have the property that for every commutative k-algebra R, G(R) is a subgroup of the abstract group GL(n,R). (Thus an algebraic group G over k is not just the abstract group G(k), but rather the whole family of groups G(R) for commutative k-algebras R; this is the philosophy of describing a scheme by its functor of points.) In either language, one has the notion of a homomorphism of linear algebraic groups. For example, when k is algebraically closed, a homomorphism from G ‚äÇ GL(m) to H ‚äÇ GL(n) is a homomorphism of abstract groups G(k) ‚Üí H(k) which is defined by regular functions on G. This makes the linear algebraic groups over k into a category. In particular, this defines what it means for two linear algebraic groups to be isomorphic. In the language of schemes, a linear algebraic group G over a field k is in particular a group scheme over k, meaning a scheme over k together with a k-point 1 ‚àà G(k) and morphisms :m\\\\colon G \\\\times_k G \\\\to G, \\\\; i\\\\colon G \\\\to G over k which satisfy the usual axioms for the multiplication and inverse maps in a group (associativity, identity, inverses). A linear algebraic group is also smooth and of finite type over k, and it is affine (as a scheme). Conversely, every affine group scheme G of finite type over a field k has a faithful representation into GL(n) over k for some n.Milne (2017), Corollary 4.10. An example is the embedding of the additive group Ga into GL(2), as mentioned above. As a result, one can think of linear algebraic groups either as matrix groups or, more abstractly, as smooth affine group schemes over a field. (Some authors use \\"linear algebraic group\\" to mean any affine group scheme of finite type over a field.) For a full understanding of linear algebraic groups, one has to consider more general (non-smooth) group schemes. For example, let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic p > 0. Then the homomorphism f: Gm ‚Üí Gm defined by x ‚Ü¶ xp induces an isomorphism of abstract groups k* ‚Üí k*, but f is not an isomorphism of algebraic groups (because x1/p is not a regular function). In the language of group schemes, there is a clearer reason why f is not an isomorphism: f is surjective, but it has nontrivial kernel, namely the group scheme Œºp of pth roots of unity. This issue does not arise in characteristic zero. Indeed, every group scheme of finite type over a field k of characteristic zero is smooth over k.Milne (2017), Corollary 8.39. A group scheme of finite type over any field k is smooth over k if and only if it is geometrically reduced, meaning that the base change G_{\\\\overline k} is reduced, where \\\\overline k is an algebraic closure of k.Milne (2017), Proposition 1.26(b). Since an affine scheme X is determined by its ring O(X) of regular functions, an affine group scheme G over a field k is determined by the ring O(G) with its structure of a Hopf algebra (coming from the multiplication and inverse maps on G). This gives an equivalence of categories (reversing arrows) between affine group schemes over k and commutative Hopf algebras over k. For example, the Hopf algebra corresponding to the multiplicative group Gm = GL(1) is the Laurent polynomial ring k[x, x‚àí1], with comultiplication given by :x \\\\mapsto x \\\\otimes x. =Basic notions= For a linear algebraic group G over a field k, the identity component Go (the connected component containing the point 1) is a normal subgroup of finite index. So there is a group extension :1 \\\\to G^\\\\circ \\\\to G \\\\to F \\\\to 1, where F is a finite algebraic group. (For k algebraically closed, F can be identified with an abstract finite group.) Because of this, the study of algebraic groups mostly focuses on connected groups. Various notions from abstract group theory can be extended to linear algebraic groups. It is straightforward to define what it means for a linear algebraic group to be commutative, nilpotent, or solvable, by analogy with the definitions in abstract group theory. For example, a linear algebraic group is solvable if it has a composition series of linear algebraic subgroups such that the quotient groups are commutative. Also, the normalizer, the center, and the centralizer of a closed subgroup H of a linear algebraic group G are naturally viewed as closed subgroup schemes of G. If they are smooth over k, then they are linear algebraic groups as defined above. One may ask to what extent the properties of a connected linear algebraic group G over a field k are determined by the abstract group G(k). A useful result in this direction is that if the field k is perfect (for example, of characteristic zero), or if G is reductive (as defined below), then G is unirational over k. Therefore, if in addition k is infinite, the group G(k) is Zariski dense in G.Borel (1991), Theorem 18.2 and Corollary 18.4. For example, under the assumptions mentioned, G is commutative, nilpotent, or solvable if and only if G(k) has the corresponding property. The assumption of connectedness cannot be omitted in these results. For example, let G be the group Œº3 ‚äÇ GL(1) of cube roots of unity over the rational numbers Q. Then G is a linear algebraic group over Q for which G(Q) = 1 is not Zariski dense in G, because G(\\\\overline {\\\\mathbf Q}) is a group of order 3. Over an algebraically closed field, there is a stronger result about algebraic groups as algebraic varieties: every connected linear algebraic group over an algebraically closed field is a rational variety.Borel (1991), Remark 14.14. The Lie algebra of an algebraic group The Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak g of an algebraic group G can be defined in several equivalent ways: as the tangent space T1(G) at the identity element 1 ‚àà G(k), or as the space of left-invariant derivations. If k is algebraically closed, a derivation D: O(G) ‚Üí O(G) over k of the coordinate ring of G is left-invariant if :D \\\\lambda_x = \\\\lambda_x D for every x in G(k), where Œªx: O(G) ‚Üí O(G) is induced by left multiplication by x. For an arbitrary field k, left invariance of a derivation is defined as an analogous equality of two linear maps O(G) ‚Üí O(G) ‚äóO(G).Milne (2017), section 10.e. The Lie bracket of two derivations is defined by [D1, D2] =D1D2 ‚àí D2D1. The passage from G to \\\\mathfrak g is thus a process of differentiation. For an element x ‚àà G(k), the derivative at 1 ‚àà G(k) of the conjugation map G ‚Üí G, g ‚Ü¶ xgx‚àí1, is an automorphism of \\\\mathfrak g, giving the adjoint representation: :\\\\operatorname{Ad}\\\\colon G \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Aut}(\\\\mathfrak g). Over a field of characteristic zero, a connected subgroup H of a linear algebraic group G is uniquely determined by its Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak h \\\\subset \\\\mathfrak g.Borel (1991), section 7.1. But not every Lie subalgebra of \\\\mathfrak g corresponds to an algebraic subgroup of G, as one sees in the example of the torus G = (Gm)2 over C. In positive characteristic, there can be many different connected subgroups of a group G with the same Lie algebra (again, the torus G = (Gm)2 provides examples). For these reasons, although the Lie algebra of an algebraic group is important, the structure theory of algebraic groups requires more global tools. Semisimple and unipotent elements For an algebraically closed field k, a matrix g in GL(n,k) is called semisimple if it is diagonalizable, and unipotent if the matrix g ‚àí 1 is nilpotent. Equivalently, g is unipotent if all eigenvalues of g are equal to 1. The Jordan canonical form for matrices implies that every element g of GL(n,k) can be written uniquely as a product g = gssgu such that gss is semisimple, gu is unipotent, and gss and gu commute with each other. For any field k, an element g of GL(n,k) is said to be semisimple if it becomes diagonalizable over the algebraic closure of k. If the field k is perfect, then the semisimple and unipotent parts of g also lie in GL(n,k). Finally, for any linear algebraic group G ‚äÇ GL(n) over a field k, define a k-point of G to be semisimple or unipotent if it is semisimple or unipotent in GL(n,k). (These properties are in fact independent of the choice of a faithful representation of G.) If the field k is perfect, then the semisimple and unipotent parts of a k-point of G are automatically in G. That is (the Jordan decomposition): every element g of G(k) can be written uniquely as a product g = gssgu in G(k) such that gss is semisimple, gu is unipotent, and gss and gu commute with each other.Milne (2017), Theorem 9.18. This reduces the problem of describing the conjugacy classes in G(k) to the semisimple and unipotent cases. Tori A torus over an algebraically closed field k means a group isomorphic to (Gm)n, the product of n copies of the multiplicative group over k, for some natural number n. For a linear algebraic group G, a maximal torus in G means a torus in G that is not contained in any bigger torus. For example, the group of diagonal matrices in GL(n) over k is a maximal torus in GL(n), isomorphic to (Gm)n. A basic result of the theory is that any two maximal tori in a group G over an algebraically closed field k are conjugate by some element of G(k).Borel (1991), Corollary 11.3. The rank of G means the dimension of any maximal torus. For an arbitrary field k, a torus T over k means a linear algebraic group over k whose base change T_{\\\\overline k} to the algebraic closure of k is isomorphic to (Gm)n over \\\\overline k, for some natural number n. A split torus over k means a group isomorphic to (Gm)n over k for some n. An example of a non-split torus over the real numbers R is :T=\\\\\\\\{(x,y)\\\\in A^2_{\\\\mathbf{R}}: x^2+y^2=1\\\\\\\\}, with group structure given by the formula for multiplying complex numbers x+iy. Here T is a torus of dimension 1 over R. It is not split, because its group of real points T(R) is the circle group, which is not isomorphic even as an abstract group to Gm(R) = R*. Every point of a torus over a field k is semisimple. Conversely, if G is a connected linear algebraic group such that every element of G(\\\\overline k) is semisimple, then G is a torus.Milne (2017), Corollary 17.25 For a linear algebraic group G over a general field k, one cannot expect all maximal tori in G over k to be conjugate by elements of G(k). For example, both the multiplicative group Gm and the circle group T above occur as maximal tori in SL(2) over R. However, it is always true that any two maximal split tori in G over k (meaning split tori in G that are not contained in a bigger split torus) are conjugate by some element of G(k).Springer (1998), Theorem 15.2.6. As a result, it makes sense to define the k-rank or split rank of a group G over k as the dimension of any maximal split torus in G over k. For any maximal torus T in a linear algebraic group G over a field k, Grothendieck showed that T_{\\\\overline k} is a maximal torus in G_{\\\\overline k}.Borel (1991), 18.2(i). It follows that any two maximal tori in G over a field k have the same dimension, although they need not be isomorphic. Unipotent groups Let Un be the group of upper-triangular matrices in GL(n) with diagonal entries equal to 1, over a field k. A group scheme over a field k (for example, a linear algebraic group) is called unipotent if it is isomorphic to a closed subgroup scheme of Un for some n. It is straightforward to check that the group Un is nilpotent. As a result, every unipotent group scheme is nilpotent. A linear algebraic group G over a field k is unipotent if and only if every element of G(\\\\overline{k}) is unipotent.Milne (2017), Corollary 14.12. The group Bn of upper-triangular matrices in GL(n) is a semidirect product :B_n = T_n \\\\ltimes U_n, where Tn is the diagonal torus (Gm)n. More generally, every connected solvable linear algebraic group is a semidirect product of a torus with a unipotent group, T ‚ãâ U.Borel (1991), Theorem 10.6. A smooth connected unipotent group over a perfect field k (for example, an algebraically closed field) has a composition series with all quotient groups isomorphic to the additive group Ga.Borel (1991), Theorem 15.4(iii). Borel subgroups The Borel subgroups are important for the structure theory of linear algebraic groups. For a linear algebraic group G over an algebraically closed field k, a Borel subgroup of G means a maximal smooth connected solvable subgroup. For example, one Borel subgroup of GL(n) is the subgroup B of upper-triangular matrices (all entries below the diagonal are zero). A basic result of the theory is that any two Borel subgroups of a connected group G over an algebraically closed field k are conjugate by some element of G(k).Borel (1991), Theorem 11.1. (A standard proof uses the Borel fixed-point theorem: for a connected solvable group G acting on a proper variety X over an algebraically closed field k, there is a k-point in X which is fixed by the action of G.) The conjugacy of Borel subgroups in GL(n) amounts to the Lie‚ÄìKolchin theorem: every smooth connected solvable subgroup of GL(n) is conjugate to a subgroup of the upper-triangular subgroup in GL(n). For an arbitrary field k, a Borel subgroup B of G is defined to be a subgroup over k such that, over an algebraic closure \\\\overline k of k, B_{\\\\overline k}is a Borel subgroup of G_{\\\\overline k}. Thus G may or may not have a Borel subgroup over k. For a closed subgroup scheme H of G, the quotient space G/H is a smooth quasi-projective scheme over k.Milne (2017), Theorems 7.18 and 8.43. A smooth subgroup P of a connected group G is called parabolic if G/P is projective over k (or equivalently, proper over k). An important property of Borel subgroups B is that G/B is a projective variety, called the flag variety of G. That is, Borel subgroups are parabolic subgroups. More precisely, for k algebraically closed, the Borel subgroups are exactly the minimal parabolic subgroups of G; conversely, every subgroup containing a Borel subgroup is parabolic.Borel (1991), Corollary 11.2. So one can list all parabolic subgroups of G (up to conjugation by G(k)) by listing all the linear algebraic subgroups of G that contain a fixed Borel subgroup. For example, the subgroups P ‚äÇ GL(3) over k that contain the Borel subgroup B of upper-triangular matrices are B itself, the whole group GL(3), and the intermediate subgroups :\\\\left \\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{bmatrix} * & * & * \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & * & * \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & * & * \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\right \\\\\\\\} and \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{bmatrix} * & * & * \\\\\\\\\\\\ * & * & * \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & * \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\right \\\\\\\\}. The corresponding projective homogeneous varieties GL(3)/P are (respectively): the flag manifold of all chains of linear subspaces :0\\\\subset V_1\\\\subset V_2\\\\subset A^3_k with Vi of dimension i; a point; the projective space P2 of lines (1-dimensional linear subspaces) in A3; and the dual projective space P2 of planes in A3. Semisimple and reductive groups A connected linear algebraic group G over an algebraically closed field is called semisimple if every smooth connected solvable normal subgroup of G is trivial. More generally, a connected linear algebraic group G over an algebraically closed field is called reductive if every smooth connected unipotent normal subgroup of G is trivial.Milne (2017), Definition 6.46. (Some authors do not require reductive groups to be connected.) A semisimple group is reductive. A group G over an arbitrary field k is called semisimple or reductive if G_{\\\\overline k} is semisimple or reductive. For example, the group SL(n) of n √ó n matrices with determinant 1 over any field k is semisimple, whereas a nontrivial torus is reductive but not semisimple. Likewise, GL(n) is reductive but not semisimple (because its center Gm is a nontrivial smooth connected solvable normal subgroup). Every compact connected Lie group has a complexification, which is a complex reductive algebraic group. In fact, this construction gives a one-to-one correspondence between compact connected Lie groups and complex reductive groups, up to isomorphism.Br√∂cker & tom Dieck (1985), section III.8; Conrad (2014), section D.3. A linear algebraic group G over a field k is called simple (or k-simple) if it is semisimple, nontrivial, and every smooth connected normal subgroup of G over k is trivial or equal to G.Conrad (2014), after Proposition 5.1.17. (Some authors call this property \\"almost simple\\".) This differs slightly from the terminology for abstract groups, in that a simple algebraic group may have nontrivial center (although the center must be finite). For example, for any integer n at least 2 and any field k, the group SL(n) over k is simple, and its center is the group scheme Œºn of nth roots of unity. Every connected linear algebraic group G over a perfect field k is (in a unique way) an extension of a reductive group R by a smooth connected unipotent group U, called the unipotent radical of G: :1\\\\to U\\\\to G\\\\to R\\\\to 1. If k has characteristic zero, then one has the more precise Levi decomposition: every connected linear algebraic group G over k is a semidirect product R\\\\ltimes U of a reductive group by a unipotent group.Conrad (2014), Proposition 5.4.1. Classification of reductive groups Reductive groups include the most important linear algebraic groups in practice, such as the classical groups: GL(n), SL(n), the orthogonal groups SO(n) and the symplectic groups Sp(2n). On the other hand, the definition of reductive groups is quite \\"negative\\", and it is not clear that one can expect to say much about them. Remarkably, Claude Chevalley gave a complete classification of the reductive groups over an algebraically closed field: they are determined by root data.Springer (1998), 9.6.2 and 10.1.1. In particular, simple groups over an algebraically closed field k are classified (up to quotients by finite central subgroup schemes) by their Dynkin diagrams. It is striking that this classification is independent of the characteristic of k. For example, the exceptional Lie groups G2, F4, E6, E7, and E8 can be defined in any characteristic (and even as group schemes over Z). The classification of finite simple groups says that most finite simple groups arise as the group of k-points of a simple algebraic group over a finite field k, or as minor variants of that construction. Every reductive group over a field is the quotient by a finite central subgroup scheme of the product of a torus and some simple groups. For example, :GL(n)\\\\cong (G_m\\\\times SL(n))/\\\\mu_n. For an arbitrary field k, a reductive group G is called split if it contains a split maximal torus over k (that is, a split torus in G which remains maximal over an algebraic closure of k). For example, GL(n) is a split reductive group over any field k. Chevalley showed that the classification of split reductive groups is the same over any field. By contrast, the classification of arbitrary reductive groups can be hard, depending on the base field. For example, every nondegenerate quadratic form q over a field k determines a reductive group SO(q), and every central simple algebra A over k determines a reductive group SL1(A). As a result, the problem of classifying reductive groups over k essentially includes the problem of classifying all quadratic forms over k or all central simple algebras over k. These problems are easy for k algebraically closed, and they are understood for some other fields such as number fields, but for arbitrary fields there are many open questions. Applications =Representation theory= One reason for the importance of reductive groups comes from representation theory. Every irreducible representation of a unipotent group is trivial. More generally, for any linear algebraic group G written as an extension :1\\\\to U\\\\to G\\\\to R\\\\to 1 with U unipotent and R reductive, every irreducible representation of G factors through R.Milne (2017), Lemma 19.16. This focuses attention on the representation theory of reductive groups. (To be clear, the representations considered here are representations of G as an algebraic group. Thus, for a group G over a field k, the representations are on k-vector spaces, and the action of G is given by regular functions. It is an important but different problem to classify continuous representations of the group G(R) for a real reductive group G, or similar problems over other fields.) Chevalley showed that the irreducible representations of a split reductive group over a field k are finite-dimensional, and they are indexed by dominant weights.Milne (2017), Theorem 22.2. This is the same as what happens in the representation theory of compact connected Lie groups, or the finite-dimensional representation theory of complex semisimple Lie algebras. For k of characteristic zero, all these theories are essentially equivalent. In particular, every representation of a reductive group G over a field of characteristic zero is a direct sum of irreducible representations, and if G is split, the characters of the irreducible representations are given by the Weyl character formula. The Borel‚ÄìWeil theorem gives a geometric construction of the irreducible representations of a reductive group G in characteristic zero, as spaces of sections of line bundles over the flag manifold G/B. The representation theory of reductive groups (other than tori) over a field of positive characteristic p is less well understood. In this situation, a representation need not be a direct sum of irreducible representations. And although irreducible representations are indexed by dominant weights, the dimensions and characters of the irreducible representations are known only in some cases. determined these characters (proving Lusztig's conjecture) when the characteristic p is sufficiently large compared to the Coxeter number of the group. For small primes p, there is not even a precise conjecture. =Group actions and geometric invariant theory= An action of a linear algebraic group G on a variety (or scheme) X over a field k is a morphism :G \\\\times_k X \\\\to X that satisfies the axioms of a group action. As in other types of group theory, it is important to study group actions, since groups arise naturally as symmetries of geometric objects. Part of the theory of group actions is geometric invariant theory, which aims to construct a quotient variety X/G, describing the set of orbits of a linear algebraic group G on X as an algebraic variety. Various complications arise. For example, if X is an affine variety, then one can try to construct X/G as Spec of the ring of invariants O(X)G. However, Masayoshi Nagata showed that the ring of invariants need not be finitely generated as a k-algebra (and so Spec of the ring is a scheme but not a variety), a negative answer to Hilbert's 14th problem. In the positive direction, the ring of invariants is finitely generated if G is reductive, by Haboush's theorem, proved in characteristic zero by Hilbert and Nagata. Geometric invariant theory involves further subtleties when a reductive group G acts on a projective variety X. In particular, the theory defines open subsets of \\"stable\\" and \\"semistable\\" points in X, with the quotient morphism only defined on the set of semistable points. Related notions Linear algebraic groups admit variants in several directions. Dropping the existence of the inverse map i\\\\colon G \\\\to G, one obtains the notion of a linear algebraic monoid.. =Lie groups= For a linear algebraic group G over the real numbers R, the group of real points G(R) is a Lie group, essentially because real polynomials, which describe the multiplication on G, are smooth functions. Likewise, for a linear algebraic group G over C, G(C) is a complex Lie group. Much of the theory of algebraic groups was developed by analogy with Lie groups. There are several reasons why a Lie group may not have the structure of a linear algebraic group over R. *A Lie group with an infinite group of components G/Go cannot be realized as a linear algebraic group. *An algebraic group G over R may be connected as an algebraic group while the Lie group G(R) is not connected, and likewise for simply connected groups. For example, the algebraic group SL(2) is simply connected over any field, whereas the Lie group SL(2,R) has fundamental group isomorphic to the integers Z. The double cover H of SL(2,R), known as the metaplectic group, is a Lie group that cannot be viewed as a linear algebraic group over R. More strongly, H has no faithful finite-dimensional representation. *Anatoly Maltsev showed that every simply connected nilpotent Lie group can be viewed as a unipotent algebraic group G over R in a unique way.Milne (2017), Theorem 14.37. (As a variety, G is isomorphic to affine space of some dimension over R.) By contrast, there are simply connected solvable Lie groups that cannot be viewed as real algebraic groups. For example, the universal cover H of the semidirect product S1 ‚ãâ R2 has center isomorphic to Z, which is not a linear algebraic group, and so H cannot be viewed as a linear algebraic group over R. =Abelian varieties= Algebraic groups which are not affine behave very differently. In particular, a smooth connected group scheme which is a projective variety over a field is called an abelian variety. In contrast to linear algebraic groups, every abelian variety is commutative. Nonetheless, abelian varieties have a rich theory. Even the case of elliptic curves (abelian varieties of dimension 1) is central to number theory, with applications including the proof of Fermat's last theorem. =Tannakian categories= The finite-dimensional representations of an algebraic group G, together with the tensor product of representations, form a tannakian category RepG. In fact, tannakian categories with a \\"fiber functor\\" over a field are equivalent to affine group schemes. (Every affine group scheme over a field k is pro-algebraic in the sense that it is an inverse limit of affine group schemes of finite type over k.Deligne & Milne (1982), Corollary II.2.7.) For example, the Mumford‚ÄìTate group and the motivic Galois group are constructed using this formalism. Certain properties of a (pro-)algebraic group G can be read from its category of representations. For example, over a field of characteristic zero, RepG is a semisimple category if and only if the identity component of G is pro-reductive.Deligne & Milne (1982), Remark II.2.28.

The conditions are referred to as orphan diseases. The assignment of orphan status to a disease and to drugs developed to treat it is a matter of public policy in many countries and has yielded medical breakthroughs that might not otherwise have been achieved, due to the economics of drug research and development. In the U.S. and the EU, it is easier to gain marketing approval for an orphan drug. There may be other financial incentives, such as an extended period of exclusivity, during which the producer has sole rights to market the drug. All are intended to encourage development of drugs which would otherwise lack sufficient profit motive to attract corporate research budgets and personnel. Definition According to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), an orphan drug is defined as one \\"intended for the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a rare disease or condition, which is one that affects less than 200,000 persons in the United States.\\" In the European Union (EU), the European Medicines Agency (EMA) defined a drug as \\"orphan\\" if it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically and seriously debilitating condition affecting not more than 10,000 EU people. EMA also qualified an orphan drug that - without incentives - it would be unlikely that marketing the drug in the EU would generate sufficient benefit for the affected people and for the drug manufacturer to justify the investment. As of 2017, there was no official integration of the orphan drug programs between the FDA and EMA. Global statistics , there were 281 marketed orphan drugs and more than 400 orphan-designated drugs in clinical trials. More than 60% of orphan drugs were biologics. The U.S. dominated development of orphan drugs, with more than 300 in clinical trials, followed by Europe. Cancer treatment was the indication in more than 30% of orphan drug trials. * Number of orphan drugs in clinical trials: 600 * Number of orphan drugs in Phase-2 Trial: 231 * Number of orphan drugs in U.S. clinical trials: 350 in the pipeline from research until registration * Key Market: US (Sales more than US$40 billion) Effect on investment, sales and profit According to Thomson Reuters in their 2012 publication \\"The Economic Power of Orphan Drugs,\\" there has been increased investment in orphan drug research and development, partly due to the U. S. Orphan Drug Act of 1983 (ODA) and similar acts in other regions of the world driven by \\"high-profile philanthropic funding.\\" According to Drug Discovery Today, the years 2001 to 2011 were the \\"most productive period in the history of orphan drug development, in terms of average annual orphan drug designations and orphan drug approvals.\\" For the same decade the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of the orphan drugs was an \\"impressive 25.8%, compared to only 20.1% for a matched control group of non-orphan drugs.\\" By 2012, the market for orphan drugs was worth USD$637 million, compared with USD$638 million for a control group of non-orphan drugs. By 2012, According to a 2014 report, the orphan drug market has become increasingly lucrative for a number of reasons. The cost of clinical trials for orphan drugs is substantially lower than for other diseases because trial sizes are naturally much smaller than for more diseases with larger numbers of patients. Small clinical trials and minimal competition place orphan agents at an advantage in regulatory review. Tax incentives reduce the cost of development. On average the cost per patient for orphan drugs is \\"six times that of non-orphan drugs, a clear indication of their pricing power.\\" The cost of per-person outlays are large and are expected to increase with wider use of public subsidies. The 2014 Orphan Drug report stated that the percentage of orphan drug sales as part of all prescription drug sales had been increasing at rapid rate. The report projected a total of US$176 billion by 2020. Although orphan disease populations are the smallest, the cost of per-patient outlays among them are the largest and are expected to increase as more people with rare diseases become eligible for subsidies ‚Äî in the U.S., for example, through the Affordable Care Act. Legislation Orphan drugs generally follow the same regulatory development path as any other pharmaceutical product, in which testing focuses on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, dosing, stability, safety and efficacy. However, some statistical burdens are lessened to maintain development momentum. For example, orphan drug regulations generally acknowledge the fact that it may not be possible to test 1,000 patients in a phase III clinical trial if fewer than that number are afflicted with the disease. Government intervention on behalf of orphan drug development takes several forms: * Tax incentives * Exclusivity (enhanced patent protection and marketing rights) * Research subsidies * Creating a government-run enterprise to engage in research and development as in a Crown corporation A 2015 study of \\"34 key Canadian stakeholders, including drug regulators, funders, scientists, policy experts, pharmaceutical industry representatives, and patient advocates\\" investigated factors behind the pharmaceutical industry growing interest in \\"niche markets\\" such as orphan drugs. =United States= The Orphan Drug Act (ODA) of January 1983, passed in the United States, with lobbying from the National Organization for Rare Disorders and many other organizations, is meant to encourage pharmaceutical companies to develop drugs for diseases that have a small market. Under the ODA drugs, vaccines, and diagnostic agents would qualify for orphan status if they were intended to treat a disease affecting fewer than 200,000 American citizens. Under the ODA orphan drug sponsors qualify for seven-year FDA-administered market Orphan Drug Exclusivity (ODE), \\"tax credits of up to 50% of R&D; costs, R&D; grants, waived FDA fees, protocol assistance and may get clinical trial tax incentives. In the U.S., orphan drug designation means that the sponsor qualifies for certain benefits, but it does not mean the drug is safe, effective or legal. In 2002, the Rare Diseases Act was signed into law. It amended the Public Health Service Act to establish the Office of Rare Diseases. It also increased funding for the development of treatments for people with rare diseases. =European Union= In 2000, the European Union (EU) enacted similar legislation, Regulation(EC) No 141/2000, which refers to drugs developed to treat rare diseases to as \\"orphan medicinal products\\". The EU's definition of an orphan condition is broader than that of the USA, in that it also covers some tropical diseases that are primarily found in developing nations. Orphan drug status granted by the European Commission gives marketing exclusivity in the EU for 10 years after approval. The EU's legislation is administered by the Committee on Orphan Medicinal Products of the European Medicines Agency (EMA). In late 2007 the FDA and EMA agreed to use a common application process for both agencies to make it easier for manufacturers to apply for orphan drug status but, while continuing two separate approval processes. Alt URL =Other countries= Legislation has been implemented by Japan, Singapore, and Australia that offers subsidies and other incentives to encourage the development of drugs that treat orphan diseases. =Numbers of new drugs= Under the ODA and EU legislation, many orphan drugs have been developed, including drugs to treat glioma, multiple myeloma, cystic fibrosis, phenylketonuria, snake venom poisoning, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. The Pharmaceutical Executive opines, that the \\"ODA is nearly universally acknowledged to be a success\\". Before the United States Congress enacted the ODA in 1983, only 38 drugs were approved in the USA specifically to treat orphan diseases. In the USA, from January 1983 to June 2004, the Office of Orphan Products Development 249 orphan drugs received marketing authorization and granted 1,129 different orphan drug designations, compared to fewer than ten such products in the decade prior to 1983. From 1983 until May 2010, the FDA approved 353 orphan drugs and granted orphan designations to 2,116 compounds. As of 2010, 200 of the roughly 7,000 officially designated orphan diseases have become treatable. Critics have questioned whether orphan drug legislation was the real cause of this increase, claiming that many of the new drugs were for disorders which were already being researched anyway, and would have had drugs developed regardless of the legislation, and whether the ODA has truly stimulated the production of non-profitable drugs; the act also has been criticised for allowing some pharmaceutical companies to make a large profit of drugs which have a small market but sell for a high price. While the European Medicines Agency grants orphan drugs market access to all member states, in practice, they only reach the market when a member state decides that its national health system will reimburse for the drug. For example, in 2008, 44 orphan drugs reached the market in the Netherlands, 35 in Belgium, and 28 in Sweden, while in 2007, 35 such drugs reached the market in France and 23 in Italy. Though not technically an orphan disease, the research and development into the treatment for AIDS has been heavily linked to the Orphan Drug Act. In the beginning of the AIDS epidemic the lack of treatment for the disease was often accredited to a believed lack of commercial base for a medication linked to HIV infection. This encouraged the FDA to use the Orphan Drug Act to help bolster research in this field, and by 1995 13 of the 19 drugs approved by the FDA to treat AIDS had received orphan drug designation, with 10 receiving marketing rights. These are in addition to the 70 designated orphan drugs designed to treat other HIV related illnesses. Examples for selected diseases = Cystic fibrosis = In the 1980s, people with cystic fibrosis rarely lived beyond their early teens. Drugs like Pulmozyme and tobramycin, both developed with aid from the ODA, revolutionized treatment for cystic fibrosis patients by significantly improving their quality of life and extending their life expectancies. Now, cystic fibrosis patients often survive into their thirties and some into their fifties. = Familial hypercholesterolemia = The 1985 Nobel Prize for medicine went to two researchers for their work related to familial hypercholesterolemia, which causes large and rapid increases in cholesterol levels. Their research led to the development of statin drugs which are now commonly used to treat high cholesterol. = Wilson's disease = Penicillamine was developed to treat Wilson's disease, a rare hereditary disease that can lead to a fatal accumulation of copper in the body. This drug was later found to be effective in treating arthritis. Bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate is currently under investigation as a therapy against Wilson's disease. = Phospholipase 2G6-associated neurodegeneration = In 2017, FDA granted RT001 orphan drug designation in the treatment of phospholipase 2G6-associated neurodegeneration (PLAN). Activism, research centers The Center for Orphan Drug Research at the University of Minnesota College of Pharmacy helps small companies with insufficient in-house expertise and resources in drug synthesis, formulation, pharmacometrics, and bio- analysis. The Keck Graduate Institute Center for Rare Disease Therapies (CRDT) in Claremont, California, supports projects to revive potential orphan drugs whose development has stalled by identifying barriers to commercialization, such as problems with formulation and bio-processing. Numerous advocacy groups such as the National Organization for Rare Disorders, Global Genes Project, Children's Rare Disease Network, Abetalipoproteinemia Collaboration Foundation, Zellweger Baby Support Network, and the Friedreich's Ataxia Research Alliance have been founded in order to advocate on behalf of patients suffering from rare diseases with a particular emphasis on diseases that afflict children. Cost According to a 2015 report published by EvaluatePharma, the economics of orphan drugs mirrors the economics of the pharmaceutical market as a whole but has a few very large differences. The market for orphan drugs is by definition very small, but while the customer base is drastically smaller the cost of research and development is very much the same as for non orphan drugs. This, the producers have claimed, causes them to charge extremely high amounts for treatment, sometimes as high as $700,000 a year, as in the case of Spinraza (Biogen), FDA approved in December 2016 for spinal muscular atrophy, placing a large amount of stress on insurance companies and patients. An analysis of 12 orphan drugs that were approved in the US between 1990 and 2000 estimated a price reduction of on average 50% upon loss of marketing exclusivity, with a range of price reductions from 14% to 95%. Governments have implemented steps to reduce high research and development cost with subsidies and other forms of financial assistance. The largest assistance are tax breaks which can be as high as 50% of research and development costs. Orphan drug manufacturers are also able to take advantage of the small customer base to cut cost on clinical trials due to the small number of cases to have smaller trials which reduces cost. These smaller clinical trials also allow orphan drugs to move to market faster as the average time to receive FDA approval for an orphan drug is 10 months compared to 13 months for non-orphan drugs. This is especially true in the market for cancer drugs, as a 2011 study found that between 2004 and 2010 orphan drug trials were more likely to be smaller and less randomized than their non-orphan counterparts, but still had a higher FDA approval rate, with 15 orphan cancer drugs being approved, while only 12 non-orphan drugs were approved. This allows manufactures to get cost to the point that it is economically feasible to produce these treatments. The subsidies can total up to 30 million dollars per fiscal year in the United States alone . By 2015, industry analysts and academic researchers agreed, that the sky-high price of orphan drugs, such as eculizumab, was not related to research, development and manufacturing costs. Their price is arbitrary and they have become more profitable than traditional medicines. Public funding =Evaluation criteria= By 2007 the use of economic evaluation methods regarding public- funding of orphan drugs, using estimates of the incremental cost- effectiveness, for example, became more established internationally. The QALY has often been used in cost-utility analysis to calculate the ratio of cost to QALYs saved for a particular health care intervention. By 2008 the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales, for example, operated with a threshold range of ¬£20,000‚Äì30,000 per quality- adjusted life year (QALY). By 2005 doubts were raised about the use of economic evaluations in orphan drugs. By 2008 most of the orphan drugs appraised had cost-effectiveness thresholds \\"well in excess of the 'accepted' level and would not be reimbursed according to conventional criteria.\\" As early as 2005 McCabe et al. argued that rarity should not have a premium and orphan drugs should be treated like other pharmaceuticals in general. Drummond et al. argued that the social value of health technologies should also be included in the assessment along with the estimation of the incremental cost- effectiveness ratio. =Abuse potential= Rosuvastatin (brand name Crestor) is an example of a drug that received Orphan Drug funding but was later marketed to a large consumer base. The very large incentives given to pharmaceutical companies to produce orphan drugs have led to the impression that the financial support afforded to make these drugs possible is akin to abuse. Because drugs can be used to treat multiple conditions, companies can take drugs that were filed with their government agency as orphan drugs to receive financial assistance, and then market it to a wide population to increase their profit margin. For example AstraZeneca's cholesterol drug Crestor was filed as a treatment for the rare disease pediatric familial hypercholesterolemia. After the drug was approved for orphan drug designation, and AstraZeneca had received tax breaks and other advantages, AstraZeneca later applied and received FDA approval for the drug to be used to treat cholesterol in all diabetics. =NICE= By 2008 if an orphan drug cost more than ¬£30,000 the NICE required other arguments for funding. In 2015, NICE held consultations with \\"patient groups, the Department of Health, companies, learned societies, charities and researchers\\" regarding the appraisal of medicines and other technologies.

History  Legend Entertainment was founded in 1989 by Bob Bates and Mike Verdu, after Activision closed their development studio at Infocom. Infocom had been a celebrated creator of adventure games before declaring bankruptcy. According to Bates, investors needed to see how a new company could succeed where Infocom had stumbled, and he eventually convinced investors that \\"there was still life in the adventure genre, but that it needed more than just text.\\" For their first titles, they hired other Infocom veterans, particularly developer and author Steve Meretzky. The company's debut title was Spellcasting 101: Sorcerers Get All The Girls, which evolved beyond simple text-based adventures with graphics for each of the game's \\"rooms\\". Meretsky describes this as a \\"fusion of the depth and detail of Infocom games with a graphical presentation that would be more in keeping with what audiences circa 1990 demanded\\", which led to greater sales than their former company. Starting in 1993, Legend switched to a new development system for graphic-only adventures. Several of their adventure games were based on book licenses, including Frederik Pohl's Gateway, Terry Brooks' Shannara, Spider Robinson's Callahan's Crosstime Saloon, Piers Anthony's Xanth, and Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman's The Death Gate Cycle. By 1994 games like Xanth and Eric the Unready gave Legend a reputation for comedy adventures. Though adventure games were at their peak in the early 1990s, Legend faced difficult competition in the genre from Sierra On-Line and LucasArts, who had larger budgets and greater sales. Legend shifted to development other under publishers in 1996, starting with Star Control 3 for Accolade, and Callahan‚Äôs Crosstime Saloon for Take-Two Interactive. The company was purchased by GT Interactive in 1998, particularly to acquire Legend's rights to develop an Unreal sequel. Their focus then shifted to developing action games. They developed a first-person shooter based on Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time and finished the development of the second part in the Unreal series in 2002. Late in 2003, they released a free expansion for Unreal II: The Awakening, known as XMP (eXpanded MultiPlayer). In 1999, Infogrames Entertainment, SA (IESA) announced that it would buy GT Interactive. On Friday, January 16, 2004, Legend Entertainment was shut down.

Hong Kong lacked patriotism and national identity, and would thus not be ready for universal suffrage until 2022. Ma also asked the Education Department to define massacre as events where over 4,000 were dead, which would make Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 not a massacre under the new definition. He later withdrew the redefinition request. =Responses= Democrats and relatives of victims all attacked Ma for his comments.

It took many years of campaigning, research and successful testing before the British Royal Navy changed to Harris's conductors from their previous less effective system. One of the successful test vessels was which survived lightning strikes unharmed on her famous voyage with Charles Darwin. was one of the first ships protected from lightning by Harris's conductors. Life and work Harris was born in Plymouth on 1 April 1791. His family was well established as solicitors in the town, and he went to Plymouth grammar school. His childhood in the seaport which included the naval dockyard renamed Devonport gave him an enduring interest in ships. He went to the University of Edinburgh to study medicine and qualified as a physician, then returned to Plymouth and set up a medical practice. His interest in the emerging science of electricity led him to invent his improved lightning conductor for ships in 1820. In 1824 he married, and decided to abandon his profession of medicine to concentrate on his studies of electricity. His paper \\"On the Relative Powers of various Metallic Substances as Conductors of Electricity\\", read before the Royal Society in 1826, led to him being elected a fellow of the society in 1831. He read papers on the elementary laws of electricity to the Society in 1834, 1836 and 1839, and also sent accounts of his experiments and discoveries to the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His experimental investigations into the force of high intensity electricity were published in the Philosophical Transactions of 1834. In 1835 Harris received the Royal Society's Copley Medal for his \\"Experimental Investigations of the Forces of Electricity of high Intensity\\". Harris was curator of apparatus in the museum of The Plymouth Institution (now The Plymouth Athenaeum) and held the office of President twice. His work on lightning conductors for ships gained him a government annuity of ¬£300 \\"in consideration of services in the cultivation of science\\", and to overcome continued objections to his proposals he published an 1843 work on Thunderstorms, as well as contributing papers to The Nautical Magazine on lightning damage. He was knighted in 1847 after the system had been adopted and shown successful, and was given a grant of ¬£5,000. Though his continued research did not find new discoveries, his manuals of Electricity, Galvanism and Magnetism were published between 1848 and 1856 and went through several editions. When he died in Plymouth on 22 January 1867 he had a Treatise on Frictional Electricity in preparation, and it was published later that year. Lightning conductor for ships The lightning rod invented by Benjamin Franklin in 1752 suggested a way of avoiding the common problem of lightning causing damage to the wooden sailing ships of the period. In Britain, the Royal Navy chose a protection system with a chain draped into the sea from the top of the mast as a lightning conductor. This system proved unsatisfactory: the chain was only supposed to be raised up the mast when lightning was anticipated, and lightning often struck unexpectedly. When the chain was raised it was a nuisance to seamen aloft in the rigging to deal with the square rigged sails, and even when it was raised, lightning strokes would sometimes damage the chain or the ship. There were also fears that the conductors would attract lightning to the ship, and prejudices against their use. The French navy devised a modified system in which the chain was led down the permanent rigging to connect to the copper sheathing which was used to protect the hull below the waterline against damage from collisions and shipworms. In the early 19th century they replaced the chains by metal cables. Harris invented a new system in 1820, with lightning conductor plates fixed along spars and down the aft side of the mast, right down through the hull to connect to the copper sheathing of the hull. All the principal metallic masses in the ship were to be bonded to the conductor to ensure that there were no side flashes. He proposed this system to the Admiralty in 1821 but found them unresponsive to his proposals, and he campaigned to persuade the Navy to test his system, and to publicise the extent of the problem. They agreed to test the system on eleven vessels, starting in 1830. =Trials on HMS Beagle= One of the first vessels outfitted for the test was , which had returned from its first survey voyage to South America, and was extensively rebuilt and refitted for the second survey voyage. As part of this work, \\"lightning-conductors, invented by Mr. Harris, were fixed in all the masts, the bowsprit, and even in the flying jib-boom.\\" The captain, Robert FitzRoy, had been given command in the middle of the first expedition after the previous captain committed suicide. Before being given that command, FitzRoy had been a lieutenant on board HMS Thetis in Rio harbour when her foremast was struck by lightning. The \\"fore-topmast was shivered into a mere collection of splinters\\" and the foremast irreparably damaged, delaying the ship for almost two months while \\"the foremast was taken out afterwards, and replaced by another, purchased from the Brazilian government at a great expense.\\" Near the end of 1831, while the Beagle was still being fitted out at Devonport in preparation for sailing, the recently graduated Charles Darwin arrived in Plymouth to take up the opportunity of sailing on the ship as a self-funded gentleman naturalist who would be a companion to the captain while the ship was at sea, and who would make his own expeditions inland while the ship's crew was surveying the coasts. He told his sister that he had \\"breakfasted yesterday with a Mr. Harris whom I like more than anybody I have seen.‚Äî He has written a great deal on Electricity\\", and wrote to tell his university tutor John Stevens Henslow about his progress, noting that he had met \\"one or two pleasant people, foremost of whom is Mr. Thunder & Lightning Harris, whom I daresay you have heard of.\\" In his diary he noted that on the evening of 21 November he attended a \\"popular lecture from Mr Harris on his lightning conductors\\" at the Athenaeum. Harris used an \\"Electric machine\\" for a thunder cloud and a tub of water for the sea, then with \\"a toy for a line of battle ship he showed the whole process of it being struck by lightning & most satisfactorily proved how completely his plan protects the vessel from any bad consequences. This plan consists in having plates of Copper folding over each other, let in the masts & yards & so connected to the water beneath. ‚Äî The principle, from which these advantages are derived, owes its utility, to the fact that the Electric fluid is weakened by being transmitted over a large surface to such an extent that no effects are perceived, even when the mast is struck by the lightning. ‚Äî The Beagle is fitted with conductors on this plan; it is very probable, we shall be the means of trying & I hope proving the utility of its effects.\\" The voyage took almost five years, and although the Beagle was frequently exposed to lightning and was thought to have been struck by lightning on at least two occasions, \\"when‚Äîat the instant of a vivid flash of lightning, accompanied by a crashing peal of thunder‚Äîa hissing sound was heard on the masts; and a strange, though very slightly tremulous, motion in the ship indicated that something unusual had happened\\", there was never the \\"slightest damage\\". Darwin himself reported this effect, and his conviction that \\"but for the conductor, the results would have been serious.\\" FitzRoy reported that the copper plates stayed firmly in place, even in small spars, and strengthened the spars rather than weakening them. FitzRoy gave the lightning protection high praise: =Naval adoption of the Harris conductors= Harris continued his extensive campaign to publicise the extent of the problem of lightning damage. He presented a report listing the damage caused to British naval vessels during the period from 1793 to 1838, including lightning causing 62 deaths and 114 injuries. Two study committees gave favourable recommendations for his system, but full implementation continued to be blocked by the opposition of the First Sea Lord until a change of government led to him being replaced by a new First Sea Lord late in 1841. In June 1842 the Royal Navy at last adopted the Harris conductors. By then the Imperial Russian Navy had already adopted Harris's invention, and in 1845 the Tsar presented him with a valuable ring and vase, in acknowledgment of his services. Harris continued to record the effects of lightning on ships of the Royal Navy, and published details of this research. In 1853 a report in The Nautical Magazine proudly stated that between 1830 and 1846 none of the ships protected by Harris conductors had suffered casualties from lightning, and they had not been struck by lightning to nearly the extent that unprotected ships had been. Taking a comparable period, at least 45 unprotected ships had been terribly damaged by lightning. It reflected on the boldness of leading the conductors down through the ship past crowded areas and combustible materials, and the prejudices the scheme had to overcome. It noted that the measure was founded on sound principles of science, and had been backed by eminent scientists including Sir Humphry Davy. Recalling the earlier opposition to Harris's proposals, it concluded with \\"feelings of satisfaction approaching to exultation at the complete success which has crowned his exertions\\".

The United States Senate inquiry and British Wreck Commissioner's inquiry into the sinking both concluded that the Californian could have saved many or all of the lives that were lost, had a prompt response been mounted to the Titanic distress rockets. The U.S. Senate inquiry was particularly critical of the vessel's Captain, Stanley Lord, calling his inaction during the disaster \\"reprehensible\\". Despite this criticism, no formal charges were ever brought against Lord and his crew for their inaction. Lord disputed the findings and would spend the rest of his life trying to clear his name. In 1992, the UK Government's Marine Accident Investigation Branch re-examined the case and while condemning the inaction of the Californian and Captain Lord, also concluded that due to the limited time available, \\"the effect of Californian taking proper action would have been no more than to place on her the task actually carried out by Carpathia, that is the rescue of those who escaped ‚Ä¶ [no] reasonably probable action by Captain Lord could have led to a different outcome of the tragedy.\\" Californian was later sunk on 9 November 1915, by the German submarines and , in the Eastern Mediterranean during World War I. History Californian was a British steamship owned by the Leyland Line, part of J.P. Morgan's International Mercantile Marine Co.. She was constructed by the Caledon Shipbuilding & Engineering Company in Dundee, Scotland, and was the largest ship built in Dundee up to that time. The ship was built to the maximum dimensions that were allowed to moor and outfit her in the Dundee Docks. The ship's size and importance to the local shipbuilding industry meant that there was a lot of local interest in her construction as it progressed. There were also some problems ‚Äì when both of the ship's boilers were being transported through the streets from a foundry to the shipyard the weight of them (carried on a wheeled bogie) caused considerable damage to the city's roads, as well as breaking a number of underground water pipes. Later when a crane was being used to rig a spar on one of the Californian four masts, the spar became tangled in nearby telephone wires and severed them. She was designed primarily to transport cotton, but also had the capacity to carry 47 passengers and 55 crew members. She measured 6,223 tons, was long, at her beam, and had a triple expansion steam engine powered by two double-ended boilers. Her average full speed was . Californian was launched on 26 November 1901 and completed her sea trials on 23 January 1902. From 31 January 1902 to 3 March 1902, she made her maiden voyage from Dundee to New Orleans, Louisiana, United States. Between late 1911 and early 1912, Californian had a Marconi wireless apparatus installed in a refitted cabin. Her first radio operator was Cyril Furmstone Evans. =Sinking of Titanic= Stanley Lord, who had commanded Californian since 27 March 1911, was her captain when she left the Royal Albert Dock, Liverpool, England on 5 April 1912 on her way to Boston, Massachusetts. She was not carrying any passengers on this voyage. On Sunday 14 April at 18:30 ship's time, Californian only wireless operator, Cyril Furmstone Evans (born 1892 in Croydon, Surrey, United Kingdom), signalled to the Antillian that three large icebergs were five miles to the south. Titanic wireless operator Harold Bride also received the warning and delivered it to the ship's bridge a few minutes later. Californian encountered a large ice field at 22:20 ship's time, and Captain Lord decided to stop the ship and wait until morning before proceeding further. Before leaving the bridge, he thought he saw a ship's light away to the eastward but could not be sure it was not just a rising star. Lord continued to the engineers' cabins and met with the chief, whom he told about his plans for stopping. As they were talking, they saw a ship's lights approaching. Lord asked Evans if he knew of any ships in the area, and Evans responded: \\"only the Titanic.\\" Lord asked Evans to inform her that Californian was stopped and surrounded by ice. Lord ordered Evans to warn all other ships in the area, which he did.A Night to Remember p.24 Titanic on-duty wireless operator, Jack Phillips, was busy clearing a backlog of passengers' messages with the wireless station at Cape Race, Newfoundland, away, at the time. Evans' message that SS Californian was stopped and surrounded by ice, due to the relative proximity of the two ships, drowned out a separate message Phillips had been in the process of receiving from Cape Race, and he rebuked Evans: \\"Shut up, shut up! I am busy; I am working Cape Race!\\" Philips never passed this message to the bridge, but in his defence, Evans had not prefixed the message with the letters, \\"MSG,\\" which stood for Master Service Gram, as was customary for all messages intended for the bridge. Evans, feeling that he had done what was asked of him despite Philips's rude apparent rejection of the message, then switched off his wireless equipment and went to bed. One hour and 10 minutes later, Titanic hit an iceberg. One hour and twenty-five minutes after that, she transmitted her first distress call. Third Officer Charles Groves of the Californian testified to the British inquiry that at 23:10 ship's time, he had seen the lights of another ship come into view 10 or 12 miles away, 3.5 points above Californian starboard beam. At about 23:30, Groves went below to inform Lord. The latter suggested that the ship be contacted by Morse lamp, which was tried, but no reply was seen. To Groves, she was clearly a large liner, as she had multiple decks brightly lit. The ship finally seemed to stop and extinguish her deck lights at 23:40, the same time Titanic stopped her engines. At the British inquiry, Groves agreed that if the ship he saw had turned two points to port, it would have concealed her deck lights. Slightly after midnight, Second Officer Herbert Stone took watch from Groves. He testified that he, too, observed the ship, judging it to be about five miles away. He tried signalling her with the Morse lamp, also without success. Apprentice officer James Gibson, who had been doing the Morse signalling, testified that at 00:55, Stone told him he had observed five rockets in the sky above the nearby ship. Stone testified that he had informed Captain Lord, although the British inquiry did not ask whether or not he communicated the number. Lord asked if the rockets had been a company signal, but Stone did not know. Lord and Stone both testified that Stone reported they were not distress signals. Lord ordered Stone to tell him if anything about the ship changed, to keep signaling it with the Morse lamp, but did not order that it be contacted by wireless. Gibson testified that Stone had expressed unease to him about the situation: \\"A ship is not going to fire rockets at sea for nothing,\\" Stone said. \\"She looks very queer out of the water‚Äîher lights look queer.\\" Gibson observed, \\"She looks rather to have a big side out of the water\\", and he agreed that \\"everything was not all right with her;\\" that it was \\"a case of some kind of distress.\\" Stone, however, under questioning by the British inquiry which became more and more incredulous, testified repeatedly that he did not think at the time that the rockets could have been distress signals, and that the possibility did not occur to him until he learned the Titanic had sunk. By 02:00, the ship appeared to be leaving the area. A few minutes later, Gibson informed Captain Lord as such and that eight white rockets had been seen. Lord asked whether he was sure of the color. Gibson said yes and left. At 02:20, Titanic sank. At 03:40, Stone and Gibson, still sharing the middle watch, spotted rockets to the south. They did not see the ship that was firing them, but at about this same time RMS Carpathia was racing up from the southeast, firing rockets to let Titanic know that help was on the way. At 04:16, Chief Officer George F. Stewart relieved Stone, and almost immediately noticed, coming into view from the south, a brilliantly lit, four-masted steamship with one funnel; Carpathia arrived on the scene shortly after 04:00. Captain Lord woke up at 04:30 and went out on deck to decide how to proceed past the ice to the west. He sent Stewart to wake Evans and find out what happened to the ship they had seen to the south. They subsequently learned from the Frankfurt that the Titanic had sunk overnight. Lord ordered the ship underway. Californian course took her west, slowly passing through the ice field, after which she turned south. Californian was sighted at 06:00 by steaming from the north. Californian actually passed the Carpathia to the east, then turned, and headed northeast back towards the rescue ship, arriving at 08:30. Carpathia was just finishing picking up the last of Titanic survivors. After communicating with Californian, Carpathia left the area, leaving Californian to search for any other survivors. However, Californian only found scattered wreckage, empty lifeboats and corpses, and continued on its route to America. Upon arrival, several key crew members, including Lord and Evans, were summoned to give evidence at the American inquiry. Evans also gave evidence at the British inquiry into the tragedy. Like others involved in the disaster, he was offered a lot of money from newspapers for his story, but he refused it. =Aftermath= As public knowledge grew of the Titanic disaster, questions soon arose about how the disaster occurred, as well as if and how it could have been prevented. A United States Senate inquiry into the sinking of the RMS Titanic started on 19 April 1912, the day Californian arrived unnoticed in Boston. Initially, the world was unaware of her and her part in the Titanic disaster. On 22 April, the inquiry discovered that a ship near Titanic had failed to respond to the distress signals. The identity of the ship was unknown. The next day, a small newspaper in New England, The Clinton Daily Item, printed a shocking story claiming that Californian had refused aid to Titanic. The source for the story was Californian carpenter, James McGregor, who stated that he had been close enough to see Titanic lights and distress rockets. By sheer coincidence, on the same day, the Boston American printed a story sourced by Californians assistant engineer, Ernest Gill, which essentially told the same story as the Daily Item. Captain Lord also spoke with Boston area newspapers. In a Boston Traveller article dated 19 April, Lord claimed that his ship was 30 miles from Titanic, but in a Boston Post article dated 24 April, he claimed 20 miles. He told the Boston Globe that his ship had spent three hours steaming around the wreck site trying to render assistance, but Third Officer Grove later stated that the search ended after two hours, at 10:40. When reporters asked Lord about his exact position the night of the disaster, he refused to respond, calling such information \\"state secrets\\". After the newspaper revelations on 23 April, the U.S. Senate inquiry subpoenaed Gill, as well as Captain Lord, and others from Californian. During his testimony, Gill repeated his claims. Lord's testimony was conflicting and changing. For example, he detailed three totally different ice conditions. He admitted knowing about the rockets (after telling Boston newspapers that his ship had not seen any rockets) but insisted that they were not distress rockets, and they were not fired from Titanic but a small steamship, the so-called \\"third ship\\" of the night. Yet the testimony of Captain J. Knapp, U.S. Navy, and a part of the Navy Hydrographer's Office, made clear that Titanic and Californian were in sight of each other, and no third vessel had been in the area. The so-called \\"scrap log\\" of Californian also came under question. This is a log wherein all daily pertinent information is entered before being approved by the captain and entered into the official log. Company policy of International Mercantile Marine Co., the parent of both Leyland Line and the White Star Line, required scrap logs to be destroyed daily. The official log mentioned neither a nearby ship nor rockets. At the British inquiry, Stone was not asked to recall the notations he had actually written in the scrap log, during his bridge-watch between midnight and 4:00 on 15 April. On 2 May, the British Court of Formal Investigation began. Again, Lord gave conflicting, changing, and evasive testimony. By way of contrast, Captain Arthur Rostron of Carpathia, at each inquiry, gave consistent and forthright testimony. It is significant that, during the British Inquiry, Rostron was asked to confirm an affidavit he had made to the United States Inquiry. Among the other things in his affidavit, he confirmed that \\"It was daylight at about 4.20 a.m. At 5 o'clock it was light enough to see all around the horizon. We then saw two steamships to the northwards, perhaps 7 or 8 miles distant. Neither of them was Californian.\\" During the inquiry, the crew of Californian, like Captain Lord, gave conflicting testimonies. Most notably, Lord said he was not told that the nearby ship had disappeared, contradicting testimony from James Gibson who said he reported it, and Lord had acknowledged him. Also during the inquiries, Titanic survivors recalled seeing the lights of another ship after Titanic had hit the iceberg. To Titanics Fourth Officer Boxhall, the other ship appeared to be off Titanics bow, five miles (8 km) away and heading in her direction. Just like Californian officers, Boxhall attempted signaling the ship with a Morse lamp, but received no response. However, Titanic lookout Frederick Fleet, who was in the crow's nest when the iceberg was sighted and remained there for another forty minutes, testified at the US inquiry that he did not see the lights of another ship while in the crow's nest. He only saw a light later after leaving the ship on a lifeboat. Titanics Captain Edward Smith had felt the ship was close enough that he ordered the first lifeboats launched on the port side to row over to the ship, drop off the passengers, and come back to Titanic for more. Moreover, lifeboat occupants reported the other ship's lights were seen from the lifeboats throughout the night; one lifeboat rowed towards them but never seemed to get any closer. Both the American and British inquires found that Californian must have been closer than the claimed by Captain Lord, and that each ship was visible from the other. Indeed, when Carpathia arrived at the wreck site, a vessel was clearly seen to the north; this was later identified as Californian. Both inquiries concluded that Captain Lord had failed to provide proper assistance to Titanic, the British Inquiry concluding further Californians responding to Titanics rockets and going to assist \\"‚Ä¶ might have saved many if not all of the lives that were lost.\\" In the months and years following the disaster, numerous preventive safety measures were enacted. The United States passed the Radio Act of 1912, which required 24-hour radio watch on all ships in case of an emergency. The first International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea formed a treaty that also required 24-hour radio monitoring and standardized the use of distress rockets. Despite the criticisms of Lord's conduct, no formal charges were ever brought against him. As a result, he had no right of appeal against the inquiry's findings. The issue lay dormant for almost half a century, when the publication of Walter Lord's (unrelated to Captain Lord) book A Night to Remember in 1955 and the release of the 1958 film of the same name prompted Lord to seek a re-hearing of the Inquiry relating to his ship, to counter the allegations made in the book and his portrayal in the film. Petitions presented to the UK Government in 1965 and 1968 by the Mercantile Marine Service Association (MMSA), a union to which Captain Lord belonged, failed to get the matter re-examined. However, when the wreck of the Titanic was discovered by Ballard's expedition in 1985, it was found to be 13 miles from its reported position (the location accepted by both inquiries), so the Board of Trade ordered a re-examination. The British Government's Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) concluded its reappraisal of evidence in 1992. The conclusions were those of Deputy Chief Inspector, James de Coverly, stating: \\"What is significant, however, is that no ship was seen by the Titanic until well after the collision ‚Ä¶ watch was maintained with officers on the bridge and seamen in the crow‚Äôs nest, and with their ship in grave danger the lookout for another vessel which could come to their help must have been most anxious and keen. It is in my view inconceivable that the Californian or any other ship was within the visible horizon of the Titanic during that period; it equally follows that the Titanic can't have been within the Californian‚Äôs horizon.\\" The report went on: \\"More probably, in my view, the ship seen by Californian was another, unidentified, vessel.\\" The original investigator of the 1992 reappraisal was a Captain Barnett, who unlike de Coverly, concluded \\"that the Titanic was seen by the Californian and indeed kept under observation from 23:00 or soon after on 14 April until she sank ‚Ä¶ [based on] the evidence from Captain Lord and the two watch officers, Mr. Grove and Mr. Stone.\\" It was after Barnett's original report was submitted that Captain de Coverly was given the task of further examination. Both Barnett and de Coverly had concluded that Titanic rockets had been seen and that Stone and Lord had not responded appropriately to signals of distress. The 1992 MAIB report concluded that Captain Lord and his crew's actions \\"fell far short of what was needed\\". The report did concede that even if \\"proper action had been taken\\", Californian could not have arrived on the scene until \\"well after the sinking\\". It also noted that when he did know of Titanic distress, Lord twice took his ship across an ice field to help search for survivors. Captain Lord's chief defender and union attorney, Leslie Harrison, who had led the fight to have the Californian incident re-examined by the British government, called the dual conclusions of the report \\"an admission of failure to achieve the purpose of the reappraisal.\\" The 1992 report by the MAIB was published just months after their publication of another controversial report, on the subject of the Marchioness disaster of 1989. This report had led to questions over the evidence-gathering, conduct and judgements of the MAIB. Author Paul Lee accused Captain Lord of an \\"inability or unwillingness to adjust to an entirely new situation.\\" Although Lord had stopped his ship upon encountering ice, the British inquiry concluded that if Californian had acted upon the rockets and pushed through the ice, the Californian \\"might have saved many, if not all, of the lives that were lost\\". The U.S Senate inquiry was also critical of Lord's inaction, the final report stating that \\"such conduct, whether arising from indifference or gross carelessness, is most reprehensible, and places upon the commander the Californian a grave responsibility.\\". Senator William Alden Smith, in a speech to the U.S. Senate inquiry, said: \\"the failure of Capt. Lord to arouse the wireless operator on his ship, who could have easily ascertained the name of the vessel in distress and reached her in time to avert loss of life, places a tremendous responsibility upon this officer from which it will be very difficult for him to escape.\\" Author Daniel Allen Butler wrote: \\"The crime of Stanley Lord was not that he may have ignored the Titanic‚Äôs rockets, but that he unquestionably ignored someone‚Äôs cry for help.\\" Others have suggested that, considering all the circumstances, there was actually little if anything the Californian could have done to prevent or reduce the loss of life. Allegations have been made that trade unions defending Captain Lord succeeded in influencing the reports from the official investigations before they were available to the public. Williams and Kamps wrote in Titanic and the Californian: \\"Bearing [the] distance in mind, and recalling that a mere fifty-five minutes had elapsed from the time Captain Lord was first informed about the rockets to the moment the Titanic slipped beneath the waves, it would have been nothing short of a miracle for Lord to bring his ship to the Titanic and effect a rescue in such a short space of time.\\" Titanic Historian Tim Maltin theorized that the Californian's inaction was the result of a cold water mirage, or Superior mirage, arising from differences in air temperature over the warmer waters of the Atlantic Ocean and the colder waters of the Labrador Current. Maltin suggested that this would cause a superior refraction, superimposing and stretching and distorting the edge of the sea and lifting images of objects, distorting their appearance. This would explain why the Titanic's morse lamp was believed to be a flickering oil lamp on the mast of a much smaller ship, and why Capt. Lord thought the Titanic was a different vessel. If correct, Maltin's theory may further explain why the Titanic's lookouts did not spot the iceberg earlier. Cyril Evans continued his service with the Marconi's Wireless Telegraph Company and its successor companies (Eastern Telegraph Company and Cable & Wireless: the later part of his career was spent as manager for Cable and Wireless on the West Indian island of St Lucia) for the rest of his life. He also served at sea in World War I and World War II, running mobile telecommunications for the British Army in North Africa and then Italy. He married and raised a family. In the film A Night to Remember, Evans was portrayed by Geoffrey Bayldon. =World War I= On 2 July 1913, Californian was docked in Veracruz when a fire erupted in her no.3 & 4 holds, sustaining serious damage to herself and her cargo.https://www.encyclopedia- titanica.org/titanic-ships/californian.html Californian continued in normal commercial service until World War I, when the British government took control of her. On 9 November 1915, while en route from Salonica to Marseilles, she was torpedoed by the German U-boat . While she was under tow by a French patrol boat, she was torpedoed again, and, around 7:45am, she sank in 10‚Äì13,000 feet of water, approximately south-southwest of Cape Matapan, Greece by , killing one person (fireman Richard John Harding) and injuring two others. To date, Californians wreck remains undiscovered. Californian went down less than from where HMHS Britannic, Titanics sister ship, would be sunk by a mine just over a year later. In popular culture The involvement of the Californian in the sinking of the Titanic is examined in the 2012 BBC TV drama SOS - The Titanic Inquiry. The drama tells the story of the original British Inquiry into the sinking of Titanic and whether the Californian was in near enough proximity to the vessel to rescue some, if not all, of the 1,500 lives lost.

It is a member of genus Catharus and is typical of it in terms of its subdued coloration and beautiful, ascending flute-like voice. Swainson's thrush was named after William Swainson, an English ornithologist. Etymology The genus name Catharus comes from the Ancient Greek katharos, \\"pure or clean\\" and refers to the plumage of the orange-billed nightingale- thrush C. aurantiirostris. The specific ustuatus is Latin for \\"burnt\\", from urere, \\"to burn\\". South Padre Island - Texas Habitat The breeding habitat of Swainson's thrush is coniferous woods with dense undergrowth across Canada, Alaska, and the northern United States; also, deciduous wooded areas on the Pacific coast of North America. Range & distribution These birds migrate to southern Mexico and as far south as Argentina. The coastal subspecies migrate down the Pacific coast of North America and winter from Mexico to Costa Rica, whereas the continental birds migrate eastwards within North America (a substantial detour) and then travel southwards via Florida to winter from Panama to Bolivia. Swainson's thrush is a very rare vagrant to western Europe. It has also occurred as a vagrant in northeast Asia.Brazil, Mark (2009) Birds of East Asia page 402 Threats This species may be displaced by the hermit thrush where their ranges overlap. Possibly, the latter species adapts more readily to human encroachment upon its habitat. At least in the winter quarters, Swainson's thrush tends to keep away from areas of human construction and other activity. Description This species is in length. The wingspan averages at and the wing chord is . The bill measures in length and the tarsus is long. This species' body mass can range from .Thrushes by Peter Clement. Princeton University Press (2001), This thrush has the white-dark-white underwing pattern characteristic of Catharus thrushes. Adults are brown on the upperparts. The underparts are white with brown on the flanks; the breast is lighter brown with darker spots. They have pink legs and a light brown eye ring. Birds in the east are more olive-brown on the upperparts; western birds are more reddish brown. This bird's song is a hurried series of flute-like tones spiralling upwards. Diet They forage on the forest floor, also in trees. Swainson's thrushes mainly eat insects, fruits and berries.Out of the wide range of fruit eaten by this bird, those of Cymbopetalum mayanum (Annonaceae) and especially Trophis racemosa (Moraceae) are well-liked whenever available in the winter quarters. However, they are generally not taken from feeders or disturbed habitat: Foster (2007) They make a cup nest on a horizontal tree branch. Subspecies Four subspecies are recognised, Cathartus ustulatus alame, C. u. swainsoni, C. u. ustulatus and C. u. oedicus. Subspecies Cathartus ustulatus alame and C. u. swainsoni summer east of the British Columbian Coast Mountains, the Cascades and the Sierra Nevada, and C. u. ustulatus and C. u. oedicus summer west of these ranges. There is a small area of overlap in the Coast Mountains. Recent molecular systematics workRuegg & Smith (2002) confirms that these two pairs of subspecies form two genetically distinct clades, referred to as the continental and coastal clades, which diverged during the Late Pleistocene era, probably about 10,000 years ago as the last ice age came to its end and habitats shifted across North America. A Swainson's thrush in British Columbia The genetic differences between the subspecies, and the circuitous migratory route of the continental birds, strongly suggest that these species underwent a rapid range expansion following the end of the last ice age, with populations originally summering in the south-east of North America expanding their ranges northwards and westwards as the ice retreated. Details of the molecular genetic analysis support the hypothesis of rapid expansion of both coastal and continental populations. The current migratory routes of the continental birds, especially the western populations, are not optimal in ecological terms, and presumably represent an inherited, historical route pattern that has not yet adapted to the birds' modern population locations. These results notwithstanding, analysis of mtDNA cytochrome b and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 as well as nuclear Œ≤-fibrinogen intron 7 sequence dataWinker & Pruett (2006) shows that Swainson's thrush is the most ancient North American species of its genus; it is not closely related to other Catharus and the outward similarities with the other North American species are due to convergent evolution.

He is the founding member of the largest pro-Beijing party the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB) from 1992 to 2003 and the 2nd President of the Legislative Council from 2008 to 2016. Graduated from the University of Hong Kong, Tsang chose to teach in the leftist Pui Kiu Middle School and became its principal before he stepped into politics in the 1980s. In 1992 he founded the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong and first contested in the 1995 Legislative Council election in which he lost the race. He was elected in Kowloon West in the first Legislative Council election after the handover of Hong Kong in 1998. He was also the member of the Executive Council from 2002 to 2008. He became the President of the Legislative Council in 2008. Due to his relatively fair and accommodating presiding styles and his relatively liberal image within the pro-Beijing camp, he enjoyed high popularity within his last years before his retirement from the Legislative Council in 2016. He also expressed interest in running in the 2012 and 2017 Chief Executive elections but did not stand eventually. Early life and education Tsang was born in Guangzhou, Guangdong, China on 17 May 1947. Tsang's father, Tsang Chiu-kan was a clerk at the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, a pro-Beijing business organisation in the colony. He moved to Hong Kong when he was two years old and grew up in Sai Wan's Academic Terrace. Tsang received his primary and secondary education at St. Paul's College run by the Hong Kong Anglican Church. He studied Mathematics at the University of Hong Kong, graduating with first class honours. Tsang grew his patriotic sentiments and interest in Marxism by reading the leftist newspaper Wen Wei Po which his father brought home from work everyday and worshipped Qian Xuesen, a renowned scientist who returned to the mainland from the United States in the 1950s. In 1966, he went back to Guangzhou with his mother and was impressed by the socialist life there. He proclaimed himself a Marxist and studied works of Karl Marx and Mao Zedong with like-minded classmates at a time when the majority of the students at the University of Hong Kong supported the colonial rule and had negative views on the communist regime in China. 1967 riots and teaching life He joined several university students in making donations to the leftist unions through Wen Wei Po following the industrial dispute at the Hong Kong Artificial Flower Works in April 1967 which later escalated to large-scale riots. He joined the demonstrations in Central and founded a student journal called New HKU to launch a counter- propaganda against The Undergrad, the official publication of the Hong Kong University Students' Union which was critical of the riots. His brother, Tsang Tak-sing, was arrested, tried and convicted for distributing anti-government leaflets at school, and was imprisoned for 18 months. In the wake of his brother's event, Tsang gave up the plans to further his studies abroad although he had been accepted by four prominent universities in the United States. After graduating from the University of Hong Kong, Tsang gave up his supposedly bright future as a university graduate and joined the leftist Piu Kiu Middle School as a teacher under the patronage of principal Ng Hong-mun, at the time the pro-Communist leftists were marginalised by the colonial government. After the downfall of Gang of Four in 1976, Tsang began to question his own socialist beliefs. He obtained a Graduate Diploma of Education in 1981 and a Master of Education at the University of Hong Kong in 1983. He went on to become the principal of the Piu Kiu Middle School in 1986 until he left his position to become a full-time politician. He became the supervisor of the school and was also the supervisor of a newly established direct-subsidised school, the Pui Kiu College. Political career =Stepping into politics= Despite the events of Gang of Four and the political instability, Tsang remained faithful to the Communist Party of China. Due to his good education background, Tsang became a high-flyer within the leftist camp. He stepped into the politics in 1976 when he was appointed a member of the Guangdong provincial committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). He later became a member of the CPPCC National Committee in 1993. In the mid 1980s, Tsang was actively involved in the discussion of the drafting of the Basic Law of Hong Kong, the mini- constitution after the transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong in 1997. He was one of the members of the \\"Group of 38\\" proposal consisting of educators with leftist background led by Basic Law Consultative Committee member Cheng Kai-nam which put forward a middle-of-the-ground proposal between the uncompromising rift of the pro-business conservative \\"Group of 89\\" and the pro-democracy liberal \\"Group of 190\\" proposals. During the Tiananmen protests of 1989, Tsang called for the support of the teachers and students of the Pui Kiu Middle School to support the Tiananmen students and their cause for a democratic China. After the massacre on 4 June, he told the reporters that he was \\"shocked and sad\\". However he and other leftists soon reiterated their position on the event and were recalled under Beijing's command. =DAB Chairman= After the defeat of the traditional leftist candidates in the first direct election of the Legislative Council by the pro-democracy candidates of the United Democrats of Hong Kong in the wake of the pro- democracy sentiment after the Tiananmen incident in 1991, Tsang and other leftists founded the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong under the call of director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office Lu Ping to gear up the \\"patriotic force\\" in the territory. Tsang became the first chairman of the party. He was subsequently appointed to the Preparatory Committee for the establishment of Hong Kong. In the 1995 Legislative Council election, he ran in Kowloon Central but was defeated by the less known candidate Liu Sing-lee from the pro-democracy Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood (ADPL). He received around 16,000 votes, 43 per cent of the total vote share. He was subsequently elected to the Provisional Legislative Council in 1996 by the Beijing-controlled Selection Committee. Tsang was first directly elected to the Legislative Council in the first post-handover election in 1998, representing the Kowloon West constituency. In 2002 he was appointed to the Executive Council by Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa. In 2002 the fifth anniversary of the Special Administrative Region, he was awarded the Gold Bauhinia Star (GBS) by the government. As the ally of the Tung administration, the DAB suffered criticisms with the unpopular government. During the controversy surrounding the enactment of the national security bill in Hong Kong, Tsang drew criticism for his party's support of the government's legislative initiatives. Following the 1 July 2003 protests and disappointing performance of his party in the 2003 District Council election, he resigned from the party's chairmanship in December 2003. =Legislative Council President= He gave up his Kowloon West seat and ran in the Hong Kong Island in the 2008 Legislative Council election. After the election, he was elected to the presidency of the Legislative Council, replacing the retired Rita Fan. He is widely assumed to be a member of the Chinese Communist Party, in part because, when asked directly, he has stated only that, \\"Since the foundation of the DAB, I have been asked whether I am a Communist Party member many times. And I can say frankly, I have never answered this question. The reason is, Hong Kong people's attitude to the concept of the Communist Party is very negative.\\"\\"DAB's Tsang still silent on communist membership\\", South China Morning Post, 8 October 2008.

He resigned from the Executive Council after being elected the President. Tsang was also criticised for the manner in which he presided over Legislative Council meetings, which led to walkout protests, though he was generally perceived to be fair and accommodating and enjoyed friendly relations with both pro-Beijing and pan-democratic members.Lee, Colleen (14 October 2011). \\"Fury at 'thug, triad' barbs\\".

After the legislative vote of the 2015 Hong Kong electoral reform in which the pro-Beijing legislators undertook a controversial and embarrassing walkout, the Oriental Daily published leaked messages in which Tsang was seen to have discussed voting strategy with a pro- Beijing legislator in a WhatsApp group before the electoral reform package and suggesting the legislators delay their speeches so that the pan-democrats could not control the timing of the vote. The pan-democrats questioned Tsang's neutrality in the chamber, seeing the text messages as \\"clear evidence\\" that he was colluding with the rest of the government's allies and planned to mull a no-confidence vote against him. He apologised to the legislators but refused to resign. In annual polls conducted by the University of Hong Kong Public Opinion Programme, Tsang was voted \\"Hong Kong‚Äôs most popular Legislative Councillor\\" for each of the last 13 years he was in office, 2004-2016 inclusive.

The battle was fought between the United States Army under Lieutenant Colonel Frank Wheaton and a band of the Native American Modoc tribe from Oregon and California, led by Captain Jack (Kintpuash in Modoc). The US Army forces tried to dislodge the Modoc from the natural fortress, now called Captain Jack's Stronghold, in the lava beds along the south shore of Tule Lake in northeastern California. They had illegally left the Klamath Reservation in Oregon, to which they had been relocated from their territory in order to enable European Americans to settle in the area. The Modoc soundly defeated the Army, inflicting numerous casualties and forcing it to retreat. Factors aiding the Modoc included their excellent defensive position, steady patience, and a thick fog that obscured portions of the battlefield. Background Immediately after the inconclusive November 27, 1872 Battle of Lost River in Oregon, the Modoc escaped to the lava beds in what is now Lava Beds National Monument, California. Their band included women and children. There they joined a Modoc band led by Shacknasty Jim from Hot Creek, who had not been involved in the Lost River action. The Modoc were encamped at a natural fortress of caves and trenches 300 yards (300 m) wide and 2 miles (3 km) long in the lava beds, which they had improved to make more defensible. The Modoc had captured about 100 head of cattle which they relied on as a food supply. The Army moved units from across the Department of the Columbia to the south end of Tule Lake, where the units established two encampments, the larger at Van Brimmer's Ranch, about 10 miles west of the Stronghold, and a smaller force at Louis Land's Ranch, 12 miles (19 km) to the east. Forces =Modoc= The Modoc bands numbered about 160 people, 53 of whom were warriors. The leaders of the group were Captain Jack, Shaknasty Jim, Scarfaced Charley, Hooker Jim, and John Schonchin. =United States= The US Army force in the field consisted of about 400 men. Lieutenant Colonel Frank Wheaton was in command, and had his headquarters at Van Brimmer's Ranch. Major John Green commanded the force in the west, and Captain Reuben Bernard was in command of the forces in the east. The west force, under Major Green, consisted of the 21st Infantry under Major Edwin Mason; two companies of the Oregon militia under General John E. Ross; 1st Cavalry, Troop F, under Captain David Perry; a company of California volunteers under Captain John O. Fairchild, and one section of two 12-pounder (5 kg) mountain howitzers under 2nd Lieutenant W. H. Miller. Captain Bernard's much smaller force consisted of 1st Cavalry, Troop B under Captain James Jackson and Troop G under 2nd Lieutenant John Kyle; and a company of Klamath scouts under Dave Hill. Preparation for attack Colonel Wheaton planned a two-pronged attack. The main force in the west would launch the primary attack, with a secondary attack from the east to prevent the Modoc escaping. The two forces were to spread out and meet in the middle of the lava fields, south of the Stronghold, trapping the Modoc against Tule Lake. The howitzers were to provide support for the western attack. All men were to proceed on foot. The units left their camps on January 16 to move into position. Major Green's units arrived at the southwest corner of Tule Lake at 1 pm; the artillery, which had traveled a longer, though flatter route, arrived after dark. Their camp was at the top of a bluff, overlooking the lava beds, about 3 miles west of the Stronghold. Captain Bernard's group also advanced on the 16th, their objective being Hospital Rock, two miles east of the Stronghold. However, a thick fog obscured their view and the forces came within a mile of the Stronghold. At this point Bernard ordered a withdrawal, but the Modoc had already observed them and gave chase. They began firing on Bernard's left flank and pack train, before being run off. Three of Bernard's men were wounded in the exchange. Bernard's force withdrew to Hospital Rock, and prepared for the next day's battle. Battle On the morning of January 17, the battlefield was covered with a thick fog and the weather was damp. In the west Major Green formed a skirmish line, with the 21st Infantry battalion and California volunteers on the left flank, next to the lake, and the Oregon militia on the right flank. He held a detachment of the 21st Infantry and 1st Cavalry, F Troop, in reserve to defend the howitzers. In the east, Bernard's force formed up with the Klamath Scouts and B Troop on the left flank, and G troop on the right flank, next to the lake. Captain Jack's cave at the Stronghold The battle orders called for the howitzers to fire three shots as a signal for Bernard to begin the attack, then they were to pause for 15 minutes before resuming firing to give the Modoc a chance to move their women and children out of the Stronghold. However, due to the fog, the howitzer crews could not determine where their shots were landing, and they did not resume firing after the signal shots for fear of hitting their own forces. Green's force advanced on the Stronghold, and after covering 1.5 miles (2.4 km), reformed with F Troop taking the extreme right flank, to attempt to join up with Bernard's force. At about this time the western force first began taking fire from the Modoc, who had left the Stronghold to attack the Army in the lava beds. Green's advance was slowed to almost nothing as the rough terrain and the enemy fire combined to make advance difficult. The Modoc, concealed by the fog and hiding in the rock formations, shot any target presented to them as they slowly gave ground, causing many casualties among the Army. At about 2 pm, Green's force came to a \\"very deep chasm\\", which stopped their advance. In the east, after advancing to about 500 yards (500 m) from the Stronghold, Bernard's force also came under fire from the Modoc; they charged the enemy as the ground on the east was much easier than on the west. However, after advancing 100 yards (100 m), they encountered a deep gully which they determined to be impassable, and withdrew 150 yards (150 m). Here Bernard's force began building crude fortifications out of the available rock. Modocs Scalping and Torturing Prisoners, an 1873 wood engraving At this point, Colonel Wheaton abandoned the plan to join the two forces south of the Stronghold. Major Green suggested that they instead attempt to join the units along the lake shore, north of the Stronghold. Orders were shouted to Bernard, who accepted the change in plans. However, Bernard's force, behind their makeshift walls, were unwilling to renew the attack. The east force did maintain their position and drew the enemy's fire. With the exception of the Oregon militia, who claimed to be stopped by a ravine, Green's force began to move to the north along the shore. The California volunteers, 21st Infantry, and F Troop advanced behind the Stronghold, and were within 50 yards (50 m) north of the Stronghold when they were pinned down on the shore by overwhelming Modoc fire. Major Green was wounded when he stood up and urged his men forward, an act for which he later received the Medal of Honor. F Troop and half the 21st Infantry eventually made it to Bernard's force, but the rest of the Infantry and the California volunteers were pinned down along the lake shore and were ordered to remain in place until dark. At 5 pm, Colonel Wheaton realized he had failed to capture the Stronghold, and signaled Green and Bernard to retreat. The forces withdrew to their camps, a process that was not completed until after nightfall on January 18. The US soldiers the Modoc had killed were left on the battlefield, which provided the Modoc with additional rifles and ammunition. The US lost 37 men killed or wounded; the Modoc suffered no casualties. Given the fog and rock cover, no Army survivors reported having seen a Modoc during the battle. The Modoc's spiritual leader, Curley Headed Doctor, took credit for raising the fog through his rituals.David, Eric. \\"Captain Jack's Stronghold: Ghost Dancing\\" , 25 Sept 2008 (10 Feb 2009) Aftermath The defeat of the Army at the First Battle of the Stronghold strengthened the Modoc position. The United States began peace negotiations from a position of weakness. The Modoc also gained confidence in their ability to defend their position against a superior force. Lt. Col. Wheaton was relieved of command, and replaced by Col. Alvan Gillem, a veteran of the Seminole War. The US Army brought reinforcements to Tule Lake from San Francisco, Nevada, and Oregon. It recruited additional scouts from the Warm Springs Indian Reservation, while the Oregon militia and California volunteers left the field. During the peace conferences that followed the battle, Major General Edward Canby, commanding officer of the Department of the Columbia, came to the lava beds to lead the peace effort. Mistakenly thinking that killing leaders would encourage the Army to leave the Modoc alone, on Good Friday, April 11, 1873, Captain Jack and some of his men ambushed and killed General Canby and Reverend Eleazer Thomas, and wounded two more. This act ended the peace talks. The Army initiated the Second Battle of the Stronghold starting April 15.

It was at the forefront of scientific developments in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries, and is one of the earliest Academies of Sciences. Currently headed by S√©bastien Candel (President of the Academy), it is one of the five Academies of the Institut de France.  History  A heroic depiction of the activities of the Academy from 1698 The Academy of Sciences traces its origin to Colbert's plan to create a general academy. He chose a small group of scholars who met on 22 December 1666 in the King's library, near the present-day Biblioth√®que Nationals, and thereafter held twice-weekly working meetings there in the two rooms assigned to the group. The first 30 years of the Academy's existence were relatively informal, since no statutes had as yet been laid down for the institution. In contrast to its British counterpart, the Academy was founded as an organ of government. In Paris, there weren't many membership openings, to fill positions there were tenacious elections. The election process was at least a 6-stage process with rules and regulations that allowed for chosen candidates to canvas other members and for current members to consider postponing certain stages of the process if the need would arise. Elections in the early days of the academy were important activities, and as such made up a large part of the proceedings at the academy, with many meetings being held regarding the election to fill a single vacancy within the academy. That is not to say that discussion of candidates and the election process as a whole was relegated to the meetings. Members that belonged to the vacancy's respective field would continue discussion of potential candidates for the vacancy in private. Being elected into the Academy didn't necessarily guarantee being a full member, in some cases, one would enter the academy as an associate or correspondent before being appointed as a full member of the academy. The election process was originally only to replace members from a specific section, for example, if someone whose study was mathematics was either removed or resigned from his position, the following election process nominated only those whose focus was also mathematics in order to fill that discipline's vacancy. This led to some periods of time where they couldn't find specialists for specific fields of study, and had to have positions in those fields vacant, unable to fill them with people in other disciplines. But after reform in 1987, the academy decided against the practice, favoring filling vacancies with people with new disciplines. This reform was not only aimed at further diversifying the disciplines under the academy, but also to help combat the internal aging of the academy itself. The Academy was expected to remain apolitical, and to avoid discussion of religious and social issues. Louis XIV Visiting the Royal Academy of Sciences, (S√©bastien Leclerc I, France, 1671) On 20 January 1699, Louis XIV gave the Company its first rules. The Academy received the name of Royal Academy of Sciences and was installed in the Louvre in Paris. Following this reform, the Academy began publishing a volume each year with information on all the work done by its members and obituaries for members who had died. This reform also codified the method by which members of the Academy could receive pensions for their work. The academy was originally organized by the royal reform hierarchically into the following groups: Pensionaires, Pupils, Honoraires, and Associ√©s. The reform also added new groups not previously recognized, such as V√©t√©ran. Some of these role's member limits were expanded and some roles even removed or combined throughout the course of academy's history. The Honoraires group establish by this reform in 1699 whose members were directly appointed by the King was recognized until its abolishment in 1793. Membership in the academy only exceeded 100 officially recognized full members in 1976, 310 years after the academy's inception in 1666. The membership increase came with a large- scale reorganization in 1976. Under this reorganization, 130 resident members, 160 correspondents, and 80 foreign associates could be elected. A vacancy only opens upon the death of a member, as they serve for life. During elections, half of the vacancies are reserved for people less than 55 years old. This was created as an attempt to encourage younger members to join the academy. The reorganization also divided the academy into 2 divisions. One division covers the applications of mathematics and physical sciences, and the other covers the applications of chemical, natural, biological, and medical sciences. On 8 August 1793, the National Convention abolished all the academies. On 22 August 1795, a National Institute of Sciences and Arts was put in place, bringing together the old academies of the sciences, literature and arts, among them the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise and the Acad√©mie des sciences. Also in 1795, The Academy determined these 10 titles to be their newly accepted branches of scientific study: # Mathematics # Mechanics # Astronomy # Physics # Chemistry # Mineralogy # Botony # Agriculture # Anatomy and Zoology # Medicine and Surgery The last two sections are bundled since there were many good candidates fit to be elected for those practices, and the competition was stiff. Some individuals like Francois Magendie had made stellar advancements in their selected fields of study, that warranted a possible addition of new fields. However, even someone like Magendie that had made breakthroughs in Physiology and impressed the Academy with his hands-on vivisection experiments, could not get his study into its own category. Despite Magendie being one of the leading innovators of his time, it was still a battle for him to become an official member of the Academy, a feat he would later accomplish in 1821. He further improved the reverence of the academy when he and anatomist Charles Bell produced the widely known \\"Bell-Magendie Law\\". From 1795 until 1914, the first world war, the French Academy of Science was the most prevalent organization of French science. Almost all the old members of the previously abolished Acad√©mie were formally re-elected and retook their ancient seats. Among the exceptions was Dominique, comte de Cassini, who refused to take his seat. Membership in the Academy was not restricted to scientists: in 1798 Napoleon Bonaparte was elected a member of the Academy and three years later a president in connection with his Egyptian expedition, which had a scientific component. In 1816, the again renamed \\"Royal Academy of Sciences\\" became autonomous, while forming part of the Institute of France; the head of State became its patron. In the Second Republic, the name returned to Acad√©mie des sciences. During this period, the Academy was funded by and accountable to the Ministry of Public Instruction. The Academy came to control French patent laws in the course of the eighteenth century, acting as the liaison of artisans' knowledge to the public domain. As a result, academicians dominated technological activities in France. The Academy proceedings were published under the name Comptes rendus de l'Acad√©mie des Sciences (1835‚Äì1965). The Comptes rendus is now a journal series with seven titles. The publications can be found on site of the French National Library. In 1818 the French Academy of Sciences launched a competition to explain the properties of light. The civil engineer Augustin-Jean Fresnel entered this competition by submitting a new wave theory of light. Sim√©on Denis Poisson, one of the members of the judging committee, studied Fresnel's theory in detail. Being a supporter of the particle-theory of light, he looked for a way to disprove it. Poisson thought that he had found a flaw when he demonstrate that Fresnel's theory predicts that an on-axis bright spot would exist in the shadow of a circular obstacle, where there should be complete darkness according to the particle-theory of light. The Poisson spot is not easily observed in every-day situations, so it was only natural for Poisson to interpret it as an absurd result and that it should disprove Fresnel's theory. However, the head of the committee, Dominique-Fran√ßois-Jean Arago, and who incidentally later became Prime Minister of France, decided to perform the experiment in more detail. He molded a 2-mm metallic disk to a glass plate with wax. To everyone's surprise he succeeded in observing the predicted spot, which convinced most scientists of the wave-nature of light. Illustration from Acta Eruditorum (1737) where was published Machines et inventions approuv√©es par l'Academie Royale des Sciences For three centuries women were not allowed as members of the Academy. This meant that many women scientists were excluded, including two-time Nobel Prize winner Marie Curie, Nobel winner Ir√®ne Joliot-Curie, mathematician Sophie Germain, and many other deserving women scientists. The first woman admitted as a correspondent member was a student of Curie's, Marguerite Perey, in 1962. The first female full member was Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat in 1979. Membership in the academy is highly geared towards representing common French populace demographics. French population increases and changes in the early 21st century led to the academy expanding reference population sizes by reform in the early 2002. The overwhelming majority of members leave the academy posthumously, with a few exceptions of removals, transfers, and resignations. The last member to be removed from the academy was in 1944. Removal from the academy was often for not performing to standards, not performing at all, leaving the country, or political reasons. In some rare occasions, a member has been elected twice and subsequently removed twice. This is the case for Marie-Adolphe Carnot.  Government interference  The most direct involvement of the government in the affairs of the institute came in the initial nomination of members in 1795. But as the members nominated constituted only one-third of the membership and most of these had previously been elected as members of the respective Academies under the old regime, few objections were raised. Moreover, these nominated members were then completely free to nominate the remaining members of the institute. Members expected to remain such for life, but interference occurred in a few cases where the government suddenly terminated membership for political reasons. The other main interference came when the government refused to accept the result of Academy elections. The academies control by the government was apparent in 1803, when Bonaparte decided on a general reorganization. His principal concern was not the First class but the Second, which included political scientists who were potential critics of his government. Bonaparte abolished the second class completely and, after a few expulsions, redistributed its remaining members, together with those of the Third class, into a new Second class concerned with literature and a new Third class devoted to the fine arts. Still this relationship between the Academy and the government was not a one-way affair, as members expected to receive their payment of an honorarium.  Decline  Although the Academy still exists today, after World War One, the reputation and status of the Academy was largely questioned. One factor of decline was the development from a meritocracy to gerontocracy, in other words; a shift from people with scientific ability leading the Academy to people who had been there longer leading it. It became known as a sort of \\"hall of fame\\" that lost control, real and symbolic, of the professional scientific diversity in France at the time. Another factor was that in the span of five years, 1909 to 1914, funding to science faculties considerably dropped, eventually leading to a financial crisis in France.  Today  The Institut de France in Paris where the Academy is housed Today the Academy is one of five academies comprising the Institut de France. Its members are elected for life. Currently, there are 150 full members, 300 corresponding members, and 120 foreign associates. They are divided into two scientific groups: the Mathematical and Physical sciences and their applications and the Chemical, Biological, Geological and Medical sciences and their applications. The Academy currently has five missions that its pursuing. These being the encouraging of the scientific life, promoting the teaching of science, transmitting knowledge between scientific communities, fostering international collaborations, and ensuring a dual role of expertise and advise. The French Academy of Science originally focused its development efforts into creating a true co-development Euro-African program beginning in 1997. Since then they have broadened their scope of action to other regions of the world. The standing committee COPED is in charge of the international development projects undertaken by the French Academy of Science and their associates. The current president of COPED is Pierre Auger, the vice president is Michel Delseny, and the honorary president is Francois Gros. All of which are current members of the French Academy of Science. COPED has hosted several workshops or colloquia in Paris, involving representatives from African academies, universities or research centers, addressing a variety of themes and challenges dealing with African development and covering a large field spectrum. Specifically higher education in sciences, and research practices in basic and applied sciences that deal with various aspects relevant to development (renewable energy, infectious diseases, animal pathologies, food resources, access to safe water, agriculture, urban health, etc.).  Current committees and working parties  The Academic Standing Committees and Working Parties prepare the advice notes, policy statements and the Academic Reports. Some have a statutory remit, such as the Select Committee, the Committee for International Affairs and the Committee for Scientists' Rights, some are created ad hoc by the Academy and approved formally by vote in a Members-only session.

This species is in length, and has the white-dark-white underwing pattern characteristic of Catharus thrushes. It is a member of a close-knit group of migrant species together with the veery and Bicknell's thrush; it forms a cryptic species pair with the latter. The grey-cheeked thrush is all but indistinguishable from Bicknell's thrush except by its slightly larger size and different song. The two were formerly considered conspecific. Of all the American spotted thrushes, the grey-cheeked has the most northern breeding range. Description The grey-cheeked thrush is slightly larger than other Catharus thrushes, about 16 to in height and weighing between 26 and 30g. Wingspan ranges from 12.6-13.4 in (32-34 cm). The bird can be identified by its grayish face, partial pale eyering, drab gray-brown upperside and extensively dusky flanks. The area between the eye and the beak is grayish as well, but the area running from the beak to above the eye is grayish white. The gray-cheeked thrush is nearly identical to the Bicknell's Thrush. There are two subspecies: the northern grey-cheeked thrush (Catharus minimus alicia), and the Newfoundland grey-cheeked thrush (Catharus minimus minimus). Catharus m. minimus can be distinguished by its overall browner coloration and buffer wash to the breast, compared to the Catharus m. alicia. Catharus m. minimus also has an extensive brighter yellow area at the base of the lower part of the beak. Catharus m. alicia has a grayish olive upperpart (whereas C. m. minimus has a brownish olive upperpart) and flanks, a lightly washed cream breast and duller lower part of the beak. Taxonomy The grey-cheeked thrush is part of the family Turdidae, form the order Passeriformes regrouping the songbirds. The specific name minimus is Latin for \\"smallest\\". In addition to being almost identical physically, the grey-cheeked thrush is sister species to the Bicknell's Thrush (Catharus bicknelli). The divergence of the two species is very recent since only little genetic divergence separate them. Dr. Henri Ouellet was the first to propose the separation between the Bicknell's and the grey-cheeked thrush in 1996. Habitat and distribution The grey- cheeked thrush is a long-distance migrant species with a migration on average of 300 km. They are believed to spend their winter in the Amazon basin and will cross the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico during their spring migration. They are present in their breeding ground from May to August. They breeding range includes the northern boreal forests from Newfoundland to Alaska in North America and across the Bering Sea to Eastern Siberia associated with dense conifer and broadleaf shrub thickets. C. minimus remains uncommon to rare in most regions of North America but can be spotted in any wooded habitat. The breeding range extends north of the treeline into low Arctic willow and alder beds. Grey-cheeked thrushes prefer low coniferous woods, including young regenerating forests, open canopy old growth forests having a dense growth of shrubs and small conifers in the understory, and dense, stunted spruce and fir on windblown sites and near the tree line. The subspecies of C. minimus are also separated by their different breeding ranges: Catharus m. alicia breeds from Labrador west to Siberia, and Catharus m. minimus breeds on the island of Newfoundland and possibly adjacent portions of southern coastal Labrador.  Behavior  = Vocalizations = The vocalizations of the grey-cheeked thrush are the most reliable way to identify it, compared to the Bicknell's Thrush. It has a complex song of burry flute- like notes, usually inflecting downward at the end. It resembles a descending spiral like the Veery (Catharus fuscescens), but higher, thinner, and nasal with stuttering pauses: \\"ch-ch zreeew zi-zi-zreeee zizreeew\\". The flight call is a high, penetrating, nasal \\"queer\\". It is more likely to hear its nocturnal flight call during spring and fall migration than to observe the species on the ground. The nocturnal flight note a one or two note \\"whe-eer\\" dropping in pitch. = Diet = C. minimus consumes mainly insects, such as beetles, weevils, ants, wasps, and caterpillars, in addition to arachnids as well as fruits and berries (wild cherries, blackberries, and raspberries). It also feeds on crayfish, sow bugs, and earthworms. Their habits of eating berries contribute to the dispersion of seeds. = Reproduction = C. minimus exhibits secretive behaviour during breeding season, and nesting pairs are rarely found in high densities as their territories are well-spaced. They build their nests on the ground or in low shrubs, typically less than 2 meters high. Females build the nest with dried grasses mixed with a supporting layer of mud. There is only one brood per season, although they will lay a second brood if the first nest fails early in the season. There is an average of 4 eggs per nest, but it may vary between 3 and 5 eggs. The female incubates the eggs for 13 to 14 days. The eggs are greenish blue, marked with light brown dots and oval to short oval in shape. Nestlings fledge 11 to 13 days after hatching and the young are cared for by both parents. Individuals breed at one year of age and are presumed monogamous.

Blake. Biography Her father, Theodore Quarles Srygley, was an educator and her mother, Grace Stumpe Srygley, was a psychologist. She married an investor, Jackson, C. Mouton, Jr. on December 22, 1953. The Moutons had two daughters named Jane Martha and Jacquelyn Cruse. Jane Srygley Mouton received her Bachelor of Science in Mathematical Education from the University of Texas at Austin in 1950 and later returned to complete a PhD in 1957 (Contemporary, 2004). She also received a Masters of Science from Florida State University in 1951. She was loyal to the University of Texas at Austin with her working positions including being a research scientist from 1953‚Äì1957, a social science researcher and instructor from 1957‚Äì1959, and assistant professor of psychology from 1959-1964. She was furthermore vice-president of Scientific Methods Inc. from 1961‚Äì1981 and has presided as president of the company since 1982. Mouton was a former student of Robert Blake from the University of Texas. Together they are known for their creation of the aforementioned Managerial Grid which was admittedly composed of Mouton‚Äôs creation and Blake‚Äôs name (Bokeno, 2007). The Grid came into existence when Blake and Mouton were hired as consultants by Exxon. It was during this time that their supposedly combined efforts produced the grid as a method of finding a median between McGregor‚Äôs Theory X and Theory Y workers (Capstone, 2003). Originally, their work was reflected upon the National Training Laboratories (NTL) who they had worked with as a means of bringing their ideas into the organizations (Kleiner, 1996). Mouton was among the few women to lead one of the NTL‚Äôs T-Groups (Training Groups) during the 1950s. However, Blake and Mouton‚Äôs methodology was more focused on treating the organizational issues rather than simply diagnosing them. This was contrary to standard NTL practices. Thus, they separated from the company. Blake had copyrighted the Grid so that only by franchising with him could someone else use the Grid for training, thus ensuring that everyone would use it in the way Blake and Mouton deemed fitting. Therefore, through their work with NTL leading T-Group‚Äôs and the creation of Mouton‚Äôs Managerial Grid, Blake and Mouton became famous, eventually co-founding Scientific Methods, Inc. in 1961 (Ultimate, 2003). =Honors= *Honorary member of the faculty at the Institute of Business Administration and Management in Tokyo, Japan *Best Writing Award from the American Society for Training and Development (1961‚Äì1962) *Book Award from the American College of Hospital Administrators for The New Managerial Grid (1980) *Book of the Year Award from the American Journal of Nursing (1982) for Grid Approaches for Managerial Leadership in Nursing *Book of the Year Award from the American Management Association (1982) for Productivity: The Human Side References *Bokeno, M.

Since the 1960s, Waldman has been an active member of the Outrider experimental poetry community as a writer, performer, collaborator, professor, editor, scholar, and cultural/political activist. She has also been connected to the Beat poets. Life and work Born in Millville, New Jersey, Waldman was raised on MacDougal Street in New York City's Greenwich Village, and received her B.A. from Bennington College in 1966. During the 1960s, Waldman became part of the East Coast poetry scene, in part through her engagement with the poets and artists loosely termed the Second Generation of the New York School. During this time, Waldman also made many connections with earlier generations of poets, including figures such as Allen Ginsberg, who once called Waldman his \\"spiritual wife.\\" From 1966‚Äì1968, she served as Assistant Director of the Poetry Project at St. Mark's; and, from 1968‚Äì1978, she served as the Project's Director. In the early 1960s, Waldman became a student of Buddhism. In the 1970s, along with Allen Ginsberg, she began to study with the Tibetan Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche. While attending the Berkeley Poetry Conference in 1965, Waldman, with poet Lewis Warsh, was inspired to found Angel Hair, a small press that produced a magazine of the same name and a number of smaller books. It was while she was attending this conference that she first committed to poetry after hearing the Outrider poets. In 1974, with Trungpa, Ginsberg, and others, Waldman founded the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at the Naropa Institute in Boulder, Colorado (now Naropa University), where she remains a Distinguished Professor of Poetics and the Director of Naropa's celebrated Summer Writing Program. In 1976, Waldman and Ginsberg were featured in Bob Dylan's film, Renaldo and Clara. They worked on the film while traveling through New England and Canada with the Rolling Thunder Revue, a concert tour that made impromptu stops, entertaining enthusiastic crowds with poetry and music. Waldman, Ginsberg, and Dylan were joined on these caravans by musicians such as Joan Baez, Joni Mitchell, Eric Anderson, and Joe Cocker. Waldman reveled in the experience, and she often thought of recreating the poetry caravan. Waldman married Reed Bye in 1980, and their son, Edwin Ambrose Bye was born on October 21, 1980. The birth of her son proved to be an \\"inspiring turning point\\" for Waldman, and she became interested in and committed to the survival of the planet. Her child, she said, became her teacher. Waldman and Ambrose Bye perform frequently, and the two have created Fast Speaking Music and have produced multiple albums together. Waldman has been a fervent activist for social change. In the 1970s, she was involved with the Rocky Flats Truth Force, an organization opposed to the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons facility ten miles to the south of Boulder, Colorado. With Daniel Ellsberg and Allen Ginsberg, she was arrested for protesting outside of the site. She has been a vocal proponent for feminist, environmental, and human rights causes; an active participant in Poets Against the War; and she has helped organize protests in New York and Washington, D.C. Waldman says that her life's work is to \\"keep the world safe for poetry.\\" Although her work is sometimes connected to the Beat Generation, Waldman has never been, strictly speaking, a \\"Beat\\" poet. Her work, like the work of her contemporaries in the 1970s New York milieu of which she was a vital part‚Äîwriters like Alice Notley and Bernadette Mayer, to name only two‚Äîis more diverse in its influences and ambitions. Waldman is particularly interested in the performance of her poetry: she considers performance a \\"ritualized event in time,\\" and she expresses the energy of her poetry through exuberant breathing, chanting, singing, and movement. Waldman credits her poem, Fast Speaking Woman, as the seminal work that galvanized her idea of poetry as performance. Ginsberg, Kenneth Koch, Lawrence Ferlinghetti - all encouraged her to continue to perform her poetry. Waldman has been quoted, describing growing up in Greenwich Village in the early sixties, ‚Äúwe benefited from the trials of young women who had struggled to be creative and assertive before us, and we were certainly aware of the exciting artistic and liberal heritage of our New York environs and yet many of us fell into the same retrograde traps. Being dominated by relationships with men‚Äî letting our own talents lag, following their lead ‚Äî which could really result in drug dependencies, painful abortions, alienation from family and friends‚Ä¶ I knew interesting and creative women who became junkies for their boyfriends, who stole for their boyfriends, who concealed their poetry and artistic aspirations, who slept around to be popular, who had serious eating disorders, who concealed their unwanted pregnancies raising money for abortions on their own, who put the child up for adoption, who never felt like they owned and appreciated their bodies. I knew women who lived secret or double lives because love and sexual attraction to another woman was an anathema. I knew women in daily therapy because their fathers had abused them, or women who got sent away to mental hospitals or special schools because they'd taken a black lover. Some ran away from home. Some committed suicide.‚Äù https://www.jstor.org/stable/4022670?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents Waldman has published more than forty books of poetry. Her work has been widely anthologized, featuring work in Breaking the Cool (University of Mississippi Press, 2004), All Poets Welcome (University of California Press, Berkeley, CA, 2003), Women of the Beat Generation (Conari Press, Berkeley, CA, 1996), Postmodern American Poetry (W.W. Norton, New York, 1994) and Up Late (Four Walls Eight Windows, New York, 1988) among others. Her poems have been translated into French, Italian, German, Turkish, Spanish, and Chinese. Waldman is also the editor of several volumes relating to modern, postmodern, and contemporary poetry. Over the course of her career, Waldman has also been a tireless collaborator, producing works with artists Elizabeth Murray, Richard Tuttle, Meredith Monk, George Schneeman, Donna Dennis, Pat Steir; musicians Don Cherry, Laurie Anderson, and Steve Lacy; dancer Douglas Dunn; filmmaker and husband Ed Bowes; and her son, musician/composer Ambrose Bye. Waldman has been a Fellow at the Emily Harvey Foundation (Winter 2008) and the Bellagio Center in Italy (Spring 2006). She has also held residencies at the Christian Woman's University of Tokyo (Fall 2004); the Schule f√ºr Dichtung in Vienna (where she has also served as Curriculum Director in 1989); the Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe, New Mexico; and the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey (1984). She has served as an advisor to the Prazska Skola Projekt in Prague, the Study Abroad on the Bowery (since 2004), and has been a faculty member in the New England College Low Residency MFA Program (since 2003). She is the recipient of grants from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the Contemporary Artists Foundation, and the Poetry Foundation. With writer and scholar Ammiel Alcalay, she founded the Poetry Is News Coalition in 2002. Waldman also won the International Poetry Championship Bout in Taos, New Mexico twice. In 2011, Waldman was elected a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets. Her archive of historical, literary, art, tape, and extensive correspondence materials (including many prominent literary correspondents, such as: William S. Burroughs, Robert Creeley, Diane Di Prima, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Allen Ginsberg, and Ken Kesey) resides at the University of Michigan's Special Collections Library in Ann Arbor, Michigan.Anne Waldman Papers, 1945-2002, University of Michigan, Special Collections Library A 55-minute film titled ‚ÄúAnne Waldman: Makeup on Empty Space,‚Äù a film by poet Jim Cohn, documents the opening of the Anne Waldman Collection at the University of Michigan. In an interview with \\"The Wire\\" from the Jaipur Literature Festival in 2017, Waldman was asked about the way her poetry crosses forms and incorporates songs and chants, and how she develops this type of poem. She said, \\"I've always been interested in a bigger form, one that doesn't just rest quietly on the page. The performative quality is there because there needs to be an extra emphasis. Rather than reading quietly, I feel the physical need to do something bigger. I don't walk around as an angry person all the time, but there are different states of minds. Like in Hinduism, the gods and goddesses embody different states of being and experience. That's the idea. Then, some things are written for protest. They have the need to arise.\\" Works =Books and pamphlets= * Trickster Feminism, Penguin Books, 2018 * Extinction Aria, Pied Oxen, 2017 * Voice's Daughter of a Heart Yet to be Born, Coffee House Press, 2016 * Dream Book of Fez, The Lune, 2016 * Empty Set, Overpass Books, 2016 * The Iovis Trilogy, Coffee House Press, 2011 * Manatee/Humanity, Penguin Poets, 2009 * Red Noir (performance pieces) Farfalla, McMillen, Parrish, 2007 * Outrider, La Alameda Press, 2006 * Structure of the World Compared to a Bubble, Penguin Poets, 2004. * In the Room of Never Grieve: New & Selected Poems 1985‚Äì2003, Coffee House Press, 2003. * Dark Arcana / Afterimage or Glow, Heaven Bone Press, 2003. * [Things] Seen Unseen, 2002. * War Crime, Elik Press, 2002. * Vow to Poetry: Essays, Interviews, & Manifestos, Coffee House Press, 2001. * Marriage: A Sentence, Penguin Poets, 2000. * Iovis II, Coffee House Press, 1997. * Fast Speaking Woman, 20th Anniversary Edition, City Lights Books, 1996. * Kill or Cure, Penguin Poets, 1996. * lovis: All Is Full of Jove, Coffee House Press, 1993. * Troubairitz, Fifth Planet Press, 1993. * Fait Accompli, Last Generation Press, 1992. * Lokapala, Rocky Ledge, 1991. * Not a Male Pseudonym, Tender Buttons Books, 1990. * Helping the Dreamer: New and Selected Poems: 1966‚Äì1988, Coffee House Press, 1989. * Tell Me About It, Bloody Twin Press, 1989. * The Romance Thing, Bamberger Books, 1987. * Blue Mosque, United Artists, 1987. * Skin Meat Bones, Coffee House Press, 1985. * Makeup on Empty Space, Toothpaste Press, 1984. * First Baby Poems, Rocky Ledge, 1982, augmented edition, Hyacinth Girls, 1983, republished, BlazeVOX Books, 2008. * Cabin, Z Press, 1981. * Countries, Toothpaste Press, 1980. * To a Young Poet, White Raven, 1979. * Shaman / Shamane, White Raven, 1977. * Hotel Room, Songbird, 1976. * Journals and Dreams, Stonehill, 1976. * Fast Speaking Woman and Other Chants, City Lights, 1975 (revised edition, 1978). * Sun the Blonde Out, Arif, 1975. * Dance Song, No Mountains Poetry Project Broadside Series, 1975 * Fast Speaking Woman, Red Hanrahan Press, 1974. * The Contemplative Life, Alternative Press, c. 1974. * Life Notes: Selected Poems, Bobbs-Merrill, 1973. * The West Indies Poems, Adventures in Poetry, 1972. * Spin Off, Big Sky, 1972. * Light and Shadow, Privately printed, 1972. * Holy City, privately printed, 1971. * No Hassles, Kulchur Foundation, 1971. * Icy Rose, Angel Hair, 1971. * Baby Breakdown, Bobbs-Merrill, 1970. * Giant Night: Selected Poems, Corinth Books, 1970. * Up Through the Years, Angel Hair, 1970. * O My Life!, Angel Hair, 1969. * On the Wing, Boke, 1968. =Poetry collaborations= * Empty Set: a Universe of Discourse, (with Alexis Myre), Overpass Books, 2016. * Fukushima Mon Amour, (with Daniel de Roulet, Sylvia Federici, George Caffentzis, & Sabu Kohso), Autonomedia, 2011. * The Belladonna Elders Series (with Cara Benson & Jayne Cortez), Belladonna*, 2009. * Fleuve Fl√¢neur (with Mary Kite), Erudite Fangs, 2004. * Zombie Dawn (with Tom Clark), Skanky Possum Press, 2003. * Ai Lit / Holy (with Eleni Sikelianos & Laird Hunt), 2001. * Young Manhattan (with Bill Berkson), Smoke Proof Press, 1999. * Polemics (with Anselm Hollo & Jack Collom), Autonomedia, 1998. * Polar Ode (With Eileen Myles), Dead Duke, 1979. * Four Travels (With Reed Bye), Sayonara, 1979. * Sphinxeries (With Denyse duRoi), 1979. * Self Portrait (With Joe Brainard), Siamese Banana Press, 1973. * Memorial Day (With Ted Berrigan), Poetry Project, 1971. =Audio recordings= * Harry's House, Volume 3 (compilation), Fast Speaking Music, 2015. * Ghost Dance, (Anne Waldman, Thurston Moore, Ambrose Bye -

The naming of United States Navy vessels after living people was common in early decades of American history, but by World War II, the Navy had firmly established a practice of naming ships for people only after they had died. In 1969, a Navy panel decreed that warships would no longer be named after living persons. That lasted until 1974, when President Richard Nixon announced the naming of an aircraft carrier after United States Representative Carl Vinson. Since then, ships such as the , , , , , and have been named for people still alive at the time. The U.S. Navy generally announces the name of a ship some time before it is launched, and well before it is accepted for purchase and commissioned into active service.

The university can trace its origins to the Liverpool Mechanics' School of Arts, established in 1823. This later merged to become Liverpool Polytechnic. In 1992, following an Act of Parliament, the Liverpool Polytechnic became what is now Liverpool John Moores University. It is named after Sir John Moores, a local businessman and philanthropist, who donated to the university's precursor institutions. The university had students in , of which are undergraduate students and are postgraduate, making it the largest university in the UK by total student population. It is a member of the University Alliance, the Northern Consortium and the European University Association.  History  = Origins = Founded as a small mechanics institution (Liverpool Mechanics' School of Arts) in 1823, the institution grew over the centuries by converging and amalgamating with different colleges, including the F.L.Calder School of Domestic Science, the City of Liverpool C.F. Mott Training College, before eventually becoming Liverpool Polytechnic in 1970. The University also has a long history of providing training, education and research to the maritime industry, dating back to the formation of the Liverpool Nautical College in 1892. The institution then became a university under the terms of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 under the new title of \\"Liverpool John Moores University\\". This new title was approved by the Privy Council on 15 September 1992. The university took its name from Sir John Moores, the founder of the Littlewoods empire. Moores was a great believer in the creation of opportunity for all, which embodies the ethos of LJMU in providing educational routes for people of all ages and from all backgrounds. This belief led Sir John Moores to invest in the institution and facilities, such as the John Foster Building (housing the Liverpool Business School), designed by and named after leading architect John Foster. With the institution's backgrounds dating back as far as 1823, many of the university buildings date back also, with aesthetically pleasing Georgian and Victorian buildings found on a few of the campuses. = Present day = The James Parsons Building at LJMU's City Campus LJMU now has more than 24,000 students from over 100 countries world-wide, 2,400 staff and 250 degree courses.https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/about-us/about-liverpool-john-moores- university LJMU was awarded the Queen's Anniversary Prize in 2005. Currently, Liverpool John Moores University is receiving more applications than previously seen; according to data in 2009, the total number of applications submitted to LJMU was 27,784. On 14 April 2008, Brian May was inducted into the university as the fourth Chancellor of Liverpool John Moores University. May is also the lead guitarist for the rock band Queen. He replaced outgoing Chancellor Cherie Booth QC, wife of former Prime Minister Tony Blair. Honorary fellows in attendance at the ceremony included Sir Patrick Moore and Pete Postlethwaite. May was succeeded as Chancellor in 2013 by Sir Brian Leveson. LJMU is a founding member of the Northern Consortium, an educational charity, owned by eleven universities in the north of England.  Campuses  The university is based primarily on three campuses: * City Campus, housing buildings from many faculties in and around Liverpool city centre * Mount Pleasant Campus, in the city centre, home to the faculty of Business and Law * I M Marsh Campus, in Aigburth housing the Education, Community and Leisure faculty = Libraries = Aldham Robarts LRC as viewed from Mount Pleasant gardens There are currently three libraries based at the three campus sites operated by LJMU. The two largest and more modern LRC facilities are the Avril Robarts library which is based on the City campus and used mainly (but not exclusively) by students studying on the city campus, in particular the Byrom Street and Marybone students. The Aldham Robarts LRC (which is based on the Mount Pleasant campus) is used mainly by students at the Mount Pleasant campus, this campus includes the faculty of Business and Law but student based closely to the LRC on a range of courses also use this facility. The third LRC is sited on the IM Marsh campus in Aigburth and is used exclusively (due to location outside the City centre) by students at this campus, and is the only library not to offer 24hr support and has a period students are unable to withdraw books due to Christmas holidays. There are more than 68,500 books in the LRCs' collections, with 1,630 work spaces available for students 24 hours a day. In addition to this there are over 16,000 e-books and 5,000 e-journals available. It is a member of the Libraries Together: Liverpool Learning Partnership (evolved from Liverpool Libraries Group) which formed in 1990. Under which, a registered reader at any of the member libraries can have access rights to the other libraries within the partnership. The Aldham Robarts library is situated on Maryland Street at the heart of the Mount Pleasant Campus and right opposite the Students' Union, Aldham Robarts caters mainly for the Faculty of Business and Law and the Faculty of Media, Arts and Social Science. Avril Robarts Library is located on Tithebarn Street on City Campus, and covers three faculties: Faculty of Health and Applied Social Sciences, the Faculty of Science and the Faculty of Technology and Environment, IM Marsh Campus library services the IM Marsh campus at Aigburth and covers the Faculty of Education, Community and Leisure which is situated at this site. =Tom Reilly Building= The Tom Reilly Building houses the School of Sports and Exercise Sciences and the School of Natural Sciences and Psychology, which are both part of the Faculty of Science. Some 8,000 students use the building which is located at LJMU's City Campus on Byrom Street. The five storey, building was completed in November 2009 and opened in March 2010 by Liverpool F.C. captain Steven Gerrard. The building provides sports and science facilities including; appetite laboratories, psychology testing labs, neuroscience labs, an indoor 70-metre running track, force plates, caren disc, physiology suites, a DEXA scanner, a driving simulator and a chronobiology lab. Organisation and structure = Faculties = Liverpool Business School Liverpool School of Art and Design School of Natural Sciences and Psychology The university is organised into five faculties (which are each split into schools or centres), most of the faculties are based at a particular campus site however, with many joint honours degrees and some conventional degrees, the faculties overlap meaning students' degrees are from both faculties. The five faculties are: ; Faculty of Business & Law * Liverpool Business School * School of Law ; Faculty of Arts, Professional and Social Studies * Liverpool School of Art and Design * Liverpool Screen School * School of Education * School of Humanities and Social Science * School of Justice Studies * Institute of Culture Capital ;Faculty of Health * School of Nursing and Allied Health * Public Health Institute ;Faculty of Science * School of Natural Sciences and Psychology * School of Pharmacy and Biomolecular Sciences * School of Sport and Exercise Sciences ; Faculty of Engineering and Technology * Astrophysics Research Institute * Department of Applied Mathematics * Department of the Built Environment * Department of Civil Engineering * Department of Computer Science * Department of Electronics and Electronic Engineering * Department of Maritime and Mechanical Engineering * LJMU Maritime Centre * Centre for Entrepreneurship =Governance= Academic profile LJMU is highly ranked for teaching and research in Sports and Exercise Sciences. The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) awarded LJMU ¬£4.5 million over five years for the establishment of a Centre for Excellence in Teaching and Learning (CETL). The CETL award recognises LJMU's record for Physical Education, Dance, Sport and Exercises Sciences. LJMU is the only United Kingdom university to be awarded an Ofsted Grade A in Physical Education and it is also the premier institution for both teaching and research in Sport and Exercise Sciences. =Business School= Liverpool Business School (LBS) is located in the Redmonds Building on the Mount Pleasant Campus and has over 2,500 students and 100 academics. LBS offers undergraduate, postgraduate (including an Executive MBA) and research based programmes. Research areas include International Banking, Economics and Finance, Sustainable Enterprise, Public Service Management, Development of Modern Economic Thought, Performance Management, Marketing, Project Management, and Market Research. = Research = Mount Pleasant Campus Centre In the 2001 Research Assessment Exercise (RAE), LJMU reported notable research strengths in general engineering and sports-related sciences. By the 2008 RAE, LJMU was the top-performing post-92 university for Anthropology, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, General Engineering, Physics (Astrophysics) and Sports-Related Studies. According to the UK Research Assessment Exercise 2014 (RAE 2014), LJMU every unit of assessment submitted was rated as at least 45% internationally excellent or better. In 2012, the university's scientist published notable research suggesting that the dinosaur's extinction may have been caused by increased methane production from the dinosaurs, with some informally saying that dinosaurs \\"farted\\" their way to extinction. = Rankings = Liverpool John Moores University was included in the new 2013 Times Higher Education 100 under 50, ranking 72 out of 100. The list aims to show the rising stars in the global academy under the age of 50 years. First Destination Survey results show that 89% of LJMU graduates are in employment or undertaking postgraduate study within six months of graduating. Student life = Students' Union = Students at the University are represented, if not supported by, the Liverpool Students' Union. Representation for all students is central and is conducted by executive officers elected annually. In most cases, these students will be on a sabbatical from their studies. The election process is normally contested in mid April, successful candidates assuming office the following academic year. = Sports = I M Marsh Campus' swimming pool and sports hall Liverpool John Moores University has BUCS- registered teams in badminton, basketball, cricket, football, cycling, hockey, netball, rugby league, rugby union, tennis, volleyball, swimming and American football. Many of the sports teams compete in BUCS competitions. Liverpool Students' Union has 15 BUCS sports, from which 36 teams run, catering for over 800 athletes. In recent years, LJMU students have competed for BUCS representative squads, in national finals and at World University Championships. In addition, the Students' Union also runs intramural sports leagues. LJMU Fury, American football team The University also enjoys success at National and World level. Gymnast Beth Tweddle studied at LJMU and has achieved national, Commonwealth, European and World medals whilst also competing at the Olympic Games.

A row of chakras is depicted from the base of the spine up to the crown of the head. A subtle body ( ,IAST:) is one of a series of psycho- spiritual constituents of living beings, according to various esoteric, occult, and mystical teachings. According to such beliefs each subtle body corresponds to a subtle plane of existence, in a hierarchy or great chain of being that culminates in the physical form. The subtle body consists of focal points, often called chakras, connected by channels, often called nadis, that convey subtle breath (with names such as prana or vayu). These are understood to determine the characteristics of the physical body. Through breathing and other exercises, a practitioner may direct the subtle breath to achieve supernormal powers, immortality, or liberation. The subtle body (Sanskrit: s≈´k·π£ma ≈õarƒ´ra) is important in Indian religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, mainly in the forms which focus on tantra and yoga. Other spiritual traditions teach about a mystical or divine body. Asian religions The Yogic, Tantric and other systems of Hinduism, Vajrayana Buddhism, as well as Chinese Taoist alchemy contain theories of subtle physiology with focal points (chakras, acupuncture points) connected by a series of channels (nadis, meridians) that convey subtle breath (prana, vayu, ch'i, ki, lung). These invisible channels and points are understood to determine the characteristics of the visible physical form. By understanding and mastering the subtlest levels of reality one gains mastery over the physical realm. Through breathing and other exercises, the practitioner aims to manipulate and direct the flow of subtle breath, to achieve supernormal powers (siddhis) and attain higher states of consciousness, immortality, or liberation. = Hinduism = An illustration of a subtle body system of seven chakras connected by three major nadi channels, as commonly adopted by contemporary yoga  Early  Early concepts of the subtle body (Sanskrit: s≈´k·π£ma ≈õarƒ´ra) appeared in the Upanishads, including the Brhadaranyaka Upanishad and the Katha Upanishad. The Taittiriya Upanishad describes the theory of five koshas or sheaths, though these are not to be thought of as concentric layers, but interpenetrating at successive levels of subtlety: * The anna-maya (\\"food body\\", physical body, the grossest level), * The prana-maya (body made of vital breath or prana), * The mano-maya (body made of mind), * The vij√±ana-maya (body made of consciousness) * The ananda-maya (bliss body, the subtlest level). Subtle internal anatomy included a central channel (nadi). In later Vedic texts called samhitas and brahmanas one also finds a theory of five \\"winds\\" or \\"breaths\\" (vayus, pranas): * PrƒÅ·πáa, associated with inhalation * ApƒÅna, associated with exhalation * U·∏çƒÅna, associated with distribution of breath within the body * SamƒÅna, associated with digestion * VyƒÅna, associated with excretion of waste  Later  A millennium later, these concepts were adapted and refined by various spiritual traditions. The similar concept of the is seen as the vehicle of consciousness in later Samkhya, Vedanta, and Yoga, and is propelled by past-life tendencies, or bhavas. Linga can be translated as \\"characteristic mark\\" or \\"impermanence\\" and the Vedanta term sarira as \\"form\\" or \\"mold\\".Purucker, Gottfried. The Occult Glossary Karana or \\"instrument\\" is a synonymous term. In the Classical Samkhya system of Isvarakrsna (ca. 4th century CE), the Li≈Ñga is the characteristic mark of the transmigrating entity. It consists of twenty-five tattvas from eternal consciousness down to the five organs of sense, five of activity (buddindriya or j√±ƒÅnendriya, and karmendriya respectively) and the five subtle elements that are the objects of sense (tanmatras) The Samkhyakarika says: The classical Vedanta tradition developed the theory of the five bodies into the theory of the koshas \\"sheaths\\" or \\"coverings\\" which surround and obscure the self (atman). In classical Vedanta these are seen as obstacles to realization and traditions like Shankara's Advaita Vedanta had little interest in working with the subtle body.  Tantra  In Tantra traditions meanwhile (Shaiva Kaula, Kashmir Shaivism and Buddhist Vajrayana), the subtle body was seen in a more positive light, offering potential for yogic practices which could lead to liberation. Tantric traditions contain the most complex theories of the subtle body, with sophisticated descriptions of energy nadis (literally \\"stream or river\\", channels through which vayu and prana flows) and chakras, points of focus where nadis meet. The main channels, shared by both Hindu and Buddhist systems, but visualised entirely differently, are the central (in Hindu systems: sushumna; in Buddhist: avadhuti), left and right (in Hindu systems: ida and pingala; Buddhist: lalana and rasana). Further subsidiary channels are said to radiate outwards from the chakras, where the main channels meet. Chakra systems vary with the tantra; the Netra Tantra describes six chakras, the Kaulaj√±ana-nirnaya describes eight, and the Kubjikamata Tantra describes seven (the most widely known set).  Modern  The modern Indian spiritual teacher Meher Baba stated that the subtle body \\"is the vehicle of desires and vital forces\\". He held that the subtle body is one of three bodies with which the soul must cease to identify in order to realize God. =Buddhism= A Tibetan illustration of the subtle body showing the central channel and two side channels connecting five chakras In Buddhist Tantra, the subtle body is termed the ‚Äòinnate body‚Äô (nija-deha) or the ‚Äòuncommon means body‚Äô (asadhdrana-upayadeha). It is also called s≈´k·π£ma ≈õarƒ´ra, rendered in Tibetan as traway-lu (transliterated phra ba‚Äôi lus). The subtle body consists of thousands of subtle energy channels (nadis), which are conduits for energies or \\"winds\\" (lung or prana) and converge at chakras. According to Dagsay Tulku Rinpoche, there are three main channels (nadis), central, left and right, which run from the point between the eyebrows up to the crown chakra, and down through all seven chakras to a point two inches below the navel. Buddhist tantras generally describe four or five chakras in the shape of a lotus with varying petals. For example, the Hevajra Tantra (8th century) states: > In the Center [i.e. chakra] of Creation [at the sexual organ] a sixty-four > petal lotus. In the Center of Essential Nature [at the heart] an eight petal > lotus. In the Center of Enjoyment [at the throat] a sixteen petal lotus. In > the Center of Great Bliss [at the top of the head] a thirty-two petal lotus. In contrast, the historically later Kalachakra tantra describes six chakras. In Vajrayana Buddhism, liberation is achieved through subtle body processes during Completion Stage practices such as the Six Yogas of Naropa. = Other traditions = Other spiritual traditions teach about a mystical or divine body, such as \\"the most sacred body\\" (wujud al-aqdas) and \\"true and genuine body\\" (jism asli haqiqi) in Sufism, the meridian system in Chinese religion, and \\"the immortal body\\" (soma athanaton) in Hermeticism.White.  Western esotericism  The Subtle body and the cosmic man, Nepal 1600s = Theosophy = In the 19th century, H. P. Blavatsky founded the esoteric religious system of Theosophy, which attempted to restate Hindu and Buddhist philosophy for the Western world. She adopted the phrase \\"subtle body\\" as the English equivalent of the Vedantic s≈´k·π£ma≈õarƒ´ra, which in Adi Shankara's writings was one of three bodies (physical, subtle, and causal). Geoffrey Samuel notes that theosophical use of these terms by Blavatsky and later authors, especially C. W. Leadbeater, Annie Besant and Rudolf Steiner (who went on to found Anthroposophy), has made them \\"problematic\\" to modern scholars, since the Theosophists adapted the terms as they expanded their ideas based on \\"psychic and clairvoyant insights\\", changing their meaning from what they had in their original context in India. = Post-theosophists = The later theosophical arrangement was taken up by Alice Bailey, and from there found its way into the New Age worldview and the human aura. Max Heindel divided the subtle body into the Vital Body made of Ether; the Desire body, related to the Astral plane; and the Mental body. Samael Aun Weor wrote extensively on the subtle bodies (Astral, Mental, and Causal), aligning them with the kabbalistic tree of life. Barbara Brennan's account of the subtle bodies in her books Hands of Light and Light Emerging refers to the subtle bodies as \\"layers\\" in the \\"Human Energy Field\\" or aura. = Fourth Way = Subtle bodies are found in the \\"Fourth Way\\" teachings of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky, which claim that one can create a subtle body, and hence achieve post-mortem immortality, through spiritual or yogic exercises. The \\"soul\\" in these systems is not something one is born with, but developed through esoteric practice to acquire complete understanding and to perfect the self. According to the historian Bernice Rosenthal, \\"In Gurdjieff's cosmology our nature is tripartite and is composed of the physical (planetary), emotional (astral) and mental (spiritual) bodies; in each person one of these three bodies ultimately achieves dominance.\\" The ultimate task of the fourth way teachings is to harmoniously develop the four bodies into a single way. = Aleister Crowley = The occultist Aleister Crowley's system of magick envisaged \\"a subtle body (instrument is a better term) called the Body of Light; this one develops and controls; it gains new powers as one progresses\\".Aleister Crowley Magick (Book 4), chapter 81.

History AC came back to the market after the Second World War with the 2-Litre range of cars in 1947, but it was with the Ace sports car of 1953 that the company really made its reputation in the post war years. Casting around for a replacement for the ageing 2-Litre, AC took up a design by John Tojeiro that used a light, ladder-type tubular frame, all independent transverse leaf spring suspension, and an open two-seater alloy body made using English wheeling machines, possibly inspired by the Ferrari Barchetta of the day. Early cars used AC's elderly two-litre overhead cam straight-six engine (first seen soon after the end of the First World War), which, according to a 1954 road test by Motor magazine, gave a top speed of and in 11.4 seconds and a fuel consumption of . It was hardly a sporting engine however, and it was felt that something more modern and powerful was required to put the modern chassis to good use. Joining the Ace in 1954 was the Aceca hard top coup√©, which had an early form of hatchback rear door but used the same basic timber framed alloy body. From 1956, there was the option of Bristol Cars' two-litre straight-six with 3 downdraught carburettors and slick four-speed gearbox. Top speed leapt to with in the nine second bracket. Overdrive was available from 1956 and front disc brakes were an option from 1957, although they were later standardised. 1962 2.6-litre Ruddspeed-engined Ace In 1961 a new 2.6-litre () straight-six 'Ruddspeed' option was available, adapted by Ken Rudd from the unit used in the Ford Zephyr. It used three Weber or SU carburettors and either a 'Mays' or an iron cast head. This setup boosted the car's performance further, with some versions tuned to , providing a top speed of and in 8.1 seconds. However, it was not long before Carroll Shelby drew AC's attention to the Cobra, so only 37 of the 2.6 models were made. These Ford engined models had a smaller grille which was carried over to the Cobra. For the Ace as well as the Aceca, AC used chassis numbers beginning with AE for AC-engined cars, BE for Bristol-engined ones, and RS for those equipped with the Ford unit. An \\"X\\" following the first two letters indicated an export model. With the engine set well back in the chassis, the Ace handled well and was successful in competition. Motor Sport The car raced at Le Mans in 1957 and 1958. In the 1959 24 Hours of Le Mans, Ted Whiteaway and John Turner drove their AC Ace Bristol, registration 650BPK, to the finish, claiming top honours for the 2,000cc GT class and seventh overall behind six 3 litre cars. Few cars with this provenance have survived and are extremely valuable. They can range from $100,000 or more for an unrestored car, even one in pieces, to in excess of $400,000 for a restored AC Ace. AC Cobra When Bristol ceased building their 6-cylinder engine in 1961, AC's owner, Charles Hurlock, was approached by Carroll Shelby to use a Ford V8 in the Ace chassis, producing the AC Cobra in 1962. Production of the Ace ended the same year. The AC Cobra came in small block and later big block configurations. It was Ford's 289 that powered the winning car in the GT class at Le Mans in June 1964. At the time, the AC Cobra 427 was the fastest \\"production\\" car in the world. AC Automotive AC Automotive, based in Straubenhardt, Germany still builds the AC under the original name. Cars are sold in Germany, France and England with sales in Luxembourg, Holland, Lichtenstein, Switzerland and Belgium slated for the future. Pricing for the standard ACGT model starts at ¬£104,400 before options. Replicas As with the Cobra, some AC Ace replicas have been made, such as the Hawk Ace, but are much rarer.

It was once part of Central Mindanao (Region 12) until the province was moved under Northern Mindanao (Region 10) in 2001.Godinez-Ortega, C. (2001, September 9). Iligan City 'moves' to Northern Mindanao, Philippine Daily Inquirer. P. A13.

Iligan has a total land area of , making it one of the 10 largest cities in the Philippines in terms of land area. Among the 17 highly urbanized city, excluding Metro Manila, Iligan is the third least dense, with a population density of 421 inhabitants per square kilometer, just behind Butuan and Puerto Princesa.https://psa.gov.ph/population-and-housing/node/62690 Iligan has a population of inhabitants in the . Etymology The name Iligan is from the Higaunon (Lumad/Native of Iligan) word \\"Ilig\\" which means \\"to go downstream\\". However, some also claim that the name of Iligan was taken and inspired by the Higaunon term \\"iligan\\" or \\"ilijan,\\" which means \\"fortress of defense,\\" an appropriate term due to the frequent attacks incurred by pirates as well as other Mindanaon tribes. History = Pre-Spanish colonial area = Iligan had its beginnings in the village of Bayug, four (4) kilometers north of the present Poblacion. It was the earliest pre-Spanish settlement of native sea dwellers. In the later part of the 16th century, the inhabitants were subdued by the Visayan migrants from the island-nation called the Kedatuan of Dapitan, on Panglao island. In the accounts of Jesuit historian Francisco Combes, the Mollucan Sultan of Ternate invaded Panglao. This caused the Dapitans to flee in large numbers to a re-established Dapitan, Zamboanga del Norte. = Spanish colonial era = In Dapitan, the surviving Datu of Panglao Pagbuaya, received Legazpi's expedition in 1595. Later, Pagbuaya's son Manook was baptized Pedro Manuel Manook. Sometime afterwards in by the end of the 16th century after 1595 Manook subdued the higaunon (animist) village of Bayug and turned it into one of the earliest Christian settlements in the country.History of Iligan during Spanish times Although the settlement survived other raids from other enemies, especially Muslims of Lanao, the early settlers and converts moved their settlement from Bayug to Iligan, which the Augustinian Recollects founded in 1609,All About Iligan thus founding the oldest town in northern Mindanao. Camp Overton in 1900, an American Armybase, currently the location of Global Steel Philippines Inc. The Jesuits replaced the Recollects in 1639. Iligan was the Spaniards' base of operations in attempting to conquer and Christianize the Lake Lanao area throughout its history. A stone fort called Fort St. Francis Xavier was built in 1642 where Iliganons sought refuge during raids by bandits. But the fort sank due to floods. Another fort was built and this was named Fort Victoria or Cota de Iligan. In 1850, because of floods, Don Remigio Cabili, then Iligan's governadorcillo, built another fort and moved the poblacion of the old Iligan located at the mouth of Tubod River west of the old market to its present site. Being the oldest town in Northern Mindanao, Iligan was already a part of the once undivided Misamis Province by year 1832. However, it did not have an independent religious administration because its diocese by then was based at Misamis, the provincial capital. It was one of the biggest municipalities of Misamis Province. The Spaniards abandoned Iligan in 1899, paving the way for the landing of the American forces in 1900. =American era= Iligan, circa 1903-1913 In 1903, the Moro Province was created.

He became the Supreme Commander of the Ukrainian Army and the President of the Ukrainian People's Republic during Ukraine's short-lived sovereignty in 1918‚Äì1921, leading Ukraine's struggle for independence following the fall of the Russian Empire in 1917.  Career to 1917  Born on Hunczak, T. Petliura, Symon. Encyclopedia of Ukraine. in a suburb of Poltava (then part of the Russian Empire), Symon Petliura was the son of Vasyl Pavlovych Petliura and Olha Oleksiyivna (n√©e Marchenko), of Cossack background. His father, a Poltava city resident, had owned a transportation business; his mother was a daughter of an Orthodox hieromonk (priest-monk). Petliura obtained his initial education in parochial schools, and planned to become an Orthodox priest.The Petliura family was very pious. His two sisters became nuns and his nephew Stepan Ivanovych Skrypnyk became the Patriarch Mstyslav of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (in office 1991-1993). Petiura studied in the Russian Orthodox Seminary in Poltava from 1895 to 1901. While there he joined the Hromada society in 1898. When his membership in Hromada was discovered in 1901, he was expelled from the seminary. In 1900 Petliura joined the Revolutionary Ukrainian Party (RUP). In 1902, under threat of arrest, he moved to Yekaterinodar in the Kuban, where he worked for two years ‚Äì initially as a schoolteacher and later as an archivist for the Kuban Cossack Host helping to organize over 200,000 documents. In December 1903 he was arrested for organizing a RUP branch in Yekaterinodar and for publishing inflammatory anti-tsarist articles in the Ukrainian press outside of Imperial Russia (in Austrian-controlled Lemberg in Galicia). Released on bail in March 1904, he moved briefly to Kiev and then emigrated to the Western Ukrainian city of Lviv ‚Äì then officially called Lemberg ‚Äì in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In Lviv, Petliura lived under the name of Sviatoslav Tagon,All pseudonyms and cryptonyms of Symon Petliura . (in reference to the Library of S.Petliura and A.Zhuk) working alongside Ivan Franko and Volodymyr Hnatiuk as an editor for the journal ' (\\"Literary Scientific Herald\\"), the Shevchenko Scientific Society and as a co-editor of ' newspaper. He also contributed numerous articles to the Ukrainian-language press in Galicia. At the end of 1905, after an amnesty was declared, Petliura returned briefly to Kiev, but soon moved to the Russian capital of Petersburg in order to publish the socialist-democratic monthly magazine Vil‚Äôna Ukrayina (\\"Free Ukraine\\") along with and Mykola Porsh. After Russian censors closed this magazine in July 1905, he moved back to Kiev where he worked for the newspaper ' (\\"The Council\\"). In 1907‚Äì09 he became the editor of the literary magazine Slovo (, \\"The Word\\") and co-editor of Ukrayina (, \\"Ukraine\\"). Because of the closure of these publications by the Russian Imperial authorities, Petliura had once again to move from Kiev. He went to Moscow in 1909, where he worked briefly as an accountant. There in 1910 he married Olha Bilska (1885‚Äì1959), with whom he had a daughter, Lesia (1911‚Äì1942). From 1912 until May 1917 he served as a co- editor of the influential Russian-language journal ' (Ukrainian Life). Journalism and publications As the editor of numerous journals and newspapers, Petliura published over 15,000 critical articles, reviews, stories and poems under an estimated 120 nom-de-plumes. His prolific work in both the Russian and Ukrainian languages helped shape the mindset of the Ukrainian population in the years leading up to the Revolution in both Eastern and Western Ukraine. His prolific correspondence was of great benefit when the Revolution broke out in 1917, as he had contacts throughout Ukraine. =Publications before 1914= As the Ukrainian language had been outlawed in the Russian Empire by the Ems Ukaz of 1876, Petliura found more freedom to publish Ukraine oriented articles in Saint Petersburg than in Ukraine. There, he published the magazine Vilna Ukrayina (, \\"Independent Ukraine\\") until July 1905. Tsarist censors, however, closed this magazine, and Petliura moved back to Kiev. In Kiev, Petliura first worked for Rada. In 1907 he became editor of the literary magazine Slovo. Also, he co-edited the magazine Ukrayina. In 1909, these publications were closed by Russian imperial police, and Petliura moved back to Moscow to publish. There, he was co-editor of the Russian language journal Ukrayinskaya Zhizn to familiarize the local population with news and culture of what was known as Malorossia. He was chief editor with this publication from 1912 to 1914. In Moscow he married his wife Olha Bilska in 1915 (later she was also known as her husband under the surname of Marchenko). There, in Moscow was born the daughter of Petliura, Lesia (Olesia). =Publications after emigration= In Paris, Petliura continued the struggle for Ukrainian independence as a publicist. In 1924, Petliura became the editor and publisher of the weekly journal (\\"Trident\\"). He contributed to this journal using various pen names, including V. Marchenko, and V. Salevsky. Revolution in Ukraine =Rise to power= In May 1917 Petliura attended the First All-Ukrainian Congress of Soldier Deputies held in Kiev as a delegate. On May 18 he was elected head of the Ukrainian General Military Committee, the ultimate progenitor of the modern Ukrainian Ministry of Defense. With the proclamation of the Central Council of Ukraine on June 28, 1917, Petliura became the first Secretary (Minister) for Military Affairs. Disagreeing with the politics of the then chairman of the General Secretariat Volodymyr Vynnychenko, Petliura left the government and became the head of the Haidamaka Kish, a military formation of Sloboda Ukraine (in Kharkiv). In January‚ÄìFebruary 1918 the Haidamaka Kish was forced back to protect Kiev during the Uprising at the Kiev Arsenal Plant and to prevent the capture of the capital by the Bolshevik Red Guard. After the Hetmanate Putsch (April 28, 1918), the Skoropadsky administration arrested Petliura and incarcerated him for four months in Bila Tserkva. After his release, Petliura participated in the anti-Hetmanate putsch of November 1918 and became a member of the Directorate of Ukraine as the Chief of Military Forces. Following the fall of Kiev (February 1919) and the emigration of Vynnychenko from Ukraine, Petliura became the leader of the Directorate on 11 February 1919. In his capacity as head of the Army and State, he continued to fight both Bolshevik and White forces in Ukraine for the next ten months. =1919= With the outbreak of hostilities between Ukraine and Soviet Russia in January 1919, and with Vynnychenko's emigration, Petliura ultimately became the leading figure in the Directorate. During the winter of 1919 the Petliura army lost most of Ukraine (including Kiev) to Bolsheviks and by March 6 relocated to Podolia. In the spring of 1919 he managed to extinguish a coup-d'etat led by Volodymyr Oskilko who saw Petliura cooperating with socialists such as Borys Martos. During the course of the year, Petliura continued to defend the fledgling republic against incursions by the Bolsheviks, Anton Denikin's White Russians, and the Romanian-Polish troops. By autumn of 1919, most of Denikin's White Russian forces were defeated ‚Äî in the meantime, however, the Bolsheviks had grown to become the dominant force in Ukraine. Polish General Antoni Listowski and Symon Petliura in Berdychiv during the Kiev Offensive J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski and Symon Petliura Kiev, May 1920 =1920= Petliura withdrew to Poland December 5, 1919, which had previously recognized him as the head of the legal government of Ukraine. In April 1920, as head of the Ukrainian People's Republic, he signed an alliance in Warsaw with the Polish government, agreeing to a border on the River Zbruch and recognizing Poland's right to Galicia in exchange for military aid in overthrowing the Bolshevik regime. Polish forces, reinforced by Petliura's remaining troops (some two divisions), attacked Kiev on May 7, 1920 in what became a turning point of the 1919‚Äì21 Polish-Bolshevik war. Following initial successes, Pi≈Çsudski's and Petliura's forces were pushed back to the Vistula River and the Polish capital, Warsaw. The Polish Army defeated the Bolshevik Russians in the end, but the Red Army was never cleared from all of Ukraine and therefore Ukrainians were unable to secure independence. Petliura directed the affairs of the Ukrainian government-in- exile from Tarn√≥w and when the Soviet Union requested Petliura's extradition from Poland, the Poles engineered his \\"disappearance\\", secretly moving him from Tarn√≥w to Warsaw. =After the revolution= Bolshevik Russia persistently demanded that Petliura be handed over. Protected by several Polish friends and colleagues, such as Henryk J√≥zewski, with the establishment of the Soviet Union on December 30, 1922, Petliura, in late 1923 left Poland for Budapest, then Vienna, Geneva and finally settled in Paris in early 1924. Here he established and edited the Ukrainian language newspaper Tryzub. Promoting a Ukrainian cultural identity During his time as leader of the Directorate, Petliura was active in supporting Ukrainian culture both in Ukraine and abroad. =Supporting culture in Ukraine= Petliura introduced the awarding of the title \\"People's Artist of Ukraine\\" to artists who had made significant contributions to Ukrainian culture. A similar title award was continued after a significant break under the Soviet regime. Among those who had received this award was blind kobza player Ivan Kuchuhura-Kucherenko. =Promoting Ukrainian culture abroad= He also saw the value in gaining international support and recognition of Ukrainian arts through cultural exchanges. Most notably, Petliura actively supported the work of cultural leaders such as the choreographer Vasyl Avramenko, conductor Oleksander Koshetz and bandurist Vasyl Yemetz, to allow them to travel internationally and promote an awareness of Ukrainian culture. Koshetz created the Ukrainian Republic Capella and took it on tour internationally, giving concerts in Europe and the Americas. One of the concerts by the Capella inspired George Gershwin to write \\"Summertime\\", based on the lullaby \\"Oi Khodyt Son Kolo Vikon\\"Klymkiw, Walter. \\"Olexander Koshetz Ukraine's Great Choral Conductor.\\" Forum 67, 1986: 15. All three musicians later emigrated to the United States. Life in exile (Paris) In Paris, Petliura directed the activities of the government of the Ukrainian National Republic in exile. He launched the weekly Tryzub, and continued to edit and write numerous articles under various pen names with an emphasis on questions dealing with national oppression in Ukraine. These articles were written with a literary flair. The question of national awareness was often of significance in his literary work. Petliura's articles had a significant impact on the shaping of Ukrainian national awareness in the early 20th century. He published articles and brochures under a variety of noms de plume, including V. Marchenko, V. Salevsky, I. Rokytsky, and O.

A total of 1,236 violent attacks on Jews had been recorded between 1918 and 1921 in Ukraine. Among them, 493 were carried out by Ukrainian People's Republic soldiers under the command of Symon Petliura, 307 by independent Ukrainian warlords, 213 by Denikin's army, 106 by the Red Army, and 32 by the Polish Army,Richard Pipes.

The newly formed Ukrainian state (Ukrainian People's Republic) promised Jews full equality and autonomy. Arnold Margolin, a Jewish assistant minister in Petliura's UPR government, declared in May 1919 that the Ukrainian government had given Jews more rights than they enjoyed in any other European government.Hostages of modernization: studies on modern antisemitism,1870-1933/39 volume 2, edited by Herbert Strauss.

Berlin: Walter de Gruyter and Company pp: 1307‚Äì1309 However, after 1918, Petliura gradually lost control over most of his military units, with some of the breakaway units getting involved in pogroms against Jews. During Petliura's term as Head of State (1919‚Äì20), pogroms continued to be perpetrated on Ukrainian territory.Orest Subtelny, Ukraine: A History (4th ed.), pp. 363‚Äì364, University of Toronto Press, 2009, Petliura's role in the pogroms has been a topic of dispute since his assassination in 1926 and the succeeding Schwartzbard's trial. In 1969, the journal of Jewish Social Studies published two opposing views regarding Petliura's responsibility in pogroms against Jews during his reign over Ukraine, by scholars Taras HunczakHunczak, T.

Assassination President Victor Yushchenko and his wife laying flowers at Symon Petliura's grave in Paris, 2005 On May 25, 1926, at 14:12, by the Gibert bookstore, Petliura was walking on Rue Racine near Boulevard Saint-Michel of the Latin Quarter in Paris and was approached by Sholom Schwartzbard. Schwartzbard asked him in Ukrainian, \\"Are you Mr. Petliura?\\" Petliura did not answer but raised his walking cane. Then, as Schwartzbard claimed in court, he pulled out a gun and shot him five times.Petlura Trial. TIME magazine of November 7, 1927 Schwartzbard was an anarchist of Jewish descent, born in Ukraine. He participated in the Jewish self-defense of Balta in 1905. The Russian Tsarist government sentenced him to 3 months in prison for \\"provoking\\" the Balta pogrom.Saul Friedman: Pogromchik ‚Äì NY, 1976, p.58 He was twice convicted of taking part in anarchist \\"expropriation\\" (burglary) and bank robbery in Austria-Hungary. He later joined the French Foreign Legion (1914‚Äì1917) and was wounded in the Battle of the Somme. It is reported that Schwartzbard told famous fellow anarchist leader Nestor Makhno in Paris that he was terminally ill and expected to die and that he would take Petliura with him; Makhno forbade Schwartzbard to do so.http://www.gpu.ua/index.php?&id;=113694&eid;=131 (in Ukrainian) According to a defected KGB operative Peter Deriabin, Schwartzbard was a Soviet (NKVD) agent and acted on the order from a former chairman of the Soviet Ukrainian government and current Soviet Ambassador to France, Christian Rakovsky. The special operation of the GPU was consolidated by GPU agent Mikhail Volodin, who arrived in France August 8, 1925 and who had been in close contact with Schwartzbard.UNP requests Chernomyrdin to hand over archive documents about the assassination of Petliura, Newsru.ua, May 22, 2009\\"Convenient\\" assassination, \\"Tyzhden.ua\\", June 15, 2011 Schwartzbard's parents were among fifteen members of his family murdered in the pogroms in Odessa. The core defense at the Schwartzbard trial was ‚Äî as presented by the noted jurist Henri Torres ‚Äî that he was avenging the deaths of more than 50,000 Jewish victims of the pogroms, whereas the prosecution (both criminal and civil) tried to show that Petliura was not responsible for the pogroms and that Schwartzbard was a Soviet agent. After a trial lasting eight days the jury acquitted Schwartzbard.Saul S. Friedman, Pogromchik: The Assassination of Simon Petlura. New York : Hart Pub, 1976. Petliura was buried alongside his wife and daughter in the Cimeti√®re du Montparnasse in Paris, France. Petliura's two sisters, Orthodox nuns who had remained in Poltava, were arrested and shot in 1928 by the NKVD (the Soviet secret police). It is claimed that in March 1926, Vlas Chubar (Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Ukraine), in a speech given in Kharkiv and repeated in Moscow, warned of the danger Petliura represented to Soviet power. It was after this speech that the command had allegedly been given to assassinate Petliura.Ukrainian:Shelest, V. Symon Petliura ‚Äì Liudyna i derzhavnyk Toronto, 1997, p.47 Legacy =Ukraine= A bust of Petliura in Rivne With the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, previously restricted Soviet archives have allowed numerous politicians and historians to review Petliura's role in Ukrainian history. Some consider him a national hero who strove for the independence of Ukraine. Several cities, including Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital and Poltava, the city of his birth, have erected monuments to Petliura, with a museum complex also being planned in Poltava. Petliura's statue, unveiled in Vinnytsia in October 2017, was denounced as disgraceful and deplorable by the World Jewish Congress.Ukraine Unveils Statue Honoring Nationalist Leader Behind Regime That Killed Up to 50,000 Jews, Haaretz (17 October 2017) To mark the 80th anniversary of his assassination, a twelve-volume edition of his writings, including articles, letters and historic documents, has been published in Kyiv by the Taras Shevchenko University and the State Archive of Ukraine. In 1992 in Poltava, a series of readings known as \\"Petlurivski chytannia\\" have become an annual event, and since 1993, they take place annually at Kyiv University. In June 2009, the Kyiv City Council renamed Komintern's Street (located in the Shevchenkivskyi District) into to commemorate the occasion of his 130th birthday anniversary.Kyiv Council Renames Kominterna Street Into Petliura Street, Ukrainian News Agency (June 18, 2009) In current Ukraine Petliura has not been as lionized as Mykhailo Hrushevsky (who played a much smaller role in the Ukrainian People's Republic) since Petliura was too closely associated with violence to make a good symbolic figure.Serhy Yekelchyk, Ukraine: Birth of a Modern Nation, Oxford University Press (2007), In a 2008 poll of \\"Famous Ukrainians of all times\\" (in which respondents did not receive any lists or tips) Petliura was not mentioned (Hrushevsky came in sixth place in this poll).Famous Ukrainians of all times , Sociological group \\"RATING\\" (2012/05/28) In the 2008 TV project Velyki Ukra√Øntsi (\\"Greatest Ukrainians\\") he placed 26th.Top 11‚Äì100, Velyki Ukra√Øntsi. A nephew of Symon Petliura, Stepan Skrypnyk became the Patriarch Mstyslav of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church on 6 June 1990. =Ukrainian diaspora= For part of the Western Ukrainian diaspora, Petliura is remembered as a national hero, a fighter for Ukrainian independence, a martyr, who inspired hundreds of thousands to fight for an independent Ukrainian state. He has inspired original music,Melnyk, Lubomyr and youth organizations.Ukrainian Youth Association (CYM) ‚Äì US =Petliura in Ukrainian folk songs= During the revolution Petliura became the subject of numerous folk songs, primarily as a hero calling for his people to unite against foreign oppression. His name became synonymous with the call for freedom.Danylevsky, Rev. Prof. K. Petliura v sertsiakh i pisniakh svoho narodu ‚Äì Regensberg 1947 p. 3 15 songs were recorded by the ethnographer rev. prof. K. Danylevsky. In the songs Petliura is depicted as a soldier, in a manner similar to Robin Hood, mocking Skoropadsky and the Bolshevik Red Guard. News of Petliura‚Äôs assassination in the summer of 1926 was marked by numerous revolts in eastern Ukraine particularly in Boromlia, Zhehailivtsi, (Sumy province), Velyka Rublivka, Myloradov (Poltava province), Hnylsk, Bilsk, Kuzemyn and all along the Vorskla River from Okhtyrka to Poltava, Burynia, Nizhyn (Chernihiv province) and other cities.Danylevsky, Rev. Prof. K. Petliura v sertsiakh i pisniakh svoho narodu ‚Äì Regensberg 1947 p. 6 These revolts were brutally pacified by the Soviet administration. The blind kobzars Pavlo Hashchenko and Ivan Kuchuhura Kucherenko composed a duma (epic poem) in memory of Symon Petliura. To date Petliura is the only modern Ukrainian politician to have a duma created and sung in his memory. This duma became popular among the kobzars of left-bank Ukraine and was sung also by Stepan Pasiuha, Petro Drevchenko, Bohushchenko, and Chumak.Danylevsky, Rev. Prof. K. Petliura v sertsiakh i pisniakh svoho narodu ‚Äì Regensberg 1947 p. 8 The Soviets also tried their hand at portraying Petliura through the arts in order to discredit the Ukrainian national leader. A number of humorous songs appeared in which Petliura is portrayed as a traveling beggar whose only territory is that which is under his train carriage. A number of plays such as The Republic on Wheels by Yakov Mamontov and the opera Shchors by Boris Liatoshinsky and Arsenal by Georgy Maiboroda portray Petliura in a negative light, as a lackey who sold out Western Ukraine to Poland, often using the very same melodies which had become popular during the fight for Ukrainian Independence in 1918. Petliura continues to be portrayed by the Ukrainian people in its folk songs in a manner similar to Taras Shevchenko and Bohdan Khmelnytsky. He is likened to the sun which suddenly stopped shining.

It runs almost the length of Notting Hill from south to north, roughly parallel with Ladbroke Grove. On Saturdays it is home to Portobello Road Market, one of London's notable street markets, known for its second-hand clothes and antiques. Every August since 1996, the Portobello Film Festival has been held in locations around Portobello Road and in 2015, Portobello Radio was founded as the area's community radio station. History =Origins= Portobello Road was known prior to 1740 as Green's Lane ‚Äì a winding country path leading from Kensington Gravel Pits, in what is now Notting Hill Gate, up to Kensal Green in the north. =18th century= In 1740, Portobello Farm was built in the area near what is now Golborne Road. The farm got its name from a popular victory during the lost War of Jenkins' Ear, when Admiral Edward Vernon captured the Spanish-ruled town of Puerto Bello (now known as Portobelo in modern-day Panama). Vernon Yard, which runs off Portobello Road, still honours the Admiral's name to this day. The Portobello farming area covered the land which is now St Charles' Hospital. =19th century= 1841 map of the Environs of London, showing the Portobello Farm on the upper left-hand side, and Porto Bello Lane. Portobello Farm was sold to an order of nuns after the railways came in 1864. They built St Joseph's Convent for the Dominican Order - or the \\"Black Friars\\" as they were known in England. Portobello Road is a construction of the Victorian era. Before about 1850, it was little more than a country lane connecting Portobello Farm with Kensal Green in the north and what is today Notting Hill in the south. Much of it consisted of hayfields, orchards and other open land. The road ultimately took form piecemeal in the second half of the 19th century, nestling between the large new residential developments of Paddington and Notting Hill. Its shops and markets thrived on serving the wealthy inhabitants of the elegant crescents and terraces that sprang up around it, and its working-class residents found employment in the immediate vicinity as construction workers, domestic servants, coachmen, messengers, tradesmen and costermongers. After the Hammersmith and City Railway line was completed in 1864, and Ladbroke Grove station opened, the northern end of Portobello Road was also developed, and the last of the open fields disappeared under brick and concrete. Today A range of communities inhabit Portobello. Its architecture is characterised by meandering roads and curving streets, in contrast to the more formally planned layout of most of the nearby area. Mid- to late-Victorian terrace houses and shops predominate, squeezed tightly into the available space. The Friends of Portobello campaign seeks to preserve the street's unique dynamic, and campaigns against branded chain stores. Portobello Road is also home to the Grade II* Electric Cinema, one of Britain's oldest cinemas. Geography The road descends from 84 feet (25.6 m) above sea level at the northern end, the highest point, to a lowest point of 65 feet (19.8 m), just south of the overpasses, after which the road rises and falls before reaching a high point of 78 feet (23.8 m) at the southern end. The average grade of ascent or descent between the northern end and the lowest point is about 1.77 percent. Portobello Road Market Portobello Road Market, June 2005. An antique dealer on Portobello Road Stand selling T-shirts along the crowded market Portobello Road Market draws thousands of tourists each year. The main market day for antiques is Saturday, the only day when all five sections are opened: second-hand goods, clothing and fashion, household essentials, fruit, vegetables and other food, and antiques. However, there are also clothing, antique, bric-a-brac, fruit and vegetable stalls throughout the week and are located further north than the antiques, near the Westway Flyover. Shops and cafes are opened daily. The market began as many other London markets and mainly sold fresh-food in the 19th century; antiques and wares dealers arrived in the late 1940s and '50s, and gradually antiques have become the main attraction of this market, having a substantial number of them trading mainly on Saturday mornings. It is the largest antiques market in the UK. The market section of Portobello Road runs in a direction generally between the north-northwest and the south-south-east. The northern terminus is at Golborne Road; the southern end is at Westbourne Grove, to the east. The market area is about 1,028 yards (940 m) long. About one third of the way from its north end, the market runs beneath adjacent bridges of the A40 road and the Hammersmith & City line of the London Underground. Here the market focuses on second hand clothes as well as couture. Market in the media George Orwell's 1927 lodgings in Portobello Road = Films = The market was the setting for the 1999 film Notting Hill, with much of the filming taking place on the street. The famed blue door, however, no longer exists, having been sold. The 1950 Ealing Studios police thriller, The Blue Lamp, starring Dirk Bogarde and Jack Warner, as P.C. George Dixon, a character later revived in the long-running TV drama, Dixon of Dock Green, featured location filming in the Paddington/Notting Hill/Portobello area. It features good shots of these locations in pre-Westway days, and includes a thrilling car chase along largely traffic-free roads, including Portobello Road. The market was featured in the 1971 musical film, Bedknobs and Broomsticks in a scene involving a song (\\"Portobello Road\\") and dance in and around the market staged on sets built at Disney's Burbank Studios. The lyrics refer to the market and the people who live and work there. In 2006, the 20-minute documentary Portobello: Attack of the Clones won London awards and was screened a number of times at the infamous Electric Cinema. The film showed how Portobello Road is threatened by high-street stores changing the street's independent spirit. It featured a large number of local stallholders and influencers, and was made by local filmmakers Paul McCrudden and Alex Thomas for TAG Films. = Theatre = The 1959 British musical Make Me an Offer, with book by Wolf Mankowitz based on his novel of the same title, and music and lyrics by David Heneker and Monty Norman, takes place on Portobello Road, and includes the song \\"Portobello Road\\", sung by the ensemble. Another song, \\"I Want a Lock-up\\", also refers to Portobello Road. The musical is available for licensing through Samuel French, Inc. = Literature = The Portobello Road features prominently in Martin Amis's 1989 satirical novel London Fields. In the short story \\"The Portobello Road\\", Muriel Spark narrates the story of a murderer who, visited by the ghost of his victim, Macbeth-style, tends to constantly go to the Portobello Road market to meet her. \\"The Portobello Road\\" was included in the 1958 collection The Go-away Bird and Other Stories. The cult British children's book character Paddington Bear, featured in the books written by Michael Bond, enjoys visiting Portobello Market on a daily basis. His friend Mr. Gruber, with whom Paddington has his elevenses every day, owns an antique shop on the Portobello Road. In 2008, Ruth Rendell published a novel set in the area entitled, Portobello. It is the setting for Paulo Coelho's 2007 novel, The Witch of Portobello. In the 1970 novel The Chinese Agent by author Michael Moorcock, a world-renowned jewel-thief more than meets his match when he attempts to swipe a brooch from a Portobello Road market stall, and is hunted down through the streets like a dog by the sharp-eyed market traders. Portobello Road is also mentioned in Indian Urdu writer Shamsur Rehman Faruqui's 2006 novel The Mirror of Beauty. = Music = In 1978, the rock band Dire Straits sang about the road in the song \\"Portobello Belle\\" on their second album Communiqu√©. In the narrative introduction to their song Have Some Madeira M'Dear, Michael Flanders of Flanders & Swann mentions a decanter he owns ‚Äì \\"cut glass, from the Portobello Road\\" ‚Äì in which he keeps Madeira. That decanter plus his Edwardian hat, are credited as the inspirations for the song (album: At the Drop of a Hat). Donovan's song \\"Sunny South Kensington\\" containing the lyrics: \\"...in the Portobella I met a fella with a cane umbrella.\\" The B-side of British Singer-Songwriter Cat Stevens' 1966 single \\"I Love My Dog\\" is titled \\"Portobello Road\\" and discusses a walk through the famous street and market. The track also appears on Cat Stevens' 1967 debut album Matthew and Son. It is also referenced in the song \\"Blue Jeans\\" by alternative rock band Blur, from the 1993 album Modern Life Is Rubbish, in which the opening lyrics are: \\"Air cushioned soles, I bought them on the Portobello Road on a Saturday.\\" In Caetano Veloso's \\"Nine Out Of Ten\\" song from the 1972 album Transa, he sings \\"walk down Portobello Road to the sound of reggae\\". The Brazilian artist lived in London in the late 1960s and early 1970s because of his exile from Brazil. = TV = In the Only Fools and Horses episode \\"Cash and Curry\\", conmen who con Del Boy and Rodney Trotter using a statue of Kubera bought it from Portobello Road. The idea for the episode is as the writer, John Sullivan, visited the street and it gave him an idea for a new episode. The street and its name also appeared regularly on the hit TV series Minder. BBC One's daytime antiques-based gameshow Bargain Hunt regularly features contestants buying items at the market to sell later at auction. The 1977 to 1983 Italian television broadcast RAI was named Portobello after Portobello Road.

The somatic nervous system consists of afferent nerves or sensory nerves, and efferent nerves or motor nerves. Afferent nerves are responsible for relaying sensation from the body to the central nervous system; efferent nerves are responsible for sending out commands from the CNS to the body, stimulating muscle contraction; they include all the non-sensory neurons connected with skeletal muscles and skin. The a- of afferent and the e- of efferent correspond to the prefixes ad- (to, toward) and ex- (out of). Structure There are 43 segments of nerves in the human body. With each segment, there is a pair of sensory and motor nerves. In the body, 31 segments of nerves are in the spinal cord and 12 are in the brain stem. Besides these, thousands of association nerves are also present in the body. Thus the somatic nervous system consists of two parts: * Spinal nerves: They are peripheral nerves that carry sensory information into and motor commands out of the spinal cord. * Cranial nerves: They are the nerve fibers that carry information into and out of the brain stem. They include smell, vision, eye, eye muscles, mouth, taste, ear, neck, shoulders, and tongue. Function The somatic nervous system controls all voluntary muscular systems within the body, and the process of voluntary reflex arcs. The basic route of nerve signals within the efferent somatic nervous system involves a sequence that begins in the upper cell bodies of motor neurons (upper motor neurons) within the precentral gyrus (which approximates the primary motor cortex). Stimuli from the precentral gyrus are transmitted from upper motor neurons and down the corticospinal tract, via axons to control skeletal (voluntary) muscles. These stimuli are conveyed from upper motor neurons through the ventral horn of the spinal cord, and across synapses to be received by the sensory receptors of alpha motor neurons (large lower motor neurons) of the brainstem and spinal cord. Upper motor neurons release a neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, from their axon terminal knobs, which are received by nicotinic receptors of the alpha motor neurons. In turn, alpha motor neurons relay the stimulus. From there, acetylcholine is released from the axon terminal knobs of alpha motor neurons and received by postsynaptic receptors (Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors) of muscles, thereby relaying the stimulus to contract muscle fibers. =Reflex arcs= A reflex arc is a neural circuit that creates a more or less automatic link between a sensory input and a specific motor output. Reflex circuits vary in complexity‚Äîthe simplest spinal reflexes are mediated by a two-element chain, of which in the human body there is only one, also called a monosynaptic reflex (there is only one synapse between the two neurones taking part in the arc: sensory and motor). The singular example of a monosynaptic reflex is the patellar reflex. The next simplest reflex arc is a three-element chain, beginning with sensory neurons, which activate interneurons inside of the spinal cord, which then activate motor neurons. Some reflex responses, such as withdrawing the hand after touching a hot surface, are protective, but others, such as the patellar reflex (\\"knee jerk\\") activated by tapping the patellar tendon, contribute to ordinary behavior. Other animals In invertebrates, depending on the neurotransmitter released and the type of receptor it binds, the response in the muscle fiber could either be excitatory or inhibitory. For vertebrates, however, the response of a skeletal striated muscle fiber to a neurotransmitter ‚Äì always acetylcholine (ACh) ‚Äì can only be excitatory.

He is best known as creator, executive producer, writer and director of the TV comedy series Trailer Park Boys (2001‚Äì2008), for his work with This Hour Has 22 Minutes (2004), and as the co-creator of the Adult Swim series Black Jesus (2014‚Äìpresent). Early life A native of Cole Harbour, a suburb of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Clattenburg spent his years after high school as drummer in a Police-inspired rock band, The Spawning Grunions. Career Clattenburg's jump from music to television began with his co- hosting and production of a Halifax Cable 10 show, That Damn Cable Show, from 1990 to 1993. The program featured on-location interviews and profiles of Halifax entertainers, many of whom were acquaintances of Clattenburg's through his band contacts. Wedged in between the entertainer segments were comedic three-minute clips that displayed his early talent for irreverent film making. That Damn Cable Show was remarkable for its high production values despite being a local cable channel production on a shoestring budget, and made an early name for Clattenburg in film production circles. Outgrowing the local cable television station, Clattenburg made the move to professional television production with work on comedy and drama programs at the CBC Television, including Pit Pony, Street Cents, The Bette Show, and a variety of segments for Sesame Street. His credits include the direction of music videos for Gord Downie, Len, The Tragically Hip, comedy rap group Three Loco, and, most recently, a rap video for Far East Movement featuring Riff Raff of Three Loco. In addition to Trailer Park Boys and its associated films Trailer Park Boys: The Movie, Trailer Park Boys: Countdown to Liquor Day and Trailer Park Boys 3: Don't Legalize It, Clattenburg also directed the films Afghan Luke and Moving Day, which were released in Toronto and Halifax on July 20, 2012, and the short film Crackin' Down Hard. He is co-creator, executive producer, co-writer (along with Aaron McGruder), and director of the Adult Swim series Black Jesus, which premiered on August 7, 2014. He is co-creator (along with Mike O'Neill from Trailer Park Boys), director and an executive producer of Canadian television comedy series Crawford, which premiered as a streaming video on February 2, 2018.

By the variable transformation then it is defined by : \\\\mathit{Z} (V,u) = \\\\exp \\\\left( \\\\sum_{m=1}^{\\\\infty} N_m \\\\frac{u^m}{m} \\\\right) as the formal power series of the variable u. Equivalently, the local zeta function sometimes is defined as follows: : (1)\\\\ \\\\ \\\\mathit{Z} (V,0) = 1 \\\\, : (2)\\\\ \\\\ \\\\frac{d}{du} \\\\log \\\\mathit{Z} (V,u) = \\\\sum_{m=1}^{\\\\infty} N_m u^{m-1}\\\\ . In other word, the local zeta function with coefficients in the finite field is defined as a function whose logarithmic derivative generates the numbers of the solutions of equation, defining , in the degree extension Formulation Given a finite field F, there is, up to isomorphism, just one field Fk with :[ F_k : F ] = k \\\\,, for k = 1, 2, ... . Given a set of polynomial equations -- or an algebraic variety V -- defined over F, we can count the number :N_k \\\\, of solutions in Fk and create the generating function :G(t) = N_1t +N_2t^2/2 + N_3t^3/3 +\\\\cdots \\\\,. The correct definition for Z(t) is to make log Z equal to G, and so :Z= \\\\exp (G(t)) \\\\, we will have Z(0) = 1 since G(0) = 0, and Z(t) is a priori a formal power series. Note that the logarithmic derivative :Z'(t)/Z(t) \\\\, equals the generating function :G'(t) = N_1 +N_2t^1 + N_3t^2 +\\\\cdots \\\\,. Examples For example, assume all the Nk are 1; this happens for example if we start with an equation like X = 0, so that geometrically we are taking V a point. Then :G(t) = -\\\\log(1 - t) is the expansion of a logarithm (for t < 1). In this case we have :Z(t) = \\\\frac{1}{(1 - t)}\\\\ . To take something more interesting, let V be the projective line over F. If F has q elements, then this has q + 1 points, including as we must the one point at infinity. Therefore, we shall have :N_k = q^k + 1 and :G(t) = -\\\\log(1 - t) -\\\\log(1 - qt) for t small enough. In this case we have :Z(t) = \\\\frac{1}{(1 - t)(1 - qt)}\\\\ . The first study of these functions was in the 1923 dissertation of Emil Artin. He obtained results for the case of hyperelliptic curve, and conjectured the further main points of the theory as applied to curves. The theory was then developed by F. K. Schmidt and Helmut Hasse.Daniel Bump, Algebraic Geometry (1998), p. 195. The earliest known non-trivial cases of local zeta-functions were implicit in Carl Friedrich Gauss's Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, article 358; there certain particular examples of elliptic curves over finite fields having complex multiplication have their points counted by means of cyclotomy.Barry Mazur, Eigenvalues of Frobenius, p. 244 in Algebraic Geometry, Arcata 1974: Proceedings American Mathematical Society (1974). For the definition and some examples, see also.Robin Hartshorne, Algebraic Geometry, p. 449 Springer 1977 APPENDIX C \\"The Weil Conjectures\\" Motivations The relationship between the definitions of G and Z can be explained in a number of ways. (See for example the infinite product formula for Z below.) In practice it makes Z a rational function of t, something that is interesting even in the case of V an elliptic curve over finite field. It is the functions Z that are designed to multiply, to get global zeta functions. Those involve different finite fields (for example the whole family of fields Z/pZ as p runs over all prime numbers). In that connection, the variable t undergoes substitution by p‚àís, where s is the complex variable traditionally used in Dirichlet series. (For details see Hasse-Weil zeta-function.) With that understanding, the products of the Z in the two cases used as examples come out as \\\\zeta(s) and \\\\zeta(s)\\\\zeta(s-1). Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields For projective curves C over F that are non-singular, it can be shown that :Z(t) = \\\\frac{P(t)}{(1 - t)(1 - qt)}\\\\ , with P(t) a polynomial, of degree 2g where g is the genus of C. Rewriting :P(t)=\\\\prod^{2g}_{i=1}(1-\\\\omega_i t)\\\\ , the Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields states :\\\\omega_i=q^{1/2}\\\\ . For example, for the elliptic curve case there are two roots, and it is easy to show the absolute values of the roots are q1/2. Hasse's theorem is that they have the same absolute value; and this has immediate consequences for the number of points. Andr√© Weil proved this for the general case, around 1940 (Comptes Rendus note, April 1940): he spent much time in the years after that writing up the algebraic geometry involved. This led him to the general Weil conjectures, Alexander Grothendieck developed the scheme theory for the sake of resolving it and finally, Pierre Deligne had proved a generation later. See √©tale cohomology for the basic formulae of the general theory. General formulas for the zeta function It is a consequence of the Lefschetz trace formula for the Frobenius morphism that :Z(X,t)=\\\\prod_{i=0}^{2\\\\dim X}\\\\det\\\\big(1-t \\\\mbox{Frob}_q H^i_c(\\\\overline{X},{\\\\mathbb Q}_\\\\ell)\\\\big)^{(-1)^{i+1}}. Here X is a separated scheme of finite type over the finite field F with q elements, and Frobq is the geometric Frobenius acting on \\\\ell-adic √©tale cohomology with compact supports of \\\\overline{X}, the lift of X to the algebraic closure of the field F. This shows that the zeta function is a rational function of t. An infinite product formula for Z(X, t) is :Z(X, t)=\\\\prod\\\\ (1-t^{\\\\deg(x)})^{-1}. Here, the product ranges over all closed points x of X and deg(x) is the degree of x. The local zeta function Z(X, t) is viewed as a function of the complex variable s via the change of variables q‚àís. In the case where X is the variety V discussed above, the closed points are the equivalence classes x=[P] of points P on \\\\overline{V}, where two points are equivalent if they are conjugates over F. The degree of x is the degree of the field extension of F generated by the coordinates of P. The logarithmic derivative of the infinite product Z(X, t) is easily seen to be the generating function discussed above, namely :N_1 +N_2t^1 + N_3t^2 +\\\\cdots \\\\,.

There were other secret lodges already working in Buenos Aires: the anglophile lodges \\"Hiram sons\\" and \\"Southern Star\\", and the \\"Patriotic Society\\" that united the former supporters of Mariano Moreno. This last lodge, opposed to the first two ones, was integrated into the new one created by the Spanish generals.Galasso, pp.77-78 Name Although the lodge is most commonly known as \\"Lautaro\\", it did not employ that name during all of its existence. The name made reference to Mapuche leader Lautaro, which made sense in Santiago de Chile in the 1817-1820 period, but not in Buenos Aires in 1812 and much less in Europe.Galasso, p. 79 Historian Vicente Fidel L√≥pez points that \\"Lautaro\\" was really a masonic code meaning \\"Expedition to Chile\\", but similarly, Chile was not a military target for Buenos Aires in 1812. By that point, Chile was still in the Patria Vieja period, and would not fall into royalist control until the 1814 Disaster of Rancagua. Although the secrecy makes difficult to investigate the purposes or even the name, Alcib√≠ades Lappas considers instead that the lodge was named \\"Lodge of Rational Knights\\" in 1812, just like the C√°diz one, and that San Mart√≠n renamed it \\"Lautaro\\" when he recreated it in 1815, after the fall of Alvear.Galasso, pp. 79-80 Bibliography * References Category:Masonic Lodges Category:Jos√© de San Mart√≠n Category:Argentine War of Independence Category:Chilean War of Independence Category:Peninsular War ","title":"Lautaro Lodge"},{"id":"396022","text":"Flow around a wing. This incompressible flow satisfies the Euler equations. In fluid dynamics, the Euler equations are a set of quasilinear hyperbolic equations governing adiabatic and inviscid flow. They are named after Leonhard Euler. The equations represent Cauchy equations of conservation of mass (continuity), and balance of momentum and energy, and can be seen as particular Navier‚ÄìStokes equations with zero viscosity and zero thermal conductivity. In fact, Euler equations can be obtained by linearization of some more precise continuity equations like Navier‚ÄìStokes equations in a local equilibrium state given by a Maxwellian. The Euler equations can be applied to incompressible and to compressible flow ‚Äì assuming the flow velocity is a solenoidal field, or using another appropriate energy equation respectively (the simplest form for Euler equations being the conservation of the specific entropy). Historically, only the incompressible equations have been derived by Euler. However, fluid dynamics literature often refers to the full set ‚Äì including the energy equation ‚Äì of the more general compressible equations together as \\"the Euler equations\\". From the mathematical point of view, Euler equations are notably hyperbolic conservation equations in the case without external field (i.e., in the limit of high Froude number). In fact, like any Cauchy equation, the Euler equations originally formulated in convective form (also called \\"Lagrangian form\\") can also be put in the \\"conservation form\\" (also called \\"Eulerian form\\"). The conservation form emphasizes the mathematical interpretation of the equations as conservation equations through a control volume fixed in space, and is the most important for these equations also from a numerical point of view. The convective form emphasizes changes to the state in a frame of reference moving with the fluid. History The Euler equations first appeared in published form in Euler's article \\"Principes g√©n√©raux du mouvement des fluides\\", published in M√©moires de l'Acad√©mie des Sciences de Berlin in 1757 (in this article Euler actually published only the general form of the continuity equation and the momentum equation; the energy balance equation would be obtained a century later). They were among the first partial differential equations to be written down. At the time Euler published his work, the system of equations consisted of the momentum and continuity equations, and thus was underdetermined except in the case of an incompressible fluid. An additional equation, which was later to be called the adiabatic condition, was supplied by Pierre-Simon Laplace in 1816. During the second half of the 19th century, it was found that the equation related to the balance of energy must at all times be kept, while the adiabatic condition is a consequence of the fundamental laws in the case of smooth solutions. With the discovery of the special theory of relativity, the concepts of energy density, momentum density, and stress were unified into the concept of the stress‚Äìenergy tensor, and energy and momentum were likewise unified into a single concept, the energy‚Äìmomentum vector Incompressible Euler equations with constant and uniform density In convective form (i.e., the form with the convective operator made explicit in the momentum equation), the incompressible Euler equations in case of density constant in time and uniform in space are: where: *\\\\mathbf u is the flow velocity vector, with components in an N-dimensional space u_1, u_2, \\\\dots, u_N, *{D\\\\mathbf v \\\\over Dt}={\\\\partial\\\\mathbf v\\\\over\\\\partial t}+\\\\mathbf u\\\\cdot abla\\\\mathbf v, for a generic function (or field) \\\\mathbf v denotes its material derivative in time with respect to the advective field \\\\mathbf u and * abla denotes the gradient with respect to space, *\\\\cdot denotes the scalar product, * abla is the nabla operator, here used to represent the specific thermodynamic work gradient (first equation), and * abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf u is the flow velocity divergence (second equation), *w is the specific (with the sense of per unit mass) thermodynamic work, the internal source term. * \\\\mathbf{g} represents body accelerations (per unit mass) acting on the continuum, for example gravity, inertial accelerations, electric field acceleration, and so on. The first equation is the Euler momentum equation with uniform density (for this equation it could also not be constant in time). By expanding the material derivative, the equations become: :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{align} {\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{u} \\\\over \\\\partial t} + (\\\\mathbf{u} \\\\cdot abla) \\\\mathbf{u} &= - abla w + \\\\mathbf{g} \\\\\\\\\\\\ abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{u} &= 0 \\\\end{align}\\\\right. In fact for a flow with uniform density \\\\rho_0 the following identity holds: : abla w \\\\equiv abla \\\\left(\\\\frac p {\\\\rho_0} \\\\right) = \\\\frac 1 {\\\\rho_0} abla p where p is the mechanic pressure. The second equation is the incompressible constraint, stating the flow velocity is a solenoidal field (the order of the equations is not causal, but underlines the fact that the incompressible constraint is not a degenerate form of the continuity equation, but rather of the energy equation, as it will become clear in the following). Notably, the continuity equation would be required also in this incompressible case as an additional third equation in case of density varying in time or varying in space. For example, with density uniform but varying in time, the continuity equation to be added to the above set would correspond to: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\rho}{\\\\partial t} = 0 So the case of constant and uniform density is the only one not requiring the continuity equation as additional equation regardless of the presence or absence of the incompressible constraint. In fact, the case of incompressible Euler equations with constant and uniform density being analyzed is a toy model featuring only two simplified equations, so it is ideal for didactical purposes even if with limited physical relevancy. The equations above thus represent respectively conservation of mass (1 scalar equation) and momentum (1 vector equation containing N scalar components, where N is the physical dimension of the space of interest). Flow velocity and pressure are the so-called physical variables. In a coordinate system given by \\\\left(x_1, \\\\dots, x_N\\\\right) the velocity and external force vectors \\\\mathbf u and \\\\mathbf g have components (u_1,\\\\dots, u_N) and \\\\left(g_1, \\\\dots, g_N\\\\right), respectively. Then the equations may be expressed in subscript notation as: :Singularities\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{align} {\\\\partial u_i \\\\over \\\\partial t} + \\\\sum_{j=1}^N {\\\\partial \\\\left(u_i u_j + w\\\\delta_{ij}\\\\right) \\\\over \\\\partial x_j} &= g_i \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sum_{i=1}^N {\\\\partial u_i \\\\over \\\\partial x_i} &= 0 \\\\end{align}\\\\right. where the i and j subscripts label the N-dimensional space components, and \\\\delta_{ij} is the Kroenecker delta. The use of Einstein notation (where the sum is implied by repeated indices instead of sigma notation) is also frequent. =Properties= Although Euler first presented these equations in 1755, many fundamental questions about them remain unanswered. In three space dimensions, in certain simplified scenarios, the Euler equations produce singularities. arXiv:1904.04795 Smooth solutions of the free (in the sense of without source term: g=0) equations satisfy the conservation of specific kinetic energy: : {\\\\partial \\\\over\\\\partial t} \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2} u^2 \\\\right) + abla \\\\cdot \\\\left(u^2 \\\\mathbf u + w \\\\mathbf I\\\\right) = 0 In the one dimensional case without the source term (both pressure gradient and external force), the momentum equation becomes the inviscid Burgers equation: : {\\\\partial u \\\\over\\\\partial t}+ u {\\\\partial u \\\\over\\\\partial x} = 0 This is a model equation giving many insights on Euler equations. =Nondimensionalisation= In order to make the equations dimensionless, a characteristic length r_0, and a characteristic velocity u_0, need to be defined. These should be chosen such that the dimensionless variables are all of order one. The following dimensionless variables are thus obtained: : \\\\begin{align} u^* & \\\\equiv \\\\frac{u}{u_0}, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] r^* & \\\\equiv \\\\frac{r}{r_0}, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] t^* & \\\\equiv \\\\frac{u_0}{r_0} t, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] p^* & \\\\equiv \\\\frac{w}{u_0^2}, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] abla^* & \\\\equiv r_0 abla \\\\end{align} and of the field unit vector: : \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf g}\\\\equiv \\\\frac {\\\\mathbf g} g, Substitution of these inversed relations in Euler equations, defining the Froude number, yields (omitting the * at apix): \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{g}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{u} &= 0 \\\\end{align}\\\\right. cellpadding border border colour = #0073CF background colour=#F5FFFA }} Euler equations in the Froude limit (no external field) are named free equations and are conservative. The limit of high Froude numbers (low external field) is thus notable and can be studied with perturbation theory. =Conservation form= The conservation form emphasizes the mathematical properties of Euler equations, and especially the contracted form is often the most convenient one for computational fluid dynamics simulations. Computationally, there are some advantages in using the conserved variables. This gives rise to a large class of numerical methods called conservative methods. The free Euler equations are conservative, in the sense they are equivalent to a conservation equation: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf y}{\\\\partial t}+ abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf F ={\\\\mathbf 0}, or simply in Einstein notation: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial y_j}{\\\\partial t}+ \\\\frac{\\\\partial f_{ij}}{\\\\partial r_i}= 0_i, where the conservation quantity \\\\mathbf y in this case is a vector, and \\\\mathbf F is a flux matrix. This can be simply proved. At last Euler equations can be recast into the particular equation: =Spatial dimensions= For certain problems, especially when used to analyze compressible flow in a duct or in case the flow is cylindrically or spherically symmetric, the one-dimensional Euler equations are a useful first approximation. Generally, the Euler equations are solved by Riemann's method of characteristics. This involves finding curves in plane of independent variables (i.e., x and t) along which partial differential equations (PDEs) degenerate into ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Numerical solutions of the Euler equations rely heavily on the method of characteristics. Incompressible Euler equations In convective form the incompressible Euler equations in case of density variable in space are: where the additional variables are: *\\\\rho is the fluid mass density, *p is the pressure, p = \\\\rho w. The first equation, which is the new one, is the incompressible continuity equation. In fact the general continuity equation would be: :{\\\\partial \\\\rho \\\\over\\\\partial t} + \\\\mathbf u \\\\cdot abla \\\\rho + \\\\rho abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf u = 0 but here the last term is identically zero for the incompressibility constraint. =Conservation form= The incompressible Euler equations in the Froude limit are equivalent to a single conservation equation with conserved quantity and associated flux respectively: : {\\\\mathbf y}=\\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\rho \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\rho \\\\mathbf u \\\\\\\\\\\\0\\\\end{pmatrix}; \\\\qquad {\\\\mathbf F}=\\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\rho \\\\mathbf u\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rho \\\\mathbf u \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf u + p \\\\mathbf I\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\mathbf u\\\\end{pmatrix}. Here \\\\mathbf y has length N+2 and \\\\mathbf F has size (N+2)N. In general (not only in the Froude limit) Euler equations are expressible as: : \\\\frac {\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}\\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\rho \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\rho \\\\mathbf u \\\\\\\\\\\\0\\\\end{pmatrix}+ abla \\\\cdot \\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\rho \\\\mathbf u\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\rho \\\\mathbf u \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf u + p \\\\mathbf I\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf u\\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\rho \\\\mathbf g \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} =Conservation variables= The variables for the equations in conservation form are not yet optimised. In fact we could define: : {\\\\mathbf y}=\\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\rho \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf j \\\\\\\\\\\\0\\\\end{pmatrix}; \\\\qquad {\\\\mathbf F}=\\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\mathbf j \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac {1} \\\\rho \\\\, \\\\mathbf j \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf j+ p \\\\mathbf I\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac \\\\mathbf j \\\\rho \\\\end{pmatrix}. where: * \\\\mathbf j = \\\\rho \\\\mathbf u is the momentum density, a conservation variable. where: * \\\\mathbf f = \\\\rho \\\\mathbf g is the force density, a conservation variable. Euler equations In differential convective form, the compressible (and most general) Euler equations can be written shortly with the material derivative notation: {Dt} &= - abla\\\\left(\\\\frac{p}{\\\\rho}\\\\right) + \\\\mathbf{g} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[1.2ex] {De \\\\over Dt} &= -\\\\frac{p}{\\\\rho} abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{u} \\\\end{align}\\\\right. cellpadding border border colour = #FF0000 background colour = #ECFCF4 }} where the additional variables here is: *e is the specific internal energy (internal energy per unit mass). The equations above thus represent conservation of mass, momentum, and energy: the energy equation expressed in the variable internal energy allows to understand the link with the incompressible case, but it is not in the simplest form. Mass density, flow velocity and pressure are the so-called convective variables (or physical variables, or lagrangian variables), while mass density, momentum density and total energy density are the so-called conserved variables (also called eulerian, or mathematical variables). If one explicitates the material derivative the equations above are: :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{align} {\\\\partial\\\\rho \\\\over \\\\partial t} + \\\\mathbf{u} \\\\cdot abla\\\\rho + \\\\rho abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{u} &= 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[1.2ex] \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{u}}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\mathbf{u} \\\\cdot abla\\\\mathbf{u} + \\\\frac{ abla p}{\\\\rho} &= \\\\mathbf{g} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[1.2ex] {\\\\partial e \\\\over \\\\partial t} + \\\\mathbf{u} \\\\cdot abla e + \\\\frac{p}{\\\\rho} abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{u} &= 0 \\\\end{align} \\\\right. =Incompressible constraint (revisited)= Coming back to the incompressible case, it now becomes apparent that the incompressible constraint typical of the former cases actually is a particular form valid for incompressible flows of the energy equation, and not of the mass equation. In particular, the incompressible constraint corresponds to the following very simple energy equation: :{D e \\\\over D t} = 0 Thus for an incompressible inviscid fluid the specific internal energy is constant along the flow lines, also in a time-dependent flow. The pressure in an incompressible flow acts like a Lagrange multiplier, being the multiplier of the incompressible constraint in the energy equation, and consequently in incompressible flows it has no thermodynamic meaning. In fact, thermodynamics is typical of compressible flows and degenerates in incompressible flows. Basing on the mass conservation equation, one can put this equation in the conservation form: :{\\\\partial \\\\rho e \\\\over \\\\partial t} + abla \\\\cdot (\\\\rho e \\\\mathbf u) = 0 meaning that for an incompressible inviscid nonconductive flow a continuity equation holds for the internal energy. =Enthalpy conservation= Since by definition the specific enthalpy is: :h = e + \\\\frac p \\\\rho The material derivative of the specific internal energy can be expressed as: :{D e \\\\over Dt} = {D h \\\\over Dt} - \\\\frac 1 \\\\rho \\\\left({D p \\\\over Dt} - \\\\frac p \\\\rho {D \\\\rho \\\\over Dt} \\\\right) Then by substituting the momentum equation in this expression, one obtains: :{D e \\\\over Dt}= {D h \\\\over Dt} - \\\\frac 1 \\\\rho \\\\left(p abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf u + {D p \\\\over Dt} \\\\right) And by substituting the latter in the energy equation, one obtains that the enthalpy expression for the Euler energy equation: :{D h \\\\over Dt} = \\\\frac 1 \\\\rho {D p \\\\over Dt} In a reference frame moving with an inviscid and nonconductive flow, the variation of enthalpy directly corresponds to a variation of pressure. =Thermodynamics of ideal fluids= In thermodynamics the independent variables are the specific volume, and the specific entropy, while the specific energy is a function of state of these two variables. {v^2} \\\\cdot abla v - \\\\frac 1 {v^2} \\\\frac {\\\\partial v}{\\\\partial t} = - \\\\frac 1 v abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{u} And by multiplication: : {\\\\partial v \\\\over\\\\partial t}+\\\\mathbf u \\\\cdot abla v = v abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf u This equation is the only belonging to general continuum equations, so only this equation have the same form for example also in Navier-Stokes equations. On the other hand, the pressure in thermodynamics is the opposite of the partial derivative of the specific internal energy with respect to the specific volume: :p(v, s) = - {\\\\partial e(v, s) \\\\over \\\\partial v} since the internal energy in thermodynamics is a function of the two variables aforementioned, the pressure gradient contained into the momentum equation should be explicited as: :\\\\- abla p (v,s) = - \\\\frac {\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial v} abla v - \\\\frac {\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial s} abla s = \\\\frac {\\\\partial^2 e}{\\\\partial v^2} abla v + \\\\frac {\\\\partial^2 e}{\\\\partial v \\\\partial s} abla s It is convenient for brevity to switch the notation for the second order derivatives: : \\\\- abla p (v,s) = e_{vv} abla v + e_{vs} abla s Finally, the energy equation: :{D e \\\\over Dt} = - p v abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf u can be furtherly simplified in convective form by changing variable from specific energy to the specific entropy: in fact the first law of thermodynamics in local form can be written: :{D e \\\\over Dt} = T {D s \\\\over Dt} - p {D v \\\\over Dt} by substituting the material derivative of the internal energy, the energy equation becomes: :T {D s \\\\over Dt} + \\\\frac p {\\\\rho^2} \\\\left( {D \\\\rho \\\\over Dt} + \\\\rho abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf u \\\\right) = 0 now the term between parenthesis is identically zero according to the conservation of mass, then the Euler energy equation becomes simply: :{D s \\\\over Dt} = 0 style = border: 1px solid lightgray; width: 90%; headerstyle = text-align:left; }} For a thermodynamic fluid, the compressible Euler equations are consequently best written as: {Dt} &= ve_{vv} abla v + ve_{vs} abla s + \\\\mathbf{g} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[1.2ex] {Ds \\\\over Dt} &= 0 \\\\end{align}\\\\right. cellpadding border border colour = #FFFF00 background colour = #ECFCF4 }} where: * v is the specific volume * \\\\mathbf u is the flow velocity vector * s is the specific entropy In the general case and not only in the incompressible case, the energy equation means that for an inviscid thermodynamic fluid the specific entropy is constant along the flow lines, also in a time-dependent flow. Basing on the mass conservation equation, one can put this equation in the conservation form: :{\\\\partial \\\\rho s \\\\over \\\\partial t} + abla \\\\cdot (\\\\rho s \\\\mathbf u) = 0 meaning that for an inviscid nonconductive flow a continuity equation holds for the entropy. On the other hand, the two second- order partial derivatives of the specific internal energy in the momentum equation require the specification of the fundamental equation of state of the material considered, i.e. of the specific internal energy as function of the two variables specific volume and specific entropy: :e = e(v, s) The fundamental equation of state contains all the thermodynamic information about the system (Callen, 1985), exactly like the couple of a thermal equation of state together with a caloric equation of state. =Conservation form= The Euler equations in the Froude limit are equivalent to a single conservation equation with conserved quantity and associated flux respectively: :{\\\\mathbf y} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\rho \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf j \\\\\\\\\\\\ E^t \\\\end{pmatrix}; \\\\qquad {\\\\mathbf F} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\mathbf j \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac 1 \\\\rho \\\\mathbf j \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf j + p \\\\mathbf I \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left(E^t + p\\\\right) \\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho}\\\\mathbf{j} \\\\end{pmatrix}. where: * \\\\mathbf j = \\\\rho \\\\mathbf u is the momentum density, a conservation variable. * E^t = \\\\rho e + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\rho u^2 is the total energy density (total energy per unit volume). Here \\\\mathbf y has length N + 2 and \\\\mathbf F has size N(N + 2). In general (not only in the Froude limit) Euler equations are expressible as: where: * \\\\mathbf f = \\\\rho \\\\mathbf g is the force density, a conservation variable. We remark that also the Euler equation even when conservative (no external field, Froude limit) have no Riemann invariants in general. Some further assumptions are required However, we already mentioned that for a thermodynamic fluid the equation for the total energy density is equivalent to the conservation equation: :{\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial t} (\\\\rho s) + abla \\\\cdot (\\\\rho s \\\\mathbf u) = 0 Then the conservation equations in the case of a thermodynamic fluid are more simply expressed as: {\\\\rho}\\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{f} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} cellpadding border border colour = #FFFF00 background colour = #ECFCF4 }} where: * S = \\\\rho s is the entropy density, a thermodynamic conservation variable. Another possible form for the energy equation, being particularly useful for isobarics, is: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial H^t}{\\\\partial t} + abla \\\\cdot \\\\left(H^t \\\\mathbf u\\\\right) = \\\\mathbf u \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf f - \\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial t} where: *H^t = E^t + p = \\\\rho e + p + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\rho u^2 is the total enthalpy density. Quasilinear form and characteristic equations Expanding the fluxes can be an important part of constructing numerical solvers, for example by exploiting (approximate) solutions to the Riemann problem. In regions where the state vector y varies smoothly, the equations in conservative form can be put in quasilinear form : : \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf y}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\mathbf A_i \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf y}{\\\\partial r_i} = {\\\\mathbf 0}. where \\\\mathbf A_i are called the flux Jacobians defined as the matrices: : \\\\mathbf A_i (\\\\mathbf y)=\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf f_i (\\\\mathbf y)}{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf y}. Obviously this Jacobian does not exist in discontinuity regions (e.g. contact discontinuities, shock waves in inviscid nonconductive flows). If the flux Jacobians \\\\mathbf A_i are not functions of the state vector \\\\mathbf y, the equations reveals linear. =Characteristic equations= The compressible Euler equations can be decoupled into a set of N+2 wave equations that describes sound in Eulerian continuum if they are expressed in characteristic variables instead of conserved variables. In fact the tensor A is always diagonalizable. If the eigenvalues (the case of Euler equations) are all real the system is defined hyperbolic, and physically eigenvalues represent the speeds of propagation of information. If they are all distinguished, the system is defined strictly hyperbolic (it will be proved to be the case of one-dimensional Euler equations). Furthermore, diagonalisation of compressible Euler equation is easier when the energy equation is expressed in the variable entropy (i.e. with equations for thermodynamic fluids) than in other energy variables. This will become clear by considering the 1D case. If \\\\mathbf p_i is the right eigenvector of the matrix \\\\mathbf A corresponding to the eigenvalue \\\\lambda_i, by building the projection matrix: :\\\\mathbf{P} = \\\\left[\\\\mathbf{p}_1, \\\\mathbf{p}_2, ..., \\\\mathbf{p}_n\\\\right] One can finally find the characteristic variables as: :\\\\mathbf{w}= \\\\mathbf{P}^{-1}\\\\mathbf{y}, Since A is constant, multiplying the original 1-D equation in flux-Jacobian form with P‚àí1 yields the characteristic equations: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial w_i}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\lambda_j \\\\frac{\\\\partial w_i}{\\\\partial r_j} = 0_i The original equations have been decoupled into N+2 characteristic equations each describing a simple wave, with the eigenvalues being the wave speeds. The variables wi are called the characteristic variables and are a subset of the conservative variables. The solution of the initial value problem in terms of characteristic variables is finally very simple. In one spatial dimension it is: :w_i(x, t) = w_i\\\\left(x - \\\\lambda_i t, 0\\\\right) Then the solution in terms of the original conservative variables is obtained by transforming back: :\\\\mathbf{y} = \\\\mathbf{P} \\\\mathbf{w}, this computation can be explicited as the linear combination of the eigenvectors: :\\\\mathbf{y}(x, t) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^m w_i\\\\left(x - \\\\lambda_i t, 0\\\\right) \\\\mathbf p_i, Now it becomes apparent that the characteristic variables act as weights in the linear combination of the jacobian eigenvectors. The solution can be seen as superposition of waves, each of which is advected independently without change in shape. Each i-th wave has shape wipi and speed of propagation Œªi. In the following we show a very simple example of this solution procedure. =Waves in 1D inviscid, nonconductive thermodynamic fluid= If one considers Euler equations for a thermodynamic fluid with the two further assumptions of one spatial dimension and free (no external field: g = 0) : :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{align} {\\\\partial v \\\\over \\\\partial t} + u{\\\\partial v \\\\over \\\\partial x} - v {\\\\partial u \\\\over \\\\partial x} &= 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[1.2ex] {\\\\partial u \\\\over \\\\partial t} + u{\\\\partial u \\\\over \\\\partial x} - e_{vv} v {\\\\partial v \\\\over \\\\partial x} - e_{vs}v {\\\\partial s \\\\over \\\\partial x} &= 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[1.2ex] {\\\\partial s \\\\over \\\\partial t} + u{\\\\partial s \\\\over \\\\partial x} &= 0 \\\\end{align}\\\\right. If one defines the vector of variables: :\\\\mathbf{y} = \\\\begin{pmatrix}v \\\\\\\\\\\\ u \\\\\\\\\\\\ s\\\\end{pmatrix} recalling that v is the specific volume, u the flow speed, s the specific entropy, the corresponding jacobian matrix is: : {\\\\mathbf A}=\\\\begin{pmatrix}u & -v & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ - e_{vv} v & u & \\\\- e_{vs} v \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & u \\\\end{pmatrix}. At first one must find the eigenvalues of this matrix by solving the characteristic equation: : \\\\det(\\\\mathbf A(\\\\mathbf y) - \\\\lambda(\\\\mathbf y) \\\\mathbf I) = 0 that is explicitly: : \\\\det\\\\begin{bmatrix}u-\\\\lambda & -v & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ - e_{vv} v & u-\\\\lambda & \\\\- e_{vs} v \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & u-\\\\lambda \\\\end{bmatrix}=0 This determinant is very simple: the fastest computation starts on the last row, since it has the highest number of zero elements. : (u-\\\\lambda) \\\\det \\\\begin{bmatrix}u-\\\\lambda & -v \\\\\\\\\\\\ - e_{vv} v & u -\\\\lambda \\\\end{bmatrix}=0 Now by computing the determinant 2√ó2: : (u - \\\\lambda)\\\\left((u - \\\\lambda)^2 - e_{vv} v^2\\\\right) = 0 by defining the parameter: : a(v,s) \\\\equiv v \\\\sqrt {e_{vv}} or equivalently in mechanical variables, as: : a(\\\\rho,p) \\\\equiv \\\\sqrt {\\\\partial p \\\\over \\\\partial \\\\rho} This parameter is always real according to the second law of thermodynamics. In fact the second law of thermodynamics can be expressed by several postulates. The most elementary of them in mathematical terms is the statement of convexity of the fundamental equation of state, i.e. the hessian matrix of the specific energy expressed as function of specific volume and specific entropy: : \\\\begin{pmatrix}e_{vv} & e_{vs} \\\\\\\\\\\\ e_{vs} & e_{ss} \\\\end{pmatrix} is defined positive. This statement corresponds to the two conditions: :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{align} e_{vv} &> 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[1.2ex] e_{vv}e_{ss} - e_{vs}^2 &> 0 \\\\end{align}\\\\right. The first condition is the one ensuring the parameter a is defined real. The characteristic equation finally results: : (u - \\\\lambda)\\\\left((u - \\\\lambda)^2 - a^2\\\\right) = 0 That has three real solutions: : \\\\lambda_1(v,u,s) = u-a(v,s) \\\\quad \\\\lambda_2(u)= u, \\\\quad \\\\lambda_3(v,u,s) = u+a(v,s) Then the matrix has three real eigenvalues all distinguished: the 1D Euler equations are a strictly hyperbolic system. At this point one should determine the three eigenvectors: each one is obtained by substituting one eigenvalue in the eigenvalue equation and then solving it. By substituting the first eigenvalue Œª1 one obtains: : \\\\begin{pmatrix}a & -v & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ - e_{vv} v & a & \\\\- e_{vs} v \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & a \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix}v_1\\\\\\\\\\\\ u_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\s_1 \\\\end{pmatrix}=0 Basing on the third equation that simply has solution s1=0, the system reduces to: : \\\\begin{pmatrix}a & -v \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\-a^2 /v& a \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix}v_1\\\\\\\\\\\\ u_1 \\\\end{pmatrix}=0 The two equations are redundant as usual, then the eigenvector is defined with a multiplying constant. We choose as right eigenvector: : \\\\mathbf p_1=\\\\begin{pmatrix}v\\\\\\\\\\\\ a \\\\\\\\\\\\0\\\\end{pmatrix} The other two eigenvectors can be found with analogous procedure as: : \\\\mathbf p_2=\\\\begin{pmatrix} e_{vs} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ - \\\\left(\\\\frac a v \\\\right)^2 \\\\end{pmatrix}, \\\\qquad \\\\mathbf p_3=\\\\begin{pmatrix}v\\\\\\\\\\\\ -a \\\\\\\\\\\\0\\\\end{pmatrix} Then the projection matrix can be built: : \\\\mathbf P (v,u,s)=( \\\\mathbf{p}_1, \\\\mathbf{p}_2, \\\\mathbf{p}_3) =\\\\begin{pmatrix} v & e_{vs} & v\\\\\\\\\\\\ a & 0 & -a \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\- \\\\left(\\\\frac a v \\\\right)^2 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} Finally it becomes apparent that the real parameter a previously defined is the speed of propagation of the information characteristic of the hyperbolic system made of Euler equations, i.e. it is the wave speed. It remains to be shown that the sound speed corresponds to the particular case of an isoentropic transformation: :a_s \\\\equiv \\\\sqrt {\\\\left({\\\\partial p \\\\over \\\\partial \\\\rho} \\\\right)_s} =Compressibility and sound speed= Sound speed is defined as the wavespeed of an isentropic transformation: :a_s(\\\\rho,p) \\\\equiv \\\\sqrt {\\\\left({\\\\partial p \\\\over \\\\partial \\\\rho} \\\\right)_s} by the definition of the isoentropic compressibility: :K_s (\\\\rho,p) \\\\equiv \\\\frac 1 \\\\rho \\\\left({\\\\partial p \\\\over \\\\partial \\\\rho} \\\\right)_s the soundspeed results always the square root of ratio between the isoentropic compressibility and the density: :a_s \\\\equiv \\\\sqrt {\\\\frac {K_s} \\\\rho} Ideal gas The sound speed in an ideal gas depends only on its temperature: :a_s (T) = \\\\sqrt {\\\\gamma \\\\frac T m} Since the specific enthalpy in an ideal gas is proportional to its temperature: :h = c_p T = \\\\frac {\\\\gamma}{\\\\gamma-1} \\\\frac T m the sound speed in an ideal gas can also be made dependent only on its specific enthalpy: :a_s (h) = \\\\sqrt {(\\\\gamma -1) h} Bernoulli's theorem for steady inviscid flow Bernoulli's theorem is a direct consequence of the Euler equations. =Incompressible case and Lamb's form= The vector calculus identity of the cross product of a curl holds: : \\\\mathbf{v \\\\ \\\\times } \\\\left( \\\\mathbf{ abla \\\\times F} \\\\right) = abla_F \\\\left( \\\\mathbf{v \\\\cdot F } \\\\right) - \\\\mathbf{v \\\\cdot abla } \\\\mathbf{ F} \\\\ , where the Feynman subscript notation abla_F is used, which means the subscripted gradient operates only on the factor \\\\mathbf F. Lamb in his famous classical book Hydrodynamics (1895), still in print, used this identity to change the convective term of the flow velocity in rotational form: :\\\\mathbf u \\\\cdot abla \\\\mathbf u = \\\\frac{1}{2} abla\\\\left(u^2\\\\right) + ( abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf u) \\\\times \\\\mathbf u the Euler momentum equation in Lamb's form becomes: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{u}}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\frac{1}{2} abla\\\\left(u^2\\\\right) + ( abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{u}) \\\\times \\\\mathbf{u} + \\\\frac{ abla p}{\\\\rho} = \\\\mathbf{g} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{u}}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\frac{1}{2} abla\\\\left(u^2\\\\right) - \\\\mathbf{u} \\\\times ( abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{u}) + \\\\frac{ abla p}{\\\\rho} Now, basing on the other identity: : abla \\\\left( \\\\frac {p}{\\\\rho} \\\\right) = \\\\frac { abla p}{\\\\rho} - \\\\frac{p}{\\\\rho^2} abla \\\\rho the Euler momentum equation assumes a form that is optimal to demonstrate Bernoulli's theorem for steady flows: : abla \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2}u^2 + \\\\frac{p}{\\\\rho}\\\\right) - \\\\mathbf g = -\\\\frac{p}{\\\\rho^2} abla \\\\rho + \\\\mathbf u \\\\times ( abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf u) - \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf u}{\\\\partial t} In fact, in case of an external conservative field, by defining its potential œÜ: : abla \\\\left( \\\\frac 1 2 u^2 + \\\\phi + \\\\frac p \\\\rho \\\\right) = -\\\\frac{p}{\\\\rho^2} abla \\\\rho + \\\\mathbf u \\\\times ( abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf u) - \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf u}{\\\\partial t} In case of a steady flow the time derivative of the flow velocity disappears, so the momentum equation becomes: : abla \\\\left( \\\\frac 1 2 u^2 + \\\\phi + \\\\frac p \\\\rho \\\\right) = -\\\\frac{p}{\\\\rho^2} abla \\\\rho + \\\\mathbf u \\\\times ( abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf u) And by projecting the momentum equation on the flow direction, i.e. along a streamline, the cross product disappears because its result is always perpendicular to the velocity: :\\\\mathbf u \\\\cdot abla \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2}u^2 + \\\\phi + \\\\frac{p}{\\\\rho}\\\\right) = -\\\\frac{p}{\\\\rho^2} \\\\mathbf u \\\\cdot abla\\\\rho In the steady incompressible case the mass equation is simply: :\\\\mathbf u \\\\cdot abla \\\\rho = 0, that is the mass conservation for a steady incompressible flow states that the density along a streamline is constant. Then the Euler momentum equation in the steady incompressible case becomes: :\\\\mathbf u \\\\cdot abla \\\\left( \\\\frac 1 2 u^2 + \\\\phi + \\\\frac p \\\\rho \\\\right) = 0 The convenience of defining the total head for an inviscid liquid flow is now apparent: : b_l \\\\equiv \\\\frac 1 2 u^2 + \\\\phi + \\\\frac p \\\\rho , which may be simply written as: :\\\\mathbf u \\\\cdot abla b_l = 0 That is, the momentum balance for a steady inviscid and incompressible flow in an external conservative field states that the total head along a streamline is constant. =Compressible case = In the most general steady (compressibile) case the mass equation in conservation form is: : abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf j = \\\\rho abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf u + \\\\mathbf u \\\\cdot abla \\\\rho = 0 . Therefore, the previous expression is rather :\\\\mathbf{u} \\\\cdot abla \\\\left({\\\\frac{1}{2}}u^2 + \\\\phi + \\\\frac{p}{\\\\rho}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{p}{\\\\rho} abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{u} The right-hand side appears on the energy equation in convective form, which on the steady state reads: :\\\\mathbf u \\\\cdot abla e = - \\\\frac{p}{\\\\rho} abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf u The energy equation therefore becomes: :\\\\mathbf u \\\\cdot abla \\\\left( e + \\\\frac p \\\\rho + \\\\frac 1 2 u^2 + \\\\phi \\\\right) = 0, so that the internal specific energy now features in the head. Since the external field potential is usually small compared to the other terms, it is convenient to group the latter ones in the total enthalpy: : h^t \\\\equiv e + \\\\frac p \\\\rho + \\\\frac 1 2 u^2 and the Bernoulli invariant for an inviscid gas flow is: : b_g \\\\equiv h^t + \\\\phi = b_l + e , which can be written as: :\\\\mathbf u \\\\cdot abla b_g = 0 That is, the energy balance for a steady inviscid flow in an external conservative field states that the sum of the total enthalpy and the external potential is constant along a streamline. In the usual case of small potential field, simply: :\\\\mathbf u \\\\cdot abla h^t \\\\sim 0 =Friedmann form and Crocco form= By substituting the pressure gradient with the entropy and enthalpy gradient, according to the first law of thermodynamics in the enthalpy form: :v abla p = -T abla s + abla h in the convective form of Euler momentum equation, one arrives to: :\\\\frac{D\\\\mathbf u}{Dt}=T abla\\\\,s- abla \\\\,h Friedmann deduced this equation for the particular case of a perfect gas and published it in 1922. However, this equation is general for an inviscid nonconductive fluid and no equation of state is implicit in it. On the other hand, by substituting the enthalpy form of the first law of thermodynamics in the rotational form of Euler momentum equation, one obtains: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf{u}}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\frac{1}{2} abla\\\\left(u^2\\\\right) + ( abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{u}) \\\\times \\\\mathbf{u} + \\\\frac{ abla p}{\\\\rho} = \\\\mathbf{g} and by defining the specific total enthalpy: :h^t = h + \\\\frac{1}{2}u^2 one arrives to the Crocco‚ÄìVazsonyi form (Crocco, 1937) of the Euler momentum equation: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{ u}}{\\\\partial t} + ( abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf u) \\\\times \\\\mathbf u - T abla s + abla h^t = \\\\mathbf{g} In the steady case the two variables entropy and total enthalpy are particularly useful since Euler equations can be recast into the Crocco's form: :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{u} \\\\times abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{u} + T abla s - abla h^t &= \\\\mathbf{g} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{u} \\\\cdot abla s &= 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{u} \\\\cdot abla h^t &= 0 \\\\end{align}\\\\right. Finally if the flow is also isothermal: :T abla s = abla (T s) by defining the specific total Gibbs free energy: : g^t \\\\equiv h^t + Ts the Crocco's form can be reduced to: :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{u} \\\\times abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{u} - abla g^t &= \\\\mathbf{g} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{u} \\\\cdot abla g^t &= 0 \\\\end{align}\\\\right. From these relationships one deduces that the specific total free energy is uniform in a steady, irrotational, isothermal, isoentropic, inviscid flow. Discontinuities The Euler equations are quasilinear hyperbolic equations and their general solutions are waves. Under certain assumptions they can be simplified leading to Burgers equation. Much like the familiar oceanic waves, waves described by the Euler Equations 'break' and so-called shock waves are formed; this is a nonlinear effect and represents the solution becoming multi- valued. Physically this represents a breakdown of the assumptions that led to the formulation of the differential equations, and to extract further information from the equations we must go back to the more fundamental integral form. Then, weak solutions are formulated by working in 'jumps' (discontinuities) into the flow quantities ‚Äì density, velocity, pressure, entropy ‚Äì using the Rankine‚ÄìHugoniot equations. Physical quantities are rarely discontinuous; in real flows, these discontinuities are smoothed out by viscosity and by heat transfer. (See Navier‚ÄìStokes equations) Shock propagation is studied ‚Äì among many other fields ‚Äì in aerodynamics and rocket propulsion, where sufficiently fast flows occur. To properly compute the continuum quantities in discontinuous zones (for example shock waves or boundary layers) from the local forms (all the above forms are local forms, since the variables being described are typical of one point in the space considered, i.e. they are local variables) of Euler equations through finite difference methods generally too many space points and time steps would be necessary for the memory of computers now and in the near future. In these cases it is mandatory to avoid the local forms of the conservation equations, passing some weak forms, like the finite volume one. =Rankine‚ÄìHugoniot equations= Starting from the simplest case, one consider a steady free conservation equation in conservation form in the space domain: : abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf F = \\\\mathbf 0 where in general F is the flux matrix. By integrating this local equation over a fixed volume Vm, it becomes: : \\\\int_{V_m} abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf F dV = \\\\mathbf 0. Then, basing on the divergence theorem, we can transform this integral in a boundary integral of the flux: : \\\\oint_{\\\\partial V_m} \\\\mathbf F ds = \\\\mathbf 0. This global form simply states that there is no net flux of a conserved quantity passing through a region in the case steady and without source. In 1D the volume reduces to an interval, its boundary being its extrema, then the divergence theorem reduces to the fundamental theorem of calculus: : \\\\int_{x_m}^{x_{m+1}} \\\\mathbf F\\\\left(x'\\\\right) dx' = \\\\mathbf 0, that is the simple finite difference equation, known as the jump relation: : \\\\Delta \\\\mathbf F = \\\\mathbf 0. That can be made explicit as: : \\\\mathbf F_{m+1} - \\\\mathbf F_m = \\\\mathbf 0 where the notation employed is: : \\\\mathbf F_{m} = \\\\mathbf F(x_m). Or, if one performs an indefinite integral: : \\\\mathbf F - \\\\mathbf F_0 = \\\\mathbf 0. On the other hand, a transient conservation equation: :{\\\\partial y \\\\over \\\\partial t} + abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf F = \\\\mathbf 0 brings to a jump relation: : \\\\frac{dx}{dt} \\\\, \\\\Delta u = \\\\Delta \\\\mathbf F. For one-dimensional Euler equations the conservation variables and the flux are the vectors: :\\\\mathbf y = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\frac{1}{v} \\\\\\\\\\\\ j \\\\\\\\\\\\ E^t \\\\end{pmatrix}, :\\\\mathbf F = \\\\begin{pmatrix} j \\\\\\\\\\\\ v j^2 + p \\\\\\\\\\\\ v j \\\\left(E^t + p\\\\right) \\\\end{pmatrix}, where: * v is the specific volume, * j is the mass flux. In the one dimensional case the correspondent jump relations, called the Rankine‚ÄìHugoniot equations, are:< : \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{dx}{dt}\\\\Delta \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{v}\\\\right) &= \\\\Delta j\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[1.2ex] \\\\frac{dx}{dt}\\\\Delta j &= \\\\Delta\\\\left(vj^2 + p\\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[1.2ex] \\\\frac{dx}{dt}\\\\Delta E^t &= \\\\Delta \\\\left(jv\\\\left(E^t + p\\\\right)\\\\right) \\\\end{align}\\\\right. . In the steady one dimensional case the become simply: : \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{align} \\\\Delta j &= 0\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[1.2ex] \\\\Delta\\\\left(v j^2 + p\\\\right) &= 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[1.2ex] \\\\Delta\\\\left(j\\\\left(\\\\frac{E^t}{\\\\rho} + \\\\frac{p}{\\\\rho}\\\\right)\\\\right) &= 0 \\\\end{align}\\\\right. . Thanks to the mass difference equation, the energy difference equation can be simplified without any restriction: :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{align} \\\\Delta j &= 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[1.2ex] \\\\Delta\\\\left(vj^2 + p\\\\right) &= 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[1.2ex] \\\\Delta h^t &= 0 \\\\end{align}\\\\right., where h^t is the specific total enthalpy. These are the usually expressed in the convective variables: :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{align} \\\\Delta j &= 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[1.2ex] \\\\Delta\\\\left(\\\\frac{u^2}{v} + p\\\\right) &= 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[1.2ex] \\\\Delta\\\\left(e + \\\\frac{1}{2}u^2 + pv\\\\right) &= 0 \\\\end{align}\\\\right., where: * u is the flow speed * e is the specific internal energy. The energy equation is an integral form of the Bernoulli equation in the compressible case. The former mass and momentum equations by substitution lead to the Rayleigh equation: : \\\\frac{\\\\Delta p}{\\\\Delta v} = - \\\\frac {u_0^2}{v_0}. Since the second term is a constant, the Rayleigh equation always describes a simple line in the pressure volume plane not depending of any equation of state, i.e. the Rayleigh line. By substitution in the Rankine‚ÄìHugoniot equations, that can be also made explicit as: : \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{align} \\\\rho u &= \\\\rho_0 u_0 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[1.2ex] \\\\rho u^2 + p &= \\\\rho_0 u_0^2 + p_0 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[1.2ex] e + \\\\frac{1}{2}u^2 + \\\\frac{p}{\\\\rho} &= e_0 + \\\\frac{1}{2}u_0^2 + \\\\frac{p_0}{\\\\rho_0} \\\\end{align}\\\\right. . One can also obtain the kinetic equation and to the Hugoniot equation. The analytical passages are not shown here for brevity. These are respectively: : \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{align} u^2(v, p) &= u_0^2 + \\\\left(p - p_0\\\\right)\\\\left(v_0 + v\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[1.2ex] e(v, p) &= e_0 + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left(p + p_0\\\\right)\\\\left(v_0 - v\\\\right) \\\\end{align}\\\\right. . The Hugoniot equation, coupled with the fundamental equation of state of the material: : e = e(v,p) describes in general in the pressure volume plane a curve passing by the conditions (v0, p0), i.e. the Hugoniot curve, whose shape strongly depends on the type of material considered. It is also customary to define a Hugoniot function: : \\\\mathfrak h (v,s) \\\\equiv e(v,s) - e_0 + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left(p(v,s) + p_0\\\\right)\\\\left(v - v_0\\\\right) allowing to quantify deviations from the Hugoniot equation, similarly to the previous definition of the hydraulic head, useful for the deviations from the Bernoulli equation. =Finite volume form= On the other hand, by integrating a generic conservation equation: : \\\\frac {\\\\partial \\\\mathbf y}{\\\\partial t} + abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf F = \\\\mathbf s on a fixed volume Vm, and then basing on the divergence theorem, it becomes: : \\\\frac {d}{dt} \\\\int_{V_m} \\\\mathbf y dV + \\\\oint_{\\\\partial V_m} \\\\mathbf F \\\\cdot \\\\hat n ds = \\\\mathbf S . By integrating this equation also over a time interval: : \\\\int_{V_m} \\\\mathbf y(\\\\mathbf r, t_{n+1}) \\\\, dV - \\\\int_{V_m} \\\\mathbf y(\\\\mathbf r, t_n) \\\\, dV+ \\\\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} \\\\oint_{\\\\partial V_m} \\\\mathbf F \\\\cdot \\\\hat n \\\\, ds \\\\, dt = \\\\mathbf 0 . Now by defining the node conserved quantity: : \\\\mathbf y_{m,n} \\\\equiv \\\\frac 1 {V_m} \\\\int_{V_m} \\\\mathbf y(\\\\mathbf r, t_n) \\\\, dV , we deduce the finite volume form: : \\\\mathbf{y}_{m,n+1}=\\\\mathbf{y}_{m,n} - \\\\frac{1}{V_m} \\\\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} \\\\oint_{\\\\partial V_m} \\\\mathbf{F} \\\\cdot \\\\hat{n}\\\\, ds \\\\, dt . In particular, for Euler equations, once the conserved quantities have been determined, the convective variables are deduced by back substitution: : \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf u_{m,n} &= \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf j_{m,n}}{\\\\rho_{m,n}} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[1.2ex] e_{m,n} &= \\\\frac{E^t_{m,n}}{\\\\rho_{m,n}} - \\\\frac{1}{2}u^2_{m,n} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[1.2ex] \\\\end{align}\\\\right. . Then the explicit finite volume expressions of the original convective variables are:< \\\\oint_{\\\\partial V_m}\\\\rho\\\\mathbf{u} \\\\cdot \\\\hat{n}\\\\, ds\\\\, dt \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[1.2ex] \\\\mathbf u_{m,n+1} &= \\\\mathbf u_{m,n} - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho_{m,n} V_m}\\\\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}}\\\\oint_{\\\\partial V_m} (\\\\rho\\\\mathbf{u} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{u} - p\\\\mathbf{I}) \\\\cdot \\\\hat{n}\\\\, ds\\\\, dt \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[1.2ex] \\\\mathbf e_{m,n+1} &= \\\\mathbf e_{m,n} - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(u^2_{m,n+1} - u^2_{m,n}\\\\right) - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho_{m,n} V_m}\\\\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}}\\\\oint_{\\\\partial V_m} \\\\left(\\\\rho e + \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\rho u^2 + p\\\\right)\\\\mathbf{u} \\\\cdot \\\\hat{n}\\\\, ds\\\\, dt \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[1.2ex] \\\\end{align}\\\\right. . cellpadding border border colour = #FF0000 background colour = #ECFCF4 }} Constraints It has been shown that Euler equations are not a complete set of equations, but they require some additional constraints to admit a unique solution: these are the equation of state of the material considered. To be consistent with thermodynamics these equations of state should satisfy the two laws of thermodynamics. On the other hand, by definition non-equilibrium system are described by laws lying outside these laws. In the following we list some very simple equations of state and the corresponding influence on Euler equations. =Ideal polytropic gas= For an ideal polytropic gas the fundamental equation of state is: :e(v, s) = e_0 e^{(\\\\gamma-1)m\\\\left(s-s_0\\\\right)} \\\\left({v_0 \\\\over v}\\\\right)^{\\\\gamma-1} where e is the specific energy, v is the specific volume, s is the specific entropy, m is the molecular mass, \\\\gamma here is considered a constant (polytropic process), and can be shown to correspond to the heat capacity ratio. This equation can be shown to be consistent with the usual equations of state employed by thermodynamics. From this equation one can derive the equation for pressure by its thermodynamic definition: :p(v,e) \\\\equiv - {\\\\partial e \\\\over \\\\partial v} = (\\\\gamma - 1) \\\\frac e v By inverting it one arrives to the mechanical equation of state: :e(v,p) = \\\\frac {pv}{\\\\gamma - 1} Then for an ideal gas the compressible Euler equations can be simply expressed in the mechanical or primitive variables specific volume, flow velocity and pressure, by taking the set of the equations for a thermodynamic system and modifying the energy equation into a pressure equation through this mechanical equation of state. At last, in convective form they result: {Dt} &= v abla p + \\\\mathbf{g} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[1.2ex] {Dp \\\\over Dt} &= -\\\\gamma p abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{u} \\\\end{align}\\\\right. cellpadding border border colour = #FF00FF background colour = #ECFCF4 }} and in one-dimensional quasilinear form they results: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf y}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\mathbf A \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf y}{\\\\partial x} = {\\\\mathbf 0}. where the conservative vector variable is: :{\\\\mathbf y}=\\\\begin{pmatrix}v\\\\\\\\\\\\ u \\\\\\\\\\\\p \\\\end{pmatrix} and the corresponding jacobian matrix is: : {\\\\mathbf A}=\\\\begin{pmatrix}u & -v & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & u & v \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\gamma p & u \\\\end{pmatrix}. = Steady flow in material coordinates = In the case of steady flow, it is convenient to choose the Frenet‚ÄìSerret frame along a streamline as the coordinate system for describing the steady momentum Euler equation: : \\\\boldsymbol{u}\\\\cdot abla \\\\boldsymbol{u} = - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho} abla p, where \\\\mathbf u, p and \\\\rho denote the flow velocity, the pressure and the density, respectively. Let \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathbf e_s, \\\\mathbf e_n, \\\\mathbf e_b \\\\right\\\\\\\\} be a Frenet‚ÄìSerret orthonormal basis which consists of a tangential unit vector, a normal unit vector, and a binormal unit vector to the streamline, respectively. Since a streamline is a curve that is tangent to the velocity vector of the flow, the left-hand side of the above equation, the convective derivative of velocity, can be described as follows: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\boldsymbol{u}\\\\cdot abla \\\\boldsymbol{u} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= u\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial s}(u\\\\boldsymbol{e}_s) &(\\\\boldsymbol{u} = u \\\\boldsymbol{e}_s,~ {\\\\partial / \\\\partial s} \\\\equiv \\\\boldsymbol{e}_s \\\\cdot abla) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= u\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial s}\\\\boldsymbol{e}_s + \\\\frac{u^2}{R}\\\\boldsymbol{e}_n &(\\\\because~ \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\boldsymbol{e}_s}{\\\\partial s} = \\\\frac{1}{R}\\\\boldsymbol{e}_n), \\\\end{align} where R is the radius of curvature of the streamline. Therefore, the momentum part of the Euler equations for a steady flow is found to have a simple form: :\\\\begin{cases} \\\\displaystyle u\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial s} = -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho}\\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial s},\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\displaystyle {u^2 \\\\over R} = -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho}\\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial n} &({\\\\partial / \\\\partial n}\\\\equiv\\\\boldsymbol{e}_n\\\\cdot abla),\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\displaystyle 0 = -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\rho}\\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial b} &({\\\\partial / \\\\partial b}\\\\equiv\\\\boldsymbol{e}_b\\\\cdot abla). \\\\end{cases} For barotropic flow (\\\\rho = \\\\rho(p)), Bernoulli's equation is derived from the first equation: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial s}\\\\left(\\\\frac{u^2}{2} + \\\\int\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}p}{\\\\rho}\\\\right) = 0. The second equation expresses that, in the case the streamline is curved, there should exist a pressure gradient normal to the streamline because the centripetal acceleration of the fluid parcel is only generated by the normal pressure gradient. The third equation expresses that pressure is constant along the binormal axis.  Streamline curvature theorem  frameright The \\"Streamline curvature theorem\\" states that the pressure at the upper surface of an airfoil is lower than the pressure far away and that the pressure at the lower surface is higher than the pressure far away; hence the pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces of an airfoil generates a lift force. Let r be the distance from the center of curvature of the streamline, then the second equation is written as follows: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial r} = \\\\rho \\\\frac{u^2}{r}~(>0), where {\\\\partial / \\\\partial r} = -{\\\\partial /\\\\partial n}. This equation states: > '' In a steady flow of an inviscid fluid without external forces, the center > of curvature of the streamline lies in the direction of decreasing radial > pressure. Although this relationship between the pressure field and flow curvature is very useful, it doesn't have a name in the English-language scientific literature. Japanese fluid-dynamicists call the relationship the \\"Streamline curvature theorem\\". This \\"theorem\\" explains clearly why there are such low pressures in the centre of vortices, which consist of concentric circles of streamlines. This also is a way to intuitively explain why airfoils generate lift forces. Exact solutions All potential flow solutions are also solutions of the Euler equations, and in particular the incompressible Euler equations when the potential is harmonic. A two-dimensional parallel shear- flow. Solutions to the Euler equations with vorticity are: * parallel shear flows ‚Äì where the flow is unidirectional, and the flow velocity only varies in the cross-flow directions, e.g. in a Cartesian coordinate system (x,y,z) the flow is for instance in the x-direction ‚Äì with the only non-zero velocity component being u_x(y,z) only dependent on y and z and not on x. * Arnold‚ÄìBeltrami‚ÄìChildress flow ‚Äì an exact solution of the incompressible Euler equations. * Two solutions of the three-dimensional Euler equations with cylindrical symmetry have been presented by Gibbon, Moore and Stuart in 2003. These two solutions have infinite energy; they blow up everywhere in space in finite time.

It is named after the similar bell historically used by herdsmen to keep track of the whereabouts of cows.  Origins  A set of tuned cowbells. While the cowbell is commonly found in musical contexts, its origin can be traced to freely roaming animals. In order to help identify the herd to which these animals belonged, herdsmen placed these bells around the animal's neck. As the animals moved about the bell would ring, thus making it easier to know of the animal's whereabouts. Though the bells were used on various types of animals, they are typically referred to as \\"cowbells\\" due to their extensive use with cattle. Tuned cowbells Tuned cowbells or Almglocken (their German name), sometimes known by the English translation alpine bells (also Alpenglocken in German), typically refer to bulbous brass bells that are used to play music, sometimes as a novelty act or tourist attraction in the northern Alps, and sometimes in classical music, as in Richard Strauss's Alpine Symphony. Since they are tuned differently, in order to distinguish individual animals, they can be collected \\"from the pasture\\" in random tunings, but commercial sets in equal temperament are also available. The metal clapper is retained, and they sound much noisier than handbells, which are otherwise used similarly in ensembles.

In several parts of the world (notably in West Africa) pairs or trios of clapperless bells are joined in such a way that they can be struck separately or clashed together. The Brazilian name for these is \\"agogo\\" bells. Cylindrical wood blocks played in the same way are also called \\"Agog√¥\\". In Cuban music the cowbell is called cencerro and often played by the same player as the bongos. In Caribbean music two or three are often mounted together with a pair of timbales. This type of cowbell can also be played with the foot using a modified bass drum pedal or bowed with a double bass bow.  Sports use  Cowbells are sometimes popular noisemakers at sporting events, despite attempts to suppress them. While different sports teams seem to have their own story explaining the use of cowbells at their games, it is unlikely that so many teams across varying levels of sports and geographical regions would not have a common cultural reason for the practice. Although the origin of cowbell noisemakers is unclear, the most plausible explanation has to do with early baseball. Baseball games in the 19th Century were often played in cow pastures, as American society was agrarian-based at the time. Cowbells were easily found or taken from around the necks of cows in the pasture and were utilized as noisemakers. The tradition naturally grew to be common practice at various sporting events, not just baseball.\\"Baseball: The People's Game:, Seymour, Harold; Oxford University Press, 1991 In the United States, they are most closely identified with the Columbus Clippers minor league baseball team in Ohio and Mississippi State University, whose football fans once smuggled in cowbells by the thousands despite a ban on artificial noisemakers by its conference, the Southeastern Conference. SEC guidelines were changed in 2010 to permit limited cowbell use at Mississippi State football games, and again in 2014 to permit cowbells to be freely rung at any time except between the time that the offensive center is over the football until the play is whistled dead. Elsewhere in college football, the cowbell can be found at Penn State and Michigan football games, where it is played with a particular rhythm and accompanying chant. Worldwide, in cross-country skiing, cowbells are often rung vigorously at the start and finishes of races, to cheer on the racers. They are used by cyclocross fans in much the same way. Cornell ice hockey fans who are also known for their zealous support of their team have cheers that feature use of a cowbell while in Lynah Rink. The San Jose SaberCats of the Arena Football League are also infamous for their fans' use of cowbells. In New Zealand, supporters of the Waikato Rugby Union invariably use cowbells at home matches; this has been carried over to home matches of the Chiefs, the Super Rugby franchise centered on the Waikato region. During University of New Hampshire ice hockey games, a small group of fans at the base of the student section show their support for the UNH Wildcats with a cowbell. This group also leads the chants and shows their support with posters and other props. Finally the 2006‚Äì2007 American Basketball Association (ABA) champion Vermont Frost Heaves have a large cowbell following at their home games. A small number of Toronto Blue Jays fans at Rogers Centre frequently bring cowbells to Blue Jays home games. They are common enough at Tampa Bay Rays home games that the stadium scoreboard graphics crew have a pre-built graphic that says \\"More Cowbell!!\\". The Everett Silvertips fans also use cowbells, after the team watched the Saturday Night Live skit while on their tour bus in their inaugural season, and said they wanted the fans to have cowbells. They have a \\"more cowbell\\" that sometimes shows on the jumbotron. The Belleville Bulls in the Ontario Hockey League used the skit on their video scoreboard and \\"More Cowbell\\" as a catchphrase during the 2007 playoffs. Their goalie Edward Pasquale has several Will Ferrell characters painted on his goalie mask, including the one from the Saturday Night Live skit with the cowbell and others. The cowbell has become a tradition for the Melbourne Storm fans in the NRL and is rung by a group of 3 people in the active supporter bay behind the goals at AAMI Park, as well as a few other people around the ground. The supporters of Huddersfield Giants also have a small, enthusiastic group of fans known as \\"the cowbell army\\" who try and create a fun and friendly atmosphere at home and away games in the Super League.  In popular culture  \\"More cowbell\\" is an American catchphrase spoken as a humorous recommendation for improving a music performance. The phrase originated from a comedy sketch that aired on Saturday Night Live on April 8, 2000.

He was a colleague of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and expanded and defended Lamarck's evolutionary theories. Geoffroy's scientific views had a transcendental flavor (unlike Lamarck's materialistic views) and were similar to those of German morphologists like Lorenz Oken. He believed in the underlying unity of organismal design, and the possibility of the transmutation of species in time, amassing evidence for his claims through research in comparative anatomy, paleontology, and embryology. Life and early career Geoffroy was born at √âtampes (in present-day Essonne), and studied at the Coll√®ge de Navarre, in Paris, where he studied natural philosophy under M. J. Brisson. He then attended the lectures of Daubenton at the College de France and Fourcroy at the Jardin des Plantes. In March 1793 Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton, through the interest of Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, procured him the office of sub- keeper and assistant demonstrator of the cabinet of natural history, made vacant by the resignation of Bernard Germain √âtienne de la Ville, Comte de Lac√©p√®de. By a law passed in June 1793, Geoffroy was appointed one of the twelve professors of the newly constituted Mus√©um National d'Histoire Naturelle, being assigned the chair of zoology. In the same year he busied himself with the formation of a menagerie at that institution. In 1794, Geoffroy entered into correspondence with Georges Cuvier. Shortly after the appointment of Cuvier as assistant at the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle, Geoffroy received him into his house. The two friends wrote together five memoirs on natural history, one of which, on the classification of mammals, puts forward the idea of the subordination of characters upon which Cuvier based his zoological system. It was in a paper entitled Histoire des Makis, ou singes de Madagascar, written in 1795, that Geoffroy first gave expression to his views on the unity of organic composition, the influence of which is perceptible in all his subsequent writings; nature, he observes, presents us with only one plan of construction, the same in principle, but varied in its accessory parts. In 1798, Geoffroy was chosen a member of Napoleon's great scientific expedition to Egypt as part of the natural history and physics section of the Institut d'√âgypte; 151Laissus, Yves; Orgogozgo, Chantal (1990). The Discovery of Egypt. Paris: Flammarion. pp. 73-74. scientists and artists participated in the expedition, including Dominique-Vivant Denon, Claude Louis Berthollet, and Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier. On the capitulation of Alexandria in August 1801, he took part in resisting the claim made by the British general to the collections of the expedition, declaring that, were that demand persisted in, history would have to record that he also had burnt a library in Alexandria. Early in January 1802 Geoffroy returned to Paris. He was elected a member of the French Academy of Sciences in September 1807. In March of the following year Napoleon, who had already recognized his national services by the award of the cross of the legion of honor, selected him to visit the museums of Portugal, for the purpose of procuring collections from them, and in the face of considerable opposition from the British he eventually was successful in retaining them as a permanent possession for his country. Later career In 1809, the year after his return to France, Geoffroy was made professor of zoology at the faculty of sciences at Paris, and from that period he devoted himself more exclusively than before to anatomical study. In 1818 he published the first part of his celebrated Philosophie anatomique, the second volume of which, published in 1822, and subsequent memoirs account for the formation of monstrosities on the principle of arrest of development, and of the attraction of similar parts. Cuvier in the background, by Jean Ignace Isidore G√©rard Grandville, 1842 Geoffroy's friend Robert Edmund Grant shared his views on unity of plan and corresponded with him while working on marine invertebrates in the late 1820s in Edinburgh (assisted in 1826 and 1827 by his student Charles Darwin) when Grant successfully identified the pancreas in molluscs. When, in 1830, Geoffroy proceeded to apply to the invertebrata his views as to the unity of animal composition, he found a vigorous opponent in Cuvier, his former friend. Geoffroy, a synthesiser, contended, in accordance with his theory of unity of plan in organic composition, that all animals are formed of the same elements, in the same number; and with the same connections: homologous parts, however they differ in form and size, must remain associated in the same invariable order. With Johann Wolfgang von Goethe he held that there is in nature a law of compensation or balancing of growth, so that if one organ take on an excess of development, it is at the expense of some other part; and he maintained that, since nature takes no sudden leaps, even organs which are superfluous in any given species, if they have played an important part in other species of the same family, are retained as rudiments, which testify to the permanence of the general plan of creation. It was his conviction that, owing to the conditions of life, the same forms had not been perpetuated since the origin of all things, although it was not his belief that existing species are becoming modified. Cuvier, who was an analytical observer of facts, admitted only the prevalence of laws of co-existence or harmony in animal organs, and maintained the absolute invariability of species, which he declared had been created with a regard to the circumstances in which they were placed, each organ contrived with a view to the function it had to fulfil, thus putting, in Geoffroy's considerations, the effect for the cause. In 1836 he coined the term phocomelia. In July 1840, Geoffroy became blind, and some months later he had a paralytic attack. From that time his strength gradually failed him. He resigned his chair at the museum in 1841, and was succeeded by his son, Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. He died in 1844. Geoffroy's theory Geoffroy was a deist, which is to say that he believed in a God, but also in a law-like universe, with no supernatural interference in the details of existence. This kind of opinion was common in the Enlightenment, and goes with a rejection of revelation and miracles, and does not interpret the Bible as the literal word of God. These views did not conflict with his naturalistic ideas about organic change. Geoffroy's theory was not a theory of common descent, but a working-out of existing potential in a given type. For him, the environment causes a direct induction of organic change. This opinion Ernst Mayr labels as 'Geoffroyism'.Mayr, Ernst (1982). The Growth of Biological Thought: Diversity, Evolution, and Inheritance. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. p. 262. It is definitely not what Lamarck believed (for Lamarck, a change in habits is what changes the animal). The direct effect of environment on heritable traits is not believed today to be a central evolutionary force; even Lawrence knew by 1816 that the climate does not directly cause the major differences between human races. Geoffroy endorsed a theory of saltational evolution that \\"monstrosities could become the founding fathers (or mothers) of new species by instantaneous transition from one form to the next.\\"Hallgr√≠msson, Benedikt; Hall, Brian K. (2011). Variation: A Central Concept in Biology. Burlington, Massachusetts: Elsevier Academic Press. p. 18. In 1831 he speculated that birds could have arisen from reptiles by an epigenetic saltation.Hall, Brian K.; Pearson, Roy D.; M√ºller, Gerd D. (2004). Environment, Development, and Evolution: Toward a Synthesis. Vienna Series in Theoretical Biology. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Massachusetts Institute of Technology. p. 9. Geoffroy wrote that environmental pressures could produce sudden transformations to establish new species instantaneously.Bowler, Peter J. (2003). Evolution: The History of an Idea. Oakland, California: University of California Press. p. 127. In 1864 Albert von K√∂lliker revived Geoffroy's theory that evolution proceeds by large steps, under the name of heterogenesis.Wright, Sewall (1984). Evolution and the Genetics of Populations: Genetics and Biometric Foundations Volume 1. Chicago, Illinois: University of Chicago Press. p. 10 Geoffroy noted that the organization of dorsal and ventral structures in arthropods is opposite that of mammals. The inversion hypothesis was met with criticism and was rejected, however, some modern molecular embryologists have since resurrected this idea.Travis, John (1995). \\"The Ghost of Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire: Frog and Fly Genes Revive the Ridiculed Idea that Vertebrates Resemble Upside-Down Insects\\". Science News 148 (14): 216-218. Legacy The Geoffroy's cat (Leopardus geoffroyi) was named in his honour. √âtienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire is commemorated in the scientific names of two species of South American turtle, Phrynops geoffroanus and Phrynops hilarii.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

The manor house was rebuilt in the 17th century, but has a history dating back to 1066. The building overlooks the Worth Valley, facing south towards Haworth.left Nearby is Holden Park, which was the site of Oakworth House and its grounds, once owned by Sir Isaac Holden, an inventor who is said to have invented the lucifer match and revolutionised the process of carding wool. He also owned Oakworth Hall. External features thumbThe Hall is located on the corner of Providence Lane, which once ran through the Hall's farmyard. The cornerstone on the north rear wall, above the door of the farm cottage, is one of four found in the district commissioned by John Craven in July 1843.Huntsman carving at Oakworth Hall Of important historical interest is a carved stone panel of a mounted huntsman of either Celtic origins or Romano-British of the first centuries CE. Accompanying the huntsman there are three small animals which might be taken to be dogs, but in the History of Keighley they are described as \\"three goats trippant\\". A goat is featured on the coat of arms on one branch of the Copley family who were early residents of the Hall. The panel may be even earlier, perhaps pre-Roman Iron Age. Two crude heads, which are thought to be of the same period, flank the carving. The lintel above the door on the north side of the farm cottage is a curiously carved stone with triple rounded arches and double spiral decorative motifs. Both this stone and the panel came from the surrounding moors and it is believed they were incorporated into the building for good luck.alt= Internal features The main fireplace in Oakworth Hall All the original fireplaces have been preserved. There is a large inglenook fireplace, ten feet across, in the dining room. Next to the fireplace is a salt cellar. Salt was very important for the preservation of food and had to be stored in the driest place in the building. Stored in the salt cellar today is a pair of very small, leather, children's shoes which were discovered during restoration work on a chimney. Shoes were traditionally secreted away in the Middle Ages to ward off evil spirits and to bring good fortune to the residents of the Hall. Two oak beams in the dining room are 18 inches by 10 feet and actually extend throughout the Hall. The original adze marks are clearly in evidence. In the kitchen there is an old oven. It has a cast iron interior and is surrounded by large stones. It is reputed to be the oldest oven in Yorkshire that is still capable of use. From the kitchen, steps lead down to a cellar. On the first floor, two of the six bedrooms have arched gothic style windows to provide light on the landing. The windows have stone mullions. All the doors are constructed of solid English oak and the handsome front door dates from when that part of the building was rebuilt in 1702. In the study there is an original fireplace and cast iron stove. This is almost identical to the one in the later-built Bront√´ Parsonage Museum in nearby Haworth. The Hall (now numbers 69 and 71 Colne road) is a Grade II listed building and is subject to a Preservation Order. The History of the Hall *1066 - Mentioned in the Domesday Book as the Manor of Oakworth. It was given by William the Conqueror to Gilbert Tyson. *1366 - Property of the de Vaux family who were probably descendants of the Tyson family. The de Vaux families' main seat was Vauxhall (Vaux Hall, in south east London). They had large properties in northern England from South Yorkshire up to Hadrian's Wall. Thomas de Vaux was Chancellor of Richard I during the earlier Crusades to the Holy Land. *1598 - Alvery Copley, the last member of the de Vaux family, died and the 32 tenants who farmed the lands were constituted Lords of Oakworth Manor. It is believed that the first building which stood on the site was built by the de Vaux family. *1662 - The famous Baptist Minister John Moore was born at Oakworth Hall. He was a friend and close colleague of William Mitchell who was imprisoned for preaching in 1687. Together they clandestinely crisscrossed the Pennines visiting various safe houses in both Lancashire and West Yorkshire. It is thought that the previous building of Oakworth Hall was one of those \\"safe houses\\". It is advanced that the destruction of the previous building of Oakworth Hall was as a result of the turbulent period of religious persecution. It is also suggested that the old building was burned down to smoke out a \\"priest hole\\" that had existed beneath the Hall since the Reformation. *1691 - Oakworth Hall is mentioned in the Keighley Rolls in the entry for 12 December 1691. Some travellers visited the Squire, Anthony Moore, at Oakworth Hall. *1702 - The rebuilding of the Hall was probably completed by William Clough in its present form. The date 1702 is over the door on the south side of the Farm Cottage. *1708 - William Clough of Oakworth Hall is mentioned in the Haworth Court Rolls. *1715 - Jamas Haggas of Oakworth Hall bound as an apprentice to a Halifax weaver. Later, he bought long wool in Lincolnshire and sorted wool with his son at Oakworth Hall. These documents are in the deeds of the Hall. The Hall is mentioned in Heaton's Yorkshire Woollen and Worsted Industries. *1883 - Sold by the descendants of the Haggas family, (Blamire and Craven) to Richard Longdon Hattersly. *1913 - Trustees of the Hattersly family sold the Hall to Benjamin, William and John Speight who were plumbers. : (The families Clough, Haggas and Hattersly all became large textile manufacturers in the spinning and weaving industries in the West Riding of Yorkshire. The Cloughs became mohair spinners and weavers and the firm still exists today as British Mohair Spinners. Haggas became the largest worsted spinners in the area and there is still a large manufacturing plant in Keighley. The Hattersleys owned a number of worsted and woollen Mills and factories producing textile and weaving booms. There is still today Hattersley Narrow Fabrics Mill in Keighley.) *1936 - The Speight family sold the Hall to the Yorkshire Penny Bank. *1945 - When the Bank closed its Oakworth branch the Hall was bought by the Assistant Manager of the bank. It became a private residence once again. It changed hands a number of times and was a guest house from 1979‚Äì2002. *2003 - The Hall is now a private residence.

Life Born in Warsaw, Stanis≈Çaw Ignacy Witkiewicz was a son of the painter, architect and an art critic Stanis≈Çaw Witkiewicz. His mother was Maria Pietrzkiewicz Witkiewiczowa. Both of his parents were born in the Samogitian region of Lithuania. His godmother was the internationally famous actress Helena Modrzejewska. Little Witkacy with his father, ca. 1893 Witkiewicz was reared at the family home in Zakopane. In accordance with his father's antipathy to the \\"servitude of the school,\\" he was home-schooled and encouraged to develop his talents across a range of creative fields. Against his fathers wishes he studied at the Krak√≥w Academy of Fine Arts with J√≥zef Mehoffer and Jan Stanis≈Çawski. Witkiewicz was close friends with composer Karol Szymanowski and, from childhood, with Bronis≈Çaw Malinowski and Zofia Romer. Romer was romantically linked to both Bronis≈Çaw Malinowski and Witkiewicz. He had a tumultuous affair with prominent actress Irena Solska who according to Anna Mici≈Ñska is represented as the heroine Akne Montecalfi in his first novel, The 622 Downfalls of Bungo or The Demonic Woman, 1911. According to Mici≈Ñska he also represented himself as the character Bungo and Malinowski as the Duke of Nevermore. The unfinished novel, which was not published until 1972, also describes erotic encounters between Bungo and the Duke of Nevermore. Taught wet plate photography by his father, it was during this period that he also began producing the intimate portrait photography for which he is known; producing striking portraits of his circle in Zakopane and many self-portraits. In 1914 following a crisis in Witkiewicz's personal life due to the suicide of his fianc√©e Jadwiga Janczewska, for which he blamed himself, he was invited by Malinowski to act as draftsman and photographer on his anthropological expedition to the then Territory of Papua, by way of Ceylon and Australia. The venture was interrupted by the onset of World War I. After quarrelling with Malinowski in Australia, Witkiewicz who was by birth a subject of the Russian Empire, travelled to St Petersburg (then Petrograd) from Sydney and was commissioned as an officer in the Pavlovsky Regiment of the Imperial Russian Army. His ailing father, a Polish patriot, was deeply grieved by his son's decision and died in 1915 without seeing him again. In July 1916 he was seriously wounded in the battle on Stokhid River in what is now Ukraine and was evacuated to St Petersburg where he witnessed the Russian Revolution. He claimed that he worked out his philosophical principles during an artillery barrage, and that when the Revolution broke out he was elected political commissar of his regiment. His later works would show his fear of social revolution and foreign invasion, often couched in absurdist language. Stanis≈Çaw Ignacy Witkiewicz, Multiple self-portrait in mirrors, 1915‚Äì1917 He had begun to support himself through portrait painting and continued to do so on his return to Zakopane in Poland. He soon entered into a major creative phase, setting out his principles in New Forms in Painting and Introduction to the Theory of Pure Form in the Theatre. He associated with a group of \\"formist\\" artists in the early 1920s and wrote most of his plays during this period. Of about forty plays written by Witkiewicz between 1918 and 1925, twenty-one survive, and only Jan Maciej Karol Hellcat met with any public success during the author's lifetime. The original Polish manuscript of The Crazy Locomotive was also lost; the play, back-translated from two French versions, was not published until 1962. Self-portrait, 1924 After 1925, and taking the name 'Witkacy', the artist ironically re-branded his portrait painting which provided his economic sustenance as The S.I. Witkiewicz Portrait Painting Company, with the tongue in cheek motto: \\"The customer must always be satisfied\\". Several of the so-called grades of portraits were offered, from the merely representational to the more expressionistic and the narcotics-assisted. Many of his paintings were annotated with mnemonics listing the drugs taken while painting a particular painting, even if this happened to be only a cup of coffee. He also varied the spelling of his name, signing himself Witkac, Witkatze, Witkacjusz, Vitkacius and Vitecasse ‚Äî the last being French for \\"breaks quickly\\". In the late 1920s he turned to novel- writing, writing two works, Farewell to Autumn and Insatiability. The latter, his major work, encompasses geopolitics, psychoactive drugs, and philosophy. In 1935 he was awarded the Golden Laurel of the Polish Academy of Literature for his novels. During the 1930s, Witkiewicz published a text on his experiences of narcotics, including peyote, and pursued his interests in philosophy writing, Concepts and Principles Implied by the Concept of Existence 1935. He also promoted emerging writers such as Bruno Schulz. Death Shortly after Poland was invaded by Germany in September 1939, Witkiewicz escaped with his young lover Czes≈Çawa to the rural frontier town of Jeziory, in what was then eastern Poland. After hearing the news of the Soviet invasion of Poland on 17 September 1939, Witkacy committed suicide on 18 September by taking a drug overdose and trying to slit his wrists. He convinced Czes≈Çawa to attempt suicide with him by consuming Luminal, but she survived.Journal of Czes≈Çawa Okni≈Ñska, quoted in: The film Mystification 2010, written and directed by Jacek Koprowicz proposed that Witkiewicz faked his own death and lived secretly in Poland until 1968.https://cineuropa.org/en/newsdetail/138626/ Legacy Witkiewicz had died in some obscurity but his reputation began to rise soon after the war, which had destroyed his life and devastated Poland. Outside of Poland his work was discussed as a precursor to post-ww2 European drama in Martin Esslin's influential \\"Theatre of the Absurd\\" 1961, and later in Hans-Theis Lehmann's \\"Postdramatic Theatre\\" 2006. Konstanty Puzyna collected his surviving dramatic writings in two volumes in \\"Dramaty\\" (Dramas) 1962 which revived interest in his plays in Poland. Through his translations and scholarship, Daniel Gerould introduced English-language audiences to the writings of Witkiewicz. Czes≈Çaw Mi≈Çosz framed his argument in The Captive Mind around a discussion of Witkiewicz's novel, Insatiability. The artist and theater director Tadeusz Kantor was inspired by the Cricot group, through which Witkiewicz had presented his final plays in Krak√≥w. Kantor brought many of the plays back into currency, first in Poland and then internationally, including The Cuttlefish (1956) and The Water Hen (1969). Visual artist Paulina Olowska produced Witkiewicz's Mother at the Tate Modern in 2015. Films which have Witkiewicz as the subject include Tumor Witkacego 1985,and Mystification 2010 and Witkacy and Malinowski: a cinematic s√©ance in 23 scenes 2017.https://www.sff.org.au/program/browse/witkacy-malinowski-a-cinematic- seance-in-23-scenes Films based on his works include Ludiot i kalugericata 1968,Farewell to Autumn 1990, Insatiability 2003,Madame Tutli-Putli 2007 and Nursery Rhyme of a Madman 2017. Witkiewicz's paintings and pastel drawings are in the collections of the National Museum, Warsaw, the National Museum, Krak√≥w, Museum of Literature, Warsaw and the Museum of Central Pomerania with 125 works in S≈Çupsk Castle. The Metropolitan Museum of Art and Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney hold important examples of his photography. In the postwar period, Communist Poland's Ministry of Culture decided to exhume Witkiewicz's body, move it to Zakopane, and give it a solemn funeral. This was carried out according to plan, though no one was allowed to open the coffin that had been delivered by the Soviet authorities. On 26 November 1994, the Polish Ministry of Culture and Art ordered the exhumation of the presumed grave of Witkiewicz in Zakopane. Genetic tests on the remaining bones proved that the body had belonged to an unknown woman ‚Äî a final absurdist joke, fifty years after the publication of Witkacy's last novel.\\"...Przeprowadzone badania wykazujƒÖ, ≈ºe szczƒÖtki kostne, przywiezione w 1988 roku ze wsi Jeziory na Ukrainie nale≈ºƒÖ do kobiety w wieku 25‚Äì30 lat, o wzro≈õcie oko≈Ço 164 cm. ...\\" (\\"the tests conducted indicate that the bone remains, brought in 1988 from the village Jeziory in the Ukraine, belong to a woman 25‚Äì30 years old and about 164 cm tall...\\") from the protocol of the commission called by the Ministry of Culture and Art after the exhumation on 26 November 1994 of the presumed grave of Stanis≈Çaw Ignacy Witkiewicz at Pƒôksowy Brzyzek\\" cemetery in Zakopane.

The station is outside the town, in the village of Stoford. Although Yeovil is in Somerset, the station was in Dorset until 1991.http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1991/286/made It is down the line from . It was opened by the London and South Western Railway in 1860 on its London to Exeter line now known as the West of England Main Line. Today it is managed by South Western Railway and is also the home of the Yeovil Railway Centre. History Railways around Yeovil The Salisbury and Yeovil Railway (S&YR;) opened the final part of its line from on 1 June 1860. Near Bradford Abbas it crossed over the Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth line of the Great Western Railway (GWR) on a bridge, then ran alongside it and the Yeovil Branch Line of the Bristol and Exeter Railway (B&ER;) to reach that company‚Äôs terminus at , on the west side of Yeovil. Just a few weeks later, on 19 July, the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) opened its Yeovil and Exeter line. This left the S&YR; at Bradford Abbas Junction and crossed over the GWR line to its own station at Yeovil Junction, and then continued on towards Exeter Queen Street. The station was a junction because another line led back to join the S&YR; at River Junction, so trains could run from Exeter direct to Hendford (the terminus was moved to a joint B&ER;/LSWR Yeovil Town railway station from 1 June 1861). The original eastwards connection from River Junction to Bradford Abbas was closed in 1870, after which most main line trains only called at Yeovil Junction where passengers could change onto a connecting train for the short journey to Yeovil Town. The LSWR operated all trains over the S&YR; and bought the smaller company in 1878. The station at this time had two platforms serving three tracks. The northern side was the track for trains to and London Waterloo; the middle track was covered by a train shed and could be used from either platform and was for the trains to Yeovil Town; the southern track was for trains to Exeter. Goods traffic was handled on the north side of the main line, and a turntable was placed on the south side. On 13 June 1864 a new line was opened from the GWR up to a goods station at Clifton Maybank on the south side of the LSWR station. The GWR was, until 1874, a broad gauge line and broad and standard gauge wagons could be brought alongside each other at Clifton Maybank to allow goods to be transhipped between them. Yeovil Junction following reconstruction in 1908 with the station master‚Äôs house in the background. The wagons are in the Clifton Maybank sidings. Work started in 1907 to enlarge the station and was completed in 1909. The new northern platform was long with a track on either side; the northern track was for the Yeovil Town trains and the southern side was for main line services to London. The southern platform also had two tracks, the northern face for westbound trains and the opposite side was a goods siding. Two through tracks also passed between the platforms for non-stop trains. A footbridge at the west end connected the two platforms and extended over the branch track to the station forecourt. A second footbridge was erected at the east end of the station but was dismantled in 1920 and moved up the line to Overton railway station. The goods yard was also extended in 1908 and new sidings were laid near the GWR exchange siding. The cost of the work was in excess of ¬£47,000. The LSWR became a part of the Southern Railway (SR) in 1923 as a result of the Railways Act 1921. The GWR‚Äôs Clifton Maybank branch closed on 7 June 1937. Wagons would in future be exchanged at Yeovil Town, but the GWR had to build a road for Mr Paul, the owner of a private siding which had connected with their line, so that he could bring his goods to the Clifton Maybank platform instead which was still served by the SR. A new connection was established between the two companies during World War II to allow trains direct access between Yeovil Junction and on the Weymouth line. This was opened on 13 October 1943 and offered a new route for trains of war materials as well as a diversion route in the event of bomb damage. A Ruston & Hornsby shunter stands by the old goods transfer shed, now part of the Yeovil Railway Centre On 1 January 1948 the Southern Railway was nationalised to become the Southern Region of British Railways. January 1963 saw the all the lines in the area transferred to the Western Region and this was soon followed by the Reshaping of British Railways report. Yeovil Town closed to passengers on 2 October 1966, the branch service then operated to Pen Mill until it was withdrawn entirely on 4 May 1968. The main line had been rationalised on 11 June 1967 ‚Äì Yeovil was now in the middle of a single track section between Sherborne and . This soon proved a rationalisation too far and the double track was restored between Sherborne and Yeovil Junction on 1 October 1967 but all trains had to use the eastbound main line platform. On 26 March 1975 the former branch platform was reopened as a through line so that two trains could use the station at the same time.. A limited passenger service to Yeovil Pen Mill was reinstated in 2015 since when this has gradually increased in frequency. A permanent way depot was established in the old goods yard on the north side of the station in 1965. A small Ruston and Hornsby four-wheel diesel locomotive number DS1169 was kept here for shunting until 1972. In 2001 the area was used by the Somerset and Dorset Locomotive Company as a depot for its fleet of hire locomotives, although this use has now ceased. The turntable has been retained on the south side of the line and is often used for turning the locomotives of steam-hauled excursions. This and the Clifton Maybank site has been the home of the Yeovil Railway Centre since 1993. =Accidents= There have been a number of accidents at Yeovil Junction over the years, although most were minor with few injuries. * 20 September 1860 ‚Äì the rear coach of a Yeovil Junction to Hendford train derailed on the points leading onto the branch. * October 1860 ‚Äì a goods train going towards Hendford collided with a passenger train coming the other way. * 12 June 1886 ‚Äì a collision between a goods train and a passenger train to Yeovil Town due to confusing signals. * 13 July 1887 ‚Äì a locomotive collided with the coaches to which it was going to couple, knocking them almost along the track and injuring nine passengers. * 26 July 1887 ‚Äì an empty passenger carriage derailed while it was being added to a London train. * 4 July 1914 ‚Äì a coupling of an eastbound goods train broke. The rear part collided with the front from Yeovil Junction, knocking the wooden upper storey off the West signal box. * 20 August 1918 ‚Äì a collision between locomotives occurred due to the signalman not following rules. =Signalling= Inside the signal box The first signal boxes were built in 1875. \\"Yeovil Junction No. 1\\" was on the north side of the line at the west of the station, and \\"Yeovil Junction No. 2\\" was at the opposite end. When the station was rebuilt in 1908 the No. 1 Box was replaced by a new 60-lever \\"Yeovil Junction East\\" situated between the main and branch lines; No. 2 box was extended and renamed \\"Yeovil Junction West\\". The latter was damaged in an accident on 20 August 1918 but was rebuilt. At the end of 1949 they were renamed again, the East Box becoming \\"Yeovil Junction A\\" and the West Box \\"Yeovil Junction B\\" The 1967 rationalisation saw the closure of the B Box on 30 April but the A Box was retained to control movements on the branch to Yeovil Town and Pen Mill. A siding connection to the main line was controlled by \\"Yeovil Junction West Ground Frame\\", while \\"Yeovil Junction East Ground Frame\\" was used for a connection to the sidings on the south side of the main line. When the double track was reinstated to Sherborne the signal box frame was replaced with a Western Region one of 44 levers. The remaining box was closed in March 2012, when the line between Saisbury and Exmouth Junction was re- signalled.\\"Salisbury to Exeter re-signalling scheme\\" Yeovil Railway Centre; Retrieved 29 September 2016 Signalling here is now supervised from Basingstoke Rail Operations Centre. Description The view eastwards from the platform. The entrance to the station is across the footbridge from the car park on the north side of the line. The garage in the middle of the car park is the station‚Äôs original goods shed, and the remaining goods sidings are at the end of the car park. Descending from the footbridge to the platform brings passengers to the main station offices, which are built from red bricks with red glazed abutments. A second similar building at the east end of the platform is the station buffet which still contains its original (1908) counter. Now known as \\"Peppers\\", in 2009 it appeared in a list of \\"highly commended\\" station cafes published in The Guardian but came under new management in 2011. Tracks serve both sides of the platform and are each signalled for trains to run in either direction. Beyond the east end of the platform was the signal box, now demolished. The tracks to London are on its right, and the single track to Yeovil Pen Mill is on its left. No regular passenger services operated over this route from 1968 until December 2015 when a limited service was introduced between London Waterloo and Yeovil Pen Mill via Yeovil Junction. Opposite the main platform the old eastbound through line has been lifted but the westbound line is retained as a siding, accessible only from the east end of the station. Beyond is the old westbound platform which is no longer connected to the main station but is used by occasional visiting steam trains and by the Yeovil Railway Centre which lies to the south. The turntable is at the right of their railway centre. It makes use of tracks to the left which are on the site of the old GWR Clifton Maybank goods depot. At the far end is a raised earthwork that looks like it once carried another siding, but it is in fact part of the original scheme of 1864 which envisaged another link from Clifton Maybank southwards towards which was never completed. Services A South Western Railway arriving from London Waterloo South Western Railway operate services at least once per hour during the daytime to London Waterloo and . A limited service operates to , some of which then continue to London Waterloo via . There is also a service running on summer Saturdays between and London Waterloo via Yeovil Pen Mill and Yeovil Junction for the first time in 2016. There are bus services to Yeovil and the nearby village of Barwick, these are provided by South West Coaches service 68. Connection by bus to Yeovil Pen Mill is accessible via a change at Yeovil Bus Station (using South West Coaches Services 68 & 70). This runs roughly 0700 to 1810 Monday to Saturday (except Public Holidays).

Portrait by Jacek Malczewski, 1897. Stanis≈Çaw Witkiewicz () (8 May 1851 - 5 September 1915) was a Polish painter, art theoretician, and amateur architect, known for his creation of \\"Zakopane Style\\". Life Witkiewicz was born in Pa≈°iau≈°ƒó () in Samogitia, present-day Lithuania, in the lands of the partitioned Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, ruled at the time by the Russian Empire. As an adolescent, he spent several years in Siberian Tomsk, where his parents and two older siblings were exiled for their support of the January Uprising. He studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Saint Petersburg (1868‚Äì1871) and furthered his studies in Munich (1872‚Äì1875). During his stay in Munich, he befriended painters Aleksander Gierymski, J√≥zef Che≈Çmo≈Ñski and Henryk Siemiradzki. In 1875, he moved to Warsaw and set up a painting workshop in the laundry at the Hotel Europejski. In 1884, he married Maria Pietrzkiewicz. The pair had a son, Stanis≈Çaw Ignacy. The son's godmother was the internationally famous actress Helena Modjeska, whom the elder Witkiewicz in 1876 had nearly accompanied to California in the United States. In 1884‚Äì1887, Witkiewicz worked as the artistic director of \\"Wƒôdrowiec\\" weekly, for which he wrote a series of articles concerning the values of a work of art and the role of art critics (published in book form under the title \\"Painting and criticism among us\\", Sztuka i krytyka u nas, in 1891 and 1899). In 1887, he held the same position in \\"K≈Çosy\\" magazine. Villa Konstantyn√≥wka in Zakopane. Joseph Conrad stayed there in 1914 In 1886, he visited Zakopane for the first time. He developed a fascination with the mountains, the Podhale highlanders and their vernacular traditions. His ambition became to create a Polish national style through extraction of all- Polish forms from the architectural and decorative art of the highlanders. He formulated the Zakopane Style (styl zakopia≈Ñski) (also known as Witkiewicz Style (styl witkiewiczowski)) in architecture,See picture in Polish article on styl zakopia≈Ñski in which he designed homes and interiors for well-off, artistically inclined Poles. He was strongly associated with Zakopane and promoted it in the art community. Witkiewicz had strong views against formal education: \\"school is completely at odds with the psychological make-up of human beings\\". He applied this principle in his son's upbringing and was disappointed when the 20-year-old Witkacy chose to enroll at the Academy of Fine Arts in Krak√≥w. In 1908, suffering from tuberculosis, the elder Witkiewicz left his family in Zakopane and relocated to Lovran, a fashionable resort in what was then Austria-Hungary, which today is in Croatia. He died there in 1915. His first monographic art exhibition was staged in Zachƒôta Fine Arts Society in 1927.

He is most acclaimed as a master of Neo-Impressionism and he played an important role in shaping the second phase of that movement. He was a significant influence on Henri Matisse and many other artists. His work was instrumental in the development of Fauvism. Background and education Henri-Edmond-Joseph Delacroix was born in Douai, a commune in the Nord d√©partment in northern France, on 20May 1856. He had no surviving siblings. His parents, with a family history of ironmongery, were Alcide Delacroix, a French adventurer, and British Fanny Woollett. In 1865 the family moved to a location near Lille, a northern French city close to the Belgian border. Alcide's cousin, Dr.Auguste Soins, recognized Henri's artistic talent and was very supportive of his artistic inclinations, even financing the boy's first drawing instructions under painter Carolus-Duran the following year. Henri was Duran's prot√©g√© for a year. His studies continued for a short time in Paris in 1875 with Fran√ßois Bonvin before returning to Lille. He studied at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, and in 1878 he enrolled at the √âcoles Acad√©miques de Dessin et d'Architecture, studying for three years in the studio of Alphonse Colas. His art education continued, under fellow Douai artist √âmile Dupont-Zipcy, after moving to Paris in 1881. Early work Madame Hector France, 1891, Mus√©e d'Orsay Cross's early works, portraits and still lifes, were in the dark colors of Realism. In order to distinguish himself from the famous Romantic painter Eug√®ne Delacroix, he changed his name in 1881, shortening and Anglicizing his birth name to \\"Henri Cross\\" ‚Äì the French word croix means cross. 1881 was also the year of his first exhibition at the Salon des Artistes Fran√ßais. He painted many landscapes on an 1883 trip to the Alpes-Maritimes, accompanied by his family. Dr.Soins, who was also along on the trip, was the subject of a painting that Cross exhibited at Nice's Exposition Universelle later in the year. During the Mediterranean trip, Cross met Paul Signac, who became a close friend and artistic influence. In 1884 Cross co-founded the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Ind√©pendants, which consisted of artists displeased with the practices of the official Salon, and presented unjuried exhibitions without prizes. There, he met and became friends with many artists involved in the Neo-Impressionist movement, including Georges Seurat, Albert Dubois-Pillet, and Charles Angrand. Despite his association with the Neo-Impressionists, Cross did not adopt their style for many years. His work continued to manifest influences such as Jules Bastien-Lepage and √âdouard Manet, as well as the Impressionists. The change from his early, somber, Realist work was gradual. His color palette became lighter, working in the brighter colors of Impressionism. He also worked en plein air. In the latter part of the 1880s, he painted pure landscapes that showed the influence of Claude Monet and Camille Pissarro. In about 1886, again attempting to differentiate himself from another French artist ‚Äì this time, Henri Cros ‚Äì he again changed his name, finally adopting \\"Henri-Edmond Cross\\". The farm, evening, 1893, private collection In 1891 Cross began painting in the Neo-Impressionist style, and exhibited his first large piece using this technique in an Ind√©pendants show. That painting was a divisionist portrait of Madame Hector France, n√©e Irma Clare, whom Cross had met in 1888 and would marry in 1893. Robert Rosenblum wrote that \\"the picture is softly charged with a granular, atmospheric glow\\". Cross had wintered in the south of France from 1883 onward, until, suffering from rheumatism, he finally moved there full-time in 1891. His works were still exhibited in Paris. His first residence in southern France was in Cabasson, near Le Lavandou, then he settled a short distance away, in the small hamlet of Saint-Clair, where he spent the remainder of his life, leaving only for trips to Italy in 1903 and 1908, and for his annual Ind√©pendants exhibits in Paris. In 1892 Cross's friend Paul Signac moved to nearby Saint-Tropez, where they frequently hosted gatherings in Cross's garden, attended by such luminaries as Henri Matisse, Andr√© Derain, and Albert Marquet. L'air du soir, c.1893, Mus√©e d'Orsay Cross's affinity with the Neo-Impressionist movement extended beyond the painting style to include their political philosophies. Like Signac, Pissarro, and other Neo-Impressionists, Cross believed in anarchist principles, with hope for a utopian society. In 1896 Cross created a lithograph, L'Errant (The Wanderer). This marked the first time he had worked with a publisher, and the piece was featured anonymously in Les Temps Nouveaux, Jean Grave's anarchist journal. Cross's anarchist sentiments influenced his choice of subjects: he painted scenes illustrating a utopian world that could exist through anarchism. The process of creating Divisionist paintings with numerous small dots of color was tedious and time-consuming. When Cross wanted to depict quick impressions, he created watercolor or colored pencil images in his sketchbooks. He wrote of a rustic French outing: Later years La Plage de Saint-Clair, 1896 Cross's paintings of the early- to mid-1890s are characteristically Pointillist, with closely and regularly positioned tiny dots of color. Beginning around 1895, he gradually shifted his technique, instead using broad, blocky brushstrokes and leaving small areas of exposed bare canvas between the strokes. The resulting surfaces resembled mosaics, and the paintings may be seen as precursors to Fauvism and Cubism. In the Pointillist style, minute spots of paint were used to blend colors harmoniously; in contrast, the strategy in \\"second generation Neo- Impressionism\\" was to keep the colors separate, resulting in \\"vibrant shimmering visual effects through contrast\\". Cross stated that the Neo- Impressionists were \\"far more interested in creating harmonies of pure color, than in harmonizing the colors of a particular landscape or natural scene\\". Matisse and other artists were very influenced by the late-career Cross, and such works were instrumental in forming the principles of Fauvism. Among the other artists influenced by Cross were Andr√© Derain, Henri Manguin, Charles Camoin, Albert Marquet, Jean Puy, and Louis Valtat. La fuite des nymphes, c.1906, Mus√©e d'Orsay Une clairi√®re en Provence (√âtude), c.1906 In 1905 Galerie Druet in Paris mounted Cross's first solo exhibition, which featured thirty paintings and thirty watercolors. The show was very successful, receiving critical acclaim, and most of the works were sold. Belgian Symbolist poet Emile Verhaeren, an avid supporter of Neo-Impressionism in his country, provided the preface for the exhibition catalog, writing: Cypresses at Cagnes, 1908, Mus√©e d'Orsay In the early 1880s Cross began to experience trouble with his eyes, which grew more severe in the 1900s. He also increasingly suffered from arthritis. At least in part due to these health issues that plagued him for years, Cross's body of work is relatively small. However, in his last years he was productive and very creative, and his work was featured in significant solo exhibitions; he received great acclaim from critics and enjoyed commercial success. In 1909 Cross was treated in a Paris hospital for cancer. In January 1910 he returned to Saint-Clair, where he died of the cancer just four days short of his 54th birthday, on 16May 1910. His tomb, in the Le Lavandou cemetery, features a bronze medallion that his friend Th√©o van Rysselberghe had designed. In July 1911, the city of Cross's birth, Douai, mounted a retrospective exhibition of his work. Selected exhibitions Regatta in Venice, 1898/1908 In addition to the exhibitions mentioned above, Cross participated in many others. Octave Maus invited him to exhibit his work in several of the Annual Exhibitions of LesXX. Cross participated in the Libre Esth√©tique show of 1895 at Maus's invitation, and also in those of 1897, 1901, 1904, 1908, and 1909. In 1898 he participated with Paul Signac, Maximilien Luce, and Th√©o van Rysselberghe in the first Neo-Impressionist exhibition in Germany, organized by Harry Kessler at Keller und Reiner Gallery (Berlin). In 1907 F√©lix F√©n√©on assembled a Cross retrospective in Paris at Galerie Bernheim-Jeune, with Maurice Denis contributing the catalogue preface. Other venues with Cross exhibitions included Samuel Bing's L'Art Nouveau √† Paris, Galerie Durand-Ruel (Paris), Cassirer Gallery (Hamburg, Berlin), Toison d'or exhibition (Moscow), Bernheim-Jeune's Aquarelle et pastel, and various others, including galleries in Paris, Dresden, Weimar, and Munich.

The first crude magnetic recorder was invented in 1898 by Valdemar Poulsen. The first magnetic recorder to be made commercially available anywhere was the Telegraphone, manufactured by the American Telegraphone Company, Springfield, Massachusetts. The wire is pulled rapidly across a recording head which magnetizes each point along the wire in accordance with the intensity and polarity of the electrical audio signal being supplied to the recording head at that instant. By later drawing the wire across the same or a similar head while the head is not being supplied with an electrical signal, the varying magnetic field presented by the passing wire induces a similarly varying electric current in the head, recreating the original signal at a reduced level. Magnetic wire recording was replaced by magnetic tape recording by the 1950s, but devices employing one or the other of these media had been more or less simultaneously under development for many years before either came into widespread use. The principles and electronics involved are nearly identical.  History  First US patent issued 1900 for a magnetic recorder by inventor Valdemar Poulsen The first wire recorder was invented in 1898 by Danish engineer Valdemar Poulsen, who gave his product the trade name Telegraphone. Wire recorders for dictation and telephone recording were made almost continuously by multiple companies (mainly the American Telegraphone Company) through the 1920s and 1930s, but use of this new technology was extremely limited. Dictaphone and Ediphone recorders, which still employed wax cylinders as the recording medium, were the devices normally used for these applications during this period. The peak of wire recording lasted from approximately 1946 to 1954. It resulted from technical improvements and the development of inexpensive designs licensed internationally by the Brush Development Company of Cleveland, Ohio and the Armour Research FoundationMorton (1998) (journal article), p. 213. of the Armour Institute of Technology (later the IIT Research Institute of the Illinois Institute of Technology). The two organizations (Brush and Armour) licensed dozens of manufacturers in the U.S., Japan, and Europe. Examples are Wilcox-Gay, Pierce, Webcor, and Air King. Sales elsewhere encouraged Sears to provide a model,Sears (circa 1949) (pamphlet manual). and some authors to prepare specialized manuals.Sams (1947) (book).Hickman (1958) (book).Judge (1950) (manual). These improved wire recorders were not only marketed for office use, but also as home entertainment devices that offered advantages over the home disc recorders which were increasingly sold for making short recordings of family and friends and for recording excerpts from radio broadcasts. Unlike home-cut phonograph records, the steel wire could be reused for new recordings and allowed much longer uninterrupted recordings to be made than the few minutes of audio per side possible with disc recorders. The earliest magnetic tape recorders, not commercially available in the United States until 1948, were too expensive, complicated, and bulky to compete with these consumer- level wire recorders.Morton (1998) (journal article). During the first half of the 1950s, however, tape recorders which were sufficiently affordable, simple, and compact to be suitable for home and office use started appearing and they rapidly superseded wire recorders in the marketplace. Exceptionally, the use of wire for sound recording continued into the 1960s in Protona's Minifon miniature recorders, in which the importance of maximizing recording time in a minimum of space outweighed other considerations. For any given level of audio quality, the nearly hair-thin wire had the advantage that it was a much more compact storage medium than tape. The Minifon wire recorder was designed for stealth use and its accessories included a microphone disguised as a wristwatch.Protona Minifon Special, cryptomuseum.com, Retrieved 2016-01-06. Wire recording was also used in some aircraft flight recorders beginning in the early 1940s, mainly for recording radio conversations between crewmen or with ground stations. Because steel wire was more compact, robust, and heat- resistant than magnetic tape (which is plastic-based), wire recorders continued to be manufactured for this purpose through the 1950s and remained in use somewhat later than that. There were also wire recorders made to record data in satellites and other unmanned spacecraft of the 1950s to perhaps the 1970s.  Characteristics  = Magnetic format = German Reichhalter Reporter W102 wire recorder (c. 1950) Poulsen's original telegraphone and other very early recorders placed the two poles of the record/replay head on opposite sides of the wire. The wire is thus magnetised transversely to the direction of travel. This method of magnetization was quickly found to have the limitation that as the wire twisted during playback, there were times when the magnetization of the wire was at right angles to the position of the two poles of the head and the output from the head fell to almost zero. The recorder was improved by placing the two poles on the same side of the wire so that the wire was magnetised along its length or longitudinally. Additionally, the poles were shaped into a \\"V\\" so that the head wrapped around the wire to some extent. This increased the magnetising effect and also increased the sensitivity of the head on replay because it collected more of the magnetic flux from the wire. This system was not entirely immune to twisting but the effects were far less marked. = Media capacity and speed = Compared to tape recorders, wire recording devices have a high media speed, made necessary because of the use of the solid metal medium. Standard postwar wire recorders use a nominal speed of 24 inches per second (610 mm/s), making a typical one- hour spool of wire 7,200 feet (approx. 2200 m) long. This enormous length is possible on a spool less than in diameter because the wire was very fine, having a diameter of for later models, an improvement over Poulsen's Telegraphone of 1898 which used wire. Transcribed and hosted online by the Audio Engineering Society. Smaller 30- and 15-minute lengths of wire were employed by the majority of recorders made after 1945. Some heavy-duty recorders use the larger Armour spools, which can contain enough wire to record continuously for several hours. Because the wire is pulled past the head by the take-up spool, the actual wire speed slowly increases as the effective diameter of the take-up spool increases. Standardization prevented this peculiarity from having any impact on the playback of a spool recorded on a different machine, but audible consequences can result from substantially altering the original length of a recorded wire by excisions or by dividing it up onto multiple spools. = Fidelity = The audio fidelity of a wire recording made on one of these post-1945 machines is comparable to a contemporary phonograph record or one of the early tape recorders, given a microphone or other signal source of equal quality. Because of its homogeneous nature and very high speed, wire is relatively free of the noticeable background hiss which characterized tape recordings before the advent of noise reduction systems. The Magnecord Corp. of Chicago briefly manufactured a high- fidelity wire recorder intended for studio use, but soon abandoned the system to concentrate on tape recorders.  Handling and editing  To facilitate handling as the user threaded the wire across the recording head and affixed it to the take-up spool, some manufacturers attached a strip of plastic to each end of the wire. This was designed to press-fit snugly into either spool. To prevent the wire from piling up unevenly on the spool as it was recorded, played or rewound, on the majority of machines the head assembly slowly oscillates up and down or back and forth to distribute the wire evenly. On some machines, moving wire guides perform this function, like the mechanism that distributes line across a fishing reel. After recording or playback, the wire has to be rewound before any further use can be made of the machine. Unlike with reel-to-reel tape recorders, the take-up reel on most wire recorders is not removable. A break in the wire is repaired by tying the ends together and trimming. When such a repair is made to an existing recording, a jump in the sound results during playback, but because of the high speed of the wire the loss of an inch due to tying and trimming is trivial and might pass unnoticed. Unfortunately, if the wire breaks it can easily become tangled, and snarls are extremely difficult to fix. Sometimes the only practical solution is to carefully cut the tangled portion away from the spool‚Äîan operation which runs the risk of endlessly enlarging the problem‚Äîand discard it. The difficulty of handling the wire itself when necessary is arguably the only serious shortcoming, among several definite advantages, of steel wire as a monophonic recording medium. Editing is accomplished by cutting and splicing. As the knot of each splice passes through the head during playback, a very brief loss of normal contact is inevitable and the resulting dropouts can make editing musical recordings problematic. Although wire is not as suitable for editing as magnetic tape (a plastic-based material) would prove to be, in the field of radio broadcasting it offered tremendous advantages over trying to edit material recorded on transcription discs, which was usually accomplished by dubbing to a new transcription disc with the aid of multiple turntables and stopwatches. The first regularly scheduled network radio program produced and edited on wire was CBS' Hear It Now with Edward R. Murrow.  Notable uses  SEAC magnetic wire drives and cartridges In 1944‚Äì1945, the 3132 Signal Service Company Special of the U.S. Army's top secret Ghost Army used wire recorders to create sonic deception on the Western Front in the Second World War. Multiple battlefield scenarios were recreated using military sounds recorded at Fort Knox, Kentucky. The wire- recorded audio, which was played back through powerful amplifiers and speakers mounted on vehicles, was used to conceal real Allied deployments, locations and operations.The Washington Post (newspaper), 2006 July 08. In 1944 at the Middle East Radio Station of Cairo, Egyptian composer Halim El-Dabh used wire recorders as a tool to compose music.Gluck, Bob. Conversation with Halim El- Dabh, EMF Institute During the Nuremberg trials (1945‚Äì1946) simultaneous wire recordings were made for English, German and other languages spoken during proceedings. In 1946 David Boder, a professor of psychology at Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, traveled to Europe to record long interviews with \\"displaced persons\\"‚Äîmost of them Holocaust survivors. Using an early wire recorder from the Armour Research Foundation, Boder came back with the first recorded Holocaust testimonials and in all likelihood the first recorded oral histories of significant length.Marziali, Carl (2001-10-26). \\"Mr. Boder Vanishes\\". This American Life. In 1946, Norman Corwin and his technical assistant, Lee Bland, took a wire recorder on their One World Flight, a round-the-world trip subsidized by friends of Wendell Willkie and patterned after Willkie's own 1942 trip. Corwin documented the post-war world and used his recordings in a series of 13 broadcast documentaries on CBS‚Äîwhich were also among the first broadcast uses of recorded sound allowed by the radio networks.Bannerman (1986) (book).Ehrlich (2006) (journal article). In 1947, Maya Deren, an American experimental filmmaker, purchased a wire recorder from her Guggenheim Fellowship funds to record Haitian Vodou ceremonies for her documentary: Meditation on Violence.

Bridge: Boston University community's weekly newspaper In 1949 at Fuld Hall in Rutgers University, Paul Braverman made a 75-minute recording of a Woody Guthrie concert using a wire recorder. The recording only came to light in 2001, and appears to be the only surviving live recording of Woody Guthrie; it was restored over several years and released on CD in 2007. The CD, The Live Wire: Woody Guthrie in Performance 1949, subsequently won the 2008 Grammy Award for Best Historical Album.THE LIVE WIRE: WOODY GUTHRIE IN PERFORMANCE 1949 has WON the 2008 GRAMMY for Best Historical Album, Woody Guthrie Foundation news release, 2008-02-10. One of the world's first stored-program computers, SEAC, built in 1950 at the U.S. National Bureau of Standards, used wire recorders to store digital data. In 1952, the Harvard University physics department's musical variety show The Physical Revue, written by Tom Lehrer and performed by a cast including Lehrer, Lewis M. Branscomb and others, was recorded on wire by a later winner of the Nobel Prize, Norman Foster Ramsey Jr. This recording was recently rediscovered and made available online.https://ww3.haverford.edu/physics/songs/lehrer/physrev.htm Wire recorders sometimes appear in motion pictures made during the time of their widest use. For example, in office scenes in the original 1951 version of The Thing, a typical Webster-Chicago unit is plainly visible on a small table by the window. In some shots (e.g., at 0:11:40 on the 2003 DVD release), its detached lid, carrying two extra spools of wire, is also visible. In this instance the recorder is simply \\"set dressing\\" and is not shown in operation. The 1958 spy thriller Spy in the Sky! uses a wire recording as a plot device. In the episode \\"The Relaxed Informer\\" (S1E24) of Danger Man the spy courier is smuggling a recording made on wire secreted inside the handle holding a puppet's strings. The recording wire is later shown being played in an office using a wire player. In episode 2.18 of Adventures of Superman, \\"Semi-Private Eye\\", PI Homer Garrity has a wire recorder he uses to surreptitiously record his clients. The fictional Allied officers of Hogan's Heroes used a wire recorder to record a meeting in Kommandant Klink's office on a device that was disguised as a sewing box made of wooden thread spools. A wire recording was the subject of a 1966 Mission Impossible episode titled \\"A Spool There Was\\". The Department S episode \\"A Cellar Full of Silence\\" revolves around a blackmail recording on a wire disguised as part of another object. A wire recorder is also used as a plot device in Arthur Miller's 1949 play, Death of a Salesman. Similarly, in the 1990 film Dick Tracy, set in the 1930s, Warren Beatty, in the title role, is shown manipulating a wire on which the voice of \\"Mumbles\\" (played by Dustin Hoffman) is recorded, in order to decipher the otherwise unintelligible speech of the fictitious criminal. In the 1990 film The Two Jakes, set in 1948, the plot centers around a wire recording made in a divorce-case-turned-homicide.

Bretzke is a papal encyclical promulgated by Pope Pius XI on 31 December 1930 in response to the Lambeth Conference of the Anglican Communion. It stressed the sanctity of marriage, prohibited Catholics from using any form of artificial birth control, and reaffirmed the prohibition on abortion. It also explained the authority of church doctrine on moral matters, and advocated that civil governments follow the lead of the church in this area. Topics Casti connubii was a response to the Lambeth Conference of 1930 in which the Anglican Communion approved the use of birth control in limited circumstances. It covered four major topics: the sanctity of marriage, opposition to eugenics, positions on birth control and the purpose of sexuality, and reaffirmation of the prohibition on abortion. =Sanctity of marriage= Pope Pius XI's encyclical references and confirms Arcanum (1880) on Christian marriage by Pope Leo XIII.Pope Pius XI, Casti connubii, ¬ß4 Vatican, 31 December 1930 Catholic doctrine has always considered matrimony to be a most holy state of life for those called to the married life (Thomas Aquinas Summa Theologica; Augustine of Hippo On the Goods of Marriage). This encyclical reaffirms that marriage is a sacrament, and a means to sanctifying grace.Hull, Michael. \\"Marriage and Family in Casti Connubii and Humanae Vitae\\", Homeletics and Pastoral Review, November 2004 The encyclical also affirms the church's opposition to adultery and divorce, and its support of wives as homemakers. It calls for wives to be obedient to their husbands, while commanding husbands to love their wives as \\"Christ loved His Church\\". > This ... does not deny or take away the liberty which fully belongs to the > woman both in view of her dignity as a human person, and in view of her most > noble office as wife and mother and companion; nor does it bid her obey her > husband's every request if not in harmony with right reason or with the > dignity due to wife; ... For if the man is the head, the woman is the heart, > and as he occupies the chief place in ruling, so she may and ought to claim > for herself the chief place in love.Pope Pius XI, Casti connubii, ¬ß27, 31 > December 1930, Vatican =Opposition to eugenics= Casti connubii speaks out against the eugenics laws, then popular, that forbade those deemed 'unfit' from marrying and having children: \\"Those who act in this way are at fault in losing sight of the fact that the family is more sacred than the State and that men are begotten not for the earth and for time, but for Heaven and eternity.\\" It also took a strong stand against forced sterilizations. Pius XI stated that if no crime has taken place and there is no cause present for grave punishment, magistrates have no direct power over the bodies of their subjects. He cited Thomas Aquinas: > St. Thomas teaches this when inquiring whether human judges for the sake of > preventing future evils can inflict punishment, he admits that the power > indeed exists as regards certain other forms of evil, but justly and > properly denies it as regards the maiming of the body. =Birth control and the purpose of sexuality= Prior to this encyclical, it was believed by some Catholics that the only licit reason for sexual intercourse was an attempt to create children. At the time, there was no official church position on any non-procreative purposes of intercourse. Casti connubii does repeat several times that the conjugal act is intrinsically tied with procreation: However, Casti connubii also acknowledges the unitive aspect of intercourse as licit: Casti connubii also reaffirms the dignity of the human conjugal act as distinct from the conjugal acts of animals, by its volitive nature; that is, the act is not merely biological but rooted in the will and therefore a personal act. The 'natural reasons of time or of certain defects' are universally accepted as meaning menopause and infertility. This paragraph thus means menopausal and infertile couples may morally engage in intercourse, even though there is no possibility of children resulting from the act, as long as it is done for serious reasons, and not merely as a contraceptive. The 'natural reasons of time' is interpreted by some to also mean the infertile portion of a woman's menstrual cycle. The practice of avoiding pregnancy by abstaining from sexual relations when the woman is fertile (natural family planning) was first addressed in rulings by the Sacred Penitentiary in 1853 and 1880, which declared the practice moral. However, a few Catholic theologians continued to hold that such practices were equivalent to contraception and thus immoral, and some historians consider two 1951 speeches by Pope Pius XIIMoral Questions Affecting Married Life: Addresses given October 29, 1951 to the Italian Catholic Union of midwives and November 26, 1951 to the National Congress of the Family Front and the Association of Large Families, National Catholic Welfare Conference, Washington, DC. to be the first explicit church acceptance of natural family planning. The church's view of contraception was explored further in the 1968 encyclical Humanae vitae by Pope Paul VI, and by Pope John Paul II's lecture series later entitled Theology of the Body. =Abortion= This encyclical repeats the church's condemnation of abortion in all circumstances. It also draws a connection between contracepting couples and couples that have abortions: \\"... those wicked parents who seek to remain childless, and failing in this, are not ashamed to put their offspring to death.\\" Reactions and impact In a 1932 article published in The Nation, Margaret Sanger gave her personal reaction to the encyclical, saying that it was an obstacle to general approval of the birth-control movement by political leaders unwilling to oppose the leadership of the church. She also asserts that it is \\"not in accord with science and definitely against social welfare and race improvement\\".The Pope's Position on Birth Control Casti connubii is most noted for its anti-contraception position. Unlike major Protestant denominations, the Catholic Church has continued its opposition to artificial birth control. This encyclical, along with Humanae vitae, has come to represent that stance.

This is an equivalence relation, whose equivalence classes are generally called jets. The point of osculation is also called the double cusp. Contact is a geometric notion; it can be defined algebraically as a valuation. One speaks also of curves and geometric objects having k-th order contact at a point: this is also called osculation (i.e. kissing), generalising the property of being tangent. (Here the derivatives are considered with respect to arc length.) An osculating curve from a given family of curves is a curve that has the highest possible order of contact with a given curve at a given point; for instance a tangent line is an osculating curve from the family of lines, and has first-order contact with the given curve; an osculating circle is an osculating curve from the family of circles, and has second-order contact (same tangent angle and curvature), etc..  Applications  Contact forms are particular differential forms of degree 1 on odd-dimensional manifolds; see contact geometry. Contact transformations are related changes of coordinates, of importance in classical mechanics. See also Legendre transformation. Contact between manifolds is often studied in singularity theory, where the type of contact are classified, these include the A series (A0: crossing, A1: tangent, A2: osculating, ...) and the umbilic or D-series where there is a high degree of contact with the sphere. Contact between curves Two curves in the plane intersecting at a point p are said to have: *0th-order contact if the curves have a simple crossing (not tangent). *1st-order contact if the two curves are tangent. *2nd-order contact if the curvatures of the curves are equal. Such curves are said to be osculating. *3rd-order contact if the derivatives of the curvature are equal. *4th-order contact if the second derivatives of the curvature are equal. =Contact between a curve and a circle= A circle with 1st-order contact (tangent) A circle with 2nd-order contact (osculating) A circle with 3rd-order contact at a vertex of a curve For each point S(t) on a smooth plane curve S, there is exactly one osculating circle, whose radius is the reciprocal of Œ∫(t), the curvature of S at t. Where curvature is zero (at an inflection point on the curve), the osculating circle is a straight line. The locus of the centers of all the osculating circles (also called \\"centers of curvature\\") is the evolute of the curve. If the derivative of curvature Œ∫'(t) is zero, then the osculating circle will have 3rd-order contact and the curve is said to have a vertex. The evolute will have a cusp at the center of the circle. The sign of the second derivative of curvature determines whether the curve has a local minimum or maximum of curvature. All closed curves will have at least four vertices, two minima and two maxima (the four-vertex theorem). In general a curve will not have 4th-order contact with any circle. However, 4th-order contact can occur generically in a 1-parameter family of curves, at a curve in the family where (as the parameter varies) two vertices (one maximum and one minimum) come together and annihilate. At such points the second derivative of curvature will be zero. =Bi-tangents in econometrics= In econometrics it is also possible to consider circles which have two point contact with two points S(t1), S(t2) on the curve. Such circles are bi-tangent circles. The centers of all bi-tangent circles form the symmetry set. The medial axis is a subset of the symmetry set. These sets have been used as a method of characterising the shapes of biological objects by Mario Henrique Simonsen, Brazilian and English econometrist. References Ian R.

He is the longest serving current member of the Privy Council of Canada, just ahead of Prince Philip. Early life Hellyer was born and raised on a farm near Waterford, Ontario. Upon completion of high school, he studied aeronautical engineering at the Curtiss-Wright Technical Institute of Aeronautics in Glendale, California, graduating in 1941. While studying, he also obtained a private pilot's licence. After graduation, Hellyer was employed at Fleet Aircraft in Fort Erie, Ontario, which was then making training craft for the Royal Canadian Air Force as part of Canada's war effort in World War II. He attempted to become an RCAF pilot himself, but was told no more pilots were necessary, after which he joined the Royal Canadian Artillery and served as a gunner for the duration of the war. Hellyer earned a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Toronto in 1949. Early political career Hellyer in the 1940s (age early 20s) First elected as a Liberal in 1949 federal election in the riding of Davenport, he was the youngest person ever elected to that point in the House of Commons of Canada. He served a brief stint as Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of National Defence. He was then named Associate Minister of National Defence in the cabinet of Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent. This post was short-lived, though, as Hellyer lost his seat when the St. Laurent government lost the 1957 election two months later. Hellyer returned to parliament in a 1958 by-election in the neighbouring riding of Trinity, and became an effective opposition critic of John Diefenbaker's Progressive Conservative government. Cabinet minister and Liberal leadership candidate When the Liberals returned to power in the 1963 election, Hellyer became Minister of National Defence in the cabinet of Lester B. Pearson. This was the most significant period in Hellyer's political career. As Minister of Defence, he oversaw the drastic and controversial integration and unification of the Royal Canadian Navy, Canadian Army, and the Royal Canadian Air Force into a single organization, the Canadian Forces. Hellyer contested the 1968 Liberal leadership election, placing second on the first ballot, but slipped to third on the second and third ballots, and withdrew to support Robert Winters on the fourth ballot, in which Pierre Trudeau won the leadership. He served as Trudeau's Transport Minister. Politics 1969‚Äì1988 In 1969, Hellyer issued a major report on housing and urban renewal in which he advocated incremental reforms rather than new government programs. He called for greater flexibility in Canada's mortgage loan system, and encouraged corporate pension funds to invest more money in housing programs.Winnipeg Free Press, 25 January 1969, p. 11. His approach did not meet with universal acceptance. Some provincial and municipal governments were openly skeptical,Winnipeg Free Press, 30 January 1969, p. 6. It was noted that Toronto councillor David Rotenberg was a supporter of Hellyer's proposals. and Heward Grafftey, a left-leaning Progressive Conservative with an interest in housing, called for a more radical approach. Hellyer's report also called for the suspension of the \\"wholesale destruction of older housing\\" and for \\"greater selectivity... in the demolition of existing houses\\". Grand urban renewal projects would come to an end as a result of his Task Force. Hellyer resigned from the cabinet in 1969 over a dispute with Trudeau over the implementation of the housing program. Hellyer sat in Parliament as an independent beginning in 1971. After his 1971 attempt to form a new political party, Action Canada, failed, Progressive Conservative leader Robert Stanfield invited him to join the PC caucus. He returned to prominence as an opposition critic and was re-elected in the 1972 election as a Progressive Conservative. He lost his seat, however, in the 1974 election. Despite this loss, Hellyer contested the PC leadership election of 1976. His views were too right wing for most delegates, and alienated many Tories with a speech attacking Red Tories as not being \\"true conservatives\\". He finished a distant sixth of eight contestants on the second ballot; Joe Clark won the leadership. Hellyer rejoined the Liberal Party in 1982, but remained mostly silent in politics. In 1988, he contested the Liberal nomination in the Toronto riding of St. Paul's, losing to Aideen Nicholson, who had defeated Hellyer 14 years previously when he was a Tory MP in the adjacent riding of Trinity. Canadian Action Party In 1997, Hellyer formed the Canadian Action Party (CAP) to provide voters with an economic nationalist option following the collapse of the National Party of Canada. Hellyer believed that both the Progressive Conservative and Liberal parties were embracing globalization, and that the New Democratic Party was no longer able to provide a credible alternative. CAP also embraced Hellyer's proposals for monetary reform: that the government should become more involved in the direction of the economy by gradually reducing the creation of private money and increasing the creation of public money from the current ratio of 5% public / 95% private back to 50% public and 50% private. His party remained a little-noticed minor party, and Hellyer lost bids for a seat in the House of Commons of Canada in the 1997 and 2000 elections. Following the 2000 election, and a resurgence for the New Democratic Party, Hellyer approached NDP leadership to discuss the possibility of merging the two parties into 'One Big Party'. This process was furthered by the passage of a unanimous motion at the CAP's convention in 2003. In early 2004, after several extensions of the merger deadline, the NDP rejected Hellyer's merger proposal which would have required the NDP to change its name. Hellyer resigned as CAP leader, but remains a member of the party. Rumours that he might run for the NDP in the 2004 election proved to be unfounded. Extraterrestrial intelligence claims On 3 June 1967, Hellyer flew in by helicopter to officially inaugurate an unidentified flying object landing pad in St. Paul, Alberta. The town had built it as its Canadian Centennial celebration project, and as a symbol of keeping space free from human warfare. The sign beside the pad reads: > The area under the World's First UFO Landing Pad was designated > international by the Town of St. Paul as a symbol of our faith that mankind > will maintain the outer universe free from national wars and strife. That > future travel in space will be safe for all intergalactic beings, all > visitors from earth or otherwise are welcome to this territory and to the > Town of St. Paul.http://www.abheritage.ca/stvincent- > stpaul/st_paul/community_UFO_en.html In early September 2005, Hellyer made headlines by publicly announcing that he believed in the existence of UFOs. On 25 September 2005, he was an invited speaker at an exopolitics conference in Toronto, where he told the audience that he had seen a UFO one night with his late wife and some friends. He said that, although he had discounted the experience at the time, he had kept an open mind to it. He said that he started taking the issue much more seriously after watching ABC's UFO special in February 2005. In 2007, the Ottawa Citizen reported that Hellyer is demanding that world governments disclose alien technology that could be used to solve the problem of climate change: > I would like to see what (alien) technology there might be that could > eliminate the burning of fossil fuels within a generation...that could be a > way to save our planet...We need to persuade governments to come clean on > what they know. Some of us suspect they know quite a lot, and it might be > enough to save our planet if applied quickly enough.Ottawa Citizen (28 > February 2007). Alien technology the best hope to 'save our planet': ex- > defence boss. Ottawa Citizen, 28 February 2007. Retrieved on 2008-04-30 from > . In an interview with RT (formerly Russia Today) in 2014, Hellyer said that at least four species of aliens have been visiting Earth for thousands of years, with most of them coming from other star systems, although there are some living on Venus, Mars and Saturn‚Äôs moon. According to him, they \\"don't think we are good stewards of our planet.\\" Personal life Hellyer was one of the earliest investors in the Toronto Sun in 1971.\\"Play it again, Paul: Hellyer fights to run as Liberal\\", Cruickshank, John.

He is known for his contribution to the Comte de Buffon's great work, the Histoire Naturelle. Biography Armorial Œøf Bernard-Germain- √âtienne de La Ville-sur-Illon, comte de Lac√©p√®de. Lac√©p√®de was born at Agen in Guienne. His education was carefully conducted by his father, and the early perusal of Buffon's Natural History (Histoire naturelle, g√©n√©rale et particuli√®re) awakened his interest in that branch of study, which absorbed his chief attention. His leisure he devoted to music, in which, besides becoming a good performer on the piano and organ, he acquired considerable mastery of composition, two of his operas (which were never published) meeting with the high approval of Gluck; in 1781‚Äì1785 he also brought out in two volumes his Po√©tique de la musique. Meantime he wrote two treatises, Essai sur l'√©lectricit√© (1781) and Physique g√©n√©rale et particuli√®re (1782‚Äì1784), which gained him the friendship of Buffon, who in 1785 appointed him subdemonstrator in the Jardin du Roi, and proposed that he continue Buffon's Histoire naturelle. This continuation was published under the titles Histoire naturelle des quadrup√®des ovipares et des serpents. Tome premier (1788) and Histoire naturelle des serpents. Tome second (1789). The Jardin des Plantes and the Mus√©um National d'Histoire Naturelle. After the French Revolution Lac√©p√®de became a member of the Legislative Assembly, but during the Reign of Terror he left Paris, his life having become endangered by his disapproval of the massacres. When the Jardin du Roi was reorganised as the Jardin des Plantes and as the Mus√©um National d'Histoire Naturelle in 1793, Lac√©p√®de was appointed to the chair allocated to the study of reptiles and fishes. In 1798, he published the first volume of Histoire naturelle des poissons, the fifth volume appearing in 1803, and in 1804 appeared his Histoire des c√©tac√©es. From this period until his death the part he took in politics prevented him making any further contribution of importance to science. In 1799, he became a senator, in 1801 president of the senate (a role he also fulfilled in 1807‚Äì08 and 1811‚Äì13), in 1803 grand chancellor of the Legion of Honor, in 1804 minister of state, and at the Bourbon Restoration in 1819 he was created a peer of France. He died at √âpinay-sur-Seine. During the latter part of his life he wrote Histoire g√©n√©rale physique et civile de l'Europe, published posthumously in 18 volumes, 1826.Bust of Bernard-Germain de Lac√©p√®de by alt= He was elected perpetual secretary of the French Academy of Sciences at the Institute of France in 1796, a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1806 and a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1812. Lac√©p√®de was initiated into freemasonry at 22 years old at Les Neuf S≈ìurs lodge in Paris, by J√©r√¥me Lalande the worshipfull master himself, who wanted a naturalist for his prestigious lodge. In 1785, Lac√©p√®de created his own lodge : \\"Les Fr√®res Initi√©s\\". After the Revolution, he helped Cambac√©r√®s to rebuild a French freemasonry submitted to the Emperor, and joined \\"Saint-Napol√©on\\" lodge where General Kellermann was worshipfull master. He finished his masonic life as dignitary of the Supr√™me Conseil de France.Dictionnaire universelle de la Franc-Ma√ßonnerie (Marc de Jode, Monique Cara and Jean-Marc Cara, ed.

It is one of the building blocks needed for the synthesis of RNA during the transcription process. Its structure is similar to that of the guanosine nucleoside, the only difference being that nucleotides like GTP have phosphates on their ribose sugar. GTP has the guanine nucleobase attached to the 1' carbon of the ribose and it has the triphosphate moiety attached to ribose‚Äôs 5' carbon. It also has the role of a source of energy or an activator of substrates in metabolic reactions, like that of ATP, but more specific. It is used as a source of energy for protein synthesis and gluconeogenesis. GTP is essential to signal transduction, in particular with G-proteins, in second- messenger mechanisms where it is converted to guanosine diphosphate (GDP) through the action of GTPases. Uses =Energy transfer= GTP is involved in energy transfer within the cell. For instance, a GTP molecule is generated by one of the enzymes in the citric acid cycle. This is tantamount to the generation of one molecule of ATP, since GTP is readily converted to ATP with nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (NDK). =Genetic translation= During the elongation stage of translation, GTP is used as an energy source for the binding of a new amino-bound tRNA to the A site of the ribosome. GTP is also used as an energy source for the translocation of the ribosome towards the 3' end of the mRNA. =Microtubule dynamic instability= During microtubule polymerization, each heterodimer formed by an alpha and a beta tubulin molecule carries two GTP molecules, and the GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP when the tubulin dimers are added to the plus end of the growing microtubule. Such GTP hydrolysis is not mandatory for microtubule formation, but it appears that only GDP-bound tubulin molecules are able to depolymerize. Thus, a GTP-bound tubulin serves as a cap at the tip of microtubule to protect from depolymerization; and, once the GTP is hydrolyzed, the microtubule begins to depolymerize and shrink rapidly. =Mitochondrial function= The translocation of proteins into the mitochondrial matrix involves the interactions of both GTP and ATP. The importing of these proteins plays an important role in several pathways regulated within the mitochondria organelle, such as converting oxaloacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) in gluconeogenesis. Biosynthesis In the cell, GTP is synthesised through many processes including: * as a byproduct of the Succinyl-CoA to Succinate conversion catalysed by the Succinyl-CoA synthetase enzyme as part of the Krebs cycle; * through exchanges of phosphate groups from ATP molecules by the Nucleoside-diphosphate kinase, an enzyme tasked with maintaining an equilibrium between the concentrations of different nucleoside triphosphates. cGTP Cyclic guanosine triphosphate (cGTP) helps cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) activate cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels in the olfactory system.

These rules, which are used for carrying out the inference of theorems from axioms, are the logical calculus of the formal system. A formal system is essentially an \\"axiomatic system\\". Fourth-century BCE philologist PƒÅ·πáini is credited with the first use of formal system in Sanskrit grammar. In 1921, David Hilbert proposed to use such system as the foundation for the knowledge in mathematics. A formal system may represent a well-defined system of abstract thought. The term formalism is sometimes a rough synonym for formal system, but it also refers to a given style of notation, for example, Paul Dirac's bra‚Äìket notation. Background Each formal system uses primitive symbols (which collectively form an alphabet) to finitely construct a formal language from a set of axioms through inferential rules of formation. The system thus consists of valid formulas built up through finite combinations of the primitive symbols‚Äîcombinations that are formed from the axioms in accordance with the stated rules.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Formal system definition, 2007. More formally, this can be expressed as the following: # A finite set of symbols, known as the alphabet, which concatenate formulas, so that a formula is just a finite string of symbols taken from the alphabet. # A grammar consisting of rules to form formulas from simpler formulas. A formula is said to be well-formed if it can be formed using the rules of the formal grammar. It is often required that there be a decision procedure for deciding whether a formula is well-formed. # A set of axioms, or axiom schemata, consisting of well-formed formulas. # A set of inference rules. A well-formed formula that can be inferred from the axioms is known as a theorem of the formal system. =Recursive= A formal system is said to be recursive (i.e. effective) or recursively enumerable if the set of axioms and the set of inference rules are decidable sets or semidecidable sets, respectively. =Inference and entailment= The entailment of the system by its logical foundation is what distinguishes a formal system from others which may have some basis in an abstract model. Often the formal system will be the basis for or even identified with a larger theory or field (e.g. Euclidean geometry) consistent with the usage in modern mathematics such as model theory.  Formal language  A formal language is a language that is defined by a formal system. Like languages in linguistics, formal languages generally have two aspects: * the syntax of a language is what the language looks like (more formally: the set of possible expressions that are valid utterances in the language) studied in formal language theory * the semantics of a language are what the utterances of the language mean (which is formalized in various ways, depending on the type of language in question) In computer science and linguistics usually only the syntax of a formal language is considered via the notion of a formal grammar. A formal grammar is a precise description of the syntax of a formal language: a set of strings. The two main categories of formal grammar are that of generative grammars, which are sets of rules for how strings in a language can be generated, and that of analytic grammars (or reductive grammar,Reductive grammar: (computer science) A set of syntactic rules for the analysis of strings to determine whether the strings exist in a language. About the Author Compiled by The Editors of the McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science & Technology (New York, NY) an in-house staff who represents the cutting-edge of skill, knowledge, and innovation in science publishing. \\"There are two classes of formal-language definition compiler-writing schemes. The productive grammar approach is the most common. A productive grammar consists primarrly of a set of rules that describe a method of generating all possible strings of the language. The reductive or analytical grammar technique states a set of rules that describe a method of analyzing any string of characters and deciding whether that string is in the language.\\" ) which are sets of rules for how a string can be analyzed to determine whether it is a member of the language. In short, an analytic grammar describes how to recognize when strings are members in the set, whereas a generative grammar describes how to write only those strings in the set. In mathematics, a formal language is usually not described by a formal grammar but by (a) natural language, such as English. Logical systems are defined by both a deductive system and natural language. Deductive systems in turn are only defined by natural language (see below).  Deductive system  A deductive system, also called a deductive apparatus or a logic, consists of the axioms (or axiom schemata) and rules of inference that can be used to derive theorems of the system.Hunter, Geoffrey, Metalogic: An Introduction to the Metatheory of Standard First-Order Logic, University of California Pres, 1971 Such deductive systems preserve deductive qualities in the formulas that are expressed in the system. Usually the quality we are concerned with is truth as opposed to falsehood. However, other modalities, such as justification or belief may be preserved instead. In order to sustain its deductive integrity, a deductive apparatus must be definable without reference to any intended interpretation of the language. The aim is to ensure that each line of a derivation is merely a syntactic consequence of the lines that precede it. There should be no element of any interpretation of the language that gets involved with the deductive nature of the system. An example of deductive system is first order predicate logic.  Logical system  A logical system or language (not be confused with the kind of \\"formal language\\" discussed above which is described by a formal grammar), is a deductive system (see section above; most commonly first order predicate logic) together with additional (non-logical) axioms and a semantics. According to model-theoretic interpretation, the semantics of a logical system describe whether a well-formed formula is satisfied by a given structure. A structure that satisfies all the axioms of the formal system is known as a model of the logical system. A logical system is sound if each well-formed formula that can be inferred from the axioms is satisfied by every model of the logical system. Conversely, a logic system is complete if each well-formed formula that is satisfied by every model of the logical system can be inferred from the axioms. An example of a logical system is Peano arithmetic. History Early logic systems includes Indian logic of PƒÅ·πáini, syllogistic logic of Aristotle, propositional logic of Stoicism, and Chinese logic of Gongsun Long (c. 325‚Äì250 BCE) . In more recent times, contributors include George Boole, Augustus De Morgan, and Gottlob Frege. Mathematical logic was developed in 19th century Europe. =Formalism= Hilbert's program David Hilbert instigated a formalist movement that was eventually tempered by G√∂del's incompleteness theorems. =QED manifesto= The QED manifesto represented a subsequent, as yet unsuccessful, effort at formalization of known mathematics.  Examples  Examples of formal systems include: * Axiomatic system * Formal ethics * Lambda calculus * Proof calculus Variants The following systems are variations of formal systems. = Proof system = Formal proofs are sequences of well-formed formulas (or wff for short). For a wff to qualify as part of a proof, it might either be an axiom or be the product of applying an inference rule on previous wffs in the proof sequence. The last wff in the sequence is recognized as a theorem. The point of view that generating formal proofs is all there is to mathematics is often called formalism. David Hilbert founded metamathematics as a discipline for discussing formal systems. Any language that one uses to talk about a formal system is called a metalanguage. The metalanguage may be a natural language, or it may be partially formalized itself, but it is generally less completely formalized than the formal language component of the formal system under examination, which is then called the object language, that is, the object of the discussion in question. Once a formal system is given, one can define the set of theorems which can be proved inside the formal system. This set consists of all wffs for which there is a proof. Thus all axioms are considered theorems. Unlike the grammar for wffs, there is no guarantee that there will be a decision procedure for deciding whether a given wff is a theorem or not. The notion of theorem just defined should not be confused with theorems about the formal system, which, in order to avoid confusion, are usually called metatheorems.

It is loosely considered a zero-player game, in the sense that once the player has set up their artificial character, there is no user interaction at all; the game \\"plays\\" itself, with the human player as spectator. The game's source code was released in 2011. Gameplay On starting a new game, the player is presented with a few options, such as the choice of race and character class for their player character. Stats are rolled and unrolled to determine Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Players start off with subpar equipment, eventually earning better weapons, armor, and spells. Almost none of the above-mentioned character statistics and equipment have any effect on gameplay, however. The only exception is the Strength stat, which affects carrying capacity, indirectly influencing the speed of level gain. After character creation the game runs its course. The game displays the character's stats on the screen, including several progress bars representing how far the player character has advanced in the game. The lengthy, combat free prologue is represented by a set of progress bars, each accompanied by a line of text describing, among other things, the \\"foreboding vision\\" the character has. Then the first act begins, and the character is \\"heading to the killing fields...\\" where they will start the endless cycle of \\"executing (number of monsters) (adjective of monsters) (monster type)\\" or \\"executing a passing (player character)\\", only disrupted when their strength is no longer sufficient to carry more items. This forces their return to the market, where they will sell all the loot (each group of monsters drops one monster-specific item of loot, player characters will drop random magic loot) and then spend all their accumulated money to buy equipment. With each group of monsters \\"executed\\" the quest progress bar will advance one step; once it is filled it will be reset and the player awarded either with a magic item, a piece of equipment or a stats upgrade including the learning or leveling of a spell. After a fixed amount of time, the player will enter a new act, which has no effect whatsoever. All equipment in the game is randomly given out as a reward for several instances in the game such as completing a quest, killing certain enemies, leveling a character, and especially when at the market, in which the character uses gold from the loot to upgrade his or her equipment. These items usually consist of two adjectives and a noun. Like the games Progress Quest mocks, these items have statistics and the adjectives are variables describing the item. The character level is used to determine what stats and adjectives each item has. Players may choose to create an account offline for their own enjoyment, or create an online account that allows their character stats to be saved on a ranking website. This allows characters to compare their accomplishments with others while trying to achieve a higher ranking on their respective realm. Players can also join guilds of Good, Neutral, or Evil alignment in certain realms, though there is no benefit for doing so. Plot The story tells of the history of Grumdrig and the creation of the realms. Currently, there are five realms: Knoram, Expodrine, Oobag, Spoltog, and Pemptus. The latter two are still open, but Knoram, Expodrine, and Oobag were permanently closed to the creation of new characters upon the arrival of Pemptus, which, being the newest realm, launched on February 8, 2007. The story mimics convoluted fantasy plots, using archaic and made up words such as \\"aberdoxy\\". Development Progress Quest parodies the stat-gathering aspect of role-playing video games, whereby the player advances their character by accumulating arbitrary statistic points. EverQuest and many other MMORPGs of its time are infamous for their \\"auto-attack\\" combat system, where players press a button to initiate combat mode and, from then on, have little to do other than watch; Progress Quest mocks this with its totally non-interactive gameplay after the initial character setup. Progress Quest also pokes fun at traditional RPG races, classes, stories, quests, items, and more. The program was made available by Eric Fredricksen in early 2002. Fans quickly joined in on the parody by submitting numerous fake reviews to several popular freeware download sites and game review sites giving Progress Quest the highest scores possible. The game has been upgraded several times throughout its history. One particular upgrade added shaded bars to the screen, which caused some players to refer to the new version as Progress Quest 3D. On the \\"game's\\" official forums, a popular in-joke leads newbies to believe that there exist Silver, Gold, Platinum or even Diamond-encrusted DVD versions of the game which have enhanced 3D graphics. Fake \\"Progress Quest\\" screenshots from other games, obscure 3D RPGs, helped spread this rumour. On May 20, 2011, Eric Fredricksen released the source code of the game on bitbucket.Source Code ReleasedProgressQuest v6.3pq on bitbucket.org Reception Critics have commented that, despite the automatic progress, Progress Quest was an enjoyable experience. Reviewer Nick Hide compared this with other MMORPGs in which players persevere through dull tasks, just to level up or obtain a new item, owing to an emotional attachment with the character. Progress Quest arguably represents the first example of a genre of casual game called the \\"idle RPG\\" or \\"incremental game\\", popular on certain web sites. These games generally feature a complex progress system in which progress is made automatically with the passage of time, but unlike Progress Quest, there are often decisions to be made by the player in terms of allocating resources between stats that do affect the game in order that the idled time should be used as efficiently as possible.

Her 1975 appearance on the television talent show Opportunity Knocks led to appearances on other TV and radio shows, a one-woman touring stage show and performing before The Queen. Early life Pam Ayres was born in Stanford in the Vale, Berkshire, now administered as part of Oxfordshire. After leaving Faringdon Secondary School at the age of 15, she joined the Civil Service as a clerical assistant and worked at the Army (RAOC) Central Ordnance Depot in Bicester. She soon left and signed up for the Women's Royal Air Force, where she trained as a Plotter Air Photographer, working at JARIC in a drawing office dealing with operational maps. Whilst serving in the air force, she gained O-level passes in English language and English literature and began her career as an entertainer. She began reading her verses at the local folk club in Oxfordshire, and this led to an invitation to read on the local BBC Radio station in 1974. Her reading was re-broadcast nationally, and then broadcast again as an item in the BBC's Pick of the Year. Bob Dylan inspired Ayres to write poetry, and in a 2006 interview she added that, at the age of twelve, she enjoyed writing parodies of the Lonnie Donegan songs popular at that time. Career In 1975, Ayres appeared on the television talent show Opportunity Knocks. This led to a wide variety of guest appearances on TV and radio shows. Since then she has published six books of poems, toured in a one-woman stage show, hosted her own TV show and performed her stage show for the Queen. Her poetry has a deceptively simple style and deals with everyday subject matter. Her poem \\"Oh, I Wish I'd Looked After Me Teeth\\", was voted into the Top 10 of a BBC poll to find the nation's 100 Favourite Comic Poems. In the UK Arts Council's report on poetry, Ayres was identified as the fifth best-selling poet in Britain in 1998 and 1999. Ayres continues to perform her work, the humorous quality of which is enhanced by her idiosyncratic delivery and by her distinctive North Berkshire accent. From 1996, Ayres has appeared frequently on BBC Radio: from 1996 until 1999 Ayres presented a two-hour music and chat show every Sunday afternoon on BBC Radio 2; this was followed by two series of Pam Ayres' Open Road, in which she visited various parts of the United Kingdom, interviewing people with interesting stories to tell about their lives and local areas. More recently Ayres has become a regular contributor to BBC Radio 4, appearing in programmes such as Just a Minute, Say the Word, That Reminds Me, and two series of her own show, Ayres on the Air, a radio show of her poetry and sketches.Pam Ayres In 2007, Ayres acted in a radio sitcom, Potting On for Radio 4, co-starring Geoffrey Whitehead. She wrote and recorded six series of her Radio 4 programme Ayres on the Air, the latest of which was broadcast in 2018. Since 2002 Ayres has appeared a number of times on Channel 4 in Countdown's Dictionary Corner alongside Susie Dent. In 2009, she made her first appearance on the BBC TV programme, QI. In 2011 she said in a Daily Telegraph magazine interview that she was \\"about to go on my 14th tour of Australia\\". Her biography, The Necessary Aptitude: A Memoir, was published in 2011. It traces her life and career from growing as the youngest of six children in a council house in the Vale of White Horse, Berkshire, her time in the Women's Royal Air Force and the string of events that led to Opportunity Knocks. The title refers to the number of times she was told in her life she \\"did not have the necessary aptitude\\". In 2013 she published her latest book of poems, entitled You Made me Late Again! =Influence= The poet John Cooper Clarke has cited Ayres' early success on Opportunity Knocks as being highly influential on his career. Personal life Ayres is married to theatre producer Dudley Russell, and they have two sons, William and James. They live in the Cotswolds and keep rare breeds of cattle, as well as sheep, pigs, chickens, and guinea fowl. Ayres is a keen gardener and beekeeper.Pam Ayres - Biography She is a patron of the British Hen Welfare Trust, Cheltenham Animal Shelter and Oak and Furrows Wildlife Rescue Centre. Ayres was the guest on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs in 1979 and again in 2018. In 2004, she was appointed MBE for services to literature and entertainment.

In 1954, at the age of fifteen, she was convicted in the murder of her friend's mother. She changed her name after serving a five-year sentence. Early life Born in Blackheath, London, the daughter of physicist Dr. Henry Rainsford Hulme, Perry was diagnosed with tuberculosis as a child and sent to the Caribbean and South Africa in hopes that a warmer climate would improve her health. A 1948 Auckland Star photograph of Juliet arriving in New Zealand was discovered by Auckland Libraries staff and written about in the Heritage et AL blog. She rejoined her family when she was 13 after her father took a position as Rector of Canterbury University College in New Zealand. She attended Christchurch Girls' High School, located in what became the Cranmer Centre. Murder and trial In June 1954, at the age of 15, Hulme and her best friend Pauline Parker murdered Parker's mother, Honorah Rieper.Honora used the surname Rieper although she was never legally married to Herbert Rieper. Hulme's parents were in the process of separating and she was supposed to go to South Africa to stay with a relative. The two teenage friends, who had created a rich fantasy life together populated with famous actors such as James Mason and Orson Welles, did not want to be separated. On 22 June 1954, the girls and Honorah Rieper went for a walk in Victoria Park in their hometown of Christchurch. On an isolated path Hulme dropped an ornamental stone so that Rieper would lean over to retrieve it. Parker had planned to hit her mother with half a brick wrapped in a stocking. The girls presumed that one blow would kill her but it took more than 20. Parker and Hulme stood trial in Christchurch in 1954 and were found guilty on 29 August that year. As they were too young to be considered for the death penalty under New Zealand law at the time, they were convicted and sentenced to be \\"detained at Her Majesty's pleasure\\". In practice they were detained at the discretion of the Minister of Justice. They were released separately five years later. Parker and Hulme are not believed to have had any contact since the trial. The events formed the basis for the 1994 film Heavenly Creatures, in which Melanie Lynskey portrayed a teenage Pauline Parker and Kate Winslet the teenaged Juliet Hulme. At the time of the film's release, it was not generally known that mystery author \\"Anne Perry\\" was Juliet Hulme, whose identity was made public some months after the film's release. Although some presumed Hulme and Parker's relationship to be sexual, Perry stated in 2006 that, while the relationship was obsessive, the two \\"were never lesbians\\". Later life After being released from prison in November 1959, Hulme returned to England and became a flight attendant. For a period she lived in the United States, where she joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1968. She later settled in the Scottish village of Portmahomack where she lived with her mother. Her father had a distinguished scientific career, heading the British hydrogen bomb programme. Hulme took the name Anne Perry, using her stepfather's surname. Her first novel, The Cater Street Hangman, was published under this name in 1979. Her works generally fall into one of several categories of genre fiction, including historical murder mysteries and detective fiction. Many feature recurring characters, most importantly Thomas Pitt, who appeared in her first novel, and amnesiac private investigator William Monk, who first appeared in her 1990 novel The Face of a Stranger. By 2003 she had published 47 novels, and several collections of short stories. Her story \\"Heroes\\", which first appeared in the 1999 anthology Murder and Obsession, edited by Otto Penzler, won the 2001 Edgar Award for Best Short Story. In 2005, Perry appeared on the Trisha show to discuss the crime on a special themed show. A 2009 documentary film, Anne Perry Interiors, gave a snapshot of her life and the people close to her.IMDb In 2017, Anne Perry left Scotland and moved to Hollywood in order to more effectively promote films based on her novels. Bibliography Each series is listed in internal chronological order, according to the author's website. The two main series each feature a male and a female protagonist. Thomas Pitt is matched with Charlotte; her female society relatives help in the mysteries out of boredom. William Monk is matched with Hester Latterly, a Crimean War nurse. The Monk mysteries are set earlier in the Victorian era (1850s‚Äì1860s) than the Pitt books (1880s‚Äì1890s). Hester plays a very strong role in these stories; in some cases she is a better investigator than Monk. The Christmas stories involve minor characters such as sisters, bosses, or grandmothers in a personal crisis at a later Christmas time with a strongly enforced redemption message at the end. =Featuring Thomas Pitt= #

Sid Field in 1949 Early years He was born in Ladywood, Birmingham, Warwickshire, son of Albert (a canemaker) and Bertha (a dressmaker). Field spent most of his childhood in Birmingham. He had entertainment in his blood from an early age. As a child he charged his friends \\"admission\\" to his back garden impression shows. Also, he was busking and performing to the queues at his local cinema dressed as Charlie Chaplin (once being cautioned by police for his activities). Field was later praised by Chaplin himself, at whose parties Field was a regular invitee. Field grew up in Birmingham, where he was educated at Conway Road, Stratford Road and Golden Hillock Road schools, and attended Sunday school at Emmanuel Church, Walford Road. His cousins, \\"the Workmans\\", performed in concerts at Moseley Road Swimming Baths in the city, where Field made his stage debut, singing \\"What A Life\\" at the age of nine. His first professional engagement, with \\"The Kino Royal Juveniles\\", at seven shillings and sixpence (37¬Ωp) per week, came in July 1916, after his mother responded to an advert in the Birmingham Mail. He later worked as an understudy to Wee Georgie Wood in a Birmingham pantomime, then appeared in review at the Bordesley Palace and the Mission Hall in Church Road, Yardley. To assuage the young Sid's stage fright, Bertha gave him a glass of port to drink: by the age of 13, he was dependent on alcohol. He was godfather to John Blackburn. Success and legacy Field was unusual among comedy performers of the day, as his act was a multitude of characters and impersonations, at a time when most variety (vaudeville) acts were \\"one trick ponies\\". Despite this comedic and acting flair, it was not until he had spent decades touring provincial music halls that Field finally broke into the big time, appearing in London's West End as Slasher Green, the Cockney \\"wide boy\\" or \\"spiv\\". He became an \\"overnight\\" star. In Strike a New Note (1943), Strike it Again (1944) and Piccadilly Hayride (1946), he had his audiences roaring with laughter. One reviewer commented that he was the only comedian who had the audience literally \\"falling off their seats with laughter\\". He was loved for his routines involving a naive approach to the billiards table and the golf course, played with his straight man, Jerry Desmonde. (For example, Desmonde, sternly, as golf pro: \\"Address the ball!\\" Field: (trying hard) \\"...Dear Ball....\\") Terry-Thomas acted as compere for the shows, and appeared with Field in one of the sketches. On 5 November 1945, Field appeared in the Royal Variety Performance. Appearing again in 1946, he became one of the few artists to make an appearance in two consecutive Royal Performances. 18 months later in 1948, Field was topping the bill at the London Palladium, replacing Mickey Rooney. Field had a starring role in That's the Ticket (1940) but London Town (1946) is often referred to as his first film in error. Some of his best remembered sketches are preserved here. Field made one more film, The Cardboard Cavalier (as Sidcup Buttermeadow), co- starring with Margaret Lockwood. However, the cinematic world was not Field's most effective medium, and his films were neither critical nor commercial successes. It is perhaps because of this lack of recorded material on film or TV, that Field is now largely forgotten. Only the three films and some recorded variety material survive. He inspired a generation of comedians and pioneered the use of character acting in comedy. He was cited as a comic favourite by Tony Hancock (an influence too), Eric Morecambe, Eric Sykes, Frankie Howerd and Tommy Cooper, among many others, and he was described by Bob Hope as being 'probably the best comedian of them all.' Laurence Olivier, during an interview with Kenneth Tynan in 1966, cited Field as a strong influence on his acting, saying, 'Of all people I have ever watched with the greatest delight, I think, was in another field entirely, was Sid Field‚Ä¶ I still borrow from him, freely and unashamedly.' His only straight role came in 1950 in Mary Chase's play Harvey, (as Elwood P. Dowd, the role played in the 1950 film by James Stewart). On 3 February 1950, during the run of this play, Field died from a heart attack at his home in Richmond, Surrey. He was 45. He is survived by a daughter, Diane Abbott of Hastings in Sussex, England, and a son, John Nicholas Field of Santa Ana, CA, USA, and their children: Katy, Sarah, and Matthew Abbott, and Vita and Joa Chester's-Field. Another daughter, Elaine, is deceased. Later that month, a memorial service was held at London's St Martin-in-the-Fields, with lessons read by Laurence Olivier and Ted Ray. A midnight matinee benefit for his wife and children, held on 25 June 1951, was attended by the Duchess of Kent, Aneurin Bevan and No√´l Coward. The cast list included Jack Hylton, Bud Flanagan, Arthur Askey, Tommy Trinder, all six of the original Crazy Gang, Peter Ustinov, George Robey and many more, totalling over 240. There is a blue plaque commemorating Sid Field on the front of 152 Osborn Road, where he grew up, and a memorial in the foyer of the Prince of Wales Theatre in London, which says: > To the memory of the great comedian Sid Field, who made his first appearance > in the West End at this theatre on 18 March 1943 and who played his last > performance here on 2 February 1950. In 1994 the actor David Suchet played Sid Field in a stage play of his life (What a Performance), and in October 2011 Suchet followed this up as the presenter of a BBC4 documentary about Sid Field. In the programme Suchet meets stars such as Eric Sykes, Leslie Phillips and Nicholas Parsons who remember Field's epic stage shows.

It began as a Galois module theory of ideal class groups, initiated by (), as part of the theory of cyclotomic fields. In the early 1970s, Barry Mazur considered generalizations of Iwasawa theory to abelian varieties. More recently (early 1990s), Ralph Greenberg has proposed an Iwasawa theory for motives. Formulation Iwasawa worked with so-called \\\\Z_p-extensions: infinite extensions of a number field F with Galois group \\\\Gamma isomorphic to the additive group of p-adic integers for some prime p. Every closed subgroup of \\\\Gamma is of the form \\\\Gamma^{p^n}, so by Galois theory, a \\\\Z_p-extension F_\\\\infty/F is the same thing as a tower of fields :F=F_0 \\\\subset F_1 \\\\subset F_2 \\\\subset \\\\cdots \\\\subset F_\\\\infty such that \\\\operatorname{Gal}(F_n/F)\\\\cong \\\\Z/p^n\\\\Z. Iwasawa studied classical Galois modules over F_n by asking questions about the structure of modules over F_\\\\infty. More generally, Iwasawa theory asks questions about the structure of Galois modules over extensions with Galois group a p-adic Lie group. Example Let p be a prime number and let K=\\\\Q(\\\\mu_p) be the field generated over \\\\Q by the pth roots of unity. Iwasawa considered the following tower of number fields: : K = K_{0} \\\\subset K_{1} \\\\subset \\\\cdots \\\\subset K_{\\\\infty}, where K_n is the field generated by adjoining to K the pn+1-st roots of unity and :K_\\\\infty = \\\\bigcup K_n. The fact that \\\\operatorname{Gal}(K_n/K)\\\\simeq \\\\Z/p^n\\\\Z implies, by infinite Galois theory, that \\\\operatorname{Gal}(K_{\\\\infty}/K) \\\\simeq \\\\Z_p. In order to get an interesting Galois module, Iwasawa took the ideal class group of K_n, and let I_n be its p-torsion part. There are norm maps I_m\\\\to I_n whenever m>n, and this gives us the data of an inverse system. If we set :I = \\\\varprojlim I_n, then it is not hard to see from the inverse limit construction that I is a module over \\\\Z_p. In fact, I is a module over the Iwasawa algebra \\\\Lambda=\\\\Z_p\\\\Gamma. This is a 2-dimensional, regular local ring, and this makes it possible to describe modules over it. From this description it is possible to recover information about the p-part of the class group of K. The motivation here is that the p-torsion in the ideal class group of K had already been identified by Kummer as the main obstruction to the direct proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. Connections with p-adic analysis From this beginning in the 1950s, a substantial theory has been built up. A fundamental connection was noticed between the module theory, and the p-adic L-functions that were defined in the 1960s by Kubota and Leopoldt. The latter begin from the Bernoulli numbers, and use interpolation to define p-adic analogues of the Dirichlet L-functions. It became clear that the theory had prospects of moving ahead finally from Kummer's century-old results on regular primes. Iwasawa formulated the main conjecture of Iwasawa theory as an assertion that two methods of defining p-adic L-functions (by module theory, by interpolation) should coincide, as far as that was well-defined. This was proved by for \\\\Q and for all totally real number fields by . These proofs were modeled upon Ken Ribet's proof of the converse to Herbrand's theorem (the so-called Herbrand‚ÄìRibet theorem). Karl Rubin found a more elementary proof of the Mazur-Wiles theorem by using Kolyvagin's Euler systems, described in and , and later proved other generalizations of the main conjecture for imaginary quadratic fields. Generalizations The Galois group of the infinite tower, the starting field, and the sort of arithmetic module studied can all be varied. In each case, there is a main conjecture linking the tower to a p-adic L-function. In 2002, Chris Skinner and Eric Urban claimed a proof of a main conjecture for GL(2). In 2010, they posted a preprint .

He is considered as one of the greatest and most successful actors in the Indian film industry. Early life Anand was born Dharam Dev Anand on 26 September 1923Dev Anand (2007) Romancing With Life, An Autobiography. Penguin/Viking. p. 1 . in the Shakargarh tehsil of the Gurdaspur district in Punjab (British India). His father Pishori Lal Anand was a well-to-do advocate in Gurdaspur District Court. Dev was the third of four sons born to Anand. One of Dev's younger sisters is Sheel Kanta Kapur, who is the mother of film director Shekhar Kapur. His older brothers were Manmohan Anand (Advocate, Gurdaspur Dist. Court) and Chetan Anand and the younger one was Vijay Anand. He did his schooling till matriculation from Sacred Heart School, Dalhousie, (then in Punjab) and went to Government college Dharamshala before going to Lahore to study. Later Dev completed a B.A. degree in English Literature from the Government College, Lahore in British India. Part of the Anand family, he co-founded Navketan Films in 1949 with his elder brother Chetan Anand. Career Anand on a 2013 stamp of India After completing his BA degree in English literature from the Government College, Lahore (then in British India, now in Pakistan), Dev Anand left his home-town for Bombay in the early 1940s. He began his career in the military censor's office at Churchgate, for a monthly salary of Rs. 65. Later, he worked as a clerk in an accounting firm for a salary of Rs. 85.88 Facts You Didn't Know About Dev Anand . Rediff.com (7 December 2011). Retrieved on 9 November 2018. He joined his older brother, Chetan, as a member of the Indian People's Theatre Association (IPTA). Dev Anand aspired to become a performer after seeing Ashok Kumar's performance in films such as Achhut Kanya and Kismet.88 Facts You Didn't Know About Dev Anand ‚Äì II . Rediff.com (8 December 2011). Retrieved on 9 November 2018. Dev Anand quoted in an interview that \\"I remember when I gate-crashed into the office of the man who gave me the first break, he kept looking at me ‚Äì Babu Rao Pai of Prabhat Film Studios. At that time he made up his mind that this boy deserves a break and later mentioned to his people that 'this boy struck me because of his smile and beautiful eyes and his tremendous confidence.'\\" Then he was soon offered the lead role in Prabhat Films' Hum Ek Hain (1946), a film about Hindu-Muslim unity, where Dev Anand played a Hindu boy and was paired opposite Kamala Kotnis. While shooting the film in Pune, Anand befriended the actor Guru Dutt. Between them, they agreed that if one of them were to become successful in the film industry, he would help the other also to be successful. They formed a mutual understanding that when Anand produced a film, Dutt would direct it and when Dutt directed a film, Anand would act in it. =Late 1940s and romance with Suraiya= In the late 1940s, Anand was offered a few roles starring as the male lead opposite singer-actress Suraiya in woman-oriented films. While shooting these films, they became romantically involved. The two of them were paired in seven films together: Vidya (1948), Jeet (1949), Shair (1949), Afsar (1950), Nili (1950), Do Sitare (1951) and Sanam (1951), all of which were successful at the box office. In these films, Suraiya was always first-biller in the credits, indicating that she was a bigger star than Anand. She fell in love with him during the shooting of the song Kinare Kinare Chale Jayen Ge from the film Vidya‚Äî while shooting the scene, the boat they were in capsized, and Anand saved Suraiya from drowning. Initially, Suraiya's family used to welcome Dev Anand at home, but when her maternal grandmother found out that the two were in love, and even planned an actual marriage on the set of Jeet, she started monitoring them. The two shared love letters and messages through their co-actors, like Durga Khote and Kamini Kaushal, who went out of their way to engineer secret rendezvous. During the shooting of the film Afsar (1950), Anand finally proposed to Suraiya and gave her a diamond ring worth Rs 3,000. Her maternal grandmother opposed the relationship as they were Muslim and Anand was Hindu, and so, Suraiya remained unmarried.How the Dev Anand-Suraiya love affair ended . Rediff.com (9 December 2011). Retrieved on 9 November 2018. They stopped acting together after her grandmother opposed their partnership, and Do Sitare was the last film in which they appeared together. Although the films he starred in with Suraiya had been successful, the producers and directors of those films attributed their success to the acting prowess and screen presence of Suraiya. Anand began looking for an opportunity to play the main male lead in a film where his acting skills could be demonstrated, so as to dispel scepticism about his acting abilities. Dev Anand often spoke about Suraiya and his love affair with her, in various interviews he gave to film magazines, such as Star Dust (June 1972 issue), Star & Style (Feb 1987 issue) and TV to Karan Thapar for BBC (2002), while both were alive, and after Suraiya's death in interviews given on TV to Simi Garewal (Rendezvouz with Simi Garewal) and others on TV and for news magazines. =Break and the 1950s= Anand was offered his first big break by Ashok Kumar. He spotted Anand hanging around in the studios and picked him as the hero for the Bombay Talkies production Ziddi (1948), co-starring Kamini Kaushal, which became an instant success. After Ziddis success, Anand decided that he would start producing films. It was in the film Ziddi, where the first ever Kishore-Lata duet, \\"Yeh Kaun Aaya Karke Yeh Sola Singhar\\", was recorded. This duet was an instant hit, and from here on both playback singers' associations with Dev Anand began. This continued for the next four decades. His association with Kishore Kumar started when the former sang the first solo of his playback singing career ‚Äì \\"Marne Ki Duayen\\" ‚Äì picturised on Dev Anand in the movie Ziddi. Dev had forged a very strong bond of friendship with Kishore Kumar during the making of the film. In 1949, he launched his own company Navketan Films (named after his elder brother Chetan's son Ketan and which means \\"New Banner\\"), which, as of 2011, has produced 35 films. Nirala, a commercial success, saw him being paired opposite Madhubala for the first time, with whom he would later for a popular pair. Dev chose Guru Dutt as director for the crime thriller, Baazi (1951). The film, starring Dev Anand, Geeta Bali and Kalpana Kartik was a trendsetter, regarded as the forerunner of the spate of urban crime films that followed in Bollywood in the 1950s. The film Baazi saw the debut of Kalpana Kartik (aka Mona Singha) as the lead female actress and Guru Dutt as a director. The collaboration was a success at the box office and the duo of Dev Anand and Kalpana Kartik were offered many films to star in together. They signed all the film offers and subsequently the movies Aandhiyan (1952), Taxi Driver (1954), House No. 44 (1955) and Nau Do Gyarah (1957) went on to become big hits too. During the making of the film Taxi Driver, the couple fell in love and Dev proposed marriage to his heroine Kalpana. In 1954, Taxi Driver was declared a hit and the two decided to marry in a quiet ceremony. The couple had a son, Suneil Anand in 1956 and later a daughter, Devina, was born. After her marriage, Kalpana decided not to pursue her acting career further. Nau Do Gyarah was the couple's last movie together. A rapid-fire style of dialogue delivery and a penchant for nodding while speaking became Dev's style in films such as House No. 44 (1955), Pocket Maar (1956), Munimji (1955), Funtoosh (1956), C.I.D. (1956) and Paying Guest (1957). In the 1950s his films were of the mystery genre or light comedy love stories or were films with social relevance such as Ek Ke Baad Ek (1959) and Funtoosh (1956). His style was lapped up by the audience and was widely imitated. He starred in a string of box office successes for the remainder of the 1950s opposite newcomer Waheeda Rehman in C.I.D. (1956), Solva Saal (1958), Kala Bazar (1960) and Baat Ek Raat Ki (1962). Waheeda first became a star when C.I.D became a hit. The pair acted in Roop Ki Rani Choron Ka Raja (1961 film) and Prem Pujari later. In 1955, he also co-starred with Dilip Kumar in Insaniyat. With his acting in the box office success Kala Pani (1958) opposite Madhubala and Nalini Jaywant, as the son who is willing to go to any lengths to clear his framed father's name, he won his first Filmfare award for Best Actor for the film. He attempted films of tragic genre occasionally, such as Pocket Maar (1956), Kala Pani (1958), Bombai Ka Baboo (1960) and Sharabi (1964) and tasted success with them. Dev also played a few characters with a negative shade, as in Jaal (1952) where he played a smuggler, then as an absconding gang member in Dushman (1957), and as a black marketer in Kala Bazar.Dev Anand: The eternal romantic and charming hero. India Today. 4 December 2011. Apart from his pairing with Suraiya and Kalpana Kartik, his pairing with Nutan and Waheeda Rehman was popular among the audiences in the late 50s and 60s. His films Rahi (1952) and Aandhiyan (1952), were screened along with Raj Kapoor's Awaara. From the early fifties till mid sixties, the trio of actors Dilip Kumar, Raj Kapoor and Anand ruled the roost. =Romantic hero image in the 1960s= In the sixties, Dev Anand acquired a romantic image with films such as Manzil and Tere Ghar Ke Samne with Nutan, Kinaare Kinaare with Meena Kumari, Maya with Mala Sinha, Asli- Naqli with Sadhana Shivdasani, Jab Pyar Kisi Se Hota Hai, Mahal with Asha Parekh and Teen Deviyaan opposite three heroines Kalpana, Simi Garewal and Nanda. In the film Teen Deviyaan, Dev Anand played a playboy. One of his notable films of the early sixties was Hum Dono (1961) which he produced and acted in, as Anand, a young lover who joins the army in frustration over being shunned by the father of his love Meeta (played by Sadhana Shivdasani). Anand played a double role in the film, also acting as Major Varma, his look-alike who he runs into in the army and forms a deep friendship with. Notable for its music by Jaidev, the film was a box office hit. His first colour film, Guide with Waheeda Rehman was based on the novel of the same name by R. K. Narayan. Dev Anand himself was the impetus for making the film version of the book. He met and persuaded Narayan to give his assent to the project. Dev Anand tapped his friends in Hollywood to launch an Indo-US co-production that was shot in Hindi and English simultaneously and was released in 1965. Guide, directed by younger brother Vijay Anand, was an acclaimed movie. Dev played Raju, a voluble guide, who supports Rosy (Waheeda) in her bid for freedom. He is not above thoughtlessly exploiting her for personal gains. Combining style with substance, he gave an affecting performance as a man grappling with his emotions in his passage through love, shame and salvation. He reunited with Vijay Anand for the movie Jewel Thief, based on the thriller genre which featured Vyjayanthimala, Tanuja, Anju Mahendru, Faryal and Helen and was very successful. Their next collaboration, Johny Mera Naam (1970), again a thriller, in which Dev was paired opposite Hema Malini was a big hit. It was Johnny Mera Naam which made Hema Malini a big star. In 1969, he was a member of the jury at the 6th Moscow International Film Festival. =Directorial debut and the Versatile Hero Image in 1970s= His directorial debut, the espionage drama Prem Pujari, was a flop but has developed a cult following over the years. The film introduced Zaheeda and had Waheeda Rehman as the lead female artiste. He tasted success with his 1971 directorial effort, Hare Rama Hare Krishna, shot primarily in Nepal around Swyambhunath, and Bhaktapur, in which talks about the prevalent hippie culture. His find Zeenat Aman, who played the mini-skirt sporting, pot-smoking Janice, became an overnight sensation. Dev also became known as a filmmaker of trenchantly topical themes. The same year, he starred with Mumtaz in Tere Mere Sapne, an adaptation of A. J. Cronin's novel, The Citadel. The film was directed by Dev's brother, Vijay and was also successful. In 1971 he paired again with Zaheeda in Gambler which went on to become a success. In the 1970s, Raj Kapoor started playing roles of fathers in films such as Kal Aaj Aur Kal in 1971 and Dharam Karam in 1974 and had put on a lot of weight and films with Dilip Kumar as lead hero like Dastaan and Bairaag were failures at the box office. Some of the hurriedly made films with Dev Anand as the leading man‚Äîthree each opposite Hema Malini ‚Äì Shareef Badmaash, Jaaneman, Joshila and two with Zeenat Aman ‚Äì Ishq Ishq Ishq, Prem Shastra and Saheb Bahadur with Priya Rajvansh ‚Äî became flops and posed a threat to his career as leading man. He bounced back with the double role film Banarasi Babu in 1973. He delivered commercial hits again with young heroines like with Sharmila Tagore in Yeh Gulistan Hamara, with Yogeeta Bali and Raakhee in Banarasi Babu (1973), with Hema Malini in Chhupa Rustam (1973) and Amir Garib (1974), with Zeenat Aman in Heera Panna (1973), Warrant (1975) Kalabaaz and Darling Darling (1977) and with Parveen Babi in Bullet (1976).The presence of his discoveries in the 1970s‚ÄîZeenat, and later Tina Munim, in films and his good on-screen chemistry with beautiful young stars such as Raakhee, Parveen Babi, Hema Malini and Zeenat Aman in various films boosted Dev's image as the evergreen star even though he was well into his fifties. He attempted different genres of films so acquired versatile hero image. He was already 55 when he was paired with Tina Munim in 1978 in Des Pardes, which became among the top five grossing films of the year. =Political activism during the Emergency in the late 1970s= Dev Anand has also been politically active. He led a group of film personalities who stood up against the Internal Emergency imposed by the then Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi. He actively campaigned against her with his supporters in Indian parliamentary elections in 1977. He also formed a party called the \\"National Party of India\\", which he later disbanded. =Later career and Evergreen Hero Image= The 1978 hit Des Pardes, directed by Dev Anand was the debut movie of actress Tina Munim and this film's success gave him the tag of the Evergreen Hero. Dev Anand was offered the lead role in Man Pasand by director Basu Chatterjee. Dev Anand's successful run at the box office continued in the 1980s with Man Pasand, Lootmaar (both opposite Tina Munim) and Swami Dada (1982), all being critically acclaimed and box office hits. Though Dev Anand's demand as the lead hero had not decreased even in the 1980s, he decided that it was the right time to introduce his son Suneil Anand in films as the hero. He launched his son in the Kramer vs. Kramer-inspired Anand Aur Anand (1984), which was produced and directed by Dev Anand himself and had music by R.D. Burman. He expected the film to do well, but the film was a box office disaster and Suneil Anand decided not to act in films any more. But films with Dev Anand as the lead hero in Hum Naujawan (1985) and Lashkar (1989) continued to be box office successes and were appreciated by critics. Awwal Number (1990), where Dev Anand co-starred with Aditya Pancholi and Aamir Khan became an average grosser in the year 1990. Aamir said in an interview that Awwal Number is the only film he signed without reading the script because it was being directed by his senior Dev Anand. Aamir quoted: \\"Dev saab was an icon for many generations and entertained us throughout his life\\". He was already 60 years old in 1983 when he acted opposite Christine O'Neil and alongside Rati Agnihotri and Padmini Kolhapure in Swami Dada. In 1989, his directorial venture Sachche ka Bolbala was released. Though critically acclaimed, it was a commercial failure. His performance as Professor Anand in the 1989 film Lashkar (film) was widely appreciated and was a major success at the box office. Lashkar was his last hit film in the lead role in 1989, with him neither being producer nor director of the film. He directed Pyar Ka Tarana in 1993, without casting himself in any role. His directorial movie Gangster (1995) had a controversial nude rape scene of an unknown actress, though the movie was released uncut. He received offers to star in lead role in outside of his home banners in films like Return of Jewel Thief and Aman Ke Farishtey but the former was not successful at the box office and the latter wasn't released in 1993 though the film was fully ready to be released. Since 1992, seven of his directorial ventures were box office failures. His films Sau Crore (1991) and Censor (2000) were critically acclaimed. His performance and direction in the 1991 film Sau Crore was appreciated as it was a movie ahead of its time dealing with real life murder of badminton star Syed Modi and the arrest being made of the wife and her ex-lover. Sau Crore remains the last commercial hit film of Dev Anand as the lead hero as well as a director. His last film Chargesheet (2011) was panned by critics across the board. He also starred in English films such as The Evil Within (1970), where he was paired opposite Vietnamese actress Kieu Chinh and Zeenat Aman and Guide (English Version). The English language film The Evil Within was a 20th-Century Fox production which couldn't get the nod from the concerned authorities due to its parallel track dealing with opium selling and thus the Indian viewers were deprived of this American venture. Of the 114 Hindi films he appeared in in 6 decades, Kahin Aur Chal (1968) had a delayed release in the early 1970s and the multi-starrer film Ek Do Teen Chaar (1980) remained unreleased and Shrimanji (1968) had him in a guest appearance. By 2011, he had the second most solo lead roles in Hindi films‚Äî 92, with Rajesh Khanna having the record for the most films as solo lead hero in Hindi films ‚Äì 106. =Comparisons with Gregory Peck= Often compared to the famous actor Gregory Peck the world over, Dev Anand said that he didn't feel ecstatic hearing the tag line bestowed on him in his heyday. \\"When you are at an impressionable age you make idols, but when you grow out of the phase, you develop your own persona. I don't want to be known as India's Gregory Peck, I am Dev Anand\\".I am not India's Gregory Peck: Dev Anand. Mid Day (14 June 2003). Retrieved on 9 November 2018. Acquainted with the Bollywood actor, Peck's personal interactions with him spanned four to five long meetings in Europe and Mumbai.Afsana Ahmed and Smrity Sharma (14 June 2003) When Gregory Peck bowled Dev Anand's girlfriend over . Times of India. Retrieved on 9 November 2018. Dev Anand and Suraiya met Peck for the first time at Bombay's Willingdon Club, after the Filmfare Awards in 1954, on Peck's stopover from a schedule at Sri Lanka after shooting for The Purple Plain. He knew of the \\"Indian Star\\" as an actor, more so probably because his romance with Suraiya was grabbing the headlines, and they had a chat. The second time they met was in Rome when Dev Anand was on his way back from the Venice Film Festival, he visited him on the set of Roman Holiday. \\"I was returning from the Venice film fest. I stopped my car and joined the crowd watching the shoot, hoping that his eyes would fall on me. As expected, he nodded and I walked up to him. He remembered me and we exchanged pleasantries.\\" The third meeting was at London on the set of Moby Dick. However, Suraiya asked for an exclusive meeting with her idol at her house. Though Anand says jealousy was natural for anyone in love, he didn't mind that he was not invited. \\"I didn't quite feel anything. It wasn't as if they were going to fall in love or make love. Even if they would have, it wouldn't have mattered. I was mature enough. Moreover, he wasn't my rival. I too was a big star by then,\\" says Anand. =Critical appraisal= Anand at the MAMI Festival Dev Anand has directed 19 films and produced 35 films. Off the 35 films he produced, 18 were commercially successful at the box office and off the 19 films directed by him 10 were hits. He wrote the stories for 13 of his films. Critics say his directorial ventures have always been ahead of their time. Dev Anand's films are well known for their hit songs. He is known to have been an active participant in the music sessions of a number of his films. His association with music composers Shankar-Jaikishen, O. P. Nayyar, Kalyanji-Anandji, Sachin Dev Burman and his son Rahul Dev Burman, lyricists Hasrat Jaipuri, Majrooh Sultanpuri, Gopaldas Neeraj, Shailendra, Anand Bakshi, and playback singers Mohammed Rafi, Hemant Kumar and Kishore Kumar produced some very popular songs. Guru Dutt, Mohammed Rafi, Pran, Dilip Kumar, Raj Kapoor, Sunil Dutt, Nargis, Kishore Kumar, S.D. Burman and R.D. Burman were his closest friends from the film industry. In September 2007, Dev's autobiography Romancing with Life was released at a birthday party with the Indian Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh. In February 2011, his 1961 black- and-white film Hum Dono was digitised, colourised and re-released. Dev Anand is credited with giving actors such as Zarina Wahab in Ishq Ishq Ishq, Jackie Shroff in Swami Dada, Tabu in Hum Naujawan and Richa Sharma (Sanjay Dutt's first wife) a break in the film industry, discovering Zeenat Amaan, Tina Munim and encouraging music composer Rajesh Roshan. Amit Khanna started his career with Navketan as executive producer in 1971 and had been secretary to Dev Anand in the 1970s. He adds, \\"The uniqueness of Navketan today is that it's the only film company in the world still run by the one who started it.\\" Shatrughan Sinha disclosed in an interview that it was Dev Anand who gave him a break in films by giving him a role in Prem Pujari and since Dev had given Sinha a very small role in that film, he compensated for it by giving Sinha another role in his next film Gambler. Sinha quoted: \\"Later on we worked together in Sharif Badmash and it was really a privilege to work with him\\".Dev Anand ruled hearts of youths for long: CM . The Times of India (4 December 2011).

Personal life  Anand had a love affair with actress Suraiya from 1948‚Äì1951, but they never married, because of opposition by Suraiya's maternal grandmother.

The area of the former lake is a large portion of the Great Basin that borders the Sacramento River watershed to the west. The lake derives its name from Louis-Armand de Lom d'Arce de Lahontan, Baron de Lahontan, a French soldier. History At its peak approximately 12,700 years ago (during a period known as the Sehoo Highstand), the lake had a surface area of over , with its largest component centered at the location of the present Carson Sink. The depth of the lake was about at present day Pyramid Lake, and at the Black Rock Desert. Lake Lahontan, during this most recent glacial period, would have been one of the largest lakes in North America. Climate change around the end of the Pleistocene epoch led to a gradual desiccation of ancient Lake Lahontan. The lake had largely disappeared in its extended form by about 9,000 years ago. As the surface elevation dropped, the lake broke up into series of smaller lakes, most of which rapidly dried up, leaving only a playa. These playas include the Black Rock Desert, the Carson Sink, and the Humboldt Sink. The only modern remnants existing as true lakes are Pyramid Lake and Walker Lake. Winnemucca Lake has been dry since the 1930s and Honey Lake periodically desiccates. The ancient shoreline is evidenced by tufa formations throughout the area. Surprisingly, the watershed feeding Lake Lahontan is not thought to have been significantly wetter during its highstand than it is currently. Rather, its desiccation is thought to be mostly due to increase in the evaporation rate as the climate warmed. Recent computer simulations (using the DSSAM ModelC.M.Hogan, Marc Papineau et al. Development of a dynamic water quality simulation model for the Truckee River, Earth Metrics Inc., Environmental Protection Agency Technology Series, Washington D.C. (1987) and other techniques) indicate, if precipitation and evaporation rates within the watershed were maintained at their historical yearly maximum and minimum, respectively, and if diversions of the Truckee River ceased, the Ice Age extent of Lake Lahontan might return. Archaeological evidence along the shore indicates the existence of the lake coincided roughly with the first appearance of humans in the region. The Lahontan cutthroat trout evolved as a predator species within the waters of Lake Lahontan, feeding on native chub and sucker. This subspecies of cutthroat trout survives today in tributary rivers of the Great Basin, and has been reintroduced to Pyramid Lake and Walker Lake after being extirpated during the 20th century.

In the night sky it is notable for its proximity to the prominent star Procyon. Nomenclature Œ≤ Canis Minoris (Latinised to Beta Canis Minoris) is the star's Bayer designation. The traditional name Gomeisa comes from the Arabic al-ghumaisa' (\\"the bleary-eyed (woman)\\"), short for ŸÖÿ±ÿ≤ŸÖ ÿßŸÑÿ∫ŸÖŸäÿµÿßÿ° mirzam al-ghumaisa' (\\"girdle of the bleary-eyed one\\"). In Arabic, the short form would be identical with the name of Procyon. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included Gomeisa for this star. In Chinese, (), meaning South River, refers to an asterism consisting of Œ≤ Canis Minoris, Procyon and Epsilon Canis Minoris. ‰∏≠ÂúãÊòüÂ∫ßÁ•ûË©±, written by Èô≥‰πÖÈáë.

Accessed on line November 23, 2010. Properties From parallax measurements, the distance to this star is about . It has an apparent visual magnitude of 2.89, making it easily visible to the naked eye. Beta Canis Minoris has about 3.5 times the Sun's mass and is rotating rapidly with a projected rotational velocity of , which gives a lower bound on the azimuthal rotational velocity along the star's equator. The actual rotation rate may be about once per day. The stellar classification of this star is B8 Ve. A luminosity class V star belongs on the main sequence, which means it is generating energy through the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen at its core. The star is radiating this energy from its outer envelope at an effective temperature of 12,050 K, giving it a blue-white hue typical of B-type stars. An 'e' classification indicates that the spectrum contains emission lines, which means this is a Be star that is surrounded by a thin, circumstellar disk made of gaseous material ejected from the star. This hot, gaseous disk is about three times the radius of the star. Variability Œ≤ Canis Minoris has long been suspected of variability, and in 1977 it was classified as a Œ≥ Cassiopeiae variable in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars. A number of studies have found no variation at all. While it shows little variation in brightness, it does display changes in the hydrogen emission coming from the gaseous disk but even those are less pronounced than in many other Be stars. Examination with the Canadian MOST space telescope reveals changes in the brightness of Œ≤ Canis Minoris at the milli-magnitude level. This variation has a cyclic pattern formed from multiple overlapping frequencies, with the dominant frequencies being 3.257 and 3.282 cycles per day. As such, it belongs to a class called slowly pulsating B-type (SPB) stars. Be stars that show these types of pulsation have been dubbed SPBe stars. Possible companion It is likely that Beta Canis Minoris is a close binary with a 170-day, eccentric orbit. The companion would have about 42% of the Sun's mass. The nature of the companion is unknown, but it is speculated that it could be a subdwarf O star remaining after binary interactions that spun up the Be primary. If confirmed, this would make it a member of the very rare Phi Persei Be+sdO type systems.

After the 1st South African Infantry Brigade Group joined in early 1916, the division was known colloquially as the Jock and Springboks. Unit history In the Battle of Loos, notable for being the first battle in which British forces used poison gas, the 9th (Scottish) Division assaulted the Hohenzollern Redoubt, the 5th Camerons suffered horrific casualties, and Corporal James Dalgleish Pollock gained a Victoria Cross for his actions. piper of the 7th (Service) Battalion, Seaforth Highlanders leads four men of the 26th Brigade back from the trenches after the attack on Longueval, France, July 1916. The 9th (Scottish) Division took part in major fighting during the Somme offensive. Notably it relieved the 30th Division at Montauban and later attacked German positions at Bernafay Wood, where it succeeded in capturing vital objectives and forcing a German withdrawal. In the Somme offensive, the 9th (Scottish) Division liberated the village of Longueval; the village now has a statue of a Scottish piper at its crossroads that commemorates this fact (see Caterpillar Valley Cemetery) and also other pipers who served in World War I.

PAW was published by Gilsoft in 1987 and quickly gained a loyal following. PAW improved over The Quill in several ways. In particular, its textual input parser was more sophisticated, meaning inputs were no longer confined to the two-word telegraphic verb noun (e.g. \\"GO WEST; TAKE LAMP\\") style. PAW also supported NPCs, different character sets, and full use of the memory of the 128K ZX Spectrum. However, unlike their prequel The Quill, the PAW no longer supported other computer systems like the BBC Micro or the Commodore 64. Over 400 games were written using PAW.Spectrum Computing: Professional Adventure Writer In 2001 WinPAW version history WinPAW was written by Douglas Harter. It could read adventures written in PAW, but ran under MS-Windows and had a few extensions to the original. The adventures made in WinPAW could only be played using the MS Windows runtime. In 2009 InPAWS was released in its first version. It allows you to extract PAW adventures, edit them or create from scratch and write back a database for PAW for either Amstrad CPC or ZX Spectrum. It thus also allows PAW adventures to be ported between the systems.InPAWS Graeme Yeandle also released an updated version of the CP/M version of PAW for MS-DOS and called it PC Adventure Writer.

It was the first of the Irish Divisions to take to the field and was the most travelled of the Irish formations.Murphy, 2007, p.11 The division served as a formation of the United Kingdom's British Army during World War I.  History  Formed in Ireland on 21 August 1914, the 10th Division was sent to Gallipoli where, as part of General Sir Frederick Stopford's IX Corps, at Suvla Bay on 7 August it participated in the Landing at Suvla Bay and the August offensive. Some battalions of the division were landed at Anzac and fought at Chunuk Bair. In September 1915, when the Suvla front became a stalemate, the division was moved to Salonika where it remained for two years and fought the Battle of Kosturino. The division moved to Egypt in September 1917 where it joined General Chetwode's XX Corps. It fought in the Third Battle of Gaza which succeeded in breaking the resistance of the Turkish defenders in southern Palestine. Heavy losses on the Western Front following Operation Michael, the great German Spring Offensive in 1918, resulted in the transfer of ten of the division's battalions from Palestine to France, their place being taken by Indian Army units. This left only one British battalion per brigade. The remainder of the division remained in Palestine until the end of the war with Turkey on 31 October 1918. On 12 November 1918 the Division concentrated at Sarafand, ready for moving back to Egypt. By 1 December it had returned to Cairo.

This has many applications, such as the proof of the Weil conjectures and the construction of representations of finite groups of Lie type. History √âtale cohomology was introduced by , using some suggestions by Jean-Pierre Serre, and was motivated by the attempt to construct a Weil cohomology theory in order to prove the Weil conjectures. The foundations were soon after worked out by Grothendieck together with Michael Artin, and published as and SGA 4. Grothendieck used √©tale cohomology to prove some of the Weil conjectures (Bernard Dwork had already managed to prove the rationality part of the conjectures in 1960 using p-adic methods), and the remaining conjecture, the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis was proved by Pierre Deligne (1974) using ‚Ñì-adic cohomology. Further contact with classical theory was found in the shape of the Grothendieck version of the Brauer group; this was applied in short order to diophantine geometry, by Yuri Manin. The burden and success of the general theory was certainly both to integrate all this information, and to prove general results such as Poincar√© duality and the Lefschetz fixed point theorem in this context. Grothendieck originally developed √©tale cohomology in an extremely general setting, working with concepts such as Grothendieck toposes and Grothendieck universes. With hindsight, much of this machinery proved unnecessary for most practical applications of the √©tale theory, and gave a simplified exposition of √©tale cohomology theory. Grothendieck's use of these universes (whose existence cannot be proved in Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel set theory) led to some speculation that √©tale cohomology and its applications (such as the proof of Fermat's last theorem) require axioms beyond ZFC. However, in practice √©tale cohomology is used mainly in the case of constructible sheaves over schemes of finite type over the integers, and this needs no deep axioms of set theory: with care the necessary objects can be constructed without using any uncountable sets, and this can be done in ZFC, and even in much weaker theories. √âtale cohomology quickly found other applications, for example Deligne and George Lusztig used it to construct representations of finite groups of Lie type; see Deligne‚ÄìLusztig theory. Motivation For complex algebraic varieties, invariants from algebraic topology such as the fundamental group and cohomology groups are very useful, and one would like to have analogues of these for varieties over other fields, such as finite fields. (One reason for this is that Weil suggested that the Weil conjectures could be proved using such a cohomology theory.) In the case of cohomology of coherent sheaves, Serre showed that one could get a satisfactory theory just by using the Zariski topology of the algebraic variety, and in the case of complex varieties this gives the same cohomology groups (for coherent sheaves) as the much finer complex topology. However, for constant sheaves such as the sheaf of integers this does not work: the cohomology groups defined using the Zariski topology are badly behaved. For example, Weil envisioned a cohomology theory for varieties over finite fields with similar power as the usual singular cohomology of topological spaces, but in fact, any constant sheaf on an irreducible variety has trivial cohomology (all higher cohomology groups vanish). The reason that the Zariski topology does not work well is that it is too coarse: it has too few open sets. There seems to be no good way to fix this by using a finer topology on a general algebraic variety. Grothendieck's key insight was to realize that there is no reason why the more general open sets should be subsets of the algebraic variety: the definition of a sheaf works perfectly well for any category, not just the category of open subsets of a space. He defined √©tale cohomology by replacing the category of open subsets of a space by the category of √©tale mappings to a space: roughly speaking, these can be thought of as open subsets of finite unbranched covers of the space. These turn out (after a lot of work) to give just enough extra open sets that one can get reasonable cohomology groups for some constant coefficients, in particular for coefficients Z/nZ when n is coprime to the characteristic of the field one is working over. Some basic intuitions of the theory are these: * The √©tale requirement is the condition that would allow one to apply the implicit function theorem if it were true in algebraic geometry (but it isn't ‚Äî implicit algebraic functions are called algebroid in older literature). * There are certain basic cases, of dimension 0 and 1, and for an abelian variety, where the answers with constant sheaves of coefficients can be predicted (via Galois cohomology and Tate modules). Definitions For any scheme X the category Et(X) is the category of all √©tale morphisms from a scheme to X. It is an analogue of the category of open subsets of a topological space, and its objects can be thought of informally as \\"√©tale open subsets\\" of X. The intersection of two open sets of a topological space corresponds to the pullback of two √©tale maps to X. There is a rather minor set-theoretical problem here, since Et(X) is a \\"large\\" category: its objects do not form a set. However, it is equivalent to a small category because √©tale morphisms are locally of finite presentation, so it is harmless to pretend that it is a small category. A presheaf on a topological space X is a contravariant functor from the category of open subsets to sets. By analogy we define an √©tale presheaf on a scheme X to be a contravariant functor from Et(X) to sets. A presheaf F on a topological space is called a sheaf if it satisfies the sheaf condition: whenever an open subset is covered by open subsets Ui, and we are given elements of F(Ui) for all i whose restrictions to Ui ‚à© Uj agree for all i, j, then they are images of a unique element of F(U). By analogy, an √©tale presheaf is called a sheaf if it satisfies the same condition (with intersections of open sets replaced by pullbacks of √©tale morphisms, and where a set of √©tale maps to U is said to cover U if the topological space underlying U is the union of their images). More generally, one can define a sheaf for any Grothendieck topology on a category in a similar way. The category of sheaves of abelian groups over a scheme has enough injective objects, so one can define right derived functors of left exact functors. The √©tale cohomology groups Hi(F) of the sheaf F of abelian groups are defined as the right derived functors of the functor of sections, :F \\\\to \\\\Gamma(F) (where the space of sections Œì(F) of F is F(X)). The sections of a sheaf can be thought of as Hom(Z, F) where Z is the sheaf that returns the integers as an abelian group. The idea of derived functor here is that the functor of sections doesn't respect exact sequences as it is not right exact; according to general principles of homological algebra there will be a sequence of functors H 0, H 1, ... that represent the 'compensations' that must be made in order to restore some measure of exactness (long exact sequences arising from short ones). The H 0 functor coincides with the section functor Œì. More generally, a morphism of schemes f : X ‚Üí Y induces a map f‚àó from √©tale sheaves over X to √©tale sheaves over Y, and its right derived functors are denoted by Rqf‚àó, for q a non-negative integer. In the special case when Y is the spectrum of an algebraically closed field (a point), Rqf‚àó(F ) is the same as Hq(F ). Suppose that X is a Noetherian scheme. An abelian √©tale sheaf F over X is called finite locally constant if it is represented by an √©tale cover of X. It is called constructible if X can be covered by a finite family of subschemes on each of which the restriction of F is finite locally constant. It is called torsion if F(U) is a torsion group for all √©tale covers U of X. Finite locally constant sheaves are constructible, and constructible sheaves are torsion. Every torsion sheaf is a filtered inductive limit of constructible sheaves.  ‚Ñì-adic cohomology groups  In applications to algebraic geometry over a finite field Fq with characteristic p, the main objective was to find a replacement for the singular cohomology groups with integer (or rational) coefficients, which are not available in the same way as for geometry of an algebraic variety over the complex number field. √âtale cohomology works fine for coefficients Z/nZ for n co-prime to p, but gives unsatisfactory results for non-torsion coefficients. To get cohomology groups without torsion from √©tale cohomology one has to take an inverse limit of √©tale cohomology groups with certain torsion coefficients; this is called ‚Ñì-adic cohomology, where ‚Ñì stands for any prime number different from p. One considers, for schemes V, the cohomology groups :H^i(V, \\\\mathbf{Z}/\\\\ell^k\\\\mathbf{Z}) and defines the ‚Ñì-adic cohomology group :H^i(V,\\\\mathbf{Z}_\\\\ell) = \\\\varprojlim H^i(V, \\\\mathbf{Z}/\\\\ell^k\\\\mathbf{Z}) as their inverse limit. Here Z‚Ñì denotes the ‚Ñì-adic integers, but the definition is by means of the system of 'constant' sheaves with the finite coefficients Z/‚ÑìkZ. (There is a notorious trap here: cohomology does not commute with taking inverse limits, and the ‚Ñì-adic cohomology group, defined as an inverse limit, is not the cohomology with coefficients in the √©tale sheaf Z‚Ñì; the latter cohomology group exists but gives the \\"wrong\\" cohomology groups.) More generally, if F is an inverse system of √©tale sheaves Fi, then the cohomology of F is defined to be the inverse limit of the cohomology of the sheaves Fi :H^q(X,F) = \\\\varprojlim H^q(X, F_i), and though there is a natural map :H^q(X,\\\\varprojlim F_i) \\\\to \\\\varprojlim H^q(X, F_i), this is not usually an isomorphism. An ‚Ñì-adic sheaf is a special sort of inverse system of √©tale sheaves Fi, where i runs through positive integers, and Fi is a module over Z/‚Ñìi Z and the map from Fi+1 to Fi is just reduction mod Z/‚Ñìi Z. When V is a non-singular algebraic curve of genus g, H1 is a free Z‚Ñì-module of rank 2g, dual to the Tate module of the Jacobian variety of V. Since the first Betti number of a Riemann surface of genus g is 2g, this is isomorphic to the usual singular cohomology with Z‚Ñì coefficients for complex algebraic curves. It also shows one reason why the condition ‚Ñì ‚â† p is required: when ‚Ñì = p the rank of the Tate module is at most g. Torsion subgroups can occur, and were applied by Michael Artin and David Mumford to geometric questions. To remove any torsion subgroup from the ‚Ñì-adic cohomology groups and get cohomology groups that are vector spaces over fields of characteristic 0 one defines :H^i(V,\\\\mathbf{Q}_\\\\ell)=H^i(V,\\\\mathbf{Z}_\\\\ell)\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{Q}_\\\\ell. This notation is misleading: the symbol Q‚Ñì on the left represents neither an √©tale sheaf nor an ‚Ñì-adic sheaf. The etale cohomology with coefficients in the constant etale sheaf Q‚Ñì does also exist but is quite different from H^i(V,\\\\mathbf{Z}_\\\\ell)\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{Q}_\\\\ell. Confusing these two groups is a common mistake. Properties In general the ‚Ñì-adic cohomology groups of a variety tend to have similar properties to the singular cohomology groups of complex varieties, except that they are modules over the ‚Ñì-adic integers (or numbers) rather than the integers (or rationals). They satisfy a form of Poincar√© duality on non-singular projective varieties, and the ‚Ñì-adic cohomology groups of a \\"reduction mod p\\" of a complex variety tend to have the same rank as the singular cohomology groups. A K√ºnneth formula also holds. For example, the first cohomology group of a complex elliptic curve is a free module of rank 2 over the integers, while the first ‚Ñì-adic cohomology group of an elliptic curve over a finite field is a free module of rank 2 over the ‚Ñì-adic integers, provided ‚Ñì is not the characteristic of the field concerned, and is dual to its Tate module. There is one way in which ‚Ñì-adic cohomology groups are better than singular cohomology groups: they tend to be acted on by Galois groups. For example, if a complex variety is defined over the rational numbers, its ‚Ñì-adic cohomology groups are acted on by the absolute Galois group of the rational numbers: they afford Galois representations. Elements of the Galois group of the rationals, other than the identity and complex conjugation, do not usually act continuously on a complex variety defined over the rationals, so do not act on the singular cohomology groups. This phenomenon of Galois representations is related to the fact that the fundamental group of a topological space acts on the singular cohomology groups, because Grothendieck showed that the Galois group can be regarded as a sort of fundamental group. (See also Grothendieck's Galois theory.) Calculation of √©tale cohomology groups for algebraic curves The main initial step in calculating √©tale cohomology groups of a variety is to calculate them for complete connected smooth algebraic curves X over algebraically closed fields k. The √©tale cohomology groups of arbitrary varieties can then be controlled using analogues of the usual machinery of algebraic topology, such as the spectral sequence of a fibration. For curves the calculation takes several steps, as follows . Let Gm denote the sheaf of non-vanishing functions. =Calculation of H1(X, Gm)= The exact sequence of √©tale sheaves :1\\\\to \\\\mathbf{G}_m\\\\to j_*\\\\mathbf{G}_{m,K}\\\\to \\\\bigoplus_{x\\\\in X}i_{x*}\\\\mathbf{Z}\\\\to 1 gives a long exact sequence of cohomology groups :\\\\begin{align} 0 &\\\\to H^0(\\\\mathbf{G}_m)\\\\to H^0(j_*\\\\mathbf{G}_{m,K})\\\\to \\\\bigoplus olimits_{x\\\\in X}H^0(i_{x*}\\\\mathbf{Z}) \\\\to \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\to H^1(\\\\mathbf{G}_m)\\\\to H^1(j_*\\\\mathbf{G}_{m,K})\\\\to \\\\bigoplus olimits_{x\\\\in X}H^1(i_{x*}\\\\mathbf{Z}) \\\\to \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\to \\\\cdots \\\\end{align} Here j is the injection of the generic point, ix is the injection of a closed point x, Gm,K is the sheaf Gm on (the generic point of X), and Zx is a copy of Z for each closed point of X. The groups H i(ix* Z) vanish if i > 0 (because ix* Z is a skyscraper sheaf) and for i = 0 they are Z so their sum is just the divisor group of X. Moreover, the first cohomology group H 1(X, j‚àóGm,K) is isomorphic to the Galois cohomology group H 1(K, K*) which vanishes by Hilbert's theorem 90. Therefore, the long exact sequence of √©tale cohomology groups gives an exact sequence :K\\\\to \\\\mathrm{Div}(X)\\\\to H^1(\\\\mathbf{G}_m)\\\\to 1 where Div(X) is the group of divisors of X and K is its function field. In particular H 1(X, Gm) is the Picard group Pic(X) (and the first cohomology groups of Gm are the same for the √©tale and Zariski topologies). This step works for varieties X of any dimension (with points replaced by codimension 1 subvarieties), not just curves. =Calculation of Hi(X, Gm)= The same long exact sequence above shows that if i ‚â• 2 then the cohomology group H i(X, Gm) is isomorphic to H i(X, j*Gm,K), which is isomorphic to the Galois cohomology group H i(K, K*). Tsen's theorem implies that the Brauer group of a function field K in one variable over an algebraically closed field vanishes. This in turn implies that all the Galois cohomology groups H i(K, K*) vanish for i ‚â• 1, so all the cohomology groups H i(X, Gm) vanish if i ‚â• 2\\\\. =Calculation of Hi(X, Œºn)= If Œºn is the sheaf of n-th roots of unity and n and the characteristic of the field k are coprime integers, then: :H^i (X, \\\\mu_n) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\mu_n(k) & i =0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathrm{Pic}_n(X) & i = 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{Z}/n\\\\mathbf{Z} & i =2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & i \\\\geqslant 3 \\\\end{cases} where Picn(X) is group of n-torsion points of Pic(X). This follows from the previous results using the long exact sequence :\\\\begin{align} 0 &\\\\to H^0(X, \\\\mu_n)\\\\to H^0(X, \\\\mathbf{G}_m)\\\\to H^0(X, \\\\mathbf{G}_m)\\\\to \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\to H^1(X, \\\\mu_n)\\\\to H^1(X, \\\\mathbf{G}_m)\\\\to H^1(X, \\\\mathbf{G}_m)\\\\to \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\to H^2(X, \\\\mu_n)\\\\to H^2(X, \\\\mathbf{G}_m)\\\\to H^2(X, \\\\mathbf{G}_m) \\\\to \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\to \\\\cdots \\\\end{align} of the Kummer exact sequence of √©tale sheaves :1 \\\\to \\\\mu_n \\\\to \\\\mathbf{G}_m \\\\xrightarrow{(\\\\cdot)^n} \\\\mathbf{G}_m \\\\to 1. and inserting the known values : H^i (X, \\\\mathbf{G}_m) = \\\\begin{cases} k^* & i = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathrm{Pic}(X) & i =1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 &i; \\\\geqslant 2 \\\\end{cases} In particular we get an exact sequence :1\\\\to H^1(X, \\\\mu_n)\\\\to \\\\mathrm{Pic}(X)\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\times n} \\\\mathrm{Pic}(X)\\\\to H^2(X, \\\\mu_n)\\\\to 1. If n is divisible by p this argument breaks down because p-th roots of unity behave strangely over fields of characteristic p. In the Zariski topology the Kummer sequence is not exact on the right, as a non-vanishing function does not usually have an n-th root locally for the Zariski topology, so this is one place where the use of the √©tale topology rather than the Zariski topology is essential. =Calculation of H i(X, Z/nZ)= By fixing a primitive n-th root of unity we can identify the group Z/nZ with the group Œºn of n-th roots of unity. The √©tale group H i(X, Z/nZ) is then a free module over the ring Z/nZ and its rank is given by: :\\\\text{rank}(H^i(X, \\\\mathbf{Z}/n\\\\mathbf{Z})) = \\\\begin{cases} 1 & i =0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2g & i=1 \\\\\\\\\\\\1 & i = 2\\\\\\\\\\\\0 & i \\\\geqslant 3 \\\\end{cases} where g is the genus of the curve X. This follows from the previous result, using the fact that the Picard group of a curve is the points of its Jacobian variety, an abelian variety of dimension g, and if n is coprime to the characteristic then the points of order dividing n in an abelian variety of dimension g over an algebraically closed field form a group isomorphic to (Z/nZ)2g. These values for the √©tale group H i(X, Z/nZ) are the same as the corresponding singular cohomology groups when X is a complex curve. =Calculation of Hi(X, Z/pZ)= It is possible to calculate √©tale cohomology groups with constant coefficients of order divisible by the characteristic in a similar way, using the Artin‚ÄìSchreier sequence :0\\\\to \\\\mathbf{Z}/p\\\\mathbf{Z}\\\\to K\\\\ \\\\xrightarrow{{}\\\\atop x\\\\mapsto x^p-x}\\\\ K\\\\to 0 instead of the Kummer sequence. (For coefficients in Z/pnZ there is a similar sequence involving Witt vectors.) The resulting cohomology groups usually have ranks less than that of the corresponding groups in characteristic 0\\\\. Examples of √©tale cohomology groups *If X is the spectrum of a field K with absolute Galois group G, then √©tale sheaves over X correspond to continuous sets (or abelian groups) acted on by the (profinite) group G, and √©tale cohomology of the sheaf is the same as the group cohomology of G, i.e. the Galois cohomology of K. *If X is a complex variety, then √©tale cohomology with finite coefficients is isomorphic to singular cohomology with finite coefficients. (This does not hold for integer coefficients.) More generally the cohomology with coefficients in any constructible sheaf is the same. *If F is a coherent sheaf (or Gm) then the √©tale cohomology of F is the same as Serre's coherent sheaf cohomology calculated with the Zariski topology (and if X is a complex variety this is the same as the sheaf cohomology calculated with the usual complex topology). *For abelian varieties and curves there is an elementary description of ‚Ñì-adic cohomology. For abelian varieties the first ‚Ñì-adic cohomology group is the dual of the Tate module, and the higher cohomology groups are given by its exterior powers. For curves the first cohomology group is the first cohomology group of its Jacobian. This explains why Weil was able to give a more elementary proof of the Weil conjectures in these two cases: in general one expects to find an elementary proof whenever there is an elementary description of the ‚Ñì-adic cohomology. Poincar√© duality and cohomology with compact support The √©tale cohomology groups with compact support of a variety X are defined to be :H_c^q(X,F) = H^q(Y, j_!F) where j is an open immersion of X into a proper variety Y and j! is the extension by 0 of the √©tale sheaf F to Y. This is independent of the immersion j. If X has dimension at most n and F is a torsion sheaf then these cohomology groups H_c^q(X,F) with compact support vanish if q > 2n, and if in addition X is affine of finite type over a separably closed field the cohomology groups H^q(X,F) vanish for q > n (for the last statement, see SGA 4, XIV, Cor.3.2). More generally if f is a separated morphism of finite type from X to S (with X and S Noetherian) then the higher direct images with compact support Rqf! are defined by :R^qf_!(F)=R^qg_*(j_!F) for any torsion sheaf F. Here j is any open immersion of X into a scheme Y with a proper morphism g to S (with f = gj), and as before the definition does not depend on the choice of j and Y. Cohomology with compact support is the special case of this with S a point. If f is a separated morphism of finite type then Rqf! takes constructible sheaves on X to constructible sheaves on S. If in addition the fibers of f have dimension at most n then Rqf! vanishes on torsion sheaves for q > 2n. If X is a complex variety then Rqf! is the same as the usual higher direct image with compact support (for the complex topology) for torsion sheaves. If X is a smooth algebraic variety of dimension N and n is coprime to the characteristic then there is a trace map :\\\\mathrm{Tr}: H_c^{2N}(X, \\\\mu_n^N) \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbf{Z}/n\\\\mathbf{Z} and the bilinear form Tr(a ‚à™ b) with values in Z/nZ identifies each of the groups :H^i_c(X,\\\\mu_n^N) and :H^{2N-i}(X,\\\\mathbf{Z}/n\\\\mathbf{Z}) with the dual of the other. This is the analogue of Poincar√© duality for √©tale cohomology. An application to curves This is how the theory could be applied to the local zeta-function of an algebraic curve. Theorem. Let be a curve of genus defined over , the finite field with elements. Then for :\\\\\\\\#X \\\\left (\\\\mathbf F_{p^n} \\\\right ) = p^n + 1 -\\\\sum_{i=1}^{2g} \\\\alpha_i^n, where are certain algebraic numbers satisfying . This agrees with being a curve of genus with points. It also shows that the number of points on any curve is rather close (within ) to that of the projective line; in particular, it generalizes Hasse's theorem on elliptic curves. =Idea of proof= According to the Lefschetz fixed point theorem, the number of fixed points of any morphism is equal to the sum :\\\\sum_{i=0}^{2 \\\\dim(X)} (-1)^i \\\\mathrm{Tr} \\\\left (f_{H^i(X)} \\\\right ). This formula is valid for ordinary topological varieties and ordinary topology, but it is wrong for most algebraic topologies. However, this formula does hold for √©tale cohomology (though this is not so simple to prove). The points of that are defined over are those fixed by , where is the Frobenius automorphism in characteristic . The √©tale cohomology Betti numbers of in dimensions 0, 1, 2 are 1, 2g, and 1 respectively. According to all of these, :\\\\\\\\#X \\\\left (\\\\mathbf F_{p^n} \\\\right ) = \\\\mathrm{Tr} \\\\left (F^n_{H^0(X)} \\\\right )- \\\\mathrm{Tr} \\\\left (F^n_{H^1(X)} \\\\right ) + \\\\mathrm{Tr} \\\\left (F^n_{H^2(X)} \\\\right ). This gives the general form of the theorem. The assertion on the absolute values of the is the 1-dimensional Riemann Hypothesis of the Weil Conjectures. The whole idea fits into the framework of motives: formally [X] = [point]+[line]+[1-part], and [1-part] has something like points.

It was named after Brigadier General Thomas Conway, whose letters criticizing Washington were forwarded to the Second Continental Congress. When these suggestions (which were often little more than criticisms and expressions of discontent with either Washington or the general course of the war) were made public, supporters of Washington mobilized to assist him politically. Conway ended up resigning from the army, and General Horatio Gates, a leading candidate to replace Washington, issued an apology for his role in events. No formal requests were ever made asking for Washington's removal as commander in chief. There was no sign of any formal conspiracy amongst the various malcontents, although Washington was concerned that there might be one. It was the only major political threat to Washington's command during the war. Background General Gates House in York, Pennsylvania where a key meeting of the cabal was reportedly held In the fall of 1777 forces of the British Army successfully captured Philadelphia, the seat of the Second Continental Congress, which was forced to relocate to York, Pennsylvania. The series of military setbacks (principally the losses at Brandywine in September and Germantown in October) caused many in the Continental Army and Congress to question George Washington's leadership of the war effort. In contrast, the northern army of General Horatio Gates had won a signal victory over John Burgoyne's forces, compelling Burgoyne to surrender his entire army after the Battles of Saratoga. Gates controversially claimed credit for the victory. Some historians feel that this was more due to the actions of Benedict Arnold, who, in the first battle on September 19, effectively and almost independently defended his forces against British assaults. It was also alleged that Gates had failed to provide Arnold with adequate reinforcements which would have turned the battle into an outright American victory, although there is not universal agreement on this matter. Gates was politically well connected to Congress. Some congressmen such as Richard Henry Lee, John Adams, and Samuel Adams wanted tighter Congressional control of the war effort and supported Gates. Although John Adams did not specifically call for Washington to be replaced, he worried that Washington was being made into a military idol, and was fearful of the effects of this upon republicanism. Military custom dictated that, after Saratoga, Gates would have sent his official report to Washington, who was his immediate superior. However, Gates sidestepped Washington and sent his report directly to Congress. Washington sent his staff officer, Colonel Alexander Hamilton, to meet Gates and tell him on Washington's behalf to send three of his brigades to Washington's troops outside Philadelphia. The logic was that Washington required more troops to fight General William Howe's British Army, which had just taken the capital, whereas Gates had no major British force to contend with. Gates desired to hold onto the brigades and suggested that another British detachment might invade. He then agreed to send only one 600-man brigade, which Hamilton discovered was the weakest of the three requested. Finally, Hamilton exacted a promise from Gates to send two brigades. At the same time, Gates wrote to Washington, rebuking him for sending Hamilton. General Horatio Gates \\"Conspiracy\\" is perhaps too strong a term to use in describing varied actions taken by disaffected officers and Congressional delegates unhappy with the course of the war. Most of those involved only shared the view that Washington was a less-than-perfect commander in chief, and very few of their activities were coordinated. General Gates was used as a stalking horse to replace Washington, and had himself also engaged in some lobbying for the command, but he was not responsible for the strong response within the Congress. Opposition to Washington's command in Pennsylvania was anchored by Thomas Mifflin, a former Congressional delegate and also a former quartermaster of the Continental Army who had previously worked closely with Washington. His view of Washington as a rank amateur was supported by Lee, Benjamin Rush, and probably others. A number of French officers who had been commissioned into the Continental Army were also critical of Washington. These notably included Johann de Kalb, Louis Leb√®gue Duportail, and Thomas Conway. Conway's letter Thomas Conway was an Irishman who was educated in France and had served in its military. Recruited by American diplomat Silas Deane, he arrived at Washington's headquarters in Morristown, New Jersey in the spring of 1777. With Washington's support, Congress made him a brigadier general in the Continental Army, and he served with some distinction under Washington during the Philadelphia campaign. His time in combat included distinguished service at Brandywine and Germantown. In October 1777, Conway began lobbying Congress for a promotion to major general, including in his writings criticisms of Washington. Washington in turn had grown to distrust Conway, finding his personal conduct arrogant and unbearable. Conway had publicly admitted that his desire for promotion was rooted in the fact that if he became a major general in the Continental Army, he could become a brigadier general once he returned to the French service. Washington opposed Conway's promotion, as he felt there were many American-born officers senior in rank to Conway and more deserving of promotion who would be upset by such a move. He identified Conway as someone \\"without conspicuous merit\\" and that his promotion would \\"give a fatal blow to the existence of the army.\\" He continued adding, \\"It will be impossible for me to be of any further service if such insuperable difficulties are thrown in my way.\\" This was seen as an implicit threat to resign. As part of Conway's efforts at self-promotion, he wrote a letter to Gates in which he was reported to have said, \\"Heaven has been determined to save your Country; or a weak General and bad Counsellors would have it.\\" Johann de Kalb (portrait by Charles Willson Peale), was also critical of Washington. General William Alexander (Lord Stirling) received a letter from Gates' adjutant, James Wilkinson, that contained this quotation. He forwarded the letter to Washington, who received it on November 8, 1777. This led Washington to consider the possibility that his subordinates were scheming behind his back to replace him. He was already aware that Gates in particular was politically well-connected and popular due to his success at Saratoga. Washington wrote Conway a brief letter: \\"Sir, a letter which I received last Night contained the following paragraph. In a letter from Genl Conway to Genl Gates he says\\", and then quotes the above passage. Conway immediately acknowledged having written to Gates, but denied having written the quoted passage. Conway also again criticized Washington in this letter, writing that \\"although your advice in council is commonly sound and proper, you have often been influenc'd by men who Were not equal to you in point of experience, Knowledge, or judgement.\\" Washington never saw the actual letter Conway sent to Gates. Henry Laurens did however, and sent Washington an excerpt: \\"What pity there is but one General Gates! but the more I see of this Army the less I think it fit for general Action under its actual Chiefs [...] I speak [to] you sincerely & wish I could serve under you.\\" General Mifflin, a man Washington also distrusted, and to whom Conway had also expressed concerns over the army's leadership, informed Gates of what had transpired. Gates wrote a letter to Washington complaining that \\"[t]hese letters have been stealingly copied\\" by persons unknown to him, and that he was sending the letter to Laurens, not Washington. This attitude did nothing to placate Washington, and his relationship with Gates deteriorated. Board of War Washington had suggested the creation of a Board of War to supply the army and requested that he be able to appoint an experienced foreign officer to serve as Inspector General. Mifflin and Lee turned the suggestion into a program which would make the Board of War into the top military authority, with the Inspector General supervising Washington and reporting directly to the Board of War. The two managed to get this plan through Congress. From Conway's letter Washington assumed that he and Mifflin were close. In mid-November, Congress decided to appoint Mifflin and Gates to the Board of War. Conway's letter of resignation was referred to the board, which rejected it. Conclusion Conway received his coveted promotion of Inspector General of the Army on December 13. Eventually, Washington revealed Wilkinson as his source for the letter. Gates was forced to apologize and lie about his correspondence with Conway. General Conway submitted his resignation to Congress in April 1778, which accepted it. Washington, still unsatisfied, urged his supporters to challenge Conway and his allies to duels. Wilkinson turned on Gates and challenged him, but Gates wept and apologized for any offense caused and the duel was called off. On July 4, Conway engaged Brigadier General John Cadwalader in a duel. Cadwalader shot him in the mouth and the bullet exited through his head. \\"I have stopped the damned rascal's lying tongue at any rate,\\" he said. As Conway suffered from his wound, he wrote an apology to Washington, which was never answered. After recovering, he returned to France. There is no evidence that any of the participants ever formally attempted to oust Washington. It was not properly a \\"cabal.\\" Rather, it was a loose network of military leaders and congressmen who lacked confidence in Washington and, in at least some cases, wanted him replaced with General Gates. After the Conway Cabal, the nation largely rallied behind Washington, who was seen more as a figure of national unity. No noticeable attempt was made to replace him for the remainder of the war.

He is considered one of the greatest English landscape painters, and a major figure of the Golden age of English watercolour. Although most popularly known for his works in watercolour, he also painted over 300 works in oil towards the end of his career, now considered \\"one of the greatest, but least recognised, achievements of any British painter.\\" His son, known as David Cox the Younger (1809-1885), was also a successful artist. Early life in Birmingham, 1783‚Äì1804 Cox's birthplace in Deritend, Birmingham, illustrated by Samuel LinesCox was born on 29 April 1783 on Heath Mill Lane in Deritend, then an industrial suburb of Birmingham. His father was a blacksmith and whitesmith about whom little is known, except that he supplied components such as bayonets and barrels to the Birmingham gun trade. Cox's mother was the daughter of a farmer and miller from Small Heath to the east of Birmingham. Early biographers record that \\"she had had a better education than his father, and was a woman of superior intelligence and force of character.\\" Cox was initially expected to follow his father into the metal trade and take over his forge, but his lack of physical strength led his family to seek opportunities for him to develop his interest in art, which is said to have first become apparent when the young Cox started painting paper kites while recovering from a broken leg. By the late 18th century Birmingham had developed a network of private academies teaching drawing and painting, established to support the needs of the town's manufacturers of luxury metal goods, but also encouraging education in fine art, and nurturing the distinctive tradition of landscape art of the Birmingham School. Cox initially enrolled in the academy of Joseph Barber in Great Charles Street, where fellow students included the artist Charles Barber and the engraver William Radclyffe, both of whom would become important lifelong friends. At the age of about 15 Cox was apprenticed to the Birmingham painter Albert Fielder, who produced portrait miniatures and paintings for the tops of snuffboxes from his workshop at 10 Parade in the northwest of the town. Early biographers of Cox record that he left his apprenticeship after Fielder's suicide, with one reporting that Cox himself discovered his master's hanging body, but this is probably a myth as Fielder is recorded at his address in Parade as late as 1825. At some time during mid-1800 Cox was given work by William Macready the elder at the Birmingham Theatre, initially as an assistant grinding colours and preparing canvases for the scene painters, but from 1801 painting scenery himself and by 1802 leading his own team of assistants and being credited in plays' publicity. London, 1804‚Äì1814 In 1804 Cox was promised work by the theatre impresario Philip Astley and moved to London, taking lodgings in 16 Bridge Row, Lambeth. Although he was unable to get employment at Astley's Amphitheatre it is likely that he had already decided to try to establish himself as a professional artist, and apart from a few private commissions for painting scenery his focus over the next few years was to be on painting and exhibiting watercolours. While living in London, Cox married his landlord's daughter, Mary Agg and the couple moved to Dulwich in 1808. David Cox Travellers on a Path, pencil and brown wash. In 1805 he made his first of many trips to Wales, with Charles Barber, his earliest dated watercolours are from this year. Throughout his lifetime he made numerous sketching tours to the Home Counties, North Wales, Yorkshire, Derbyshire and Devon. Cox exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy from 1805. His paintings never reached high prices, so he earned his living mainly as a drawing master. His first pupil, Colonel the Hon.H. Windsor (the future Earl of Plymouth) engaged him in 1808, Cox went on to acquire several other aristocratic and titled pupils. He also went on to write several books, including: Ackermanns' New Drawing Book (1809); A Series of Progressive Lessons (1811); Treatise on Landscape Painting (1813); and Progressive Lessons on Landscape (1816). The ninth and last edition of his series Progressive Lessons, was published in 1845. By 1810 he was elected President of the Associated Artists in Water Colour. In 1812, following the demise of the Associated Artists, he was elected as associate of the Society of Painters in Water Colour (the old Water Colour Society). He was elected a Member of the Society in 1813, and exhibited there every year (except 1815 and 1817) until his death. Hereford, 1814‚Äì1827 In the summer of 1813 Cox was appointed as the drawing master of the Royal Military College in Farnham, Surrey, but he resigned shortly afterwards, finding little sympathy with the atmosphere of a military institution. Soon after that he applied to a newspaper advertisement for a position as drawing master for Miss Crouchers' School for Young Ladies in Hereford and in Autumn 1814 moved to the town with his family. Cox taught at the school in Widemarsh Street until 1819, his substantial salary of ¬£100 per year requiring only two-day's work per week, allowing time for painting and the taking of private pupils. Cox's reputation as both a painter and a teacher had been building over previous years, as indicated by his election as a member of the Society of Painters in Water Colours and his inclusion in John Hassell's 1813 book Aqua Pictura, which claimed to present works by \\"all of the most approved water coloured draftsmen\\". The depression that accompanied the end of the Napoleonic Wars had caused a contraction in the art market, however, and by 1814 Cox had been very short of money, requiring a loan from one of his pupils to pay even for the move to Hereford. Despite its financial advantages and its proximity to the scenery of North Wales and the Wye Valley, the move to Hereford marked a retreat in terms of his career as a painter: he sent few works to the annual exhibition of the Society of Painters in Water Colours during his first years away from London and not until 1823 would he again contribute more than 20 pictures. Between 1823 and 1826 he had Joseph Murray Ince as a pupil.James Murray Ince, Dictionary of National Biography London, 1827‚Äì1841 He made his first trip to the Continent, to Belgium and the Netherlands in 1826 and subsequently moved to London the following year. He exhibited for the first time with the Birmingham Society of Artists in 1829, and with the Liverpool Academy in 1831. In 1839, two of Cox's watercolours were bought from the Old Water Colour Society exhibition by the Marquis of Conynha for Queen Victoria. Birmingham, 1841‚Äì1859 Greenfield House in Harborne, Birmingham ‚Äì where Cox lived from 1841 until his death in 1859 ‚Äì pictured by his son David Cox Jr.. In May 1840 Cox wrote to one of his Birmingham friends: \\"I am making preparations to sketch in oil, and also to paint, and it is my intention to spend most of my time in Birmingham for the purpose of practice\\". Cox had been considering a return to painting in oils since 1836 and in 1839 had taken lessons in oil painting from William James M√ºller, to whom he had been introduced by mutual friend George Arthur Fripp. Hostility between the Society of Painters in Water Colours and the Royal Academy made it difficult for an artist to be recognised for work in both watercolour and oil in London, however, and it is likely that Cox would have preferred to explore this new medium in the more supportive environment of his home town. By the early 1840s his income from sales of his watercolours was sufficient to allow him to abandon his work as a drawing master, and in June 1841 he moved with his wife to Greenfield House in Harborne, then a village on Birmingham's south western outskirts. It was this move that would enable the higher levels of freedom and experimentation that were to characterise his later work. The elderly Cox pictured by Samuel Bellin in 1855. In Harborne, Cox established a steady routine ‚Äì working in watercolour in the morning and oils in the afternoon. He would visit London every spring to attend the major exhibitions, followed by one or more sketching excursions, continuing the pattern that he had established in the 1830s. From 1844 these tours evolved into a yearly trip to Betws-y-Coed in North Wales to work outdoors in both oil and watercolour, gradually becoming the focus for an annual summer artists colony that continued until 1856 with Cox as its \\"presiding genius\\". Cox's experience of trying to exhibit his oils in London was short and unsuccessful: in 1842 he made his only submission to the Society of British Artists; one oil painting was exhibited at each of the British Institution and the Royal Academy in 1843; and two oil paintings were exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1844 ‚Äì the last that would be exhibited in London during his lifetime. Cox showed regularly at the Birmingham Society of Arts and its successor, the Birmingham Society of Artists, becoming a member in 1842. Cox suffered a stroke on 12 June 1853 that temporarily paralysed him, and permanently affected his eyesight, memory and coordination. By 1857 however, his eyesight had deteriorated. An exhibition of his work was arranged in 1858 by the Conversazione Society Hampstead, and in 1859 a retrospective exhibition was held at the German Gallery Bond Street, London. Cox died several months later. He was buried in the churchyard of St Peters, Harborne, Birmingham, under a chestnut tree, alongside his wife Mary. Work =Early work= In the spring of 1811 Cox made a small number of notable works in oils during a visit to Hastings with his family. It is not known why he didn't continue working in this medium at the time, but the five known surviving examples were described in 1969 as \\"surely some of the most brilliant examples of the genre in England\\". =Mature work= Cox reached artistic maturity after his move to Hereford in 1814. Although only two major watercolours can confidently be traced to the period between Cox's arrival in the town and the end of the decade, both of these ‚Äì Butcher's Row, Hereford of 1815 and Lugg Meadows, near Hereford of 1817 ‚Äì mark advances on his earlier work. =Later work= Cox's later work produced after his move to Birmingham in 1841 was marked by simplification, abstraction and a stripping down of detail. His art of the period combined the breadth and weight characteristic of the earlier English watercolour school, together with a boldness and freedom of expression comparable to later impressionism. His concern with capturing the fleeting nature of weather, atmosphere and light was similar to that of John Constable, but Cox stood apart from the older painter's focus on capturing material detail, instead employing a high degree of generalisation and a focus on overall effect. The quest for character over precision in representing nature was an established characteristic of the Birmingham School of landscape artists with which Cox had been associated early in his life, and as early as 1810 Cox's work had been criticised for its \\"sketchiness of finish\\" and \\"cloudy confusion of objects\\", which were held to betray \\"the coarseness of scene-painting\\". During the 1840s and 1850s Cox took this \\"peculiar manner\\" to new extremes, incorporating the techniques of the sketch into his finished works to a far greater degree. Cox's watercolour technique of the 1840s was sufficiently different from his earlier methods to need explanation to his son in 1842, despite the fact that his son had been helping him teach and paint since 1827. The materials used for his later works in watercolour also differed from his earlier periods: he used black chalk instead of graphite pencil as his primary drawing medium, and the rough and absorbent \\"Scotch\\" wrapping paper for which he became well-known ‚Äì both of these were related to his development of a rougher and freer style. Influence and legacy By the 1840s Cox, alongside Peter De Wint and Copley Fielding, had become recognised as one of the leading figures of the English landscape watercolour style of the first half of the 19th century. This judgement was complicated by reaction to the rougher and bolder style of Cox's later Birmingham work, which was widely ignored or condemned. While by this time De Wint and Fielding were essentially continuing in a long-established tradition, Cox was creating a new one. A group of young artists working in Cox's watercolour style emerged well before his death, including William Bennett, David Hall McKewan and Cox's son David Cox Jr.. By 1850 Bennett in particular had become recognised as \\"perhaps the most distinguished among the landscape painters\\" for his Cox-like vigorous and decisive style. Such early followers concentrated on the example of Cox's more moderate earlier work and steered clear of what were then seen as the excesses of Cox's later years. During a period dominated by sleek and detailed picturesque landscape, however, they were still condemned by publications such as The Spectator as \\"the 'blottesque' school\\", and failed to establish themselves as a cohesive movement. John Ruskin in 1857 condemned the work of the Society of Painters in Water-colours as \\"a kind of potted art, of an agreeable flavour, suppliable and taxable as a patented commodity\\", excluding only the late work of Cox, about which he wrote \\"there is not any other landscape which comes near these works of David Cox in simplicity or seriousness\\". An 1881 book, A Biography of David Cox: With Remarks on His Works and Genius, was based on a manuscript by Cox's friend William Hall, edited and expanded by John Thackray Bunce, editor of the Birmingham Daily Post. There are two Blue Plaque memorials commemorating him at 116 Greenfield Road, Harborne, Birmingham, , and at 34 Foxley Road, Kennington, London, SW9, where he lived from 1827. . It can also be seen at the David Cox exhibition in Birmingham. His pupils included Birmingham architectural artist, Allen Edward Everitt (1824‚Äì1882). A bust of Cox is in the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists' gallery. =Public collections= Several of his works are in Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery, having been donated by Joseph Henry Nettlefold, on the condition it opened on Sundays.Barbara M. D. Smith, 'Nettlefold, Joseph Henry (1827‚Äì1881)‚Äô, rev. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 His work is also held at the Louvre, British Museum, Tate Gallery, Victoria and Albert Museum, and in Manchester, Newcastle, Liverpool, Edinburgh, Oxford and Cambridge. The Lady Lever Art Gallery, Port Sunlight shows a number of Cox's watercolours bought by Lever through James Orrock. Some of them have since been confirmed as forgeries. American collections holding Cox's work include The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The National Gallery of Art, Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, Cleveland Art Museum, Fogg Art Museum, Rhode Island School of Design, High Museum of Art, Atlanta, Princeton University Art Museum, and The Huntington Library. In 1983, an exhibition celebrating the bicentenary of the artist's birth was organized by the Birmingham Museums and Art Gallery and curated by Stephen Wildman. The exhibition traveled to the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, in the same year. An exhibition of his work was held at the Yale Center for British Art in the US in 2008, traveling to Birmingham in 2009.

In a 2003 interview with Simon Hattenstone of The Guardian, Banksy is described as \\"white, 28, scruffy casual‚Äîjeans, T-shirt, a silver tooth, silver chain and silver earring. He looks like a cross between Jimmy Nail and Mike Skinner of the Streets.\\" Banksy began as an artist at the age of 14, was expelled from school, and served time in prison for petty crime.

The image of Death is based on a nineteenth-century etching illustrating the pestilence of The Great Stink. = Early career (1990‚Äì2001) = Banksy started as a freehand graffiti artist in 1990‚Äì1994 as one of Bristol's DryBreadZ Crew (DBZ), with two other artists known as Kato and Tes. He was inspired by local artists and his work was part of the larger Bristol underground scene with Nick Walker, Inkie and 3D. During this time he met Bristol photographer Steve Lazarides, who began selling Banksy's work, later becoming his agent. By 2000 he had turned to the art of stencilling after realising how much less time it took to complete a work. He claims he changed to stencilling while hiding from the police under a rubbish lorry, when he noticed the stencilled serial number and by employing this technique, he soon became more widely noticed for his art around Bristol and London. He was the goalkeeper for the Easton Cowboys and Cowgirls football team in the 1990s, and toured with the club to Mexico in 2001. Banksy's first known large wall mural was The Mild Mild West painted in 1997 to cover advertising of a former solicitors' office on Stokes Croft in Bristol. It depicts a teddy bear lobbing a Molotov cocktail at three riot police. Banksy's stencils feature striking and humorous images occasionally combined with slogans. The message is usually anti-war, anti-capitalist, or anti- establishment. Subjects often include rats, apes, policemen, soldiers, children, and the elderly. In July 2011 one of Banksy's early works, Gorilla in a Pink Mask, which had been a prominent landmark on the exterior wall of a former social club in Eastville for over ten years, was unwittingly painted over after the premises became a Muslim cultural centre. = Exhibitions (2002‚Äì2003) = On 19 July 2002, Banksy's first Los Angeles exhibition debuted at 33 Gallery, a tiny Silver Lake venue owned by Frank Sosa and was on view until 18 August. The exhibition, entitled Existencilism, \\"an Exhibition of Art, Lies and Deviousness\\" was curated by 33 Gallery, Malathion LA's Chris Vargas, Funk Lazy Promotions' Grace Jehan, and B+. The flyer of the exhibition indicates an opening reception was followed by a performance by Money Mark with DJ's Jun, AL Jackson, Rhettmatic, J.Rocc, Coleman. Some of the paintings exhibited included Smiley Copper H (2002), Leopard and Barcode (2002), Bomb Hugger (2002), and Love is in the Air (2002). In 2003, at an exhibition called Turf War, held in a London warehouse, Banksy painted on animals. At the time he gave one of his very few interviews, to the BBC's Nigel Wrench. Although the RSPCA declared the conditions suitable, an animal rights activist chained herself to the railings in protest. An example of his subverted paintings is Monet's Water Lily Pond, adapted to include urban detritus such as litter and a shopping trolley floating in its reflective waters; another is Edward Hopper's Nighthawks, redrawn to show that the characters are looking at a British football hooligan, dressed only in his Union Flag underpants, who has just thrown an object through the glass window of the cafe. These oil paintings were shown at a twelve-day exhibition in Westbourne Grove, London in 2005. Banksy, along with Shepard Fairey, Dmote, and others, created work at a warehouse exhibition in Alexandria, Sydney, for Semi-Permanent in 2003. Approximately 1,500 people attended. A stencil of Charles Manson in a prison suit, hitchhiking to anywhere, Archway, London Banksy mural in Bethlehem = ¬£10 notes to Barely Legal (2004‚Äì2006) = In August 2004, Banksy produced a quantity of spoof British ¬£10 notes replacing the picture of the Queen's head with Diana, Princess of Wales's head and changing the text \\"Bank of England\\" to \\"Banksy of England\\". Someone threw a large wad of these into a crowd at Notting Hill Carnival that year, which some recipients then tried to spend in local shops. These notes were also given with invitations to a Santa's Ghetto exhibition by Pictures on Walls. The individual notes have since been selling on eBay. A wad of the notes was also thrown over a fence and into the crowd near the NME signing tent at the Reading Festival. A limited run of 50 signed posters containing ten uncut notes was also produced and sold by Pictures on Walls for ¬£100 each to commemorate the death of Princess Diana. One of these sold in October 2007 at Bonhams auction house in London for ¬£24,000. In August 2005, Banksy, on a trip to the Palestinian territories, created nine images on the Israeli West Bank wall. Banksy held an exhibition called Barely Legal, billed as a \\"three-day vandalised warehouse extravaganza\\" in Los Angeles, on the weekend of 16 September 2006. The exhibition featured a live \\"elephant in a room\\", painted in a pink and gold floral wallpaper pattern, which, according to leaflets handed out at the exhibition, was intended to draw attention to the issue of world poverty. Although the Animal Services Department had issued a permit for the elephant, after complaints from animal rights activists, the elephant appeared unpainted on the final day. Its owners rejected claims of mistreatment and said that the elephant had done \\"many, many movies. She's used to makeup.\\" Banksy also made artwork displaying Queen Victoria as a lesbian and satirical pieces that incorporated art made by Andy Warhol and Leonardo da Vinci. West Bank barrier = Banksy effect (2006‚Äì2007) = Naked Man image by Banksy, on the wall of a sexual health clinic in Park Street, Bristol.

The six silk-screen prints, featuring the model painted in the style of Andy Warhol's Marilyn Monroe pictures, sold for five times their estimated price. Their stencil of a green Mona Lisa with real paint dripping from her eyes sold for ¬£57,600 at the same auction. In December, journalist Max Foster coined the phrase, \\"the Banksy effect\\", to illustrate how interest in other street artists was growing on the back of Banksy's success. \\"Banksy Effect\\" mentioned near end. On 21 February 2007, Sotheby's auction house in London auctioned three works, reaching the highest ever price for a Banksy work at auction: over ¬£102,000 for Bombing Middle England. Two of his other graffiti works, Girl with Balloon and Bomb Hugger, sold for ¬£37,200 and ¬£31,200 respectively, which were well above their estimated prices. The following day's auction saw a further three Banksy works reach soaring prices: Ballerina with Action Man Parts reached ¬£96,000; Glory sold for ¬£72,000; Untitled (2004) sold for ¬£33,600; all significantly above price estimates. To coincide with the second day of auctions, Banksy updated his website with a new image of an auction house scene showing people bidding on a picture that said, \\"I Can't Believe You Morons Actually Buy This Shit.\\" In February 2007, the owners of a house with a Banksy mural on the side in Bristol decided to sell the house through Red Propeller art gallery after offers fell through because the prospective buyers wanted to remove the mural. It is listed as a mural that comes with a house attached. In April 2007, Transport for London painted over Banksy's image of a scene from Quentin Tarantino's film Pulp Fiction (1994), featuring Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta clutching bananas instead of guns. Although the image was very popular, Transport for London claimed that the graffiti created \\"a general atmosphere of neglect and social decay which in turn encourages crime\\" and their staff are \\"professional cleaners not professional art critics\\". Banksy painted the same site again and, initially, the actors were portrayed as holding real guns instead of bananas, but they were adorned with banana costumes. Sometime later, Banksy made a tribute artwork over this second Pulp Fiction work. The tribute was for 19-year-old British graffiti artist Ozone who, along with fellow artist Wants, was hit by an underground train in Barking, east London on 12 January 2007. Banksy depicted an angel wearing a bullet-proof vest holding a skull. He also wrote a note on his website saying: Ozone's Angel On 27 April 2007, a new record high for the sale of Banksy's work was set with the auction of the work Space Girl and Bird fetching ¬£288,000 (US$576,000) around 20 times the estimate at Bonhams of London. On 21 May 2007 Banksy gained the award for Art's Greatest living Briton. Banksy, as expected, did not turn up to collect his award and continued with his anonymous status. On 4 June 2007, it was reported that Banksy's The Drinker had been stolen. In October 2007, most of his works offered for sale at Bonhams auction house in London sold for more than twice their reserve price.Guerilla Artist, Sky News, 24 October 2007 Banksy's Stonehenge from portable toilets at the Glastonbury Festival, June 2007 Banksy has published a \\"manifesto\\" on his website. The text of the manifesto is credited as the diary entry of British Lieutenant Colonel Mervin Willett Gonin, DSO, which is exhibited in the Imperial War Museum. It describes how a shipment of lipstick to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp immediately after its liberation at the end of World War II helped the internees regain their humanity. However, as of 18 January 2008, Banksy's Manifesto has been replaced with Graffiti Heroes No. 03, which describes Peter Chappell's graffiti quest of the 1970s that worked to free George Davis from imprisonment. By 12 August 2009 he was relying on Emo Philips' \\"When I was a kid I used to pray every night for a new bicycle. Then I realised God doesn't work that way, so I stole one and prayed for forgiveness.\\" A small number of Banksy's works can be seen in the movie Children of Men, including a stenciled image of two policemen kissing and another stencil of a child looking down a shop. Banksy, who \\"is not represented by any of the commercial galleries that sell his work second hand (including Lazarides Ltd, Andipa Gallery, Bank Robber, Dreweatts etc.)\\", claims that the exhibition at Vanina Holasek Gallery in New York City (his first major exhibition in that city) is unauthorised. The exhibition featured 62 of their paintings and prints. Banksy Swinger in New Orleans = 2008 = In March, Nathan Wellard and Maev Neal, a couple from Norfolk, UK, made headlines in Britain when they decided to sell their mobile home that contains a 30-foot mural, entitled Fragile Silence, done by Banksy a decade prior to his rise to fame. According to Nathan Wellard, Banksy had asked the couple if he could use the side of their home as a \\"large canvas\\", to which they agreed. In return for the \\"canvas\\", the Bristol stencil artist gave them two free tickets to the Glastonbury Festival. The mobile home purchased by the couple 11 years earlier for ¬£1,000, was priced at ¬£500,000. Also in March 2008, a stencilled graffiti work appeared on Thames Water tower in the middle of the Holland Park roundabout, and it was widely attributed to Banksy. It was of a child painting the tag \\"Take this‚ÄîSociety!\\" in bright orange. London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham spokesman, Councillor Greg Smith branded the art as vandalism, and ordered its immediate removal, which was carried out by H&F; council workmen within three days. In late August 2008, marking the third anniversary of Hurricane Katrina and the associated levee failure disaster, Banksy produced a series of works in New Orleans, Louisiana, mostly on buildings derelict since the disaster. Work on building in the Lower 9th Ward of New Orleans, August 2008 A stencil painting attributed to Banksy appeared at a vacant petrol station in the Ensley neighbourhood of Birmingham, Alabama on 29 August as Hurricane Gustav approached the New Orleans area. The painting, depicting a hooded member of the Ku Klux Klan hanging from a noose, was quickly covered with black spray paint and later removed altogether.Banksy's Road Trip Continues: Takes On The KKK In Birmingham, Alabama , Marc Schiller, Wooster Collective His first official exhibition in New York City, The Village Pet Store and Charcoal Grill, opened 5 October 2008. The animatronic pets in the store window include a mother hen watching over her baby Chicken McNuggets as they peck at a barbecue sauce packet, and a rabbit putting makeup on in a mirror. The Westminster City Council stated in October 2008 that the work One Nation Under CCTV, painted in April 2008 would be painted over as it was graffiti. The council said it would remove any graffiti, regardless of the reputation of its creator, and specifically stated that Banksy \\"has no more right to paint graffiti than a child\\". Robert Davis, the chairman of the council planning committee told The Times newspaper: \\"If we condone this then we might as well say that any kid with a spray can is producing art.\\" The work was painted over in April 2009. In December 2008, The Little Diver, a Banksy image of a diver in a duffle coat in Melbourne, Australia, was destroyed. The image had been protected by a sheet of clear perspex; however, silver paint was poured behind the protective sheet and later tagged with the words \\"Banksy woz ere\\". The image was almost completely obliterated.  The Cans Festival (2008)  In London, over the weekend 3‚Äì5 May 2008, Banksy hosted an exhibition called The Cans Festival. It was situated on Leake Street, a road tunnel formerly used by Eurostar underneath London Waterloo station. Graffiti artists with stencils were invited to join in and paint their own artwork, as long as it did not cover anyone else's. Banksy invited artists from around the world to exhibit their works. = 2009 = Robbo in Camden, London allegedly painted over by Banksy and subsequently painted over by Robbo in retaliation. In May 2009, Banksy parted company with agent Steve Lazarides and announced that Pest Control, the handling service who act on his behalf, would be the only point of sale for new works. On 13 June 2009, the Banksy vs Bristol Museum show opened at Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery, featuring more than 100 works of art, including animatronics and installations; it is his largest exhibition yet, featuring 78 new works. Reaction to the show was positive, with over 8,500 visitors to the show on the first weekend. Over the course of the twelve weeks, the exhibition was visited over 300,000 times. In September 2009, a Banksy work parodying the Royal Family was partially destroyed by Hackney Council after they served an enforcement notice for graffiti removal to the former address of the property owner. The mural had been commissioned for the 2003 Blur single \\"Crazy Beat\\" and the property owner, who had allowed it to be painted, was reported to have been in tears when she saw it was being painted over. In December 2009, Banksy marked the end of the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference by painting four murals on global warming. One included the phrase, \\"I don't believe in global warming;\\" the words were submerged in water.Banksy art tackles global warming . BBC News. 21 December 2009. A feud and graffiti war between Banksy and King Robbo broke out when Banksy allegedly painted over one of Robbo's tags. The feud has led to many of Banksy's works being altered by graffiti writers. = Exit Through the Gift Shop and United States (2010) = The world premiere of the film Exit Through the Gift Shop occurred at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, on 24 January. He created 10 street artworks around Park City and Salt Lake City to tie in with the screening. In February, The Whitehouse public house in Liverpool, England, was sold for ¬£114,000 at auction. The side of the building has an image of a giant rat by Banksy. In March 2010, a modified version of the work Forgive Us Our Trespassing‚Äìa kneeling boy with a spray-painted halo‚Äìwas displayed at London Bridge Station on a poster. This version of the work did not possess the halo due to its stylistic nature and the prevalence of graffiti in the underground. After a few days the halo was repainted by a graffitist, so Transport for London disposed of the poster. In April, to coincide with the premiere of Exit Through the Gift Shop in San Francisco, five of his works appeared in various parts of the city. Banksy reportedly paid a San Francisco Chinatown building owner $50 for the use of their wall for one of his stencils.Banksy in San Francisco  San Francisco Luxury Living .

In May, to coincide with the premiere of Exit Through the Gift Shop in Royal Oak, Banksy visited the Detroit area and left his mark in several places in Detroit and Warren. Shortly after, his work depicting a little boy holding a can of red paint next to the words \\"I remember when all this was trees\\" was excavated by the 555 Nonprofit Gallery and Studios. They claim that they do not intend to sell the work but plan to preserve it and display it at their Detroit gallery. There was also an attempted removal of one of the Warren works known as Diamond Girl. While in the United States, Banksy also completed a painting in Chinatown, Boston, known as Follow Your Dreams.

Exit Through the Gift Shop did not win the award, which went to Inside Job. In early March 2011, Banksy responded to the Oscars with an artwork in Weston-super-Mare, UK, of a little girl holding the Oscar and pouting.

This followed a long-running campaign by locals against the opening of a Tesco Express supermarket in Banksy's home city of Bristol. Violent clashes had taken place between police and demonstrators in the Stokes Croft area. Banksy produced the poster ostensibly to raise money for local groups in the Stokes Croft area and to raise money for the legal defense of those arrested during the riots. The posters were sold exclusively at the Bristol Anarchists Bookfair in Stokes Croft for ¬£5 each. In December, he unveiled Cardinal Sin at the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool.

On 24 September, after over a year since his previous piece, a new mural went up on his website along with the subtitle Better Out Than In.  Better Out Than In (2013)  On 1 October 2013, Banksy began a one-month \\"show on the streets of New York [City]\\", for which he opened a separate website and granted an interview to The Village Voice via his publicist. A pop-up boutique of about 25 spray-art canvases appeared on Fifth Avenue near Central Park on 12 October. Tourists were able to buy Banksy art for just $60 each. In a note posted to his website, the artist wrote: \\"Please note this was a one-off. The stall will not be there again.\\" The BBC estimated that the street-stall art pieces could be worth as much as $31,000. The booth was manned by an unknown elderly man who went about four hours before making a sale, yawning and eating lunch as people strolled by without a second glance at the work. Banksy chronicled the surprise sale in a video posted to his website noting, \\"Yesterday I set up a stall in the park selling 100% authentic original signed Banksy canvases. For $60 each.\\" Two of the canvasses sold at a July 2014 auction for $214,000. It was reported that then- New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg called Banksy a vandal whose work is not the definition of art, and that the NYPD's vandal squad was on the hunt for Banksy over his various graffiti art and installations. One creation was a fiberglass sculpture of Ronald McDonald and a real person, barefoot and in ragged clothes, shining the oversized shoes of Ronald McDonald. The sculpture was unveiled in Queens but moved outside a different McDonald's around the city every day. Other works included a YouTube video showing what appears to be footage of jihadist militants shooting down an animated Dumbo; travelling installations that toured the city including a slaughterhouse delivery truck full of stuffed animals and a waterfall; and a modified painting donated to a charity shop which was later sold in an online auction for $615,000. Banksy also posted a mock-up of a New York Times op-ed attacking the design of the One World Trade Center after the Times rejected his submission. The residency in New York concluded on 31 October 2013; many of the pieces, though, were either vandalised, removed or stolen. = 2015 =  \\"Banksy in Gaza\\" clip  In February 2015 Banksy published a 2-minute video titled Make this the year YOU discover a new destination about his trip to Gaza Strip. During the visit he painted a few artworks including a kitten on the remains of a house destroyed by an Israeli air strike. (\\"I wanted to highlight the destruction in Gaza by posting photos on my website‚Äîbut on the internet people only look at pictures of kittens\\") and a swing hanging off a watchtower. In a statement to The New York Times his publicist said, Dismaland (2015), a \\"bemusement park\\" in Weston-super-Mare  Dismaland  Banksy opened Dismaland, a large scale group show modelled on Disneyland on 21 August 2015. It lampooned the many disappointing temporary themed attractions in the UK at the time. Dismaland permanently closed on 27 September 2015. The \\"theme park\\" was located in Weston-super-Mare, United Kingdom. According to the Dismaland website, artists represented on the show include Damien Hirst and Jenny Holzer.  The Son of a Migrant from Syria  In December 2015, Banksy created several murals in the vicinity of Calais, France, including the so- called \\"Jungle\\" where migrants live as they attempt to enter the United Kingdom. One of the pieces, The Son of a Migrant from Syria, depicts Steve Jobs as a migrant. = 2017 =  Walled Off Hotel  In 2017, marking the 100th anniversary of the British control of Palestine, Banksy financed the creation of the Walled Off Hotel in Bethlehem.

It also houses a contemporary art gallery. = 2018 =  Return to New York  2018 saw Banksy return to New York five years after his Better Out Than In residency. A trademark rat running around the circumference of a clock-face, dubbed Rat race, was torn down by developers within a week of it appearing on a former bank building at 101 West 14th Street, but other works, including a mural of imprisoned Kurdish artist Zehra Doƒüan on the famed Bowery Wall and a series of others across Brooklyn, remain on display. Balloon Girl Shredding In October 2018, one of Banksy's works, Balloon Girl, was sold in an auction at Sotheby's in London for ¬£1.04m. However, shortly after the gavel dropped and it was sold, an alarm sounded inside of the picture frame and the canvas passed through a shredder hidden within the frame, partially shredding the picture. Banksy then posted an image of the shredding on Instagram captioned \\"Going, going, gone...\\". After the sale, the auction house acknowledged that the self- destruction of the work was a prank by the artist. The prank received wide news coverage around the world, with one newspaper stating that it was \\"quite possibly the biggest prank in art history.\\" Joey Syer, co-founder of an online platform facilitating art dealer sales, told the Evening Standard: \\"The auction result will only propel this further and given the media attention this stunt has received, the lucky buyer would see a great return on the ¬£1.02M they paid last night, this is now part of art history in its shredded state and we'd estimate Banksy has added at a minimum 50% to its value, possibly as high as being worth ¬£2m+.\\" A man seen filming the shredding of the picture during its auction has been suggested to be Banksy. Banksy has since released a video on how the shredder was installed into the frame and the shredding of the picture, explaining that he had surreptitiously fitted the painting with the shredder a few years previously, in case it ever went up for auction. To explain his rationale for destroying his own artwork, Banksy quoted Picasso: \\"The urge to destroy is also a creative urge\\". (Although Banksy cited Picasso, this quote is usually attributed to Mikhail Bakunin.) It is not known how the shredder was activated. Banksy has released another video indicating that the painting was intended to be shredded completely. The video shows a sample painting completely shredded by the frame and says: \\"In rehearsals it worked every time...\\".Banksy, Shredding the Girl and Balloon ‚Äì The Director's half cut, 17 October 2018 The woman who won the bidding at the auction decided to go through with the purchase. The partially shredded work has been given a new title, Love is in the Bin, and it was authenticated by Banksy's authentication body Pest Control. Sotheby released a statement that said \\"Banksy didn't destroy an artwork in the auction, he created one,\\" and called it \\"the first artwork in history to have been created live during an auction.\\"  Season's Greetings  Season's Greetings was created by Banksy in Port Talbot, Wales, in December 2018, and was quickly provided with a temporary protective covering to prevent vandalism. A two-sided graffiti piece, one side depicting a child tasting the falling snow, the other revealing that the snow is in fact smoke and embers from a fire, appeared on two walls of a steelworker's garage in Port Talbot in December. Banksy then revealed that the painting was in fact his via an Instagram video soundtracked by the festive children's song 'Little Snowflake'. Many fans of the artist went to see the painting and Plaid Cymru councillor for Aberavon, Nigel Thomas Hunt, stated that the town was \\"buzzing\\" with speculation that the work was Banksy's. The owner of the garage, Ian Lewis, said that he had lost sleep over fears that the image would be vandalised. A plastic screen, partially funded by Michael Sheen, was installed to protect the mural, but was attacked by a \\"drunk halfwit\\". Extra security guards were subsequently drafted to protect the graffiti piece. In May 2019, the mural was moved to a gallery in the town's Ty'r Orsaf building. = 2019 =  Trademark dispute  In early October 2019, Banksy opened a \\"pop-up shop\\" named Gross Domestic Product in Croydon, South London in order to strengthen his position in a trademark dispute with a greetings cards company who had challenged his trademark on the grounds that he was not using it. In a statement, Banksy said \\"A greetings cards company is contesting the trademark I hold to my art, and attempting to take custody of my name so they can sell their fake Banksy merchandise legally.\\" Mark Stephens, arts lawyer and founder of the Design and Artists Copyright Society, called the case a \\"ludicrous litigation\\" and is providing the artist legal advice. Stephens recommended opening the shop to Banksy on the grounds that it would show he is making use of his trademark, saying: \\"Because [Banksy] doesn‚Äôt produce his own range of shoddy merchandise and the law is quite clear‚Äîif the trademark holder is not using the mark, then it can be transferred to someone who will.\\" On 4 October 2019, greetings cards distributor Full Colour Black publicly revealed itself as the company involved in the trademark dispute whilst rejecting Banksy's claims as \\"entirely untrue\\". The company claimed it had contacted Banksy's lawyers several times to offer to pay royalties. Record sale for Devolved Parliament In October 2019, Devolved Parliament, a 2009 painting by Banksy showing Members of Parliament depicted as chimpanzees in the House of Commons, sold at Sotheby's in London for just under ¬£9.9 million. On Instagram, the artist said it was a \\"record price for a Banksy painting\\" and \\"shame I didn't still own it\\". At wide it is Banksy's biggest known work on canvas. The auction house stated: \\"Regardless of where you sit in the Brexit debate, there's no doubt that this work is more pertinent now than it has ever been.\\" = 2020 =  Valentine's Day  On 13 February 2020, the Valentine‚Äôs Banksy mural appeared on the side of a building in Bristol's Barton Hill neighbourhood, depicting a young girl firing a slingshot of real red flowers and leaves. In the early hours of Valentine's Day (14 February), Banksy confirmed this was his work on his Instagram account and website. The painting was defaced just days after appearing. He dedicated a painting to healthcare workers and donated it to the University Hospital of Southampton during the global coronavirus pandemic in May 2020. Cultural icon There exists a cult-like following for the artist. The ambiguity of his identity has drawn this group of followers. A concept, the \\"Banksy effect\\" has developed as a result of Banksy's artistic innovation. This term is in reference to the artist's ability to turn outsider art into the cultural mainstream. It was coined to reference the way in which Banksy's work has led to an increased interest in street art. Street art has been incorporated into being a part of culture and daily life. His work in turn has questioned the authenticity of art and its creators, furthering the cultural debate that has existed for centuries. In January 2011, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary for Exit Through the Gift Shop. In 2014, he was awarded Person of the Year at the 2014 Webby Awards. In 2014, young adults from abroad named Banksy a British cultural icon in a list that included William Shakespeare, Queen Elizabeth II, David Beckham, The Beatles, Charlie Chaplin, J. K. Rowling, Elton John, and Adele.  Other notable artworks  Banksy has claimed responsibility for a number of high-profile artworks, including the following: * At London Zoo, he climbed into the penguin enclosure and painted \\"We're bored of fish\\" in letters. * At London Zoo, he left the message \\"I want out. This place is too cold. Keeper smells. Boring, boring, boring.\\" in the elephant enclosure. * In 2004, he placed the piece Banksus Militus Ratus into London's Natural History Museum. * In March 2005, he placed subverted artworks in the Museum of Modern Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art, and American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan as well as the Brooklyn Museum in Brooklyn. * In May 2005 Banksy's version of a primitive cave painting depicting a human figure hunting wildlife while pushing a shopping trolley was hung in gallery 49 of the British Museum, London. * In August 2005, Banksy painted nine images on the Israeli West Bank barrier, including an image of a ladder going up and over the wall and an image of children digging a hole through the wall. * In October 2005, Banksy designed six station IDs for Nickelodeon. * In April 2006, Banksy created a sculpture based on a crumpled red phone box with a pickaxe in its side, apparently bleeding, and placed it in a side street in Soho, London. It was later removed by Westminster Council.\\" * In June 2006, Banksy created Well Hung Lover, an image of a naked man hanging out of a bedroom window on a wall visible from Park Street in central Bristol. The image sparked \\"a heated debate\\",Banksy's Bristol: Home Sweet Home by Steve Wright (2007), p. 93 with the Bristol City Council leaving it up to the public to decide whether it should stay or go. After an internet discussion in which 97% of the 500 people surveyed supported the stencil, the city council decided it would be left on the building. The mural was later defaced with blue paint. * In August/September 2006, Banksy placed up to 500 copies of Paris Hilton's debut CD, Paris, in 48 different UK record stores with his own cover art and remixes by Danger Mouse. Music tracks were given titles such as \\"Why Am I Famous?\\", \\"What Have I Done?\\" and \\"What Am I For?\\". Several copies of the CD were purchased by the public before stores were able to remove them, some going on to be sold for as much as ¬£750 on online auction websites such as eBay. The cover art depicted Hilton digitally altered to appear topless. Other pictures feature her with her chihuahua Tinkerbell's head replacing her own, and one of her stepping out of a luxury car, edited to include a group of homeless people, which included the caption \\"90% of success is just showing up.\\" * In September 2006, Banksy dressed an inflatable doll in the manner of a Guantanamo Bay detainment camp prisoner (orange jumpsuit, black hood, and handcuffs) and then placed the figure within the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad ride at the Disneyland theme park in Anaheim, California. * He makes stickers (the Neighbourhood Watch subvert) and was responsible for the cover art of Blur's 2003 album Think Tank. * In September 2007, Banksy covered a wall in Portobello Road with a French artist painting graffiti of Banksy's name. * In July 2012, in the run up to the London 2012 Olympic games he created several pieces based upon this event. One included an image of an athlete throwing a missile instead of a javelin, evidently taking a poke at the surface to air missile sites positioned in the Stratford area to defend the games. * In April 2014, he created a piece in Cheltenham, near the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) headquarters, which depicts three men wearing sunglasses and using listening devices to \\"snoop\\" on a telephone box, evidently criticising the recent Global surveillance disclosures of 2013. This was only confirmed by Banksy as his work later in June 2014. This piece 'disappeared' on 20 August 2016 during renovations to the building it was on, and may have been destroyed. * In June 2016, a 14 ft painting of a child with a stick chasing a burning tyre was found in the Bridge Farm Primary School in Bristol with a letter from Banksy thanking the school for naming one of its houses after him. BBC News reported that a spokesman for Banksy confirmed that the artwork was genuine. In the letter, Banksy wrote that if the members of the school did not like the painting, they should add their own elements. * In May 2017, Banksy claimed the authorship of a giant Brexit mural, painted on a house in Dover (Kent) * Banksy's Dream Boat, originally made for the Dismaland exhibition, was donated to Help Refugees to help raise funds for the charity. The artwork was displayed in Help Refugees' London Choose Love pop-up shop in the run-up to Christmas 2018, and members of the public could pay ¬£2.00 to enter a competition to guess the weight of the piece.

In 2008, in Melbourne, paint was poured over a stencil of an old-fashioned diver wearing a trench coat. In April 2010, the Melbourne City Council reported that they had inadvertently ordered private contractors to paint over a rat descending in a parachute adorning the wall of an old council building behind the Forum Theatre. Many works that make up the Better Out Than In series in New York City have been defaced, some just hours after the piece was unveiled. At least one defacement was identified as done by a competing artist, OMAR NYC, who spray-painted over Banksy's red mylar balloon piece in Red Hook. OMAR NYC also defaced some of Banksy's work in May 2010.  Technique  ATM attacking a girl, Rosebery Avenue, London, January 2008 Because of the secretive nature of Banksy's work and identity, it is uncertain what techniques he uses to generate the images in the stencils, though it is assumed he uses computers for some images due to the photographic quality of much of his work. He mentions in his book Wall and Piece that as he was starting to do graffiti, he was always either caught or could never finish the art in one sitting. He claims he changed to stencilling while hiding from the police under a rubbish lorry, when he noticed the stencilled serial number. He then devised a series of intricate stencils to minimise time and overlapping of the colour. There exists a debate about the influence behind his work. Some critics claim Banksy was influenced by musician and graffiti artist 3D. Another source credits the artist's work to resemble that of French graffiti artist Blek le Rat. It is said that Banksy was inspired by their use of stencils, later taking this visual style and transforming it through modern political and social pieces. Banksy's stencils feature striking and humorous images occasionally combined with slogans. The message is usually anti-war, anti-capitalist or anti-establishment. Subjects often include rats, apes, policemen, soldiers, children, and the elderly. In the broader art world, stencils are traditionally hand drawn or printed onto sheets of acetate or card, before being cut out by hand. This technique allows artists to paint quickly to protect their anonymity. There is dispute in the street art world over the legitimacy of stencils, with many artists criticising their use as \\"cheating\\". In 2018, Banksy created a piece live, as it was being auctioned. The piece, titled, Love is in the Bin, was originally the painting, Girl with Balloon, before it was shredded at Sotheby's. While the bidding was going on, a shredder was activated from within the frame, and the piece was partially shredded, thus creating a new piece.  Political and social themes  Shop Until You Drop in Mayfair, London. Banksy has said \\"We can't do anything to change the world until capitalism crumbles. In the meantime we should all go shopping to console ourselves.\\"Wall and Piece, by Banksy, 2006, Century, , p. 204 Banksy once characterised graffiti as a form of underclass \\"revenge\\", or guerrilla warfare that allows an individual to snatch away power, territory and glory from a bigger and better equipped enemy. Banksy sees a social class component to this struggle, remarking \\"If you don't own a train company then you go and paint on one instead.\\" Banksy's work has also shown a desire to mock centralised power, hoping that their work will show the public that although power does exist and works against you, that power is not terribly efficient and it can and should be deceived. Banksy's works have dealt with various political and social themes, including anti-war, anti-consumerism, anti-fascism, anti-imperialism, anti-authoritarianism, anarchism, nihilism, and existentialism. Additionally, the components of the human condition that his works commonly critique are greed, poverty, hypocrisy, boredom, despair, absurdity, and alienation. Although Banksy's works usually rely on visual imagery and iconography to put forth their message, Banksy has made several politically related comments in various books. In summarising his list of \\"people who should be shot\\", he listed \\"Fascist thugs, religious fundamentalists, (and) people who write lists telling you who should be shot.\\"Wall and Piece, by Banksy, 2006, Century, , p. 110 While facetiously describing his political nature, Banksy declared that \\"Sometimes I feel so sick at the state of the world, I can't even finish my second apple pie.\\"Wall and Piece, by Banksy, 2006, Century, , p. 155 During the 2017 United Kingdom general election, Banksy offered voters a free print if they cast a ballot against the Conservative candidates standing in the Bristol North West, Bristol West, North Somerset, Thornbury, Kingswood and Filton constituencies. According to a note posted on Banksy's website, an emailed photo of a completed ballot paper showing it marked for a candidate other than the Conservative candidate would result in the voter being mailed a limited edition piece of Banksy art. On 5 June 2017 the Avon and Somerset Constabulary announced it had opened an investigation into Banksy for the suspected corrupt practice of bribery, and the following day Banksy withdrew the offer stating \\"I have been warned by the Electoral Commission that the free print offer will invalidate the election result. So I regret to announce that this ill- conceived and legally dubious promotion has now been cancelled.\\" During the COVID-19 pandemic, Banksy referenced medical advice to self-isolate by creating an artwork in his bathroom. Philanthropy and activism Banksy has donated a number of works to promote various causes, such as Civilian Drone Strike, which was sold in 2017 at ¬£205,000 to raise funds for Campaign Against Arms Trade and Reprieve. It was part of the exhibition 'Art the Arms Fair' set up in opposition to the DSEI arms fair. In 2018, a sculpture titled Dream Boat, which was exhibited in Dismaland in 2015, was raffled off in aid of Help Refugees for a minimum donation of ¬£2 for every guesses of its weight in a pop-up Choose Love shop in Carnaby Street. In 2002, he produced artwork for the Greenpeace campaign Save or Delete. He also provided works to support local causes; in 2013, a work titled The Banality of the Banality of Evil was sold for an undisclosed amount after a failed auction to support an anti- homelessness charity in New York, In 2014, an artwork on a doorway titled Mobile Lovers was sold ¬£403,000 to keep a youth club in Bristol open, and he created merchandise for homeless charities in Bristol in 2019. Banksy has been producing a number of works and projects in support of the Palestinians since the mid-2000s, including The Walled Off Hotel in Bethlehem. In July 2020, Banksy sold three paintings forming a triptych titled Mediterranean Sea View 2017, which raised ¬£2.2 million for a hospital in Bethlehem. The paintings were original created for The Walled Off Hotel, and are Romantic-era paintings of the seashore that have been modified with images of lifebuoys and orange life jackets washed up on the shore, a reference to the European migrant crisis. Banksy gifted a painting titled Game Changer to a hospital in May 2020 as a tribute to National Health Service workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. In August 2020, it was revealed that Banksy had privately funded a rescue boat to save refugees at risk in the Mediterranean Sea. The former French Navy boat, renamed after Louise Michel, has been painted pink with an image of a young girl holding a heart-shaped safety float.  Criticism  Peter Gibson, a spokesman for Keep Britain Tidy, asserts that Banksy's work is simple vandalism. Another official for the same organisation stated: \\"We are concerned that Banksy's street art glorifies what is essentially vandalism.\\" In his column for The Guardian, satirist Charlie Brooker wrote of Banksy, \\"...his work looks dazzlingly clever to idiots.\\" Banksy has also been long criticised for copying the work of Blek le Rat, who created the life-sized stencil technique in early 1980s Paris and used it to express a similar combination of political commentary and humorous imagery. Blek has praised Banksy for his contribution to urban art, but said in an interview for the documentary Graffiti Wars that some of Banksy's more derivative work makes him \\"angry\\", saying that \\"It's difficult to find a technique and style in art so when you have a style and you see someone else is taking it and reproducing it, you don't like that.\\" Some have criticised the \\"obviousness\\" of Banksy's work and accused it of being \\"anarchy-lite\\" geared towards a middle class \\"hipster\\" audience. Much of this criticism came forward during his series of works in New York in 2013. Many New York street artists, such as TrustoCorp, criticised Banksy, and much of his work was defaced.  Books  Banksy has published several books that contain photographs of his work accompanied by his own writings: * Banging Your Head Against a Brick Wall (2001) * Existencilism (2002) * Cut It Out (2004) * Pictures of Walls (2005) * Wall and Piece (2007) Banging Your Head Against a Brick Wall, Existencilism, and Cut It Out were a three-part self-published series of small booklets.Publisher: Weapons of Mass Distraction, Open Library, Retrieved 24 October 2018 Pictures of Walls is a compilation book of pictures of the work of other graffiti artists, curated and self-published by Banksy. None of them are still in print, or were ever printed in any significant number.Pictures of Walls, Amazon, Retrieved 24 October 2018 Banksy's Wall and Piece compiled large parts of the images and writings in their original three book series, with heavy editing and some new material. It was intended for mass print, and published by Random House. The writings in their original three books had numerous grammatical errors, and his writings in them often took a dark, and angry, and a self-described paranoid tone. While the content in them was almost entirely kept in Wall and Piece, the stories were edited and generally took a less provocative tone, and the grammatical errors were resolved (presumably to make it suitable for mass market distribution).

Although Aylesbury has grown to such an extent that it completely surrounds Walton by a couple of miles in each direction, the hamlet is still marked on modern maps. Walton sits north of the junction between two major turnpike roads, and was once the location of a toll gate and the toll keeper's cottage. It has also, in its time, been the location of a foundlings hospital and a leper colony. History The hamlet name is a common one in England. It is Anglo Saxon in origin and either means Walled Settlement or Settlement of the Walhs, the word 'walh' being an Old English word for Briton. There is evidence that there has been a settlement in Walton since the Roman occupation of England where remains of a Romano-British villa have been found. There were also known to be Saxon houses in the vicinity of Walton in the 5th century. The manor house in Walton was called Walton Court, and was a wattle and daub structure that was stockaded and moated and situated across the road of what is now Walton Terrace. It was throughout most of its history owned by the Church, and revenue from the manor went to Lincoln Cathedral (it was mentioned in a charter to the cathedral by King William II). It was owned privately for a brief period in the mid 17th century but was subsequently returned to the Church following the restoration of the monarchy in 1660. The principal crop of the manorial farm was rushing used in thatching. The manor should not to be confused with Walton Court, the modern housing estate of the same name, which is in a completely different location. Towards the middle of the 19th century Walton became the local centre for breeding the Aylesbury duck with Walton Pond being a congregating point for many of the local flocks. Holy Trinity Church, Walton The stone- built Holy Trinity Church in Walton opened in 1845 to provide a local place of worship for the farm labourers who lived in the hamlet, and canal workers from the newly built 1814 Aylesbury arm of the Grand Union canal. A hall was built in 1859 next door to the church to start what was to become Walton Holy Trinity National School (now Walton Hall) to support and educate local children. Walton Hall has always been both independent from and also supported by members of Holy Trinity and has been a focus of local community life from its beginnings in 1859. In the Second World War Walton was the landing site of the only bomb to be dropped on Aylesbury by enemy aircraft. The 15-pound bomb destroyed the medieval Walton Grange and severely damaged most of the other houses in Walton.Vaughan, Karl (2002) A Century of Aylesbury. Swindon: WHSmith Walton Grange's garden wall still remains though the property now forms part of Aylesbury High School. A terrace of housing in Walton Modern Walton Today the hamlet keeps a strong identity in the town, with the roads of Walton Street, Walton Road, Walton Grove, Walton Way, Walton Dene and Walton Green all being in the vicinity of the hamlet, and other landmarks such as the Georgian Walton Lodge and the old village pond (Bigg's pond) still remaining. The hamlet is also the location of Aylesbury's Police Station, Driving Test Centre and Aylesbury Grammar School, as well as the aforementioned High School. Walton Street showing Walton lodge on the far left and the Bricklayers Arms, centre right. There are four pubs in the vicinity, The Aristocrat, The Bricklayers Arms, The Broad Leys and The Millwrights. There is currently an Indian Restaurant called Shensha on Stoke Road which was formerly a fifth public house, The Old Plough and Harrow (previously the Whistling Duck and before that The Plough and Harrow). There was also a public house just outside the area to the south called The Three Pigeons, which was demolished to make way for housing. It was at this public house that the two turnpike roads met originally, before the northern one was rerouted. ESRI UK offices, Walton William Harding's Charity William Harding (1643 ‚Äì 1718) was a yeoman from the hamlet of Walton who left a trust in his will to clothe and educate the children of the poor from the local area.Biography of William Harding The charity was founded after the will was proved in 1719 with the aim of: * Providing forty shillings a year to buy coats for the poor men and women of Walton * To select children of poor parents in Aylesbury and Walton to be given apprenticeships * To clothe those same children The charity still exists today and is managed by the trustees the clerk of which is a partner of Parrott and Coales LLPParrott and Coales LLP Solicitors in Aylesbury.

Early life Born in Montreal, Tremblay received a Queen Elizabeth II Scholarship to attend Tufts University in the United States, where she earned a Master's degree in pre-school education. She then completed a certificate in educational studies at the Universit√© de Lyon and a certificate in child care studies at the University of London.

Their rituals and regalia are modeled after those assumed by white men of the era to be used by Native Americans. Despite the name, the order was formed solely by, and for, white men. The organization claimed a membership of about half a million in 1935, but has declined to a little more than 15,000.  History  On December 16, 1773, a group of white colonists ‚Äî all men, and members of the Sons of Liberty ‚Äî met in Boston to protest the tax on tea imposed by England. When their protest went unheeded, they disguised themselves as their idea of Mohawk people, proceeded to Boston harbor, and dumped overboard 342 chests of English tea. (See Boston Tea Party.) In the late 18th century, the Tammany Societies, named after Tamanend, were formed. The most well-known of these was New York City's Society of St. Tammany, which grew into a major political machine known as \\"Tammany Hall.\\" For the next 35 years, the original Sons of Liberty and the Sons of St. Tamina groups went their own way, under many different names. Around 1813, a disenchanted group created the philanthropic \\"Society of Red Men\\" at historic Fort Mifflin in Philadelphia. Founding dates of fraternal organizations The organization grew in the 1820s. Parallel lines of advancement were offered in the Order of Red Men: a series of military titles and a set of Indian rankings. Class and ethnic differences introduced by new immigrants, anti-Masonic persecutions, attacks on fraternal groups based on excessive drinking, and, ultimately, a wide-spread cholera epidemic in 1832 led to the decline of the organization. In 1834, the Improved Order of Red Men (IORM) was started as a revival in Baltimore. Founding dates of fraternal organizations It was focused on temperance, patriotism and American History. In 1835, with only two tribes in place, a larger IORM was organized. Unlike the original Order, the IORM uses only expanded Indian titles. Rather than the public display of Indian costumes, the IORM uses its regalia in private gatherings. In 1886, its membership requirements were defined in the same pseudo-Indian phrasing as the rest of the constitution: In one 1886 tribe, a member's 12 cent a week dues went into a fund which was used to pay disability benefits to members at a rate of about \\"three fathoms per seven suns\\" ($3/week) for up to \\"six moons\\" (6 months) and then two dollars a week. Some medical care (\\"a suitable nurse\\") was available, and also a death benefit of one hundred dollars. The fund was invested in bonds, mortgages, and \\"Building Association Stock\\". Meetings were held weekly on Friday nights.  Organization  The Order has a three tiered structure. Local units are called \\"Tribes\\" and are presided over by a \\"Sachem\\" and a board of directors. Local meeting sites are called \\"Wigwams\\". The state level is called the \\"Reservation\\" and governed by a \\"Great Sachem\\" and \\"Great Council\\" or \\"Board of Chiefs\\". The national level is the \\"Great Council of the United States\\". The Great Council consists of the \\"Great Incohonee\\" (president), and a \\"Board of Great Chiefs\\", which includes the \\"Great Senior Sagamore\\" (first vice-president), \\"Great Junior Sagamore\\", \\"Great Chief of Records\\" (secretary), \\"Great Keeper of the Wampum\\" and \\"Prophet\\" (past president). The headquarters of the Order has been in Waco, Texas, since at least 1979. They maintain an official museum and library in Waco. = Auxiliaries and side degrees = A side degree of the order was founded in 1890 as the National Haymakers' Association.Alan Axelrod International Encyclopedia of Secret Societies and Fraternal Orders New York; Facts on File, inc 1997 p.114 There was also once a uniformed division called the Knights of Tammany, as well as a group called the Chieftains League, which consisted of members who had been exalted to the Chief Degree (see below) and were in good standing within their respective Tribes.Schmidt p.288 In 1952, the Order created the Degree of Hiawatha, as a youth auxiliary for males 8 and up. Most of the members of the Degree of Hiawatha were concentrated in New England. In 1979 there were less than 5,000 members in approximately 125 \\"Councils\\".Schmidt pp.157, 288 The Order female auxiliary is the Degree of Pocahontas and dates to the 1880s and the Degree of Anona, a junior order of the Degree of Pocahontas, was formed in 1952.Schmidt pp.43,260 Pocahontas Degree  Membership  The Improved Order of the Red Men grew in membership in the late 19th century. It reached 519,942 members in forty-six states in 1921, but had declined to 31,789 in 32 states in 1978Schmidt p.287 and to 15,251 by 2011.\\"Great Council of U.S. Improved Order of Red Men\\" entry, Associations Unlimited database, Gale Research Co., 2011, cited at Until 1974, the Order was open to whites only. That year the 106th Great Council of the United States eliminated the all-white clause in what was called a \\"turning point for the order\\".  Rituals  The order itself claims direct descent from the Sons of Liberty, noting that the Sons participated in the Boston Tea Party dressed as their idea of \\"Indians\\". Thus, they continue to dress as \\"Indians\\" and use Native American terminology, despite being a non- Native organization. The group's ritual terminology is derived from language they believe is used by Native Americans, though it also shows the influence of Freemasonry. Outsiders are called \\"Palefaces\\", to open a meeting is called \\"kindling the fire\\", officers' installations are called \\"Raising up of Chiefs\\" and voting is called \\"twigging\\". The Masonic influence is seen in the three basic degrees ‚Äì Adoption, Warrior and Chief. There is also a fourth degree, Beneficiary, for insurance.Schmidt pp.287-8 =Calendar system= Originally, the society used the Hebrew Anno Mundi system for calendar year numbering when dating their documents, rather than the Common Era; however, in CE 1865, a new system was devised and adopted, known as the \\"Great Sun of Discovery\\" (GSD). The first year of the system, known as GSD 1, was the year that Christopher Columbus arrived in the Americas, namely CE 1492.Lindsay, George W (1893), Official History of the Improved Order of Red Men , Reprint, London: Forgotten Books, 2013. (pp. 494-5) In this system, years were known as \\"great suns\\" and months were called \\"moons\\", each with their own epithet, e.g. \\"Cold Moon\\" for January, but the length of these years and months conformed to the conventional Gregorian calendar.Mencken, Henry Louis (1945), The American Language: Supplement I-II, Alfred A Knopf, New York (p. 185)  Philanthropy and positions  The order has historically opposed federal welfare programs, waste in government and Communism. However, there are examples of substantial socialist participation in the organization in pockets of the United States; for example, in southern West Virginia, during the build up to the West Virginia Mine Wars, \\"the Improved Order of Red Men [was] . . . the most comfortable lodge for Socialist miners and other radical workers.\\" (http://www.wvculture.org/history/wvhs/wvhs1701.html) The IORM supported the founding of the Society of American Indians in 1911 and helped organize the SAI's first two conferences.Todd Leahy and Raymond Wilson Historical Dictionary of Native American Movements Lanham, Md.: Scarecrow Press p.75  Offshoots  = Independent Order of Red Men = In 1850, the German-language Metamora Tribe of Baltimore refused to pay a benefit, even though the Great Councils of Maryland and the United States decided that it was legal and proper for them to do so. The group then surrendered its charter and formed a new, German-speaking Independent Order of Red Men. It asked the other German- language groups (or Stamms) to join the new group, but few did so. The Independent Order had a height of 12,000 members, though in the 1880s many Stamms returned to the Improved Order.Stevens, Albert C. Cyclopedia of Fraternities: A Compilation of Existing Authentic Information and the Results of Original Investigation as to the Origin, Derivation, Founders, Development, Aims, Emblems, Character, and Personnel of More Than Six Hundred Secret Societies in the United States. E. B. Treat and Company, New York p.262 It still existed in 1896, but according to Albert C. Stevens it gave \\"no sign of vigorous growth\\".Stevens p.262 In the early 1920s, Arthur Preuss could not get into contact with them, but felt it probably still existed.Preuss, Arthur, A Dictionary of Secret and other Societies. St. Louis: B. Herder Book Co. 1924 p.192 = Afro-American Order of Red Men = In 1904, another group called the Independent Order of Red Men emerged in Virginia, this time composed entirely of African Americans. When the Improved Order objected to the use of the name, the leader of the group, R. M. Spears, had the charter withdrawn and renamed the group the \\"Afro-American Order of Red Men and Daughters of Pocahontas\\". The Virginia IORM still apparently considered an injunction against the new group, but it is unclear how the episode turned out.Theda Skocpol; Ariane Liazos; Marshall Ganz What a mighty power we can be: African American fraternal groups and the struggle for racial equality Princeton : Princeton University Press, 2006 pp.44-5 A Tribe #23 based in Metompkin, Virginia is attested by the existence of a ribbon badge in the collection of Theda Skocpol, suggesting that the group had at least 23 local Tribes in the state.

The term has traditionally referred to terrestrial environments, though growing attention is being placed on marine wilderness. Recent maps of wilderness suggest it covers roughly one quarter of Earth's terrestrial surface, but is being rapidly degraded by human activity. Even less wilderness remains in the ocean, with only 13.2% free from intense human activity. Some governments establish protection for wilderness areas by law to not only preserve what already exists, but also to promote and advance a natural expression and development. These can be set up in preserves, conservation preserves, national forests, national parks and even in urban areas along rivers, gulches or otherwise undeveloped areas. Often these areas are considered important for the survival of certain species, biodiversity, ecological studies, conservation, solitude and recreation.No Man's Garden by Daniel B. Botkin p155-157 They may also preserve historic genetic traits and provide habitat for wild flora and fauna that may be difficult to recreate in zoos, arboretums or laboratories. History Innoko Wilderness, Alaska United States in the summer. =Ancient times and Middle Ages= Looked at through the lens of the visual arts, nature and wildness have been important subjects in various epochs of world history. An early tradition of landscape art occurred in the Tang Dynasty (618-907). The tradition of representing nature as it is became one of the aims of Chinese painting and was a significant influence in Asian art. Artists in the tradition of Shan shui (lit. mountain-water-picture), learned to depict mountains and rivers \\"from the perspective of nature as a whole and on the basis of their understanding of the laws of nature‚Ä¶ as if seen through the eyes of a bird.\\" In the 13th century, Shih Erh Chi recommended avoiding painting \\"scenes lacking any places made inaccessible by nature.\\"Chinese brush painting Asia-art.net Retrieved on: 20 May 2006. For most of human history, the greater part of the Earth's terrain was wilderness, and human attention was concentrated on settled areas. The first known laws to protect parts of nature date back to the Babylonian Empire and Chinese Empire. Ashoka, the Great Mauryan King, defined the first laws in the world to protect flora and fauna in Edicts of Ashoka around 3rd Century B.C. In the Middle Ages, the Kings of England initiated one of the world's first conscious efforts to protect natural areas. They were motivated by a desire to be able to hunt wild animals in private hunting preserves rather than a desire to protect wilderness. Nevertheless, in order to have animals to hunt they would have to protect wildlife from subsistence hunting and the land from villagers gathering firewood. Similar measures were introduced in other European countries. =19th century to present= The idea of wilderness having intrinsic value emerged in the Western world in the 19th century. British artists John Constable and J. M. W. Turner turned their attention to capturing the beauty of the natural world in their paintings. Prior to that, paintings had been primarily of religious scenes or of human beings. William Wordsworth's poetry described the wonder of the natural world, which had formerly been viewed as a threatening place. Increasingly the valuing of nature became an aspect of Western culture.History of Conservation BC Spaces for Nature. Retrieved: 20 May 2006. By the mid-19th century, in Germany, \\"Scientific Conservation,\\" as it was called, advocated \\"the efficient utilization of natural resources through the application of science and technology.\\" Concepts of forest management based on the German approach were applied in other parts of the world, but with varying degrees of success.Akamani, K. (nd). \\"The Wilderness Idea: A Critical Review.\\" A Better Earth.org. Retrieved: 1 June 2006 Over the course of the 19th century wilderness became viewed not as a place to fear but a place to enjoy and protect, hence came the conservation movement in the latter half of the 19th century. Rivers were rafted and mountains were climbed solely for the sake of recreation, not to determine their geographical context. In 1861, following an intense lobbying by artists (painters), the French Waters and Forests Military Agency set an ¬´ artistic reserve ¬ª in Fontainebleau State Forest. With a total of 1 097 hectares, it is known to be the first World nature reserve. Global conservation became an issue at the time of the dissolution of the British Empire in Africa in the late 1940s. The British established great wildlife preserves there. As before, this interest in conservation had an economic motive: in this case, big game hunting. Nevertheless, this led to growing recognition in the 1950s and the early 1960s of the need to protect large spaces for wildlife conservation worldwide. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF), founded in 1961, grew to be one of the largest conservation organizations in the world. Early conservationists advocated the creation of a legal mechanism by which boundaries could be set on human activities in order to preserve natural and unique lands for the enjoyment and use of future generations. This profound shift in wilderness thought reached a pinnacle in the US with the passage of the Wilderness Act of 1964, which allowed for parts of U.S. National Forests to be designated as \\"wilderness preserves\\". Similar acts, such as the 1975 Eastern Wilderness Areas Act, followed. Nevertheless, initiatives for wilderness conservation continue to increase. There are a growing number of projects to protect tropical rainforests through conservation initiatives. There are also large-scale projects to conserve wilderness regions, such as Canada's Boreal Forest Conservation Framework. The Framework calls for conservation of 50 percent of the 6,000,000 square kilometres of boreal forest in Canada's north.Canadian Boreal Initiative Boreal Forest Conservation Framework . www.borealcanada.ca Retrieved on: 1 December 2007. In addition to the World Wildlife Fund, organizations such as the Wildlife Conservation Society, the WILD Foundation, The Nature Conservancy, Conservation International, The Wilderness Society (United States) and many others are active in such conservation efforts. The 21st century has seen another slight shift in wilderness thought and theory. It is now understood that simply drawing lines around a piece of land and declaring it a wilderness does not necessarily make it a wilderness. All landscapes are intricately connected and what happens outside a wilderness certainly affects what happens inside it. For example, air pollution from Los Angeles and the California Central Valley affects Kern Canyon and Sequoia National Park. The national park has miles of \\"wilderness\\" but the air is filled with pollution from the valley. This gives rise to the paradox of what a wilderness really is; a key issue in 21st century wilderness thought. A view of wilderness in Estonia National parks El Toro Wilderness within the Caribbean National Forest in Puerto Rico The creation of National Parks, beginning in the 19th century, preserved some especially attractive and notable areas, but the pursuits of commerce, lifestyle, and recreation combined with increases in human population have continued to result in human modification of relatively untouched areas. Such human activity often negatively impacts native flora and fauna. As such, to better protect critical habitats and preserve low-impact recreational opportunities, legal concepts of \\"wilderness\\" were established in many countries, beginning with the United States (see below). The first National Park was Yellowstone, which was signed into law by U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant on 1 March 1872.Mangan, E. Yellowstone, the First National Park Library of Congress, Mapping the National Parks. Retrieved on: 2010-08-12. The Act of Dedication declared Yellowstone a land \\"hereby reserved and withdrawn from settlement, occupancy, or sale under the laws of the United States, and dedicated and set apart as a public park or pleasuring ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people.\\" The world's second national park, the Royal National Park, located just 32 km to the south of Sydney, Australia, was established in 1879.New South Wales National Parks & Wildlife Service, \\"Parks & Reserves: Royal National Park\\" . Accessed 6 December 2011. The U.S. concept of national parks soon caught on in Canada, which created Banff National Park in 1885, at the same time as the transcontinental Canadian Pacific Railway was being built. The creation of this and other parks showed a growing appreciation of wild nature, but also an economic reality. The railways wanted to entice people to travel west. Parks such as Banff and Yellowstone gained favor as the railroads advertised travel to \\"the great wild spaces\\" of North America. When outdoorsman Teddy Roosevelt became president of the United States, he began to enlarge the U.S. National Parks system, and established the National Forest system. By the 1920s, travel across North America by train to experience the \\"wilderness\\" (often viewing it only through windows) had become very popular. This led to the commercialization of some of Canada's National Parks with the building of great hotels such as the Banff Springs Hotel and Chateau Lake Louise. Despite their similar name, national parks in England and Wales are quite different from national parks in many other countries. Unlike most other countries, in England and Wales, designation as a national park may include substantial settlements and human land uses which are often integral parts of the landscape, and land within a national park remains largely in private ownership. Each park is operated by its own national park authority. Conservation and preservation in 20th century United States By the later 19th century it had become clear that in many countries wild areas had either disappeared or were in danger of disappearing. This realization gave rise to the conservation movement in the United States, partly through the efforts of writers and activists such as John Burroughs, Aldo Leopold, and John Muir, and politicians such as U.S. President Teddy Roosevelt. Cook Lake in the Bridger Wilderness, Bridger-Teton National Forest, Wyoming, U.S. The idea of protecting nature for nature's sake began to gain more recognition in the 1930s with American writers like Aldo Leopold, calling for a \\"land ethic\\" and urging wilderness protection. It had become increasingly clear that wild spaces were disappearing rapidly and that decisive action was needed to save them. Wilderness preservation is central to deep ecology; a philosophy that believes in an inherent worth of all living beings, regardless of their instrumental utility to human needs. Two different groups had emerged within the US environmental movement by the early 20th century: the conservationists and the preservationists. The initial consensus among conservationists was split into \\"utilitarian conservationists\\" later to be referred to as conservationists, and \\"aesthetic conservationists\\" or preservationists. The main representative for the former was Gifford Pinchot, first Chief of the United States Forest Service, and they focused on the proper use of nature, whereas the preservationists sought the protection of nature from use. Put another way, conservation sought to regulate human use while preservation sought to eliminate human impact altogether. The management of US public lands during the years 1960s and 70s reflected these dual visions, with conservationists dominating the Forest Service, and preservationists the Park Service Formal wilderness designations = International = The World Conservation Union (IUCN) classifies wilderness at two levels, 1a (Strict Nature Preserves) and 1b (Wilderness areas). There have been recent calls for the World Heritage Convention to better protect wilderness and to include the word wilderness in their selection criteria for Natural Heritage Sites Forty-eight countries have wilderness areas established via legislative designation as IUCN protected area management Category 1b sites that do not overlap with any other IUCN designation. They are: Australia, Austria, Bahamas, Bangladesh, Bermuda, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Canada, Cayman Islands, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cuba, Czech Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Estonia, Finland, French Guyana, Greenland, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Japan, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Marshall Islands, Mexico, Mongolia, Nepal, New Zealand, Norway, Northern Mariana Islands, Portugal, Seychelles, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Tanzania, United States of America, and Zimbabwe. At publication, there are 2,992 marine and terrestrial wilderness areas registered with the IUCN as solely Category 1b sites. Twenty-two other countries have wilderness areas. These wilderness areas are established via administrative designation or wilderness zones within protected areas. Whereas the above listing contains countries with wilderness exclusively designated as Category 1b sites, some of the below- listed countries contain protected areas with multiple management categories including Category 1b. They are: Argentina, Bhutan, Brazil, Chile, Honduras, Germany, Italy, Kenya, Malaysia, Namibia, Nepal, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, Philippines, the Russian Federation, South Africa, Switzerland, Uganda, Ukraine, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Venezuela, and Zambia. = Germany = The German National Strategy on Biological Diversity aims to establish wilderness areas on 2% of its terrestrial territory by 2020 (7,140 km2). However, protected wilderness areas in Germany currently only cover 0.6% of the total terrestrial area. In absence of pristine landscapes, Germany counts national parks (IUCN Category II) as wilderness areas. Professionally incorrect, the government counts the whole area of the 16 national parks as wilderness. This means, also the managed parts are included in the \\"existing\\" 0,6%. There is no doubt, that Germany will miss its own time-dependent quantitative goals, but there are also some critics, that point a bad designation practice: Findings of disturbance ecology, according to which process-based nature conservation and the 2% target could be further qualified by more targeted area designation, pre- treatment and introduction of megaherbivores, are widely neglected. Since 2019 the government supports bargains of land that will then be designated as wilderness by 10 Mio. Euro annually. The German minimum size for wilderness candidate sites is normally 10 km2. In some cases (i.e. swamps) the minimum size is 5 km2. =France= Since 1861, the French Waters and Forests Military Agency (Administration des Eaux et For√™ts) put a strong protection on what was called the ¬´ artistic reserve ¬ª in Fontainebleau State Forest. With a total of 1,097 hectares, it is known to be the first World nature reserve. Then in the 1950s,1995 & 1998 National Forests Office internal instructions in application of the last paragraph of article L. 212-2 of the French Forest Act Integral Biological Reserves (R√©serves Biologiques Int√©grales, RBI) are dedicated to man free ecosystem evolution, on the contrary of Managed Biological reserves (R√©serves Biologiques Dirig√©es, RBD) where a specific management is applied to conserve vulnerable species or threatened habitats. Integral Biological Reserves occurs in French State Forests or City Forests and are therefore managed by the National Forests Office. In such reserves, all harvests coupe are forbidden excepted exotic species elimination or track safety works to avoid fallen tree risk to visitors (already existing tracks in or on the edge of the reserve). At the end of 2014,http://www.onf.fr/onf/sommaire/developpement_durable/actions/20080707-150833-949463/@@index.html there were 60 Integral Biological Reserves in French State Forests for a total area of 111,082 hectares and 10 in City Forests for a total of 2,835 hectares. =Greece= In Greece there are some parks called \\"ethniki drimoi\\" (ŒµŒ∏ŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒøŒØ Œ¥œÅœÖŒºŒøŒØ, national forests) that are under protection of the Greek government. Such parks include: Olympus, Parnassos and Parnitha National Parks. =Russia= Due to Russia's size and in comparison non-dense population settlement, as well as of lack of infrastructure and the decades-long iron curtain the country is considered as one of the least explored areas and most natural places in the world. =New Zealand= There are seven wilderness areas in New Zealand as defined by the National Parks Act 1980 and the Conservation Act 1987 that fall well within the IUCN definition. Wilderness areas cannot have any human intervention and can only have indigenous species re-introduced into the area if it is compatible with conservation management strategies. In New Zealand wilderness areas are remote blocks of land that have high natural character. The Conservation Act 1987 prevents any access by vehicles and livestock, the construction of tracks and buildings, and all indigenous natural resources are protected. They are generally over 400 km2 in size. =United States= The Great Swamp of New Jersey, donated for federal protection by concerned residents, was designated as the first wilderness refuge in the United States - winter scene photographed in March, 2008 In the United States, a Wilderness Area is an area of federal land set aside by an act of Congress. It is typically at least 5,000 acres (about 8 mi2 or 20 km2) in size.United States National Park Service - Wilderness - Fort Pulaski National Monument https://www.nps.gov/fopu/learn/nature/wilderness.htm Human activities in wilderness areas are restricted to scientific study and non- mechanized recreation; horses are permitted but mechanized vehicles and equipment, such as cars and bicycles, are not. The United States was one the first countries to officially designate land as \\"wilderness\\" through the Wilderness Act of 1964. The Wilderness Act was‚Äîand is still‚Äîan important part of wilderness designation because it created the legal definition of wilderness and founded the National Wilderness Preservation System. The Wilderness Act defines wilderness as \\"an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammelled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain.\\" Wilderness designation helps preserve the natural state of the land and protects flora and fauna by prohibiting development and providing for non-mechanized recreation only. The first administratively protected wilderness area in the United States was the Gila National Forest. In 1922, Aldo Leopold, then a ranking member of the U.S. Forest Service, proposed a new management strategy for the Gila National Forest. His proposal was adopted in 1924, and 750 thousand acres of the Gila National Forest became the Gila Wilderness. 'The Great Swamp in New Jersey was the first formally designated wilderness refuge in the United States. It was declared a wildlife refuge on 3 November 1960. In 1966 it was declared a National Natural Landmark and, in 1968, it was given wilderness status. Properties in the swamp had been acquired by a small group of residents of the area, who donated the assembled properties to the federal government as a park for perpetual protection.

While wilderness designations were originally granted by an Act of Congress for Federal land that retained a \\"primeval character\\", meaning that it had not suffered from human habitation or development, the Eastern Wilderness Act of 1975 extended the protection of the NWPS to areas in the eastern States that were not initially considered for inclusion in the Wilderness Act. This act allowed lands that did not meet the constraints of size, roadlessness, or human impact to be designated as wilderness areas under the belief that they could be returned to a \\"primeval\\" state through preservation.\\"The Wilderness Act of 1964\\".

A wilderness area is gazetted under section 62(1)(a) of the Conservation and Land Management Act 1984 by the Minister on any land that is vested in the Conservation Commission of Western Australia. International Movement Monument Valley in Utah, United States At the forefront of the international wilderness movement has been The WILD Foundation, its founder Ian Player and its network of sister and partner organizations around the globe. The pioneer World Wilderness Congress in 1977 introduced the wilderness concept as an issue of international importance, and began the process of defining the term in biological and social contexts. Today, this work is continued by many international groups who still look to the World Wilderness Congress as the international venue for wilderness and to The WILD Foundation network for wilderness tools and action. The WILD Foundation also publishes the standard references for wilderness professionals and others involved in the issues: Wilderness Management: Stewardship and Protection of Resources and Values, the International Journal of Wilderness, A Handbook on International Wilderness Law and Policy and Protecting Wild Nature on Native Lands are the backbone of information and management tools for international wilderness issues. The Wilderness Specialist Group within the World Commission on Protected Areas (WTF/WCPA) of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) plays a critical role in defining legal and management guidelines for wilderness at the international level and is also a clearing-house for information on wilderness issues. The IUCN Protected Areas Classification System defines wilderness as \\"A large area of unmodified or slightly modified land, and/or sea retaining its natural character and influence, without permanent or significant habitation, which is protected and managed so as to preserve its natural condition (Category 1b).\\" The WILD Foundation founded the WTF/WCPA in 2002 and remains co-chair. Extent The Ahklun Mountains and the Togiak Wilderness within the Togiak National Wildlife Refuge in the U.S. state of Alaska The most recent efforts to map wilderness show that less than one quarter (~23%) of the world's wilderness area now remains, and that there have been catastrophic declines in wilderness extent over the last two decades. Over 3 million square kilometers (10 percent) of wilderness was converted to human land-uses. The Amazon and Congo rain forests suffered the most loss. Human pressure is starting to extend into almost every corner of the planet. The loss of wilderness could have serious implications for biodiversity conservation. A previous study, Wilderness: Earth's Last Wild Places, carried out by Conservation International, 46% of the world's land mass is wilderness. For purposes of this report, \\"wilderness\\" was defined as an area that \\"has 70% or more of its original vegetation intact, covers at least and must have fewer than five people per square kilometer.\\"Conservation International (2002) Global Analysis Finds Nearly Half The Earth Is Still Wilderness. Retrieved on 06 Nov 2017. However, an IUCN/UNEP report published in 2003, found that only 10.9% of the world's land mass is currently a Category 1 Protected Area, that is, either a strict nature reserve (5.5%) or protected wilderness (5.4%).Chape, S., S.

PDF Such areas remain relatively untouched by humans. Of course, there are large tracts of lands in National Parks and other protected areas that would also qualify as wilderness. However, many protected areas have some degree of human modification or activity, so a definitive estimate of true wilderness is difficult. The Wildlife Conservation Society generated a human footprint using a number of indicators, the absence of which indicate wildness: human population density, human access via roads and rivers, human infrastructure for agriculture and settlements and the presence of industrial power (lights visible from space). The society estimates that 26% of the Earth's land mass falls into the category of \\"Last of the wild.\\" The wildest regions of the world include the Arctic Tundra, the Siberia Taiga, the Amazonia Rainforest, the Tibetan Plateau, the Australia Outback and deserts such as the Sahara, and the Gobi.Wildlife Conservation Society. 2005.

However, from the 1970s, numerous geoglyphs have been discovered on deforested land in the Amazon rainforest, leading to claims about Pre- Columbian civilizations. The BBC's Unnatural Histories claimed that the Amazon rainforest, rather than being a pristine wilderness, has been shaped by man for at least 11,000 years through practices such as forest gardening and terra preta. The percentage of land area designated \\"wilderness\\" does not necessarily reflect a measure of its biodiversity.

Critique Cedar Mountain Wilderness in northern Utah, United States. The American concept of wilderness has been criticized by some nature writers. For example, William Cronon writes that what he calls a wilderness ethic or cult may \\"teach us to be dismissive or even contemptuous of such humble places and experiences\\", and that \\"wilderness tends to privilege some parts of nature at the expense of others\\", using as an example \\"the mighty canyon more inspiring than the humble marsh.\\"The Trouble with Wilderness University of Wisconsin-Madison. Retrieved: 28 January 2007. This is most clearly visible with the fact that nearly all U.S. National Parks preserve spectacular canyons and mountains, and it was not until the 1940s that a swamp became a national park‚Äîthe Everglades. In the mid-20th century national parks started to protect biodiversity, not simply attractive scenery. Cronon also believes the passion to save wilderness \\"poses a serious threat to responsible environmentalism\\" and writes that it allows people to \\"give ourselves permission to evade responsibility for the lives we actually lead....to the extent that we live in an urban-industrial civilization but at the same time pretend to ourselves that our real home is in the wilderness\\". Michael Pollan has argued that the wilderness ethic leads people to dismiss areas whose wildness is less than absolute. In his book Second Nature, Pollan writes that \\"once a landscape is no longer 'virgin' it is typically written off as fallen, lost to nature, irredeemable.\\"Pollan, Michael (2003). Second Nature: A Gardener's Education, p. 188. Grove Press. . Another challenge to the conventional notion of wilderness comes from Robert Winkler in his book, Going Wild: Adventures with Birds in the Suburban Wilderness. \\"On walks in the unpeopled parts of the suburbs,\\" Winkler writes, \\"I‚Äôve witnessed the same wild creatures, struggles for survival, and natural beauty that we associate with true wilderness.\\"Winkler, Robert. (2003). Going Wild: Adventures with Birds in the Suburban Wilderness. National Geographic . Attempts have been made, as in the Pennsylvania Scenic Rivers Act, to distinguish \\"wild\\" from various levels of human influence: in the Act, \\"wild rivers\\" are \\"not impounded\\", \\"usually not accessible except by trail\\", and their watersheds and shorelines are \\"essentially primitive\\".Pennsylvania Scenic Rivers Act (P.L. 1277, Act No. 283 as amended by Act 110, May 7, 1982) Another source of criticism is that the criteria for wilderness designation is vague and open to interpretation. For example, the Wilderness Act states that wilderness must be roadless. The definition given for roadless is \\"the absences of roads which have been improved and maintained by mechanical means to insure relatively regular and continuous use.\\" However, there have been added sub-definitions that have, in essence, made this standard unclear and open to interpretation. Coming from a different direction, some criticism from the Deep Ecology movement argues against conflating \\"wilderness\\" with \\"wilderness reservations\\", viewing the latter term as an oxymoron that, by allowing the law as a human construct to define nature, unavoidably voids the very freedom and independence of human control that defines wilderness. True wilderness requires the ability of life to undergo speciation with as little interference from humanity as possible. Anthropologist and scholar on wilderness Layla Abdel-Rahim argues that it is necessary to understand the principles that govern the economies of mutual aid and diversification in wilderness from a non-anthropocentric perspective.

Category:Global natural environment ","title":"Wilderness"},{"id":"396282","text":"Beat Street is a 1984 American drama dance film featuring New York City hip hop culture of the early 1980s, breakdancing, DJing, and graffiti. Plot Set in the South Bronx, the film follows the lives of a pair of brothers and their group of friends, all of whom are devoted to various elements of early hip hop culture. Kenny Kirkland (Guy Davis) is a budding disc jockey and Master of Ceremonies, and his younger brother, Lee (Robert Taylor), is a hardcore b-boy who dances with Beat Street Breakers (the New York City Breakers). Kenny's best friends are Ramon (Jon Chardiet), a graffiti artist known by his tag, \\"Ramo\\", and Chollie (Leon W. Grant), his self-styled manager/promoter. The film begins with the main characters preparing for a house party set in an abandoned apartment building, where Kenny is the featured DJ. An uninvited Lee and his breakdancing friends crash the party, and nearly get tangled into a battle with a rival troupe, the Bronx Rockers (the Rock Steady Crew). The battle of mostly words is broken up by Henri (Dean Elliot), a squatter who lives in the building and is befriended by Kenny, Chollie, Ramon and Luis (Franc. Reyes). Kenny has dreams of performing in New York City's top nightclubs. No club is bigger than the Roxy, and on one visit he crosses paths with Tracy Carlson (Rae Dawn Chong), a college music student and composer. A breakdance battle between the Breakers and Rock Steady ensues and Tracy admires Lee's performance. She then invites him to audition for a television show focusing on dancing. Lee, Kenny and their crew arrive during a dance rehearsal, and Lee gives his performance only to find out he won't be on television. Protecting his brother's interests, Kenny rips into Tracy for leading Lee on; Ramon steals a videotape of Lee's dance as the crew walk out. A remorseful Tracy then shows up at the Kirkland home to apologize. Lee was not home but Kenny was, working on a mix tape. Tracy clarifies her story, saying that she did not promise to Lee that he was going to be on the TV show. She then takes an interest in Kenny's mixing and the two find common ground. Kenny and Tracy then head into the subway, where they meet up with Lee, Ramon and Luis spray painting an abandoned station platform. They pack up and leave when they hear noises, thinking it may be the police; it turned out to be a rogue graffiti artist known as Spit who defaces Ramo's work (and the work of other artists) by spraying his tag over it. As the group take the train back uptown, Kenny and Tracy break away and spend the rest of the evening together, striking up a romance while walking and talking. Chollie talks Kenny into a guest spot at the Burning Spear, a club run by DJ Kool Herc. Kenny not only spins but presents a special Christmas-themed skit performed by the Treacherous Three, Doug E. Fresh and the Magnificent Force. The crowd's positive reaction convinces Kool Herc to invite Kenny back. But both Kenny and Chollie see the regular gig as a stepping stone to their bigger goal. They return to the Roxy, where auditions are being held for new talent. Chollie convinces Kenny to let him do the talking, and waits for the auditions to end before he succeeds in getting the talent scout to check out Kenny at the Burning Spear. The scout keeps his word, and is impressed enough that he offers Kenny a performance on New Year's Eve. Tracy offers to help Kenny out by allowing him to work on a computer keyboard system at her studio. However, Kenny accidentally presses a wrong button and deletes his work. Stubborn and frustrated, Kenny leaves the studio, saying he had enough material for New Year's Eve. Meanwhile, Ramon is feeling pressure from two sources. His father, Domingo (Shawn Elliot), who despises his graffiti, wants him to find honest work, while his girlfriend Carmen (Saundra Santiago), the mother of his son, longs for them to be together as a family. Ramon eventually gets a job in a hardware store, and he then takes Carmen and their baby to live with him in Henri's building. But Ramon does not stop thinking of the subway trains that are his canvas. When he sees a white painted one pass him by, he vows to put his mark on it. Later that evening, Ramon and Kenny find the train and proceed to paint one side of the lead car. As they work on the second side of the car, Ramon hears noises, and they discover the rogue graffiti artist, Spit, defacing the completed side. Ramon and Kenny chase Spit through the tunnel and into a station, and a fight ensues. Spit sprays paint in Ramon's eye, and both men tussle on the roadbed before they roll onto the electrified third rail, which kills them instantly. As the group mourn the death of their friend, Kenny considers not performing for the New Year's Eve show at the Roxy. However, with the help of Tracy and despite initial reluctance from Chollie, Kenny turns his big break into a celebration of Ramon's life. The show is the film's grand finale starting with a rap performance by Kenny while images of Ramon and his work were shown on a screen in the background. Kenny is followed by Grandmaster Melle Mel & the Furious Five and a Bronx gospel choir, and backed by dancers and breakdancers.

However, his scenes were all cut from the final theatrical version. Background Some of the plot line was based on the New York City graffiti documentary, Style Wars. Most visibly, the antagonist, Spit, in Beat Street was lifted from the real-life graffiti artist CAP MPC, who was portrayed in Style Wars. It was screened out of competition at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival. Filming locations Beat Street was filmed in New York City in 1983, in the boroughs of The Bronx, Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens. Several scenes were shot inside the city's subway system, both onboard trains and in stations, notably Hoyt-Schermerhorn Streets, 57th Street-Sixth Avenue and Fresh Pond Road. Scenes were also filmed on the campus of the City College of New York, which includes the concert venue Aaron Davis Hall. Many of the internal dance sequences were filmed at the popular night club, the Roxy, located in the Chelsea section of Manhattan. Musical performances and soundtrack There are several performances in the movie, notably from established early hip hop groups, Grandmaster Melle Mel & the Furious Five, Doug E. Fresh, Afrika Bambaataa & Soulsonic Force and the Treacherous Three. As a member of the Treacherous Three, Kool Moe Dee also appeared in the film. The musical performance of Kool Moe Dee stands as one of the few media appearances he has ever made without his trademark sunglasses (a style he had not yet adopted at the time). In addition to these acts, Guy Davis, who played Kenny, is also a blues musician in real life. Three female MCs appear in a party scene in Beat Street‚ÄîDebbie D, Sha-Rock and Lisa Lee. They perform a limited and limiting performance as a group called \\"Us Girls\\" (see video). The first lyrics you hear are sung (vs. rapped). This moment tends to diminish the significance of women in early hip hop performance as if by 1984 female emcees were already exceptional to a musical genre that was still emerging and developing. The group sings in unison, \\"Us Girls / Can Boogie, too,\\" then each emcee performs a short rhyme.DMC of Run DMC said that MC Sha-Rock aka Sharon Green, an innovator as an early emcee, also female or a b-girl, significantly influenced the group's style of rapping in an echo- chamber style (listen here). He considered her style, genre-breaking. This edit on female presence was written by Kyra Gaunt, Ph.D., author of The Games Black Girls Play: Learning the Ropes from Double-Dutch to Hip-Hop, 2006. The film also includes other musical performances from Tina B and The System, both of whom appear on the soundtrack album. Though not featured on the album, there were also appearances by rapper Richard Lee Sisco and singers Bernard Fowler and Brenda K. Starr, known as the Queen of freestyle who later became a Latin artist. At least three breakdancing battles between the New York City Breakers and the Rock Steady Crew were also included in the film. In addition, the Roxy audition scene features a pair of breakdancing boys known as the Fantastic Duo. This was the first American film to feature more than one soundtrack album. Originally, Atlantic Records, which released the soundtrack albums, had three volumes planned, but only two of these were released. The second volume was never released on compact disc. The trailer includes an alternate version of the title song performed by Kool Moe Dee, a version that was not featured in the movie or on the original soundtrack albums. Legacy Beat Street's impact was felt internationally as well as throughout the United States. In Germany, for example, movies such as Beat Street and Wild Style are credited with introducing the hip hop movement to the country. Because movies are so easily distributed over borders, part of the importance of this movie lay in its ability to influence both East Germany and West Germany, which at the time were still divided.Brown, Timothy S. \\"Keeping it Real in a Different Hood: (African-) Americanization and Hip-hop in Germany.\\" In The Vinyl Ain't Final: Hip Hop and the Globalization of Black Popular Culture, ed. by Dipannita Basu and Sidney J. Lemelle, pp. 137‚Äì150. London. Beat Street was of particular importance in the East, where it is said to illustrate for young people the evils of capitalism. Because the film focused so heavily on the visual aspects of hip hop, such as breaking and graffiti, these aspects had the heaviest influence on the emerging German hip hop scene.\\"Beat Street\\" http://www.fast-rewind.com/ It was precisely these visual aspects that helped bring hip hop culture to Germany, rather than simply a genre of music. Beat Street appeared in the German Democratic Republic at almost the same time as in the West. Dresden, the center of the Beat Street scene was geographically out of western media range, making it a perfect center to explore this genre of music. The hip hop scene for the entire public would meet at breakdancing competitions, emceeing competitions, and graffiti spraying.Elflein, Dietmar. \\"From Krauts with Attitudes to Turks with Attitudes: Some Aspects of Hip-Hop History in Germany.\\" Popular Music, Vol. 17, No. 3. (Oct., 1998), pp. 255‚Äì265. Puerto Rican and African American breakdancing, hip hop and Latin freestyle dance sounds, and inner-city American graffiti made up what Germans knew as hip hop culture. The aftermath of Beat Street propelled events such as competitions in emceeing, break dancing, and graffiti spraying throughout Germany. In popular culture  *AZ mentions the film in his song \\"The Come Up\\", in the line \\"Before Beat Street, streets was heavily in deep with the ryders.\\" *The Notorious B.I.G. in his song \\"Suicidal Thoughts\\" said, \\"Should I die on the train tracks like Ramo in Beat Street/People at my funeral frontin' like they miss me.\\" *Jay Electronica mentions the film in his song \\"Exhibit A (Transformations)\\" in the line \\"Who gone bring the game back/who gone spit that Ramo on the train tracks\\". *Ras Kass in his song \\"Won't Catch Me Runnin'\\" said, \\"When my voice hits the mike, I electrocute Spit like Beat Street.\\" *Mr. Lif, on \\"Elektro\\", rapped the lines: \\"So I use the same flow to put niggas under in The Serpent and the Rainbow/Go back to Beat Street and resurrect Ramo knock the shit out of Spit verbal eclipse\\" See also * Krush Groove * Breakin' * Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo * Wild Style * Style Wars References External links   Original script * Official site Category:1984 films Category:1980s teen drama films Category:1980s musical drama films Category:American dance films Category:American musical drama films Category:American films Category:American teen drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films shot in New York City Category:Films directed by Stan Lathan Category:1980s hip hop films Category:Orion Pictures films Category:New York City hip hop Category:1984 drama films ","title":"Beat Street"},{"id":"396286","text":"In physics, Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau theory, often called Landau‚ÄìGinzburg theory, named after Vitaly Lazarevich Ginzburg and Lev Landau, is a mathematical physical theory used to describe superconductivity. In its initial form, it was postulated as a phenomenological model which could describe type-I superconductors without examining their microscopic properties. One GL-type superconductor is the famous YBCO, and generally all Cuprates.Wesche, Chapter 50: High Temperature Superconductors, Springer 2017, at p. 1233, contained in Casap, Kapper Handbook Later, a version of Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau theory was derived from the Bardeen‚ÄìCooper‚ÄìSchrieffer microscopic theory by Lev Gor'kov, thus showing that it also appears in some limit of microscopic theory and giving microscopic interpretation of all its parameters. The theory can also be given a general geometric setting, placing it in the context of Riemannian geometry, where in many cases exact solutions can be given. This general setting then extends to quantum field theory and string theory, again owing to its solvability, and its close relation to other, similar systems. Introduction Based on Landau's previously established theory of second- order phase transitions, Ginzburg and Landau argued that the free energy, F, of a superconductor near the superconducting transition can be expressed in terms of a complex order parameter field, œà, which is nonzero below a phase transition into a superconducting state and is related to the density of the superconducting component, although no direct interpretation of this parameter was given in the original paper. Assuming smallness of œà and smallness of its gradients, the free energy has the form of a field theory. : F = F_n + \\\\alpha \\\\psi^2 + \\\\frac{\\\\beta}{2} \\\\psi^4 + \\\\frac{1}{2m} \\\\left \\\\left(-i\\\\hbar abla - 2e\\\\mathbf{A} \\\\right) \\\\psi \\\\right^2 + \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{B}^2}{2\\\\mu_0} where Fn is the free energy in the normal phase, Œ± and Œ≤ in the initial argument were treated as phenomenological parameters, m is an effective mass, e is the charge of an electron, A is the magnetic vector potential, and \\\\mathbf{B}= abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{A} is the magnetic field. By minimizing the free energy with respect to variations in the order parameter and the vector potential, one arrives at the Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau equations : \\\\alpha \\\\psi + \\\\beta \\\\psi^2 \\\\psi + \\\\frac{1}{2m} \\\\left(-i\\\\hbar abla - 2e\\\\mathbf{A} \\\\right)^2 \\\\psi = 0 : abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{B} = \\\\mu_{0}\\\\mathbf{j} \\\\;\\\\; ; \\\\;\\\\; \\\\mathbf{j} = \\\\frac{2e}{m} \\\\operatorname{Re} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\psi^* \\\\left(-i\\\\hbar abla - 2e \\\\mathbf{A} \\\\right) \\\\psi \\\\right\\\\\\\\} where j denotes the dissipation-less electric current density and Re the real part. The first equation ‚Äî which bears some similarities to the time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation, but is principally different due to a nonlinear term ‚Äî determines the order parameter, œà. The second equation then provides the superconducting current. Simple interpretation Consider a homogeneous superconductor where there is no superconducting current and the equation for œà simplifies to: : \\\\alpha \\\\psi + \\\\beta \\\\psi^2 \\\\psi = 0. \\\\, This equation has a trivial solution: œà = 0. This corresponds to the normal conducting state, that is for temperatures above the superconducting transition temperature, T > Tc. Below the superconducting transition temperature, the above equation is expected to have a non-trivial solution (that is œà ‚â† 0). Under this assumption the equation above can be rearranged into: : \\\\psi^2 = - \\\\frac\\\\alpha \\\\beta. When the right hand side of this equation is positive, there is a nonzero solution for œà (remember that the magnitude of a complex number can be positive or zero). This can be achieved by assuming the following temperature dependence of Œ±: with Œ±0/Œ≤ > 0: *Above the superconducting transition temperature, T > Tc, the expression Œ±(T)/Œ≤ is positive and the right hand side of the equation above is negative. The magnitude of a complex number must be a non-negative number, so only œà = 0 solves the Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau equation. *Below the superconducting transition temperature, T < Tc, the right hand side of the equation above is positive and there is a non-trivial solution for œà. Furthermore, :: \\\\psi^2 = - \\\\frac{\\\\alpha_0 (T - T_c)} \\\\beta, : that is œà approaches zero as T gets closer to Tc from below. Such a behaviour is typical for a second order phase transition. In Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau theory the electrons that contribute to superconductivity were proposed to form a superfluid. In this interpretation, œà2 indicates the fraction of electrons that have condensed into a superfluid. Coherence length and penetration depth The Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau equations predicted two new characteristic lengths in a superconductor. The first characteristic length was termed coherence length, Œæ. For T > Tc (normal phase), it is given by : \\\\xi = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2 m \\\\alpha}}. while for T < Tc (superconducting phase), where it is more relevant, it is given by : \\\\xi = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{4 m \\\\alpha}}. It sets the exponential law according to which small perturbations of density of superconducting electrons recover their equilibrium value œà0. Thus this theory characterized all superconductors by two length scales. The second one is the penetration depth, Œª. It was previously introduced by the London brothers in their London theory. Expressed in terms of the parameters of Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau model it is : \\\\lambda = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{m}{4 \\\\mu_0 e^2 \\\\psi_0^2}} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{m\\\\beta}{4 \\\\mu_0 e^2 \\\\alpha}}, where œà0 is the equilibrium value of the order parameter in the absence of an electromagnetic field. The penetration depth sets the exponential law according to which an external magnetic field decays inside the superconductor. The original idea on the parameter Œ∫ belongs to Landau. The ratio Œ∫ = Œª/Œæ is presently known as the Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau parameter. It has been proposed by Landau that Type I superconductors are those with 0 < Œ∫ < 1/, and Type II superconductors those with Œ∫ > 1/. Fluctuations in the Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau model Taking into account fluctuations. For Type II superconductors, the phase transition from the normal state is of second order, as demonstrated by Dasgupta and Halperin. While for Type I superconductors it is of first order as demonstrated by Halperin, Lubensky and Ma. Classification of superconductors based on Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau theory In the original paper Ginzburg and Landau observed the existence of two types of superconductors depending on the energy of the interface between the normal and superconducting states. The Meissner state breaks down when the applied magnetic field is too large. Superconductors can be divided into two classes according to how this breakdown occurs. In Type I superconductors, superconductivity is abruptly destroyed when the strength of the applied field rises above a critical value Hc. Depending on the geometry of the sample, one may obtain an intermediate state consisting of a baroque pattern of regions of normal material carrying a magnetic field mixed with regions of superconducting material containing no field. In Type II superconductors, raising the applied field past a critical value Hc1 leads to a mixed state (also known as the vortex state) in which an increasing amount of magnetic flux penetrates the material, but there remains no resistance to the flow of electric current as long as the current is not too large. At a second critical field strength Hc2, superconductivity is destroyed. The mixed state is actually caused by vortices in the electronic superfluid, sometimes called fluxons because the flux carried by these vortices is quantized. Most pure elemental superconductors, except niobium and carbon nanotubes, are Type I, while almost all impure and compound superconductors are Type II. The most important finding from Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau theory was made by Alexei Abrikosov in 1957. He used Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau theory to explain experiments on superconducting alloys and thin films. He found that in a type-II superconductor in a high magnetic field, the field penetrates in a triangular lattice of quantized tubes of flux vortices.Abrikosov, A. A. (1957). The magnetic properties of superconducting alloys. Journal of Physics and Chemistry of Solids, 2(3), 199‚Äì208. Geometric formulation The Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau functional can be formulated in the general setting of a complex vector bundle over a compact Riemannian manifold. This is the same functional as given above, transposed to the notation commonly used in Riemannian geometry. In multiple interesting cases, it can be shown to exhibit the same phenomena as the above, including Abrikosov vortices (see discussion below). For a complex vector bundle E over a Riemannian manifold M with fiber \\\\Complex^n, the order parameter \\\\psi is understood as a section of the vector bundle E. The Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau functional is then a Lagrangian for that section: :\\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\psi, A)=\\\\int_M \\\\sqrt{g} dx^1\\\\wedge\\\\cdots\\\\wedge dx^m \\\\left[ \\\\vert F \\\\vert^2 + \\\\vert D \\\\psi\\\\vert^2 + \\\\frac{1}{4} \\\\left( \\\\sigma-\\\\vert\\\\psi\\\\vert^2\\\\right)^2 \\\\right] The notation used here is as follows. The fibers \\\\Complex^n are assumed to be equipped with a Hermitian inner product \\\\langle\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot\\\\rangle so that the square of the norm is written as \\\\vert\\\\psi\\\\vert^2=\\\\langle\\\\psi,\\\\psi\\\\rangle. The phenomenological parameters \\\\alpha and \\\\beta have been absorbed so that the potential energy term is a quartic mexican hat potential, i.e. exhibiting spontaneous symmetry breaking, with a minimum at some real value \\\\sigma\\\\in\\\\R. The integral is explicitly over the volume form :*(1)=\\\\sqrt{g} dx^1\\\\wedge\\\\cdots\\\\wedge dx^m for an m-dimensional manifold M with determinant g of the metric tensor g. The D=d + A is the connection one-form and F is the corresponding curvature 2-form (this is not the same as the free energy F given up top; here, F corresponds to the electromagnetic field strength tensor). The A corresponds to the vector potential, but is in general non- Abelian when n> 1, and is normalized differently. In physics, one conventionally writes the connection as d-ieA for the electric charge e and vector potential A; in Riemannian geometry, it is more convenient to drop the e (and all other physical units) and take A=A_\\\\mu dx^\\\\mu to be a one-form taking values in the Lie algebra corresponding to the symmetry group of the fiber. Here, the symmetry group is SU(n), as that leaves the inner product \\\\langle\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot\\\\rangle invariant; so here, A is a form taking values in the algebra \\\\mathfrak{su}(n). The curvature F generalizes the electromagnetic field strength to the non-Abelian setting, as the curvature form of an affine connection on a vector bundle . It is conventionally written as :\\\\begin{align} F &= D \\\\circ D \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= dA + A \\\\wedge A \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial A_ u}{\\\\partial x^\\\\mu} + A_\\\\mu A_ u \\\\right)dx^\\\\mu \\\\wedge dx^ u \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial A_ u}{\\\\partial x^\\\\mu} -\\\\frac{\\\\partial A_\\\\mu}{\\\\partial x^ u} \\\\+ [A_\\\\mu, A_ u] \\\\right)dx^\\\\mu \\\\wedge dx^ u \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} That is, each A_\\\\mu is an n\\\\times n skew-symmetric matrix. (See the article on the metric connection for additional articulation of this specific notation.) To emphasize this, note that the first term of the Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau functional, involving the field-strength only, is :\\\\mathcal{L}(A)=YM(A) = \\\\int_M *(1) \\\\vert F \\\\vert^2 which is just the Yang‚ÄìMills action on a compact Riemannian manifold. The Euler‚ÄìLagrange equations for the Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau functional are the Yang‚ÄìMills equations :D*D\\\\psi = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(\\\\sigma - \\\\vert\\\\psi\\\\vert^2\\\\right)\\\\psi and :D*F=-\\\\operatorname{Re}\\\\langle D\\\\psi, \\\\psi\\\\rangle where * is the Hodge star operator, i.e. the fully antisymmetric tensor. Note that these are closely related to the Yang‚ÄìMills‚ÄìHiggs equations. =Specific results= In string theory, it is conventional to study the Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau functional for the manifold M being a Riemann surface, and taking n=1, i.e. a line bundle. The phenomenon of Abrikosov vortices persists in these general cases, including M=\\\\R^2, where one can specify any finite set of points where \\\\psi vanishes, including multiplicity. The proof generalizes to arbitrary Riemann surfaces and to K√§hler manifolds. In the limit of weak coupling, it can be shown that \\\\vert\\\\psi\\\\vert converges uniformly to 1, while D\\\\psi and dA converge uniformly to zero, and the curvature becomes a sum over delta-function distributions at the vortices.M.C. Hong, J, Jost, M Struwe, \\"Asymptotic limits of a Ginzberg- Landau type functional\\", Geometric Analysis and the Calculus of Variations for Stefan Hildebrandt (1996) International press (Boston) pp. 99-123. The sum over vortices, with multiplicity, just equals the degree of the line bundle; as a result, one may write a line bundle on a Riemann surface as a flat bundle, with N singular points and a covariantly constant section. When the manifold is four-dimensional, possessing a spinc structure, then one may write a very similar functional, the Seiberg‚ÄìWitten functional, which may be analyzed in a similar fashion, and which possesses many similar properties, including self-duality. When such systems are integrable, they are studied as Hitchin systems. Self-duality When the manifold M is a Riemann surface M=\\\\Sigma, the functional can be re-written so as to explicitly show self- duality. One achieves this by writing the exterior derivative as a sum of Dolbeault operators d=\\\\partial+\\\\overline\\\\partial. Likewise, the space \\\\Omega^1 of one-forms over a Riemann surface decomposes into a space that is holomorphic, and one that is anti-holomorphic: \\\\Omega^1=\\\\Omega^{1,0}\\\\oplus\\\\Omega^{0,1}, so that forms in \\\\Omega^{1,0} are holomorphic in z and have no dependence on \\\\overline z; and vice-versa for \\\\Omega^{0,1}. This allows the vector potential to be written as A=A^{1,0}+A^{0,1} and likewise D=\\\\partial_A + \\\\overline\\\\partial_A with \\\\partial_A=\\\\partial+A^{1,0} and \\\\overline\\\\partial_A=\\\\overline\\\\partial+A^{0,1}. For the case of n=1, where the fiber is \\\\Complex so that the bundle is a line bundle, the field strength can similarly be written as :F=-\\\\left(\\\\partial_A \\\\overline\\\\partial_A + \\\\overline\\\\partial_A \\\\partial_A\\\\right) Note that in the sign-convention being used here, both A^{1,0}, A^{0,1} and F are purely imaginary (viz U(1) is generated by e^{i\\\\theta} so derivatives are purely imaginary). The functional then becomes :\\\\mathcal{L}\\\\left(\\\\psi,A\\\\right)= 2\\\\pi\\\\sigma \\\\operatorname{deg} L + \\\\int_\\\\Sigma \\\\frac{i}{2} dz \\\\wedge d\\\\overline z \\\\left[2 \\\\vert\\\\overline\\\\partial_A\\\\psi\\\\vert^2 + \\\\left(*(-iF) - \\\\frac{1}{2} (\\\\sigma - \\\\vert\\\\psi\\\\vert^2 \\\\right)^2 \\\\right] The integral is understood to be over the volume form :*(1) = \\\\frac{i}{2} dz \\\\wedge d\\\\overline z, so that :\\\\operatorname{Area}\\\\Sigma = \\\\int_\\\\Sigma *(1) is the total area of the surface \\\\Sigma. The * is the Hodge star, as before. The degree \\\\operatorname{deg} L of the line bundle L over the surface \\\\Sigma is :\\\\operatorname{deg}L = c_1(L) = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi} \\\\int_\\\\Sigma iF where c_1(L) = c_1(L)[\\\\Sigma]\\\\in H^2(\\\\Sigma) is the first Chern class. The Lagrangian is minimized (stationary) when \\\\psi,A solve the Ginzberg‚ÄìLandau equations :\\\\begin{align} \\\\overline\\\\partial_A \\\\psi &= 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ *(iF) &= \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left(\\\\sigma - \\\\vert\\\\psi\\\\vert^2 \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} Note that these are both first-order differential equations, manifestly self-dual. Integrating the second of these, one quickly finds that a non-trivial solution must obey :4\\\\pi \\\\operatorname{deg}L \\\\le \\\\sigma \\\\operatorname{Area} \\\\Sigma. Roughly speaking, this can be interpreted as an upper limit to the density of the Abrikosov vortecies. One can also show that the solutions are bounded; one must have \\\\psi\\\\le\\\\sigma. Landau‚ÄìGinzburg theories in string theory In particle physics, any quantum field theory with a unique classical vacuum state and a potential energy with a degenerate critical point is called a Landau‚ÄìGinzburg theory. The generalization to N = (2,2) supersymmetric theories in 2 spacetime dimensions was proposed by Cumrun Vafa and Nicholas Warner in the November 1988 article Catastrophes and the Classification of Conformal Theories, in this generalization one imposes that the superpotential possess a degenerate critical point. The same month, together with Brian Greene they argued that these theories are related by a renormalization group flow to sigma models on Calabi‚ÄìYau manifolds in the paper Calabi‚ÄìYau Manifolds and Renormalization Group Flows. In his 1993 paper Phases of N = 2 theories in two-dimensions, Edward Witten argued that Landau‚ÄìGinzburg theories and sigma models on Calabi‚ÄìYau manifolds are different phases of the same theory. A construction of such a duality was given by relating the Gromov‚ÄìWitten theory of Calabi‚ÄìYau orbifolds to FJRW theory an analogous Landau‚ÄìGinzburg \\"FJRW\\" theory in The Witten Equation, Mirror Symmetry and Quantum Singularity Theory. Witten's sigma models were later used to describe the low energy dynamics of 4-dimensional gauge theories with monopoles as well as brane constructions.

The fuselage was lengthened to , and ballooned out to a maximum inside diameter of , the length of the cargo compartment being . The floor of the cargo compartment was still only wide, as necessitated by the use of the Stratocruiser fuselage.

This variant used Allison 501-D22C turboprops. Unlike the previous Guppy, the main portion of its fuselage was constructed from scratch. By building from scratch, Aero Spacelines was able to widen the floor of the cargo compartment to . The overall cargo-compartment length was increased to , and the improved fuselage and engines allowed for a maximum load of . These design improvements, combined with a pressurized crew cabin that allowed for higher-altitude cruising, allowed the SGT to transport more cargo than its predecessors. The SGT retained only the cockpit, wings, tail, and main landing gear of the 377. The nose gear was taken from a Boeing 707 and rotated 180 degrees. This dropped the front of the aircraft slightly, leveling the cargo-bay floor and simplifying loading operations. In the early 1970s, the two Super Guppy Turbines were used by Airbus to transport airplane parts from decentralized production facilities to the final assembly plant in Toulouse. In 1982 and 1983, two additional Super Guppy Turbines were built by Union de Transports A√©riens Industries in France after Airbus bought the right to produce the aircraft.

He became involved with the alleged Conway Cabal with Horatio Gates. He later served with √âmigr√© forces during the French Revolutionary War. Early life Conway was born in Ireland to James Conway and his wife Julieanne Conway. Though born to a Catholic family, it is unclear how closely he adhered to the faith. As a child, he immigrated to France with his parents. At 14, he enrolled in the Irish Brigade of the French Army and rose rapidly to colonel by 1772. Arrival in America Following the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War he volunteered to the Congress for service with the American rebels in 1777. Based on an introduction from Silas Deane, the Congress appointed him a brigadier general on May 13, and sent him on to George Washington. Conway commanded the leading brigade on the American right flank at the Battle of Germantown, and was justly praised for his actions. However, Washington opposed his promotion to major general, believing that many American-born officers with longer and valuable service deserved the rank; this caused a falling out between Washington and Conway. Congress appointed Conway a major general despite Washington's objections in December 1777, and made him inspector general of the army. Conway Cabal When his name was used politically, it was used to describe the infighting known as the Conway Cabal. During the affair, he had written a letter to General Horatio Gates in which he referred to Washington as a \\"weak general,\\" criticizing General Washington's failed tactics against British General William Howe.Buescher, John and Ron Martin. \\"Dissent in the Ranks.\\" Teachinghistory.org. Accessed 30 June 2011. The letter stated: \\"Heaven has been determined to save your country; or a weak general [George Washington] and bad counselors would have ruined it.\\"Nathaniel Philbrick, \\"Valiant Ambition: George Washington, Benedict Arnold and the Fate of the American Revolution,\\" (New York: Penguin Books, 2016), p. 180 The letter was intercepted by Washington and his backers after its delivery was botched by Brigadier General James Wilkinson, and brought before the Congress for inquiry. When the contents of the letter were made public, Conway lost his command as a result. He tried a ploy that had worked before his promotion, and submitted his resignation to Congress in March 1778. This time it was accepted, so he was forced to leave the continental army. John Cadwalader shot him in a duel on July 4, 1778. When he recovered, he wrote an apology to Washington and returned to France. There is also a slightly different version of these happenings: Later life Conway later returned to the French Army, in 1787 he received promotion to Mar√©chal-de-camp (Major General) and an appointment as Governor of French colonies in India. In 1793 he fought with royalist forces in opposition to French Revolution in southern France. During the French Revolution he was condemned to death. He was saved only by an appeal to Great Britain (against which he had fought in the American Revolution), but was compelled to flee from France for his life. After that Conway disappeared from history. He is supposed to have died about 1800 in Ireland with a loving wife and children.

From Halkirk the B874 road runs towards Thurso in the north and towards Georgemas in the east. The village is within the parish of Halkirk, and is said by locals to be Scotland's first planned village. Cathedral It was at one time the site of the cathedral of the Diocese of Caithness. In the early 13th century, a revolt against the tithe, imposed by the Bishop, lead the local husbandmen to lay siege to the cathedral kitchen, and burn it down, with Adam of Melrose, the Bishop, still inside. Adam's successor moved the seat of the Diocese to Dornoch, and there are no remains of the Halkirk cathedral church or the bishop's seat. Historic distilleries Halkirk has had two whisky distilleries, Gerston from 1796 to 1885, and Ben Morven (also known as Gerston II) from 1886 to circa 1911. Both were established on the banks of the River Thurso, near Gerston Farm, and both drew water from Calder Burn. The Ben Morven distillery was named for the mountain, the highest point in Caithness. The original Gerston distillery was first registered by a Francis Swanson, and was expanded by two sons, John and James, in 1825. Sir Robert Peel is said to have acquired a taste for the whisky. The distillery closed not long after it was sold to new owners in 1872, and a London company, calling themselves the Gerston Distillery Company, decided to build a new distillery. In 1897 the new distillery was sold to Northern Distilleries Limited, who gave it the Ben Morven name. It was never very successful, and it closed circa 1911. The stillhouse is still standing.

Matrix mechanics was the first conceptually autonomous and logically consistent formulation of quantum mechanics. Its account of quantum jumps supplanted the Bohr model's electron orbits. It did so by interpreting the physical properties of particles as matrices that evolve in time. It is equivalent to the Schr√∂dinger wave formulation of quantum mechanics, as manifest in Dirac's bra‚Äìket notation. In some contrast to the wave formulation, it produces spectra of (mostly energy) operators by purely algebraic, ladder operator, methods.Herbert S. Green (1965). Matrix mechanics (P. Noordhoff Ltd, Groningen, Netherlands) ASIN : B0006BMIP8. Relying on these methods, Pauli derived the hydrogen atom spectrum in 1926, before the development of wave mechanics.  Development of matrix mechanics  In 1925, Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, and Pascual Jordan formulated the matrix mechanics representation of quantum mechanics. = Epiphany at Helgoland = In 1925 Werner Heisenberg was working in G√∂ttingen on the problem of calculating the spectral lines of hydrogen. By May 1925 he began trying to describe atomic systems by observables only. On June 7, to escape the effects of a bad attack of hay fever, Heisenberg left for the pollen free North Sea island of Helgoland. While there, in between climbing and learning by heart poems from Goethe's West-√∂stlicher Diwan, he continued to ponder the spectral issue and eventually realised that adopting non- commuting observables might solve the problem, and he later wroteW.

Heisenberg then departed for a while, leaving Born to analyse the paper.W. Heisenberg, √úber quantentheoretische Umdeutung kinematischer und mechanischer Beziehungen, Zeitschrift f√ºr Physik, 33, 879-893, 1925 (received July 29, 1925). [English translation in: B. L. van der Waerden, editor, Sources of Quantum Mechanics (Dover Publications, 1968) (English title: \\"Quantum-Theoretical Re- interpretation of Kinematic and Mechanical Relations\\").] In the paper, Heisenberg formulated quantum theory without sharp electron orbits. Hendrik Kramers had earlier calculated the relative intensities of spectral lines in the Sommerfeld model by interpreting the Fourier coefficients of the orbits as intensities. But his answer, like all other calculations in the old quantum theory, was only correct for large orbits. Heisenberg, after a collaboration with Kramers,H. A. Kramers und W. Heisenberg, √úber die Streuung von Strahlung durch Atome, Zeitschrift f√ºr Physik 31, 681-708 (1925). began to understand that the transition probabilities were not quite classical quantities, because the only frequencies that appear in the Fourier series should be the ones that are observed in quantum jumps, not the fictional ones that come from Fourier- analyzing sharp classical orbits. He replaced the classical Fourier series with a matrix of coefficients, a fuzzed-out quantum analog of the Fourier series. Classically, the Fourier coefficients give the intensity of the emitted radiation, so in quantum mechanics the magnitude of the matrix elements of the position operator were the intensity of radiation in the bright-line spectrum. The quantities in Heisenberg's formulation were the classical position and momentum, but now they were no longer sharply defined. Each quantity was represented by a collection of Fourier coefficients with two indices, corresponding to the initial and final states.Emilio Segr√®, From X-Rays to Quarks: Modern Physicists and their Discoveries (W. H. Freeman and Company, 1980) , pp 153‚Äì157.

Gustav Mie had used them in a paper on electrodynamics in 1912 and Born had used them in his work on the lattices theory of crystals in 1921. While matrices were used in these cases, the algebra of matrices with their multiplication did not enter the picture as they did in the matrix formulation of quantum mechanics.Jammer, 1966, pp. 206-207. Born, however, had learned matrix algebra from Rosanes, as already noted, but Born had also learned Hilbert's theory of integral equations and quadratic forms for an infinite number of variables as was apparent from a citation by Born of Hilbert's work Grundz√ºge einer allgemeinen Theorie der Linearen Integralgleichungen published in 1912.van der Waerden, 1968, p. 51.The citation by Born was in Born and Jordan's paper, the second paper in the trilogy which launched the matrix mechanics formulation.

For a number of years, he had been an assistant to Richard Courant at G√∂ttingen in the preparation of Courant and David Hilbert's book Methoden der mathematischen Physik I, which was published in 1924.Constance Ried Courant (Springer, 1996) p. 93. This book, fortuitously, contained a great many of the mathematical tools necessary for the continued development of quantum mechanics. In 1926, John von Neumann became assistant to David Hilbert, and he would coin the term Hilbert space to describe the algebra and analysis which were used in the development of quantum mechanics.John von Neumann Allgemeine Eigenwerttheorie Hermitescher Funktionaloperatoren, Mathematische Annalen 102 49‚Äì131 (1929)When von Neumann left G√∂ttingen in 1932, his book on the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics, based on Hilbert's mathematics, was published under the title Mathematische Grundlagen der Quantenmechanik. See: Norman Macrae, John von Neumann: The Scientific Genius Who Pioneered the Modern Computer, Game Theory, Nuclear Deterrence, and Much More (Reprinted by the American Mathematical Society, 1999) and Constance Reid, Hilbert (Springer-Verlag, 1996) . = Heisenberg's reasoning = Before matrix mechanics, the old quantum theory described the motion of a particle by a classical orbit, with well defined position and momentum X(t), P(t), with the restriction that the time integral over one period T of the momentum times the velocity must be a positive integer multiple of Planck's constant : \\\\int_0^T P \\\\; {dX \\\\over dt} \\\\; dt = \\\\int_0^T P \\\\; dX = n h . While this restriction correctly selects orbits with more or less the right energy values En, the old quantum mechanical formalism did not describe time dependent processes, such as the emission or absorption of radiation. When a classical particle is weakly coupled to a radiation field, so that the radiative damping can be neglected, it will emit radiation in a pattern that repeats itself every orbital period. The frequencies that make up the outgoing wave are then integer multiples of the orbital frequency, and this is a reflection of the fact that X(t) is periodic, so that its Fourier representation has frequencies 2œÄn/T only. : X(t) = \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{2\\\\pi i nt / T} X_n . The coefficients Xn are complex numbers. The ones with negative frequencies must be the complex conjugates of the ones with positive frequencies, so that X(t) will always be real, : X_n = X_{-n}^* . A quantum mechanical particle, on the other hand, can not emit radiation continuously, it can only emit photons. Assuming that the quantum particle started in orbit number n, emitted a photon, then ended up in orbit number m, the energy of the photon is , which means that its frequency is . For large n and m, but with n‚àím relatively small, these are the classical frequencies by Bohr's correspondence principle : E_n-E_m \\\\approx h(n-m)/T . In the formula above, T is the classical period of either orbit n or orbit m, since the difference between them is higher order in h. But for n and m small, or if n ‚àí m is large, the frequencies are not integer multiples of any single frequency. Since the frequencies that the particle emits are the same as the frequencies in the Fourier description of its motion, this suggests that something in the time-dependent description of the particle is oscillating with frequency . Heisenberg called this quantity Xnm, and demanded that it should reduce to the classical Fourier coefficients in the classical limit. For large values of n, m but with n ‚àí m relatively small, Xnm is the th Fourier coefficient of the classical motion at orbit n. Since Xnm has opposite frequency to Xmn, the condition that X is real becomes :X_{nm}=X_{mn}^* . By definition, Xnm only has the frequency , so its time evolution is simple: : X_{nm}(t) = e^{2\\\\pi i(E_n - E_m)t/h} X_{nm}(0) . This is the original form of Heisenberg's equation of motion. Given two arrays Xnm and Pnm describing two physical quantities, Heisenberg could form a new array of the same type by combining the terms XnkPkm, which also oscillate with the right frequency. Since the Fourier coefficients of the product of two quantities is the convolution of the Fourier coefficients of each one separately, the correspondence with Fourier series allowed Heisenberg to deduce the rule by which the arrays should be multiplied, : (XP)_{mn} = \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty X_{mk} P_{kn} . Born pointed out that this is the law of matrix multiplication, so that the position, the momentum, the energy, all the observable quantities in the theory, are interpreted as matrices. Under this multiplication rule, the product depends on the order: XP is different from PX. The X matrix is a complete description of the motion of a quantum mechanical particle. Because the frequencies in the quantum motion are not multiples of a common frequency, the matrix elements cannot be interpreted as the Fourier coefficients of a sharp classical trajectory. Nevertheless, as matrices, X(t) and P(t) satisfy the classical equations of motion; also see Ehrenfest's theorem, below. = Matrix basics = When it was introduced by Werner Heisenberg, Max Born and Pascual Jordan in 1925, matrix mechanics was not immediately accepted and was a source of controversy, at first. Schr√∂dinger's later introduction of wave mechanics was greatly favored. Part of the reason was that Heisenberg's formulation was in an odd mathematical language, for the time, while Schr√∂dinger's formulation was based on familiar wave equations. But there was also a deeper sociological reason. Quantum mechanics had been developing by two paths, one led by Einstein, who emphasized the wave‚Äìparticle duality he proposed for photons, and the other led by Bohr, that emphasized the discrete energy states and quantum jumps that Bohr discovered. De Broglie had reproduced the discrete energy states within Einstein's framework‚Äî the quantum condition is the standing wave condition, and this gave hope to those in the Einstein school that all the discrete aspects of quantum mechanics would be subsumed into a continuous wave mechanics. Matrix mechanics, on the other hand, came from the Bohr school, which was concerned with discrete energy states and quantum jumps. Bohr's followers did not appreciate physical models that pictured electrons as waves, or as anything at all. They preferred to focus on the quantities that were directly connected to experiments. In atomic physics, spectroscopy gave observational data on atomic transitions arising from the interactions of atoms with light quanta. The Bohr school required that only those quantities that were in principle measurable by spectroscopy should appear in the theory. These quantities include the energy levels and their intensities but they do not include the exact location of a particle in its Bohr orbit. It is very hard to imagine an experiment that could determine whether an electron in the ground state of a hydrogen atom is to the right or to the left of the nucleus. It was a deep conviction that such questions did not have an answer. The matrix formulation was built on the premise that all physical observables are represented by matrices, whose elements are indexed by two different energy levels. The set of eigenvalues of the matrix were eventually understood to be the set of all possible values that the observable can have. Since Heisenberg's matrices are Hermitian, the eigenvalues are real. If an observable is measured and the result is a certain eigenvalue, the corresponding eigenvector is the state of the system immediately after the measurement. The act of measurement in matrix mechanics 'collapses' the state of the system. If one measures two observables simultaneously, the state of the system collapses to a common eigenvector of the two observables. Since most matrices don't have any eigenvectors in common, most observables can never be measured precisely at the same time. This is the uncertainty principle. If two matrices share their eigenvectors, they can be simultaneously diagonalized. In the basis where they are both diagonal, it is clear that their product does not depend on their order because multiplication of diagonal matrices is just multiplication of numbers. The uncertainty principle, by contrast, is an expression of the fact that often two matrices A and B do not always commute, i.e., that AB ‚àí BA does not necessarily equal 0. The fundamental commutation relation of matrix mechanics, :\\\\sum_k ( X_{nk} P_{km} - P_{nk} X_{km}) = {ih\\\\over 2\\\\pi} ~ \\\\delta_{nm} implies then that there are no states that simultaneously have a definite position and momentum. This principle of uncertainty holds for many other pairs of observables as well. For example, the energy does not commute with the position either, so it is impossible to precisely determine the position and energy of an electron in an atom. = Nobel Prize = In 1928, Albert Einstein nominated Heisenberg, Born, and Jordan for the Nobel Prize in Physics.Bernstein, 2004, p. 1004. The announcement of the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1932 was delayed until November 1933.Greenspan, 2005, p. 190. It was at that time that it was announced Heisenberg had won the Prize for 1932 \\"for the creation of quantum mechanics, the application of which has, inter alia, led to the discovery of the allotropic forms of hydrogen\\"Nobel Prize in Physics and 1933 ‚Äì Nobel Prize Presentation Speech. and Erwin Schr√∂dinger and Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac shared the 1933 Prize \\"for the discovery of new productive forms of atomic theory\\". It might well be asked why Born was not awarded the Prize in 1932, along with Heisenberg, and Bernstein proffers speculations on this matter. One of them relates to Jordan joining the Nazi Party on May 1, 1933, and becoming a Storm Trooper.Bernstein, 2005, p. 1004. Jordan's Party affiliations and Jordan's links to Born may well have affected Born's chance at the Prize at that time. Bernstein further notes that when Born finally won the Prize in 1954, Jordan was still alive, while the Prize was awarded for the statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics, attributable to Born alone.Bernstein, 2005, p. 1006. Heisenberg's reactions to Born for Heisenberg receiving the Prize for 1932 and for Born receiving the Prize in 1954 are also instructive in evaluating whether Born should have shared the Prize with Heisenberg. On November 25, 1933, Born received a letter from Heisenberg in which he said he had been delayed in writing due to a \\"bad conscience\\" that he alone had received the Prize \\"for work done in G√∂ttingen in collaboration ‚Äì you, Jordan and I.\\" Heisenberg went on to say that Born and Jordan's contribution to quantum mechanics cannot be changed by \\"a wrong decision from the outside.\\"Greenspan, 2005, p. 191. In 1954, Heisenberg wrote an article honoring Max Planck for his insight in 1900. In the article, Heisenberg credited Born and Jordan for the final mathematical formulation of matrix mechanics and Heisenberg went on to stress how great their contributions were to quantum mechanics, which were not \\"adequately acknowledged in the public eye.\\"Greenspan, 2005, pp. 285-286.  Mathematical development  Once Heisenberg introduced the matrices for X and P, he could find their matrix elements in special cases by guesswork, guided by the correspondence principle. Since the matrix elements are the quantum mechanical analogs of Fourier coefficients of the classical orbits, the simplest case is the harmonic oscillator, where the classical position and momentum, X(t) and P(t), are sinusoidal. = Harmonic oscillator = In units where the mass and frequency of the oscillator are equal to one (see nondimensionalization), the energy of the oscillator is : H = {1 \\\\over 2} (P^2 + X^2) ~. The level sets of are the clockwise orbits, and they are nested circles in phase space. The classical orbit with energy is : X(t)= \\\\sqrt{2E}\\\\cos(t) , \\\\qquad P(t) = - \\\\sqrt{2E}\\\\sin(t) ~. The old quantum condition dictates that the integral of over an orbit, which is the area of the circle in phase space, must be an integer multiple of Planck's constant. The area of the circle of radius is . So : E = {n h \\\\over 2\\\\pi} ~, or, in natural units where , the energy is an integer. The Fourier components of and are simple, and more so if they are combined into the quantities : A(t) = X(t) + i P(t) = \\\\sqrt{2E}\\\\,e^{-it}, \\\\quad A^\\\\dagger(t) = X(t) - i P(t) = \\\\sqrt{2E}\\\\,e^{it} . Both and have only a single frequency, and X and P can be recovered from their sum and difference. Since has a classical Fourier series with only the lowest frequency, and the matrix element is the th Fourier coefficient of the classical orbit, the matrix for is nonzero only on the line just above the diagonal, where it is equal to . The matrix for is likewise only nonzero on the line below the diagonal, with the same elements. Thus, from and , reconstruction yields : \\\\sqrt{2} X(0)= \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{h}{2 \\\\pi}}\\\\; \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & \\\\sqrt{1} & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sqrt{1} & 0 & \\\\sqrt{2} & 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\sqrt{2} & 0 & \\\\sqrt{3} & 0 & \\\\cdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\sqrt{3} & 0 & \\\\sqrt{4} & \\\\cdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix}, and : \\\\sqrt{2} P(0) = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{h}{2 \\\\pi}}\\\\; \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i\\\\sqrt{1} & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ i\\\\sqrt{1} & 0 & -i\\\\sqrt{2} & 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & i\\\\sqrt{2} & 0 & -i\\\\sqrt{3} & 0 & \\\\cdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & i\\\\sqrt{3} & 0 & -i\\\\sqrt{4} & \\\\cdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix}, which, up to the choice of units, are the Heisenberg matrices for the harmonic oscillator. Note that both matrices are hermitian, since they are constructed from the Fourier coefficients of real quantities. Finding and is direct, since they are quantum Fourier coefficients so they evolve simply with time, : X_{mn}(t) = X_{mn}(0) e^{i(E_m - E_n)t},\\\\quad P_{mn}(t) = P_{mn}(0) e^{i(E_m -E_n)t}~. The matrix product of and is not hermitian, but has a real and imaginary part. The real part is one half the symmetric expression , while the imaginary part is proportional to the commutator :[X,P]=(XP - PX) . It is simple to verify explicitly that in the case of the harmonic oscillator, is , multiplied by the identity. It is likewise simple to verify that the matrix : H ={1\\\\over 2}(X^2 + P^2) is a diagonal matrix, with eigenvalues . = Conservation of energy = The harmonic oscillator is an important case. Finding the matrices is easier than determining the general conditions from these special forms. For this reason, Heisenberg investigated the anharmonic oscillator, with Hamiltonian : H = {1\\\\over 2} P^2 + {1\\\\over 2} X^2 + \\\\epsilon X^3 ~. In this case, the and matrices are no longer simple off diagonal matrices, since the corresponding classical orbits are slightly squashed and displaced, so that they have Fourier coefficients at every classical frequency. To determine the matrix elements, Heisenberg required that the classical equations of motion be obeyed as matrix equations, : {dX \\\\over dt} = P \\\\quad {dP \\\\over dt} = - X - 3 \\\\epsilon X^2 ~. He noticed that if this could be done, then , considered as a matrix function of and , will have zero time derivative. : {dH\\\\over dt} = P*{dP\\\\over dt} + ( X + 3 \\\\epsilon X^2)*{dX\\\\over dt} = 0 ~, where is the anticommutator, : A*B = {1\\\\over 2}(AB+BA) ~ . Given that all the off diagonal elements have a nonzero frequency; being constant implies that is diagonal. It was clear to Heisenberg that in this system, the energy could be exactly conserved in an arbitrary quantum system, a very encouraging sign. The process of emission and absorption of photons seemed to demand that the conservation of energy will hold at best on average. If a wave containing exactly one photon passes over some atoms, and one of them absorbs it, that atom needs to tell the others that they can't absorb the photon anymore. But if the atoms are far apart, any signal cannot reach the other atoms in time, and they might end up absorbing the same photon anyway and dissipating the energy to the environment. When the signal reached them, the other atoms would have to somehow recall that energy. This paradox led Bohr, Kramers and Slater to abandon exact conservation of energy. Heisenberg's formalism, when extended to include the electromagnetic field, was obviously going to sidestep this problem, a hint that the interpretation of the theory will involve wavefunction collapse. = Differentiation trick ‚Äî canonical commutation relations = Demanding that the classical equations of motion are preserved is not a strong enough condition to determine the matrix elements. Planck's constant does not appear in the classical equations, so that the matrices could be constructed for many different values of and still satisfy the equations of motion, but with different energy levels. So, in order to implement his program, Heisenberg needed to use the old quantum condition to fix the energy levels, then fill in the matrices with Fourier coefficients of the classical equations, then alter the matrix coefficients and the energy levels slightly to make sure the classical equations are satisfied. This is clearly not satisfactory. The old quantum conditions refer to the area enclosed by the sharp classical orbits, which do not exist in the new formalism. The most important thing that Heisenberg discovered is how to translate the old quantum condition into a simple statement in matrix mechanics. To do this, he investigated the action integral as a matrix quantity, : \\\\int_0^T \\\\sum_k P_{mk}(t) {dX_{kn} \\\\over dt} dt \\\\,\\\\, \\\\stackrel{\\\\scriptstyle?}{\\\\approx} \\\\,\\\\, J_{mn} ~. There are several problems with this integral, all stemming from the incompatibility of the matrix formalism with the old picture of orbits. Which period T should be used? Semiclassically, it should be either m or n, but the difference is order , and an answer to order is sought. The quantum condition tells us that Jmn is 2œÄn on the diagonal, so the fact that J is classically constant tells us that the off-diagonal elements are zero. His crucial insight was to differentiate the quantum condition with respect to n. This idea only makes complete sense in the classical limit, where n is not an integer but the continuous action variable J, but Heisenberg performed analogous manipulations with matrices, where the intermediate expressions are sometimes discrete differences and sometimes derivatives. In the following discussion, for the sake of clarity, the differentiation will be performed on the classical variables, and the transition to matrix mechanics will be done afterwards, guided by the correspondence principle. In the classical setting, the derivative is the derivative with respect to J of the integral which defines J, so it is tautologically equal to 1. : {d \\\\over dJ } \\\\int_0^T P dX = 1 := \\\\int_0^T dt \\\\left( {dP\\\\over dJ} {dX\\\\over dt} + P{d\\\\over dJ}{dX\\\\over dt} \\\\right) = \\\\int_0^T dt \\\\left( {dP\\\\over dJ} {dX\\\\over dt} - {dP\\\\over dt}{dX\\\\over dJ} \\\\right) \\\\, where the derivatives dP/dJ and dX/dJ should be interpreted as differences with respect to J at corresponding times on nearby orbits, exactly what would be obtained if the Fourier coefficients of the orbital motion were differentiated. (These derivatives are symplectically orthogonal in phase space to the time derivatives dP/dt and dX/dt). The final expression is clarified by introducing the variable canonically conjugate to J, which is called the angle variable Œ∏: The derivative with respect to time is a derivative with respect to Œ∏, up to a factor of 2œÄT, : {2\\\\pi\\\\over T} \\\\int_0^T dt \\\\left( {dp \\\\over dJ} {dX\\\\over d\\\\theta} - {dP \\\\over d\\\\theta} {dX\\\\over dJ}\\\\right) =1 \\\\, . So the quantum condition integral is the average value over one cycle of the Poisson bracket of X and P. An analogous differentiation of the Fourier series of P dX demonstrates that the off-diagonal elements of the Poisson bracket are all zero. The Poisson bracket of two canonically conjugate variables, such as X and P, is the constant value 1, so this integral really is the average value of 1; so it is 1, as we knew all along, because it is dJ/dJ after all. But Heisenberg, Born and Jordan, unlike Dirac, were not familiar with the theory of Poisson brackets, so, for them, the differentiation effectively evaluated {X, P} in J, Œ∏ coordinates. The Poisson Bracket, unlike the action integral, does have a simple translation to matrix mechanics‚àí‚àíit normally corresponds to the imaginary part of the product of two variables, the commutator. To see this, examine the (antisymmetrized) product of two matrices A and B in the correspondence limit, where the matrix elements are slowly varying functions of the index, keeping in mind that the answer is zero classically. In the correspondence limit, when indices m, n are large and nearby, while k,r are small, the rate of change of the matrix elements in the diagonal direction is the matrix element of the J derivative of the corresponding classical quantity. So its possible to shift any matrix element diagonally through the correspondence, : A_{(m+r) (n+r)} - A_{mn} \\\\approx r\\\\; \\\\left({dA\\\\over dJ}\\\\right)_{m n} \\\\, where the right hand side is really only the (m ‚àí n)'th Fourier component of dA/dJ at the orbit near m to this semiclassical order, not a full well-defined matrix. The semiclassical time derivative of a matrix element is obtained up to a factor of i by multiplying by the distance from the diagonal, : ik A_{m (m+k)} \\\\approx \\\\left({T\\\\over 2\\\\pi} {dA\\\\over dt}\\\\right)_{m (m+k)} =\\\\left({dA\\\\over d\\\\theta}\\\\right)_{m (m+k)} \\\\, . since the coefficient Am(m+k) is semiclassically the k'th Fourier coefficient of the m-th classical orbit. The imaginary part of the product of A and B can be evaluated by shifting the matrix elements around so as to reproduce the classical answer, which is zero. The leading nonzero residual is then given entirely by the shifting. Since all the matrix elements are at indices which have a small distance from the large index position (m,m), it helps to introduce two temporary notations: for the matrices, and for the r'th Fourier components of classical quantities, : (AB - BA)[0,k] = \\\\sum_{r=-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} \\\\left( A[0,r] B[r,k] - A[r,k] B[0,r] \\\\right) : = \\\\sum_r \\\\left(\\\\; A[-r+k,k] + (r-k){dA \\\\over dJ}[r]\\\\; \\\\right) \\\\left(\\\\; B[0,k-r] + r {dB\\\\over dJ}[r-k] \\\\; \\\\right) - \\\\sum_r A[r,k]B[0,r] \\\\, . Flipping the summation variable in the first sum from to r' = k ‚àí r, the matrix element becomes, : \\\\sum_{r'} (\\\\;A[r',k] - r' {dA \\\\over dJ}[k-r']\\\\;)\\\\left(\\\\; B[0,r'] +(k-r'){dB\\\\over dJ}[r']\\\\;\\\\right)- \\\\sum_r A[r,k] B[0,r] \\\\, and it is clear that the principal (classical) part cancels. The leading quantum part, neglecting the higher order product of derivatives in the residual expression, is then :=\\\\sum_{r'} \\\\left(\\\\; {dB\\\\over dJ}[r'](k-r')A[r',k] - {dA\\\\over dJ}[k-r'] r' B[0,r']\\\\right) so that, finally, : (AB - BA)[0,k] =\\\\sum_{r'} \\\\left(\\\\; {dB\\\\over dJ}[r']i{dA\\\\over d\\\\theta}[k-r'] - {dA\\\\over dJ}[k-r']i{dB\\\\over d\\\\theta}[r']\\\\right) \\\\, which can be identified with times the -th classical Fourier component of the Poisson bracket. Heisenberg's original differentiation trick was eventually extended to a full semiclassical derivation of the quantum condition, in collaboration with Born and Jordan. Once they were able to establish that : \\\\frac{ih}{2\\\\pi} \\\\\\\\{X,P\\\\\\\\}_\\\\mathrm{PB} \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\longmapsto \\\\qquad \\\\qquad [ X , P ] \\\\equiv XP - PX = \\\\frac{ih}{2\\\\pi}\\\\, , this condition replaced and extended the old quantization rule, allowing the matrix elements of P and X for an arbitrary system to be determined simply from the form of the Hamiltonian. The new quantization rule was assumed to be universally true, even though the derivation from the old quantum theory required semiclassical reasoning. (A full quantum treatment, however, for more elaborate arguments of the brackets, was appreciated in the 1940s to amount to extending Poisson brackets to Moyal brackets.) = State vectors and the Heisenberg equation = To make the transition to standard quantum mechanics, the most important further addition was the quantum state vector, now written œà‚ü©, which is the vector that the matrices act on. Without the state vector, it is not clear which particular motion the Heisenberg matrices are describing, since they include all the motions somewhere. The interpretation of the state vector, whose components are written , was furnished by Born. This interpretation is statistical: the result of a measurement of the physical quantity corresponding to the matrix is random, with an average value equal to : \\\\sum_{mn} \\\\psi_m^* A_{mn} \\\\psi_n ~. Alternatively, and equivalently, the state vector gives the probability amplitude for the quantum system to be in the energy state . Once the state vector was introduced, matrix mechanics could be rotated to any basis, where the matrix need no longer be diagonal. The Heisenberg equation of motion in its original form states that evolves in time like a Fourier component, : A_{mn}(t) = e^{i(E_m - E_n)t} A_{mn} (0) ~, which can be recast in differential form : {dA_{mn}\\\\over dt} = i(E_m - E_n ) A_{mn} ~, and it can be restated so that it is true in an arbitrary basis, by noting that the matrix is diagonal with diagonal values , : {dA\\\\over dt} = i( H A - A H ) ~ . This is now a matrix equation, so it holds in any basis. This is the modern form of the Heisenberg equation of motion. Its formal solution is: :\\\\, A(t) = e^{iHt} A(0) e^{-iHt} ~. All these forms of the equation of motion above say the same thing, that is equivalent to , through a basis rotation by the unitary matrix , a systematic picture elucidated by Dirac in his bra‚Äìket notation. Conversely, by rotating the basis for the state vector at each time by , the time dependence in the matrices can be undone. The matrices are now time independent, but the state vector rotates, :  \\\\psi(t) \\\\rangle = e^{-iHt}  \\\\psi(0) \\\\rangle, \\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\; {d \\\\psi \\\\rangle \\\\over dt} = \\\\- i H  \\\\psi \\\\rangle ~. This is the Schr√∂dinger equation for the state vector, and this time- dependent change of basis amounts to transformation to the Schr√∂dinger picture, with ‚ü®xœà‚ü© = œà(x). In quantum mechanics in the Heisenberg picture the state vector, œà‚ü© does not change with time, while an observable A satisfies the Heisenberg equation of motion, The extra term is for operators such as : A=(X+ t^2 P) which have an explicit time dependence, in addition to the time dependence from the unitary evolution discussed. The Heisenberg picture does not distinguish time from space, so it is better suited to relativistic theories than the Schr√∂dinger equation. Moreover, the similarity to classical physics is more manifest: the Hamiltonian equations of motion for classical mechanics are recovered by replacing the commutator above by the Poisson bracket (see also below). By the Stone‚Äìvon Neumann theorem, the Heisenberg picture and the Schr√∂dinger picture must be unitarily equivalent, as detailed below.  Further results  Matrix mechanics rapidly developed into modern quantum mechanics, and gave interesting physical results on the spectra of atoms. = Wave mechanics = Jordan noted that the commutation relations ensure that P acts as a differential operator. The operator identity : [a,bc] = abc - bca = abc - bac + bac - bca = [a,b]c + b[a,c] \\\\, allows the evaluation of the commutator of P with any power of X, and it implies that : [P,X^n] = - i n~ X^{n-1} \\\\, which, together with linearity, implies that a P-commutator effectively differentiates any analytic matrix function of X. Assuming limits are defined sensibly, this extends to arbitrary functions‚àí‚àíbut the extension need not be made explicit until a certain degree of mathematical rigor is required, Since X is a Hermitian matrix, it should be diagonalizable, and it will be clear from the eventual form of P that every real number can be an eigenvalue. This makes some of the mathematics subtle, since there is a separate eigenvector for every point in space. In the basis where X is diagonal, an arbitrary state can be written as a superposition of states with eigenvalues x, : \\\\psi\\\\rangle = \\\\int_x \\\\psi(x)x\\\\rangle \\\\, , so that œà(x) = ‚ü®xœà‚ü©, and the operator X multiplies each eigenvector by x, : X \\\\psi\\\\rangle = \\\\int_x x \\\\psi(x) x\\\\rangle ~ . Define a linear operator D which differentiates , : D \\\\int_x \\\\psi(x)  x\\\\rangle = \\\\int_x \\\\psi'(x) x\\\\rangle \\\\, , and note that : (D X - X D) \\\\psi\\\\rangle = \\\\int_x \\\\left[ \\\\left(x \\\\psi(x)\\\\right)' - x \\\\psi'(x) \\\\right] x\\\\rangle = \\\\int_x \\\\psi(x) x\\\\rangle = \\\\psi\\\\rangle \\\\, , so that the operator ‚àíiD obeys the same commutation relation as P. Thus, the difference between P and ‚àíiD must commute with X, : [P+iD,X]=0 \\\\, , so it may be simultaneously diagonalized with X: its value acting on any eigenstate of X is some function f of the eigenvalue x. This function must be real, because both P and ‚àíiD are Hermitian, : (P+iD ) x\\\\rangle = f(x) x\\\\rangle \\\\, , rotating each state x\\\\rangle by a phase , that is, redefining the phase of the wavefunction: : \\\\psi(x) \\\\rightarrow e^{-if(x)} \\\\psi(x) \\\\, . The operator iD is redefined by an amount: : iD \\\\rightarrow iD + f(X) \\\\, , which means that, in the rotated basis, P is equal to ‚àíiD. Hence, there is always a basis for the eigenvalues of X where the action of P on any wavefunction is known: : P \\\\int_x \\\\psi(x) x\\\\rangle = \\\\int_x - i \\\\psi'(x) x\\\\rangle \\\\, , and the Hamiltonian in this basis is a linear differential operator on the state- vector components, : \\\\left[{P^2\\\\over 2m} + V(X) \\\\right] \\\\int_x \\\\psi_x x\\\\rangle = \\\\int_x \\\\left[-{1\\\\over 2m}{\\\\partial^2 \\\\over \\\\partial x^2} + V(x)\\\\right] \\\\psi_x x\\\\rangle Thus, the equation of motion for the state vector is but a celebrated differential equation, Since D is a differential operator, in order for it to be sensibly defined, there must be eigenvalues of X which neighbors every given value. This suggests that the only possibility is that the space of all eigenvalues of X is all real numbers, and that P is iD, up to a phase rotation. To make this rigorous requires a sensible discussion of the limiting space of functions, and in this space this is the Stone‚Äìvon Neumann theorem: any operators X and P which obey the commutation relations can be made to act on a space of wavefunctions, with P a derivative operator. This implies that a Schr√∂dinger picture is always available. Matrix mechanics easily extends to many degrees of freedom in a natural way. Each degree of freedom has a separate X operator and a separate effective differential operator P, and the wavefunction is a function of all the possible eigenvalues of the independent commuting X variables. : [X_i ,X_j ] = 0 \\\\, : [P_i, P_j ] = 0 \\\\, : [X_i ,P_j ] = i\\\\delta_{ij} \\\\, . In particular, this means that a system of N interacting particles in 3 dimensions is described by one vector whose components in a basis where all the X are diagonal is a mathematical function of 3N-dimensional space describing all their possible positions, effectively a much bigger collection of values than the mere collection of N three-dimensional wavefunctions in one physical space. Schr√∂dinger came to the same conclusion independently, and eventually proved the equivalence of his own formalism to Heisenberg's. Since the wavefunction is a property of the whole system, not of any one part, the description in quantum mechanics is not entirely local. The description of several quantum particles has them correlated, or entangled. This entanglement leads to strange correlations between distant particles which violate the classical Bell's inequality. Even if the particles can only be in just two positions, the wavefunction for N particles requires 2N complex numbers, one for each total configuration of positions. This is exponentially many numbers in N, so simulating quantum mechanics on a computer requires exponential resources. Conversely, this suggests that it might be possible to find quantum systems of size N which physically compute the answers to problems which classically require 2N bits to solve. This is the aspiration behind quantum computing. = Ehrenfest theorem = For the time-independent operators X and P, so the Heisenberg equation above reduces to:Quantum Mechanics, E. Abers, Pearson Ed., Addison Wesley, Prentice Hall Inc, 2004, :i\\\\hbar{dA \\\\over dt} = [A,H]= AH - HA , where the square brackets denote the commutator. For a Hamiltonian which is p^2/2m + V(x), the X and P operators satisfy: :{d X\\\\over dt} = {P\\\\over m},\\\\quad {d P \\\\over dt} = - abla V , where the first is classically the velocity, and second is classically the force, or potential gradient. These reproduce Hamilton's form of Newton's laws of motion. In the Heisenberg picture, the X and P operators satisfy the classical equations of motion. You can take the expectation value of both sides of the equation to see that, in any state œà‚ü©: :\\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\langle X\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\langle \\\\psiX\\\\psi \\\\rangle = \\\\frac{1}{m} \\\\langle \\\\psiP\\\\psi \\\\rangle = \\\\frac{1}{m} \\\\langle P \\\\rangle :\\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\langle P\\\\rangle =\\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\langle \\\\psiP\\\\psi \\\\rangle = \\\\langle \\\\psi  (- abla V) \\\\psi\\\\rangle = -\\\\langle abla V\\\\rangle \\\\, . So Newton's laws are exactly obeyed by the expected values of the operators in any given state. This is Ehrenfest's theorem, which is an obvious corollary of the Heisenberg equations of motion, but is less trivial in the Schr√∂dinger picture, where Ehrenfest discovered it. = Transformation theory = In classical mechanics, a canonical transformation of phase space coordinates is one which preserves the structure of the Poisson brackets. The new variables have the same Poisson brackets with each other as the original variables . Time evolution is a canonical transformation, since the phase space at any time is just as good a choice of variables as the phase space at any other time. The Hamiltonian flow is the canonical transformation: : x\\\\rightarrow x+dx = x + {\\\\partial H \\\\over \\\\partial p} dt : p \\\\rightarrow p+dp = p -{\\\\partial H \\\\over \\\\partial x} dt ~. Since the Hamiltonian can be an arbitrary function of x and p, there are such infinitesimal canonical transformations corresponding to every classical quantity , where serves as the Hamiltonian to generate a flow of points in phase space for an increment of time s, : dx = {\\\\partial G \\\\over \\\\partial p} ds = \\\\\\\\{ G,X \\\\\\\\} ds \\\\, : dp = -{\\\\partial G \\\\over \\\\partial x} ds = \\\\\\\\{ G,P \\\\\\\\} ds \\\\, . For a general function on phase space, its infinitesimal change at every step ds under this map is : dA = {\\\\partial A \\\\over \\\\partial x} dx + {\\\\partial A\\\\over \\\\partial p} dp = \\\\\\\\{ A,G\\\\\\\\} ds \\\\, . The quantity is called the infinitesimal generator of the canonical transformation. In quantum mechanics, the quantum analog is now a Hermitian matrix, and the equations of motion are given by commutators, : dA = i [G,A] ds \\\\, . The infinitesimal canonical motions can be formally integrated, just as the Heisenberg equation of motion were integrated, : A' = U^{\\\\dagger} A U \\\\, where and is an arbitrary parameter. The definition of a quantum canonical transformation is thus an arbitrary unitary change of basis on the space of all state vectors. is an arbitrary unitary matrix, a complex rotation in phase space, : U^{\\\\dagger}= U^{-1} \\\\, . These transformations leave the sum of the absolute square of the wavefunction components invariant, while they take states which are multiples of each other (including states which are imaginary multiples of each other) to states which are the same multiple of each other. The interpretation of the matrices is that they act as generators of motions on the space of states. For example, the motion generated by P can be found by solving the Heisenberg equation of motion using P as a Hamiltonian, : dX = i[X,P] ds = ds \\\\, : dP = i[P,P] ds = 0 \\\\, . These are translations of the matrix X by a multiple of the identity matrix, :X\\\\rightarrow X+s I ~. This is the interpretation of the derivative operator D: , the exponential of a derivative operator is a translation (so Lagrange's shift operator). The X operator likewise generates translations in P. The Hamiltonian generates translations in time, the angular momentum generates rotations in physical space, and the operator generates rotations in phase space. When a transformation, like a rotation in physical space, commutes with the Hamiltonian, the transformation is called a symmetry (behind a degeneracy) of the Hamiltonian‚àí‚àíthe Hamiltonian expressed in terms of rotated coordinates is the same as the original Hamiltonian. This means that the change in the Hamiltonian under the infinitesimal symmetry generator L vanishes, : {dH\\\\over ds} = i[L,H] = 0 \\\\, . It then follows that the change in the generator under time translation also vanishes, : {dL\\\\over dt} = i[H,L] = 0 \\\\, so that the matrix L is constant in time: it is conserved. The one-to-one association of infinitesimal symmetry generators and conservation laws was discovered by Emmy Noether for classical mechanics, where the commutators are Poisson brackets, but the quantum-mechanical reasoning is identical. In quantum mechanics, any unitary symmetry transformation yields a conservation law, since if the matrix U has the property that : U^{-1} H U = H \\\\, so it follows that :UH=HU and that the time derivative of U is zero‚Äîit is conserved. The eigenvalues of unitary matrices are pure phases, so that the value of a unitary conserved quantity is a complex number of unit magnitude, not a real number. Another way of saying this is that a unitary matrix is the exponential of i times a Hermitian matrix, so that the additive conserved real quantity, the phase, is only well-defined up to an integer multiple of 2œÄ. Only when the unitary symmetry matrix is part of a family that comes arbitrarily close to the identity are the conserved real quantities single-valued, and then the demand that they are conserved become a much more exacting constraint. Symmetries which can be continuously connected to the identity are called continuous, and translations, rotations, and boosts are examples. Symmetries which cannot be continuously connected to the identity are discrete, and the operation of space-inversion, or parity, and charge conjugation are examples. The interpretation of the matrices as generators of canonical transformations is due to Paul Dirac. The correspondence between symmetries and matrices was shown by Eugene Wigner to be complete, if antiunitary matrices which describe symmetries which include time-reversal are included. = Selection rules = It was physically clear to Heisenberg that the absolute squares of the matrix elements of , which are the Fourier coefficients of the oscillation, would yield the rate of emission of electromagnetic radiation. In the classical limit of large orbits, if a charge with position and charge is oscillating next to an equal and opposite charge at position 0, the instantaneous dipole moment is , and the time variation of this moment translates directly into the space-time variation of the vector potential, which yields nested outgoing spherical waves. For atoms, the wavelength of the emitted light is about 10,000 times the atomic radius, and the dipole moment is the only contribution to the radiative field, while all other details of the atomic charge distribution can be ignored. Ignoring back-reaction, the power radiated in each outgoing mode is a sum of separate contributions from the square of each independent time Fourier mode of , : P(\\\\omega) = {2\\\\over 3} {\\\\omega^4} d_i^2 ~. Now, in Heisenberg's representation, the Fourier coefficients of the dipole moment are the matrix elements of . This correspondence allowed Heisenberg to provide the rule for the transition intensities, the fraction of the time that, starting from an initial state , a photon is emitted and the atom jumps to a final state , : P_{ij} = {2 \\\\over 3} (E_i -E_j)^4 X_{ij}^2 \\\\, . This then allowed the magnitude of the matrix elements to be interpreted statistically: they give the intensity of the spectral lines, the probability for quantum jumps from the emission of dipole radiation. Since the transition rates are given by the matrix elements of , wherever is zero, the corresponding transition should be absent. These were called the selection rules, which were a puzzle until the advent of matrix mechanics. An arbitrary state of the Hydrogen atom, ignoring spin, is labelled by n;‚Ñì,m ‚ü©, where the value of ‚Ñì is a measure of the total orbital angular momentum and is its -component, which defines the orbit orientation. The components of the angular momentum pseudovector are : L_i = \\\\epsilon_{ijk} X^j P^k \\\\, where the products in this expression are independent of order and real, because different components of X and P commute. The commutation relations of L with all three coordinate matrices X, Y, Z (or with any vector) are easy to find, : [L_i, X_j] = i\\\\epsilon_{ijk} X_k \\\\, , which confirms that the operator L generates rotations between the three components of the vector of coordinate matrices X. From this, the commutator of Lz and the coordinate matrices X, Y, Z can be read off, : [L_z , X] = iY \\\\, , : [L_z,Y] = -iX \\\\, . This means that the quantities have a simple commutation rule, : [L_z,X+iY] = (X+iY) \\\\, , : [L_z,X-iY] = -(X-iY) \\\\, . Just like the matrix elements of X + iP and X ‚àí iP for the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian, this commutation law implies that these operators only have certain off diagonal matrix elements in states of definite m, : L_z ( (X+iY)m\\\\rangle )= (X+iY)L_zm\\\\rangle + (X+iY) m\\\\rangle = (m+1) (X+iY)m\\\\rangle \\\\, meaning that the matrix takes an eigenvector of with eigenvalue to an eigenvector with eigenvalue + 1. Similarly, decrease by one unit, while does not change the value of . So, in a basis of ‚Ñì,m‚ü© states where and have definite values, the matrix elements of any of the three components of the position are zero, except when is the same or changes by one unit. This places a constraint on the change in total angular momentum. Any state can be rotated so that its angular momentum is in the -direction as much as possible, where m = ‚Ñì. The matrix element of the position acting on ‚Ñì,m‚ü© can only produce values of m which are bigger by one unit, so that if the coordinates are rotated so that the final state is ‚Ñì',‚Ñì' ‚ü©, the value of ‚Ñì‚Äô can be at most one bigger than the biggest value of ‚Ñì that occurs in the initial state. So ‚Ñì‚Äô is at most ‚Ñì + 1. The matrix elements vanish for ‚Ñì‚Äô > ‚Ñì + 1, and the reverse matrix element is determined by Hermiticity, so these vanish also when ‚Ñì‚Äô < ‚Ñì - 1: Dipole transitions are forbidden with a change in angular momentum of more than one unit. = Sum rules = The Heisenberg equation of motion determines the matrix elements of P in the Heisenberg basis from the matrix elements of X. : P_{ij} = m{d\\\\over dt} X_{ij} = im (E_i - E_j) X_{ij} \\\\,, which turns the diagonal part of the commutation relation into a sum rule for the magnitude of the matrix elements: : \\\\sum_j P_{ij}x_{ji} - X_{ij}p_{ji} = i \\\\sum_j 2m(E_i - E_j) X_{ij}^2 = i \\\\, . This yields a relation for the sum of the spectroscopic intensities to and from any given state, although to be absolutely correct, contributions from the radiative capture probability for unbound scattering states must be included in the sum: : \\\\sum_j 2m(E_i - E_j) X_{ij}^2 = 1 \\\\, .

A punk zine (or punkzine) is a zine related to the punk subculture and hardcore punk music genre. Often primitively or casually produced, they feature punk literature, such as social commentary, punk poetry, news, gossip, music reviews and articles about punk rock bands or regional punk scenes. Etymology The term punkzine was possibly coined in the UK anarcho-punk scene, specifically by writers who objected to the connotations of the word fanzine, believing that the first part of the word implied the slavish following of musicians and unquestioning acceptance of celebrity culture. History =1970s: origins= Starting in the 1970s, the DIY aesthetic of the punk subculture created a thriving underground press. Amateur magazines related to punk were inspired by the rock fanzines of the early 1970s, which were inspired by zines from the science fiction fan community. Perhaps the most influential of the fanzines to cross over from science fiction fandom to rock and, later, punk rock and new wave music was Greg Shaw's Who Put the Bomp, founded in 1970. One of the earliest punk zines was Punk, founded in New York City by John Holmstrom, Ged Dunn and Legs McNeil. Debuting in January 1976, the zine championed the early New York underground music scene and helped associate the word \\"punk\\" with these bands, most notably the Ramones. Other early punkzines from the United States included Search & Destroy (later REsearch), Flipside and Slash. An early United Kingdom punk zine was Sniffin' Glue, produced by Mark Perry, who also founded the band Alternative TV, in 1976. Perry produced the first photocopied issue of Sniffin' Glue in London after attending the Ramones concert on 4 July 1976 at the Roundhouse. Punk zines were produced in many European countries in subsequent years. The first Irish one was published in March 1977. In Australia in 1977, inspired by the Saints and Radio Birdman, Bruce Milne and Clinton Walker fused their respective first zines Plastered Press and Suicide Alley to launch Pulp; Milne later went on to invent the cassette zine with Fast Forward, in 1980. =1980s= British and American punk zines, 1994‚Äì2004. The politically charged Maximum RocknRoll and the anarchist Profane Existence were notable punkzines that were founded in the 1980s. By that time, most local punk scenes had at least one punkzine. The magazine Factsheet Five chronicled thousands of underground publications and \\"zines\\" in the 1980s and 1990s. In the 1980s, the punk self-publication scene was quickly expanding to include numerous different subcultures within the genre. For example, the birth of the Queercore movement: inspired by the desire for social change, the subculture was represented by zines that sought to accept those within the LGBT community who were also involved in punk and also had overwhelming themes of promoting individual rights. The topics discussed in the issues often ignited forums and chatrooms where readers could share their opinions. This genre of zine was self-sustaining and produced in a DIY manner. Queercore is often accredited to a Toronto-based zine entitled J.D.s, an abbreviation for \\"juvenile delinquents\\", created by G.B. Jones and co-published with Bruce LaBruce. J.D.s was a cut-and-paste-style zine that featured manifestos and dialogue about identifying as queer within the realms of the punk community. Other zines that instigated this movement are Chainsaw (punk zine), Outpunk, and Homocore. The queercore zines influenced the Riot Grrrl zines of the late 1980s and 1990s, as well. =Riot Grrrl zines= The \\"Riot Grrrl\\" movement emerged from the punk scene in the United States when women began to produce zines with feminist themes. The \\"riot grrrl\\" wave was influential for pinkzines as it called for females to publish and produce content in the male dominated culture. Featuring political issues from a personal standpoint, the zines arose in popularity amongst the underground world of punk. The format of the \\"riot grrrl\\" zines was similar to that of queercore zines, in that they were cut and paste and xeroxed with many featuring collages. Self-published punkzines from this era such as Bikini Kill, Girl Germs, and Jigsaw were put out by members of riot grrrl bands who supported the notion of women learning to play music and feeling self-empowered. Other apparent themes in this category of zine include activism, social change, sexuality, body image, and the discussion of controversial topics such as racism and abuse.

Brewer, Peace processes: a sociological approach, p. 7, Polity Press, 2010 He was the main founder of the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO) in 1959 and served as its first director until 1970. He also established the Journal of Peace Research in 1964. In 1969 he was appointed to the world's first chair in peace and conflict studies, at the University of Oslo. He resigned his Oslo professorship in 1977 and has since held professorships at several other universities; from 1993 to 2000 he taught as Distinguished Professor of Peace Studies at the University of Hawaii. He has been based in Kuala Lumpur, where he was the first Tun Mahathir Professor of Global Peace at the International Islamic University Malaysia until 2015. Galtung has been a major intellectual figure of the New Left since the 1950s.Egil B√∏rre Johnsen, Trond Berg Eriksen, Norsk litteraturhistorie 1920‚Äì1995, p. 293, Universitetsforlaget, 1998, He is known for contributions to sociology in the 1950s, political science in the 1960s, economics and history in the 1970s, and macrohistory, anthropology and theology in the 1980s. Galtung coined the term \\"peace research.\\"PRIO Stories He has developed several influential theories, such as the distinction between positive and negative peace, structural violence, theories on conflict and conflict resolution, the concept of peacebuilding, the structural theory of imperialism, and the theory of the United States as simultaneously a republic and an empire.\\"Johan Galtung\\", Norsk Biografisk Leksikon He has often been critical of western countries in their attitude to the Global South. He was awarded the Right Livelihood Award in 1987 for \\"his systematic and multidisciplinary study of the conditions which can lead to peace\\" and has received many other prizes and accolades. Background Galtung speaking at the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, Mexico City. Galtung was born in Oslo. He earned the cand. real. degree in mathematics at the University of Oslo in 1956, and a year later completed the mag. art. (PhD) degree in sociology at the same university. Galtung received the first of thirteen honorary doctorates in 1975. Galtung's father and paternal grandfather were both physicians. The Galtung name has its origins in Hordaland, where his paternal grandfather was born. Nevertheless, his mother, Helga Holmboe, was born in central Norway, in Tr√∏ndelag, while his father was born in √òstfold, in the south. Galtung has been married twice, and has two children by his first wife Ingrid Eide, Harald Galtung and Andreas Galtung, and two by his second wife Fumiko Nishimura, Irene Galtung and Fredrik Galtung. Career Upon receiving his mag. art. degree, Galtung moved to Columbia University, in New York City, where he taught for five semesters as an assistant professor in the Department of Sociology.Life of Johan Galtung (in Danish) In 1959, Galtung returned to Oslo, where he founded the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO). He served as the institute's director until 1969, and saw the institute develop from a department within the Norwegian Institute of Social Research into an independent research institute with enabling funds from the Norwegian Ministry of Education. In 1964, Galtung led PRIO to establish the first academic journal devoted to Peace Studies: the Journal of Peace Research. In the same year, he assisted in the founding of the International Peace Research Association.History of the IPRA In 1969 he left PRIO for a position as professor of peace and conflict research at the University of Oslo, a position he held until 1978. He then served as the director general of the International University Centre in Dubrovnik, as well as helping to found and serving as the president of the World Future Studies Federation.(E. Boulding 1982: 323) He has also held visiting positions at other universities, including Santiago, Chile, the United Nations University in Geneva, and at Columbia, Princeton and the University of Hawaii.Dagens Nyheter 2003-01-15. He has served at so many universities that he has \\"probably taught more students on more campuses around the world than any other contemporary sociologist\\". Galtung is currently teaching courses in the Human Science Department at Saybrook University. In December 2010, Galtung gave a lecture entitled \\"Breaking the Cycle of Violent Conflict\\" at the University of San Diego's Joan B. Kroc Institute for Peace & Justice Distinguished Lecture Series. Galtung is a prolific researcher, having made contributions to many fields in sociology. He has published more than 1000 articles and over 100 books.TRANSCEND biography on Johan Galtung Economist and fellow peace researcher Kenneth Boulding has said of Galtung that his \\"output is so large and so varied that it is hard to believe that it comes from a human\\".(K. Boulding 1977: 75) He is a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters. In 2014 he was appointed as the first Tun Mahathir Professor of Global Peace at the International Islamic University Malaysia. The chair is supported by the Perdana Global Peace Foundation and is named for its founder and chairman, Malaysia's fourth prime minister Mahathir Mohamad. The aim of the chair is to \\"create greater awareness, promotion and advocacy of global peace including the protection of human rights and criminalization of war.\\"TUN MAHATHIR PERDANA GLOBAL PEACE FOUNDATION (PGPF) CHAIR FOR GLOBAL PEACE, International Islamic University Malaysia Mediation for peace Galtung experienced World War II in German-occupied Norway, and as a 12-year- old saw his father arrested by the Nazis. By 1951 he was already a committed peace mediator, and elected to do 18 months of social service in place of his obligatory military service. After 12 months, Galtung insisted that the remainder of his social service be spent in activities relevant to peace, to which the Norwegian authorities responded by sending him to prison, where he served six months. Because Galtung's academic research is clearly intended to promote peace, in 1957, after mediating in Charlottesville, his sociological work shifted toward more concrete and constructive peace mediation. In 1993, he co-founded TRANSCEND: A Peace Development Environment Network,Transcend.org an organization for conflict transformation by peaceful means. There are four traditional but unsatisfactory ways in which conflicts between two parties are handled: # A wins, B loses; # B wins, A loses; # the solution is postponed because neither A nor B feels ready to end the conflict; # a confused compromise is reached, which neither A nor B are happy with. Galtung tries to break with these four unsatisfactory ways of handling a conflict by finding a \\"fifth way\\", where both A and B feel that they win, when both give in expecting nothing but peace. This method also insists that basic human needs ‚Äì such as survival, physical well-being, liberty, and identity ‚Äì be respected. Major ideas Galtung first conceptualized peacebuilding by calling for systems that would create sustainable peace. The peacebuilding structures needed to address the root causes of conflict and support local capacity for peace management and conflict resolution.PEACEBUILDING & THE UNITED NATIONS Peacebuilding Support Office, United Nations Galtung has held several significant positions in international research councils and has been an advisor to several international organisations. Since 2004 he has been a member of the Advisory Council of the Committee for a Democratic UN. He has also written many empirical and theoretical articles, dealing most frequently with issues of peace and conflict research. His work is distinguished by his unique perspective as well as the importance he attributes to innovation and interdisciplinarity. He is one of the authors of an influential account of news values which are the factors which determine what coverage is given to what stories in the news. Galtung also originated the concept of Peace Journalism, which is increasingly influential in communications and media studies. Galtung is strongly associated with the following concepts: * Structural violence ‚Äì widely defined as the systematic ways in which a regime prevents individuals from achieving their full potential. Institutionalized racism and sexism are examples of this. * Negative vs. positive peace ‚Äì popularized the concept that peace may be more than just the absence of overt violent conflict (negative peace), and will likely include a range of relationships up to a state where nations (or any groupings in conflict) might have collaborative and supportive relationships (positive peace). Though he did not cite them, these terms were, in fact, previously defined and discussed in 1907 by Jane Addams and in 1963 by Martin Luther King Jr. * Conflict triangle He has also distinguished himself in public debates concerning, among other things, less-developed countries, defence issues, and the Norwegian EU debate. In 1987 he was given the Right Livelihood Award. He developed the TRANSCEND Method described above. Economist and fellow peace researcher Kenneth Boulding has said of Galtung that his \\"output is so large and so varied that it is hard to believe that it comes from a human\\". =United States as a republic and empire= For Johan Galtung, the US is simultaneously a republic and an empire, a distinction he believes is highly relevant. The US is on one hand loved for its republican qualities, and on the other loathed by its enemies abroad for its perceived military aggressions. Its republican qualities include its work ethic and dynamism, productivity and creativity, the idea of freedom, or liberty, and a pioneering spirit. On the other hand, its military and political manipulation are censured for their aggressiveness, arrogance, violence, hypocrisy and self-righteousness, as well as the US public ignorance of other cultures and extreme materialism.Article by Dr Zeki Ergas \\"Out of Sync with the world: Some Thoughts on the Coming Decline and Fall of the American Empire\\". In 1973, Galtung criticised the \\"structural fascism\\" of the US and other Western countries that make war to secure materials and markets, stating: \\"Such an economic system is called capitalism, and when it's spread in this way to other countries it's called imperialism\\", and has praised Fidel Castro for \\"break[ing] free of imperialism's iron grip\\". Galtung has stated that the US is a \\"killer country\\" guilty of \\"neo-fascist state terrorism\\" and compared the US to Nazi Germany for bombing Kosovo during the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.The Peace Racket by Bruce Bawer, City Journal, Summer 2007. According to Galtung, the US empire causes \\"unbearable suffering and resentment\\" because the \\"exploiters/ killers/ dominators/ alienators, and those who support the US Empire because of perceived benefits\\" are engaging in \\"unequal, non-sustainable, exchange patterns\\". In an article published in 2004, Galtung predicted that the US empire will \\"decline and fall\\" by 2020. He expanded on this hypothesis in his 2009 book titled The Fall of the US Empire - and Then What? Successors, Regionalization or Globalization? US Fascism or US Blossoming?. Russia Today.On the Coming Decline and Fall of the US Empire by Johan Galtung, Transnational Foundation and Peace and Research (TFF), January 28, 2004. However, the decline of the US empire did not imply a decline of the US republic, and the \\"relief from the burden of Empire control and maintenance...could lead to a blossoming of the US Republic\\". Elaborating on the radio and television program Democracy Now, he stated that he loved the American republic and hated the American empire. He added that many Americans had thanked him for this statement on his lecture tours, because it helped them resolve the conflict between their love for their country and their displeasure with its foreign policy.Galtung on Democracy Now, 2010 =Predictions= Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Galtung has made several predictions of when the United States will no longer be a superpower, a stance that has attracted some controversy. In an article published in 2004, he lists 14 'contradictions' that would cause the 'decline and fall' of the US empire. After the beginning of the Iraq War, he revised his prediction of the \\"downfall of the US-Empire\\", seeing it as more imminent.Amerikas imperium g√•r under innen 2020 Adressa September 23, 2004. He claims the US will go through a phase as a fascist dictatorship on its path down, and that the Patriot Act is a symptom of this. He claims the election of George W. Bush cost the US empire five years ‚Äì although he admits that this estimate was set a bit arbitrarily. He now sets the date for the end of the American Empire at 2020, but not the American Republic. Like Great Britain, Russia and France, he says the American Republic will be better off without the Empire. Criticism ;Criticism by Bruce Bawer and Barbara Kay During the course of his career, some of Galtung statements and views have drawn criticism, most notably his criticism of Western countries during and after the Cold War and what his critics perceived as a positive attitude to the Soviet Union, Cuba and Communist China. A 2007 article by Bruce Bawer published in City Journal magazine and a subsequent article in February 2009 by Barbara Kay in the National PostBarbarians within the gate by Barbara Kay, National Post, February 18, 2009. criticised some of Galtung's statements, including his opinion that while Communist China was \\"repressive in a certain liberal sense\\", Mao Zedong was \\"endlessly liberating when seen from many other perspectives that liberal theory has never understood\\". Calling Galtung a \\"lifelong enemy of freedom\\", Bawer claimed that Galtung discouraged Hungarian resistance against the Soviet invasion in 1956, and criticized his description in 1974 of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Andrei Sakharov as \\"persecuted elite personages\\". ;Statements on Israeli influence on United States politics The Israeli newspaper Haaretz accused Galtung in May 2012 of antisemitism for (1) suggesting the possibility of a link between the 2011 Norway attacks and Israel's intelligence agency Mossad; (2) maintaining that \\"six Jewish companies\\" control 96% of world media; (3) identifying what he contends are ironic similarities between the banking firm Goldman Sachs and the conspiratorial antisemitic forgery The Protocols of the Elders of Zion; and (4) theorizing that although not justified, antisemitism in post‚ÄìWorld War I Germany was a predictable consequence of German Jews holding influential positions. As a result of such statements, in May 2012 TRANSCEND International, an organisation co-founded by Galtung, released a statement attempting to clarify his opinions. On August 8, 2012, the World Peace Academy in Basel, Switzerland announced it was suspending Galtung from its organization, citing what it posited were his \\"reckless and offensive statements to questions that are specifically sensitive for Jews.\\" Galtung himself has vehemently repudiated the above attacks as \\"smearing and libel\\" in a published statement and a public lecture at the end of the year 2012.

Galtung was a Norwegian noble family dating from the ennoblement of Lauritz Galtung in 1648. However, when he was ennobled, documents exist that indicate that the family descended from an older noble family, the Galte family. A male-lineage connection between these two families has not been identified, but a female-line linkage bridging between them has been documented in genealogical records. Painted glass (~1636) found on Torsnes farm. The old family, Galte The first family called Galte, belongs to what was called the uradel (i.e., undocumented as nobility by letters of patent, but widely recognized as nobility in other sources) in the middle ages. The Galte family male-line apparently died out in ~1413. They had their main seat at Torsnes in Jondal, Hardanger. It is believed that the descendants living today represent the oldest surviving noble family in Norway. The present family, Galtung Admiral Lauritz Galtung (c. 1615-1661) The existing Galtung family male-line can be traced back to Laurits Johanneson who was born around 1519. It was his great-grandson Lauritz Galtung, Admiral of the Dano- Norwegian fleet, who later renewed the nobility of the family in 1648, changing the name from Galte to Galtung. The present family belonged to an influential circle of families in the Hardanger area, including the owners of the farms Aga and Torsnes, and had many well-known naval officers, including admirals . In 1885, historian Henrik J√∏rgen Huitfeldt-Kaas said that in the period 1670-1870 the family started marrying commoners, and thus, should be considered to have lost their nobility (later it was asserted that this position was influenced by the Danish, whose nobility, to a large degree, supplanted Norwegian nobility during the Dano-Norwegian period. Early in the 18th century the remaining family lived on the old family farm of Torsnes, which is still occupied by descendants today. By the end of the 18th century, many of the family's members could be found in the cities, populating professional classes as lawyers, doctors and such. Living descendants today include sociologist Johan Galtung, recognised for his contributions to peace research and practice of conflict-solving, the so-called transcend-method.

This endemic canid became extinct in 1876, the first known canid to have become extinct in historical times. Traditionally it had been supposed that the most closely related genus was Lycalopex, including the culpeo, which has been introduced to the Falkland Islands in modern times. However, in 2009, a cladistic analysis of DNA identified the Falkland Island wolf's closest living relative as the maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus)‚Äîan unusually long-legged, fox-like South American canid, from which it separated about 6.7 million years ago. However, it diverged from its mainland relative Dusicyon avus very recently, around 16,000 years ago. Dusicyon avus persisted on the South American mainland until around 400 years ago. The Falkland Islands wolf existed on both West and East Falkland, but Charles Darwin was uncertain if they were differentiated varieties. Its fur had a tawny colour and the tip of the tail was white. Its diet is unknown, but, due to the absence of native rodents on the Falklands, probably consisted of ground-nesting birds such as geese and penguins, seal pups, and insects, as well as seashore scavenging. It has sometimes been said that it may have lived in burrows. History Skull The first recorded sighting was by Capt. John Strong in 1690. Captain Strong took one of the animals on his ship, but during the voyage back to Europe the creature became frightened by the firing of the ship's cannon and jumped overboard. Louis Antoine de Bougainville, who established the first settlement in the Falkland Islands termed it a loup-renard (\\"wolf-fox\\"). The name \\"warrah\\" is a corruption of the term aguar√° (meaning \\"fox\\" in Guaran√≠, a Native American language), because of its similarity to the maned wolf (aguar√° guaz√∫). The warrah's Latin name translates into \\"foolish dog of the south\\", because of its apparent lack of fear of people. The Falkland Island wolf was hunted for its fur. When Charles Darwin visited the islands in 1833 he found the species present in both West and East Falkland and tame. However, at the time of his visit the animal was already very rare on East Falkland, and even on West Falkland its numbers were declining rapidly. By 1865, it was no longer found on the eastern part of East Falkland. He predicted that the animal would join the dodo among the extinct within \\"a very few years.\\" It was hunted for its valuable fur, and the settlers, regarding the wolf as a threat to their sheep, poisoned it. However, the belief that Falkland Islands wolf was a threat to sheep was probably due to the sheep mistaking the Falkland Islands wolves for dogs (especially at night), and, in terror, the sheep ran into bogs and swamps, where they became lost. There were no forests for the animal to hide in, and it had no fear of humans; it was possible to lure the animal with a chunk of meat held in one hand, and kill it with a knife or stick held in the other. However, it would defend itself occasionally if it needed to, as Admiral George Grey noted when they landed on West Falkland at Port Edgar on 17 December 1836: A live wolf was taken to London Zoo, England in 1868. Another \\"Antarctic wolf\\" arrived in 1870. Neither animal survived long. Only a dozen or so museum specimens exist today. In 1880, after the animal became extinct, Thomas Huxley classified it as related to the coyote. In 1914, Oldfield Thomas moved it to the genus Dusicyon, with the culpeo and other South American foxes. (These other canids have since been removed to Lycalopex.) =Darwin's description= Darwin writing about his 1834 visit to the Falklands in his Journal and Remarks (The Voyage of the Beagle) has the following to say of Canis antarcticus: File:FalklandIslandFox2.jpgJohn Gerrard Keulemans File:Falklandwolf Dusicyon culpaeus.jpgZoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle File:Dusicyon antarcticus - Smith - Iconographia Zoologica.pngH. Smith File:Illustrated London News (1873) Antarctic Wolf.jpgThe Illustrated London News (1873) Biogeography and evolution =Darwin's comments= When organising his notes on the last stage of the Beagle expedition, Darwin wrote of his growing suspicions that the differences between the various Gal√°pagos Islands mockingbirds and tortoises, as well as the possible dissimilarity of West Falkland and East Falkland Islands wolves, were but variants that differed depending on which island they came from: The word \\"would\\" was added after this passage was first written, suggesting a cautious qualification from his initial bold statement. He later wrote that such facts \\"seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of species\\". = Related species = A DNA analysis and a study of comparative brain anatomy suggest that the closest living relative of the Falkland Islands wolf is the South American maned wolf. Their most recent common ancestor was estimated to have lived some 6 million years ago and was close to the most recent common ancestor of all South American canids, Eucyon or a close relative. It would seem that the lineages of the maned wolf and the Falkland Islands wolf separated in North America; canids did not appear in South America until roughly 3 million years ago in a paleozoogeographical event called the Great American Biotic Interchange, in which the continents of North and South America were newly connected by the formation of the Isthmus of Panama. However, no fossil from North America can be assigned to the Falkland Islands wolf or its immediate ancestors. Dusicyon avus, known from fossils from southern South America as recent as 1,600 years ago, was a close mainland relative of the Falkland Islands wolf. In terms of skull shape and feeding habits, the animal was an opportunistic predator, more like a jackal. =Biogeographical isolation on the Falklands= The route by which the Falkland Islands wolf was established in the islands was unknown for a long time, as the islands have never been connected to the mainland see figure 3 and there are no other native land mammals.But even though the study has gone some way to clarifying the evolutionary origins of the Falklands wolf, the species still represents a great bio-geographical conundrum because the Falklands have never been connected to the South American mainland and no other land mammals ‚Äì not even small rodents ‚Äì have managed to live there. No other oceanic island as remote as the Falklands has a native canid; the island fox of California in the US and Darwin's fox of Chile both inhabit islands much closer to a continent. Berta and other authors suggest that it was unlikely that the wolf's ancestors could have survived the last Ice Age on the Falklands and they must therefore have arrived later, within the last ten thousand years, crossing a wide expanse of the South Atlantic.Berta, A. (1987). Origin, diversification, and zoogeography of the South American Canidae. Fieldiana: Zoology, 39, 455‚Äì471 Its close relative, Dusicyon avus, did survive in South America until a few thousand years ago, but swimming such a distance or even drifting on a floating log would appear effectively impossible for the wolf. Some speculated that the species had originally arrived with indigenous peoples visiting the islands after the settlement of the Americas, having been kept by them in a semi-domesticated state. There is, however, no definite evidence that humans ever visited the Falklands before the Age of Discovery (the islands are not visible from the mainland, and traveling to the Falklands in open canoes would have been very difficult and extremely dangerous) nor is there any evidence that the ancestors of the wolf were ever domesticated. DNA of the extinct mainland relative, D. avus, analyzed in 2013 suggests that its genetic history diverged from the Falkland Islands wolf only some 16,000 years ago, during the last glacial phase. This is strong evidence that the ancestors of the wolf were isolated on the islands only since the last glacial maximum. A 2009 analysis of mitochondrial DNA from five museum specimens of the Falkland Islands wolf indicated that they had multiple mitochondrial haplotypes whose most recent common ancestor lived about 330,000 years ago, giving some idea of the genetic diversity of the founding population. An Ice Age land bridge or ice connection between the Falkland Islands and South America, enabling the species' ancestors to traverse the gap, has long been suggested. There was never a true land bridge between the islands and South America, but submarine terraces have been found on the Argentine coastal shelf, formed by low sea-stands during the last glacial phase. This suggests that there was a shallow strait as narrow as 20 km, which may have frozen completely at times. It seems likely that the founding population of the wolf crossed on this ice bridge during the last Ice Age. This would explain the absence of other mainland mammals on the islands; an ice crossing is much more difficult than crossing a land bridge.

The prototypes were developed as part of the Objective Individual Combat Weapon program in the 1990s. The term SABR (Selectable Assault Battle Rifle) was also used at certain points, but is less common. Overview Developed by Alliant Techsystems, with Heckler & Koch as a major subcontractor, the most commonly seen version of the XM29 consisted of a semi-automatic 20√ó28mm smart grenade launcher, an underslung \\"KE\\" assault carbine (derived from the HK G36 then in its late developmental stage) firing a standard 5.56√ó45mm NATO round, and a top-mounted computer-assisted sighting system with integrated laser rangefinder, thermal vision night vision capabilities, and up to 6√ó optical telescopic sight. Earlier designs used different configurations and setups. The launcher part has been described variously as a light semi-automatic 20 mm cannon, a grenade launcher, or an airburst weapon. It poses a classification problem, in that it does not fit neatly into any one category. On one hand, it uses much smaller shells and has a much flatter trajectory than grenade launchers. On the other, while its caliber and velocity is more similar to light cannon, it does share traits with other infantry grenade launchers. Various problems have effectively ended the program as it was originally envisioned, including weight, bulk, and lack of effectiveness of the 20√ó28 mm airburst round. Upon cancellation in 2004, it was split into three related programs. OICW Increment One is a program to develop a family of light kinetic energy weapons, OICW Increment Two is a program to develop the airburst grenade launcher as a standalone component, and OICW Increment Three is a program to re-integrate the two components. The XM8 was developed in an attempt to meet Increment One requirements. Instead a new program known as Lightweight Small Arms Technologies (LSAT) was begun. Meanwhile, the XM25 25√ó40mm airburst launcher began development to meet the Increment Two requirements. Increment Three will not be initiated until after One and Two are completed. The OICW Increment One Request for Proposals was cancelled in October 2005, while development of the 25√ó40mm XM25 continued, and the 25√ó59mm OCSW program as well until its termination. It is not clear if LSAT is intended to meet the goals of OICW Increment One or if it is a standalone weapon system. However, for all intents and purposes, the OICW program is no longer under development.

Costa Rica used to have a two-party system, which meant that there were two dominant political parties, the Social Christian Unity Party and the National Liberation Party, with extreme difficulty for anybody to achieve electoral success under the banner of any other party. After the 2002 elections and the strong showing of the brand-new Citizens' Action Party, it was considered very likely that the old two-party system was on the verge of giving way to a multi-party system. Several other parties have gained prominence since then, and the 2006 elections made it clear that Costa Rica is now a multi-party system. Starting in the 2000s, disagreement about many of the neo-liberal policies promoted by the dominant PLN caused the traditional party system of alliances among a few parties to fracture. Although still a stable country, the shift toward many political parties and away from PUSC and PLN is a recent development. Various elected positions within the country, such as mayors and city council members, are held by many different national and local political parties.

The two traditionally largest parties, Fianna F√°il and Fine Gael, arose from a split in the original Sinn F√©in, Fine Gael from the faction (Cumann na nGaedheal) that supported the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty and Fianna F√°il from the anti-Treaty faction. The division on the Treaty had also caused the Irish Civil War (1922‚Äì23), leading to the difference between the parties being described as \\"Civil War politics\\", to distinguish it from a more common left-right political divide. As of the 2020 general election, Fianna F√°il and Sinn F√©in are joint first parties in party representation in D√°il √âireann, while Fine Gael is a close third behind them. The Green Party surpassed the Labour Party in the same general election. The Labour Party was formed in 1912, and it had usually been the third party in parliamentary strength, though it is currently the joint fifth party with the Social Democrats. Political party registration is governed by the Electoral Acts, 1992 to 2012. The Register of Political Parties is maintained by the Houses of the Oireachtas. In order to be registered to contest national elections a party must have either at least one member in D√°il √âireann or the European Parliament, or 300 recorded members aged 18 or over. Parties that register only to contest elections in part of the state, in local elections or in elections to √ödar√°s na Gaeltachta need only 100 recorded members aged 18 or over. In either case at least half of the recorded members must be on the register of electors. Political parties with representation at a local, national or European level =Party details= =Party representation= Parties and groupings represented in the Oireachtas =Fianna F√°il= Fianna F√°il is the joint largest party in the D√°il and has the largest number of city and county council seats. It has been in government more than any other party: 1932‚Äì1948, 1951‚Äì1954, 1957‚Äì1973, 1977‚Äì1981, 1982, 1987‚Äì1994, and 1997‚Äì2011, and 2020 to date. On all occasions up to 1989, it was in a single- party government; on all occasions since then it was the leading party in a coalition government. It is a member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party and is led by Taoiseach Miche√°l Martin. It was founded in 1926 by √âamon de Valera as a radical anti-Treaty party, drawing support from small farmers and urban workers but has since become a party of the establishment. It was first elected to power in 1932 on a constitutional republican platform, promising to remove constitutional links with Britain and reduce poverty by creating employment. It oversaw much of the industrial development of the Republic and has consequently drawn support from all social classes, making it a classic populist party. Fianna F√°il has 37 TDs, 20 Senators, 2 MEPs and 276 councillors. =Sinn F√©in= Sinn F√©in is the joint largest party in the D√°il and the second-largest party in the Northern Assembly. The name Sinn F√©in, meaning 'ourselves', has been used by a number of political organisations in Ireland since 1905, when first used by Arthur Griffith. Sinn F√©in was the party of separatism before Irish independence, and broke through in the Westminster election of 1918, where it won 73 of the 105 Irish seats. The modern-day Sinn F√©in party emerged in 1970 after a split in the party, and was often distinguished as Provisional Sinn F√©in. It was closely linked to the Provisional Irish Republican Army. It is led by Mary Lou McDonald. Sinn F√©in has 37 TDs, 5 Senators, 1 MEP and 80 councillors in the Republic of Ireland. =Fine Gael= Fine Gael is the third largest party in the D√°il, the second largest party in local government in Ireland and has the largest delegation of MEPs from Ireland. It was founded in 1933 by a merger of the Cumann na nGaedheal, which had supported the Treaty and formed the government between 1922 and 1932, the National Guard (popularly called the Blueshirts) and the small National Centre Party. It is a member of the centre- right European People's Party and is led by T√°naiste Leo Varadkar. It has been in government in the periods 1922‚Äì1932, 1948‚Äì1951, 1954‚Äì1957, 1973‚Äì1977, 1981‚Äì1982, 1982‚Äì1987, 1994‚Äì1997, and 2011‚Äì2020. On each occasion until 2016, it was the leading party of a coalition with the Labour Party, and in three of those cases also with other smaller parties. At the 2011 general election, Fine Gael became the largest party in the Oireachtas with 36.1% of the vote. Fine Gael has 35 TDs, 16 Senators, 5 MEPs and 255 councillors. =Green Party= The Green Party was established in 1981 and is allied to the European Green Party. The Green Party of Northern Ireland voted in 2005 to become a region of the Irish Green Party making it the second party to be organised on an all-Ireland basis. It has Northern Ireland members on the Irish Green Party national executive. In June 2007, the Green Party entered coalition government with Fianna F√°il and the Progressive Democrats. In January 2011 they left the coalition, and at the 2011 general election, lost all of their D√°il seats. In the 2020 election, they gained over (10 including their by-election win in 2019) 9 TDs for the first time in its history and becoming the fourth position in parliamentary strength. The Green Party has 12 TDs, 4 Senators, 2 MEPs and 49 councillors. =Labour Party= The Labour Party is a social democratic party, founded in 1912 as part of the trade union movement, with which it maintains organisational links. For most of the history of the state, it was the third largest party, though it is currently in fifth position in parliamentary strength. It has been in government in the periods 1948‚Äì1951, 1954‚Äì1957, 1973‚Äì1977, 1981‚Äì1982, 1982‚Äì1987, 1993‚Äì1994, 1994‚Äì1997, and 2011‚Äì2016. On each of those occasions, it was in coalition with Fine Gael, with the exception of the period 1993 to 1994, when it was in coalition with Fianna F√°il. The Labour Party merged with the smaller Democratic Left party in 1999. It is a member of the Party of European Socialists and is led by Alan Kelly. The Labour Party has 6 TDs, 5 Senators and 57 councillors. =Social Democrats= The Social Democrats were founded in July 2015 by three independent TDs Catherine Murphy, R√≥is√≠n Shortall and, Stephen Donnelly (who has since left the party for Fianna F√°il.) As of June 2020, The Social Democrats have 6 TDs and 19 Councillors. =Solidarity‚ÄìPeople Before Profit= Solidarity‚ÄìPeople Before Profit is an electoral alliance between People Before Profit, Solidarity and RISE. In October 2015, they formed a new alliance for electoral purposes, but continue to organise separately. The founding TDs have stated their aim to build a mass party of the left and ultimately help form a left-wing government. Together they have 5 TDs (three from PBP, one from Solidarity and one from RISE) and 11 councillors. =Aont√∫= Aont√∫ is an all- Ireland republican party with a left-wing economic stance and a conservative social position. It was founded in 2019 by Peadar T√≥ib√≠n who left Sinn F√©in because of its support for the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018. It has 1 TD and 3 councillors in the Republic of Ireland, and 2 councillors in Northern Ireland. =Right To Change= Right To Change was founded in May 2020.

WUA has one councillor. =Workers' Party= The Workers' Party is a Marxist‚ÄìLeninist party allied with the international workers and communist parties. It is organised in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. A special Ardfheis in 1992 designed to re-constitute the party and remove links with the Official IRA resulted in a formal split with the bulk of the parliamentary party and councillors leaving to form Democratic Left. Democratic Left voted to merge with the Labour Party in 1999. The Workers' Party has one councillor on Cork City Council. =Republican Sinn F√©in= Republican Sinn F√©in were formed in 1986 by members of Sinn F√©in who did not support the decision made at the party's ard fheis in that year to end its policy of abstentionism and to allow elected Sinn F√©in TDs take their seats in D√°il √âireann. They have one councillor, Tom√°s √ì Curraoin on Galway County Council. As they are not a registered party, he is officially an independent councillor. =Kerry Independent Alliance= The Kerry Independent Alliance (previously the South Kerry Independent Alliance) have one councillor on Kerry County Council.

Joe Higgins was its first member elected at national level. It was part of the United Left Alliance in the 2011 general election, but that alliance disintegrated over the course of the following D√°il term. It now contests elections as part of the Solidarity‚ÄìPeople Before Profit party. =Socialist Workers Network= The Socialist Workers Network was founded in 1971 as the Socialist Workers Movement. Later known as the Socialist Workers Party (SWP), the party was set up by supporters of the International Socialists of Britain living in Ireland. SWP member Richard Boyd Barrett was elected to the D√°il √âireann, on behalf of People Before Profit, in the 2011 Irish general election. =Renua= Renua was founded in March 2015 with Lucinda Creighton as its founding leader. The founding parliamentary party deputies all left Fine Gael over their opposition to the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013. Renua no longer has any TDs, having lost all three at the 2016 general election. It had one councillor elected at the 2019 local elections, but he resigned from the party shortly after. =Communist Party of Ireland= The Communist Party of Ireland was first founded in 1921, re- founded in 1933 and its current incarnation has its origins in 1970. The party's only national representative was Patrick Gaffney, who contested the 1922 Irish general election as a Labour candidate, but later switched party allegiances.

Parties thus form political alliances and coalition governments. In the 2018 general election three groupings obtained most of the votes and most of the seats in the two houses of the Italian Parliament: a centre-right coalition, composed of the League, Forza Italia, the Brothers of Italy and minor allies; the anti-establishment Five Star Movement; a centre-left coalition, composed of the Democratic Party and minor allies. History Between 1945 and 1994, Italian politics was dominated by two major parties: Christian Democracy, the main party of government, and the Italian Communist Party, the main opposition party. The other opposition party was the post-fascist Italian Social Movement. During its almost fifty years in government, Christian Democracy chose its coalition partners among four parties: the Italian Socialist Party, the Italian Democratic Socialist Party, the Italian Republican Party and the Italian Liberal Party. For 46 consecutive years, the Christian Democrats led the government except for five years. Between 1983 and 1991, they led a coalition government with the Socialists, the Republicans, the Democratic Socialists and the Liberals. That was the time when several northern regional parties demanding autonomy organised themselves at the regional level. In 1991 they federated themselves into the Northern League, which became the country's fourth largest party in the 1992 general election. In 1992‚Äì94, the political system was shaken by a series of corruption scandals known collectively as Tangentopoli. These events led to the disappearance of the five parties of government. Consequently, the Communists, who had evolved to become Democratic Party of the Left in 1991, and the post-fascists, who launched National Alliance in 1994, gained strength. Following the 1994 general election, media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi became Prime Minister at the head of a coalition composed mainly of three parties: his brand-new party Forza Italia (joined by several members of the former mainstream parties), National Alliance and the Northern League. Between 1996 and 2008, Italian political parties were organised into two big coalitions, the centre-right Pole for Freedoms (which was renamed House of Freedoms after the re-entry of the Northern League in 2000) and The Olive Tree (part of the new, broader coalition The Union in 2005) on the centre-left. The latter governed from 1996 to 2001 and again between 2006 and 2008, while the House of Freedoms was in government between 2001 and 2006. In 2008 The Union ceased to exist as the newly-founded Democratic Party decided to break the alliance with its left-wing partners, notably including the Communist Refoundation Party. On the centre-right, Forza Italia and National Alliance merged to form The People of Freedom, which continued the alliance with the Northern League and won the 2008 general election. In the 2013 general election the party system was fragmented in four groupings: the centre-left composed of the Democratic Party and Left Ecology Freedom; the traditional centre-right alliance between The People of Freedom and the Northern League; Beppe Grillo's Five Star Movement; and a new centrist coalition around Mario Monti's Civic Choice. In November 2013 The People of Freedom was dissolved and merged into the new Forza Italia, provoking the split of the New Centre-Right. In December 2016 Left Ecology Freedom was dissolved in order to take part to the formation of Italian Left. In February 2017 splinters from the Democratic Party and Italian Left launched the Article One, while in March the New Centre-Right was transformed into Popular Alternative. In the 2018 general election the major groupings were reduced to three: the centre-right composed of the Northern League (which was the coalition's largest party for the first time), Forza Italia, Brothers of Italy and minor allies; the Five Star Movement (which was the most voted party); the centre-left composed of the Democratic Party and minor allies. Free and Equal, a new left-wing joint list whose main members were Article One and Italian Left, came a distant fourth.

The series follows a fictional Japanese branch of a secret global organization called \\"SOLOMON\\" or the \\"Solomon Toukatsu Nin'idantai\\" (roughly \\"Solomon Executive Organization\\"), abbreviated as \\"STN\\" or \\"STN-J\\". Solomon fights the harmful use of witchcraft using a database of witches, which includes those who have obtained the power of witchcraft through genetics and others who carry the gene (called \\"seeds\\") in order to arrest or eliminate them should their powers \\"awaken\\". The series focuses on one STN-J member, Robin Sena. Plot Robin Sena is a \\"craft user\\", born in Japan and raised by the Roman Catholic Church in Italy. She is trained to use her craft of fire to hunt down witches. Witchcraft is a genetic trait, dormant within a number of individuals within the human population. Powers can be \\"awakened\\" in these dormant human \\"seeds\\" at any time, which seems to also drive the awakened witch into various forms of homicidal madness or sociopathy. Trained hunters, craft-users or \\"seeds\\" themselves that have not become full witches, are needed to keep watch over \\"seeds\\" and hunt those whose abilities become active, serving in secret organizations, such as the parent branch \\"Solomon\\" and the \\"STN-J\\" branch in Japan, as self-appointed witch police to curtail the use of witchcraft in society, and to keep the witch kind a secret from the public. Even the police, who cooperate with STN-J in abnormal criminal cases, do not know what STN-J does. The series begins when Robin arrives in Japan to gain information for Solomon headquarters about a fabled item that holds the \\"secrets of the craft,\\" while acting undercover as a new hunter to the STN-J in their efforts to capture witches. \\"Orbo\\" is a green liquid that negates witch abilities. STN-J's hunters carry small vials of it on necklaces in the shape of a cross as a form of protection against their targets' craft. Hunters also carry air pistols which fire darts or pellets of Orbo that dampen witch powers when it enters the bloodstream of the target witch. Hunters who are craft-users or seeds can use Orbo without ill effects, although their own powers are reportedly diminished while using it. Robin, a craft-user herself, declines to use Orbo because she feels it is \\"disgusting\\". As the series goes on, Robin grows increasingly uncomfortable with her role in hunting and capturing other witches. She begins to question the treatment they receive while incarcerated in the mysterious \\"Factory\\". After the discovery of \\"secrets of the craft,\\" she is entrapped and attacked twice by \\"witch bullets\\". Subsequently, the STN-J is attacked, presumably for \\"secrets of the craft,\\" although the Solomon attack was carried out to find what Zaizen, the director of the STN-J, was planning. Robin begins to worry that she will become a target and grows to suspect that her partner Amon will hunt her. Eventually, Robin does become a target of Solomon and labeled a witch, becoming \\"hunted\\". In the end, Robin finds out more about her craft and that of witches than she knew at the beginning. Initially, the series appears to take a \\"monster of the week\\" approach. About halfway through the 26-episode season, the characters and the relationships between them are established and the main plot gets underway. Characters Media =Anime= The TV series was produced by Sunrise and Bandai Visual and directed by Sh≈´k≈ç Murase, with Aya Yoshinaga serving the role of chief writer, Kumiko Takahashi designing the characters and Taku Iwasaki composing the music. The series originally aired across Japan between July 2, 2002 and December 24, 2002 on TV Tokyo and Animax, which later broadcast the series across its respective networks worldwide, including East Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and other regions. The series was licensed for North American distribution by Bandai Entertainment. In October 2003, it debuted at the 3rd Annual Metreon Festival of Anime in San Francisco, followed by a Q&A; and autograph session from Kari Wahlgren, who provided the voice for the title character. It was later aired across the United States on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim late-night programming block beginning February 16, 2004 (it was given a second full run on Adult Swim in the Fall of 2004 before the broadcast rights were left to expire). It has also been aired across Canada on YTV's Bionix block from September 10, 2004. Following the closure of Bandai Entertainment in 2012, Sunrise announced at their at Otakon 2013, that Funimation has rescued the series, along with a handful of other former Bandai Entertainment titles. In the United Kingdom and Ireland the series was broadcast in a daily stripped timeslot on AnimeCentral from January 5 to January 30, 2008, with an immediate rerun from January 31. Soundtrack The music of Witch Hunter Robin was composed by Taku Iwasaki. Both the opening and ending themes were performed by Bana (aka Chino Takayanagi). Two soundtrack CDs have been released by Victor Entertainment. The first Witch Hunter Robin Original Sound Score I was released on September 21, 2002. It contains twenty-three tracks, including TV edits of the opening and ending themes. The second soundtrack Witch Hunter Robin Original Sound Score II was released on November 21, 2002. It also contained twenty-three tracks with a guitar version of the opening theme. A shortened version of this guitar-only theme was used as the ending theme for Episode 15 \\"Time to Say Goodbye\\". A single containing the opening and ending themes and karaoke versions was released on August 21, 2002. =Live action series= On April 5, 2004, the SciFi Channel released a press release stating a listing of new shows and movies in development for the future, one of which was a live action version of Witch Hunter Robin produced by Roy Lee and Doug Davison, who were credited as the producers for the movie The Ring. No premiere date was given. It was later revealed that the live action version developed by Sci-Fi had been dropped from production. Reception The series has received many comments from staff of Anime News Network. Bamboo Dong, a columnist from the website, has stated that she cannot make enough positive comments about the series and that it is \\"a show that everyone must absolutely see\\". She also comments that the ending \\"is a wonderful way to cap off the series\\" and that it retained the series' solid sense of action. However, she comments that the ending moved a little too fast and spent much of its time with plot revelations, missing its chance to give the series \\"that extra kick\\". Carlo Santos praised the series, saying that it was a unique tale that was gorgeous and engrossing to watch and one of 2004's best adventure anime. Ryan Matthews has praised the cast choices in his column, saying that the cast is well-suited to their roles, but the performances were flat. He also notes that the ADR script was filled with clumsy wording and mid-sentence stops. He comments that it seems that the script was written without trying to match the animation. In his review, Zac Bertschy says that the series is highly original and very well executed. Bertschy praises the sound track. He notes that the character designs fit well with series' visual style and the characters' expressions were convincing. Although he says that the slow plot pacing is a more negative point, he points out that action is not the focus and that once the series' picks up, the \\"wait is more than worth it\\". Jason Bustard from T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews comments that the supernatural and spooky undercurrent in the setting would fit perfectly into The X-Files or Millennium television series. The characters are received as a \\"mixed bunch\\". The main cast is said to have \\"distinct and fully rendered personalities\\", all of which are well- done. Character interaction is fun, but characterization sometimes falls into clich√©. In contrast to the review from Anime News Network, Bustard believed that the story moved at a brisk pace. Although he agreed that action fans would find the series dull and added that comedy and romance fans would not enjoy the series either. Tasha Robinson of Sci Fi Channel's Sci Fi Weekly commented that it was difficult to decide whom to \\"root for\\" as the witches seemed to be insane killers, but the protagonists were \\"killers of a colder, more controlled stripe\\" and were generally unpleasant, with the exceptions of Karasuma and Zaizen. She also noted that the characters give no indication as to why they work for the STN. Robin and Amon's character designs are said to be strange. The series' setting was said to be \\"a fairly severe, almost oppressive gothic design\\" and that the color palette and the plot's focus on the occult contributed to the dark feel. The pace steeply picks up once the protagonists head into battle. It is also noted that the series' could have afforded to reveal more information earlier in the series instead of teasing the audience with mysteries; just like many other reviewers, she comments that the mysteries were worth the wait. Witch Hunter Robin placed second on a list of top anime properties for 2004's first quarter and placed sixth for the third quarter.

A changeling was believed to be a fairy child that had been left in place of a human child stolen by the fairies. The theme of the swapped child is common in medieval literature and reflects concern over infants thought to be afflicted with unexplained diseases, disorders, or developmental disabilities. Description A changeling is typically identifiable via a number of traits; in Irish legend, a fairy child may appear sickly and won't grow in size like a normal child, and may have notable physical characteristics such as a beard or long teeth. They may also display intelligence far beyond their apparent years, as well as possess uncanny insight. A common way that a changeling could identify itself is through displaying unusual behaviour when it thinks it's alone, such as jumping about, dancing or playing an instrument ‚Äî though this last example is found only within Irish and Scottish legend. \\"A human child might be taken due to many factors: to act as a servant, the love of a human child, or malice.Katharine Briggs, An Encyclopedia of Fairies, Hobgoblins, Brownies, Boogies, and Other Supernatural Creatures \\"Changelings\\" (Pantheon Books, 1976) p. 71. Most often it was thought that fairies exchanged the children. In rare cases, the very elderly of the fairy people would be exchanged in the place of a human baby, so that the old fairy could live in comfort, being coddled by its human parents.Briggs (1979) Simple charms such as an inverted coat or open iron scissors left where the child sleeps, were thought to ward them off; other measures included a constant watch over the child.\\" D. L. Ashliman points out in his essay 'Changelings' that changeling tales illustrate an aspect of family survival in pre-industrial Europe. A peasant family's subsistence frequently depended upon the productive labour of each member, and it was difficult to provide for a person who was a permanent drain on the family's scarce resources. \\"The fact that the changelings' ravenous appetite is so frequently mentioned indicates that the parents of these unfortunate children saw in their continuing existence a threat to the sustenance of the entire family. Changeling tales support other historical evidence in suggesting that infanticide was frequently the solution selected.\\" Function The devil steals a baby, leaving a concealed changeling. Early 15th century, detail of \\"The legend of St. Stephen\\" by Martino di Bartolomeo One belief is that trolls thought that it was more respectable to be raised by humans and that they wanted to give their own children a human upbringing. Some people believed that trolls would take unbaptised children. Once children had been baptized and therefore become part of the Church, the trolls could not take them. Beauty in human children and young women, particularly traits which evoke brightness or reflectivity, such as blonde hair and blue or silver eyes, are said to attract fairies, as they perhaps find preciousness in these perceived traits.Briggs (1976) \\"Golden Hair\\", p. 194 In Scottish folklore, the children might be replacements for fairy children in the tithe to Hell;Silver (1999) p. 74 this is best known from the ballad of Tam Lin.Francis James Child, ballad 39a \\"Tam Lin\\", The English and Scottish Popular Ballads According to common Scottish myths, a child born with a caul (part of the amniotic membrane) across their face is a changeling, and will soon die (is \\"of fey birth\\"). Other folklore says that human milk is necessary for fairy children to survive. In these cases either the newborn human child would be switched with a fairy baby to be suckled by the human mother, or the human mother would be taken back to the fairy world to breastfeed the fairy babies. It is also thought that human midwives were necessary to bring fairy babies into the world. Some stories tell of changelings who forget they are not human and proceed to live a human life. Changelings who do not forget, however, in some stories return to their fairy family, possibly leaving the human family without warning. The human child that was taken may often stay with the fairy family forever. Feeling connected to the fate of a changeling, there are families who merely turn their changeling loose to the wilderness. Some folklorists believe that fairies were memories of inhabitants of various regions in Europe who had been driven into hiding by invaders. They held that changelings had actually occurred; the hiding people would exchange their own sickly children for the healthy children of the occupying invader.Silver (1999) p. 73 In folklore =Cornwall= The M√™n-an-Tol stones in Cornwall are said to have a fairy or pixie guardian who can make miraculous cures. In one case, a changeling baby was passed through the stone in order for the mother to have her real child returned to her. Evil pixies had changed her child, and the stones were able to reverse their spell.Wentz, W. Y. Evans (1911). The Fairy-Faith in Celtic Countries. Reprinted 1981. Pub. Colin Smythe. P. 179. =Germany= In Germany, the changeling is known as Wechselbalg,Jacob Grimm: Deutsche Mythologie. Wiesbaden 2007, p. 364. Wechselkind,Jacob Grimm: Deutsche Mythologie. Wiesbaden 2007, p. 1039. Kielkopf or Dickkopf (the last both hinting at the huge necks and heads of changelings). Several methods are known in Germany to identify a changeling and to return the replaced real child: * confusing the changeling by cooking or brewing in eggshells. This will force the changeling to speak, claiming its real age, revealing its position beyond synchronicity. * attempting to heat the changeling in the ovenLudwig Bechstein: Deutsches Sagenbuch. Meersburg, Leipzig 1930, p. 142 f. ‚Äì perhaps a lie by capacity to endure present. * hitting or whipping the changeling Sometimes the changeling has to be fed with a woman's milk before replacing the children. In German folklore, several possible parents are known for changelings. Those are: * the devil, a belief shared by Martin LutherAshliman, D. L., \\"Changelings\\", 1997.

Yeats, Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry, in A Treasury of Irish Myth, Legend, and Folklore (1986), p. 47, New York : Gramercy Books, So too was admiring or envying a woman or man dangerous, unless the person added a blessing; the able-bodied and beautiful were in particular danger. Women were especially in danger in liminal states: being a new bride, or a new mother.Silver (1999) p. 167 Putting a changeling in a fire would cause it to jump up the chimney and return the human child, but at least one tale recounts a mother with a changeling finding that a fairy woman came to her home with the human child, saying the other fairies had done the exchange, and she wanted her own baby. The tale of surprising a changeling into speech ‚Äì by brewing eggshells ‚Äì is also told in Ireland, as in Wales.Yeats (1986) p. 48-50 Various legends describe other ways to foil a would-be fairy kidnapper. One was to shout \\"Gairum augus coisricim th√∫ \\" (I bless you) or \\"God bless you,\\" which would cause the fairy to abandon the child it was trying to steal. Another possible tactic was to insert oneself into an argument over who would keep the child; shouting out \\"Give it to me\\" would trick the fairy into releasing the child back to a human. Changelings, in some instances, were regarded not as substituted fairy children but instead old fairies brought to the human world to die. Irish legends regarding changelings typically follow the same formula: a tailor is the one who first notices a changeling, the inclusion of a fairy playing bagpipes or some other instrument, and the kidnapping of a human child through a window. The modern Irish girl's name, Siofra, means an elvish or changeling child, deriving from S√≠obhra(√≠) meaning fairy(/fairies). The Aos s√≠, siabhra (commonly anglicised as \\"sheevra\\"), may be prone to evil and mischief.MacKillop, James (2004) Dictionary of Celtic MythologyJoyce, P.W. A Social History of Ancient Ireland, Vol. 1, p. 271 However, the Ulster folk song 'The Gartan Mother's Lullaby' also uses \\"sheevra\\" simply to mean \\"spirit\\" or \\"fairy\\".\\"The Gartan Mother's Lullaby\\" published 1904 in The Songs of Uladh, lyrics by Seosamh MacCathmhaoil (Joseph Campbell) =The Isle of Man= The Isle of Man had a wide collection of myths and superstitions concerning fairies, and there are numerous folk tales that have been collected concerning supposed changelings. Sophia Morrison, in her \\"Manx Fairy Tales\\" (David Nutt, London, 1911) includes the tale of \\"The Fairy Child of Close ny Lheiy\\", a tale of a child supposedly swapped by the fairies for a loud and unruly fairy child. The English poet and topographer George Waldron, who lived in the Isle of Man during the early 18th century, cites a tale of a reputed changeling that was shown to him, possibly a child with an inherited genetic disorder: \\"Nothing under heaven could have a more beautiful face; but though between five and six years old, and seemingly healthy, he was so far from being able to walk, or stand, that he could not so much as move any one joint; his limbs were vastly long for his age, but smaller than an infant's of six months; his complexion was perfectly delicate, and he had the finest hair in the world; he never spoke, nor cried, ate scarcely anything, and was very seldom seen to smile, but if any one called him a fairy-elf, he would frown and fix his eyes so earnestly on those who said it, as if he would look them through. His mother, or at least his supposed mother, being very poor, frequently went out a-charing, and left him a whole day together. The neighbours, out of curiosity, have often looked in at the window to see how he behaved when alone, which, whenever they did, they were sure to find him laughing and in the utmost delight. This made them judge that he was not without company more pleasing to him than any mortal's could be; and what made this conjecture seem the more reasonable was, that if he were left ever so dirty, the woman at her return saw him with a clean face, and his hair combed with the utmost exactness and nicety.\\" =Lowland Scotland and Northern England= In the Anglo-Scottish border region it was believed that elves (or fairies) lived in \\"elf hills\\" (or \\"fairy hills\\"). Along with this belief in supernatural beings was the view that they could spirit away children, and even adults, and take them back to their own world (see Elfhame).Folklore of Northumbria by Fran and Geoff Doel, The History Press, 2009, . Pages. 17‚Äì27. Often, it was thought, a baby would be snatched and replaced with a simulation of the baby, usually a male adult elf, to be suckled by the mother. The real baby would be treated well by the elves and would grow up to be one of them, whereas the changeling baby would be discontented and wearisome. Many herbs, salves and seeds could be used for discovering the fairy-folk and ward off their designs. It was also believed that, in order to force a changeling to reveal itself, it must either be surprised into speech or made to laugh. In one tale a mother suspected that her baby had been taken and replaced with a changeling, a view that was proven to be correct one day when a neighbour ran into the house shouting \\"Come here and ye'll se a sight! Yonder's the Fairy Hill a' alowe.\\" To this, the elf got up, saying \\"Waes me! What'll come o' me wife and bairns?\\" and made his way out of the chimney. At Byerholm near Newcastleton in Liddesdale sometime during the early 19th century, a dwarf called Robert Elliot or Little Hobbie o' The Castleton as he was known, was reputed to be a changeling. When taunted by other boys he would not hesitate to draw his gully (a large knife) and dispatch them, however being that he was woefully short in the legs they usually out-ran him and escaped. He was courageous however and when he heard that his neighbour, the six-foot three- inch () William Scott of Kirndean, a sturdy and strong borderer, had slandered his name, he invited the man to his house, took him up the stairs and challenged him to a duel. Scott beat a hasty retreat.The Borderer's Table Book: Or, Gatherings of the Local History and Romance of the English and Scottish Border by Moses Aaron Richardson, Printed for the author, 1846. Page.133-134. Child ballad 40, The Queen of Elfland's Nourice, depicts the abduction of a new mother, drawing on the folklore of the changelings. Although it is fragmentary, it contains the mother's grief and the Queen of Elfland's promise to return her to her own child if she will nurse the queen's child until it can walk.Francis James Child, The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, v 1, p 358-9, Dover Publications, New York 1965 = Poland = The Mamuna or Boginki is a Slavic spirit that exchanges babies (making them into odmie≈Ñce) in the cradle. The changelings left by the Mamuna were said to have a noticeably different appearance; an abnormally large abdomen, unusually small or large head, a hump, thin arms and legs, a hairy body, and long claws. Mamuna changelings would also get their first set of teeth prematurely compared to a human baby. In order to protect a child from being kidnapped by the Mamuna, the mother would tie a red ribbon around the baby's wrist, put a red hat on its head, and keep it out of the moonlight. Other preventative methods included not washing diapers after sunset and never turning their head away from the baby as it slept. Still, even if a child was taken by the Mamuna, there was a way to have her return the baby. The mother would take the changeling child to a midden, whip it with a birch stick, and pour water from an eggshell over it, all while shouting \\"Take yours; give mine back.\\" Typically, the Mamuna would feel sorry for its own child and would return the human baby to its mother. =Scandinavia= In Nordic traditional belief, it was generally believed that it was trolls or beings from the underground that changed children. Since most beings from Scandinavian folklore are said to be afraid of iron, Scandinavian parents often placed an iron item such as a pair of scissors or a knife on top of an un-baptised infant's cradle. It was believed that if a human child was taken in spite of such measures, the parents could force the return of the child by treating the changeling cruelly, using methods such as whipping or even inserting it in a heated oven. In at least one case, a woman was taken to court for having killed her child in an oven.Klintberg, Bengt af; Svenska Folks√§gner (1939) In Sweden, it is believed that a fire must be kept lit in the room housing a child before it is christened, as well as that the water used to bathe the child must not be thrown out, as both of these acts prevent the child from being taken by trolls. John Bauer of two trolls with a human child they have raised In one Swedish tale, the human mother is advised to brutalize the changeling (bortbyting) so that the trolls will return her son, but she refuses, unable to mistreat an innocent child despite knowing its nature. When her husband demands she abandon the changeling, she refuses, and he leaves her ‚Äì whereupon he meets their son in the forest, wandering free. The son explains that since his mother had never been cruel to the changeling, so the troll mother had never been cruel to him, and when she sacrificed what was dearest to her, her husband, they had realized they had no power over her and released him.The tale is notably retold by Swedish author Selma Lagerl√∂f as Bortbytingen in her 1915 book Troll och m√§nniskor The tale is notably retold by Swedish children's story author Helena Nyblom as Bortbytingarna in the 1913 book Bland tomtar och troll. (which is depicted by the image), a princess is kidnapped by trolls and replaced with their own offspring against the wishes of the troll mother. The changelings grow up with their new parents, but both find it hard to adapt: the human girl is disgusted by her future bridegroom, a troll prince, whereas the troll girl is bored by her life and by her dull human future groom. Upset with the conditions of their lives, they both go astray in the forest, passing each other without noticing it. The princess comes to the castle whereupon the queen immediately recognizes her, and the troll girl finds a troll woman who is cursing loudly as she works. The troll girl bursts out that the troll woman is much more fun than any other person she has ever seen, and her mother happily sees that her true daughter has returned. Both the human girl and the troll girl marry happily the very same day. =Spain= In Asturias (Northern Spain), there is a legend about the Xana, a sort of nymph who used to live near rivers, fountains and lakes, sometimes helping travellers on their journeys. The Xanas were conceived as little female fairies with supernatural beauty. They could deliver babies, \\"xaninos,\\" that were sometimes swapped with human babies‚Äì some legends claim this was in order for them to be baptized, while others claim that it is because the Xana cannot produce milk. The legend says that in order to distinguish a \\"xanino\\" from a human baby, some pots and egg shells should be put close to the fireplace; a xanino would say: \\"I was born one hundred years ago, and since then I have not seen so many egg shells near the fire!\\". =Wales= In Wales the changeling child (plentyn cael (sing.), plant cael (pl.)) initially resembles the human it substitutes, but gradually grows uglier in appearance and behaviour: ill- featured, malformed, ill-tempered, given to screaming and biting. It may be of less than usual intelligence, but again is identified by its more than childlike wisdom and cunning. The common means employed to identify a changeling is to cook a family meal in an eggshell. The child will exclaim, \\"I have seen the acorn before the oak, but I never saw the likes of this,\\" and vanish, only to be replaced by the original human child. Alternatively, or following this identification, it is supposedly necessary to mistreat the child by placing it in a hot oven, by holding it in a shovel over a hot fire, or by bathing it in a solution of foxglove.Wirt Sikes. British Goblins: The Realm of Faerie. Felinfach: Llanerch, 1991. In the historical record Children identified as changelings by the superstitious were often abused or murdered. Two 19th-century cases reflect the belief in changelings. In 1826, Anne Roche bathed Michael Leahy, a four-year-old boy unable to speak or stand, three times in the Flesk; he drowned the third time. She swore that she was merely attempting to drive the fairy out of him, and the jury acquitted her of murder.Silver (1999) p. 62 In 1895, Bridget Cleary was killed by several people, including her husband and cousins, after a short bout of illness (probably pneumonia). Local storyteller Jack Dunne accused Bridget of being a fairy changeling. It is debatable whether her husband Michael actually believed her to be a fairy; many believe that he concocted a \\"fairy defense\\" after murdering his wife in a fit of rage. The killers were convicted of manslaughter rather than murder, as even after the death they claimed to be convinced they had killed a changeling, not Bridget Cleary herself.Silver (1999) p. 64-65 Outside of Europe =Africa= The Igbo people of eastern Nigeria traditionally believed that a woman who lost numerous children, whether stillborn or early in infancy, was being tormented by an ogbanje, a malicious spirit that reincarnated itself over and over again. One of the most commonly prescribed methods for ridding oneself of an ogbanje was to find and destroy its iyi-uwa, a buried object tying it to the mortal world. Many scholars now believe that ogbanje stories arose as an attempt to explain the loss of children with sickle-cell anemia. Even today, infant death is common among children born with severe sickle-cell anemia, especially in areas of Africa lacking adequate medical resources. The similarity between the European changeling and the Igbo ogbanje is striking enough that Igbos themselves often translate the word into English as \\"changeling.\\" The abiku was a rough analogue of the ogbanje among the related Yoruba peoples to the west of Igboland. In the modern world The word oaf, meaning a clumsy or stupid person, is derived from the historic English word for a changeling, auf. This, in turn, is believed to have originated from the Middle English alven and elven, and ultimately from the Old Norse word for elf, alfr. =Neurological differences= The reality behind many changeling legends was often the birth of deformed or developmentally disabled children. Among the diseases or disabilities with symptoms that match the description of changelings in various legends are spina bifida, cystic fibrosis, PKU, progeria, Down syndrome, homocystinuria, Williams syndrome, Hurler syndrome, Hunter syndrome, autism spectrum disorder, Prader-Willi Syndrome, and cerebral palsy. The greater incidence of birth defects in boys correlates to the belief that male infants were more likely to be taken.Silver (1999) p. 75 Psychologist Stuart Vyse writes that modern parents have higher expectations of childbirth and when \\"children don't meet these expectations, parents sometimes find a different demon to blame.\\" A condition known as regressive autism, where children appear to develop normally in their early years and then start to show symptoms of autism, can also be compared to marks of a changeling child. As noted, it has been hypothesized that the changeling legend may have developed, or at least been used, to explain the peculiarities of children who did not develop normally, probably including all sorts of developmental delays and abnormalities. In particular, it has been suggested that autistic children would be likely to be labeled as changelings or elf-children due to their strange, sometimes inexplicable behavior. For example, this association might explain why fairies are often described as having an obsessive impulse to count things like handfuls of spilled seeds. This has found a place in autistic culture. Some autistic adults have come to identify with changelings (or other replacements, such as aliens) for this reason, as well as their own feelings of being in a world where they do not belong and of practically not being the same species as the other people around them. (Compare the pseudoscientific New Age concept of indigo children.) =In nature= Several species of birds, fish, and arthropods regularly practice brood parasitism, or non-reciprocal offspring-swapping. Rather than raising their young on their own, they will lay their egg in another's nest, leaving the burden of raising their young on the unsuspecting parents, which are of another species altogether. More often than not, the invading species hatches sooner than its \\"step-siblings\\" and grows faster, eventually hogging most nourishment brought in and may actually \\"evict\\" the young of the host species by pushing them out of their own nest.

Examples are the ancient, the feudal, and the capitalist social order. In the second sense, social order is contrasted to social chaos or disorder and refers to a stable state of society in which the existing social structure is accepted and maintained by its members. The problem of order or Hobbesian problem, which is central to much of sociology, political science and political philosophy, is the question of how and why it is that social orders exist at all. Sociology Thomas Hobbes is recognized as the first to clearly formulate the problem, to answer which he conceived the notion of a social contract. Social theorists (such as Karl Marx, √âmile Durkheim, Talcott Parsons, and J√ºrgen Habermas) have proposed different explanations for what a social order consists of, and what its real basis is. For Marx, it is the relations of production or economic structure which is the basis of social order. For Durkheim, it is a set of shared social norms. For Parsons, it is a set of social institutions regulating the pattern of action-orientation, which again are based on a frame of cultural values. For Habermas, it is all of these, as well as communicative action. Principle of extensiveness Another key factor concerning social order is the principle of extensiveness. This states the more norms and the more important the norms are to a society, the better these norms tie and hold together the group as a whole. A good example of this is smaller religions based in the U.S., such as the Amish. Many Amish live together in communities and because they share the same religion and values, it is easier for them to succeed in upholding their religion and views because their way of life is the norm for their community. Groups and networks In every society, people belong to groups, such as businesses, families, churches, athletic groups, or neighborhoods. The structure inside of these groups mirrors that of the whole society. There are networks and ties between groups, as well as inside of each of the groups, which create social order. Some people belong to more than one group, and this can sometimes cause conflict. The individual may encounter a situation in which he or she has to choose one group over another. Many who have studied these groups believe that it is necessary to have ties between groups to strengthen the society as a whole, and to promote pride within each group. Others believe that it is best to have stronger ties to a group, enabling social norms and values to be reinforced. Status groups \\"Status groups\\" can be based on a person's characteristics such as race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, caste, region, occupation, physical attractiveness, gender, education, age, etc. They are defined as \\"a subculture having a rather specific rank (or status) within the stratification system. That is, societies tend to include a hierarchy of status groups, some enjoying high ranking and some low.\\"Sociology: Tenth Edition by Rodney Stark, 114 One example of this hierarchy is the prestige of a school teacher compared to that of a garbage man. A certain lifestyle usually distinguishes the members of different status groups. For example, around the holidays a Jewish family may celebrate Hanukkah while a Christian family may celebrate Christmas. Other cultural differences such as language and cultural rituals identify members of different status groups. Smaller groups exist inside of one status group. For instance, one can belong to a status group based on one's race and a social class based on financial ranking. This may cause strife for the individual in this situation when he or she feels they must choose to side with either their status group or their social class. For example, a wealthy African American man who feels he has to take a side on an issue on which the opinions of poor African Americans and wealthy white Americans are divided and finds his class and status group opposed. Values and norms Values can be defined as \\"internal criteria for evaluation\\". Values are also split into two categories, there are individual values, which pertains to something that we think has worth and then there are social values. Social values are our desires modified according to ethical principles or according to the group, we associate with: friends, family, or co-workers. Norms tell us what people ought to do in a given situation. Unlike values, norms are enforced externally ‚Äì or outside of oneself. A society as a whole determines norms, and they can be passed down from generation to generation. Power and authority An exception to the idea of values and norms as social order-keepers is deviant behavior. Not everyone in a society abides by a set of personal values or the group's norms all the time. For this reason, it is generally deemed necessary for a society to have authority. The adverse opinion holds that the need for authority stems from social inequality. In a class society, those who hold positions of power and authority are among the upper class. Norms differ for each class because the members of each class were raised differently and hold different sets of values. Tension can form, therefore, between the upper class and lower class when laws and rules are put in place that do not conform to the values of both classes. Spontaneous order The order does not necessarily need to be controlled by the government. Individuals pursuing self-interest can make predictable systems. These systems, being planned by more than one person, may actually be preferable to those planned by a single person. This means that predictability may be possible to achieve without a central government's control. These stable expectations do not necessarily lead to individuals behaving in ways that are considered beneficial to group welfare. Considering this, Thomas Schelling studied neighborhood racial segregation. His findings suggest that interaction can produce predictability, but it does not always increase social order. In his researching, he found that \\"when all individuals pursue their own preferences, the outcome is segregation rather than integration,\\" as stated in \\"Theories of Social Order\\", edited by Michael Hechter and Christine Horne. Social honor Social honor can also be referred to as social status. It is considered the distribution of prestige or \\"the approval, respect, admiration, or deference a person or group is able to command by virtue of his or its imputed qualities or performances\\". The case most often is that people associate social honor with the place a person occupies with material systems of wealth and power. Since most of the society finds wealth and power desirable, they respect or envy people that have more than they do. When social honor is referred to as social status, it deals with the rank of a person within the stratification system. Status can be achieved, which is when a person position is gained on the basis of merit or in other words by achievement and hard work or it can be ascribed, which is when a person position is assigned to individuals or groups without regard for merit but because of certain traits beyond their control, such as race, sex, or parental social standing. An example of ascribed status is Kate Middleton who married a prince. An example of achieved status is Oprah Winfrey, an African American woman from poverty who worked her way to being a billionaire. Attainment Two different theories exist that explain and attempt to account for social order. The first theory is \\"order results from a large number of independent decisions to transfer individual rights and liberties to a coercive state in return for its guarantee of security for persons and their property, as well as its establishment of mechanisms to resolve disputes,\\" as stated in Theories of Social Order by Hechter and Horne. The next theory is that \\"the ultimate source of social order as residing not in external controls but in a concordance of specific values and norms that individuals somehow have managed to internalize.\\" also stated in Theories of Social Order by Hechter and Horne. Both arguments for how social order is attained are very different. One argues that it is achieved through outside influence and control, and the other argues that it can only be attained when the individual willingly follows norms and values that they have grown accustomed to and internalized. Weber's insistence on the importance of domination and symbolic systems in social life was retained by Pierre Bourdieu, who developed the idea of social orders, ultimately transforming it into a theory of fields.

For example, the film editor may work solely in the post-production stage of filming but they might also work throughout the production, editing the film as it is shot and advising the director if and when additional shots or scenes are needed. The boom operator, on the other hand, is mostly on set during filming because they have to pick up the dialogue of the actors as well as ambient noise when the scene is being recorded. This particular type of film crew usually belongs to a guild or union. Some of the unions and/or guilds that represent below- the-line crew include: I.A.T.S.E., The International Cinematographer's Guild (an IATSE organization), The Teamsters, Motion Picture Editors Guild, Animation Guild, and the Motion Picture Sound Editors. It is usually the case for the \\"below-the-line\\" crew to work for hourly wages, as opposed to a set wage, or negotiated contractual wage on the front, or back end of any given project. These set workers are responsible for a number of many other unsung, and demanding tasks that must be completed to achieve the common goal of creating a film, or television program. These positions could be considered \\"less glamorous\\", and the unmentionable part of filmmaking. However, many dedicated and hard working individuals have made a good living with \\"below- the-line\\" job positions, whether it's in independent filmmaking, and or for a major film studio. Dolly Grip with Steadicam at Olympia Medical Center Miracle Mile on the set of the television series Southland Within the many entry-level positions available to gain knowledge of the industry, such as Lighting technicians, grips, wranglers, stunt performers, property masters, ADR, foley, set painters or any stagehand etc., one could gain knowledge and skill of these, and many other key positions within the film industry. Many schools and or nonprofit organizations are set up to train the youth and other interested individuals to better prepare and teach a trade that may not otherwise be available within the traditional school system. These organizations teach about film and video terminology, equipment, and life skills, a must for today's highly competitive entertainment market.

Biblical narrative Gustave Dor√©, The Death of Athaliah. Accounts of the life of Athaliah are to be found in 2 Kings 8:16-11:16 and 2 Chronicles 22:10-23:15 in the Hebrew Bible. She is usually considered to have been the daughter of King Ahab and Queen Jezebel of Israel. Athaliah was married to Jehoram of Judah to seal a treaty between the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, and to secure his position Jehoram killed his six brothers.Jewish Encyclopedia, \\"Jehoram\\" Jehoram became king of Judah in the fifth year of Jehoram of Israel's reign (). Jehoram of Israel was Athaliah's brother (or possibly her nephew). Jehoram of Judah reigned for eight years. His father Jehoshaphat and grandfather Asa were devout kings who worshiped Yahweh and walked in his ways. However, Jehoram chose not to follow their example but rejected Yahweh and married Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab in the line of Omri. Jehoram's rule of Judah was shaky. Edom revolted, and he was forced to acknowledge their independence.Platts, John. A New Universal Biography, Vol.I, p.156, Sherwood, Jones and Co., 1825 A raid by Philistines, Arabs and Ethiopians looted the king's house, and carried off all of his family except for their youngest son, Ahaziah. After Jehoram's death, Ahaziah became king of Judah, and Athaliah was queen mother. Ahaziah reigned for one year from the age of 22 () and was killed during a state visit to Israel along with Jehoram of Israel. Jehu assassinated them both in Yahweh's name and became king of Israel. He had Athaliah's entire extended family in Samaria put to death, ending the Omri dynasty in Israel. Upon hearing the news of Ahaziah's death, Athaliah seized the throne of Judah and ordered the execution of all possible claimants to the throne, including the remnant of her Omri dynasty. However, Jehosheba, Ahaziah's sister, managed to rescue from the purge Jehoash, a grandson of Athaliah and Jehoram of Judah, who was only one year old. Jehoash was raised in secret by Jehosheba's husband, a priest named Jehoiada. As \\"usurper queen\\",Mathys, H. P., 1 and 2 Chronicles in Barton, J. and Muddiman, J. (2001), The Oxford Bible Commentary, p. 297 Athaliah used her power to establish the worship of Baal in Judah. Six years later, Athaliah was surprised when Jehoiada revealed that Jehoash lived and proclaimed him king of Judah. She rushed to stop the rebellion, but was captured and executed. Dating of reigns William F. Albright has dated her reign to 842‚Äì837 BC, while Edwin R. Thiele in the third edition of his magnum opus dates her reign from 842/841 to 836/835 BC.Edwin R. Thiele, The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings (3rd ed.; Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan/Kregel, 1983). However, a starting date of 842/841 for Athaliah is one year before the date of 841/840 that Thiele gave for the death of her son, Ahaziah, a conflict which Thiele never resolved. In literature In 1691, French tragedian Jean Racine wrote a play about this biblical queen, entitled Athalie. The German composer Felix Mendelssohn, among others, wrote incidental music (his op. 74) to Racine's play, first performed in Berlin in 1845. One of the most frequently heard excerpts from the Mendelssohn music is titled \\"War March of the Priests\\" (\\"Kriegsmarsch der Priester\\").Classical Archives' All Music Guide , accessed May 30, 2011. In 1733, the musician and composer Handel composed an oratorio based on her life, called Athalia, calling her a \\"Baalite Queen of Judah Daughter of Jezebel\\". Baal was the fertility god of the Canaanites, whom the ancient Israelites often fell into worshipping in the Tanakh/Old Testament.

Together with The R&A;, the USGA produces and interprets the rules of golf. The USGA also provides a national handicap system for golfers, conducts 14 national championships, including the U.S. Open, U.S. Women's Open and U.S. Senior Open, and tests golf equipment for conformity with regulations. The USGA and the USGA Museum are located in Liberty Corner, New Jersey. History The USGA was originally formed in 1894 to resolve the question of a national amateur championship. Earlier that year, the Newport Country Club and Saint Andrew's Golf Club, Yonkers, New York, both declared the winners of their tournaments the \\"national amateur champion.\\" That autumn, delegates from Newport, St. Andrew's, The Country Club, Chicago Golf Club, and Shinnecock Hills Golf Club met in New York City to form a national governing body, which would administer the championship and also the Rules of Golf for the country. On December 22, 1894, the Amateur Golf Association of the United States was officially formed, and was shortly thereafter renamed the \\"United States Golf Association.\\" Theodore Havemeyer was the first president, and the U.S. Amateur trophy is named in his honor. The first U.S. Amateur was held in 1895 at the Newport Country Club, with Charles B. Macdonald (who was runner-up at both of the previous year's tournaments) winning the championship. The first U.S. Open was held the following day, almost as an afterthought. It was not until 1898 that the two events were held at separate clubs. Today, the USGA administers 14 separate national championships, ten of which are expressly for amateurs. The USGA gradually expanded its membership from the original five clubs. There were 267 club members in 1910, and 1,138 clubs by 1932. Membership fell off during the Great Depression and World War II, but recovered by 1947. By 1980 there were over 5,000 clubs, and today membership exceeds 9,700. On September 17, 1956, Ann Gregory began competing in the U.S. Women's Amateur Championship, thus becoming the first African-American woman to play in a national championship conducted by the USGA. Competitions organized by the USGA 2018 U.S. Open. The USGA organizes or co-organizes the following competitions: =Open championships= An \\"open\\" golf championship is one which both professionals and amateurs may enter. In practice, such events are always won by professionals nowadays. The two leading opens in the U.S. are: * U.S. Open ‚Äì no age or gender restrictions, Handicap Index requirement of 1.4 or less. Established in 1895, it is the second-oldest of the four major championships. * U.S. Women's Open ‚Äì females, no age restrictions, Handicap Index requirement of 2.4 or less. Established in 1946 and administered by the USGA since 1953, it is the oldest of the five women's majors. The last win by an amateur at the U.S. Open was in 1933 and an amateur has won the women's event only once, in 1967. The USGA also conducts the U.S. Senior Open for competitors 50 and over. This is one of the five majors recognized by the world's dominant tour for golfers 50 and over, PGA Tour Champions. The overwhelming majority of the competitors play regularly on this tour. Many of the remaining players compete on the European counterpart of PGA Tour Champions, the European Senior Tour, which recognizes the U.S. Senior Open as one of its three majors. The USGA added a women's counterpart in 2018. * U.S. Senior Open ‚Äì no gender restriction, players age 50 & older, handicap index requirement of 3.4 or less, established in 1980. * U.S. Senior Women's Open ‚Äì women's players age 50 & older, established in 2018. =Individual amateur championships= Professional golf in the U.S. is mainly run by the PGA Tour, the LPGA, and the PGA of America. However, the USGA organizes the 10 national amateur championships. The leading events are open to all age groups, but are usually won by golfers in their early twenties: * U.S. Amateur ‚Äì no age or gender restrictions, handicap index of 2.4 or less, established in 1895. * U.S. Women's Amateur ‚Äì no age restrictions, females with a handicap index of 5.4 or less, established in 1895. There are two championships for players under age 18: * U.S. Junior Amateur ‚Äì no gender restriction, handicap index of 6.4 or less, established in 1948 * U.S. Girls' Junior ‚Äì girls with a handicap index of 18.4 or less, established in 1949 And two for senior golfers: * U.S. Senior Amateur ‚Äì no gender restriction, players age 55 & older, handicap index of 7.4 or less, established in 1955 * U.S. Senior Women's Amateur ‚Äì women age 50 & older with a handicap index of 18.4 or less, established in 1962 Because the U.S. Amateur and U.S. Women's Amateur became increasingly dominated by future tournament professionals, two national championships were added in the 1980s for \\"career amateurs\\" who were 25 years of age & older: * U.S. Mid-Amateur ‚Äì no gender restriction, players age 25 & older, handicap index of 3.4 or less, established in 1981 * U.S. Women's Mid-Amateur ‚Äì women age 25 & older with a handicap index of 9.4 or less, established in 1987 =Team amateur championships= These team events were announced by the USGA in 2013 as the replacements for the discontinued Public Links championships, and played for the first time in 2015. Both are contested by two-member teams in four-ball matches. Partners are not required to be from the same club, political subdivision, or country. * U.S. Amateur Four-Ball ‚Äì no age or gender restrictions; handicap index of 5.4 or less * U.S. Women's Amateur Four-Ball ‚Äì no age restrictions, females with a handicap index of 14.4 or less =State team championships= The USGA men's and women's state team championships were first conducted in 1995 as a part of the USGA's Centennial celebration. The two championships were conducted biennially in odd-numbered years through 2009. Since 2010, the men's championship has been conducted in even-numbered years and the women's championship in odd-numbered years. According to NCAA rules, college golfers are not eligible. *USGA Men's State Team Championship *USGA Women's State Team Championship =International team competitions= The USGA, in cooperation with The R&A;, co-organizes two biennial amateur team competitions between the United States and a joint team representing Great Britain and Ireland (in political terms, Ireland and the United Kingdom). *Walker Cup ‚Äì 10-man male teams, played in odd-numbered years. *Curtis Cup ‚Äì 8-woman teams, played in even-numbered years. The 2018 edition was the first in which The R&A; was directly involved. Previously, the Ladies' Golf Union was the co-organizer, but that body merged with The R&A; in late 2016 (after that year's Curtis Cup had been played). Through its membership of the International Golf Federation the USGA is involved in the administration of the two \\"World Amateur Team Championships\\", which are played biennially in even-numbered years. *Eisenhower Trophy ‚Äì for men *Espirito Santo Trophy ‚Äì for women =Discontinued championships= There had been two events for \\"public- course\\" golfers, but the USGA announced in 2013 that both would be discontinued after their 2014 editions. Members of private golf clubs were excluded from these championships. * U.S. Amateur Public Links ‚Äì popularly known as the \\"Publinx\\"; no gender restriction, handicap index of 4.4 or less, established in 1922 and discontinued in 2014 * U.S. Women's Amateur Public Links ‚Äì popularly known as the \\"Women's Publinx\\"; women with a handicap index of 18.4 or less, established in 1977 and discontinued in 2014 =Multiple event winners= Only eight golfers have won more than one USGA individual event in the same year: * Chick Evans won the U.S. Open and U.S. Amateur in 1916. He went on to win the U.S. Amateur in 1920. * Bobby Jones won the U.S. Open and U.S. Amateur as half of his historic Grand Slam in 1930. Jones had previously won three U.S. Opens (1923, 1926, 1929) and four U.S. Amateurs (1924, 1925, 1927, 1928). * Jay Sigel won the U.S. Amateur and U.S. Mid- Amateur in 1983. He had won the U.S. Amateur in 1982, and would win the Mid-Am in 1985 and 1987. * Pearl Sinn won the Women's Public Links and Women's Amateur in 1988. She successfully defended her Women's Publinx title in 1989. * Ryan Moore won the U.S. Public Links and U.S. Amateur in 2004. He had previously won the Publinx in 2002. * Colt Knost won the U.S. Public Links and U.S. Amateur in 2007. * Jennifer Song won the Women's Public Links and Women's Amateur in 2009. * Seong Eun-jeong won the Girls' Junior and Women's Amateur in 2016.

UNESCO World Heritage Sites entry for ‚ÄúIlhas Selvagens‚Äù (Selvagens Islands)Lu√≠s Carvalho; Nuno Leit√£o (2005) The islands are also known in English as the Salvage Islands or Dry Salvages.Geographical Names, sourced from National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, Bethesda, MD, USAKing, Dean & Hattendorf, John b., A Sea of Words: A Lexicon and Companion to the Complete Seafaring Tales of Patrick O'Brian, Open Road Media, Mar 20, 2012 The archipelago includes two major islands and several islets of varying sizes, in two areas: Selvagem Grande and Selvagem Pequena. The archipelago is administered as part of the Portuguese municipality of Funchal, belongs to the Madeiran civil parish of S√©, and is the southernmost point of Portugal. It was designated a natural reserve in 1971, recognising its role as a very important nesting point for several species of birds. Since then, the decreasing bird populations (namely Cory's shearwater) and nearby waters have been more closely protected by the Portuguese government. Given its status, remoteness and few fresh water sources, the archipelago is today largely uninhabited. The only residents year-round are stationed on Selvagem Grande Island, which includes reserve staff and scientists conducting research on wildlife. Two rangers are also usually resident on Selvagem Pequena between May and October. In May 2016, a National Geographic Society scientific expedition prompted the extension of the marine reserve. Geography Aerial photograph of the Northeastern Group, that includes Selvagem Grande Aerial photograph of the Southwestern Group, includes several islets and Selvagem Pequena The Savage Islands are part of the Macaronesia, the name used to designate the island groups of the North Atlantic Ocean, near Europe and off the coast of Morocco in North Africa. The archipelago lies about from Madeira, and from the Canary Islands. The islands are considered to be a column branch that extends from the Canary Islands at a depth. The total land area of the Savage Islands is . With little fresh water and surrounded by dangerous reefs (which makes limited access difficult), the archipelago consists of two major islands and several islets, in two groups about apart, designated: * Northeast Group - includes the main island of Selvagem Grande () and three small islets: Sinho Islet (Portuguese: Ilh√©u Sinho), Palheiro do Mar, and Palheiro da Terra. * Southwest Group - including the main island of Selvagem Pequena () and Fora Islet (Portuguese: Ilh√©u de Fora, ), also called Great Piton and Little Piton respectively, it is surrounded by a group of very small islets (Alto, Comprido and Redondo) and a group collectively known as the Northern Islets (Portuguese: Ilh√©us do Norte). The geological history of the archipelago can be traced back to the Opening of the North Atlantic Ocean 200 m.y.a in the end of the Triassic period. The islands' physical characteristics are the consequences of mountain-forming and volcanic forces that occurred between 60 and 70 million years ago, typical of many of the islands of Macaronesia. The islands were created during the Oligocene period 29 million years ago, from a large submarine volcano generated by the Canary hotspot and shaped by erosion and marine sedimentation. The larger islands and islet (Grande, Pequena and Fora, respectively) are the remnants of the peaks of these submarine mounts, and although located north of the Canaries, they were never connected to the African continent or any other continental landmass. The archipelago had 2 historic magmatic activity periods, one 29.5 m.y.a and the other one 3.4 m.y.a. and two significant hiatuses between eruptions, the first lasted 12 million years and the second lasted 4.6 million years, a unique occurrence to oceanic volcanic islands. The islands themselves are crossed by many calcareous faults, some marbleised, and made of basaltic rock, ash, and other volcanic materials. On Selvagem Grande there are remnants of extinct cones, such as Atalaia, Tornozelos and Cabe√ßo do Inferno. Other areas are sand covered from extensive aeolian, fluvial and marine erosion; headlands include Atalaia and Leste on Selvagem Grande, and Norte, Oeste, Leste and Garajaus on Selvagem Pequena. Fauna and flora The scientific and natural interest of this tiny group of islands lies in its marine biodiversity, its unique flora and fauna and many avian species that breed annually on its rock cliffs or use them on their stopover on normal migratory patterns. The Selvagens Islands and their surrounding waters present pristine marine and terrestrial communities, with many of its ecosystems in an unaltered state (such as in Selvagem Pequena and Ilh√©u de Fora) and habitat for a wide variety of endemic species and species in an unfavorable state of conservation, they are a unique example of the Macaronesian biogeographical region biota. The archipelago has the highest density (per 100 Km2) of exclusive endemic terrestrial plants of the Macaronesian Region and the lowest number of exotic terrestrial plants taxa (17) of the Madeira Region. =Birds= Cory's shearwater roosting in her nest within the crags on the island of Selvagem Pequena The Selvagens gecko, an endemic species of the Savage Islands The Lobularia canariensis is a native species, indigenous to Macaronesia, an annual plant which grows tall, with oblong-oval leaves and white flowers Selvagens Islands are one of the most important breeding areas for seabirds of Macaronesia and the North Atlantic, offering conditions that are unique in all the world. About 3% of the birds species are resident species, the remaining are migratory species. The abundance of birds on the islands, at one time, made the islands an attractive hunting area for peoples of the region. At the end of the 19th century the German naturalist Ernst Schmitz noted that 20‚Äì22,000 Cory's shearwaters were hunted in September or October in the islands;Ernst Schmitz (1893), \\"Die Puffinenjagd auf den Selvagens-Inseln im jahre 1892\\", Ornithologisches Jahrbuch 1893, Austria, pp.141-147 the hunts continued until 1967. Madeiran expeditions to the islands were responsible for the killing of juvenile birds for food, while their down was used to stuff pillows and comforters. Presently the islands are home or stopover for: Cory's shearwaters (>30,000), white- faced storm-petrel (>80,000), Bulwer's petrel (approximately 4000), North Atlantic little shearwater (1400), Madeiran storm-petrel (1500), yellow-legged gull (50), common tern (>60), roseate tern (<5) and Berthelot's pipit (the only resident bird species); which are subjects of annual scientific expeditions. Many of these species are vulnerable to other local predator bird species, like the yellow-legged gull, which will consume both eggs and chicks (the white-faced storm-petrel and Bulwer's petrel are primarily susceptible). The islands are home to the largest known breeding colony in the world of Cory‚Äôs shearwater and the only site in the Atlantic where Swinhoe's storm petrel can be regularly found. =Sealife= Out of eight total species of sea turtle in the world, five of them occur in Selvagens Islands waters. The most frequent is the loggerhead turtle, followed by Kemp's ridley sea turtle, Hawksbill sea turtle, Green sea turtle and Leatherback sea turtle. A total of 10 cetaceans‚Äô species are recorded for Selvagens Islands surrounding waters, including some with a ‚ÄúVulnerable‚Äù or ‚ÄúThreatened‚Äù global conservation statuses according to IUCN list of threatened species such as fin whales, sperm whales, bottlenose dolphins, common dolphins, short-finned pilot whales, Atlantic spotted dolphins, pigmy sperm whale, sei whale, Bryde‚Äôs whale and a non-confirmed beaked whale species, but many others are expected to be discovered. The sub-tropical geographical position of Selvagens Islands puts it at the limit of the northern distribution range of many tropical oceanic cetaceans species and at the southern limit of species from more temperate latitudes. Despite having a much smaller submerged area with depths less than than other larger Macaronesian archipelagos, the islands have remarkable fish species richness. There are 88 known species of coastal fish, some of them included in endangered and vulnerable status such as the dusky grouper, the Island grouper or the barred hogfish. 27.3% of fish are from the tropical eastern Atlantic Ocean, 10.2% from temperate waters and 6.8% from subtropical waters. =Animals = Ten terrestrial vertebrates are known to live on these islands. Two terrestrial reptiles, the Selvagens gecko and Teira dugesii selvagensis, a subspecies of Madeiran wall lizard, are exclusive to Selvagens Islands. The islands are the only terrestrial mammal-free archipelago in the Macaronesia of the North Atlantic. The Selvagens archipelago is a hotspot of endemic terrestrial arthropods. There are about 219 species and subspecies of terrestrial invertebrates, 92% accounting for arthropods. About 20% of the whole taxa is endemic to the islands. Some endemic species include the sea snails Adeuomphalus marbisensis, Sticteulima lata, Alvania dijkstrai, Alvania freitasi, Alvania harrietae, Atlanta selvagensis, Manzonia boucheti, Osilinus atratus selvagensis and the land snail Theba macandrewiana. Other terrestrial invertebrates endemic to the islands include 3 species of Cossoninae, 2 species of Spider beetles, Cryptorhynchinae and Malachiinae and a species of Bean weevil, Click beetle, Thrips, Harpalinae, Pterostichinae, Lamiinae, Paederinae, Trogossitinae, Julida and a recently discovered species of Aplocnemus. The current number of known endemic species and subspecies is certainly a poor estimate of its real number. =Plantlife= As a consequence of limited introduction, more than 100 species of indigenous plants have been catalogued (most creeping plants and bushes). These plants are similar in many respects to indigenous species on the islands of Madeira and the Canaries, which are better suited to dry arid environments. Germination of these species occurs immediately and briefly after annual showers, and include: Mesembryanthemum crystallinum, Lotus glaucus subsp. salvagensis, Chrysanthemum sarmentoi, Scilla maderensis, Argyranthemum thalassophilum and Lobularia canariensis. Selvagem Pequena and the Fora Islet are the richest floral repositories, since they were never populated by non-indigenous animals or plants. For a period, some indigenous species (primarily Roccella tinctoria and other lichens) were harvested from the islands to support the dye industry of Europe, primarily to England and Flanders in the 15th and 16th centuries, but these adventures were discontinued later. Jacques-Yves Cousteau once found what he believed was \\"the cleanest waters in the world\\" around this minor archipelago; there is an abundance of marine activity, much endemic to the environment, including the barred hogfish, puffer fish (Tetraodontidae), sea spider and many species of sea urchin. At depth of about the waters around the islands/islets are teeming with algae and many migratory species of common fish, routinely migrating from the islands of Cape Verde, Madeira and the Canaries. Although commercial tours of the islands and their biomes are available, all visitors require authorisation from the Madeira Nature Park, the regional environmental authority. History The Portuguese Navy ship NRP Schultz Xavier anchored near the island of Selvagem Pequena Diogo Gomes de Sintra discovered the islands by chance in 1438. Although the Canary Islands had been inhabited by the Guanches, humans are not known to ever have set foot on the Madeira archipelago or the Savage Islands before the Portuguese discoveries and expansion. Consequently, this island group presented itself to Portuguese navigators uninhabited. The first attempted settlement of the islands occurred around 1438 by the Portuguese, although few details remain of this endeavour. The oldest extant description of the colonisation was written around 1463 by the Portuguese mariner Diogo Gomes de Sintra. Gomes wrote that the islands were used to collect \\"ursella\\", as a base for red paint/dyes; \\"ursella\\" referred to the lichens of the scientific families Roccellaceae and Parmeliaceae.Alex Ritsema (2010), p.23-26 In those days, the islands of the Atlantic (the Azores and Madeira) belonged to Henry the Navigator, the Grandmaster of the Order of Christ (the Portuguese successor to the Knights Templar in Portugal). However, the islands were generally omitted from the lists of their possessions. By the 16th century the Savage Islands were held by a family from Madeira, known as Teixeiras Caiados. How the islands found themselves under Caiados control is unknown. In 1560 they were given to Jo√£o Cabral de Noronha. After 1717 they are recorded in wills, inheritances, inventories and other documents. Between 1774 and 1831 taxes were paid to the king. The islands were also recorded in the books of the Conservat√≥ria do Registo Predial of Funchal. From the 15th to the 19th centuries, the islands were used for different economic activities, such as collecting barilla weed and shells and mollusks. The islands, although uninhabited, were also used as a waypoint for fishing, while goats and rabbits were hunted on Selvagem Grande. Until about 1967, in September or October, there were organised hunts for the chicks of the Cory's shearwaters for their oil and meat.Alex Ritsema (2010), p.24-28 The islands have a reputation as pirate treasure islands, and there are many stories of treasure hunting. According to reliable primary documents, at least four times (in 1813, 1851, 1856 and 1948), serious dig attempts were made to recover the supposed treasures but nothing was found.Alex Ritsema (2010), p.29-35 In 1904 the islands were sold to Lu√≠s Rocha Machado. The Permanent Commission of International Maritime Law gave sovereignty of the Savage Islands to Portugal on 15 February 1938. In 1959, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), now known as the World Wide Fund for Nature, became interested in the islands and signed a contract/promise with the owner, Lu√≠s Rocha Machado. In 1971 the Portuguese government intervened and acquired the islands, converting them into a nature reserve. The Savage Islands Reserve was created as part of the Madeira Nature Park; it is one of the oldest nature reserves of Portugal and it also includes the surrounding shelf to a depth of . In 1976, permanent surveillance began, and in 1978 the reserve was elevated to the status of Nature Reserve. In 2002, part of the nature reserve was nominated for UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites: they are currently included in the tentative World Heritage Site list. In the 21st century, the Savage Islands have a permanent team of wardens from Madeira Nature Reserve (on Selvagem Grande there is a permanent research station with two wardens year-round, while Selvagem Pequena is manned usually by two wardens between May and October). These and the Zino family (a family of British origin, known as \\"the guardians of the Savages\\") are the only permanent human inhabitants of the islands. Selvagem Grande gained a weather station controlled by IPMA (the Portuguese Institute of the Sea and the Atmosphere) and is permanently patrolled by the Portuguese Maritime Police to improve safety in navigation and search and rescue, and to prevent pollution and stop illegal fisheries in the reserve.As Selvagens est√£o mais civilizadas - R√°dio Renascen√ßa The self- sustaining status of the islands is disputed by Spain. Their habitability determines whether they should be seen as islands or rocks, which has major consequences for the definition of the southernmost border of the Portuguese EEZ (with Spain), currently under evaluation by the United Nations' Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf.https://www.un.org/Depts/los/clcs_new/clcs_home.htm =Disputed territory= Canaries and archipelago of Madeira Portugal places its southernmost exclusive economic zone claim south of the Savage Islands. Spain formerly objected it on the basis that the Savage Islands do not have a separate continental shelf,Lacleta Mu√±oz, Jos√© Manuel: \\"Las fronteras de Espa√±a en el mar\\". Documentos de trabajo 34-2004, Real Instituto Elcano stating that the border should comprise an equidistant line drawn halfway between Madeira and the Canaries. According to article 121 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea: \\"Rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf.\\" United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, Part VIII, Article 121 The status of the Savage Islands as islands or rocks was thus at the core of the dispute. Spain no longer disputes the Portuguese claim since 2015United Nations Division for Ocean Affairs and The Law of The SeaCommunications received with regard to the submission made by Portugal to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf Despite the islands having numerous visitors, mostly for scientific purposes, and the fact that several settlements were tried throughout the centuries, today the Savage Islands are a special natural reserve whose only year-round inhabitants are the wardens of Madeira's Natural Park. Over the years, apart from the EEZ debate, a number of issues pertaining to the Savage Islands led to disputes between the two countries, namely the construction of a lighthouse, the administration of airspace (done from the closer Canary Islands), the right to perform military air exercises, and, most importantly, illegal fishing and poaching in the archipelago and its vicinity.Carvalho, Luis and Leit√£o, Nuno, A No√ß√£o \\"Estrat√©gica\\" das Ilhas Selvagens (in Portuguese) 19th century * 1880s ‚Äì In an 1881 Maritime Signalisation Commission meeting, Spain requested the building of a lighthouse on the islands. The Portuguese recognised the importance of the lighthouse to the Canary Islands sea route, but deemed it not a priority at the time. In response, the Spanish Foreign Affairs Ministry stated that \\"...the sovereignty of the islands is unclear\\". 20th century * 1910s ‚Äì In 1911, given the lack of action over the requested lighthouse, Spain said it would build it on its own (and annex the archipelago). After a Portuguese protest questioning what it termed \\"Spanish confusion\\" over the issue, Spain said its intention was to reach an agreement \\"in the most amicable terms\\". In 1913, the Portuguese Navy conducted a survey, led by Admiral Schultz Xavier, of the Selvagem Grande Island and recommended Pico da Atalaia as the best location for the lighthouse. * 1930s ‚Äì On February 15, 1938, the Permanent Commission of International Maritime Law declared Portugal as the legitimate sovereign over the islands on February 15. The Spanish government, however, was in the midst of fighting the Spanish Civil War and did not have the opportunity to present its case to the Commission. * 1970s ‚Äì In 1971, the Portuguese government bought the islands from their previous Madeiran owner, and decreed the creation of a natural reserve in the archipelago to protect the area from illegal fishing and poaching, which had severely reduced the bird populations in recent years. In 1972, two Spanish civilian boats, San Pedro de Abona and √Åries, were arrested near the islands. In 1975, fishermen from the Canary Islands disembarked in the islands and waved a Spanish flag. In 1976 another Spanish boat, Ecce Homo Divino, was detained for illegal fishing. * 1996-1997 - On 8 April 1996, Spanish F-18 fighters overflew the islands, followed by a low altitude Puma SA-330J flyby over Selvagem Grande on August 2nd. On the following October 16th, another F-18 flyby over the reserve was filmed by the Portuguese RTP TV channel, prompting the Portuguese Foreign Affairs Ministry to protest. In May 1997, the Ministry of Defense formally requested the Spanish government to stop training exercises near the natural reserve. Spain agreed, but on 1 August 1997 and 24 September 1997, new flybys by Spanish airplanes took place in the vicinity, prompting vehement protests from the Portuguese authorities which led to a formal apology by the Spanish ambassador to Portugal, after which the flights stopped. After this period, the islands were reinforced with a small Portuguese Navy detachment, purportedly to help patrol the islands against illegal fishing and poaching. Later in 1997, Spain formally recognised Portuguese sovereignty over the islands. 21st century * 2005 ‚Äì 23 June, four Spanish fishing boats were detained south of the islands. A few days later, on 8 July, a biologist and one of the nature reserve wardens in the Selvagem Grande Island were threatened with a knife and underwater fishing spear guns by a group of Spanish fishermen. A group of ten Portuguese marines were placed on the island for a month to put an end to poaching of protected species. * 2007 - June, one Spanish search and rescue airplane flew over the islands at low altitude, prompting the Portuguese Ministry of the Environment to contact its Spanish counterpart over the issue. * 2013 - 5 July, Spain sends letter officially complaining to the UN that the Savage islands are just rocks, which would invalidate the Portuguese sovereignty over the islands. * 2013 - 18 July, The serving President of Portugal, An√≠bal Cavaco Silva with the President of the Regional Government of Madeira, Alberto Jo√£o Jardim arrived on the islands on board the Portuguese Navy frigate \\"Vasco da Gama\\" visit and stay on the Islands as part of a tour to meet residents and officials based there. An√≠bal Cavaco Silva became the first President to stay overnight on the islands as former Presidents M√°rio Soares and Jorge Sampaio only visited for a few hours. *2014 - The head of the Spanish Government, Mariano Rajoy, announced that Repsol, an Oil and Gas company will conduct surveys to find oil and gas in the surrounding waters of the nearby Canary islands, would begin \\"very likely\\" between July and September. *2014 - 22 September, Canarian secessionists on behalf of the Canarian Nationalist Alternative party, staged a protest on the smaller island of Selvagem Pequena, to urge the Portuguese government to intercede with the European Parliament so as not to jeopardise the fragile and unique biodiversity of the Macaronesian islands, before the Spanish government completely surrenders to the interests of Repsol. After two days the protestors were transported to Funchal by the Portuguese Navy. *2014 - 17 December, Spain sends Dr Luis Somoza Losada to the UN to give a 448-point report asking for the expansion of Spanish territory at the expense of Portugal. After returning to Spain from New York he states \\"It's the biggest enlargement of Spanish sovereignty since Christopher Columbus\\". Luis Somoza Losada was a coordinator of a team made up of civilians and military that was commissioned to underpin the ambitious maritime expansion of Spain around the Savage Islands. Conducting 6 surveys of the area on 3 ships: the Hesp√©rides, Miguel Oliver and Sarmiento de Gamboa, he discovered that there was gas in the area and possibly oil. *2016 - 21 August, the territory starts being permanently patrolled by two elements of the Pol√≠cia Mar√≠tima, the Portuguese water police, stationed on the Selvagem Grande Island. *2016 - 30 August, Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, joined by the Minister for Internal Administration Constan√ßa Urbano de Sousa, and the President of the Regional Government of Madeira Miguel Albuquerque, visited Selvagem Grande. Rebelo de Sousa remarked that \\"Wherever the President of the Republic goes, he marks our territory\\", and justified the voyage by saying that the Head of State must go to every part of the national territory.

In addition to his scientific endeavors with contributions in optics, crystallography, quantum theory, superconductivity, and the theory of relativity, he had a number of administrative positions which advanced and guided German scientific research and development during four decades. A strong objector to Nazism, he was instrumental in re-establishing and organizing German science after World War II. Biography =Early years= Laue was born in Pfaffendorf, now part of Koblenz, Germany, to Julius Laue and Minna Zerrenner. In 1898, after passing his Abitur in Strassburg, he began his compulsory year of military service, after which in 1899 he started to study mathematics, physics, and chemistry at the University of Strassburg, the University of G√∂ttingen, and the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU). At G√∂ttingen, he was greatly influenced by the physicists Woldemar Voigt and Max Abraham and the mathematician David Hilbert. After only one semester at Munich, he went to the Friedrich-Wilhelms- University of Berlin in 1902. There, he studied under Max Planck, who gave birth to the quantum theory revolution on 14 December 1900, when he delivered his famous paper before the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.Waerden, B.

Bush Planck's Original Papers in Quantum Physics: German and English Edition (Taylor and Francis, 1972) p. 60. At Berlin, Laue attended lectures by Otto Lummer on heat radiation and interference spectroscopy, the influence of which can be seen in Laue's dissertation on interference phenomena in plane-parallel plates, for which he received his doctorate in 1903.Max von Laue ‚Äì Mathematics Genealogy Project.

Laue completed his HabilitationHabilitation title: \\"√úber die Entropie von interferierenden Strahlenb√ºndeln\\" in 1906 under Arnold Sommerfeld at LMU.Walker, p. 73Max von Laue ‚Äì American Philosophical Society Author CatalogMax von Laue ‚Äì Nobel Prize BiographyHentschel, 1996, Appendix F, see entry for Max von Laue.Max von Laue Biography ‚Äì Deutsches Historisches Museum Berlin =Career= In 1906, Laue became a Privatdozent in Berlin and an assistant to Planck. He also met Albert Einstein for the first time; they became friends and Laue went on to contribute to the acceptance and development of Einstein's theory of relativity. Laue continued as assistant to Planck until 1909. In Berlin, he worked on the application of entropy to radiation fields and on the thermodynamic significance of the coherence of light waves. From 1909 to 1912, Laue was a Privatdozent at the Institute for Theoretical Physics, under Arnold Sommerfeld, at LMU. During the 1911 Christmas recess and in January 1912, Paul Peter Ewald was finishing the writing of his doctoral thesis under Sommerfeld. It was on a walk through the Englischer Garten in Munich in January, that Ewald told Laue about his thesis topic. The wavelengths of concern to Ewald were in the visible region of the spectrum and hence much larger than the spacing between the resonators in Ewald's crystal model. Laue seemed distracted and wanted to know what would be the effect if much smaller wavelengths were considered. In June, Sommerfeld reported to the Physikalische Gesellschaft of G√∂ttingen on the successful diffraction of X-rays by Laue, Paul Knipping and Walter Friedrich at LMU, for which Laue would be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, in 1914. While at Munich, he wrote the first volume of his book on relativity during the period 1910 to 1911. In 1912, Laue was called to the University of Zurich as an extraordinarius professor of physics. In 1913, his father was raised to the ranks of hereditary nobility; Laue then became 'Max von Laue'. In 1914 a new professor extraordinarius chair of theoretical physics had been created at the University of Berlin. Laue was offered the position but turned it down, and it was offered to Max Born. But Born was in the army until WW I ended, and before he had occupied the chair, Laue changed his mind and accepted the position. Max von Laue c. 1914 From 1914 to 1919, Laue was at the University of Frankfurt as ordinarius professor of theoretical physics. From 1916, he was engaged in vacuum tube development, at the University of W√ºrzburg, for use in military telephony and wireless communications. In 1919, Laue was called to the University of Berlin as ordinarius professor of theoretical physics, a position he held until 1943, when he was declared emeritus, with his consent and one year before the mandatory retirement age. At the university in 1919, other notables were Walther Nernst, Fritz Haber, and James Franck. Laue, as one of the organizers of the weekly Berlin Physics Colloquium, typically sat in the front row with Nernst and Einstein, who would come over from the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut f√ºr Physik in Berlin-Dahlem, where he was the director. Among Laue's notable students at the university were Le√≥ Szil√°rd, Fritz London, Max Kohler, and Erna Weber. In 1921, he published the second volume of his book on relativity.Max von Laue ‚Äì Mathematics Genealogy Project As a consultant to the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt (PTR), Laue met Walther Meissner who was working there on superconductivity. Meissner had discovered that a weak magnetic field decays rapidly to zero in the interior of a superconductor, which is known as the Meissner effect. Laue showed in 1932 that the threshold of the applied magnetic field which destroys superconductivity varies with the shape of the body. Laue published a total of 12 papers and a book on superconductivity. One of the papers was co-authored with Fritz London and his brother Heinz. Max von Laue Biography ‚Äì University of Frankfurt on MainFritz London Publications ‚Äì Duke University Meissner published a biography on Laue in 1960. The Kaiser-Wilhelm Gesellschaft zur F√∂rderung der Wissenschaften (Today: Max-Planck Gesellschaft zur F√∂rderung der Wissenschaften) was founded in 1911. Its purpose was to promote the sciences by founding and maintaining research institutes. One such institute was the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut f√ºr Physik (KWIP) founded in Berlin-Dahlem in 1914, with Einstein as director. Laue was a trustee of the institute from 1917, and in 1922 he was appointed deputy director, whereupon Laue took over the administrative duties from Einstein. Einstein was traveling abroad when Adolf Hitler became Chancellor in January 1933, and Einstein did not return to Germany. Laue then became acting director of the KWIP, a position he held until 1946 or 1948, except for the period 1935 to 1939, when Peter Debye was director. In 1943, to avoid casualties to the personnel, the KWIP moved to Hechingen. It was at Hechingen that Laue wrote his book on the history of physics Geschichte der Physik, which was eventually translated into seven other languages.Hentschel, 1966, Appendix F, see entries for von Laue and Debye.Hentschel, 1966, Appendix A, see entries for KWG and KWIP. Opposition to Nazism Laue opposed Nazism in general and Deutsche Physik in particular ‚Äì the former persecuted the Jews, in general, and the latter, among other things, put down Einstein's theory of relativity as Jewish physics, which Laue saw as ridiculous: \\"science has no race or religion\\". Laue and his close friend Otto Hahn secretly helped scientific colleagues persecuted by Nazi policies to emigrate from Germany. Laue also openly opposed Nazi policies. An address on 18 September 1933 at the opening of the physics convention in W√ºrzburg, opposition to Johannes Stark, an obituary note on Fritz Haber in 1934, and attendance at a commemoration for Haber are examples which clearly illustrate Laue's courageous, open opposition: *Laue, as chairman of the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft, gave the opening address at the 1933 physics convention. In it, he compared the persecution of Galileo and the oppression of his scientific views on the solar theory of Copernicus to the then conflict and persecution over the theory of relativity by the proponents of Deutsche Physik, against the work of Einstein, labeled \\"Jewish physics.\\" *Johannes Stark, who had received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1919, wished to become the F√ºhrer of German physics and was a proponent of Deutsche Physik. Against the unanimous advice of those consulted, Stark was appointed President of the PTR in May 1933. However, Laue successfully blocked Stark's regular membership in the Prussian Academy of Sciences. *Haber received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1918. In spite of this and his many other contributions to Germany, he was forced to emigrate from Germany as a result of the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, which removed Jews from their jobs. Laue's obituary note praising Haber and comparing his forced emigration to the expulsion of Themistocles from Athens was a direct affront to the policies of National Socialism. *In connection with Haber, Max Planck, Otto Hahn and Laue organized a commemoration event held in Berlin-Dahlem on 29 January 1935, the first anniversary of Haber's death ‚Äì attendance at the event by professors in the civil service had been expressly forbidden by the government. While many scientific and technical personnel were represented at the memorial by their wives, Laue and Wolfgang Heubner were the only two professors to attend.Hentschel, 1996, Document #29, pp. 76‚Äì78: See Footnote #3.Hentschel, 1996, Document #120, pp. 400‚Äì402: A letter from Lise Meitner to Otto Hahn. This was yet another blatant demonstration of Laue's opposition to National Socialism. The date of the first anniversary of Haber's death was also one day before the second anniversary of National Socialism seizing power in Germany, thus further increasing the affront given by holding the event. The speech and the obituary note earned Laue government reprimands. Furthermore, in response to Laue blocking Stark's regular membership in the Prussian Academy of Sciences, Stark, in December 1933, had Laue sacked from his position as advisor to the PTR, which Laue had held since 1925. Chapters 4 and 5, in Welker's Nazi Science: Myth, Truth, and the Atomic Bomb, present a more detailed account of the struggle by Laue and Planck against the Nazi takeover of the Prussian Academy of Sciences.Walker, pp. 65‚Äì122Hentschel, 1966, Appendix F, see entries for Max von Laue, Johannes Stark, and Fritz Haber.Hentschel, 1966, Appendix A, see entry for the DFG. Hidden Nobel prize When Nazi Germany invaded Denmark in World War II, the Hungarian chemist George de Hevesy dissolved the Nobel Prize gold medals of Laue and James Franck in aqua regia to prevent the Nazis from discovering them. At the time, it was illegal to take gold out of the country, and if it had been discovered that Laue had done so he could have faced prosecution in Germany. Hevesy placed the resulting solution on a shelf in his laboratory at the Niels Bohr Institute. After the war, he returned to find the solution undisturbed and precipitated the gold out of the acid. The Nobel Society then re-cast the Nobel Prize gold medals, using the original gold.Adventures in radioisotope research ‚Äì the collected papers of George Hevesy, 1962, Pergamon Press, New York Post-war On 23 April 1945, French troops entered Hechingen, followed the next day by a contingent of Operation Alsos ‚Äì an operation to investigate the German nuclear energy effort, seize equipment, and prevent German scientists from being captured by the Soviets. The scientific advisor to the Operation was the Dutch-American physicist Samuel Goudsmit, who, adorned with a steel helmet, appeared at Laue's home. Laue was taken into custody and taken to Huntingdon, England, and interned at Farm Hall with other scientists thought to be involved in nuclear research and development. While incarcerated, Laue was a reminder to the other detainees that one could survive the Nazi reign without having \\"compromised\\"; this alienated him from others being detained. During his incarceration, Laue wrote a paper on the absorption of X-rays under the interference conditions, and it was later published in Acta Crystallographica. On 2 October 1945, Laue, Otto Hahn, and Werner Heisenberg, were taken to meet with Henry Hallett Dale, president of the Royal Society, and other members of the Society. There, Laue was invited to attend 9 November 1945 Royal Society meeting in memory of the German physicist Wilhelm Conrad R√∂ntgen, who discovered X-rays; permission was, however, not forthcoming from the military authorities detaining von Laue. Laue was returned to Germany early in 1946. He went back to being acting director of the KWIP, which had been moved to G√∂ttingen. It was also in 1946 that the Kaiser-Wilhelm Gesellschaft was renamed the Max-Planck Gesellschaft, and, likewise, the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut f√ºr Physik became the Max-Planck Institut f√ºr Physik. Laue also became an adjunct professor at the University of G√∂ttingen. In addition to his administrative and teaching responsibilities, Laue wrote his book on superconductivity, Theorie der Supraleitung, and revised his books on electron diffraction, Materiewellen und ihre Interferenzen, and the first volume of his two-volume book on relativity.Hentschel, 1996, Appendix A, see entries on KWG and KWIP. In July 1946, Laue went back to England, only four months after having been interned there, to attend an international conference on crystallography. This was a distinct honor, as he was the only German invited to attend. He was extended many courtesies by the British officer who escorted him there and back, and a well-known English crystallographer as his host; Laue was even allowed to wander around London on his own free will. After the war, there was much to be done in re-establishing and organizing German scientific endeavors. Laue participated in some key roles. In 1946, he initiated the founding of the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft in only the British Occupation Zone, as the Allied Control Council would not initially allow organizations across occupation zone boundaries. During the war, the PTR had been dispersed; von Laue, from 1946 to 1948, worked on its re-unification across three zones and its location at new facilities in Braunschweig. Additionally, it took on a new name as the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt, but administration was not taken over by Germany until after the formation of West Germany on 23 May 1949. Circa 1948, the President of the American Physical Society asked Laue to report on the status of physics in Germany; his report was published in 1949 in the American Journal of Physics. In 1950, Laue participated in the creation of the Verband Deutscher Physikalischer Gesellschaften, formerly affiliated under the Nordwestdeutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft. In April 1951, Laue became director of the Max-Planck Institut f√ºr physikalische Chemie und Elektrochemie, a position he held until 1959. In 1953, at the request of Laue, the Institute was renamed the Fritz Haber Institut f√ºr physikalische Chemie und Elektrochemie der Max-Planck Gesellschaft.Hentschel, 1996, Appendix A, see entry on KWIPC. =Personal life= Max von Laue's grave in G√∂ttingen It was in 1913 that Laue's father, Julius Laue, a civil servant in the military administration, was raised into the ranks of hereditary nobility. Thus Max Laue became Max von Laue. Laue married Magdalene Degen, while he was a Privatdozent at LMU. They had two children. Among Laue's chief recreational activities were mountaineering, motoring in his automobile, motor-biking, sailing, and skiing. While not a mountain climber, he did enjoy hiking on the Alpine glaciers with his friends. On 8 April 1960, while he was driving to his laboratory, Laue's car was struck in Berlin by a motorcyclist, who had received his license only two days earlier. The motorcyclist was killed and Laue's car was overturned. He died from his injuries sixteen days later on 24 April. Being a profound believer, he had asked that his epitaph should read that he had died trusting firmly in God's mercy.Max von Laue: Biographical The Nobel Prize in Physics 1914.

Thomas Otway (3 March 1652 ‚Äì 14 April 1685) was an English dramatist of the Restoration period, best known for Venice Preserv'd, or A Plot Discover'd (1682). Life Otway was born at TrottonSamuel Johnson, Lives of the English Poets, 1779-1781, Oxford University Press 1961. Johnson calls it \\"Trottin\\" near Midhurst, the parish of which his father, Humphrey Otway, was at that time curate. Humphrey later became rector of Woolbeding,\\"Woolbedding\\" in Johnson a neighbouring parish, where Thomas Otway was brought up and expected to commit to priesthood. He was educated at Winchester College, and in 1669 entered Christ Church, Oxford, as a commoner, but left the university without a degree in the autumn of 1672. At Oxford he made the acquaintance of Anthony Cary, 5th Viscount Falkland, through whom, he says in the dedication to Caius Marius, he first learned to love books. In London he made acquaintance with Aphra Behn, who in 1672 cast him as the old king in her play, Forc'd Marriage, or The Jealous Bridegroom, at the Dorset Garden Theatre. However, due to severe stage fright, he gave an abysmal performance and never returned to the stage, instead opting to write what was being performed.Chisholm, 1911 The same year as the performance, Humphrey passes away, triggering Otway to officially abandon any thoughts of priesthood and move to London to become a playwright, where he discovers his muse. The muse he had fallen in love with was Elizabeth Barry, who played many of the leading parts in his plays. Six letters to her survive, the last of them referring to a broken appointment in the Mall. She seems to have flirted with Otway, but had no intention of permanently offending Rochester, her lover. In 1678, driven to desperation, Otway obtained a commission through Charles, Earl of Plymouth, a natural son of Charles II, in a regiment serving in the Netherlands. The English troops were disbanded in 1679, but were left to find their way home as best they could. They were paid with depreciated paper, and Otway arrived in London late in the year, ragged and dirty, a circumstance utilized by Elkanah Settle in his Sessions of the Poets. Upon his return, he apparently ceased to struggle against his poverty and misfortunes. At one point in attempts to make money, he tutored the son of famed Restoration actress Nell Gwyn. The generally accepted story regarding the manner of his death was first given in Theophilus Cibber's Lives of the Poets. He is said to have emerged from his retreat at the Bull on Tower Hill to beg for bread. A passer-by, learning who he was, gave him a guinea, with which Otway hastened to a baker's shop. He ate too hastily, and choked on the first mouthful.The same story is given in Johnson's account Whether this account of his death is true or not, it is certain that he died in the utmost poverty, and was buried on 16 April 1685 in the churchyard of St. Clement Danes. Writing career Portrait by William Blake, c. 1800 In 1675 Thomas Betterton produced Otway's first play, Alcibiades at the Dorset Garden Theatre, where all but one of his plays would eventually be produced. It is a tragedy, written in heroic verse, saved from absolute failure only by the actors. Elizabeth Barry took the part of Draxilla, and her lover, John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, recommended Otway to the Duke of York (later King James II). He made a great improvement in Don Carlos, Prince of Spain (licensed 15 June 1676). The material for this rhymed tragedy came from the novel of the same name, written in 1672 by the Abb√© de Saint-Real, the source from which Friedrich Schiller also drew his tragedy of Don Carlos. In it the two characters familiar throughout his plays make their appearance. Don Carlos is the impetuous, unstable youth, who seems to be drawn from Otway himself, while the queen's part is the gentle pathetic character repeated in his more celebrated heroines, Monimia and Belvidera. It got more money, says John Downes (Roscius Anglicanus, 1708) of this play, than any preceding modern tragedy. In 1677 Betterton produced two adaptations from the French by Otway, Titus and Berenice (from Racine's B√©r√©nice), and the Cheats of Scapin (from Moli√®re's Fourberies de Scapin). These were printed together, with a dedication to Rochester. In 1678 he produced an original comedy, Friendship in Fashion, which was very successful. In February 1680, the first of Otway's two tragic masterpieces, The Orphan, or The Unhappy Marriage, was produced at the Dorset Garden, with Mrs. Barry playing the part of Monimia. Written in blank verse, modeled upon Shakespeare, its success was due to Otway's mastery of tragic pathos found in the characters of Castalio and Monimia. The History and Fall of Caius Marius, produced in the same year as The Orphan, and printed in 1692, is a curious grafting of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet on the story of Marius as related in Plutarch's Lives. Caius Marius was incredibly popular during its time, outperforming Romeo and Juliet for at least seventy years following its initial release. In 1680, Otway also published The Poets Complaint of his Muse, or A Satyr against Libells, in which he retaliated against his literary enemies and critics. An indifferent comedy, The Soldier's Fortune (1681), was followed in February 1682 by Venice Preserv'd, or A Plot Discover'd. The story is founded on the Histoire de la conjuration des Espagnols contre la Venise en 1618, also by the Abb√© de Saint- R√©al, but Otway modified the story considerably. The character of Belvidera is his own, and the leading part in the conspiracy, taken by Bedamor, the Spanish ambassador, is given in the play to the historically insignificant Pierre and Jaffeir. The piece has a political stance, with the narrative influenced by the fictitious conspiracy of the Popish Plot, which heightened anti-Catholic sentiments in England in favor of political advancement. His frustrations with such political scandals are evident in a caricature of Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury, a founder of the Whig party in the character of Antonio and in the play's \\"Prologue\\", in the following lines: \\"Poland, Poland! Had it been thy Lot, T'have heard in time of this Venetian Plot; Thou surely chosen hadst one King from thence, And honour'd them as thou hast England since.\\" The allusion is to rumours current at the time that Shaftesbury had planned to make himself King of Poland. Because of this, and the silver pipe John Locke had inserted into him to drain an abscess, he was popularly referred to as \\"Count Tapski\\". Venice Preserv'd also contains an allusion to Rochester's famous deathbed conversion, as reported in Gilbert Burnet's Some Passages of the Life and Death of.. Rochester (1680). The conversion was doubted by many, and Otway is obviously skeptical, for when Pierre is on the scaffold, attended by a priest, he is made to say the following to his executioner (Act V, scene ii): \\"Captain, I'd have hereafter / This fellow write no Lies of my Conversion.\\" The play won instant success. It was translated into almost every modern European language, and even Dryden said of it: \\"Nature is there, which is the greatest beauty.\\" The Orphan and Venice Preserved remained stock pieces on the stage until the 19th century, and the leading actresses of the period played Monimia and Belvidera. His last and most obscure play is The Atheist (1684), although many see it as a way to cash in on his previous comic success with The Soldier's Fortune, some see it not as a weak sequel but as a \\"brilliant experiment.\\"Robert D. Hume, \\"Otway and the Comic Muse\\" Studies in Philology 73 (1976) pp. 87-116 One of the aims of the play is to show what happens after the wedding as sentimental conclusion in plays of the period through the figures of Courtine and Sylvia.

The mineral Braggite is named after him and his son. He was knighted in 1920. Biography The Old Grammar School, Market Harborough, which has a plaque inside noting Bragg's attendance. =Early years= Bragg was born at Westward, England, near Wigton, Cumberland, the son of Robert John Bragg, a merchant marine officer and farmer, and his wife Mary n√©e Wood, a clergyman's daughter. When Bragg was seven years old, his mother died, and he was raised by his uncle, also named William Bragg, at Market Harborough, Leicestershire. He was educated at the Grammar School there, at King William's College on the Isle of Man and, having won an exhibition (scholarship), at Trinity College, Cambridge. He graduated in 1884 as third wrangler, and in 1885 was awarded a first class honours in the mathematical tripos. =University of Adelaide= In 1885, at the age of 23, Bragg was appointed (Sir Thomas) Elder Professor of Mathematics and Experimental Physics in the University of Adelaide,Bragg Centenary, 1886‚Äì1986, University of Adelaide, Pages 3 & 4\\\\. Proof of advertisement in the Oxford University Gazette of 16 October 1885, and the Cambridge University Reporter of 13 October 1885.

Applications with testimonials should reach ... not later than December 1, 1885. Bragg was informed of his appointment by a letter dated 17 December 1885. Australia, and started work there early in 1886. Being a skilled mathematician, at that time he had limited knowledge of physics, most of which was in the form of applied mathematics he had learnt at Trinity. Also at that time, there were only about a hundred students doing full courses at Adelaide, of whom less than a handful belonged to the science school, whose deficient teaching facilities Bragg improved by apprenticing himself to a firm of instrument makers. Bragg was an able and popular lecturer; he encouraged the formation of the student union, and the attendance, free of charge, of science teachers at his lectures. Bragg's interest in physics developed, particularly in the field of electromagnetism. In 1895, he was visited by Ernest Rutherford, en route from New Zealand to Cambridge; this was the commencement of a lifelong friendship. Bragg had a keen interest in the new discovery of X-rays by Wilhelm R√∂ntgen. On 29 May 1896 at Adelaide, Bragg demonstrated before a meeting of local doctors the application of \\"X-rays to reveal structures that were otherwise invisible\\". Samuel Barbour, senior chemist of F. H. Faulding & Co., an Adelaide pharmaceutical manufacturer, supplied the necessary apparatus in the form of a Crookes tube, a glass discharge tube. The tube had been obtained at Leeds, England, where Barbour visited the firm of Reynolds and Branson, a manufacturer of photographic and laboratory equipment. Barbour returned to Adelaide in April 1896. Barbour had conducted his own experiments shortly after return to Australia, but results were limited due to limited battery power. At the University, the tube was attached to an induction coil and a battery borrowed from Sir Charles Todd, Bragg's father-in-law. The induction coil was utilized to produce the electric spark necessary for Bragg and Barbour to \\"generate short bursts of X-rays\\". The audience was favorably impressed. Bragg availed himself as a test subject, in the manner of R√∂ntgen and allowed an X-ray photograph to be taken of his hand. The image of the fingers in his hand revealed \\"an old injury to one of his fingers sustained when using the turnip chopping machine on his father's farm in Cumbria\\".George, Robert.

(later Sir William) Bragg was working on wireless telegraphy, though public lectures and demonstrations focussed on his X-ray research which would later lead to his Nobel Prize. In a hurried visit by Rutherford, he was reported as working on a Hertzian oscillator. There were many common practical threads to the two technologies and he was ably assisted in the laboratory by Arthur Lionel Rogers who manufactured much of the equipment. On 21 September 1897 Bragg gave the first recorded public demonstration of the working of wireless telegraphy in Australia during a lecture meeting at the University of Adelaide as part of the Public Teachers' Union conference. Bragg departed Adelaide in December 1897, and spent all of 1898 on a 12-month leave of absence, touring Great Britain and Europe and during this time visited Marconi and inspected his wireless facilities. He returned to Adelaide in early March 1899, and already on 13 May 1899, Bragg and his father-in-law, Sir Charles Todd, were conducting preliminary tests of wireless telegraphy with a transmitter at the Observatory and a receiver on the South Road (about 200 metres). Experiments continued throughout the southern winter of 1899 and the range was progressively extended to Henley Beach. In September the work was extended to two way transmissions with the addition of a second induction coil loaned by Mr. Oddie of Ballarat. It was desired to extend the experiments cross a sea path and Todd was interested in connecting Cape Spencer and Althorpe Island, but local costs were considered prohibitive while the charges for patented equipment from the Marconi Company were exorbitant. At the same time Bragg's interests were leaning towards X-rays and practical work in wireless in South Australia was largely dormant for the next decade. The turning-point in Bragg's career came in 1904 when he gave the presidential address to section A of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science at Dunedin, New Zealand, on \\"Some Recent Advances in the Theory of the Ionization of Gases\\". This idea was followed up \\"in a brilliant series of researches\\" which, within three years, earned him a fellowship of the Royal Society of London. This paper was also the origin of his first book Studies in Radioactivity (1912). Soon after the delivery of his 1904 address, some radium bromide was made available to Bragg for experimentation. In December 1904 his paper \\"On the Absorption of Œ± Rays and on the Classification of the Œ± Rays from Radium\\" appeared in the Philosophical Magazine, and in the same issue a paper \\"On the Ionization Curves of Radium\\", written in collaboration with his student Richard Kleeman, also appeared. At the end of 1908, Bragg returned to England. During his 23 years in Australia \\"he had seen the number of students at the University of Adelaide almost quadruple, and had a full share in the development of its excellent science school.\\" He had returned to England on the maiden voyage of the SS Waratah, a ship which vanished at sea on its second voyage the next year. He had been alarmed at the ship's tendency to list during his voyage, and had concluded that the ship's metacentre was just below her centre of gravity. In 1911, he testified his belief that the Waratah was unstable at the Inquiry into the ship's disappearance. =University of Leeds= Commemorative plaque on the Parkinson Building, University of Leeds X-ray spectrometer developed by Bragg Bragg occupied the Cavendish chair of physics in the University of Leeds from 1909. He continued his work on X-rays with much success. He invented the X-ray spectrometer and with his son, Lawrence Bragg, then a research student at Cambridge, founded the new science of X-ray crystallography, the analysis of crystal structure using X-ray diffraction. =World War I= Both of his sons were called into the army after war broke out in 1914 . The following year he was appointed Quain Professor of physics at University College London. He had to wait for almost a year to contribute to the war effort: finally, in July 1915, he was appointed to the Board of Invention and Research set up by the Admiralty. In September, his younger son Robert died of wounds at Gallipoli. In November, he shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with elder son William Lawrence. The Navy was struggling to prevent sinkings by unseen, submerged U boats. The scientists recommended that the best tactic was to listen for the submarines. The Navy had a hydrophone research establishment at Aberdour Scotland, staffed with navy men. In November 1915, two young physicists were added to its staff. Bowing to outside pressure for using science, in July 1916, the Admiralty appointed Bragg as scientific director at Aberdour, assisted by three additional young physicists. They developed an improved directional hydrophone, which convinced the Admiralty of their usefulness. Late in 1916, Bragg with his small group moved to Harwich, where the staff was enlarged and they had access to a submarine for tests. In France, where scientists had been mobilized since the beginning of the war, the physicist Paul Langevin made a major stride with echolocation, generating intense sound pulses with quartz sheets oscillated at high frequency, which were then used as microphones to listen for echoes. Quartz was usable when vacuum tubes became available at the end of 1917 to amplify the faint signals. The British made sonar practicable by using mosaics of small quartz bits rather than slices from a large crystal. In January 1918, Bragg moved into the Admiralty as head of scientific research in the anti-submarine division. By war's end British vessels were being equipped with sonar manned by trained listeners. Inspired by William Lawrence's methods for locating enemy guns by the sound of their firing, the output from six microphones miles apart along the coast were recorded on moving photographic film. Sound ranging is much more accurate in the sea than in the turbulent atmosphere. They were able to localize the sites of distant explosions, which were used to obtain the precise positions of British warships and of minefields. =University College London= After the war he returned to University College London, where he continued to work on crystal analysis. =Royal Institution= From 1923, he was Fullerian Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Institution and director of the Davy Faraday Research Laboratory.William Henry Bragg (1862‚Äì1942). The Davy Faraday Research Laboratory This institution was practically rebuilt in 1929‚Äì30 and, under Bragg's directorship many valuable papers were issued from the laboratory. In 1919, 1923, 1925 and 1931 he was invited to deliver the Royal Institution Christmas Lecture on The World of Sound; Concerning the Nature of Things, Old Trades and New Knowledge and The Universe of Life respectively. =The Royal Society and the coming war= Bragg was elected President of the Royal Society in 1935. The physiologist A. V. Hill was Biological Secretary and soon ACG Egerton became Physical Secretary.Van der Kloot 2014, pp. 201-207 During World War I all three had stood by for frustrating months before their skills were employed for the war effort. Now the cause of science was strengthened by the report of a high level Army committee on lessons learned in the last war; their first recommendation was to \\"keep abreast of modern scientific developments\\".Van der Kloot 2014, p. 202. Anticipating another war, the Ministry of Labour was persuaded to accept Hill as a consultant on scientific manpower. The Royal Society compiled a register of qualified men. They proposed a small committee on science to advise the Committee on Imperial Defence, but this was rejected. Finally in 1940, as Bragg's term ended, a Scientific Advisory Committee to the War Cabinet was appointed. Bragg died in 1942. Honours and awards Bragg was joint winner with his son, Lawrence Bragg, of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1915: \\"For their services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-ray\\". Bragg was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1907, vice-president in 1920, and served as President of the Royal Society from 1935 to 1940. He was elected as a member of the Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium on 1 June 1946. He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1917 and Knight Commander (KBE) in the 1920 civilian war honours. He was admitted to the Order of Merit in 1931. * Matteucci Medal (1915) * Rumford Medal (1916) * Copley Medal (1930) * Franklin Medal (1930) * John J. Carty Award of the National Academy of Sciences (1939) Private life In 1889, in Adelaide, Bragg married Gwendoline Todd, a skilled water-colour painter, and daughter of astronomer, meteorologist and electrical engineer Sir Charles Todd. They had three children, a daughter, Gwendolen and two sons, William Lawrence, born in 1890 in North Adelaide, and Robert. Gwendolen married the English architect Alban Caroe, Bragg taught William at the University of Adelaide, and Robert was killed in the Battle of Gallipoli. Bragg's wife, Gwendoline, died in 1929. Bragg played tennis and golf, and as a founding member of the North Adelaide and Adelaide University Lacrosse Clubs, contributed to the introduction of lacrosse to South Australia and was also the secretary of the Adelaide University Chess Association.Bragg Centenary, 1886‚Äì1986, University of Adelaide, page 43. Bragg died in 1942 in England and was survived by his daughter Gwendolen and his son, Lawrence. Legacy The lecture theatre of King William's College (KWC) is named in memory of Bragg; the Sixth-Form invitational literary debating society at KWC, the Bragg Society, is also named in his memory. One of the school \\"Houses\\" at Robert Smyth School, Market Harborough, Leicester, is named \\"Bragg\\" in memory of him being a student there. Since 1992, the Australian Institute of Physics has awarded The Bragg Gold Medal for Excellence in Physics for the best PhD thesis by a student at an Australian university. The two sides of the medal contain the images of Sir William Henry and his son Sir Lawrence Bragg. The Experimental Technique Centre at Brunel University is named the Bragg Building. In 1962, the Bragg Laboratories were constructed at the University of Adelaide to commemorate 100 years since the birth of Sir William H. Bragg. The Australian Bragg Centre for Proton Therapy also in Adelaide, Australia is expected to be completed in late 2013. It is named for both father and son and will offer radiation therapy for cancer patients. In August 2013, Bragg's relative, the broadcaster Melvyn Bragg, presented a BBC Radio 4 programme \\"Bragg on the Braggs\\" on the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics winners.

In different jurisdictions and geographies, a hamlet may be the size of a town, village or parish, or may be considered to be a smaller settlement or subdivision or satellite entity to a larger settlement. The word and concept of a hamlet have roots in the Anglo- Norman settlement of England, where the old French ' came to apply to small human settlements. In British geography, a hamlet is considered smaller than a village and distinctly without a church or other place of worship (e.g. one road or a crossroads, with houses either side).  Etymology  The word comes from Anglo-Norman ', corresponding to Old French ', the diminutive of Old French ' meaning a little village. This, in turn, is a diminutive of Old French ', possibly borrowed from (West Germanic) Franconian languages. Compare with modern French ', Dutch ', Frisian ', German ', Old English ' and Modern English home.T. F. Hoad, English Etymology, Oxford University Press, 1993, .  Afghanistan  In Afghanistan, the counterpart of the hamlet is the qala (Dari: ŸÇŸÑÿπŸá, Pashto: ⁄©ŸÑŸä) meaning \\"fort\\" or \\"hamlet\\". The Afghan qala is a fortified group of houses, generally with its own community building such as a mosque, but without its own marketplace. The qala is the smallest type of settlement in Afghan society, outsized by the village (Dari/Pashto: ÿØŸá), which is larger and includes a commercial area.  Canada  In Canada's three territories, hamlets are officially designated municipalities. As of January 1, 2010: * Northwest Territories had 11 hamlets, each of which had a population of less than 900 people as of the 2016 census; * Nunavut had 24 hamlets, with populations ranging from 129 to 2,842 as of the 2016 census; and * Yukon had two hamlets, both of which had a population of less than 450 people as of the 2016 census. In Canada's provinces, hamlets are usually small unincorporated communities within a larger municipality (similar to civil townships in the United States), such as many communities within the single- tier municipalities of Ontario or within Alberta's specialized and rural municipalities. Canada's two largest hamlets‚ÄîFort McMurray (formerly incorporated as a city) and Sherwood Park‚Äîare located in Alberta. They each have populations, within their main urban area, in excess of 60,000‚Äîwell in excess of the 10,000-person threshold that can choose to incorporate as a city in Alberta. As such, these two hamlets have been further designated by the Province of Alberta as urban service areas. An urban service area is recognized as equivalent to a city for the purposes of provincial and federal program delivery and grant eligibility.  France  During the 18th century, for rich or noble people, it was fashionable to create their own ' (hamlet) in their gardens. They were a group of some houses or farms with rustic appearance, but in fact were very comfortable. The best known is the Hameau de la Reine built by the queen Marie-Antoinette in the park of the . Or the Hameau de Chantilly built by Louis Joseph, Prince of Cond√© in .  Germany  The German word for hamlet is ' (). A Weiler has, compared to a Dorf (village), no infrastructure (i.e. no inn, no school, no store). There are hamlets with churches, these are called \\"Kirchweiler\\" (church hamlet). The houses and farms of a Weiler can be grouped (in the hills and the mountains) or scattered (in the plains). In North West Germany, a group of scattered farms is called Bauerschaft. In a Weiler there are no street names, the houses are just numbered.  India  In different states of India, there are different words for hamlet. In Haryana and Rajasthan it is called \\"dhani\\" ( ') or \\"Thok\\".Sukhvir Singh Gahlot: Rural Life in Rajasthan, page 4.Rajasthani Granthagar, Giani Press Delhi 1986Ashutosh Goyal, 2015, \\"RBS Visitors Guide India - Rajasthan: Rajasthan Travel guide\\"., Data & Expo India Pvt Ltd, .Rann Singh Mann, K.

Poland  In Poland a hamlet is called osada, and is legally a small rural settlement, especially differing by type of buildings or inhabited by population connected with some place or workplace (like mill hamlet, forest hamlet, fishermen hamlet, railway hamlet, State Agricultural Farm hamlet). It can be independent settlement, or a part of other settlement, like village.Ustawa z dnia 29 sierpnia 2003 r. o urzƒôdowych nazwach miejscowo≈õci i obiekt√≥w fizjograficznych (Dz.U. 2003 nr 166 poz. 1612  Romania  In Romania hamlets are called ' (singular: '), and they represent villages that contain several houses at most. They are legally considered villages, and statistically, they are placed in the same category. Like villages, they do not have a separate administration, and thus are not an administrative division, but are part of a parent commune.  Russia  In the Russian language there are several words which mean \\"a hamlet\\", but all of them are approximately equal. The most common word is –¥–µ—Ä–µ–≤–Ω—è (derevnia, the word meant \\"an arable\\" in the past); the words —Å–µ–ª–æ (selo, from the Russian word —Å–µ–ª–∏—Ç—å—Å—è (selit'tsa), meaning \\"to settle\\") and –ø–æ—Å—ë–ª–æ–∫ (posiolok) are quite frequently used, too. The once common Russian word —Ö—É—Ç–æ—Ä (khootor) for the smallest type of rural settlement (arguably closest in nature to the English hamlet) is now mostly obsolete. A hamlet in Russia usually has a church, some little shops, a school and a local culture center (–¥–æ–º –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä—ã / dom kultury, literally meaning \\"a house of culture\\"), in which different culture events and national holidays take place. A hamlet in Russia consists of several tens of wooden (sometimes brick) houses. In the past hamlets were the most common kind of settlement in Russia, but nowadays many hamlets in Russia are settled only during the summer as places for vacation.  Switzerland  In the four national languages hamlets are known as ' (German), ' (French), ' (Italian) and ' (Romansh). A hamlet is always part of a larger municipality or may be shared between two municipalities. The difference between a hamlet and a village is that typically a hamlet lacks a compact core settlement and lacks a central building such as a church or inn. However, some hamlets (') may have grown up as an unplanned settlement around a church. There is no population limit that defines a hamlet and some hamlets have a larger population than some of the smallest municipalities. Generally there are no street names in a hamlet; rather, addresses are given by hamlet name and a number. House numbers might start at one side of the hamlet and continue to the other side or may have no clear organization. A hamlet may form or have formed a ' (legal place of citizenship regardless of where a person was born or currently lives) and may own common property for the '.  Turkey  √áobanpƒ±narƒ±, G√ºzelyurt in Hekimhan, Malatya In Turkey, a hamlet is known as a ' and denotes a small satellite settlement usually consisting of a few houses in the rural outskirts of a village.// Ordinance on Address and Numbering, Turkish Government Gazette ‚Äì  Ukraine  In Ukraine, a very small village such as a hamlet usually is called a '.–•–£–¢–Ü–† (Khutir) // Ukrainian Academic Dictionary ‚Äì  United Kingdom  Haynes Church End in Bedfordshire Harrowden, Bedfordshire in Eastcotts Bodiggo in Cornwall In the United Kingdom, the word hamlet (having the French origin given at the top of this article), means a house or village without a church, although hamlets are recognised as part of land use planning policies and administration. In modern usage it generally refers to a secondary settlement in a civil parish, after the main settlement (if any); such an example is the hamlet of Chipping being the secondary settlement within the civil parish of Buckland. Hamlets may have been formed around a single source of economic activity such as a farm, mill, mine or harbour that employed its working population. Some hamlets, particularly those that have a medieval church, may be the result of the depopulation of a village; an example of such a hamlet is Graby or Shapwick. Because of the hilly topography of the parish, the village of Clent, situated on the Clent Hills consists of five distinct hamlets. In Wales The term hamlet was used in Wales to denote a geographical subdivision of a parish (which might or might not contain a settlement). Elsewhere, mostly in England, these subdivisions were called \\"townships\\" or \\"tithings\\".Kain R J P, Oliver R D, Historic Parishes of England & Wales, HDS, 2001, , p 12 The Welsh word for 'hamlet' is https://glosbe.com/cy/en/pentrefan (also ), with the loose meaning of 'small village'. In Scotland In the Scottish Highlands the term ', of Gaelic derivation, may be preferred to the term hamlet. Also found in Scotland more generally is ' used in the specific case of a farm settlement, including outbuildings and agricultural workers' homes. In Northern Ireland In Northern Ireland the common Irish place name element ' is sometimes considered equivalent to the term hamlet in English, although ' would actually have referred to what is known in English today as a townland: that is to say, a geographical locality rather than a small village.  United States  = Mississippi = In Mississippi, a 2009 state law (¬ß 17-27-5) set aside the term \\"municipal historical hamlet\\" to designate any former city, town or village with a current population of less than six hundred (600) inhabitants that lost its charter before 1945. The first such designation was applied to Bogue Chitto, Lincoln County. = New York = In New York, hamlets are unincorporated settlements within towns. Hamlets are usually not legal entities and have no local government or official boundaries. Their approximate locations will often be noted on road signs, however. A hamlet usually depends upon the town that contains it for municipal services and government; the town can define a \\"special use district\\" (a type of local entity designed to provide a specific service, such as water, sewer, or lighting) to provide only that hamlet with services. A hamlet could be described as the rural or suburban equivalent of a neighborhood in a city or village. The area of a hamlet may not be exactly defined; it may be designated by the Census Bureau, or it may rely on some other form of border (such as a ZIP Code, school district or fire district for more urbanized areas; rural hamlets are typically only demarcated by speed zones on the roads serving them). Others, such as Forestville, New York, will be the remnants of former villages, with borders coextant with the previously defined borders of the defunct or dissolved village. Some hamlets proximate to urban areas are sometimes continuous with their cities and appear to be neighborhoods, but they still are under the jurisdiction of the town. Some localities designated as hamlets, such as Levittown in the Town of Hempstead, with a population of over 50,000, are more populous than some incorporated cities in the state. = Oregon = In Oregon, specifically in Clackamas County, a hamlet is a form of local government for small communities, which allows the citizens therein to organize and co-ordinate community activities. Hamlets do not provide services such as utilities or fire protection, and do not have the authority to levy taxes or fees. There are four hamlets in Oregon: Beavercreek, Mulino, Molalla Prairie, and Stafford.  Vietnam  In Vietnam, a hamlet (', ') is the smallest unofficial administrative unit.

In 1899 Barkla was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, with an 1851 Research Fellowship from the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851,1851 Royal Commission Archives to work in the Cavendish Laboratory under the physicist J. J. Thomson (discoverer of the electron). During his first two years at Cambridge, Barkla would, under the directions of Thomson, study the velocity of electromagnetic waves along wires of different widths and materials. After a year and a half at Trinity College, Cambridge, his love of music led him to transfer to King's College, Cambridge, in order to sing in their chapel choir. Barkla's voice was of remarkable beauty and his solo performances would always be fully attended. He completed his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1903, and then his Master of Arts degree in 1907. He married Mary Esther Cowell in the same year, with whom he would have two sons and one daughter. In 1913, after having worked at the Universities of Cambridge, Liverpool, and King's College London, Barkla was appointed as a Professor of Natural Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh in 1913, a position that he held until his death. Barkla made significant progress in developing and refining the laws of X-ray scattering, X-ray spectroscopy, the principles governing the transmission of X-rays through matter, and especially the principles of the excitation of secondary X-rays. For his discovery of the characteristic X-rays of elements, Barkla was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1917. He was also awarded the Hughes Medal of the British Royal Society that same year. Barkla proposed the J-phenomenon as a hypothetical form of X-ray behaviour similar to X-ray fluorescence but other scientists were not persuaded that this was a different mechanism from other known effects such as Compton scattering and so the theory was not successful. From 1922 to 1938 he lived at Hermitage of Braid in south-wesr Edinburgh.Plaque to Barkla, Hermitage of Braid He died in Edinburgh on 23 October 1944.

She graduated at the top of her class at age 16. In 1952 Taylor enrolled in Huston‚ÄìTillotson College, an all-black college in Austin. Four years later she graduated cum laude with a bachelor of science degree in commercial education. Taylor then attempted to enroll in the University of Texas‚Äôs graduate program but was denied admission on the grounds that she had insufficient undergraduate courses. Because of the state‚Äôs segregationist policy barring the enrollment of blacks in undergraduate programs, she was not able to complete the admission requirements.

Biography  He was born to Vinzenz Hess and Serafine Edle von Grossbauer- Waldst√§tt, in Waldstein Castle, near Peggau in Styria, Austria on 24 June 1883. His father was a royal forester in Prince Louis of Oettingen- Wallerstein's service. He attended secondary school at Graz Gymnasium from 1893 to 1901. From 1901 to 1905 Hess was an undergraduate student at the University of Graz, and continued postgraduate studies in physics until he received his PhD there in 1910. He worked as Assistant under Stefan Meyer at the Institute for Radium Research, Viennese Academy of Sciences, from 1910 to 1920. In 1920 he married Marie Bertha Warner Breisky. Hess took a leave of absence in 1921 and travelled to the United States, working at the United States Radium Corporation, in New Jersey, and as Consulting Physicist for the US Bureau of Mines, in Washington, D.C. In 1923, he returned to the University of Graz, and was appointed the Ordinary Professor of Experimental Physics in 1925. The University of Innsbruck appointed him Professor, and Director Institute of Radiology, in 1931. Hess relocated to the United States with his Jewish wife in 1938, in order to escape Nazi persecution. The same year Fordham University appointed him Professor of Physics, and he later became a naturalized United States citizen in 1944. His wife died of cancer in 1955. The same year he married Elizabeth M. Hoenke, the woman who nursed Berta at the end of her life. He was a practicing Roman Catholic, and in 1946 he wrote on the topic of the relationship between science and religion in his article \\"My Faith\\", in which he explained why he believed in God.Victor Franz Hess. \\"My Faith\\".

Cosmic rays  Hess (center) at work Between 1911 and 1913, Hess undertook the work that won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1936. For many years, scientists had been puzzled by the levels of ionizing radiation measured in the atmosphere. The assumption at the time was that the radiation would decrease as the distance from the earth, the then assumed source of the radiation, increased. The electroscopes previously used gave an approximate measurement of the radiation, but indicated that at greater altitude in the atmosphere the level of radiation might actually be higher than that on the ground. Hess approached this mystery first by greatly increasing the precision of the measuring equipment, and then by personally taking the equipment aloft in a balloon. He systematically measured the radiation at altitudes up to 5.3 km during 1911-12. The daring flights were made both at day and during the night, at significant risk to himself. The result of Hess's meticulous work was published in the Proceedings of the Viennese Academy of Sciences, and showed the level of radiation decreased up to an altitude of about 1 km, but above that the level increased considerably, with the radiation detected at 5 km being about twice that at sea level. His conclusion was that there was radiation penetrating the atmosphere from outer space, and his discovery was confirmed by Robert Andrews Millikan in 1925, who gave the radiation the name \\"cosmic rays\\". Hess's discovery opened the door to many new discoveries in particle and nuclear physics. In particular, both the positron and the muon were first discovered in cosmic rays by Carl David Anderson. Hess and Anderson shared the 1936 Nobel Prize in Physics.

He is best known for his discovery of the positron in 1932, an achievement for which he received the 1936 Nobel Prize in Physics, and of the muon in 1936. Biography Anderson was born in New York City, the son of Swedish immigrants. He studied physics and engineering at Caltech (B.S., 1927; Ph.D., 1930). Under the supervision of Robert A. Millikan, he began investigations into cosmic rays during the course of which he encountered unexpected particle tracks in his (modern versions now commonly referred to as an Anderson) cloud chamber photographs that he correctly interpreted as having been created by a particle with the same mass as the electron, but with opposite electrical charge. This discovery, announced in 1932 and later confirmed by others, validated Paul Dirac's theoretical prediction of the existence of the positron. Anderson first detected the particles in cosmic rays. He then produced more conclusive proof by shooting gamma rays produced by the natural radioactive nuclide ThC (208Tl)ThC\\" is a historical designation of 208Tl, see Decay chains into other materials, resulting in the creation of positron-electron pairs. For this work, Anderson shared the 1936 Nobel Prize in Physics with Victor Hess.The Nobel Prize in Physics 1936. nobelprize.org Fifty years later, Anderson acknowledged that his discovery was inspired by the work of his Caltech classmate Chung-Yao Chao, whose research formed the foundation from which much of Anderson's work developed but was not credited at the time. Also in 1936, Anderson and his first graduate student, Seth Neddermeyer, discovered a muon (or 'mu-meson', as it was known for many years), a subatomic particle 207 times more massive than the electron, but with the same negative electric charge and spin 1/2 as the electron, again in cosmic rays. Anderson and Neddermeyer at first believed that they had seen a pion, a particle which Hideki Yukawa had postulated in his theory of the strong interaction. When it became clear that what Anderson had seen was not the pion, the physicist I. I. Rabi, puzzled as to how the unexpected discovery could fit into any logical scheme of particle physics, quizzically asked \\"Who ordered that?\\" (sometimes the story goes that he was dining with colleagues at a Chinese restaurant at the time). The muon was the first of a long list of subatomic particles whose discovery initially baffled theoreticians who could not make the confusing \\"zoo\\" fit into some tidy conceptual scheme. Willis Lamb, in his 1955 Nobel Prize Lecture, joked that he had heard it said that \\"the finder of a new elementary particle used to be rewarded by a Nobel Prize, but such a discovery now ought to be punished by a 10,000 dollar fine.\\"Willis E. Lamb, Jr. (December 12, 1955) Fine structure of the hydrogen atom. Nobel Lecture Anderson spent all of his academic and research career at Caltech. During World War II, he conducted research in rocketry there. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1950. He received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1975. He died on January 11, 1991, and his remains were interred in the Forest Lawn, Hollywood Hills Cemetery in Los Angeles, California. His wife Lorraine died in 1984.

A character class aggregates several abilities and aptitudes, and may also detail aspects of background and social standing, or impose behavior restrictions. Classes may be considered to represent archetypes, or specific careers. RPG systems that employ character classes often subdivide them into levels of accomplishment, to be attained by players during the course of the game. It is common for a character to remain in the same class for its lifetime; although some games allow characters to change class, or attain multiple classes. Some systems eschew the use of classes and levels entirely; others hybridise them with skill-based systems or emulate them with character templates.  History  Dungeons & Dragons (D&D;), the first formalized roleplaying game, introduced the use of classes, and many subsequent games adopted variations of the same idea. These games are sometimes referred to as 'class-based' systems. As well as tabletop games, character classes are found in many role-playing video games and live action role-playing games. Many of the most popular role- playing games, such as D20 system and White Wolf games still use character classes in one way or another. Most games offer additional ways to systematically differentiate characters, such as race, skills, or affiliations. Class archetypes Class selection screen in Falcon's Eye. In fantasy games, it is usual to find one (or more) class that excels in combat, several classes (called spell-casters) that are able to perform magic (often different kinds of magic), and classes that deal with stealth. For example, the original Dungeons & Dragons provided a set of three classes: *Fighting Man (renamed \\"Fighter\\" in later editions), focused on combat abilities, but almost entirely lacking in magical abilities *Magic User (renamed \\"Mage\\" and then \\"Wizard\\" in later editions), featuring powerful magical abilities, but physically weak *Cleric, specializing in healing and supportive magical abilities With later editions was added the Thief (later Rogue) and Ranger classes: *Thief (renamed \\"Rogue\\" in later editions), nimble combatant focused on stealth and social skills, also capable of high-damage special attacks balanced by sub-par resistance to injury *Ranger a ranged weapons specialist Non-fantasy role-playing games often fill the place of the magic user with scientist classes, the cleric with a medic or similarly supportive role, and the rogue and/or ranger with an explorer. Some also use a psychic powers as a stand in for magic. There are also character classes that combine features of the classes listed above and are frequently called hybrid classes. Some examples include the Bard (a cross between the Thief and Mage with an emphasis on interpersonal skills, mental and visual spells, and supportive magical abilities), or the Paladin (a cross between the Fighter and Cleric with slightly decreased combat skills relative to a fighter but various innate abilities that are used to heal or protect allies and repel and/or smite evil opponents).  Class system variations  Some RPGs feature another variation on the classes mechanic. For example, in Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay, players choose a career. The career works like a class with abilities (known in WFRP as skills and talents) added to the character based on the chosen career. However, as the player advances and gains more experience he or she may choose a new career according to a predefined career path or change to a completely different career. WFRP is also notable in that characters are encouraged to roll to determine their starting career which is compensated for by free XP which can be spent on more skills. As an alternative to class-based systems, skill-based systems are designed to give the player a stronger sense of control over how their character develops. In such systems, players can often choose the direction of their characters as they play, usually by assigning points to certain skills. Classless games often provide templates for the player to work from, many of which are based on traditional character classes. Many classless games' settings or rules systems lend themselves to the creation of character following certain archetypal trends. For example, in the role-playing video game Fallout, common character archetypes include the \\"shooter\\", \\"survivalist\\", \\"scientist\\", \\"smooth talker\\" and \\"sneaker\\", unofficial terms representing various possible means of solving or avoiding conflicts and puzzles in the game. GURPS, which inspired Fallout's system, also used a classless system. Outside of role-playing games, some other cooperative video games, such as Battlefield 2 and Star Wars Battlefront II use class-based systems to leverage the emphasis they provide on cooperation.

The newly elected 144 members of the 20th D√°il assembled at Leinster House on 4 March when the new Taoiseach and government were appointed. The general election took place in 42 parliamentary constituencies throughout Ireland for 144 seats in the lower house of parliament, D√°il √âireann. Campaign By the time the general election was called in 1973, Fianna F√°il had been in power for almost sixteen consecutive years. During that time the party had seen three different leaders: √âamon de Valera, Se√°n Lemass, and since 1966, Jack Lynch. As a result of this, much of the electorate believed it was time for a change of government. Lynch had hoped to dissolve the D√°il in December 1972; however, events did not permit this, and the election was eventually called for February 1973. While Fine Gael and the Labour Party had pursued individual opposition policies since 1957, they now realised that the only way to oust Fianna F√°il would be to join forces. Not long after the general election was called, both parties agreed to a pre-election pact to fight the election together on the issues that united them. The National Coalition, as it was known, offered the electorate the first credible alternative government in many years. While Fianna F√°il actually increased its percentage of the vote, it lost seats. The increase in the percentage was remarkable considering the party had been in power for so long, and also because of the \\"Arms Crisis\\". A clever use of transfers between the National Coalition parties in the single transferable vote system enabled a change of government to take place. Coverage of the general election by the national broadcaster, Radio Telef√≠s √âireann, also saw a unique event. Jack Lynch, in an interview with Brian Farrell on the programme, became the first Taoiseach to concede defeat live on Irish television. Although the full result was not yet known, Lynch was certain that the transfers between candidates would result in Fianna F√°il losing the general election. Court case The Fourth Amendment of the Constitution, approved in a referendum in December 1972 and signed into law in January 1973, had reduced the voting age from 21 to 18. However, the electoral register would not be updated until 15 April, five weeks after the election date. A 20-year-old student, represented by Se√°n MacBride, asked the High Court to postpone the election to vindicate his right to vote.

Otto Stern (17 February 1888 ‚Äì 17 August 1969) was a German-American physicist and Nobel laureate in physics. He was the second most nominated person for a Nobel Prize with 82 nominations in the years 1925‚Äì1945 (most times nominated is Arnold Sommerfeld with 84 nominations), ultimately winning in 1943. Biography Plaque on the wall of what are now the physics institutes of Hamburg University, commemorating Stern's tenure Stern was born into a Jewish family in Sohrau (now ≈ªory) in the Province of Silesia, the German Empire's Kingdom of Prussia. His father was Oskar Stern (1850-1919), a mill owner, who had been living in Breslau (now Wroc≈Çaw) since 1892. His mother Eugenia n√©e Rosenthal (1863-1907) was from Rawitsch (now Rawicz) in the Prussian Province of Posen. Otto Stern had a brother, Kurt, who became a noted botanist in Frankfurt, and three sisters. He studied in Freiburg im Breisgau, Munich and Breslau. Stern completed his studies at the University of Breslau in 1912 with a doctoral dissertation in physical chemistry under supervision of Otto Sackur on the kinetic theory of osmotic pressure in concentrated solutions. He then followed Albert Einstein to Charles University in Prague and in 1913 to ETH Zurich. Stern served in World War I doing meteorological work on the Russian front while still continuing his studies and in 1915 received his Habilitation at the University of Frankfurt. In 1921 he became a professor at the University of Rostock which he left in 1923 to become director of the newly founded Institut f√ºr Physikalische Chemie at the University of Hamburg. After resigning from his post at the University of Hamburg in 1933 because of the Nazis' Machtergreifung (seizure of power), he found refuge in the city of Pittsburgh becoming a professor of physics at the Carnegie Institute of Technology. During the 1930s, he was a visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley. As an experimental physicist Stern contributed to the discovery of spin quantization in the Stern‚ÄìGerlach experiment with Walther Gerlach in February 1922 at the Physikalischer Verein in Frankfurt am Main;Walther Gerlach & Otto Stern, \\"Das magnetische Moment des Silberatoms\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Physik, V9, N1, pp. 353‚Äì355 (1922). demonstration of the wave nature of atoms and molecules; measurement of atomic magnetic moments; discovery of the proton's magnetic moment; and development of the molecular beam method which is utilized for the technique of molecular beam epitaxy. He was awarded the 1943 Nobel Prize in Physics, the first to be awarded since 1939. It was awarded to Stern alone, \\"for his contribution to the development of the molecular ray method and his discovery of the magnetic moment of the proton\\" (not for the Stern‚ÄìGerlach experiment). The 1943 prize was actually awarded in 1944. After Stern retired from the Carnegie Institute of Technology, he moved to Berkeley, California. He was a regular visitor to the Physics colloquium at UC Berkeley. He died of a heart attack in Berkeley on 17 August 1969. The Stern-Gerlach-Medaille of the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft awarded for excellence in experimental physics is named after him and Gerlach.

He was a Cambridge Apostle. Career The son of Charles Noel, 1st Earl of Gainsborough and Lady Frances Jocelyn, he was educated at Windlesham House School, Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he obtained his M.A. in 1858. He then spent two years travelling in the East. In 1863, he married Alice de Bro√´, daughter of the director of the Ottoman Bank in Beirut. Their third child, Eric, who died aged five, is commemorated in Roden Noel's best-known book of verse, A Little Child's Monument (1881). The latter part of his life was spent at Brighton, but he died in the train station of Mainz in Germany. His son Conrad Noel became a Christian Socialist, famous as the \\"turbulent priest of Thaxted\\". Roden Noel's versification was unequal and sometimes harsh, but he has a genuine feeling for nature, and the work is permeated by philosophic thought. His other works include a drama in verse, The House of Ravensburg (1877), an epic on David Livingstone's expedition in Africa, a Life of Byron (1890, Great Writers series), an edition of Edmund Spenser's poems, a selection of Thomas Otway's plays (1888) for the Mermaid series, and critical papers on literature and philosophy. His Collected Poems were edited (1902) by his sister, Victoria Buxton, with a notice by John Addington Symonds, which had originally appeared in the Academy (January 19, 1899) as a review of The Modern Faust.

Work K√°lm√°n was an electrical engineer by his undergraduate and graduate education at M.I.T. and Columbia University, and he was noted for his co- invention of the Kalman filter (or Kalman-Bucy Filter), which is a mathematical technique widely used in the digital computers of control systems, navigation systems, avionics, and outer-space vehicles to extract a signal from a long sequence of noisy or incomplete measurements, usually those done by electronic and gyroscopic systems. K√°lm√°n's ideas on filtering were initially met with vast skepticism, so much so that he was forced to do the first publication of his results in mechanical engineering, rather than in electrical engineering or systems engineering. K√°lm√°n had more success in presenting his ideas, however, while visiting Stanley F. Schmidt at the NASA Ames Research Center in 1960. This led to the use of K√°lm√°n filters during the Apollo program, and furthermore, in the NASA Space Shuttle, in Navy submarines, and in unmanned aerospace vehicles and weapons, such as cruise missiles. K√°lm√°n published several seminal papers during the sixties, which rigorously established what is now known as the state-space representation of dynamical systems. He introduced the formal definition of a system, the notions of controllability and observability, eventually leading to the Kalman decomposition. K√°lm√°n also gave groundbreaking contributions to the theory of optimal control and provided, in his joint work with J. E. Bertram, a comprehensive and insightful exposure of stability theory for dynamical systems. He also worked with B. L. Ho on the minimal realization problem, providing the well known Ho-Kalman algorithm. Awards and honors K√°lm√°n was a foreign member of the French, Hungarian and Russian Academies of Sciences, as well as a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He has been awarded many honorary doctorates from other universities.

It is the second-largest native canid on the continent, after the maned wolf. In appearance, it bears many similarities to the widely recognized red fox. It has grey and reddish fur, a white chin, reddish legs and a stripe on its back that may be barely visible. The culpeo's diet consists largely of rodents, rabbits, birds and lizards, and to a lesser extent, plant material and carrion. The culpeo does attack sheep on occasion and is therefore often hunted or poisoned. In some regions, it has become rare, but overall the species is not threatened with extinction. The culpeo was domesticated to form the Fuegian dog, but this animal became extinct some time between 1880 and 1919. Description Culpeo skull The culpeo is a canid intermediate in size between a red fox and a coyote. The average weight of the male is , while the typically smaller females average . Overall, a weight range of has been reported. Total length can range from , including a tail of in length.Burnie D and Wilson DE (Eds.) (2005), Animal: The Definitive Visual Guide to the World's Wildlife. DK Adult, The pelt has a grizzled appearance. The neck and shoulders are often tawny to rufous in color, while the upper back is dark. The bushy tail has a black tip. Range A culpeo in the Antofagasta Region Its distribution extends from Ecuador and Peru to the southern regions of Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego. Some populations live in southern regions of Colombia. It is most common on the western slopes of the Andes, where it inhabits open country and deciduous forests. Populations of the culpeo are also found in some of the westernmost of the Falkland Islands, where they were introduced by humans. Habitat The culpeo lives in a wide variety of habitats of western South America. They are found in broadleaf Nothofagus temperate rainforest, sclerophyllous matorral, deserts and high plateaus, like the Altiplano, up to the tree line (). Diet A culpeo feasting on carrion of vicu√±a at El Tatio, San Pedro de Atacama, the Antofagasta Region The culpeo fox is an opportunistic predator that will take any variety of prey. This fox mainly feeds on rodents and lagomorphs (especially the introduced European rabbit and European hare); however, it occasionally feeds on domestic livestock and young guanacos.Andres J. Novaro, Claudio A. Moraga, Cristobal Bricen, Martin C. Funes, Andrea Marino (2009) First records of culpeo (Lycalopex culpaeus) attacks and cooperative defense by guanacos (Lama guanicoe). Mammalia, Volume 73 Culpeos are considered beneficial because they are significant predators of the rabbits introduced in 1915; such introduced rabbit populations are believed to have allowed culpeos to spread from the Andean foothills across the Patagonian plain.Alderton, David. Foxes, Wolves, and Wild Dogs of the World. London: Blandford, 1998. p175-6. They sometimes take young lambs up to a week old. In limited studies, the larger culpeo appears to dominate potential competitors, including South American gray foxes, Geoffroy's cats, pampas cats, grisons and various raptorial birds. Its range also overlaps that of the much larger puma, but the size difference ensures that the two species have limited competition. They are known to eat the carrion of Vicu√±as. Reproduction The typical mating period is between August and October. After a gestation period of 55‚Äì60 days, the female gives birth usually to between two and five pups.

Over the past three decades, they have been placed variably in the genera Dusicyon (Clutton- Brock, et al., 1976; Wozencraft, 1989), Canis (Langguth, 1975; Van Gelder, 1978), Pseudalopex (Berta, 1987; Wozencraft, 1993; Tedford et al., 1995) and Lycalopex (Zunino, 1995; Wozencraft, 2005). This canid, like other South American foxes, is still sometimes classified as a member of the genus Pseudalopex. As Pseudalopex and Lycalopex have largely come to describe the same genus, either classification is acceptable, although the modern practice is to give Lycalopex prominence.

He also wrote extensively on the scientific method and on other aspects of the philosophy of science. The Bridgman effect and the Bridgman‚ÄìStockbarger technique are named after him. Biography =Early life= Known to family and friends as Peter, Bridgman was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and grew up in nearby Auburndale. Bridgman's parents were both born in New England. His father, Raymond Landon Bridgman, was \\"profoundly religious and idealistic\\" and worked as a newspaper reporter assigned to state politics. His mother, Mary Ann Maria Williams, was described as \\"more conventional, sprightly, and competitive\\". Bridgman attended both elementary and high school in Auburndale, where he excelled at competitions in the classroom, on the playground, and while playing chess. Described as both shy and proud, his home life consisted of family music, card games, and domestic and garden chores. The family was deeply religious; reading the Bible each morning and attending a Congregational Church. However, Bridgman later became an atheist.Ray Monk (2013). Robert Oppenheimer: A Life Inside the Center. Random House LLC. . In many ways they were opposites; Kemble, the theorist, was a devout Christian, while Bridgman, the experimentalist, was a strident atheist. =Education and professional life= Bridgman entered Harvard University in 1900, and studied physics through to his Ph.D. From 1910 until his retirement, he taught at Harvard, becoming a full professor in 1919. In 1905, he began investigating the properties of matter under high pressure. A machinery malfunction led him to modify his pressure apparatus; the result was a new device enabling him to create pressures eventually exceeding 100,000 kgf/cm2 (10 GPa; 100,000 atmospheres). This was a huge improvement over previous machinery, which could achieve pressures of only 3,000 kgf/cm2 (0.3 GPa). This new apparatus led to an abundance of new findings, including a study of the compressibility, electric and thermal conductivity, tensile strength and viscosity of more than 100 different compounds. Bridgman is also known for his studies of electrical conduction in metals and properties of crystals. He developed the Bridgman seal and is the eponym for Bridgman's thermodynamic equations. Bridgman made many improvements to his high-pressure apparatus over the years, and unsuccessfully attempted the synthesis of diamond many times. His philosophy of science book The Logic of Modern Physics (1927) advocated operationalism and coined the term operational definition. In 1938 he participated in the International Committee composed to organise the International Congresses for the Unity of Science. He was also one of the 11 signatories to the Russell‚ÄìEinstein Manifesto. =Home life and death= Bridgman with wife and Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden in Stockholm im 1946 Bridgman married Olive Ware, of Hartford, Connecticut, in 1912. Ware's father, Edmund Asa Ware, was the founder and first president of Atlanta University. The couple had two children and were married for 50 years, living most of that time in Cambridge. The family also had a summer home in Randolph, New Hampshire, where Bridgman was known as a skilled mountain climber. Bridgman was a \\"penetrating analytical thinker\\" with a \\"fertile mechanical imagination\\" and exceptional manual dexterity. He was a skilled plumber and carpenter, known to shun the assistance of professionals in these matters. He was also fond of music and played the piano, and took pride in his flower and vegetable gardens. Bridgman committed suicide by gunshot after suffering from metastatic cancer for some time. His suicide note read in part, \\"It isn't decent for society to make a man do this thing himself. Probably this is the last day I will be able to do it myself.\\"Nuland, Sherwin.

Honors and awards Bridgman received Doctors, honoris causa from Stevens Institute (1934), Harvard (1939), Brooklyn Polytechnic (1941), Princeton (1950), Paris (1950), and Yale (1951). He received the Bingham Medal (1951) from the Society of Rheology, the Rumford Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1919), the Elliott Cresson Medal (1932) from the Franklin Institute, the Gold Medal from Bakhuys Roozeboom Fund (founder Hendrik Willem Bakhuis Roozeboom) (1933) from the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the Comstock Prize (1933) of the National Academy of Sciences.

Usually a sensing device is used to compare the actual state (e.g. temperature) with a target state. Then the control system draws a conclusion what action has to be taken (e.g. start the blower). Direct digital control Central controllers and most terminal unit controllers are programmable, meaning the direct digital control program code may be customized for the intended use. The program features include time schedules, setpoints, controllers, logic, timers, trend logs, and alarms. The unit controllers typically have analog and digital inputs that allow measurement of the variable (temperature, humidity, or pressure) and analog and digital outputs for control of the transport medium (hot/cold water and/or steam). Digital inputs are typically (dry) contacts from a control device, and analog inputs are typically a voltage or current measurement from a variable (temperature, humidity, velocity, or pressure) sensing device. Digital outputs are typically relay contacts used to start and stop equipment, and analog outputs are typically voltage or current signals to control the movement of the medium (air/water/steam) control devices such as valves, dampers, and motors. Groups of DDC controllers, networked or not, form a layer of system themselves. This \\"subsystem\\" is vital to the performance and basic operation of the overall HVAC system. The DDC system is the \\"brain\\" of the HVAC system. It dictates the position of every damper and valve in a system. It determines which fans, pumps, and chiller run and at what speed or capacity. With this configurable intelligency in this \\"brain\\", we are moving to the concept of building automation.Role on DDC Systems in Building Commissioning Building Automation System More complex HVAC systems can interface to Building Automation System (BAS) to allow the building owners to have more control over the heating or cooling units. The building owner can monitor the system and respond to alarms generated by the system from local or remote locations. The system can be scheduled for occupancy or the configuration can be changed from the BAS. Sometimes the BAS is directly controlling the HVAC components. Depending on the BAS different interfaces can be used. Today, there are also dedicated gateways that connect advanced VRV / VRF and Split HVAC Systems with Home Automation and BMS (Building Management Systems) controllers for centralized control and monitoring, obviating the need to purchase more complex and expensive HVAC systems. In addition, such gateway solutions are capable of providing remote control operation of all HVAC indoor units over the internet incorporating a simple and friendly user interface.  Cost and Efficiency  Many people do not have a Heating, Ventilation, and Air Condition (HVAC) system in their homes because it is too expensive. However according to this article Save Money Through Energy Efficiency, HVAC is not as expensive as one may think it is. This article Save Money Through Energy Efficiency tells us that the main thing to look for when shopping for a HVAC system is to make sure it runs efficiently. One thing to always look for when in the market of a new HVAC system is the energy guide sticker on the machine. Although many might choose to not believe that sticker and that it is just there to help with the sales, history shows that many of the newer HVAC systems with the yellow energy guide stickers help save customers hundreds to thousands of dollars depending on how much they use their HVAC system. On the yellow energy guide sticker on many of the newer systems, it displays the average cost to run that machine. Once a customer has found the perfect HVAC system, the customer should run it monthly if it is only put into use during specific times of year. It is recommended that if an HVAC system is not being used each month, that it should be turned on and left running for ten to fifteen minutes. On the other hand if the customer is somebody who runs their HVAC system frequently, it is really important to maintain it. Maintenance on an HVAC system includes changing out the air filter, inspecting the areas where air intake takes place, and check for leaks. Doing these three steps are super essential and is the key to keeping an HVAC system running for a long time. A customer should do these three steps every couple of months or when it is suspected problem with the HVAC system. Some signs that could lead to a potential problem is if the HVAC system does not provide air cool enough. That could be due to a leakage in the cooling fluids. Another sign that could mean that the HVAC system is not running perfectly fine is if there is a bad smell to the air that it is providing. That often means that the air filters need to be replaced. Changing the air filters on an HVAC system is really important because they are exposed to a lot of dust depending on where your HVAC system is and it could build up dust from simply just sitting in one's home.  Design, Modeling, and Marketing  Most HVAC systems are used for the same purpose but designed differently. All HVAC systems have an intake, air filter, and air conditioning liquid. However when designing HVAC systems, many engineers design it for a specific setting and/or purpose. When engineers are designing an HVAC system, they try their best to make it compact while still being able to perform at the highest level and experiment with different ways to make HVAC systems as efficient as possible. Even through all the hardships that come from designing a HVAC system, many Mechanical Engineers in particular have a passion for doing. Although it may be hard to get your sales after designing a new HVAC system, marketing the product is very important. The biggest concern that customers have when in the market looking for a new HVAC system is price and reliability.  HVAC In Homes  Due to the high cost of owning a HVAC system at home, many people do not have one. Although it may be expensive, there are benefits from owning a HVAC system. The main benefit from having an HVAC system installed at home are the health benefits. During the summer season when it is hot, many people would open the windows to allow fresh air in. However there are contaminants from the air coming into your house that can lead to sickness for you and your family. What an HVAC system would help do is filter out all the dirty particles and contaminants and ensure that you are indeed breathing in fresh air. History It was natural that the first HVAC controllers would be pneumatic since engineers understood fluid control. Thus, mechanical engineers could use their experience with the properties of steam and air to control the flow of heated or cooled air. After the control of air flow and temperature was standardized, the use of electromechanical relays in ladder logic to switch dampers became standardized. Eventually, the relays became electronic switches, as transistors eventually could handle greater current loads. By 1985, pneumatic controls could no longer compete with this new technology although pneumatic control systems (sometimes decades old) are still common in many older buildings. By the year 2000, computerized controllers were common. Today, some of these controllers can even be accessed by web browsers, which need no longer be in the same building as the HVAC equipment. This allows some economies of scale, as a single operations center can easily monitor multiple buildings.

Intuitively, a system simulates another system if it can match all of its moves. The basic definition relates states within one transition system, but this is easily adapted to relate two separate transition systems by building a system consisting of the disjoint union of the corresponding components. Formal definition Given a labelled state transition system (S, Œõ, ‚Üí), a simulation relation is a binary relation R over S (i.e. R ‚äÜ S √ó S) such that for every pair of elements (p,q) ‚àà R, for all Œ± ‚àà Œõ, and for all p' ‚àà S, : p \\\\overset{\\\\alpha}{\\\\rightarrow} p' implies that there is a q' ‚àà S such that : q \\\\overset{\\\\alpha}{\\\\rightarrow} q' and (p',q') ‚àà R. Equivalently, in terms of relational composition: :R^{-1}\\\\,; \\\\overset{\\\\alpha}{\\\\rightarrow}\\\\quad {\\\\subseteq}\\\\quad \\\\overset{\\\\alpha}{\\\\rightarrow}\\\\,; R^{-1} Given two states p and q in S, q simulates p, written p ‚â§ q if there is a simulation R such that (p, q) ‚àà R. The relation ‚â§ is a preorder, and is usually called the simulation preorder. It is the largest simulation relation over a given transition system. Two states p and q are said to be similar, written p ‚â§‚â• q, if p simulates q and q simulates p. Similarity is an equivalence relation, but it is coarser than bisimilarity. Similarity of separate transition systems When comparing two different transition systems (S', Œõ', ‚Üí') and (S\\", Œõ\\", ‚Üí\\"), the basic notions of simulation and similarity can be used by forming the disjoint composition of the two machines, (S, Œõ, ‚Üí) with S = S' ‚àê S\\", Œõ = Œõ' ‚à™ Œõ\\" and ‚Üí = ‚Üí' ‚à™ ‚Üí\\", where ‚àê is the disjoint union operator between sets.

He studied, and was also employed as a lab technician, at Bradford College from 1909 to 1911. He won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1947 for his seminal work proving the existence of the ionosphere during experiments carried out in 1924.  Biography  Appleton was born in Bradford, West Riding of Yorkshire, the son of Peter Appleton, a warehouseman, and Mary Wilcock,http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf and was educated at Hanson Grammar School. In 1911, aged 18, he was awarded a scholarship to attend St John‚Äôs College, Cambridge, where he graduated with First Class Honours in Natural Science with Physics in 1913. During the First World War he joined the West Riding Regiment, and later transferred to the Royal Engineers. After returning from active service in the First World War, Appleton became assistant demonstrator in experimental physics at the Cavendish Laboratory in 1920. In 1922 he was initiated into Freemasonry. He was professor of physics at King's College London (1924‚Äì36) and professor of natural philosophy at the University of Cambridge (1936‚Äì39). From 1939 to 1949 he was secretary of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. Knighted in 1941, he received the 1947 Nobel Prize in Physics for his contributions to the knowledge of the ionosphere, which led to the development of radar. From 1949 until his death in 1965, Appleton was Principal and Vice- Chancellor of the University of Edinburgh. In 1956, the BBC invited him to deliver the annual Reith Lectures. Across a series of six radio broadcasts, titled Science and the Nation, he explored the many facets of scientific activity in Britain at the time. Sir Edward is buried in Edinburgh's Morningside CemeteryUniversity of Edinburgh with his wife Helen Lennie (d. 1983). The grave lies towards the extreme western side near the new housing to the north-west.  Works  Appleton had observed that the strength of the radio signal from a transmitter on a frequency such as the medium wave band and over a path of a hundred miles or so was constant during the day but that it varied during the night. This led him to believe that it was possible that two radio signals were being received. One was travelling along the ground, and another was reflected by a layer in the upper atmosphere. The fading or variation in strength of the overall radio signal received resulted from the interference pattern of the two signals. The existence of a reflecting atmospheric layer was not in itself a completely new idea. Balfour Stewart had suggested the idea in the late 19th century to explain rhythmic changes in the earth‚Äôs magnetic field. More recently, in 1902, Oliver Heaviside and Arthur E. Kennelly had suggested such a electromagnetic-reflecting stratum, now called the Kennelly-Heaviside layer, may explain the success Marconi had in transmitting his signals across the Atlantic. Calculations had shown that natural bending of the radio waves was not sufficient to stop them from simply ‚Äúshooting off‚Äù into empty space before they reached the receiver. Appleton thought the best place to look for evidence of the ionosphere was in the variations he believed it was causing around sunset in radio signal receptions. It was sensible to suggest these variations were due to the interference of two waves but an extra step to show that the second wave causing the interference (the first being the ground wave) was coming down from the ionosphere. The experiment he designed had two methods to show ionospheric influence and both allowed the height of the lower boundary of reflection (thus the lower boundary of the reflecting layer) to be determined. The first method was called frequency modulation and the second was to calculate the angle of arrival of the reflected signal at the receiving aerial. The frequency modulation method exploits the fact that there is a path difference between the ground wave and the reflected wave, meaning they travel different distances from sender to receiver. Let the distance AC travelled by the ground wave be h and the distance ABC travelled by the reflected wave h‚Äô. The path difference is: h'-h=D The wavelength of the transmitted signal is Œª. The number of wavelengths difference between the paths h and h‚Äô is: \\\\frac{h-h'}{\\\\lambda}=\\\\frac{D}{\\\\lambda}=N If N is an integer number, then constructive interference will occur, this means a maximum signal will be achieved at the receiving end. If N is an odd integer number of half wavelengths, then destructive interference will occur and a minimum signal will be received. Let us assume we are receiving a maximum signal for a given wavelength Œª. If we start to change Œª, this is the process called frequency modulation, N will no longer be a whole number and destructive interference will start to occur, meaning the signal will start to fade. Now we keep changing Œª until a maximum signal is once again received. The means that for our new value Œª‚Äô, our new value N‚Äô is also an integer number. If we have lengthened Œª then we know that N‚Äô is one less than N. Thus: N-N'=\\\\frac{D}{\\\\lambda}-\\\\frac{D}{\\\\lambda'}=1 Rearranging for D gives: D=h-h'=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda}-\\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda'}} As we know Œª and Œª‚Äô, we can calculate D. Using the approximation that ABC is an isosceles triangle, we can use our value of D to calculate the height of the reflecting layer. This method is a slightly simplified version of the method used by Appleton and his colleagues to work out a first value for the height of the ionosphere in 1924. In their experiment, they used the BBC broadcasting station in Bournemouth to vary the wavelengths of its emissions after the evening programmes had finished. They installed a receiving station in Oxford to monitor the interference effects. The receiving station had to be in Oxford as there was no suitable emitter at the right distance of about 62 miles (100 km) from Cambridge in those days. This frequency modulation method revealed that the point from which waves were being reflected was approximately 56 miles (90 km). However, it did not establish that the waves were reflected from above, indeed they may have been coming from hills somewhere between Oxford and Bournemouth. The second method, which involved finding the angle of incidence of the reflected waves at the receiver, showed for sure that they were coming from above. Triangulations from this angle gave results for the height of reflection compatible with the frequency modulation method. We will not go into this method in detail because it involves fairly complex calculations using Maxwell‚Äôs electromagnetic theory. Far from being conclusive, the success of the Oxford-Bournemouth experiment revealed a vast new field of study to be explored. It showed that there was indeed a reflecting layer high above the earth but it also posed many new questions. What was the constitution of this layer, how did it reflect the waves, was it the same all over the earth, why did its effects change so dramatically between day and night, did it change throughout the year? Appleton would spend the rest of his life answering these questions. He developed a magneto-ionic theory based on the previous work of Lorentz and Maxwell to model the workings of this part of the atmosphere. Using this theory and further experiments, he showed that the so-called Kennelly-Heaviside layer was heavily ionised and thus conducting. This led to the term ionosphere. He showed free electrons to be the ionising agents. He discovered that the layer could be penetrated by waves above a certain frequency and that this critical frequency could be used to calculate the electron density in the layer. However these penetrating waves would also be reflected back, but from a much higher layer. This showed the ionosphere had a much more complex structure than first anticipated. The lower level was labelled E ‚Äì Layer, reflected longer wavelengths and was found to be at approximately 78 miles (125 km). The high level, which had much higher electron density, was labelled F ‚Äì Layer and could reflect much shorter wavelengths that penetrated the lower layer. It is situated 186 ‚Äì 248 miles (300 ‚Äì 400 km) above the earth‚Äôs surface. It is this which is often referred to as the Appleton Layer as is responsible for enabling most long range short wave telecommunication. The magneto-ionic theory also allowed Appleton to explain the origin of the mysterious fadings heard on the radio around sunset. During the day, the light from the sun causes the molecules in the air to become ionised even at fairly low altitudes. At these low altitudes, the density of the air is great and thus the electron density of ionised air is very large. Due to this heavy ionisation, there is strong absorption of electromagnetic waves caused by ‚Äòelectron friction‚Äô. Thus in transmissions over any distance, there will be no reflections as any waves apart from the one at ground level will be absorbed rather than reflected. However, when the sun sets, the molecules slowly start to recombine with their electrons and the free electron density levels drop. This means absorption rates diminish and waves can be reflected with sufficient strengths to be noticed, leading to the interference phenomena we have mentioned. For these interference patterns to occur though, there must not simply be the presence of a reflected wave but a change in the reflected wave. Otherwise the interference is constant and fadings would not be heard. The received signal would simply be louder or softer than during the day. This suggests the height at which reflection happens must slowly change as the sun sets. Appleton found in fact that it increased as the sun set and then decreased as the sun rose until the reflected wave was too weak to record. This variation is compatible with the theory that ionisation is due to the sun‚Äôs influence. At sunset, the intensity of the sun‚Äôs radiation will be much less at the surface of the earth than it is high up in the atmosphere. This means ionic recombination will progress slowly from lower altitudes to higher ones and therefore the height at which waves are reflected slowly increases as the sun sets. The basic idea behind Appleton‚Äôs work is so simple that it is hard to understand at first how he devoted almost all of his scientific career to its study. However, in the last couple of paragraphs some of the complexities of the subject have been introduced. Like many other fields, it is one that grows in intricacy the more it is studied. By the end of his life, ionospheric observatories had been set up all over the world to provide a global map of the reflecting layers. Links were found to the 11 year sunspot cycle and the Aurora Borealis, the magnetic storms that occur in high latitudes. This became particularly relevant during the Second World War when the storms would lead to radio blackouts. Thanks to Appleton‚Äôs research, the periods when these would occur could be predicted and communication could be switched to wavelengths that would be least affected. Radar, another crucial wartime innovation, was one that came about thanks to Appleton‚Äôs work. On a very general level, his research consisted in determining the distance of reflecting objects from radio signal transmitters. This is exactly the idea of radar and the flashing dots that appear on the screen (a cathode ray tube) scanned by the circulating ‚Äòsearcher‚Äô bar. This system was developed partly by Appleton as a new method, called the pulse method, to make ionospheric measurements. It was later adapted by Robert Watson-Watt to detect aeroplanes. Nowadays, ionospheric data is important when communications with satellites are considered. The correct frequencies for these signals must be selected so that they actually reach the satellites without being reflected or deviated before. In 1974 the Radio and Space Research Station was renamed the Appleton Laboratory in honour of the man who had done so much to establish the UK as a leading force in ionospheric research, and had been involved with the station first as a researcher and then as secretary of its parent body, the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.

He was born in Chamb√©ry, Savoy, but educated in Lyon by the Jesuits. He used to work in the royal library with Antoine Varillas. This French historiographer influenced the way Saint-R√©al wrote history.About the biography of Saint-R√©al see : Andr√©e Mansau, Saint-R√©al et l'humanisme cosmopolite, Lille, Atelier de reproduction des th√®ses, 1996 He used to be reader and friend of Hortense Mancini, duchesse de Mazarin, who took him with her to England (1675). Saint- R√©al was a polygraph writer. His works belong to different genres but he always had an interest in history. After some minor works written in order to win the protection of Louis XIV, he wrote De l'usage de l'histoire in 1671. In this essay, he speaks about the good way of writing history and explains that understanding of facts is more important than facts themselves. In 1672, he published Dom Carlos, subtitled \\"nouvelle historique\\". It's a short novel or a long short story which relates the love story of a forbidden passion between Dom Carlos, the son of Philip II of Spain, and his father's wife Elisabeth of Valois. Saint-R√©al mixes politics and love, but love appears much more important. This novel was a hit with high society. Nowadays French critics see it as an important text in the construction of the French psychological novel. It announces the style of Madame de La Fayette novels. Dom Carlos was the basis for Friedrich Schiller‚Äôs play Don Carlos (which in turn became the source material for several operatic works, including Giuseppe Verdi‚Äôs opera of the same name). Saint-R√©al‚Äôs book was also the basis of the English writer Thomas Otway‚Äôs play Don Carlos, Prince of Spain. But Saint-R√©al wanted to be a serious writer and needed to write texts which were not fiction. That's why he published in 1674 la Conjuration des Espagnols contre la R√©publique de Venise en l'ann√©e M. DC. XVIII. It relates a Spanish conjuration against Venice. The historical work is not serious by modern criteria, but it was regarded by people of the end of the 17th and the 18th centuries as a good example of classical prosis. In Le Si√®cle de Louis XIV, Voltaire calls Saint-R√©al the \\"French Sallust\\" because of this work. The authorship of the duchess's M√©moires has been ascribed to Saint-Real, but no proof exists. He also wrote a Vie de J√©sus Christ in 1678, a summary of the gospels. He took part in the literary arguments of his time with the short treatise De la critique (1691), directed against Andry de Boisregard's R√©flexions sur la langue fran√ßaise. There were many editions of his≈íuvres compl√®tes during the 17th and 19th centuries, some longer than others due to the inclusion of some works falsely attributed to him.

Early life  Powell was born in Tonbridge, Kent, England, the son of a local gunsmith, and educated at a local primary school before gaining a scholarship to the Judd School, Tonbridge, which had one of its four houses named after Powell (the house colour is green), from 2008-2017. To this day the school awards the Powell Physics and Mathematics Prize to an upper sixth form student every year in his honour (in addition Powell is honoured by the local branch of Pizza Express, which is dedicated to him and a portrait of Powell hangs in the restaurant). Following this he attended Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, graduating in 1925 in Natural Sciences. After completing his bachelor's degree he worked at the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge, under C.T.R. Wilson and Lord Rutherford, conducting research into condensation phenomena, and gaining his PhD in Physics in 1929.Cambridge University Library  Professional life  In 1928 he took up a post as Research Assistant to A.M. Tyndall in the H.H. Wills Physical Laboratory at the University of Bristol, later being appointed lecturer, and in 1948 appointed Melville Wills Professor of Physics. In 1932 Powell married Isobel Artner (1907-1995), and the couple had two daughters. In 1936 he took part in an expedition to the West Indies as part of a study of volcanic activity, and where he appears on a stamp issued in Grenada. During his time at Bristol University, Powell applied himself to the development of techniques for measuring the mobility of positive ions, to establishing the nature of the ions in common gases, and to the construction and use of a Cockcroft generator to study the scattering of atomic nuclei. He also began to develop methods employing specialised photographic emulsions to facilitate the recording of the tracks of elementary particles, and in 1938 began applying this technique to the study of cosmic radiation, exposing photographic plates at high-altitude, at the tops of mountains and using specially designed balloons, collaborating in the study with Giuseppe Occhialini, H. Muirhead and young Brazilian physicist C√©sar Lattes. This work led in 1946 to the discovery of the pion (pi-meson), which proved to be the hypothetical particle proposed in 1935 by Yukawa Hideki in his theory of nuclear physics. Memorial bench and plaque dedicated to Powell at the site of his death in the foothills of the Alps, Italy. In 1949 Powell became a Fellow of the Royal Society and received the society's Hughes Medal the same year. In 1950 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics \\"for his development of the photographic method of studying nuclear processes and his discoveries regarding mesons made with this method\\" although the Brazilian Cesar Lattes be the first author and the real responsible of the discovery. Debendra Mohan (DM) Bose [nephew of Sir J.C. Bose] and Chowdhuri published three consecutive papers in Nature, but could not continue further investigation on account of \\"non-availability of more sensitive emulsion plates during the war years. Seven years after this discovery of mesons by DM Bose and Bibha Chowdhuri, C.F. Powell made the same discovery of pions and muons and further decay of muons to electrons‚Ä¶ using the same technique\\". He acknowledged in his book, \\"In 1941, Bose and Chaudhuri (sic) had pointed it out that it is possible, in principle, to distinguish between the tracks of protons and mesons in an emulsion‚Ä¶ They concluded that many of the charged particles arrested in their plates were lighter than protons, their mean mass being ‚Ä¶ the physical basis of their method was correct and their work represents the first approach to the scattering method of determining momenta of charged particles by observation of their tracks in emulsion\\". In fact, the measured mass of the particle by Bose and Chowdhuri was very close to the accepted value measured by Powell who used improved \\"full-tone\\" plates. From 1952 Powell was appointed director of several expeditions to Sardinia and the Po Valley, Italy, utilizing high-altitude balloon flights. In 1955, Powell, also a member of the World Federation of Scientific Workers, added his signature to the Russell-Einstein Manifesto put forward by Bertrand Russell, Albert Einstein and scientist Joseph Rotblat, and was involved in preparations for the first Pugwash Conference on Science and World Affairs. As Rotblat put it, \\"Cecil Powell has been the backbone of the Pugwash Movement. He gave it coherence, endurance and vitality.\\" Powell chaired the meetings of the Pugwash Continuing Committee, often standing in for Bertrand Russell, and attended meetings until 1968. In 1961 Powell received the Royal Medal, and served on the Scientific Policy Committee of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) that year, and in 1967 he was awarded the Lomonosov Gold Medal by the Academy of Sciences of the USSR (now Russian Academy of Sciences) \\"for outstanding achievements in the physics of elementary particles\\". Powell died on 9 August 1969, whilst out walking in the foothills of the Alps near the Valsassina region of Italy, where he had been staying with friends. A bench with commemorative plaque was erected near the site of his death.  Cecil F. Powell Memorial Medal  * The Cecil F.

They were originally written for the guidance and instruction of monks in \\"the practice of the contemplative life\\".Ware (1979), pp. 14-15. The collection was compiled in the 18th century by Nicodemus the Hagiorite and Macarius of Corinth based on the codices 472 (12th century), 605 (13th century), 476 (14th century), 628 (14th century) and 629 (15th century) from the library of monastery of Vatopedi, Mount Athos. Although these works were individually known in the monastic culture of Greek Orthodox Christianity before their inclusion in the Philokalia, their presence in this collection resulted in a much wider readership due to its translation into several languages. The earliest translations included a Church Slavonic language translation of selected texts by Paisius Velichkovsky (Dobrotolublye, –î–æ–±—Ä–æ—Ç–æ–ª—éÃÅ–±—ó–µ) in 1793, a Russian translation by Ignatius Bryanchaninov in 1857, and a five-volume translation into Russian (Dobrotolyubie) by Theophan the Recluse in 1877.

The book is a \\"principal spiritual text\\" for all the Eastern Orthodox churches. The publishers of the current English translation state that \\"the Philokalia has exercised an influence far greater than that of any book other than the Bible in the recent history of the Orthodox Church.\\"Ware (1979), Publisher's blurb from back cover. Philokalia (sometimes Philocalia) is also the name given to an anthology of the writings of Origen compiled by Basil of Caesarea and Gregory of Nazianzus. Other works on monastic spirituality have also used the same title over the years. English translation online here History Nikodemos and Makarios were monks at Mt. Athos, a mountainous peninsula in northern Greece, historically considered the geographical center of Orthodox spirituality and home to 20 monasteries. The first edition, in Greek, was published in Venice in 1782, with a second Greek edition published in Athens in 1893. All the original texts were in Greek‚Äîtwo of them were first written in Latin and translated into Greek in the Byzantine era. Paisius Velichkovsky's translation into Church Slavonic, Dobrotolublye (published in Moscow in 1793), included selected portions of the Philokalia and was the version that the pilgrim in The Way of a Pilgrim carried on his journey. That book about a Russian pilgrim who is seeking advice on interior prayer helped popularize the Philokalia and its teachings in Russia. Velichkovsky's translation was the first to become widely read by the public, away from the monasteries‚Äîhelped by the popularity of The Way of a Pilgrim, and the public influence of the startsy at Optina Monastery known as the Optina Elders. Two Russian language translations appeared in the 19th century, one by Ignatius Brianchaninov (1857) and another by Theophan the Recluse's Dobrotolubiye (1877). The latter was published in five volumes and included texts that were not in the original Greek edition. Velichkovsky was initially hesitant to share his translation outside of the Optina Monastery walls. He was concerned that people living in the world would not have the adequate supervision and guidance of the startsy in the monastery, nor would they have the support of the liturgical life of the monks. He was finally persuaded by the Metropolitan of St. Petersburg to publish the book in 1793. Brianchanivov expressed the same concerns in his work, warning his readers that regular practice of the Jesus Prayer, without adequate guidance, could potentially cause spiritual delusion and pride, even among monks. Their concerns were contrary to the original compiler of the Philokalia, Nicodemos, who wrote that the Jesus Prayer could be used to good effect by anyone, whether monastic or layperson. All agreed that the teachings on constant inner prayer should be practiced under the guidance of a spiritual teacher, or starets.Johnson (2010), p. 38. The first partial English and French translations in the 1950s were an indirect result of the Bolshevik revolution, which brought many Russian intellectuals into Western Europe. T. S. Eliot persuaded his fellow directors of the publishing house Faber and Faber to publish a partial translation into English from the Theophan Russian version, which met with surprising success in 1951. A more complete English translation, from the original Greek, began in 1979 with a collaboration between G. E. H. Palmer, Kallistos Ware, and Philip Sherrard. They released four of the five volumes of the Philokalia between 1979 and 1995. In 1946, the first installment of a ten volume Romanian translation by Father Dumitru StƒÉniloae appeared. In addition to the original Greek text, StƒÉniloae added \\"lengthy original footnotes of his own\\" as well as substantially expanding the coverage of texts by Saint John of the Ladder, Saint Dorotheos of Gaza, Maximus the Confessor, Symeon the New Theologian, and Gregory Palamas. This work is 4,650 pages in length.Binns, John. An Introduction to the Orthodox Christian Churches (2002). Cambridge University Press, pp. 92-93. Writings by the Trappist monk Thomas Merton on hesychasm also helped spread the popularity of the Philokalia, along with the indirect influence of J. D. Salinger's Franny and Zooey, which featured The Way of a Pilgrim as a main plot element.Johnson (2010), pp. 41-42. Teachings The collection's title is The Philokalia of the Niptic Fathers,Ware (1979) pp. 367-368 or more fully The Philokalia of the Neptic Saints gathered from our Holy Theophoric Father, through which, by means of the philosophy of ascetic practice and contemplation, the intellect is purified, illumined, and made perfect. Niptic is an adjective derived from the Greek Nipsis (or Nepsis) referring to contemplative prayer and meaning \\"watchfulness\\". Watchfulness in this context includes close attention to one's thoughts, intentions, and emotions, with the aim of resisting temptations and vain and egoistic thoughts, and trying to maintain a constant state of remembrance of God. There are similarities between this ancient practice and the concept of mindfulness as practiced in Buddhism and other spiritual traditions. The Philokalia teachings have also influenced the revival of interior prayer in modern times through the centering prayer practices taught by Thomas Keating and Thomas Merton. Philokalia is defined as the \\"love of the beautiful, the exalted, the excellent, understood as the transcendent source of life and the revelation of Truth.\\"Ware (1979), p. 13. In contemplative prayer the mind becomes absorbed in the awareness of God as a living presence as the source of being of all creatures and sensible forms. According to the authors of the English translation, Kallistos Ware, G. E. H. Palmer, and Philip Sherrard, the writings of the Philokalia have been chosen above others because they: > ...show the way to awaken and develop attention and consciousness, to attain > that state of watchfulness which is the hallmark of sanctity. They describe > the conditions most effective for learning what their authors call the art > of arts and the science of sciences, a learning which is not a matter of > information or agility of mind but of a radical change of will and heart > leading man towards the highest possibilities open to him, shaping and > nourishing the unseen part of his being, and helping him to spiritual > fulfilment and union with God.\\" The Philokalia is the foundational text on hesychasm (\\"quietness\\" or \\"stillness\\"), an inner spiritual tradition with a long history dating back to the Desert Fathers. The practices include contemplative prayer, quiet sitting, and recitation of the Jesus Prayer. While traditionally taught and practiced in monasteries, hesychasm teachings have spread over the years to include laymen. Nikodemos, in his introduction, described the collected texts as \\"a mystical school of inward prayer\\" which could be used to cultivate the inner life and to \\"attain the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.\\" While the monastic life makes this easier, Nikodemos himself stressed that \\"unceasing prayer\\" should be practiced by all. The hesychasm teachings in the Philokalia are viewed by Orthodox Christians as inseparable from the sacraments and liturgy of the Orthodox Church, and are given by and for those who are already living within the framework of the Church. A common theme is the need for a spiritual father or guide.Ware (1979), p. 16. Timeline of editions and translations * 4th-15th centuries The original texts are written by various spiritual masters.

Gaullism claim to transcend the left-right divide (in a similar way to populist republican parties elsewhere such as Fianna F√°il in Republic of Ireland) but in practice the current Gaullist party is the centre-right Republicans. In the past, some Gaullist voters saw themselves as leaning towards the left‚Äîa view ascribed to the once-leading Gaullist Andr√© Malraux. However, most of Charles de Gaulle's own followers leaned towards the right-leaning national conservative. Consequently left-leaning voters started showing less support again after Malraux's death in 1976, as figures of the Gaullist left (like Jacques Chaban-Delmas) were gradually marginalised. Under its various names and acronyms, the Gaullist Party has been the dominant organisation of the French right since the beginning of the Fifth Republic (1958).  De Gaulle vs. the parties (1944‚Äì1947)  Author of the L'Appel of 18 June 1940, and founder and leader of the Free French Forces, General Charles de Gaulle is the symbol of the French Resistance to the Nazi occupation and the Vichy government. Yet, based in London, then in Algiers, he was forced to compromise with the domestic Resistance movements dominated by various political forces (such as the Communists). In 1944, while France was liberated, De Gaulle presided over the provisional government composed of Communists, Socialists, and Christian Democrats. Because De Gaulle refused to create a great political party unifying the non-Communist Resistance, a lot of parties re-emerged. The Christian democratic Popular Republican Movement (MRP) seemed to be the closest to De Gaulle. The provisional government implemented policies inspired by the programme of the National Council of Resistance: nationalization of banks and some industrial companies (for example Renault), and the development of a Welfare State. However, it was divided about the way forward for political institutions and the constitution for the Fourth Republic. For De Gaulle, the \\"regime of the parties\\" that had characterized the Third Republic was a cause of the 1940 military disaster. He advocated a strong executive power, governing in the national interest, led by a man who was an incarnation of national unity. Indeed, in his mind, France is strong when it is united and the parties, represented in Parliament, serve particular interests and thus express national divisions. In November 1945, a large majority of the French voters accepted the elaboration of a new Constitution. At the same time, they elected a new National Assembly. The French Communist Party, the Socialist French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) and the Christian democratic MRP were the largest forces represented in this Assembly. It re-elected de Gaulle as president of the provisional government but, disagreeing with restoration of the \\"regime of the parties\\", de Gaulle resigned in January 1946. In May 1946, a first constitutional law was rejected by referendum. One month later, a new Assembly was elected in order to write a new constitutional text. In his Bayeux Manifesto, De Gaulle outlined his institutional ideas but he was accused of wanting re-establish a Bonapartist government. Furthermore, without the support of a political force, he could not influence the constitutional law being prepared. Ren√© Capitant founded a Gaullist Union for the Fourth Republic but it could not prevent the approval of the text prepared by the elected Assembly, which restored the parliamentary system.  Gaullist Party and Fourth Republic: opposition and desert crossing (1947‚Äì1958)  In 1947, he gathered the anti-Communist opposition in the Rally of the French People (Rassemblement du peuple fran√ßais or RPF). He accused the Fourth Republic of being dominated by the \\"parliamentary fiddles\\" and to organize the state helplessness. In keeping with its strongly nationalist stance, it accused the French Communist Party of being a vassal of the Soviet Union. Furthermore, it denounced what it called the \\"abandonment\\" of colonies by the Third Force cabinets, and it viewed French participation in the European Economic Community to be a threat to the nation. In addition, the Gaullists recommended an association between capital and labour in order to end the \\"struggle of classes\\", which hampered national unity. Six months after its founding, membership of the RPF reached one million. It took control of the executive of many cities, including Paris, Marseille and Bordeaux. After the 1951 legislative election and in despite of the change of the ballot system, the RPF formed the largest parliamentary group of the Assembly. But it made a systematic opposition. In 1952, some RPF deputies voted in favour of Antoine Pinay's cabinet then joined the majority, against the instructions of De Gaulle. They left the RPF parliamentary group. More and more divided, the RPF suffered a significant decrease in support in the 1953 local elections. On 6 May 1953, De Gaulle asked to the Gaullist deputies to abandon the name \\"RPF\\". One month later, 5 Gaullist deputies joined Joseph Laniel's government. Indeed, they participated to right-wing majorities then, a part of the Gaullists as Jacques Chaban-Delmas joined the center-left Republican Front under the label National Centre of Social Republicans (Centre national des r√©publicains sociaux or CNRS). At the end of the 1950s, the Fourth Republic floundered in the Algerian War. The 13 May 1958 crisis led to turmoil, and a threat of military coup was brandished. Emissaries sent by de Gaulle such as [Jacques Soustelle participated in this bustle. The National Assembly accepted to call back De Gaulle to lead the cabinet. On 28 September, a new constitution was approved by referendum and the Fifth Republic was born. The parliamentary system was not questioned, but the presidential function was enhanced.  Gaullist Party's height (1958‚Äì1976)  In order that he should not be faced with an hostile Assembly, dominated by the parties (as was the case in 1945‚Äì1946), De Gaulle let his followers organize a political party, the Union for the New Republic (Union pour la nouvelle r√©publique or UNR). After the November 1958 legislative election, it became the largest force in the political system. It was allied with center-left and center-right parties to support De Gaulle, who was elected President of France by a congress of local and national elects in December 1958. Michel Debr√© was nominated as Prime minister. However, the change of Algerian policy divided the party. The chairman of the National Assembly Jacques Chaban-Delmas considered Algeria was a part of the presidential \\"reserved domain\\", as well as foreign and military affairs. Soustelle, leader of the pro-French Algeria faction in the party, left the cabinet in 1960, then was ejected from the UNR. He joined Georges Bidault at the head of the Organisation arm√©e secr√®te which perpetrated terrorist attacks. After this crisis, the UNR appeared as the party of de Gaulle's unconditional supporters, hence its reputation of \\"boot party\\". Debr√© theorized its function of strap of the government. With De Gaulle refusing to be a party leader, Debr√© covertly took this position. Meanwhile, the center- left parties returned to the opposition in 1959, followed in 1962 by the center-right parties, who criticized the eurosceptic declarations of De Gaulle and the \\"presidentialisation\\". Indeed, De Gaulle instituted presidential election by universal suffrage, defying all the political forces (except UNR). The French voters approved this by referendum. De Gaulle had intended to replace Debr√© with Georges Pompidou as Prime minister but this was denied by a vote of no-confidence. De Gaulle dissolved the National Assembly. Associated with the left-wing Gaullists of the Democratic Union of Labour (Union d√©mocratique du travail or UDT), and allied with Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing's Independent Republicans, the UNR won the 1962 legislative election and Pompidou was confirmed to lead the cabinet. Naturally, the UNR/UDT supported De Gaulle's candidature at the 1965 presidential election. But he won only after a second ballot, which he considered as a disavowal. Relations became more difficult with the only allied party in the presidential majority, the Independent Republicans, while the opposition was reconstructed. While the Democratic Center intensified its criticism, some Christian-Democrats, such Maurice Schumann, joined the Gaullist Party, renamed Union of Democrats for the Fifth Republic (Union des d√©mocrates pour la Cinqui√®me R√©publique or UD- Ve). Prime Minister Pompidou led the party during the 1967 legislative campaign. He encouraged the emergence of a new generation of Gaullist politicians who were loyal to him. The incumbent parliamentary majority only just won. One year later, Gaullist power was confronted with the social and student May 1968 crisis. Although the newly renamed Union for the Defense of the Republic (Union pour la d√©fense de la R√©publique or UDR) triumphed at the June 1968 legislative election, disagreements had appeared between De Gaulle and Pompidou. Pompidou reproached De Gaulle for leaving the country without informing him, during the crisis. For De Gaulle, his project of association between capital and labour could prevent this sort of social crisis, but Pompidou wished scrap it. Indeed, for De Gaulle's circle, Pompidou was more a classical conservative than a real Gaullist. Pompidou left the leadership of the cabinet in order to prepare his future presidential campaign. In this, he declared his candidacy if De Gaulle were to resign. That was the case in 1969, after the failure of the referendum about Senate and regional reform, and he won the 1969 presidential election despite the reluctance of some of the \\"barons of Gaullism\\". His Prime Minister Jacques Chaban-Delmas announced a reform programme for a \\"New Society\\". It raised sceptical reactions from the conservative wing of the UDR, then from Pompidou himself. They reproached him for giving too many concessions to the left-wing opposition. In President Pompidou's circle, he was accused of wanting to weaken the presidential functions in favour of himself. The party became the Union of Democrats for the Republic (Union des d√©mocrates pour la R√©publique) while this crisis broke out. Pompidou refused Chaban-Delmas a vote of confidence in the National Assembly and, when he held it anyway, Pompidou forced him to resign and nominated Pierre Messmer. The UDR, allied with the Independent Republicans and Centre, Democracy and Progress, won the 1973 legislative election and succeeded in blocking the \\"Union of the Left\\" and its Common Programme. When Pompidou died in office, on 2 April 1974, his two former Prime Ministers, Chaban-Delmas and Messmer, claimed the UDR candidacy for the presidential election. Finally, the latter withdrew, but some influential personalities in the party, notably in the circle of the late president, doubted of the capacity of Chaban-Delmas to defeat Fran√ßois Mitterrand, the representative of the \\"Union of the Left\\". Behind the young minister Jacques Chirac, a former adviser of Pompidou, they published the Call of the 43. They covertly supported Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing, Minister of Economy and the Independent Republicans's leader. Giscard eliminated Chaban-Delmas in the first round, then narrowly defeated Mitterrand in the second. He was the first non-Gaullist President of the Fifth Republic. Chirac became Prime minister and became the leader of the UDR in December 1974, in spite of the negative opinions of many historical Gaullist personalities (Michel Debr√©, Jacques Chaban-Delmas, etc.). They accused him of having betrayed the party during the previous presidential campaign. Some months later, a conflict broke out between the executive leadership and Chirac left the cabinet in August 1976.  Chirac-led neo- Gaullist party: the RPR and UMP (1976-2007)  In December 1976, the UDR was replaced by the Rally for the Republic (Rassemblement pour la R√©publique or RPR). This name was chosen due to its similarity with the RPF. Indeed, the New Gaullist Party was devised as a machine of reconquest behind one man, Jacques Chirac. Without withdrawing from the presidential majority, the RPR criticized the executive duo of President Giscard d'Estaing and Prime minister Raymond Barre. In December 1978, six months before the 1979 European Parliament election, the Call of Cochin denounced the appropriation of France by \\"the foreign party\\", which sacrificed the national interests and the independence of the country in order to build a federal Europe. This accusation targeted clearly Giscard d'Estaing. The RPR contrasted the social doctrine of Gaullism to the president's liberalism. The RPR supported Chirac in the 1981 presidential election but he was eliminated in the first round. He refused to give instructions for voting for the second round, even if he said \\"in a private capacity\\", he would vote for Giscard d'Estaing. In fact, the RPR was suspected of working for the defeat of the incumbent president. While the Socialist Party leader Fran√ßois Mitterrand became President, the RPR gradually abandoned the Gaullist doctrine, adopting the European and liberal positions of the Union for French Democracy (Union pour la d√©mocratie fran√ßaise or UDF). The two parties competed for the leadership of the right-wing opposition, but they presented a common list at the 1984 European Parliament election and a platform to prepare for winning the 1986 legislative election. From 1986 to 1988, Chirac \\"cohabited\\" as Prime minister with Mitterrand, but lost the 1988 presidential election. After his defeat, his leadership was challenged by younger politicians who wished to renew the right. Furthermore, the abandonment of the Gaullist doctrine was criticized by Charles Pasqua and Philippe S√©guin. They tried to remove him from the RPR leadership in 1990, in vain. However, the division re-appeared with the 1992 Maastricht referendum. Chirac voted \\"yes\\" whereas S√©guin and Pasqua campaigned for \\"no\\". The \\"Union for France\\", a RPR/UDF coalition, won the 1993 legislative election. Chirac refused to re-cohabit with Mitterrand, and his confidente Edouard Balladur became Prime minister. Balladur promised he would not be a candidate in the 1995 presidential election. Nevertheless, polls indicated Balladur was the favorite in the presidential race and furthermore, he was supported by the majority of right-wing politicians. He decided finally to be a candidate against Chirac. However, they claimed they remained \\"friends for 30 years\\". The Socialists being weakened after the 14 years of Mitterrand's presidency, the main contest was the competition in the right, between Balladur and Chirac, two Neo-Gaullists. Balladur proposed a neoliberal programme and took advantage of the \\"positive results\\" of his cabinet, whereas Chirac advocated Keynesianism to reduce the \\"social fracture\\" and criticized the \\"dominant ideas\\", targeting Balladur. Chirac won the 1995 presidential election. In November 1995, his Prime Minister Alain Jupp√©, \\"the best among us\\" according to Chirac, announced a plan of Welfare-State reforms which sparked wide social conflict. President Chirac dissolved the National Assembly and lost the 1997 legislative election. He was forced to cohabit with a left-wing cabinet led by Lionel Jospin until 2002. S√©guin succeeded Jupp√© as RPR leader. But, he criticized the ascendancy of President Chirac over the party. He resigned during the 1999 European election campaign, while Pasqua presented a dissident list to advocate the Gaullist idea of a \\"Europe of nations\\". Pasqua founded the Rally for France (Rassemblement pour la France or RPF) and obtained more votes than the RPR official list led by Nicolas Sarkozy. Mich√®le Alliot-Marie was elected RPR leader, against the wishes of President Chirac who supported another candidate. Before the 2002 presidential election, RPR and non-RPR supporters of Chirac gathered in an association: the \\"Union on the move\\". It became the Union for the Presidential Majority (Union pour la majorit√© pr√©sidentielle or UMP) after the 21 April electoral shock. Chirac was re- elected and the new party won the legislative election. It was renamed Union for a Popular Movement a few months later, establishing the UMP as a permanent organization. Chirac finished his presidency in 2007 after 12 years ruled.  Nicolas Sarkozy era (2007-2017)  Nicolas Sarkozy was elected President of France in 2007. During his leadership, the gaullist party shift to the right with more conservative policies. Sarkozy was defeated in 2012. Despite defeat, Sarkozy remained influence in the party politics. He became then-President of the UMP in 2014 and renamed the gaullist party into Republicans in 2015. However in 2016, Sarkozy was defeated in the presidential primaries.  Laurent Wauquiez era (2017-present)  Laurent Wauquiez was selected as leader of the Republicans in 2017. Since then the party has moved to further right.

Ewen and Edward M. Purcell at the Lyman Laboratory of Physics at Harvard University in 1951 for the first detection of radio radiation from nuclear atomic hydrogen gas in the Milky Way at a wavelength of 21 cm. Now at National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, WV. Edward Mills Purcell (August 30, 1912 ‚Äì March 7, 1997) was an American physicist who shared the 1952 Nobel Prize for Physics for his independent discovery (published 1946) of nuclear magnetic resonance in liquids and in solids. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has become widely used to study the molecular structure of pure materials and the composition of mixtures. Friends and colleagues knew him as Ed Purcell. Biography Born and raised in Taylorville, Illinois, Purcell received his BSEE in electrical engineering from Purdue University, followed by his M.A. and Ph.D. in physics from Harvard University. He was a member of the Alpha Xi chapter of the Phi Kappa Sigma fraternity while at Purdue. After spending the years of World War II working at the MIT Radiation Laboratory on the development of microwave radar, Purcell returned to Harvard to do research. In December 1946, he discovered nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) with his colleagues Robert Pound and Henry Torrey. NMR provides scientists with an elegant and precise way of determining chemical structure and properties of materials, and is widely used in physics and chemistry. It also is the basis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), one of the most important medical advances of the 20th century. For his discovery of NMR, Purcell shared the 1952 Nobel Prize in physics with Felix Bloch of Stanford University. Purcell also made contributions to astronomy as the first to detect radio emissions from neutral galactic hydrogen (the famous 21 cm line due to hyperfine splitting), affording the first views of the spiral arms of the Milky Way. This observation helped launch the field of radio astronomy, and measurements of the 21 cm line are still an important technique in modern astronomy. He has also made seminal contributions to solid state physics, with studies of spin-echo relaxation, nuclear magnetic relaxation, and negative spin temperature (important in the development of the laser). With Norman F. Ramsey, he was the first to question the CP symmetry of particle physics. Purcell was the recipient of many awards for his scientific, educational, and civic work. He served as science advisor to Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, and Lyndon B. Johnson. He was president of the American Physical Society, and a member of the American Philosophical Society, the National Academy of Sciences, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1979, and the Jansky Lectureship before the National Radio Astronomy Observatory. Purcell was also inducted into his Fraternity's (Phi Kappa Sigma) Hall of Fame as the first Phi Kap ever to receive a Nobel Prize. Purcell was the author of the innovative introductory text Electricity and Magnetism'. The book, a Sputnik-era project funded by an NSF grant, was influential for its use of relativity in the presentation of the subject at this level. The 1965 edition, now freely available due to a condition of the federal grant, was originally published as a volume of the Berkeley Physics Course. The book is also in print as a commercial third edition, as Purcell and Morin. Purcell is also remembered by biologists for his famous lecture \\"Life at Low Reynolds Number\\", in which he explained forces and effects dominating in limiting flow regimes (often at the micro scale). He also emphasized the time-reversibility of low Reynolds number flows with a principle referred to as the Scallop theorem.

In 1955, the Nobel Committee gave a divided Nobel Prize for Physics, with one half to going to Kusch for his accurate determination that the magnetic moment of the electron was greater than its theoretical value, thus leading to reconsideration of--and innovations in--quantum electrodynamics. (The other 1955 physics laureate was Willis Eugene Lamb, who won for his work on the spectrum of hydrogen.) Early life and education Kusch was born in Blankenburg, Germany to John Mathias Kusch, a Lutheran missionary, and his wife, Henrietta van der Haas. In 1912, Kusch and his family had emigrated to the United States, where by 1922 he became a naturalized citizen. After graduating from grade school in Mid-west, Kusch attended Case Institute of Technology in Cleveland, Ohio (now known as Case Western Reserve University), where he majored physics. After graduating from the Case Western Reserve University with bachelor of science degree in 1931, Kusch joined University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, from where he received his master's degree in 1933. He continued his education at the same alma mater, studying for his Ph.D. under mentorship from F. Wheeler Loomis and after defending his thesis titled \\"The Molecular Spectrum of Caesium and Rubidium\\", graduated from it in 1936. In 1935, prior to moving to the University of Minnesota, Kusch married his girlfriend, Edith Starr Roberts. Together, they had three daughters. Career Kusch then moved to New York City, where from 1937 and until his departure for the newly founded University of Texas at Dallas, he spent much of his career as a professor at Columbia University, and served as the university's provost for several years. He worked on molecular beam resonance studies under I. I. Rabi, then discovered the electron anomalous magnetic moment. Many measurements of magnetic moments and hyperfine structure followed. He expanded into chemical physics and continued to publish research on molecular beams. During his tenure at Columbia, he was the doctoral supervisor for Gordon Gould, the inventor of the laser. Kusch was a fellow of the American Physical Society since 1940 and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences since 1959. He was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1956. Kusch's wife Edith died in 1959, and in the following year he married Betty Pezzoni. They had two daughters. Kusch House, a residential dormitory for undergraduate students at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio on the South Campus is named after Kusch. It is located on Carlton Road in Cleveland Heights. The University of Texas at Dallas has a Polykarp Kusch Auditorium with a plaque. His widow Betty died in 2003, aged 77.

Foundation The RPF was founded by Charles de Gaulle in Strasbourg on 14 April 1947,William George Andrews, Stanley Hoffmann (editors), The Impact of the Fifth Republic on France, page 6 (State University of New York Press, 1981). one year after his resignation from the presidency of the provisional government and four months after the proclamation of the Fourth Republic. It advocated a constitutional revision in order to institute a presidential government. Indeed, for de Gaulle, the \\"regime of the parties\\" which characterized the parliamentary system, did not permit the advent of a strong and efficient state. However, in French Republican culture, democracy and parliamentary sovereignty were inseparable. De Gaulle was accused of wanting to establish a Bonapartist government, with himself as a single dominant rule.Martin Kolinsky, Continuity and Change in European Society: Germany, France and Italy Since 1870, page 172 (Redwood Burn Limited, 1974). A resolute opponent of the parties (as in his mind, they served particular interests and divided the nation), de Gaulle wanted the RPF to be a rally, not a political party and allowed members of other parties (except Communists and former Vichy regime supporters) to join without compromising their other membership, but this hope was never realized. By 1948, the party counted half a million members, just behind the Communist Party. The RPF was able to gain the support of Maurrasien royalists (of the Action Fran√ßaise), leftist republicans (Andr√© Malraux), moderates, christian democrats (Edmond Michelet), radicals (Jacques Chaban-Delmas, Michel Debr√©), and even socialists and communists. Nevertheless, most of its voters came from the right-wing electorate. Electoral record The party enjoyed success in municipal elections (1947), capturing the cities of Lille, Marseille, Bordeaux (with Jacques Chaban-Delmas), Strasbourg, Rennes, Versailles, Le Mans, and Nancy with over 35% of votes. In Paris in 1947, Pierre de Gaulle, the brother of the General, became President of the municipal council, a post similar to mayor.Ton van der Eyden, Public Management of Society: Rediscovering French Institutional Engineering in the European Context, Volume 1, page 102, (Amsterdam: IOS Press, 2003). However, the RPF's performance in the Christian Democratic MRP strongholds of rural France was relatively mediocre. Parliamentarians hostile to the RPF delayed cantonal elections in the fear of another Gaullist breakthrough. The hostility of the media and the social events of 1947 limited the party's electoral success. The 1949 cantonal elections, albeit delayed in fear of an RPF breakthrough, produced another RPF victory (although smaller than the victory in the municipal elections). The 1951 election was a relative success for the RPF, but the electoral law (apparentements), created to favor the Third Force coalition (MRP, SFIO, RGR etc.) over the anti-Fourth Republic parties (RPF and the Communists), limited the Gaullist breakthrough. It obtained over 4 million votes (22.3%) and 117 seats. It had hoped for over 200 seats, but the apparentements system limited that. Political defeats With only 117 seats, the RPF had little influence on decision making in the new Assembly. In 1952, 27 deputies voted in favor of Antoine Pinay's government before being excluded. Later, 45 other deputies left the Gaullist party. Following the loss of numerous cities (Marseille, Lille) in the 1953 municipal elections, the party's decline started. Many people blamed its defeats on the authoritarian handling by party leadership. De Gaulle asked to the Gaullist deputies to abandon the name \\"RPF\\", then in June 1953, 5 Gaullist deputies joined Joseph Laniel's government. In 1954, the vote of Gaullists and Communists lead to the defeat of the European Defence Community treaty. On 13 September 1955 the party was officially dissolved.Vishnu Bhagwan, Vidya Bhushan, World Constitutions - A Comparative Study, page 432 (Sterling Publishers, 2008, eighth revised edition). The Gaullist deputies founded the National Centre of Social Republicans without the backing of De Gaulle. Most would go on to form the Union for the New Republic and help in the creation of the Fifth Republic in 1958.

He is best known as the co-founder and former rhythm guitarist of the hard rock band Guns N' Roses, which he left at the height of their fame in 1991, and with whom he recorded four studio albums. Following his departure from Guns N' Roses, Stradlin fronted his own rock band Izzy Stradlin and the Ju Ju Hounds, before continuing to record as a solo artist. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Guns N' Roses in 2012.  Life and career  = Early life = Stradlin was born as Jeffrey Dean Isbell in Lafayette, Indiana. His father was an engraver, and his mother worked for a phone company; they divorced when he was eight. Of his hometown, Stradlin later said, \\"It was cool growing up there. There's a courthouse and a college, a river and railroad tracks. It's a small town, so there wasn't much to do. We rode bikes, smoked pot, got into trouble‚Äîit was pretty Beavis and Butt-Head actually.\\" Stradlin developed an interest in music early in life; by the age of eight, his musical favorites included Bob Dylan, Pink Floyd, Alice Cooper, and Led Zeppelin. His biggest musical influence was his paternal grandmother, who played drums in a swing jazz band with her friends. Inspired, Stradlin talked his parents into buying him a drum kit. In high school, Stradlin started a band with his friends, one of whom was singer William Bailey, later known as Axl Rose. Stradlin recalled, \\"We were long-haired guys in high school. You were either a jock or a stoner. We weren't jocks, so we ended up hanging out together. We'd play covers in the garage. There were no clubs to play at, so we never made it out of the garage.\\" Despite his aversion to school, Stradlin graduated in 1980 with a D average, the only original member of Guns N' Roses with a high school diploma. Set on a career in music, he subsequently moved to Los Angeles, California. = 1980‚Äì1984: Career beginnings = Shortly after his arrival in Los Angeles, Stradlin joined punk band Naughty Women. During his ill-fated first show with the band, audience members began attacking the musicians; Stradlin recalled, \\"I just grabbed a cymbal stand and stood on the side trying to fend them off, yelling, 'Get the fuck away from me, man!' That was my introduction to the rock scene in L.A.\\" His two-month tenure in Naughty Women was followed by a stint in punk band The Atoms, before his drum kit was stolen from his car and he switched to bass. Stradlin then joined the heavy metal band Shire, during which he took up rhythm guitar to aid his songwriting. In 1983, Stradlin formed Hollywood Rose with his childhood friend Axl Rose, who had moved to Los Angeles the previous year. In January 1984, the band recorded a five-song demo featuring the tracks \\"Killing Time\\", \\"Anything Goes\\", \\"Rocker\\", \\"Shadow of Your Love\\", and \\"Reckless Life\\", which were released in 2004 as part of the compilation album The Roots of Guns N' Roses. The group disbanded in August, following which Stradlin briefly joined Sunset Strip staple London. He also formed the short-lived band Stalin with singer Eric Leach and guitarist Taz Rudd of Symbol Six. In December, he reunited with Hollywood Rose. = 1985‚Äì1991: Guns N' Roses = In March 1985, Stradlin founded Guns N' Roses with Axl Rose and members of L.A. Guns, Tracii Guns, Ole Beich and Rob Gardner, as a favor to L.A. Guns manager, Raz Cue, who had previously booked the act at the Troubadour. By June, the line-up consisted of Rose, guitarist Slash, rhythm guitarist Stradlin, bassist Duff McKagan, and drummer Steven Adler. They played nightclubs‚Äîsuch as the Whisky a Go Go, The Roxy, and The Troubadour‚Äîand opened for larger acts throughout 1985 and 1986. During this period, the band wrote much of its classic material, and Stradlin established himself as a key songwriter. In July 1987, Guns N' Roses released their debut album, Appetite for Destruction, which to date has sold over 28 million copies worldwide, including 18 million in the United States alone. Stradlin wrote or cowrote most of its songs, including the hits \\"Sweet Child o' Mine\\" and \\"Paradise City\\". He also wrote the hit \\"Patience\\" on the follow-up G N' R Lies, released in November 1988 to US sales of five million copies, despite containing only eight tracks, four of which were included on the previously released EP Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide. As their success grew, so did tensions within the band. In 1989, opening for The Rolling Stones, Rose threatened to leave the band if Stradlin, Slash, and Adler didn't stop \\"dancing with Mr. Brownstone,\\" a reference to their song of the same name about heroin. After being sentenced to a year's probation for urinating in public aboard an airplane (after which the band nicknamed him \\"Whizzy\\"), Stradlin decided to attain sobriety; he returned to his mother's home in Indiana, where he detoxed from drugs and alcohol. The following year, Adler was fired from the band because of his heroin addiction; he was replaced by Matt Sorum of The Cult. In September 1991, Guns N' Roses released the long-awaited Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II, which debuted at No. 2 and No. 1 respectively in the US chart ‚Äì an unprecedented feat. Stradlin cowrote the hits \\"Don't Cry\\" and \\"You Could Be Mine\\", and performed lead vocals on \\"Dust N' Bones\\", \\"You Ain't the First\\", \\"Double Talkin' Jive\\", and \\"14 Years\\". As with their previous records, his preferred guitar during recording was a Gibson ES-175. By the release of the Use Your Illusion albums, Stradlin had become dissatisfied with life in Guns N' Roses: \\"Once I quit drugs, I couldn't help looking around and asking myself, 'Is this all there is?' I was just tired of it; I needed to get out.\\" On November 7, 1991, it was announced that he had left Guns N' Roses, having played his final show as an official member on August 31 at Wembley Stadium. Stradlin later said, \\"I didn't like the complications that became such a part of daily life in Guns N' Roses,\\" citing the Riverport riot and Axl Rose's chronic lateness and diva behavior on the Use Your Illusion Tour as examples. He also objected to a contract with which he was presented: \\"This is right before I left ‚Äì demoting me to some lower position. They were gonna cut my percentage of royalties down. I was like, 'Fuck you! I've been there from Day One. Why should I do that? Fuck you, I'll go play the Whisky.' That's what happened. It was utterly insane.\\" Stradlin added that getting sober played a part in his decision to leave, saying, \\"When you're fucked up, you're more likely to put up with things you wouldn't normally put up with.\\" = 1992‚Äì1994: Ju Ju Hounds and first return to Guns N' Roses = Following his departure from Guns N' Roses, Stradlin returned to his hometown of Lafayette, Indiana, where he began working on new material. He formed the band Izzy Stradlin and the Ju Ju Hounds, which consisted of Stradlin on vocals and rhythm guitar, Rick Richards of Georgia Satellites on lead guitar, Jimmy Ashhurst of Broken Homes on bass, and Charlie Quintana on drums. Their self- titled debut album was released in October 1992 to positive reviews; Rolling Stone called it \\"a ragged, blues-drenched, and thoroughly winning solo debut.\\" Ju Ju Hounds played its first show in September at The Avalon in Chicago, before embarking on a tour of Europe, Australia, and North America. In May 1993, Stradlin reunited with Guns N' Roses for five shows in Europe and the Middle East to fill in for his replacement, Gilby Clarke, who had broken his wrist in a motorcycle accident. After Stradlin returned to the Ju Ju Hounds, Axl Rose dedicated the Stradlin-penned \\"Double Talkin' Jive\\" to him during several shows. In September, the Ju Ju Hounds undertook a tour of Japan, where the band played its final show at the Shibuya Public Hall in Tokyo. Stradlin then took time off from music, during which he traveled extensively and dedicated much of his time to his other passion‚Äîmotor racing, even building a track close to his Indiana home. = 1995‚Äì2002: Solo career and Velvet Revolver = Stradlin during a concert in 2006 In 1995, Stradlin began recording material for his second solo album, 117¬∞. Released in March 1998, the album was recorded in fits and starts over a period of two years and featured his former bandmates Duff McKagan and Rick Richards, as well as former Reverend Horton Heat drummer Taz Bentley, whose work Stradlin admired. As before, Stradlin had little interest in promoting his music; he did few interviews and played no live performances. The album turned out to be his last release on his long-time label Geffen; as a result of the merge between Geffen and Interscope, Stradlin was dropped from the label's roster. In December 1999, Stradlin's third solo album, Ride On, was released on the Universal Victor label in Japan. It featured the same line-up as his previous release. To promote the album, Stradlin‚Äîwith McKagan, Richards, and Bentley‚Äîplayed four shows in Japan the following April. With the addition of keyboardist Ian McLagan, the group recorded two more albums: River, which was released in May 2001 on Sanctuary, and a second Japan-only release, On Down the Road, which followed in August 2002 on JVC Victor. Stradlin was then asked by his former Guns N' Roses bandmates Duff McKagan, Slash, and Matt Sorum to join the supergroup Velvet Revolver. Although he contributed to the songwriting process while the band was in its formative stage, Stradlin ultimately declined to join due to his aversion to life on the road and his unwillingness to work with a lead singer, although he offered to share vocal duties with McKagan. = 2003‚Äì2010: Independent solo career and second return to Guns N' Roses = In 2003, Stradlin recorded his sixth album, Like a Dog, with guitarist Rick Richards, drummer Taz Bentley, and bassist JT Longoria. It was originally scheduled for a late 2003 release, with just under one thousand promo copies made. However, the album was not released until October 2005, when Stradlin‚Äîprompted by a fan petition‚Äîmade it available through internet order. The following year, Stradlin re-released Ride On, River, On Down the Road, and Like a Dog through iTunes. Stradlin and Axl Rose at the Download Festival in 2006 In May 2006, thirteen years after his last performance with Guns N' Roses, Stradlin made a guest appearance at the band's show at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York; he played on \\"Patience\\", \\"Think About You\\", and \\"Nightrain\\". He then performed with Guns N' Roses for 13 shows during the band's summer European tour. Stradlin said, \\"Axl [Rose] and I connected via cell phone this year, I stopped by. It was nice to reconnect with an old friend/war buddy/fellow musician. I told him later I'd like to join the fun in some way and he said I was welcome to come and play something, so I did! Took me about three weeks to recover from the six weeks of touring!\\" In December, he played three shows with the group at the Gibson Amphitheatre in Universal City, California. Stradlin released his seventh album, Miami, through iTunes in May 2007. It again featured Rick Richards, Taz Bentley, and JT Longoria, as well as keyboardist Joey Huffman. Guitarist Richards described the album as being \\"a bit of a departure from Like a Dog but still quite a rocker.\\" In July, a remixed version of Miami was released through iTunes; Stradlin called the new mix \\"much louder and more powerful sounding.\\" In November of that year, he released a second iTunes-only album, Fire, the Acoustic Album, which also featured Richards, Bentley, and Longoria. Stradlin's next iTunes release, Concrete, came out in July 2008. In addition to his regular collaborators, Stradlin also invited Duff McKagan to play bass on three songs, including the title track. Stradlin then released two more albums through iTunes: Smoke, which came out in December 2009, and Wave of Heat, which followed in July 2010 and again featured McKagan, who appears on seven tracks. Also in 2010, Stradlin appeared as a guest on Slash's first solo album, Slash; he performs rhythm guitar on the first track, \\"Ghost\\". = 2011‚Äìpresent: Hall of Fame induction and third return to Guns N' Roses = In April 2012, Stradlin was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the classic lineup of Guns N' Roses. In a statement released through Duff McKagan's blog for Seattle Weekly, he thanked the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame \\"for the acknowledgement of our works over the years,\\" his former bandmates, and his fans for their continuing support. Known to avoid public attention, Stradlin did not attend the induction ceremony. In the month following the induction, Stradlin joined Guns N' Roses on stage during two shows at London's O2 Arena, where they performed a range of songs including \\"14 Years,\\" which had not been performed live since his departure in 1991. He also performed with Guns N' Roses in July, at a private show in Saint-Tropez and a concert in Palma de Mallorca, and again in November, during the last two shows of the band's twelve-date \\"Appetite for Democracy\\" residency in Las Vegas. Also in November, Stradlin released the iTunes-only single \\"Baby-Rann\\"‚Äîhis first release in over two years; an accompanying video was made available via YouTube. Amidst rumors and speculation, Stradlin joined Twitter, and confirmed in a statement to Rolling Stone that he will not be involved with the 'reunited' Guns N' Roses lineup in 2016. He later stated that he declined because the band \\"didn't want to split the loot equally\\". In 2018, Alan Niven reported that Stradlin participated in a soundcheck with Guns N' Roses sometime in 2017, but ultimately left before guesting on the show. Stradlin also reportedly declined special guest appearances similar to the ones Adler had. Stradlin released numerous singles in 2016, previewing samples of the songs via his Twitter account and through the YouTube channel 'classicrockstuffs'. \\"Sunshine\\" by Jonathon Edwards and \\"Stuck in the Middle with You\\" by Stealers Wheel were acoustic videos made available through YouTube, whilst \\"Walk N' Song\\", \\"F.P. Money\\" (featuring former Guns N' Roses drummer Matt Sorum), \\"To Being Alive\\" and a cover version of the J.J. Cale song \\"Call Me the Breeze \\"featuring Jesse Aycock and Lauren Barth, were released to online music stores. In 2017, Stradlin played guitar on the song \\"Grandview\\" by John Mellencamp, on his album Sad Clowns & Hillbillies. Martina McBride was also featured on the song.

Tamm, also of the Soviet Union. He received the award for his work in explaining the phenomenon of Cherenkov radiation. He received the Stalin prize in 1946 and 1953 and the USSR state prize in 1971. Life and career Ilya Frank was born on 23 October 1908 in St. Petersburg. His father, Mikhail Lyudvigovich Frank, was a talented mathematician descended from a Jewish family, while his mother Yelizaveta Mikhailovna Gratsianova, was a Russian Orthodox physician. His father participated in the student revolutionary movement, and as a result was expelled from Moscow University. After the October Revolution, he was reinstated and appointed professor. Ilya's uncle, Semen Frank, a noted Russian philosopher, wasn't as fortunate and was expelled from the USSR in 1922 together with 160 other intellectuals. Ilya had one elder brother, Gleb Mikhailovich Frank, who became an eminent biophysicist and member of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R.. Ilya Frank studied mathematics and theoretical physics at Moscow State University. From his second year he worked in the laboratory of Sergey Ivanovich Vavilov, whom he regarded as his mentor. After graduating in 1930, on recommendation of Vavilov, he started working at the State Optical Institute in Leningrad. There he wrote his first publication‚Äîabout luminescence‚Äî with Vavilov. The work he did there would form the basis of his doctoral dissertation in 1935. In 1934, Frank moved to the Institute of Physics and Mathematics of the USSR Academy of Sciences (which shortly would be moved to Moscow, where it was transformed into the Institute of Physics). Here he started working on nuclear physics, a new field for him. He became interested in the effect discovered by Pavel Cherenkov, that charged particles moving through water at high speeds emit light. Together with Igor Tamm, he developed a theoretical explanation: the effect occurs when charged particles travel through an optically transparent medium at speeds greater than the speed of light in that medium, causing a shock wave in the electromagnetic field. The amount of energy radiated in this process is given by the Frank‚ÄìTamm formula. The discovery and explanation of the effect resulted in the development of new methods for detecting and measuring the velocity of high-speed nuclear particles and became of great importance for research in nuclear physics. Cherenkov radiation is also widely used in biomedical research for detection of radioactive isotopes. In 1946, Cherenkov, Vavilov, Tamm, and Frank were awarded a Stalin Prize for their discovery, and 1958 Cherenkov, Tamm, and Frank received the Nobel Prize in physics. In 1944, Frank was appointed professor and became head of a department at the Institute of Physics and of the Nuclear Physics Laboratory (which was later transferred to the Institute of Nuclear Research). Frank's laboratory was involved in the (then secret) study of nuclear reactors. In particular, they studied the diffusion and thermalization of neutrons. In 1957, Frank also become director of the Laboratory of Neutron Physics at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. The laboratory was based on the neutron fast-pulse reactor (IBR) then under construction at the site. Under Frank's supervision the reactor was used in the development of neutron spectroscopy techniques. Personal life Frank married the noted historian, Ella Abramovna Beilikhis, in 1937. Their son, Alexander, was born in the same year, and would continue much of the studies of his father as a physicist.

In economics, the words cargo and freight refer in particular to goods or produce being conveyed‚Äîgenerally for commercial gain‚Äîby water, air or land. Cargo was originally a shipload. Cargo now covers all types of freight, including that carried by rail, van, truck, or intermodal container. The term cargo is also used in case of goods in the cold-chain, because the perishable inventory is always in transit towards a final end-use, even when it is held in cold storage or other similar climate-controlled facility. The term freight is commonly used to describe the movements of flows of goods being transported by any mode of transportation. Multi-modal container units, designed as reusable carriers to facilitate unit load handling of the goods contained, are also referred to as cargo, specially by shipping lines and logistics operators. Similarly, aircraft ULD boxes are also documented as cargo, with associated packing list of the items contained within. When empty containers are shipped each unit is documented as a cargo and when goods are stored within, the contents are termed as containerised cargo.  Description  Transportation types: Cargo can travel via many different modalities: =Marine= Container ship at the Port of Helsinki in Finland Seaport terminals handle a wide range of maritime cargo. # Break bulk cargo is typically material stacked on pallets and lifted into and out of the hold of a vessel by cranes on the dock or aboard the ship itself. The volume of break bulk cargo has declined dramatically worldwide as containerization has grown. One way to secure break bulk and freight in intermodal containers is by using Dunnage Bags. # Bulk cargo, such as salt, oil, tallow, and scrap metal, is usually defined as commodities that are neither on pallets nor in containers. Bulk cargoes are not handled as individual pieces, the way heavy-lift and project cargoes are. Alumina, grain, gypsum, logs, and wood chips, for instance, are bulk cargoes. Bulk cargo is classified as liquid or dry. # Container Cargo: Containers are the largest and fastest growing cargo category at most ports worldwide. Containerized cargo includes everything from auto parts, machinery and manufacturing components to shoes and toys to frozen meat and seafood. # Neo- bulk cargo comprises individual units that are counted as they are loaded and unloaded, in contrast to bulk cargo that is not counted, but that are not containerized. # Project cargo and the heavy lift cargo include items like manufacturing equipment, air conditioners, factory components, generators, wind turbines, military equipment, and almost any other oversized or overweight cargo which is too big or too heavy to fit into a container. # Roll-on/roll-off Cargo: Automobiles are handled at many ports and are usually carried on specialized roll-on/roll-off ships. # Please also see: List of cargo types =Air= Cargolux Boeing 747-400F with the nose loading door open Air cargo, commonly known as air freight, is collected by firms from shippers and delivered to customers. Aircraft were first used for carrying mail as cargo in 1911. Eventually manufacturers started designing aircraft for other types of freight as well. There are many commercial aircraft suitable for carrying cargo such as the Boeing 747 and the bigger An‚Äë124, which was purposely built for easy conversion into a cargo aircraft. Such large aircraft employ quick-loading containers known as unit load devices (ULDs), much like containerized cargo ships. The ULDs are located in the front section of the aircraft. Most nations own and utilize large numbers of military cargo aircraft such as the C‚Äë17 Globemaster III for logistical needs. Popular commercial aircraft transformed to a cargo aircraft such as Saab 340A is designed for high revenue and profitability in short / medium haul operations. =Rail= P&O; Nedlloyd inter-modal freight well car at Banbury station. England, (2001) double-stack well car owned by the TTX Company. The capacity car is a Gunderson Maxi-IV. Trains are capable of transporting a large number of containers that come from shipping ports. Trains are also used for the transportation of water, cement, grain, steel, wood and coal. They are used because they can carry a large amount and generally have a direct route to the destination. Under the right circumstances, freight transport by rail is more economic and energy efficient than by road, especially when carried in bulk or over long distances. The main disadvantage of rail freight is its lack of flexibility. For this reason, rail has lost much of the freight business to road transport. Rail freight is often subject to transshipment costs, since it must be transferred from one mode of transportation to another. Practices such as containerization aim at minimizing these costs. When transporting point-to- point bulk loads such as cement or grain, with specialised bulk handling facilities at the rail sidings, rail mode of transport remains the most convenient and preferred option. Many governments are currently trying to encourage shippers to use trains more often because of the environmental benefits. =Road= Many firms, like Parcelforce, FedEx and R+L Carriers transport all types of cargo by road. Delivering everything from letters to houses to cargo containers, these firms offer fast, sometimes same-day, delivery. A good example of road cargo is food, as supermarkets require deliveries daily to replenish their shelves with goods. Retailers and manufacturers of all kinds rely upon delivery trucks, be they full size semi trucks or smaller delivery vans. These smaller road haulage companies constantly strive for the best routes and prices to ship out their products. Indeed, the level of commercial freight transported by smaller businesses is often a good barometer of healthy economic development as it is these types of vehicles that move and transport literally anything, including couriers transporting parcel and mail. You can see the different types and weights of vehicles that are used to move cargo around . =Less-than-truckload freight= Less than truckload (LTL) cargo is the first category of freight shipment, which represents the majority of freight shipments and the majority of business-to-business (B2B) shipments. LTL shipments are also often referred to as motor freight and the carriers involved are referred to as motor carriers. LTL shipments range from , being less than the majority of times. The average single piece of LTL freight is and the size of a standard pallet. Long freight and/or large freight are subject to extreme length and cubic capacity surcharges. Trailers used in LTL can range from . The standard for city deliveries is usually . In tight and residential environments the trailer is used the most. The shipments are usually palletized, stretch [shrink]-wrapped and packaged for a mixed-freight environment. Unlike express or parcel, LTL shippers must provide their own packaging, as carriers do not provide any packaging supplies or assistance. However, circumstances may require crating or other substantial packaging. Boeing 777 freighter of Emirates arrives at London Heathrow Airport (2015). =Air freight= Air freight shipments are very similar to LTL shipments in terms of size and packaging requirements. However, air freight or air cargo shipments typically need to move at much faster speeds than per hour. Air shipments may be booked directly with the carriers, through brokers or with online marketplace services. While shipments move faster than standard LTL, air shipments don't always actually move by air. In the US, there are certain restrictions on shipments moving via air freight on passenger aircraft. Shippers in the US must be approved and be \\"known\\" in the Known Shipper Management System before their shipments can be tendered on passenger aircraft. =Truckload freight= In the United States, shipments larger than about are typically classified as truckload (TL) freight. This is because it is more efficient and economical for a large shipment to have exclusive use of one larger trailer rather than share space on a smaller LTL trailer. By the Federal Bridge Gross Weight Formula the total weight of a loaded truck (tractor and trailer, 5-axle rig) cannot exceed 80000 lbs in the United States. In ordinary circumstances, long- haul equipment will weigh about , leaving about of freight capacity. Similarly a load is limited to the space available in the trailer, normally or long, wide, high and high over all. While express, parcel and LTL shipments are always intermingled with other shipments on a single piece of equipment and are typically reloaded across multiple pieces of equipment during their transport, TL shipments usually travel as the only shipment on a trailer. In fact, TL shipments usually deliver on exactly the same trailer as they are picked up on. = Shipment categories = * the type of item being carried. For example, a kettle could fit into the category 'household goods'. * how large the shipment is, in terms of both item size and quantity. * how long the item for delivery will be in transit. * Household goods (HHG) include furniture, art and similar items. * Express: Very small business or personal items like envelopes are considered overnight express or express letter shipments. These shipments are rarely over a few kilograms or pounds and almost always travel in the carrier's own packaging. Express shipments almost always travel some distance by air. An envelope may go coast to coast in the United States overnight or it may take several days, depending on the service options and prices chosen by the shipper. * Parcel: Larger items like small boxes are considered parcels or ground shipments. These shipments are rarely over , with no single piece of the shipment weighing more than about . Parcel shipments are always boxed, sometimes in the shipper's packaging and sometimes in carrier-provided packaging. Service levels are again variable but most ground shipments will move about per day. Depending on the origin of the package, it can travel from coast to coast in the United States in about four days. Parcel shipments rarely travel by air and typically move via road and rail. Parcels represent the majority of business-to-consumer (B2C) shipments. * Freight: Beyond HHG, express, and parcel shipments, movements are termed freight shipments. Shipping costs Often, an LTL shipper may realize savings by utilizing a freight broker, online marketplace or other intermediary, instead of contracting directly with a trucking company. Brokers can shop the marketplace and obtain lower rates than most smaller shippers can obtain directly. In the LTL marketplace, intermediaries typically receive 50% to 80% discounts from published rates, where a small shipper may only be offered a 5% to 30% discount by the carrier. Intermediaries are licensed by the DOT and have requirements to provide proof of insurance. Truckload (TL) carriers usually charge a rate per kilometre or mile. The rate varies depending on the distance, geographic location of the delivery, items being shipped, equipment type required, and service times required. TL shipments usually receive a variety of surcharges very similar to those described for LTL shipments above. In the TL market, there are thousands more small carriers than in the LTL market. Therefore, the use of transportation intermediaries or brokers is extremely common. Another cost-saving method is facilitating pickups or deliveries at the carrier's terminals. By doing this, shippers avoid any accessorial fees that might normally be charged for liftgate, residential pickup/delivery, inside pickup/delivery, or notifications/appointments. Carriers or intermediaries can provide shippers with the address and phone number for the closest shipping terminal to the origin and/or destination. Shipping experts optimize their service and costs by sampling rates from several carriers, brokers and online marketplaces. When obtaining rates from different providers, shippers may find a wide range in the pricing offered. If a shipper in the United States uses a broker, freight forwarder or other transportation intermediary, it is common for the shipper to receive a copy of the carrier's Federal Operating Authority.Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration Freight brokers and intermediaries are also required by Federal Law to be licensed by the Federal Highway Administration. Experienced shippers avoid unlicensed brokers and forwarders because if brokers are working outside the law by not having a Federal Operating License, the shipper has no protection in the event of a problem. Also, shippers normally ask for a copy of the broker's insurance certificate and any specific insurance that applies to the shipment. Overall, shipping costs have fallen over the past decades. A further drop in shipping costs in the future might be realized through the application of improved 3D printing technologies. Security concerns Governments are very concerned with the shipment of cargo, as it may bring security risks to a country. Therefore, many governments have enacted rules and regulations, administered by a customs agency, to the handling of cargo to minimize risks of terrorism and other crime. Governments are particularly concerned with cargo entering through a country's borders. The United States has been one of the leaders in securing cargo. They see cargo as a concern to national security. After the terrorist attacks of September 11th, the security of this magnitude of cargo has become highlighted on the over 6 million cargo containers enter the United States ports each year.Murray Unveils First-in-the-Nation Port Security Demonstration The latest US Government response to this threat is the CSI: Container Security Initiative. CSI is a program intended to help increase security for containerised cargo shipped to the United States from around the world.CSI: Container Security Initiative Europe is also focusing on this issue, with a number of EU-funded projects underway. Stabilization There are many different ways and materials available to stabilize and secure cargo in various modes of transport. Conventional load securing methods and materials such as steel strapping and plastic/wood blocking & bracing have been used for decades and are still widely used. Present load securing methods offer several other options including polyester strapping and lashing, synthetic webbings and dunnage bags, also known as air bags or inflatable bags. Practical advise on stabilization is given in the International Guidelines on Safe Load Securing for Road Transport.International Guidelines on Safe Load Securing for Road Transport Image:Stabilizing_capabilities_Cordstrap_dunnage_bags.jpgApplication in container Image:Lashing_and_dunnage_bag_application.JPGPolyester strapping and dunnage bag Image:Lashing_application_flat_rack.jpgPolyester lashing Image:Amphorae stacking.jpgBronze Age amphorae from shipwrecks near Bodrum, Turkey, with rack and roping device illustrating how they might have been kept from shifting  See also  * Cargo airline * Cargo sampling * Cargo scanning * Counter-to-counter package * Delivery * DAT Solutions (a.k.a.

This aspect of their physiology is known as pedomorphosis. Despite having lungs, which appear to provide little use in respiration, mudpuppies spend their entire lives underwater. The adult gills resemble fish gills in many ways, but differ from fish gills in that they are external and lack any form of operculum, or covering. The bright red exposed gills are often found closed against the body in cool, highly oxygenated water. In warmer, poorly oxygenated water, the gills expand to increase water circulation and provide greater surface area for oxygen intake. Necturus salamanders such as \\"mudpuppies\\" also absorb oxygen through their skin and by occasionally breathing air at the surface. Other distinguishing features of proteid salamanders, as compared with other salamanders, are the absence of eyelids and a lack of maxillary bones in the upper jaw. They show a degree of parental care, tending to the eggs after attaching them to submerged stones and logs. Proteid salamanders range in size from to in length. Members of the genus Necturus, commonly called \\"mudpuppies\\" or \\"waterdogs\\", prefer shallow lakes and streams that have slow moving water and rocks to hide under, but have been found in up to 90 feet of water. Their name originates from the misconception that they make a dog-like barking sound. Diet consists of small fish and many invertebrates, including crayfish, snails, and worms. Mudpuppies mature at four to six years and can live to be more than twenty years old. Progenesis is common for mudpuppies, enabling them to reach sexual maturity in their larval stage. Even though they eat fish eggs, negative effects on fish populations have not been documented. Fishermen have been known to catch mudpuppies, sometimes in large numbers, but most often when ice fishing. Necturus salamanders also commonly feed on mollusks, worms, insects and small fish.Olms and Mudpuppies: Proteidae - Diet, Animals JRANK http://animals.jrank.org/pages/292/Olms-Mudpuppies-Proteidae-DIET.html To distinguish between a larval mudpuppy and other larval salamanders, note that larval mudpuppies have distinct longitudinal banding and four toes on their hind legs, the combination of which is not found in most larval salamanders within the same range.Petranka, J.W. (1998). Salamanders of the United States and Canada. Smithsonian Institution Press The main difference between a mudpuppy and a siren is that, whereas mudpuppies have both front and hind legs, a siren will only have one pair of very small, atrophied front legs.

Its chief sponsors were senators Russ Feingold (D-WI) and John McCain (R-AZ). The law became effective on 6 November 2002, and the new legal limits became effective on January 1, 2003. As noted in McConnell v. FEC, a United States Supreme Court ruling on the BCRA, the Act was designed to address two issues: * The increased role of soft money in campaign financing, by prohibiting national political party committees from raising or spending any funds not subject to federal limits, even for state and local races or issue discussion; * The proliferation of issue advocacy ads, by defining as \\"electioneering communications\\" broadcast ads that name a federal candidate within 30 days of a primary or caucus or 60 days of a general election, and prohibiting any such ad paid for by a corporation (including non-profit issue organizations such as Right to Life or the Environmental Defense Fund) or paid for by an unincorporated entity using any corporate or union general treasury funds. The decision in Citizens United v. FEC overturns this provision, but not the ban on foreign corporations or foreign nationals in decisions regarding political spending.Electioneering Communications, Federal Election Commission. January 2010. Although the legislation is known as \\"McCain‚ÄìFeingold\\", the Senate version is not the bill that became law. Instead, the companion legislation, H.R. 2356‚Äîintroduced by Rep. Chris Shays (R-CT), is the version that became law. Shays‚ÄìMeehan was originally introduced as H.R. 380.  History of the bill  In the aftermath of Watergate, Congress passed the Federal Election Campaign Act Amendments of 1974, which put new limits on contributions to campaigns. Four years later, the FEC ruled that donors could donate unlimited money to political parties (but not the candidates themselves) if the party used that money for \\"party building activities\\" such as voter registration drives, but not to directly support candidates. Both the Republican and Democratic parties nonetheless used this money to support their candidates, and money donated to parties became known as soft money. In 1992, President George H. W. Bush vetoed a bill passed by the Democratic Congress that would have, among other things, restricted the use of soft money. President Clinton pushed for a similar bill, but was unable to get both houses to agree on one bill. In 1995, senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Russ Feingold (D-WI) jointly published an op-ed calling for campaign finance reform, and began working on their own bill. In 1998, the Senate voted on the bill, but the bill failed to meet the 60 vote threshold to defeat a filibuster. All 45 Senate Democrats and 6 Senate Republicans voted to invoke cloture, but the remaining 49 Republicans voted against invoking cloture. This effectively killed the bill for the remainder of the 105th Congress. McCain's 2000 campaign for president and a series of scandals (including the Enron scandal) brought the issue of campaign finance to the fore of public consciousness in 2001. McCain and Feingold pushed the bill in the Senate, while Chris Shays (R-CT) and Marty Meehan (D-MA) led the effort to pass the bill in the House. In just the second successful use of the discharge petition since the 1980s, a mixture of Democrats and Republicans defied Speaker Dennis Hastert and passed a campaign finance reform bill. The House approved the bill with a 240‚Äì189 vote, sending the bill to the Senate. The bill passed the Senate in a 60‚Äì40 vote, the bare minimum required to overcome the filibuster. Throughout the congressional battle on the bill, President Bush declined to take a strong position, but Bush signed the law in March 2002 after it cleared both houses of Congress.  Legal disputes  Provisions of the legislation were challenged as unconstitutional by a group of plaintiffs led by then‚ÄìSenate majority whip Mitch McConnell, a long-time opponent of the bill. President Bush signed the law despite \\"reservations about the constitutionality of the broad ban on issue advertising.\\" He appeared to expect that the Supreme Court would overturn some of its key provisions. But, in December 2003, the Supreme Court upheld most of the legislation in McConnell v. FEC. Subsequently, political parties and \\"watchdog\\" organizations have filed complaints with the FEC concerning the raising and spending of soft money by so-called \\"527 organizations\\"‚Äîorganizations claiming tax-exemption as \\"political organizations\\" under Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code (), but not registering as \\"political committees\\" under the Federal Election Campaign Act, which uses a different legal definition.What is a 527 organization? Federal Election Commission. These organizations have been established on both sides of the political aisle, and have included high-profile organizations such as the Media Fund and the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. 527s are financed in large part by wealthy individuals, labor unions, and businesses. 527s pre- dated McCain‚ÄìFeingold but grew in popularity after the law took effect. In May 2004, the FEC voted to not write new rules on the application of federal campaign finance laws to 527 organizations. Although the FEC did promulgate a new rule in the fall of 2004 requiring some 527s participating in federal campaigns to use at least 50% \\"hard money\\" (contributions regulated by the Federal Election Campaign Act) to pay their expenses, the FEC did not change its regulations on when a 527 organization must register as a federal \\"political committee\\"-prompting Representatives Shays and Meehan to file a federal court lawsuit against the FEC for the Commission's failure to adopt a 527 rule. In September, 2007, a Federal District Court ruled in favor of the FEC, against congressmen Shays and Meehan. In December 2006 the FEC entered settlements with three 527 groups the commission found to have violated federal law by failing to register as \\"political committees\\" and abide by contribution limits, source prohibitions and disclosure requirements during the 2004 election cycle. Swift Boat Veterans for Truth was fined $299,500; the League of Conservation Voters was fined $180,000; MoveOn.org was fined $150,000. In February 2007, the 527 organization Progress for America Voter Fund was likewise fined $750,000 for its failure to abide by federal campaign finance laws during the 2004 election cycle. In June 2007 the U.S. Supreme Court held, in FEC v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc., that BCRA's limitations on corporate and labor union funding of broadcast ads mentioning a candidate within 30 days of a primary or caucus or 60 days of a general election are unconstitutional as applied to ads susceptible of a reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate. Some election law experts believed that the new exception would render BCRA's \\"electioneering communication\\" provisions meaningless, while others believed the new exception to be quite narrow. In June 2008, the section of the act known as the \\"millionaire's amendment\\" was overturned by the Supreme Court in Davis v. Federal Election Commission. This provision had attempted to \\"equalize\\" campaigns by providing that the legal limit on contributions would increase for a candidate who was substantially outspent by an opposing candidate using personal wealth. In 2008 one of the cosponsors of the legislation, Senator John McCain of Arizona, touted this piece of legislation and others that he sponsored in his bid for the presidency.Senator McCain's Voting Record, On the Issues. Senator McCain consistently voiced concern over campaign practices and their funding. \\"'Questions of honor are raised as much by appearances as by reality in politics, and because they incite public distrust, they need to be addressed no less directly than we would address evidence of expressly illegal corruption,' McCain wrote in his 2002 memoir Worth the Fighting For. 'By the time I became a leading advocate of campaign finance reform, I had come to appreciate that the public's suspicions were not always mistaken. Money does buy access in Washington, and access increases influence that often results in benefiting the few at the expense of the many.'\\" In March 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, regarding whether or not a political documentary about Hillary Clinton could be considered a political ad that must be paid for with funds regulated under the Federal Election Campaign Act. In January 2010, the Supreme Court struck sections of McCain‚ÄìFeingold down which limited activity of corporations, saying, \\"If the First Amendment has any force, it prohibits Congress from fining or jailing citizens, or associations of citizens, for simply engaging in political speech.\\" Specifically, Citizens United struck down campaign financing laws related to corporations and unions; law previously banned the broadcast, cable or satellite transmission of \\"electioneering communications\\" paid for by corporations in the 30 days before a presidential primary and in the 60 days before the general election. The ruling did not, as commonly thought, change the amount of money corporations and unions can contribute to campaigns. The minority argued that the court erred in allowing unlimited corporate spending, arguing that corporate spending posed a particular threat to democratic self-government. President Barack Obama expressed his concern over the Supreme Court's decision during his 2010 State of the Union Address, delivered January 27, saying, \\"With all due deference to separation of powers, last week the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interests‚Äîincluding foreign corporations‚Äîto spend without limit in our elections. I don't think American elections should be bankrolled by America's most powerful interests, or worse, by foreign entities. They should be decided by the American people. And I'd urge Democrats and Republicans to pass a bill that helps to correct some of these problems.\\"The White House Press Room, Remarks by the President in State of the Union Address , January 27, 2010. President Obama also called the decision, \\"a major victory for big oil, Wall Street banks, health insurance companies and the other powerful interests that marshal their power every day in Washington to drown out the voices of everyday Americans.\\"  Impact  The BCRA decreased the role of soft money in political campaigns as the law places limits on the contributions by interest groups and national political parties. The BCRA had a \\"Stand by Your Ad\\" Provision, which requires candidates in the United States for federal political office, as well as interest groups and political parties supporting or opposing a candidate, to include in political advertisements on television and radio \\"a statement by the candidate that identifies the candidate and states that the candidate has approved the communication.\\" The impact of BCRA first started being felt nationally with the 2004 elections. One immediately recognizable result was that, as a result of the so-called stand by your ad provision, all campaign advertisements included a verbal statement to the effect of \\"I'm [candidate's name] and I approve this message.\\"  References   External links  * McConnell v.

During World War II, he worked on the German nuclear energy project, known as the Uranium Club, where he contributed to the separation of uranium isotopes. After the war, Jensen was a professor at the University of Heidelberg. He was a visiting professor at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, the Institute for Advanced Study, University of California, Berkeley, Indiana University, and the California Institute of Technology.Johannes Jensen ‚Äì Nobel Prize Biography (1963) Jensen shared half of the 1963 Nobel Prize in Physics with Maria Goeppert-Mayer for their proposal of the nuclear shell model. Education Jensen studied physics, mathematics, physical chemistry and philosophy at the Albert-Ludwigs- Universit√§t Freiburg and University of Hamburg from 1926 to 1931, and received his doctorate at the latter in 1932 under Wilhelm Lenz. He completed his habilitation in 1936 at the University of Hamburg.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, 363-364 and Appendix F; see the entry for Johannes Jensen Career In 1937 Jensen was Privatdozent (unpaid lecturer) at the University of Hamburg and began working with Paul Harteck, director of the university's physical chemistry department and advisor to the Heereswaffenamt (HWA, Army Ordnance Office) on explosives. Harteck and his teaching assistant Wilhelm Groth made contact with the Reichskriegsministerium (RKM, Reich Ministry of War) on 24 April 1939 to tell them of potential military applications of nuclear chain reactions. Military control of the German nuclear energy project, also known as the Uranverein (Uranium Club), began on 1 September 1939, the day that Nazi Germany initiated World War II by invading Poland. Harteck, one of the principals in the Uranverein, brought Jensen into the project. Jensen's main thrust was on double centrifuges for separation of uranium isotopes (see the section below citing internal reports of the Uranverein). Harteck and Jensen developed a double centrifuge based on a rocking process (Schaukelverfahren) to facilitate the separation effect.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, 363-364 and Appendix F; see the entries for Harteck and Johannes Jensen.Walker, 1993, pp. 121-122 In 1941 Jensen was named extraordinarius professor of theoretical physics at the Technische Hochschule Hannover (today, the Leibniz University Hannover), and in 1946 became an ordinarius professor there. In 1949 he was appointed ordinarius professor at the Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg; and, from 1969 on, was emeritus praecox. He was a guest professor at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison (1951), the Institute for Advanced Study (1952), University of California, Berkeley (1952), Indiana University (1953), California Institute of Technology (1953), University of Minnesota, Twin Cities (1956), and University of California, San Diego (1961). In 1963 Jensen shared half of the Nobel Prize in Physics with Maria Goeppert-Mayer for their proposal of the nuclear shell model; the other half of the prize was awarded to Eugene Wigner for unrelated work in nuclear and particle physics. Party memberships Adolf Hitler took power on 30 January 1933. On 7 April of that year the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service was enacted; this law, and its subsequent related ordinances, politicized the education system in Germany. Other factors enforcing the politicization of education were Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP, National Socialist German Workers Party) organizations in academia and the rise of the Deutsche Physik movement, which was anti-Semitic and had a bias against theoretical physics, especially including quantum mechanics. The Party organizations were the Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund (NSDStB, National Socialist German Student League) founded in 1926, the Nationalsozialistischer Lehrerbund (NSLB, National Socialist Teachers League) founded in 1927, and the Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Dozentenbund (NSDDB, National Socialist German University Lecturers League) founded in 1933. While membership in the NSDDB was not mandatory, it was tactically advantageous, if not unavoidable, as the district leaders had a decisive role in the acceptance of an Habilitationsschrift, which was a prerequisite to attaining the rank of Privatdozent necessary to becoming a university lecturer.Walker, 1993, pp. 192-204. In these pages, Mark Walker puts into perspective the motivations of and the pressures on students and scientists in the early years of National Socialism in Germany. He addresses the general situation, the Uranverein scientists as a group, and particular cases, e.g., Johannes Jensen, Wilhelm Groth, Karl Wirtz, and Wolfgang Gentner.Hentschel, 1996, Appendix C; see entries for NSDDB, NSDStB, and the NSLB.Hoffmann, Dieter Between Autonomy and Accommodation: The German Physical Society during the Third Reich, Physics in Perspective 7(3) pp. 293-329 (2005)Beyerchen, 1977, pp. 123‚Äì167 While all German universities were politicized, not all were as strict in carrying out this end as was the University of Hamburg, where Jensen received his doctorate and Habilitationsschrift. Upon his 1936 habilitation he had been a member of NSDDB for three years, the NSLB for two years, and a candidate for membership in NSDAP, which he received the next year.

Heisenberg wrote the document and convinced the authorities that Jensen had joined the Party organizations only to avoid unnecessary difficulties in academia.Walker, 1993, pp. 192-204 Honors Honors conferred upon Jensen include: *1947 - Honorary professor at the University of Hamburg *1963 - Nobel Prize in Physics *1964 - Honorary doctorate from the Technische Universit√§t Hannover (today, the Leibniz University Hannover) *1969 - Honorary citizen of Fort Lauderdale, Florida Internal reports The following reports were published in Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte (Research Reports in Nuclear Physics), an internal publication of the German Uranverein. The reports were classified Top Secret, they had very limited distribution, and the authors were not allowed to keep copies. The reports were confiscated under the Allied Operation Alsos and sent to the United States Atomic Energy Commission for evaluation. In 1971 the reports were declassified and returned to Germany.

Townes worked on the theory and application of the maser, for which he obtained the fundamental patent, and other work in quantum electronics associated with both maser and laser devices. He shared the 1964 Nobel Prize in Physics with Nikolay Basov and Alexander Prokhorov. Townes was an adviser to the United States Government, meeting every US President from Harry Truman (1945) to Bill Clinton (1999). He directed the US government Science and Technology Advisory Committee for the Apollo lunar landing program. After becoming a professor of the University of California at Berkeley in 1967, he began an astrophysical program that produced several important discoveries, for example, the black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy. Townes was religious and believed that science and religion are converging to provide a greater understanding of the nature and purpose of the universe. Early life Of ethnic German as well as a great deal of ethnic Scottish, English, Welsh, Huguenot French and Scotch Irish ancestry,Aaserud, Finn (May 20, 1987 Charles Townes interview. American Institute of Physics Townes was born in Greenville, South Carolina, the son of Henry Keith Townes (1876‚Äì1958), an attorney, and Ellen Sumter Townes (n√©e Hard; 1881‚Äì1980). He earned his B.S. in Physics and B.A. in Modern Languages at Furman University, where he graduated in 1935. Townes completed work for the Master of Arts degree in physics at Duke University during 1937, and then began graduate school at the California Institute of Technology, from which he received a Ph.D. degree in 1939. During World War II, he worked on radar bombing systems at Bell Labs. Career and research In 1950, Townes was appointed Professor at Columbia University. He served as Executive Director of the Columbia Radiation Laboratory from 1950 to 1952. He was Chairman of the Physics Department from 1952 to 1955. In 1951, Townes conceived a new way to create intense, precise beams of coherent radiation, for which he invented the acronym maser (for Microwave Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation). When the same principle was applied to higher frequencies, the term laser was used (the word \\"light\\" substituting for the word \\"microwave\\"). During 1953, Townes, James P. Gordon, and Herbert J. Zeiger built the first ammonia maser at Columbia University. This device used stimulated emission in a stream of energized ammonia molecules to produce amplification of microwaves at a frequency of about 24.0 gigahertz. From 1959 to 1961, he was on leave of absence from Columbia University to serve as Vice President and Director of Research of the Institute for Defense Analyses in Washington, D.C., a nonprofit organization, which advised the U.S. government and was operated by eleven universities. Between 1961 and 1967, Townes served as both Provost and Professor of Physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Then, during 1967, he was appointed as a Professor of Physics at the University of California at Berkeley, where he remained for almost 50 years; his status was as professor emeritus by the time of his death during 2015. Between 1966 and 1970, he was chairman of the NASA Science Advisory Committee for the Apollo lunar landing program. For his creation of the maser, Townes along with Nikolay Basov and Alexander Prokhorov received the 1964 Nobel Prize in Physics. Townes also developed the use of masers and lasers for astronomy, was part of a team that first discovered complex molecules in space, and determined the mass of the supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way galaxy. During 2002‚Äì2003, Townes served as a Karl Schwarzschild Lecturer in Germany and the Birla Lecturer and Schroedinger Lecturer in India. Townes is one of the 20 American recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics to sign a letter addressed to President George W. Bush in May 2008, urging him to \\"reverse the damage done to basic science research in the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill\\" by requesting additional emergency funding for the Department of Energy‚Äôs Office of Science, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Astrophysics =Galactic center= The center of the Milky Way had long puzzled astronomers, and thick dust obscures the view of it in visible light. During the mid to late 1970s, Townes together with Eric Wollman, John Lacy, Thomas Geballe and Fred Baas studied Sagittarius A, the H II region at the galactic center, at infrared wavelengths. They observed ionized neon gas swirling around the center at such velocities that the mass at the very center must be approximately equal to that of 3 million suns. Such a large mass in such a small space implied that the central object (the radio source Sagittarius A*) contains a supermassive black hole. Sagittarius A* was one of the first black holes detected; subsequently its mass has been more accurately determined to be 4.3 million solar masses. =Shapes and sizes of stars= Townes' last major technological creation was the Infrared Spatial Interferometer with Walt Fitelson, Ed Wishnow and others. The project combined three mobile infrared detectors aligned by lasers that study the same star. If each telescope is 10 meters from the other, it creates an impression of a 30-meter lens. Observations of Betelgeuse, a red giant in the shoulder of the constellation Orion, found that it is increasing and decreasing in size at the rate of 1% per year, 15% over 15 years. ISI produces extremely high angular and spatial resolution. The technology is also playing an important role in the search for extraterrestrial life in collaborations with Dan Werthimer of Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI). Personal life and legacy Daughters of Townes in Sweden in 1964 Townes married Frances H. Brown, an activist for the homeless, during 1941. They lived in Berkeley, California and had four daughters, Linda Rosenwein, Ellen Anderson, Carla Kessler, and Holly Townes. A religious man and a member of the United Church of Christ, Townes believed that \\"science and religion [are] quite parallel, much more similar than most people think and that in the long run, they must converge\\".Harvard Gazette June 16, 2005 Laser's inventor predicts meeting of science, religion He wrote in a statement after winning the Templeton Prize during 2005: \\"Science tries to understand what our universe is like and how it works, including us humans. Religion is aimed at understanding the purpose and meaning of our universe, including our own lives. If the universe has a purpose or meaning, this must be reflected in its structure and functioning, and hence in science.\\" Townes died at the age of 99 in Oakland, California, on January 27, 2015. \\"He was one of the most important experimental physicists of the last century,\\" Reinhard Genzel, a professor of physics at Berkeley, said of Townes. \\"His strength was his curiosity and his unshakable optimism, based on his deep Christian spirituality.\\" =Science and religion= Townes' opinions concerning science and religion were expounded in his essays \\"The Convergence of Science and Religion\\", \\"Logic and Uncertainties in Science and Religion\\", and his book Making Waves. Townes felt that the beauty of nature is \\"obviously God-made\\" and that God created the universe for humans to emerge and flourish. He prayed every day and ultimately felt that religion is more important than science because it addresses the most important long-range question: the meaning and purpose of our lives. Townes' belief in the convergence of science and religion is based on claimed similarities: # Faith. Townes argued that the scientist has faith much like a religious person does, allowing him/her to work for years for an uncertain result. # Revelation. Townes claimed that many important scientific discoveries, like his invention of the maser/laser, occurred as a \\"flash\\" much more akin to religious revelation than interpreting data. # Proof. During this century the mathematician Godel discovered there can be no absolute proof in a scientific sense. Every proof requires a set of assumptions, and there is no way to check if those assumptions are self- consistent because other assumptions would be required. # Uncertainty. Townes believed that we should be open-minded to a better understanding of science and religion in the future. This will require us to modify our theories, but not abandon them. For example, at the start of the 20th century physics was largely deterministic. But when scientists began studying the quantum mechanics they realized that indeterminism and chance play a role in our universe. Both classical physics and quantum mechanics are correct and work well within their own bailiwick, and continue to be taught to students. Similarly, Townes believes growth of religious understanding will modify, but not make us abandon, our classic religious beliefs.

These moustache styles are named for their resemblance to the handlebars of a bicycle. It is also known as a spaghetti moustache, because of its stereotypical association with Italian men. The Handlebar Club humorously describes the style as \\"a hirsute appendage of the upper lip and with graspable extremities\\". History Similar styles of moustache are quite ancient, appearing on statues and other depictions of Iron Age Celts. In the United States, handlebar moustaches were worn in the later part of the 19th century by Wild West figures like Wyatt Earp. In Europe, handlebar moustaches were often worn by soldiers during the 19th century through roughly the World War I era. In 1972, to win a $300 \\"best facial hair\\" prize offered by team owner Charlie O. Finley, Oakland A's pitcher Rollie Fingers grew a handlebar moustache which he sported throughout his career. More recently, the contemporary hipster subculture has embraced the handlebar moustache by mocking conventional ideals of fashion, and by combining a highly manicured handlebar moustache with the portrayal of an unkempt appearance or a haphazardly selected clothing ensemble. =Famous handlebar moustaches= File:Wyatt Earp portrait.pngWyatt Earp File:William Howard Taft as Chief Justice SCOTUS.jpgWilliam Howard Taft File:Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany - 1902.jpgWilhelm II File:JStalin Secretary general CCCP 1942 flipped.jpgJoseph Stalin File:Cody-Buffalo-Bill-LOC.jpgBuffalo Bill File:Bhagat Singh 1929.jpgBhagat Singhhttp://www.iosworld.org/The%20Idea%20of%20Bhagat%20Singh.htmhttp://www.mulnivasisangh.com/shaheed- bhagat-singh-youth-icon-of-india/ File:Victor Napoleon.jpgPrince Victor Napoleon File:Giovanni-Verga.jpgGiovanni Verga File:Vincenzo Garioni.jpgVincenzo Garioni File:Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria - b&w.jpg;Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria File:Jimmy Edwards at CHRIS SHAW's Book Launch.jpgJimmy Edwards File:Rollie Fingers 01.26.2013.jpgRollie Fingers File:2017-10-03 FIS SGP 2017 Klingenthal Robert Johansson 004.jpgRobert Johansson File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-C06886, Paul v.

Biography Kastler was born in Guebwiller (Alsace, German Empire) and later attended the Lyc√©e Bartholdi in Colmar, Alsace, and √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure in Paris in 1921. After his studies, in 1926 he began teaching physics at the Lyc√©e of Mulhouse, and then taught at the University of Bordeaux, where he was a university professor until 1941. Georges Bruhat asked him to come back to the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure, where he finally obtained a chair in 1952. Collaborating with Jean Brossel, he researched quantum mechanics, the interaction between light and atoms, and spectroscopy. Kastler, working on combination of optical resonance and magnetic resonance, developed the technique of \\"optical pumping\\". Those works led to the completion of the theory of lasers and masers. He won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1966 \\"for the discovery and development of optical methods for studying Hertzian resonances in atoms\\". He was president of the board of the Institut d'optique th√©orique et appliqu√©e and served as the first chairman of the non-governmental organization (NGO) Action Against Hunger. Kastler also wrote poetry (in German). In 1971 he published Europe, ma patrie: Deutsche Lieder eines franz√∂sischen Europ√§ers (i.e. Europe, my fatherland: German songs of a French European). In 1978 he became foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1979, Kastler was awarded the Wilhelm Exner Medal.Editor, √ñGV. (2015). Wilhelm Exner Medal.

For example, an advocate who appears before a court with a single judge could describe that judge as \\"their tribunal\\". Many governmental bodies that are titled 'tribunals' are so described to emphasize that they are not courts of normal jurisdiction. For example, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda was a body specially constituted under international law; in Great Britain, employment tribunals are bodies set up to hear specific employment disputes. In many (but not all) cases, the word tribunal implies a judicial (or quasi-judicial) body with a lesser degree of formality than a court, to which the normal rules of evidence and procedure may not apply, and whose presiding officers are frequently neither judges nor magistrates. Private judicial bodies are also often styled 'tribunals'. However, the word tribunal is not conclusive of a body's function‚Äîfor example, in Great Britain, the Employment Appeal Tribunal is a superior court of record. The term is derived from the tribunes, magistrates of the Classical Roman Republic. \\"Tribunal\\" originally referred to the office of the tribunes, and the term is still sometimes used in this sense in historical writings.The tribunal was the platform upon which the presiding authority sat; having a raised position physically as symbolic of his higher position in regard to the adjudication of the law. By country =Australia= In Australia, the term tribunal generally implies a judicial body with a lesser degree of formality than a court, with a simplified legal procedure, often presided over by a lawyer (solicitor or barrister) who is not a judge or magistrate (often referred to as a member of the tribunal). In many cases the lawyers who function as tribunal members do so only on a part-time basis, and spend the greater part of their time carrying out other aspects of legal practice, such as representing clients. In many cases, the formal rules of evidence which apply in courts do not apply in tribunals, which enables tribunals to hear forms of evidence which courts may not be allowed to consider. Tribunals generally deal with simpler matters; while legal representation is permitted and not uncommon, self-representation is much more common in tribunals than in courts, and tribunal members and registry staff are generally more accustomed to dealing with self-represented parties than courts are. Appeal from a tribunal is to a court. Tribunals in the Australian judicial system include: *Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) *Migration Review Tribunal (MRT) *New South Wales Civil and Administrative Tribunal (NCAT) *Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal (QCAT) *State Administrative Tribunal of Western Australia (SAT) *Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) *South Australian Civil and Administration Tribunal (SACAT) In several Australian states, tribunals function as the equivalent of a small claims court. In the context of sport, \\"tribunal\\" frequently refers to the AFL Tribunal, the disciplinary body of the Australian Football League. =Bangladesh= In Bangladesh, tribunal refers to a court that serves some special purpose, of which Bangladesh has several. These have been set up to ensure speedy trial and reduce case congestion in the normal courts. Beside this, Article 117 of the constitution of Bangladesh empowers the parliament to set up one or more administrative tribunals. No court can entertain any proceeding or make any order in respect of any matter within the jurisdiction of such tribunal.The Constitution Of The People's Republic Of Bangladesh, Article-117 = Belgium = In the judicial system of Belgium, the names of the lower trial courts can be translated into English as 'tribunals' (, , ), whilst the higher appellate courts can be translated as 'courts' (, , ). = Brazil = The Judiciary of Brazil officially names \\"tribunal\\" the appeal court and the ones above it, always with more than one judge. The higher court is the Supremo Tribunal Federal (Supreme Federal Court), followed by the superior tribunals (Superior Tribunal de Justi√ßa, Tribunal Superior Eleitoral, Tribunal Superior do Trabalho, Superior Tribunal Militar). The federal justice is divided in regions, each region has its Tribunal Regional Federal (Regional Federal Court). Also, each state has its own Tribunal de Justi√ßa (Justice Court) =Canada= *Civil Resolution Tribunal, an online Tribunal in British Columbia (BC) *Landlord and Tenant Board, formerly the Ontario Rental Housing Tribunal *Ontario Condominium Authority, facilitates dispute resolution between condo owners and boards regarding issues such as noise complaints = Hong Kong = The following tribunals exist within the Judiciary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China: Lands, Small Claims, Labour, Obscene Articles. For public inquiries, commissions are set up instead, under the Commissions of Inquiry Ordinance. =India= There are tribunals for settling various administrative and tax-related disputes, including Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT), Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (CESTAT), National Green Tribunal (NGT), Competition Appellate Tribunal (COMPAT) and Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT), among others. In several states, Food Safety Appellate Tribunals have been created to hear appeals against orders of adjudicating officers for food safety (additional deputy commissioners). Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT) is a military tribunal in India. It was established under the Armed Forces Tribunal Act, 2007 . Permanent Lok Adalat (PUS) is a law court (also known as People's Court) and a Special Tribunal that have been set up in a number of districts throughout the country. It has been established under the Legal Services Authorities Act,1987. =Ireland= In the Republic of Ireland, tribunal popularly refers to a public inquiry established under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921. The main difference between a Parliamentary Inquiry (non statutory) and a Tribunal of Inquiry in Ireland is that non-statutory inquiries are not vested with the powers, privileges, and rights of the High Court. Tribunals of Inquiry are. Tribunals are established by resolution of the Houses of the Oireachtas to enquire into matters of urgent public importance. It is not a function of Tribunals to administer justice, their work is solely inquisitorial. Tribunals are obliged to report their findings to the Oireachtas. They have the power to enforce the attendance and examination of witnesses and the production of documents relevant to the work in hand. Tribunals can consist of one or more people. A layperson, or non-lawyer, may be the Sole member of a tribunal. =Netherlands= Historically, in the Netherlands, before the separation of lawmaking, law enforcement, and justice duties, all sentences were delivered by a tribunal of seven schepenen, or magistrates, appointed by the local count. Such a tribunal was called a Vierschaar, so called for a rope‚Äîor cord‚Äîthat was drawn (schaar or scheren) in a four-square dimension, wherein the judges sat on four benches. These benches were positioned in a square as well, with the defendant standing in the middle. Towns had the Vierschaar privilege to hear their own disputes. The Vierschaar was usually located in the town hall, and many historic town halls still have such a room, usually decorated with scenes from the Judgment of Solomon. =United Kingdom= The tribunal system of the United Kingdom is part of the national system of administrative justice. Though it has grown up on an ad hoc basis since the beginning of the twentieth century, from 2007 reforms were put in place to build a unified system with recognised judicial authority, routes of appeal and regulatory supervision. =United States= \\"Tribunal\\" is used in the U.S. generally to refer to courts or judicial bodies, as in the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct. The Ohio Rules of Professional Conduct, for instance, define \\"tribunal\\" as \\"a court, an arbitrator in a binding arbitration, or a legislative body, administrative agency, or other body acting in an adjudicative capacity.\\"http://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/legalresources/rules/profconduct/profconductrules.pdf By sector =Catholic Church= In the Catholic Church, ecclesiastical courts are called tribunals. Tribunals are distinguished by grade, while proceedings are distinguished by instance; for example, an archdiocesan tribunal may hear a cause in first instance if the cause is first brought before the archdiocesan tribunal, or, if the cause was first heard before the diocesan tribunal and is now appealed to the archdiocesan tribunal, the latter may hear the cause in second instance. Only the Roman Rota is competent to hear causes in third instance, with limited exceptions. Other tribunals are incompetent in third instance by reason of grade (ratione gradus), since they do not have the jurisdiction to judge in third instance. Tribunals include: *diocesan or eparchal tribunals (including archdiocesan or archeparchal tribunals) *interdiocesan tribunals, that is, a tribunal erected by the Holy See for more than one diocese, either as a tribunal of first instance, or as an appellate tribunal in second instance *the synod of bishops of patriarchal churches is the highest tribunal within the territory of the patriarchal church, without prejudice to the primacy of the Apostolic SeeCode of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 1062 ¬ß1. *ordinary tribunal of the patriarchal church, distinct from the eparchal tribunal of the patriarchal churchCode of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 1063 ¬ß1. *ordinary tribunals of the Apostolic See **Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura, the highest tribunal in the canon law of the Catholic Church **Tribunal of the Roman Rota, the highest appellate tribunal competent in most causes in second and third instance and some causes in first instance **Apostolic Penitentiary, an tribunal for matters concerning the internal forum **Supreme tribunal of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith for certain more grave delicts (canonical crimes) =In health sector= Tribunals also play an integral role in health sectors both within and across nations. Often referred to as \\"adjunctive tribunals\\", these quasi-judicial bodies possess regulatory, oversight, and dispute resolution powers to aid in health decision-making and governance. At the same time, the actual effects of adjunctive tribunals on health services are disputed, as little evidence exists to evaluate their efficacy. More empirical evaluations are needed to ensure that tribunals operate in a more evidence-based, systematic manner within the health sector.S.J. Hoffman, L.

It is an adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's high fantasy epic The Lord of the Rings, comprising The Fellowship of the Ring (1954) and the first half of The Two Towers (1954). Set in Middle-earth, the film follows a group of hobbits, elves, men, dwarves, and wizards who form a fellowship. They embark on a quest to destroy the One Ring made by the Dark Lord Sauron, and ensure his destruction. Ralph Bakshi encountered Tolkien's writing early in his career, and had made several attempts to produce The Lord of the Rings as an animated film before being given funding by producer Saul Zaentz and distributor United Artists. The film is notable for its extensive use of rotoscoping, a technique in which scenes are first shot in live-action, then traced onto animation cels. It uses a hybrid of traditional cel animation and rotoscoped live action footage. The film features the voices of William Squire, John Hurt, Michael Graham Cox, and Anthony Daniels, and was one of the first animated films to be presented theatrically in the Dolby Stereo sound system. The screenplay was written by Peter S. Beagle, based on an earlier draft by Chris Conkling. Although Bakshi's The Lord of the Rings was a financial success, it received mixed reactions from critics, and there was no official sequel to cover the remainder of the story. Nonetheless, the film became a cult classic that continued to run as a matinee and a midnight movie for nearly two decades, and was an influence on Peter Jackson's trilogy, as detailed in the DVD extras of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. Plot Early in the Second Age of Middle-earth, elven smiths forge nine Rings of Power for mortal men, seven for the Dwarf-Lords, and three for the Elf-Kings. Soon after, the Dark Lord Sauron makes the One Ring, and uses it to attempt to conquer Middle-earth. After defeating Sauron, Prince Isildur takes the Ring, but after he is killed by orcs, the Ring lies at the bottom of the river Anduin for over 2,500 years. Over time, Sauron captures the Nine Rings and transforms their owners into the Ringwraiths. The One Ring is discovered by D√©agol, whose kinsman, Sm√©agol, kills him and takes the Ring for himself. The Ring twists his body and mind, and he becomes the creature Gollum (Peter Woodthorpe) who takes it with him into the Misty Mountains. Hundreds of years later, Bilbo Baggins (Norman Bird) finds the Ring in Gollum's cave and brings it back with him to the Shire. Decades later, during Bilbo's birthday celebration, the wizard Gandalf (William Squire) tells him to leave the Ring for his nephew Frodo (Christopher Guard). Bilbo reluctantly agrees, and departs for Rivendell. Seventeen years pass, during which Gandalf learns that evil forces have discovered that the Ring is in the possession of a Baggins. Gandalf meets Frodo to explain the Ring's history and the danger it poses; and Frodo leaves his home, taking the Ring with him. He is accompanied by three hobbits, his cousins, Pippin (Dominic Guard), Merry (Simon Chandler), and his gardner Sam (Michael Scholes). After a narrow escape from the Ringwraiths, the hobbits eventually come to Bree, from which Aragorn (John Hurt) leads them to Rivendell. Frodo is stabbed atop Weathertop mountain by the chief of the Ringwraiths, and becomes sickened as the journey progresses. The Ringwraiths catch up with them shortly after they meet the elf Legolas (Anthony Daniels); and at a standoff at the ford of Rivendell, the Ringwraiths are swept away by the river. At Rivendell, Frodo is healed by Elrond (Andr√© Morell). He meets Gandalf again, after the latter escapes the corrupt wizard Saruman (Fraser Kerr), who plans to ally with Sauron but also wants the Ring for himself. Frodo volunteers to go to Mordor, where the Ring can be destroyed. Thereafter Frodo sets off from Rivendell with eight companions: Gandalf; Aragorn; Boromir (Michael Graham Cox), son of the Steward of Gondor; Legolas; Gimli (David Buck) the dwarf, along with Pippin, Merry, and Sam. Their attempt to cross the Misty Mountains is foiled by heavy snow, and they are forced into Moria. There, they are attacked by orcs, and Gandalf falls into an abyss while battling a balrog. The remaining Fellowship continue through the elf-haven Lothl√≥rien, where they meet the elf queen Galadriel (Annette Crosbie). Boromir tries to take the Ring from Frodo, and Frodo decides to continue his quest alone; but Sam insists on accompanying him. Boromir is killed by orcs while trying to defend Merry and Pippin. Merry and Pippin are captured by the orcs, who intend to take them to Isengard through the land of Rohan. The captured hobbits escape and flee into Fangorn Forest, where they meet Treebeard (John Westbrook). Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas track Merry and Pippin into the forest, where they are reunited with Gandalf, who was reborn after destroying the balrog. The five then ride to Rohan's capital, Edoras, where Gandalf persuades King Th√©oden (Philip Stone) that his people are in danger. Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas then travel to the Helm's Deep. Frodo and Sam discover Gollum stalking them in an attempt to reclaim the ring, and capture him; but spare his life in return for guidance to Mount Doom. Gollum eventually begins plotting against them, and wonders if \\"she\\" might help. At Helm's Deep, Th√©oden's forces resist the orcs sent by Saruman, until Gandalf arrives with the absent Riders of Rohan, destroying the orc army.

In 1957, the young animator started trying to convince people that the story could be told in animation, and even began developing an original science- fantasy film, which would become Wizards, as \\"Tolkien in the American idiom\\". In 1969, the rights were passed to United Artists, where an \\"elegant\\" Peter Shaffer script was abandoned. Denis O'Dell was interested in producing a film for the Beatles, and approached directors David Lean (busy with Ryan's Daughter), Stanley Kubrick (who deemed it \\"unfilmable\\") and Michaelangelo Antonioni. John Boorman was commissioned to write a script in late 1969, but it was deemed too expensive in 1970. Bakshi believed Disney had the rights prior, but while they were interested, they never claimed the rights. He said UA spent $800,000 on development for the films, engaging Stanley Kubrick and John Boorman to film. Bakshi approached United Artists when he learned (from a 1974 issue of Variety) that Boorman's script was abandoned. Learning that Boorman intended to produce all three parts of The Lord of the Rings as a single film, Bakshi commented, \\"I thought that was madness, certainly a lack of character on Boorman's part. Why would you want to tamper with anything Tolkien did?\\" Bakshi began making a \\"yearly trek\\" to United Artists. Bakshi had since achieved box office success producing adult-oriented animated films such as Fritz the Cat but his recent film, Coonskin, tanked, and he later clarified that he thought The Lord of the Rings could \\"make some money\\" so as to save his studio. In 1975, Bakshi convinced United Artists executive Mike Medavoy to produce The Lord of the Rings as two or three animated films, and a Hobbit prequel. Medavoy offered him Boorman's script, which Bakshi refused, saying that Boorman \\"didn't understand it\\" and that his script would have made for a cheap film like \\"a Roger Corman film\\". Although he was later keen to regroup with Boorman for his script (and his surrogate project, Excalibur), Bakshi claimed Medavoy didn't want to produce his film at the time, but allowed him to shop it around if he could get another studio to pay for the expenses on Boorman's script. The Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer office was located in the same building. Bakshi entered the office of then-president Dan Melnick, who was having a meeting with Peter Bogdanavich. Knowing Melnick read the books, Bakshi \\"thought he would understand what The Rings meant, because UA did not\\". He convinced Melnick's secretary to tell him \\"Ralph Bakshi is here with the rights to The Lord of the Rings\\",Forging Through the Darkness: the Ralph Bakshi Vision for The Lord of the Rings which caused Melnick to cut the meeting with Bogdanavich short, much to the latter's anger. Bakshi and Melnick made a deal with Mike Medavoy at United Artists to buy the Boorman script. \\"The Boorman script cost $3 million, so Boorman was happy by the pool, screaming and laughing and drinking, 'cause he got $3 million for his script to be thrown out.\\" Boorman, however, was unhappy with the project going to animation after Tolkien once wrote to him, pleased that he was doing it in live-action. He never saw Bakshi's film, and after it was released, tried to remake his live-action version with Medavoy. Work began on scripts and storyboards. When Melnick was fired from MGM in 1976, Bakshi's studio had spent between $200-600,000, and the new executive Dick Shepherd hadn't read the books and, according to Bakshi, obliviously asked whether The Lord of the Rings is about a wedding, and didn't want to make the movie. Bakshi then contacted Saul Zaentz (who had helped finance Fritz the Cat) to ask him to produce The Lord of the Rings, and Zaentz agreed. Medavoy and United Artists returned to the production as the distributors instead of MGM. Before the production started, Bakshi met with Tolkien's daughter Priscilla to discuss how the film would be made. She showed him the room where her father did his writing and drawing. Bakshi says, \\"My promise to Tolkien's daughter was to be pure to the book. I wasn't going to say, 'Hey, throw out Gollum and change these two characters.' My job was to say, 'This is what the genius said.'\\" Bakshi was approached by Mick Jagger who wanted to play Frodo, but at the time the roles were already cast and recorded. David Carradine also approached Bakshi, offering to play Aragorn and even suggested that Bakshi do it in live- action, and while Bakshi's contract allowed this, he said it couldn't be done and that he'd \\"always seen it as animation\\". He said it was impossible to make it in live-action without it being \\"tacky\\". =Screenwriting= Bakshi began developing the script himself. Learning of the project, Chris Conkling got an interview with Bakshi but was initially hired to \\"do research, to say what the costumes should look like or what the characters would be doing at any given time\\". Together, they first decided how to break the films down. When they started, they contemplated a three-film structure, but \\"we didn't know how that middle film would work\\" without a beginning and an end. Conkling even started writing a treatment for one long, three-and-a-half hour feature of the entire work, but eventually settled on scripts for two 150-minute films, the first of which was titled \\"The Lord of the Rings, Part One: The Fellowship\\". The second draft of the screenplay, written by Conkling, told the bulk of the story in flashback, from Merry Brandybuck's point of view, so as to lead into the sequel. This version included Tom Bombadil, who rescues the Hobbits from the Barrow Downs, as well as Farmer Maggot, the Old Forest, Glorfindel, Arwen, and several songs. Bakshi felt it was \\"a much too drastic departure from Tolkien\\". Conkling began writing a draft that was \\"more straightforward and true to the source\\" which would end with Saruman's death and Frodo and Sam entering Mordor, secretly followed by Gollum. Still displeased, Bakshi and Zaentz called in fantasy author Peter S. Beagle for a rewrite. Beagle said a complete overhaul of the script was required, and according to the website of publisher Conlan Press, Beagle wrote multiple drafts of the script for only $5,000, on the strength of promises from Saul Zaentz to hire him for other, better-paying projects afterward. Zaentz later reneged on these promises. Beagle's first draft eliminated the framing device and told the story beginning with Bilbo's Farewell Party, climaxing with the Battle of Helm's Deep, and ending with the cliffhanger of Gollum leading Frodo and Sam to Shelob. The revised draft includes a brief prologue to reveal the history of the Ring. Fans threatened Bakshi that \\"he'd better get it right\\" and according to artists Mike Ploog, Bakshi would constantly revise the story to include certain beats at the behest of such fans. While writing, Zaentz found the similarity of the names Saruman and Sauron confusing, and it was decided to rename him \\"Ruman\\" or \\"Aruman\\" but when Beagle was rewriting the shooting script, he began reinstating Saruman while the scenes were being recorded, which resulted in inconsistency in the wizard's name. =Differences from the book= The film makes some deviations from the book, but overall follows Tolkien's narrative quite closely. Of the adaptation process, Bakshi stated that elements of the story \\"had to be left out but nothing in the story was really altered\\". The film greatly condenses Frodo's journey from Bag End to Bree. Stop-overs at Farmer Maggot's house, Frodo's home in Buckland, and the house of the mysterious Tom Bombadil deep in the Old Forest are omitted. Maggot and his family and Bombadil and his wife Goldberry are thus all omitted, along with Fatty Bolger, a hobbit who accompanied Frodo at the beginning. According to Bakshi, the character of Tom Bombadil was dropped because \\"he didn't move the story along.\\" Additionally, the character Glorfindel is amalgamated with Legolas. =Directing= Bakshi in January 2009 Bakshi said that one of the problems with the production was that the film was an epic, because \\"epics tend to drag. The biggest challenge was to be true to the book.\\" When asked what he was trying to accomplish with the film, Bakshi stated \\"The goal was to bring as much quality as possible to the work. I wanted real illustration as opposed to cartoons.\\" Bakshi said that descriptions of the characters were not included because they are seen in the film: While he was aware of the work of illustrators like the brothers Hildebrandt, Bakshi insisted it did not affect the style of his film. Instead, his major artistic influences on the film were classical illustrators such as Howard Pyle and N. C. Wyeth. =Animation= Publicity for the film announced that Bakshi had created \\"the first movie painting\\" by utilizing \\"an entirely new technique in filmmaking\\". Much of the film used live-action footage which was then rotoscoped to produce an animated look. This saved production costs and gave the animated characters a more realistic look. In animation historian Jerry Beck's The Animated Movie Guide, reviewer Marea Boylan writes that \\"up to that point, animated films had not depicted extensive battle scenes with hundreds of characters. By using the rotoscope, Bakshi could trace highly complex scenes from live-action footage and transform them into animation, thereby taking advantage of the complexity live-action film can capture without incurring the exorbitant costs of producing a live-action film.\\" Bakshi went to England to recruit a voice cast from the BBC Drama Repertory Company, including Christopher Guard, William Squire, Michael Scholes, Anthony Daniels, and John Hurt. Daniels remembers that \\"The whole cast were in the same studio but we all had to leave a two second gap between the lines which made for rather stilted dialogue.\\" For the live-action portion of the production, Bakshi and his cast and crew went to Spain, where the rotoscope models acted out their parts in costume in the open or in empty soundstages. Additional photography took place in Death Valley. Bakshi was so terrified of the horses used in the shoot that he directed those scenes from inside the caravan. Bakshi had a difficult working relationship with producer Saul Zaentz. When Saul would bring potential investors to Bakshi's studio, he would always show them the same sequence, of Frodo falling off of his horse at the Ford (which was his stunt double actually falling over). During the middle of a large shoot, union bosses called for a lunch break, and Bakshi secretly shot footage of actors in Orc costumes moving toward the craft service table, and used the footage in the film. Many of the actors who contributed voices to this production also acted out their parts for rotoscoped scenes. The actions of Bilbo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee were performed by Billy Barty, while Sharon Baird served as the performance model for Frodo Baggins. Other performers used on the rotoscoping session included John A. Neris as Gandalf, Walt Robles as Aragorn, Felix Silla as Gollum, Jeri Lea Ray as Galadriel, and Aesop Aquarian as Gimli. Although some cel animation was produced and shot for the film, very little of it appears in the final film. Most of the film's crowd and battle scenes use a different technique, in which live-action footage is solarized (per an interview with the film's cinematographer, Timothy Galfas, in the documentary Forging Through the Darkness: the Ralph Bakshi Vision for The Lord of the Rings) to produce a more three-dimensional look. In a few shots the two techniques are combined. Bakshi claimed he \\"didn't start thinking about shooting the film totally in live action until I saw it really start to work so well. I learned lots of things about the process, like rippling. One scene, some figures were standing on a hill and a big gust of wind came up and the shadows moved back and forth on the clothes and it was unbelievable in animation. I don't think I could get the feeling of cold on the screen without showing snow or an icicle on some guy's nose. The characters have weight and they move correctly.\\" After the Spanish film development lab discovered that telephone lines, helicopters, and cars could be seen in the footage Bakshi had shot, they tried to incinerate the footage, telling Bakshi's first assistant director that \\"if that kind of sloppy cinematography got out, no one from Hollywood would ever come back to Spain to shoot again.\\" Following the live-action shoot, each frame of the live footage was printed out, and placed behind an animation cel. The details of each frame were copied and painted onto the cel. Both the live-action and animated sequences were storyboarded. Of the production, Bakshi is quoted as saying, Although he continued to use rotoscoping in American Pop, Hey Good Lookin', and Fire and Ice, Bakshi later regretted his use of rotoscoping, stating that he felt that it was a mistake to trace the source footage rather than using it as a guide. By the time Bakshi was done animating, he had only four weeks left to cut the film from a nearly 150-minute rough cut. Restoring a piece of animation where Gandalf fights the Balrog (replaced in the finished film by a photomontage), Eddie Bakshi remarked that little of the film was left on the cutting room floor. Bakshi asked three additional months to edit the film, but was declined. After test-screenings, it was decided to re-cut the end of the picture so that Gollum would resolve leading Frodo and Sam to Shelob before cutting back to Helm's Deep, so as to not end the film on a cliffhanger. Working on the film were Tim Burton as well as Mike Ploog (co-creator of Werewolf by Night). Ploog also was involved in other Ralph Bakshi animations, notably Wizards and Hey Good Lookin'. =Music= The film score was composed by Leonard Rosenman. Bakshi wanted to include music by Led Zeppelin but producer Saul Zaentz insisted upon an orchestral score because he would not be able to release the band's music on his Fantasy Records label. Rosenman wanted a large score, involving a 100-piece orchestra, 100-piece mixed choir and 100-piece boy choir, but ended up with a smaller ensemble. Bakshi initially called his score \\"majestic\\", but later stated that he hated Rosenman's score, which he found to be too clich√©. In Lord of the Rings: Popular Culture in Global Context, Ernest Mathijs writes that Rosenman's score \\"is a middle ground between his more sonorous but dissonant earlier scores and his more traditional (and less challenging) sounding music [...] In the final analysis, Rosenman's score has little that marks it out as distinctively about Middle Earth, relying on traditions of music (including film music) more than any specific attempt to paint a musical picture of the different lands and peoples of Tolkien's imagination.\\" The film's score was issued as a double-LP soundtrack album in 1978. A limited collector edition was created by Fantasy Records as a picture disc double LP featuring four scenes: The Hobbits leaving Hobbiton, The Ringwraiths at Bree, Gandalf and the Balrog, Journey with the Orcs. In 2001, the album was reissued on compact disc, with bonus tracks. Sequel The film was originally intended to be distributed as The Lord of the Rings Part I. At the time, Arthur Krim resigned from United Artists and was replaced by Andy Albeck. According to Bakshi, when he completed the film, United Artists executives told him that they were planning to release the film without indicating that a sequel would follow, because they felt that audiences would not pay to see half of a film: Although UA found that the film, while financially successful, \\"failed to overwhelm audiences\\", Bakshi did begin working on a sequel, and even had some B-roll footage shot. The Film Book of J.R.R. Tolkien's the Lord of the Rings, published by Ballantine Books on October 12, 1978, still referred to the sequel in the book's inside cover jacket. Indeed, in interviews Bakshi talked about doing \\"a part two film picking up where this leaves off\\" and even boasted that the second film could \\"pick up on sequences that we missed in the first book\\". Zaentz even tried to stop the Rankin-Bass The Return of the King TV special (which was already storyboarded before Bakshi's film came out) from airing, so as to not clash with Bakshi's sequel. A merchandise catalog containing a letter from Zaentz' company dated January 1980, claims writing is on the way for Part II, \\"scheduled for release during the Spring or Summer of 1981.\\" Bakshi was aware of Rankin/Bass The Hobbit TV special, and angrily commented that \\"Lord of the Rings is not going to have any song for the sake of a record album.\\" During the lawsuit, he commented that \\"They‚Äôre not going to stop us from doing The Lord of the Rings and they won‚Äôt stop us from doing The Hobbit. Anyone who saw their version of The Hobbit know it has nothing to do with the quality and style of our feature. My life isn‚Äôt going to be altered by what Rankin-Bass choses to do badly.‚Äù Years later, he called their film \\"an awful, rip-off version of The Hobbit.\\" Bakshi found the two years spent on Rings immensly stressful, and the fan reaction was scathing. He took comfort in talking to Priscila Tolkien, who said she loved it, but got into an argument with Zaentz and refused to do Part Two. Reports vary as to whether the argument had to do with the dropping of the \\"Part One\\" subtitle or Bakshi's fee for the sequel. Bakshi said he was \\"proud to have made part one\\" and that his work was \\"there for anyone who would make part two\\". In interviews leading up to the year 2000, he still toyed with the idea of making the sequel. For his part, Saul Zaentz said he kept in touch with Bakshi, but also confided to John Boorman that making the film was the worst experience of his life, which made him protective of the property. Indeed, he commented that the film \\"wasn't as good as we should have made\\" and later remarked that an \\"animated [film] couldn't do it. It was just too complex for animated to handle it, with the emotion that was needed and the size and scope.\\" During development of the live-action films, Bakshi said he was approached by Warner Brothers to make the second part, but refused as he was angry of not being notified about the live-action film. He did use the renewed interest in his film to restore it to DVD, and had the final line redubbed to bolster the film's sense of finality. After the live-action films found success, Bakshi stated that he would never have made the film if he had known what would happen during the production. He is quoted as saying that the reason he made the film was \\"to save it for Tolkien, because I loved the Rings very much\\". Bakshi also stated that he felt that the film \\"took more out of me than I got back\\". Reception =Box office= The Lord of the Rings was a financial success. Reports of the budget vary from $4 to $8 million, and as high as $12, while the film grossed $30.5 million at the United States and Canadian box office. In the United Kingdom, the film grossed over $3.2 million. =Awards and nominations= The film was nominated for both the Hugo and Saturn Awards for Best Dramatic Presentation and Best Fantasy Film, respectively. Leonard Rosenman's score was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Original Motion Picture Score, and Bakshi won a Golden Gryphon award for the film at the Giffoni Film Festival. =Critical response= Critics were generally mixed in their responses to the film, but generally considered it to be a \\"flawed but inspired interpretation\\". Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, which compiles reviews from a wide range of critics, gives the film a score of 52% based on reviews from 42 critics with the consensus: \\"Ralph Bakshi's valiant attempt at rendering Tolkien's magnum opus in rotoscope never lives up to the grandeur of its source material, with a compressed running time that flattens the sweeping story and experimental animation that is more bizarre than magical.\\" Frank Barrow of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film was \\"daring and unusual in concept\\". Joseph Gelmis of Newsday wrote that \\"the film's principal reward is a visual experience unlike anything that other animated features are doing at the moment.\\" Roger Ebert called Bakshi's effort a \\"mixed blessing\\" and \\"an entirely respectable, occasionally impressive job ... [which] still falls far short of the charm and sweep of the original story.\\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times called the film \\"both numbing and impressive\\". David Denby of New York magazine felt that the film would not make sense to viewers who had not previously read the book. Denby wrote that the film was too dark and lacked humour, concluding that \\"The lurid, meaningless violence of this movie left me exhausted and sickened by the end.\\" Michael Barrier, an animation historian, described The Lord of The Rings as one of two films that demonstrated \\"that Bakshi was utterly lacking in the artistic self-discipline that might have permitted him to outgrow his limitations.\\"Barrier, Michael. Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age. Oxford University Press US, 2003. 572. Retrieved on October 15, 2009. , . =Recognition= The film has been cited as an influence on director Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, although Jackson said that \\"our film is stylistically very different and the design is different.\\"The Lord of the rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), Director's Commentary. Jackson had watched Bakshi's previous films, including Wizards, and at the age of seventeen went to see the film when it premiered in New Zealand. He had \\"heard the name\\" of the book but was yet to read it, nor had he seen the Rankin/Bass TV specials. A few weeks after watching the film, he bought a tie-in single-volume, paperback edition of the book, followed up by The Hobbit and The Silmarillion, as well as a recording of the 1981 radio adaptation, in which two of Bakshi's cast reprised their roles. Reading about attempts to make the films live-action by Boorman and the Beatles contacting Kubrick and David Lean to do the same, Jackson agreed animation was the most sensible choice at the time. Jackson remembers Bakshi's film as a \\"brave and ambitious attempt\\".Peter Jackson, as quoted at the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood, on February 6, 2004. Audio ; Retrieved on August 22, 2007. In another interview, Jackson stated that it had \\"some quaint sequences in Hobbiton, a creepy encounter with the Black Rider on the road, and a few quite good battle scenes\\" but \\"about half way through, the storytelling became very disjointed\\" and it became \\"confusing\\" and \\"incoherent\\". He and Fran Walsh remarked that Bakshi's Treebeard \\"looked like a talking carrot\\". Jackson watched the film for the first time since its premiere in 1997, when Harvey Weinstein screened it to begin the story conferences. Ahead of the films' release, Bakshi said he did not \\"understand it\\" but that he does \\"wish it to be a good movie\\". He felt bad that he wasn't contacted by Zaentz, who was involved in the project, and erroneously said they were screening his film at New Line while working on the live-action films. Nevertheless, he clarified he wished the filmmakers success. He claims Warner Brothers approached him with a proposal to make part two at the time, but he complained that they didn't involve him in the live-action film, and refused. After the films were released Bakshi said that while, \\"on the creative side\\", he does \\"feel good that Peter Jackson continued\\" he begrudged Saul Zaentz for not notifying him of the live-action films. He also said that, with his own film already made, Jackson could study it: \\"I'm glad Peter Jackson had a movie to look at‚ÄîI never did. And certainly there's a lot to learn from watching any movie, both its mistakes and when it works. So he had a little easier time than I did, and a lot better budget.\\" Bakshi had never watched the films, but saw trailers and while he praised the special effects, he said that Jackson \\"didn't understand\\" Tolkien and created \\"special effects garbage\\" to sell toys, saying his film has \\"more heart\\" and that, had he a similar budget, would have made a better film. Bakshi was told the live-action film was derivative of his own, and blamed Jackson for not acknowledging this influence: \\"Peter Jackson did say that the first film inspired him to go on and do the series, but that happened after I was bitching and moaning to a lot of interviewers that he said at the beginning that he never saw the movie. I thought that was kind of fucked up.\\" Bakshi then said that Jackson mentioned his influence \\"only once\\" as \\"PR bologny\\". Jackson, who took a fan photograph with Bakshi in 1993, remains puzzled about Bakshi's indignation. In 2015, Bakshi apologized for some of his remarks and, in 2018, had clarified that he's \\"not mad about it. I don't care.\\" Bakshi's animator Mike Ploog and writer Peter Beagle both praised the live-action film. In fact, Jackson did acknowledge Bakshi's film as early as 1998, when he told a worried fan that he hoped to outdo Bakshi, as well as mentioning in the behind-the-scenes features that \\"the black Riders galloping out of Bree was an image I remember very clearly [...] from the Ralph Bakshi film.\\"The Fellowship of the Ring Appendices: From Book to Script. In the audio commentary to The Fellowship of the Ring, Jackson says Bakshi's film introduced him to The Lord of the Rings and \\"inspired me to read the book\\" and in a 2001 interview, said he \\"enjoyed [the film] and wanted to know more\\". On the audio commentary for the DVD release of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, Jackson acknowledges one shot, a low angle of a hobbit at Bilbo's birthday party shouting \\"Proudfeet!\\", as an intentional homage to Bakshi's film, which Jackson thought was \\"a brilliant angle\\". Another influence came through John Howe, who unwittingly copied a scene from Bakshi's film in a painting that depicted the four Hobbits hiding under a branch from a Ringwraith, which Jackson turned into a scene in the film. Jackson's decision to do a scene that misdirects the audience to think the wraiths slew the Hobbits may also derive from Bakshi. Legacy The film was adapted into comic book form with artwork by Spanish artist Luis Bermejo, under licence from Tolkien Enterprises. Three issues were published for the European market, starting in 1979, and were not published in the United States or translated into English due to copyright problems. Bakshi's film sparked enough interest in Tolkien's work to provoke not only an animated TV special produced by the Rankin-Bass animation studio based on The Return of the King, but a complete adaptation of The Lord of the Rings on BBC Radio. For this broadcast, Michael Graham Cox and Peter Woodthorpe reprised their roles of Boromir and Gollum, respectively. Warner Bros. (the rights holder to the post-1973 Rankin-Bass library and the pre-1990 Saul Zaentz theatrical library) first released the film on DVD in September 2001, one of which being through the Warner Bros. Family Entertainment label. While the VHS version ends with the narrator saying \\"Here ends the first part of the history of the War of the Ring.\\", the DVD version has an alternate narration: \\"The forces of darkness were driven forever from the face of Middle-Earth by the valiant friends of Frodo. As their gallant battle ended, so, too, ends the first great tale of The Lord of the Rings.\\" Later, The Lord of the Rings was released in a deluxe edition on Blu-ray and DVD on 6 April 2010. The Lord of the Rings was selected as the 36th greatest animated film by Time Out magazine, and ranked as the 90th greatest animated film of all time by the Online Film Critics Society.

In 2005, Schrieffer fell asleep while driving and received a sentence of two years in prison for vehicular manslaughter which killed one, and injured seven other people.  Life and career  Schrieffer was born in Oak Park, Illinois, the son of Louise (Anderson) and John Henry Schrieffer. His family moved in 1940 to Manhasset, New York, and then in 1947 to Eustis, Florida, where his father, a former pharmaceutical salesman, began a career in the citrus industry. In his Florida days, Schrieffer enjoyed playing with homemade rockets and ham radio, a hobby that sparked an interest in electrical engineering. After graduating from Eustis High School in 1949, Schrieffer was admitted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where for two years he majored in electrical engineering before switching to physics in his junior year. He completed a bachelor's thesis on multiplets in heavy atoms under the direction of John C. Slater in 1953. Pursuing an interest in solid-state physics, Schrieffer began graduate studies at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, where he was hired immediately as a research assistant to Bardeen. After working out a theoretical problem of electrical conduction on semiconductor surfaces, Schrieffer spent a year in the laboratory, applying the theory to several surface problems. In his third year of graduate studies, he joined Bardeen and Cooper in developing the theory of superconductivity. Schrieffer recalled that in January 1957 he was on a subway in New York City when he had an idea of how to describe mathematically the ground state of superconducting atoms. Schrieffer and Bardeen's collaborator Cooper had discovered that electrons in a superconductor are grouped in pairs, now called Cooper pairs, and that the motions of all Cooper pairs within a single superconductor are correlated and function as a single entity due to phonon-electron interactions. Schrieffer's mathematical breakthrough was to describe the behavior of all Cooper pairs at the same time, instead of each individual pair. The day after returning to Illinois, Schrieffer showed his equations to Bardeen, who immediately realized they were the solution to the problem. The BCS theory (Bardeen-Cooper- Schrieffer) of superconductivity, as it is now known, accounted for more than 30 years of experimental results that had stymied some of the greatest theorists in physics. After completing his doctoral dissertation on the theory of superconductivity, Schrieffer spent the 1957‚Äì1958 academic year as a National Science Foundation fellow at the University of Birmingham in England and at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen, where he continued research into superconductivity. Following a year as assistant professor at the University of Chicago, he returned to the University of Illinois in 1959 as a faculty member. In 1960, he went back to the Bohr Institute for a summer visit, during which he became engaged to Anne Grete Thomsen whom he married at Christmas of that year. Two years later, Schrieffer joined the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, and, in 1964, Schrieffer published his book on the BCS theory, Theory of Superconductivity. He held honorary degrees from the Technical University of Munich and the University of Geneva. In 1968 Schrieffer, along with Cooper, were awarded the Comstock Prize in Physics from the National Academy of Sciences. He was awarded the Oliver E. Buckley Condensed Matter Prize by the American Physical Society the same year. In 1972, Schrieffer along with Bardeen and Cooper won the 1972 Nobel Prize in Physics for developing the BCS theory. In 1980, Schrieffer became a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and rose to chancellor professor in 1984, serving as director of the university's Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics. In 1992, Florida State University appointed Schrieffer as a university eminent scholar professor and chief scientist of the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, where he continued to pursue one of the great goals in physics: room temperature superconductivity. On September 24, 2004, while driving with a suspended license, Schrieffer was involved in an automobile accident that killed one person and injured seven others. Schrieffer was said to have fallen asleep at the wheel of his car. On November 6, 2005, he was sentenced to two years in prison for vehicular manslaughter. Schrieffer was incarcerated in Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility at Rock Mountain near San Diego, California. He died in late July 2019 at a nursing facility in Florida while sleeping. He was 88 years old.

As well as being one of the primary areas of research in set theory, it has applications to other areas of mathematics such as functional analysis, ergodic theory, the study of operator algebras and group actions, and mathematical logic.  Polish spaces  Descriptive set theory begins with the study of Polish spaces and their Borel sets. A Polish space is a second- countable topological space that is metrizable with a complete metric. Heuristically, it is a complete separable metric space whose metric has been \\"forgotten\\". Examples include the real line \\\\mathbb{R}, the Baire space \\\\mathcal{N}, the Cantor space \\\\mathcal{C}, and the Hilbert cube I^{\\\\mathbb{N}}. = Universality properties = The class of Polish spaces has several universality properties, which show that there is no loss of generality in considering Polish spaces of certain restricted forms. * Every Polish space is homeomorphic to a GŒ¥ subspace of the Hilbert cube, and every GŒ¥ subspace of the Hilbert cube is Polish. * Every Polish space is obtained as a continuous image of Baire space; in fact every Polish space is the image of a continuous bijection defined on a closed subset of Baire space. Similarly, every compact Polish space is a continuous image of Cantor space. Because of these universality properties, and because the Baire space \\\\mathcal{N} has the convenient property that it is homeomorphic to \\\\mathcal{N}^\\\\omega, many results in descriptive set theory are proved in the context of Baire space alone.  Borel sets  The class of Borel sets of a topological space X consists of all sets in the smallest œÉ-algebra containing the open sets of X. This means that the Borel sets of X are the smallest collection of sets such that: * Every open subset of X is a Borel set. * If A is a Borel set, so is X \\\\setminus A. That is, the class of Borel sets are closed under complementation. * If An is a Borel set for each natural number n, then the union \\\\bigcup A_n is a Borel set. That is, the Borel sets are closed under countable unions. A fundamental result shows that any two uncountable Polish spaces X and Y are Borel isomorphic: there is a bijection from X to Y such that the preimage of any Borel set is Borel, and the image of any Borel set is Borel. This gives additional justification to the practice of restricting attention to Baire space and Cantor space, since these and any other Polish spaces are all isomorphic at the level of Borel sets. = Borel hierarchy = Each Borel set of a Polish space is classified in the Borel hierarchy based on how many times the operations of countable union and complementation must be used to obtain the set, beginning from open sets. The classification is in terms of countable ordinal numbers. For each nonzero countable ordinal Œ± there are classes \\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma}^0_\\\\alpha, \\\\mathbf{\\\\Pi}^0_\\\\alpha, and \\\\mathbf{\\\\Delta}^0_\\\\alpha. * Every open set is declared to be \\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma}^0_1. * A set is declared to be \\\\mathbf{\\\\Pi}^0_\\\\alpha if and only if its complement is \\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma}^0_\\\\alpha. * A set A is declared to be \\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma}^0_\\\\delta, Œ¥ > 1, if there is a sequence ‚ü® Ai ‚ü© of sets, each of which is \\\\mathbf{\\\\Pi}^0_{\\\\lambda(i)} for some Œª(i) < Œ¥, such that A = \\\\bigcup A_i. * A set is \\\\mathbf{\\\\Delta}^0_\\\\alpha if and only if it is both \\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma}^0_\\\\alpha and \\\\mathbf{\\\\Pi}^0_\\\\alpha. A theorem shows that any set that is \\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma}^0_\\\\alpha or \\\\mathbf{\\\\Pi}^0_\\\\alpha is \\\\mathbf{\\\\Delta}^0_{\\\\alpha + 1}, and any \\\\mathbf{\\\\Delta}^0_\\\\beta set is both \\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma}^0_\\\\alpha and \\\\mathbf{\\\\Pi}^0_\\\\alpha for all Œ± > Œ≤. Thus the hierarchy has the following structure, where arrows indicate inclusion. \\\\begin{matrix} & & \\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma}^0_1 & & & & \\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma}^0_2 & & \\\\cdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ & earrow & & \\\\searrow & & earrow \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{\\\\Delta}^0_1 & & & & \\\\mathbf{\\\\Delta}^0_2 & & & & \\\\cdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\searrow & & earrow & & \\\\searrow \\\\\\\\\\\\ & & \\\\mathbf{\\\\Pi}^0_1 & & & & \\\\mathbf{\\\\Pi}^0_2 & & \\\\cdots \\\\end{matrix}\\\\begin{matrix} & & \\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma}^0_\\\\alpha & & & \\\\cdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ & earrow & & \\\\searrow \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\quad \\\\mathbf{\\\\Delta}^0_\\\\alpha & & & & \\\\mathbf{\\\\Delta}^0_{\\\\alpha + 1} & \\\\cdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\searrow & & earrow \\\\\\\\\\\\ & & \\\\mathbf{\\\\Pi}^0_\\\\alpha & & & \\\\cdots \\\\end{matrix} = Regularity properties of Borel sets = Classical descriptive set theory includes the study of regularity properties of Borel sets. For example, all Borel sets of a Polish space have the property of Baire and the perfect set property. Modern descriptive set theory includes the study of the ways in which these results generalize, or fail to generalize, to other classes of subsets of Polish spaces.  Analytic and coanalytic sets  Just beyond the Borel sets in complexity are the analytic sets and coanalytic sets. A subset of a Polish space X is analytic if it is the continuous image of a Borel subset of some other Polish space. Although any continuous preimage of a Borel set is Borel, not all analytic sets are Borel sets. A set is coanalytic if its complement is analytic.  Projective sets and Wadge degrees  Many questions in descriptive set theory ultimately depend upon set-theoretic considerations and the properties of ordinal and cardinal numbers. This phenomenon is particularly apparent in the projective sets. These are defined via the projective hierarchy on a Polish space X: * A set is declared to be \\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma}^1_1 if it is analytic. * A set is \\\\mathbf{\\\\Pi}^1_1 if it is coanalytic. * A set A is \\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma}^1_{n+1} if there is a \\\\mathbf{\\\\Pi}^1_n subset B of X \\\\times X such that A is the projection of B to the first coordinate. * A set A is \\\\mathbf{\\\\Pi}^1_{n+1} if there is a \\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma}^1_n subset B of X \\\\times X such that A is the projection of B to the first coordinate. * A set is \\\\mathbf{\\\\Delta}^1_{n} if it is both \\\\mathbf{\\\\Pi}^1_n and \\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma}^1_n . As with the Borel hierarchy, for each n, any \\\\mathbf{\\\\Delta}^1_n set is both \\\\mathbf{\\\\Sigma}^1_{n+1} and \\\\mathbf{\\\\Pi}^1_{n+1}. The properties of the projective sets are not completely determined by ZFC. Under the assumption V = L, not all projective sets have the perfect set property or the property of Baire. However, under the assumption of projective determinacy, all projective sets have both the perfect set property and the property of Baire. This is related to the fact that ZFC proves Borel determinacy, but not projective determinacy. More generally, the entire collection of sets of elements of a Polish space X can be grouped into equivalence classes, known as Wadge degrees, that generalize the projective hierarchy. These degrees are ordered in the Wadge hierarchy. The axiom of determinacy implies that the Wadge hierarchy on any Polish space is well-founded and of length Œò, with structure extending the projective hierarchy.  Borel equivalence relations  A contemporary area of research in descriptive set theory studies Borel equivalence relations. A Borel equivalence relation on a Polish space X is a Borel subset of X \\\\times X that is an equivalence relation on X.  Effective descriptive set theory  The area of effective descriptive set theory combines the methods of descriptive set theory with those of generalized recursion theory (especially hyperarithmetical theory). In particular, it focuses on lightface analogues of hierarchies of classical descriptive set theory. Thus the hyperarithmetic hierarchy is studied instead of the Borel hierarchy, and the analytical hierarchy instead of the projective hierarchy. This research is related to weaker versions of set theory such as Kripke‚ÄìPlatek set theory and second- order arithmetic.

Giaever's share of the prize was specifically for his \\"experimental discoveries regarding tunnelling phenomena in superconductors\\". Giaever is a professor emeritus at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the president of the company Applied Biophysics.  Early life  Giaever earned a degree in mechanical engineering from the Norwegian Institute of Technology in Trondheim in 1952. In 1954, he emigrated from Norway to Canada, where he was employed by the Canadian division of General Electric. He moved to the United States four years later, joining General Electric's Corporate Research and Development Center in Schenectady, New York, in 1958. He has lived in Niskayuna, New York, since then, taking up US citizenship in 1964. While working for General Electric, Giaever earned a Ph.D. degree at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1964.  The Nobel Prize  The work that led to Giaever's Nobel Prize was performed at General Electric in 1960. Following on Esaki's discovery of electron tunnelling in semiconductors in 1958, Giaever showed that tunnelling also took place in superconductors, demonstrating tunnelling through a very thin layer of oxide surrounded on both sides by metal in a superconducting or normal state. Giaever's experiments demonstrated the existence of an energy gap in superconductors, one of the most important predictions of the BCS theory of superconductivity, which had been developed in 1957.Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1972 for this theoretical advance, which bears their initials. Giaever's experimental demonstration of tunnelling in superconductors stimulated the theoretical physicist Brian Josephson to work on the phenomenon, leading to his prediction of the Josephson effect in 1962. Esaki and Giaever shared half of the 1973 Nobel Prize, and Josephson received the other half. Giaever's research later in his career was mainly in the field of biophysics. In 1969, he researched biophysics for a year as a fellow at Clare Hall, University of Cambridge, through a Guggenheim Fellowship, and he continued to work in this area after he returned to the US. He has co-signed a letter from over 70 Nobel laureate scientists to the Louisiana Legislature supporting the repeal of Louisiana‚Äôs Louisiana Science Education Act.Nobel Laureate Letter  Other prizes  In addition to the Nobel Prize, he has also been awarded the Oliver E. Buckley Prize by the American Physical Society in 1965, the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1966, and the Zworykin Award by the National Academy of Engineering in 1974. In 1985, he was awarded an honorary degree, doctor honoris causa, at the Norwegian Institute of Technology, later part of Norwegian University of Science and Technology. He is a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.  Global warming  Giaever has repeatedly professed skepticism of global warming, calling it a \\"new religion.\\" On 13 September 2011, Giaever resigned from the American Physical Society over its official position. The APS Fellow noted: \\"In the APS it is ok to discuss whether the mass of the proton changes over time and how a multi-universe behaves, but the evidence of global warming is incontrovertible?\\" Giaever is currently a science advisor with American conservative and libertarian think tank The Heartland Institute. Personal life Giaever married his childhood sweetheart Inger Skramstad in 1952. They have four children: John, Anne, Guri and Trine. Giaever is an atheist.

Polish spaces are so named because they were first extensively studied by Polish topologists and logicians‚ÄîSierpi≈Ñski, Kuratowski, Tarski and others. However, Polish spaces are mostly studied today because they are the primary setting for descriptive set theory, including the study of Borel equivalence relations. Polish spaces are also a convenient setting for more advanced measure theory, in particular in probability theory. Common examples of Polish spaces are the real line, any separable Banach space, the Cantor space, and the Baire space. Additionally, some spaces that are not complete metric spaces in the usual metric may be Polish; e.g., the open interval (0, 1) is Polish. Between any two uncountable Polish spaces, there is a Borel isomorphism; that is, a bijection that preserves the Borel structure. In particular, every uncountable Polish space has the cardinality of the continuum. Lusin spaces, Suslin spaces, and Radon spaces are generalizations of Polish spaces. Properties # Every Polish space is second countable (by virtue of being separable metrizable). # (Alexandrov's theorem) If is Polish then so is any subset of . # A subspace of a Polish space is Polish if and only if is the intersection of a sequence of open subsets of . (This is the converse to Alexandrov's theorem.) # (Cantor‚ÄìBendixson theorem) If is Polish then any closed subset of can be written as the disjoint union of a perfect set and a countable set. Further, if the Polish space is uncountable, it can be written as the disjoint union of a perfect set and a countable open set. # Every Polish space is homeomorphic to a -subset of the Hilbert cube (that is, of , where is the unit interval and is the set of natural numbers). The following spaces are Polish: * closed subsets of a Polish space, * open subsets of a Polish space, * products and disjoint unions of countable families of Polish spaces, * locally compact spaces that are metrizable and countable at infinity, * countable intersections of Polish subspaces of a Hausdorff topological space, * the set of irrational numbers with the topology induced by the standard topology of the real line. Characterization There are numerous characterizations that tell when a second-countable topological space is metrizable, such as Urysohn's metrization theorem. The problem of determining whether a metrizable space is completely metrizable is more difficult. Topological spaces such as the open unit interval (0,1) can be given both complete metrics and incomplete metrics generating their topology. There is a characterization of complete separable metric spaces in terms of a game known as the strong Choquet game. A separable metric space is completely metrizable if and only if the second player has a winning strategy in this game. A second characterization follows from Alexandrov's theorem. It states that a separable metric space is completely metrizable if and only if it is a G_\\\\delta subset of its completion in the original metric. Polish metric spaces Although Polish spaces are metrizable, they are not in and of themselves metric spaces; each Polish space admits many complete metrics giving rise to the same topology, but no one of these is singled out or distinguished. A Polish space with a distinguished complete metric is called a Polish metric space. An alternative approach, equivalent to the one given here, is first to define \\"Polish metric space\\" to mean \\"complete separable metric space\\", and then to define a \\"Polish space\\" as the topological space obtained from a Polish metric space by forgetting the metric. Generalizations of Polish spaces =Lusin spaces= A topological space is a Lusin space if it is homeomorphic to a Borel subset of a compact metric space. Some stronger topology makes a Lusin into a Polish space. There are many ways to form Lusin spaces. In particular: *Every Polish space is Lusin *A subspace of a Lusin space is Lusin if and only if it is a Borel set., Corollary 2 of Theorem 5. *Any countable union or intersection of Lusin subspaces of a Hausdorff space is Lusin., Lemma 4 and Corollary 1 of Theorem 5. *The product of a countable number of Lusin spaces is Lusin., Lemma 6. *The disjoint union of a countable number of Lusin spaces is Lusin., Corollary of Lemma 5. =Suslin spaces= A Suslin space is the image of a Polish space under a continuous mapping. So every Lusin space is Suslin. In a Polish space, a subset is a Suslin space if and only if it is a Suslin set (an image of the Suslin operation). The following are Suslin spaces: * closed or open subsets of a Suslin space, * countable products and disjoint unions of Suslin spaces, * countable intersections or countable unions of Suslin subspaces of a Hausdorff topological space, * continuous images of Suslin spaces, * Borel subsets of a Suslin space. They have the following properties: * Every Suslin space is separable. =Radon spaces= A Radon space, named after Johann Radon, is a topological space such that every Borel probability measure on M is inner regular. Since a probability measure is globally finite, and hence a locally finite measure, every probability measure on a Radon space is also a Radon measure. In particular a separable complete metric space (M, d) is a Radon space. Every Suslin space is Radon. =Polish groups= A Polish group is a topological group G that is also a Polish space, in other words homeomorphic to a separable complete metric space. There are several classic results of Banach, Freudenthal and Kuratowski on homomorphisms between Polish groups., Proposition 5 Firstly, the argument of applies mutatis mutandi to non-Abelian Polish groups: if and are separable metric spaces with Polish, then any Borel homomorphism from to is continuous. Secondly, there is a version of the open mapping theorem or the closed graph theorem due to : a continuous injective homomorphism of a Polish subgroup onto another Polish group is an open mapping. As a result, it is a remarkable fact about Polish groups that Baire-measurable mappings (i.e., for which the preimage of any open set has the property of Baire) that are homomorphisms between them are automatically continuous. The group of homeomorphisms of the Hilbert cube [0,1]N is a universal Polish group, in the sense that every Polish group is isomorphic to a closed subgroup of it. Examples: *All finite dimensional Lie groups with a countable number of components are Polish groups. *The unitary group of a separable Hilbert space (with the strong operator topology) is a Polish group. *The group of homeomorphisms of a compact metric space is a Polish group. *The product of a countable number of Polish groups is a Polish group. *The group of isometries of a separable complete metric space is a Polish group See also * Standard Borel space Notes References    Further reading  Category:Descriptive set theory Category:General topology Category:Science and technology in Poland ","title":"Polish space"},{"id":"396631","text":"Brian David Josephson (born 4 January 1940) is a Welsh theoretical physicist and professor emeritus of physics at the University of Cambridge.\\"Emeritus Faculty Staff List\\" , Department of Physics, Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge.

Josephson was known at Cambridge as a brilliant, but shy, student. Physicist John Waldram recalled overhearing Nicholas Kurti, an examiner from Oxford, discuss Josephson's exam results with David Shoenberg, reader in physics at Cambridge, and asking: \\"Who is this chap Josephson?

While still an undergraduate, he published a paper on the M√∂ssbauer effect, pointing out a crucial issue other researchers had overlooked. According to one eminent physicist speaking to Physics World, Josephson wrote several papers important enough to assure him a place in the history of physics even without his discovery of the Josephson effect.Edwin Cartlidge, \\"Pioneer of the Paranormal\\", Physics World, May 2002.

For the thesis, Brian Josephson, \\"Non-linear conduction in superconductors\\", Newton Library Catalogue, University of Cambridge. =Discovery of the Josephson effect= Josephson was 22 years old when he did the work on quantum tunnelling that won him the Nobel Prize. He discovered that a supercurrent could tunnel through a thin barrier, predicting, according to physicist Andrew Whitaker, that \\"at a junction of two superconductors, a current will flow even if there is no drop in voltage; that when there is a voltage drop, the current should oscillate at a frequency related to the drop in voltage; and that there is a dependence on any magnetic field.\\"Andrew Whitaker, The New Quantum Age: From Bell's Theorem to Quantum Computation and Teleportation, Oxford University Press, 2012, p. 273.

Before Anderson and Rowell confirmed the calculations, the American physicist John Bardeen, who had shared the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics (and who shared it again in 1972), objected to Josephson's work. He submitted an article to Physical Review Letters on 25 July 1962, arguing that \\"there can be no such superfluid flow.\\" The disagreement led to a confrontation in September that year at Queen Mary College, London, at the Eighth International Conference on Low Temperature Physics. When Bardeen (then one of the most eminent physicists in the world) began speaking, Josephson (still a student) stood up and interrupted him. The men exchanged views, reportedly in a civil and soft-spoken manner.Donald G. McDonald, \\"The Nobel Laureate Versus the Graduate Student\\", Physics Today, July 2001, pp. 46‚Äì51. Also see Donald G. McDonald, \\"History of the Josephson Effect\\" (lecture), IEEE.TV.

Josephson\\", in Lundqvist 1992. Parapsychology =Early interest and Transcendental Meditation= Josephson became a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge in 1962. Josephson became interested in philosophy of mind in the late sixties and, in particular, in the mind‚Äìbody problem, and is one of the few scientists to argue that parapsychological phenomena (telepathy, psychokinesis and other paranormal themes) may be real.Alison George, \\"Lone voices special: Take nobody's word for it\\", New Scientist, 9 December 2006 (pp. 56‚Äì57), p. 56. In 1971, he began practising Transcendental Meditation (TM), which had been taken up by several celebrities, including the Beatles.Bob Oates, Celebrating the Dawn: Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and the TM technique, Putnam, 1976, p. 204; Emily J. McMurray, Jane Kelly Kosek, and Roger M. Valade, Notable Twentieth-Century Scientists, Gale Research, 1995, p. 1044. For celebrities and TM, Lola Williamson, Transcendent in America, NYU Press, 2010, p. 93. Winning the Nobel Prize in 1973 gave him the freedom to work in less orthodox areas, and he became increasingly involved ‚Äì including during science conferences, to the irritation of fellow scientists ‚Äì in talking about meditation, telepathy and higher states of consciousness.Eliot Marshall, \\"For Winners, a New Life of Opportunity ‚Äì and Perils\\", Science, 294(5541), 12 October 2001 (pp. 293, 295), p. 295. In 1974, he angered scientists during a colloquium of molecular and cellular biologists in Versailles by inviting them to read the Bhagavad Gita (5th ‚Äì 2nd century BCE) and the work of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the founder of the TM movement, and by arguing about special states of consciousness achieved through meditation. \\"Nothing forces us,\\" one scientist shouted at him, \\"to listen to your wild speculations.\\" Biophysicist Henri Atlan wrote that the session ended in uproar.Henri Atlan, Enlightenment to Enlightenment: Intercritique of Science and Myth, SUNY Press, 1993, pp. 20‚Äì21. In May that year, Josephson addressed a symposium held to welcome the Maharishi to Cambridge.\\"Josephson on transcendental meditation,\\" New Scientist, 16 May 1974, p. 416; Stuart Halperin, \\"The birth of Creative Intelligence,\\" New Scientist, 23 May 1974, p. 459. The following month, at the first Canadian conference on psychokinesis, he was one of 21 scientists who tested claims by Matthew Manning, a Cambridgeshire teenager who said he had psychokinetic abilities; Josephson apparently told a reporter that he believed Manning's powers were a new kind of energy.David F. Marks, The Psychology of the Psychic, Prometheus Books, 2000, p. 200. A. R. G. Owen; J. L. Whitton, \\"Report on Demonstration and Experiments performed during the Conference\\", Proceedings of the First Canadian Conference on Psychokinesis, New Horizons, 1(5), January 1975, p. 191ff. He later withdrew or corrected the statement.Matthew Manning, One Foot in the Stars, Thorsons, 1999, pp. 60‚Äì61. Josephson said that Trinity College's tradition of interest in the paranormal meant that he did not dismiss these ideas out of hand.Josephson 2005, p. 1. Several presidents of the Society for Psychical Research had been fellows of Trinity, and the Perrott-Warrick Fund, set up in Trinity in 1937 to fund parapsychology research, is still administered by the college.Former presidents of the Society who were fellows or members of Trinity include Henry Sidgwick (1838‚Äì1900); John William Strutt (1842‚Äì1919), Cavendish Professor of Physics and winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1904; F. W. H. Myers (1843‚Äì1901); Edmund Gurney (1847‚Äì1888); Arthur Balfour (1848‚Äì1930), who became prime minister; his brother Gerald Balfour (1853‚Äì1945); and C. D. Broad (1887‚Äì1971), Knightbridge Professor of Moral Philosophy. Wendy E.

Also see Bruce Schechter, The Path of No Resistance: The Story of the Revolution in Superconductivity, Simon & Schuster, 1989, p. 163. Josephson argued that meditation could lead to mystical and scientific insights, and that, as a result of it, he had come to believe in a creator.For mystical and scientific insights, Paul Davies, The Mind of God, Simon & Schuster, 1993, p. 227. For belief in a creator, Brian Josephson, \\"There Need Be No Ultimate Conflict Between Science and Religion,\\" in Henry Margenau and Roy Abraham Varghese (eds.), Cosmos, Bios, Theos, Open Court Publishing, 1992, p. 50. =Fundamental Fysiks Group= The Cavendish Laboratory unveiled a plaque on the Mond Building in November 2012 dedicated to the discovery of the Josephson effect. Josephson became involved in the mid-1970s with a group of physicists associated with the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley, who were investigating paranormal claims. They had organized themselves loosely into the Fundamental Fysiks Group, and had effectively become the Stanford Research Institute's (SRI) \\"house theorists,\\" according to historian of science David Kaiser. Core members in the group were Elizabeth Rauscher, George Weissmann, John Clauser, Jack Sarfatti, Saul-Paul Sirag, Nick Herbert, Fred Alan Wolf, Fritjof Capra, Henry Stapp, Philippe Eberhard and Gary Zukav. David Kaiser, \\"How the Hippies Saved Physics\\", MIT School of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences, 2010, from 20:00 mins; for house theorists, from 23:20 mins. There was significant government interest at the time in quantum mechanics ‚Äì the American government was financing research at SRI into telepathy ‚Äì and physicists able to understand it found themselves in demand. The Fundamental Fysiks Group used ideas from quantum physics, particularly Bell's theorem and quantum entanglement, to explore issues such as action at a distance, clairvoyance, precognition, remote viewing and psychokinesis.Kaiser 2010, from 20:00 mins. In 1976, Josephson travelled to California at the invitation of one of the Fundamental Fysiks Group members, Jack Sarfatti, who introduced him to others including laser physicists Russell Targ and Harold Puthoff, and quantum physicist Henry Stapp. The San Francisco Chronicle covered Josephson's visit.David Kaiser, How the Hippies Saved Physics: Science, Counterculture, and the Quantum Revival, W.

Ramachandran (eds.), Consciousness and the Physical World, Pergamon Press, 1980. with neuroscientist V. S. Ramachandran. A conference on \\"Science and Consciousness\\" followed a year later in Cordoba, Spain, attended by physicists and Jungian psychoanalysts, and addressed by Josephson, Fritjof Capra and David Bohm (1917‚Äì1992).Yasuo Yuasa, Overcoming Modernity: Synchronicity and Image-Thinking, SUNY Press, 2009, p. 179.

By 1996, he had set up the Mind‚ÄìMatter Unification Project at the Cavendish Laboratory to explore intelligent processes in nature.Matthew Segall, \\"Mind Matter Unification/The Foundations of Quantum Mechanics\\", Theory of Condensed Matter group, Cavendish Laboratory, 26 March 1996. Brian Josephson, \\"Mind‚ÄìMatter Unification Project\\", Cavendish Laboratory, 27 April 1997. Brian Josephson, Homepage, Cavendish Laboratory. In 2002, he told Physics World: \\"Future science will consider quantum mechanics as the phenomenology of particular kinds of organised complex system. Quantum entanglement would be one manifestation of such organisation, paranormal phenomena another.\\" =Reception and views on the scientific community= Josephson delivered the Pollock Memorial Lecture in 2006, the Hermann Staudinger Lecture in 2009 and the Sir Nevill Mott Lecture in 2010.\\"The Pollock Memorial Lecture\\" , The Royal Society of New South Wales and the University of Sydney; \\"4th Hermann Staudinger Lecture with Nobel Laureate Brian D. Josephson, 28 October 2009\\", Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies; \\"2010 Professor Brian Josephson: Which way for Physics?\\" , Loughborough University. Josephson on a Cambridge Wikimedia walk in September 2014 Matthew Reisz wrote in Times Higher Education in 2010 that Josephson has long been one of physics' \\"more colourful figures.\\"Matthew Reisz, \\"He didn't see that coming, or did he?\\", Times Higher Education, 19 April 2010. Also see Mark Jackson, \\"The not-so-noble past of the Nobel Prizes\\", The Conversation, 6 October 2013. His support for unorthodox causes has attracted criticism from fellow scientists since the 1970s, including from Philip Anderson.Burton Feldman, The Nobel Prize: A History of Genius, Controversy, and Prestige, Arcade Publishing, 2001, p. 199; also see Robert L. Park, Superstition: Belief in the Age of Science, Princeton University Press, 2009, p. 156. Josephson regards the criticism as prejudice, and believes that it has served to deprive him of an academic support network.Alison George (New Scientist) 2006, p. 57. He has repeatedly criticized \\"science by consensus,\\" arguing that the scientific community is too quick to reject certain kinds of ideas. \\"Anything goes among the physics community ‚Äì cosmic wormholes, time travel,\\" he argues, \\"just so long as it keeps its distance from anything mystical or New Age-ish.\\" Referring to this position as \\"pathological disbelief,\\" he holds it responsible for the rejection by academic journals of papers on the paranormal.Alison George (New Scientist) 2006, p. 56; Brian Josephson, \\"Pathological Disbelief\\"], lecture, Nobel Laureates' meeting, Lindau, 30 June 2004. He has compared parapsychology to the theory of continental drift, proposed in 1912 by Alfred Wegener (1880‚Äì1930) to explain observations that were otherwise inexplicable, which was resisted and ridiculed until evidence led to its acceptance after Wegener's death.Josephson 2005, pp. 1‚Äì2; for Wegener, also see J. W. Grove, \\"Rationality at Risk: Science against Pseudoscience\\", Minerva, 23(2), June 1985 (pp. 216‚Äì240), p. 218. Science writer Martin Gardner criticized Josephson in 1980 for complaining to The New York Review of Books, along with three other physicists, about an article by J. A. Wheeler that ridiculed parapsychology.Olivier Costa de Beauregard, Richard D. Mattuck, Brian D. Josephson and Evan Harris Walker, \\"Parapsychology: An Exchange\\", New York Review of Books, 27, 26 June 1980, pp. 48‚Äì51. The other three physicists were Evan Harris Walker (1935‚Äì2006), Olivier Costa de Beauregard (1911‚Äì2007) and Richard D. Mattuck. Several physicists complained in 2001 when, in a Royal Mail booklet celebrating the Nobel Prize's centenary, Josephson wrote that Britain was at the forefront of research into telepathy.Brian Josephson, \\"Physics and the Nobel Prizes\\", Royal Mail, 2001: \\"Physicists attempt to reduce the complexity of nature to a single unifying theory, of which the most successful and universal, the quantum theory, has been associated with several Nobel prizes, for example those to Dirac and Heisenberg. Max Planck's original attempts a hundred years ago to explain the precise amount of energy radiated by hot bodies began a process of capturing in mathematical form a mysterious, elusive world containing 'spooky interactions at a distance', real enough however to lead to inventions such as the laser and transistor. \\"Quantum theory is now being fruitfully combined with theories of information and computation. These developments may lead to an explanation of processes still not understood within conventional science such as telepathy, an area where Britain is at the forefront of research. Physicist David Deutsch said the Royal Mail had \\"let itself be hoodwinked\\" into supporting nonsense, although another physicist, Robert Matthews, suggested that Deutsch was skating on thin ice given the latter's own work on parallel universes and time travel. In 2004, Josephson criticized an experiment by the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry to test claims by Russian schoolgirl Natasha Demkina that she could see inside people's bodies using a special kind of vision. The experiment involved her being asked to match six people to their confirmed medical conditions (plus one with none); to pass the test she had to make five correct matches, but made only four.\\"Body Shock: The Girl With X-Ray Eyes\\", Discovery Channel, 2004 (for a display from Demkina's perspective, see part 2, from 04:00 mins; for the second, more controlled, experiment, part 2, from 10:30 mins and part 3). Andrew A. Skolnick, \\"Natasha Demkina: The Girl with Very Normal Eyes\\", LiveScience, 28 January 2005. Josephson argued that this was statistically significant, and that the experiment had set her up to fail. One of the researchers, Richard Wiseman, professor of psychology at the University of Hertfordshire, responded that Josephson had no record of publishing on parapsychology.Phil Baty, \\"Scientists fail to see eye to eye over girl's 'X-ray vision'\\", Times Higher Education, 10 December 2004. Brian Josephson, \\"Scientists' unethical use of media for propaganda purposes\\", Cavendish Laboratory, 2004. Brian Josephson, \\"Distorted visions 2\\", Times Higher Education, 17 December 2004. Also see Rupert Sheldrake, \\"Distorted visions 1\\", Times Higher Education, 17 December 2004. Keith Rennolis, professor of applied statistics at the University of Greenwich, supported Josephson's position, asserting that the experiment was \\"woefully inadequate\\" to determine any effect.Keith Rennolls, \\"Distorted visions 3\\", Times Higher Education, 17 December 2004. Josephson's reputation for promoting unorthodox causes was cemented by his support for the ideas of water memory and cold fusion, both of which are rejected by mainstream scientists. Water memory is by some purported to provide a possible explanation for homeopathy; it is dismissed by many scientists as pseudoscience, although Josephson has expressed support for it since attending a conference at which French immunologist Jacques Benveniste first proposed it.George (New Scientist) 2006, p. 56. Brian Josephson, \\"Molecule memories\\", letters, New Scientist, 1 November 1997. Brian Josephson, \\"Molecular memory\\", The Independent, 22 March 1999. Dana Ullman, The Homeopathic Revolution, North Atlantic Books, 2007, p. 130ff. Cold fusion is the hypothesis that nuclear reactions can occur at room temperature. When Martin Fleischmann, the British chemist who pioneered research into it, died in 2012, Josephson wrote a supportive obituary in the Guardian and complained to Nature that its obituary had failed to give Fleischmann due credit.Brian Josephson, \\"Martin Fleischmann obituary\\", The Guardian, 31 August 2012. Brian Josephson, \\"Fleischmann denied due credit\\", Nature, 490, 4 October 2012, p. 37 (also available here). For background on cold fusion, see Thomas F. Gieryn, Cultural Boundaries of Science: Credibility on the Line, University of Chicago Press, 1999, pp. 183‚Äì232. Antony Valentini of Imperial College London withdrew Josephson's invitation to a 2010 conference on the de Broglie-Bohm theory because of his work on the paranormal, although it was reinstated after complaints.Reisz (Times Higher Education), 19 April 2010.

Their purpose was to draw the large French-speaking population to the American revolutionary cause. This goal ultimately failed, and Quebec, along with the other northern provinces of British America, remained loyal to Britain. The only significant assistance that was gained was the recruitment of two regiments totalling not more than 1,000 men. The cover sheet to the French translation of the letter drafted by the First Continental Congress in 1774 Background The acquisition of the Province of Quebec as a result of the French and Indian War (1754‚Äì1763)\\"French and Indian War.\\" Dictionary of American History. 7 vols. Charles Scribner's Sons, 1976. Reproduced in History Resource Center. Farmington Hills, MI: Gale Group. gave Great Britain control over the entire eastern seaboard of North America, and brought the former French colony of Canada into a closer relationship with the American colonies. The new province was significantly different than the other provinces of British America, as the vast majority of people in Quebec spoke only French and were Roman Catholic.Wrong, p. 19 There were also differences in civic and legal affairs, as the law had, prior to the British conquest, been based on French law. In 1774, the British Parliament enacted the Quebec Act, along with other legislation that was labeled by American colonists as the Intolerable Acts. This measure, which replaced the Royal Proclamation of 1763 as the governing document of Quebec, was used to fortify the position of the British in Quebec by guaranteeing (among other things) the rights of French Canadians to practice Roman Catholicism. It is largely perceived by historians to be damage control in the province of Quebec, in order to prevent the French Canadians from joining the independence movement in the American colonies.\\"Quebec Act of 1774.\\" Gale Encyclopedia of U.S. Economic History. Gale Group, 1999. Reproduced in History Resource Center. Farmington Hills, MI: Gale Group. The American colonists interpreted the religious provisions concerning Catholicism as a wedge by which Catholicism might be introduced into all of the colonies, and other provisions concerning the structure of the Quebec government to be an attempt by the British Parliament to assert more control over the province, and deny its people what many considered to be basic rights. First letter =Congress drafts the letter= John Dickinson, author of the first letter On October 21, 1774, the First Continental Congress, meeting to craft a united response to the Intolerable Acts, resolved to address letters to the populations of Quebec, St. John's Island, Nova Scotia, Georgia, East Florida and West Florida, all being colonies that were not represented by delegates in the Congress.Monette, Pierre (2007). Rendez-vous manqu√© avec la r√©volution am√©ricaine., Montr√©al: Qu√©bec Am√©rique, page 59.Frothingham, pp. 375‚Äì376 A committee composed of Thomas Cushing, Richard Henry Lee and John Dickinson was set up to draft those letters.Monette, page 60. A first draft was presented on October 24, debated and returned to the committee. On October 26, a new draft was presented, debated, amended and adopted. A resolution was passed for the president to sign the letter and ordering the translation and printing of a Letter to the Inhabitants of the Province of Quebec to be done under the supervision of the delegates of Pennsylvania. The letter was translated to French and printed as an 18-page brochure entitled Lettre adress√©e aux habitans de la Province de Qu√©bec, ci-devant le Canada, de la part du Congr√®s g√©n√©ral de l'Am√©rique Septentrionale, tenu √† Philadelphie.Literally: \\"Letter addressed to the Inhabitants of the Province of Quebec, formerly Canada, from the General Congress of Septentrional America, held in Philadelphia.\\" The translation is attributed to Pierre Eugene du Simitiere. The final content of the letter is attributed to John Dickinson, as a draft in his own hand very closely resembles the final letter.Monette, page 61. =Contents of the first letter= The letter informed the people of Quebec of five important rights of British constitutional law which were not in force in their colony over a decade after the peace treaty of 1763, which ended the French and Indian War, and resulted in every French subject in Canada becoming a new British subject, theoretically equal in rights to all other British subjects. These five rights were representative government, trial by jury, Habeas Corpus, land ownership, and freedom of the press. The text quotes a passage of Beccaria's On Crimes and Punishment and multiple excerpts of Montesquieu's The Spirit of Laws. Quebec historian Marcel Trudel believes this first letter to have been \\"a crash course on democratic government\\", while Gustave Lanct√¥t claims that the Congress' letter \\"introduced [among the inhabitants] the notion of personal liberty and political equality.\\", calling it their first \\"political alphabet\\" and \\"first lesson in constitutional law\\".Monette, page 73. The people of Quebec were invited to give themselves the provincial representation the Quebec Act did not provide for, and have this representative body send delegates to the upcoming continental Congress, to be held in Philadelphia on May 10, 1775. =Distribution and reaction to the first letter= The French- born Philadelphia printer Fleury Mesplet printed 2,000 copies of the French translation.Monette, page 85. Other manuscript French translations of the original English letter (first published in Dunlap's Pennsylvania Packet) were in circulation as well, possibly even arriving in Canada before the \\"official\\" translation paid by the Congress.Monette, page 99.\\"Letter from Montreal. Parties in Canada\\", in American Archives series 4, volume 1, p. 1164\\"Letters from Quebeck, giving an account of the treatment of Mr. Walker\\", in American Archives series 4, volume 3, p. 1185 Wide circulation of the letter was prevented by General Guy Carleton, then Governor of the province. However, he reported to his superiors in England that, \\"a report was spread that at Montreal that letters of importance had been received from the General Congress,\\" and that town meetings were being held, \\"breathing that same spirit, so plentifully gone forth through the neighbouring Provinces.\\"Coffin, p. 483 These town meetings, seemingly dominated by English-speakers, ended without the election of delegates to the Continental Congress. In early 1775, Boston's Committee of Correspondence sent John Brown into Quebec to gather intelligence, gauge sentiment, and agitate for rebellion in that province. He found mixed sentiment among English-speaking inhabitants, some of whom were concerned that the Congress' adoption of an export boycott would essentially give the lucrative fur trade to French-speakers. The bulk of the French- speaking population was at best neutral with respect to British rule; some were happy with it, but more might be convinced to assist the Americans in their aims. Brown also noted the relatively weak military presence in the province.Alden, pp. 195‚Äì196 General Carleton, while aware of Brown's activities, did nothing to interfere, beyond preventing publication of the letter in the local newspaper.Nelson, p. 59 Second letter John Jay, author of the second letter =Drafting the second letter= The Second Continental Congress met on May 10, 1775, following the Battles of Lexington and Concord in which colonial forces resisted a large British force on April 19 and drove it back to Boston. This victory resulted in Congress opening the session with great excitement and hope.Wrong, pp. 272‚Äì273 John Brown arrived in Philadelphia on May 17 to report the capture of Fort Ticonderoga and the raid on Fort Saint-Jean, an event that stimulated much discussion in the Congress. On May 26, the Congress resolved to draft a second letter to the inhabitants of Canada. The committee that drafted the letter was composed of John Jay, Silas Deane and Samuel Adams, the last having previously written a letter to the people of Canada on behalf of the Boston Committee of Correspondence.Monette, page 110. On May 29, after having heard additional testimony on the situation in Montreal from James Price, a Montreal merchant, the Second Continental Congress approved the letter.Lanctot, pp. 46‚Äì47 The letter, entitled Letter to the oppressed inhabitants of Canada, was translated as Literally: Letter addressed to the oppressed inhabitants of the province of Quebec, from the General Congress of North America, held in Philadelphia. The letter was signed by president John Hancock, and again translated by Pierre Eug√®ne du Simiti√®re; 1,000 copies of it were printed by Fleury Mesplet.Monette, page 162. The content of the letter has been attributed to John Jay. =Contents of the second letter= In the letter, the Congress again deplored the form of the civil government introduced by the Quebec Act, which it likened to \\"tyranny\\". It further asserted that under this form of government \\"you and your wives and your children are made slaves.\\" As for the enjoyment of their religion, the Congress believed it uncertain for it depended on \\"a legislature in which you have no share, and over which you have no controul\\". The Congress was clearly hoping to draw French-speaking habitants to their cause, as well as English-speaking residents that had migrated to Quebec from the other colonies.Rideau, p. 75 At the time of the letter's writing, the Congress was already aware that Governor Carleton had called the people to arm themselves to defend their new King from the invasion. The letter warned the population of the danger of being sent to fight against France were it to join the war on the side of the Americans (which it eventually did in 1778). If the Congress insisted again on treating the Canadians as friends sharing common interests with the other colonists, it however warned the people not to \\"reduce us the disagreeable necessity of treating you as enemies.\\" =Distribution and reaction to the second letter= Price took the letter to Montreal, along with a similar letter from the New York Provincial Congress,Lanctot, pp. 48‚Äì49 and circulated them in the province. Much of the English-speaking merchant class, which was dependent on the fur trade and the market for it in Europe, was wary of the situation. The French habitants were generally unswayed by appeals to English liberties, with which they had relatively little familiarity. However, they were also not overly supportive of the existing military government, as calls to arms were met with limited success. The habitants much more opportunistically were happy to follow whichever force was winning at the time, as long as they paid for their supplies.Rideau, p. 76 In the end, the Americans gained limited support in Quebec, ultimately raising two regiments that participated in the Continental Army. The 1st Canadian Regiment was raised in November 1775 during the early days of the invasion of Canada, and the 2nd Canadian Regiment was raised in January 1776. Third letter James Wilson, one of the authors of the third letter In September 1775, after the failure of the second letter to sway public opinion, the American Colonists launched an invasion of Quebec from Fort Ticonderoga and Cambridge, Massachusetts. This invasion culminated in the Battle of Quebec at the end of December 1775, in which the city was successfully defended, and the invaders dug in for the winter. Following the battle, Moses Hazen and Edward Antill traveled from Quebec to Philadelphia to bring the news of the American defeat. =Drafting the third letter= After hearing of the defeat, the Congress, on January 23, 1776, set up a committee to which was entrusted the drafting of another letter to the Canadian population. The members of the committee this time were William Livingston, Thomas Lynch Jr, and James Wilson.Monette, page 307. The letter was approved the day after, and signed by John Hancock. =Contents= The Congress thanked the population for the services it rendered to its cause and ensured them that troops to protect them were on the way, and would arrive before British reinforcements. It also informed them that the Congress had authorized the raising of two battalions in Canada to assist in the cause. The people were once again invited to organize local and provincial assemblies, which could choose delegates to represent the province in the Continental Congress. =Distribution and reaction to the third letter= The French translation was again printed by Fleury Mesplet; however, it is not certain who in the committee is the author and also if du Simiti√®re was the translator.Monette, page 309. Hazen and Antill delivered copies of the letter to David Wooster, commanding the colonial forces occupying Montreal. He oversaw distribution of the letter at the end of February.Kingsford (vol 6), pp. 44‚Äì45 The letter met with no significant response, as the populace was unhappy about being paid for supplies in paper currency, and was otherwise not enamoured of the occupation by the colonial forces. Conclusion The 1775 American invasion was a disastrous failure, with the Americans forced to retreat back to Fort Ticonderoga. The province remained in British hands, and its population centers were never threatened again in the war. The goal of these letters, and a variety of other addresses to the Canadian people, to gain political and military support for the revolution were generally not realized. While the Congress succeeded in raising two regiments of Canadians (James Livingston's 1st Canadian Regiment and Hazen's 2nd Canadian Regiment), their numbers were not as large as desired, and the seigneurs and the Catholic clergy ultimately rallied around the British governor. Quebec would remain a relatively strong colony for Britain due in large part to the strict leadership of Guy Carleton,Wrong, pp. 280‚Äì290 and despite attempts to bring the revolutionary spirit of the American colonies into Quebec.Alfred Leroy Burt, The Old Province of Quebec, (Toronto: The Ryerson Press, 1933), p. 145 Contents of the letters English and French Wikisource have the contents of the letters: * Letter to the Inhabitants of the Province of Quebec, October 26, 1774 (en, fr) * Letter to the oppressed inhabitants of Canada, May 29, 1775 (en, fr) * Letter to the Inhabitants of the Province of Canada, January 24, 1776 (en, fr) Notes References   * English translation of the previous entry.  * This book gives a somewhat detailed account of the activities of the First Continental Congress.

Created by producer and writer Jon Stone, Mr. Hooper is the original proprietor of Hooper's Store, the neighborhood variety store and combination diner/corner store that serves as a place for Muppets and humans to meet and interact. Lee, a character actor and instructor who had been blacklisted during the McCarthy era, was \\"perfectly cast\\" as Mr. Hooper. Mr. Hooper ranked first of all human characters of the show in recognition by young viewers. Mr. Hooper, who has been described as \\"slightly cranky but good-hearted\\" and \\"curmudgeonly\\", bridges the gap between the older generation and its young audience. Hooper's Store, \\"an idealized social institution\\", is an extension of his personality. He had a special relationship with the Muppet Big Bird. At the time of Lee's death, instead of recasting the role, or explaining his departure by saying he had moved, quit or retired, the writers and producers of Sesame Street decided to create an episode that taught their young audience about the difficult topic of death. Research was conducted to ascertain the messages they wanted to convey about the topic, as well as the effect the episode would have on the young children who watched it. They were advised by experts in the fields of child psychology, child development, and religion. Studies conducted after the episode was produced showed that most children understood its messages about death, and that they experienced no long-term ill effects. The episode, written by head writer Norman Stiles, aired on Thanksgiving Day 1983; the cast and crew reported that filming it was an emotional and touching experience. The episode, which set the standard for dealing with difficult topics on children's television, was called heartbreaking yet affirming, and one of the proudest moments in the show's history.  Development and description  Mr. Hooper, played by Will Lee from the premiere of Sesame Street in 1969 until his death in 1982, was one of the first four human characters that appeared on the show. Created by producer and writer Jon Stone, the role of Mr. Hooper was the first to be cast.Gikow, p. 68 Lee came to Stone's attention through writers Bruce Hart and Carole Hart.Davis, p. 177 Mr. Hooper was inspired by the Bob Keeshan character Captain Kangaroo; Stone previously worked on the Captain Kangaroo program, which greatly influenced him as he developed Sesame Street. Mr. Hooper is the original proprietor of Hooper's Store, the neighborhood variety store and combination diner/corner store that serves as a place for Muppets and humans to meet and interact.Gikow, p. 66 Stone's original conception of Mr. Hooper was that he would be, like most owners of such establishments at the time, older, male, and Jewish.Davis, p. 168 Lee was a character actor and acting instructor with a range of roles in the theater and who had been blacklisted during the McCarthy era. According to writer Michael Davis, Lee played Mr. Hooper, known for his bowtie and hornrimmed glasses, \\"with such certainty and naturalness he made adults suspend their sense of disbelief\\".Davis, p. 280 Writer Louise A. Gikow stated that Lee was \\"perfectly cast\\" as Mr. Hooper. According to fellow cast member Bob McGrath, who also appeared in Sesame Street's first episode with Lee, \\"Will had a broader dimension to his character than perhaps the rest of us did ... He convinced me that no matter how simple the scene was with a child, you had to bring a tremendous integrity and an honesty and credibility to it\\". Joan Ganz Cooney, Sesame Street co-creator and president of the Children's Television Workshop (CTW), said, \\"He gave millions of children the message that the old and the young have a lot to say to each other\\". The New York Times reported that Mr. Hooper ranked first of all human characters of the show in recognition by young viewers. Davis described Mr. Hooper as \\"slightly cranky but good-hearted\\". Gikow called Mr. Hooper \\"curmudgeonly\\". Davis stated that since Mr. Hooper's appearance in the first episode of Sesame Street, he had become many things to many young children, \\"... the guy in the apron at the far side of the generation gap, his half-lens glasses slipping down his nose\\". Davis also stated that Hooper's Store, which he called \\"an idealized social institution\\", is an extension of Mr. Hooper's personality. Mr. Hooper has a special relationship with the Muppet character Big Bird, who would often come into Hooper's Store for a birdseed milkshake and a chat. A running gag in the show was that Big Bird would often mispronounce Mr. Hooper's name, although most attempts ended in \\"ooper,\\" such as \\"Looper\\" or \\"Cooper\\". Mr. Hooper's first name, Harold, was not revealed until the character earned a GED during night school.Borgenicht, David (1998). Sesame Street Unpaved. New York: Hyperion Publishing. p. 124. Mr. Hooper's last appearances on Sesame Street aired in 1983, but Lee's last segments for the show were taped in November 1982. Lee participated in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade with other Sesame Street characters a few days before he died of a heart attack on December 7, 1982.Gikow, p. 182  Death of Mr. Hooper  When Will Lee died on December 7, 1982, instead of recasting the role for the character or explaining Mr. Hooper's departure by saying that he had retired or moved away, the producers of Sesame Street decided to create an episode that taught their young audience about the difficult topic of death. According to CTW researcher Rosemarie Truglio and her colleagues, the episode was one of the many social issues relevant to preschoolers the show has dealt with throughout its history.Truglio, et. al, p. 73 Executive producer Dulcy Singer reported that they followed their instincts to be \\"honest and straightforward\\" and to \\"deal with it head-on\\". = Synopsis = The Sesame Street episode (#1839) in which the death of Mr. Hooper was discussed was structured as all episodes were structured at the time, with individual segments that took place on the main brownstone set and interrupted by inserts, or puppet skits, short films, and animations.Gikow, p. 179 The episode begins with a scene between Gordon (Roscoe Orman) and the Muppet Forgetful Jones (Richard Hunt). Gordon helps Forgetful remember something that had made him happy; as Davis states, \\"Later, Big Bird forgets something that makes him sad\\". After several inserts, Big Bird walks backward with his head between his legs; when Gordon asks him why, he answers, \\"Just because\\". Later, Big Bird listens to the adults conversing about a new baby who is due to visit Sesame Street with his mother. Two segments later, Big Bird interrupts the adults‚ÄîMaria (Sonia Manzano), David (Northern Calloway), Bob (Bob McGrath), Susan (Loretta Long), Gordon, Luis (Emilio Delgado), and Olivia (Alaina Reed Hall)‚Äîdiscussing politics by giving them pictures he had drawn of each of them. He gets to Mr. Hooper's picture, saying that he would give it to him when he returns. Maria reminds Big Bird that Mr. Hooper has died and will never come back. Big Bird reacts by getting upset, expressing his confusion and sadness. The adults reassure him that they love him and will take care of him and David reveals that he would take over the store, Mr. Hooper having left it to him in his will. Big Bird asks, \\"Why does it have to be this way? Give me one good reason!\\" and Gordon answers, \\"Big Bird, it has to be this way ... just because.\\" Looking at Mr. Hooper's picture, Big Bird says, mispronouncing his name as he had done many times in the past, \\"I'm going to miss you, Mr. Looper.\\" Maria tearfully corrects Big Bird and everyone gathers around him in support. The episode ends with Big Bird hanging Mr. Hooper's picture near his nest. Luis knocks on his door to introduce the new baby, followed by the entire grown-up cast. Big Bird says, \\"You know what the nice thing is about new babies? One day they're not here, and the next day, here they are!\\" The cast collectively show affection to the baby as the show closes. = Research = Similar to what they had done with other social issues and in developing their curriculum, the CTW researched the topic of death and how preschoolers understand it. The first step in their research process was to assemble a team of experts, led by CTW research director Lewis Bernstein, in the fields of child psychology, child development, and religion. The team advised the show's writers and producers how to handle the topic, in what they called \\"a curriculum bath\\"; Bernstein described it in this way: \\"We bring in the experts to allow the writer to soak in expertise. We in Research bring in people to provide the information, and then the artistry of the writer takes over, as they integrate what they've heard\\".Davis, p. 281 The experts advised the producers to provide their viewers with a sense of closure about Mr. Hooper's death. They decided not to focus on how Mr. Hooper died, since explaining that he was old and ill might increase children's fears about death. They chose to deal with his death in a single episode, and convey simple messages like: \\"Mr. Hooper is dead; Mr. Hooper will not be coming back; and Mr. Hooper will be missed by all\\". Gikow stated that the episode they created was an example of the writers and producers' skills as educators as well as entertainers. Before the episode aired, the CTW conducted a series of studies to guide the writers and producers in creating the episode. Their goal was to answer four key questions: (1) Will children understand the messages they wanted to convey about death? (2) How attentive will they be to the storyline? (3) How will parents respond to the treatment of such a sensitive topic? and (4) Will children be disturbed by the messages, and if so, for how long? The researchers broke up children into three groups: children who only watched the scenes in which the storyline was played out and who were interviewed afterwards; children who watched the entire episode and whose attention was recorded while they viewed it; and children who watched the episode without the inserts, with their parents, who were interviewed 9 or 10 days later.Truglio, et. al, pp. 73‚Äì74 The researchers found that 73% of 4- and 5-year-olds in their study understood that Mr. Hooper was dead and that 88% of this group understood that he was not coming back, although only about one- fourth of the 3-year-old viewers responded correctly. Most of the 4- and 5-year-olds understood that Big Bird and the adults were sad. Most children (80%) were attentive during the episode. The parents interviewed had \\"overwhelmingly positive\\" reactions to the show, and that half reported that they had discussed death with their children after viewing it. None of the parents reported negative reactions from their children, either immediately after watching the episode or at a later time.Truglio, et. al, p. 74 = Development and legacy = Sesame Street head writer Norman Stiles was chosen to write the segments about Mr. Hooper's death. The episode focused on the life cycle of birth and death by also mentioning the birth of a baby, and by remembering Mr. Hooper. Stiles said, \\"We decided to say that while Mr. Hooper was not here anymore, we will always have that part of him that lives within the heart, that we have our love and that it will always stay\\". Stiles wanted to convey that expressing grief for someone who had died was difficult for both adults and children. Instead of providing an explanation, the adults of Sesame Street tell Big Bird, when he asked why Mr. Hooper had died, that there was no real reason, that it happened, as Gordon tells Big Bird, \\"Just because\\". The show's outside experts advised Stiles and the producers to remove the line because they were concerned that an open-ended explanation would not be enough for children, but Stiles kept the line because it was an acknowledgement, as Gikow stated, that there is never a good explanation about why people die.Gikow, pp. 182‚Äì183See Davis, pp. 281‚Äì285 and Gikow, pp. 182‚Äì183 for descriptions of the episode's plot. The episode aired on Thanksgiving Day 1983, a year after Lee's final appearance as Mr. Hooper at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade. The producers chose to air it the first week of the new season in order to explain Mr. Hooper's absence as soon as possible, for maximum exposure, and to ensure that parents were at home with their children in order to discuss it.Davis, p. 284 The illustrations used for the episode were drawn by Caroll Spinney, who performed Big Bird. Mr. Hooper's picture remained on the set from then on, as a continuing memorial to Lee and Mr. Hooper. Spinney, speaking of the scene in which the pictures were passed out, reported, \\"When we finished that scene there wasn't one of us whose face wasn't streaked with tears\\", even Spinney underneath his costume. Jon Stone, who directed the episode, wanted to do another take, although Spinney later said, \\"There was nothing wrong with that take. It was perfect.\\" Cameraman Frankie Biondo was touched by the performance. A book, entitled I'll Miss You, Mr. Hooper and based upon the script for the episode, was published in 1984. The book was also written by Stiles. According to Ren√©e Cherow-O'Leary, Stiles and the editorial staff of the CTW's book division worked with the show's research staff and used the same educational content information and research the show's producers used to create the episode.Cherow-O'Leary, Ren√®e (2001). \\"Carrying Sesame Street into Print: Sesame Street Magazine, Sesame Street Parents, and Sesame Street Books\\".

It addresses many of the social and intellectual issues faced by the African Americans in the early twentieth century, including black nationalism, the relationship between black identity and Marxism, and the reformist racial policies of Booker T. Washington, as well as issues of individuality and personal identity. Invisible Man won the U.S. National Book Award for Fiction in 1953. \\"National Book Awards ‚Äì 1953\\".

Time magazine included the novel in its TIME 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005, calling it \\"the quintessential American picaresque of the 20th century,\\" rather than a \\"race novel, or even a bildungsroman.\\" Malcolm Bradbury and Richard Ruland recognize an existential vision with a \\"Kafka-like absurdity.\\"Malcolm Bradbury and Richard Ruland, From Puritanism to Postmodernism: A History of American Literature.

New York: Random House, 1952. that he started to write what would eventually become Invisible Man in a barn in Waitsfield, Vermont, in the summer of 1945 while on sick leave from the Merchant Marine. The book took five years to complete with one year off for what Ellison termed an \\"ill- conceived short novel.\\" Invisible Man was published as a whole in 1952. Ellison had published a section of the book in 1947, the famous \\"Battle Royal\\" scene, which had been shown to Cyril Connolly, the editor of Horizon magazine by Frank Taylor, one of Ellison's early supporters. In his speech accepting the 1953 National Book Award, Ellison said that he considered the novel's chief significance to be its \\"experimental attitude.\\" Before Invisible Man, many (if not most) novels dealing with African Americans were written solely for social protest, most notably, Native Son and Uncle Tom's Cabin. By contrast, the narrator in Invisible Man says, \\"I am not complaining, nor am I protesting either,\\" signaling the break from the normal protest novel that Ellison held about his work. Likewise, in the essay 'The World and the Jug,' which is a response to Irving Howe's essay 'Black Boys and Native Sons,' which \\"pit[s] Ellison and [James] Baldwin against [Richard] Wright and then,\\" as Ellison would say, \\"gives Wright the better argument,\\" Ellison makes a fuller statement about the position he held about his book in the larger canon of work by an American who happens to be African. In the opening paragraph to that essay Ellison poses three questions: \\"Why is it so often true that when critics confront the American as Negro they suddenly drop their advanced critical armament and revert with an air of confident superiority to quite primitive modes of analysis? Why is it that Sociology-oriented critics seem to rate literature so far below politics and ideology that they would rather kill a novel than modify their presumptions concerning a given reality which it seeks in its own terms to project? Finally, why is it that so many of those who would tell us the meaning of Negro life never bother to learn how varied it really is?\\" Placing Invisible Man within the canon of either the Harlem Renaissance or the Black Arts Movement is difficult. It owes allegiance to both and neither at the same time. Interestingly enough, Ellison's own resistance to being pigeonholed by his peers bubbled over into his statement to Irving Howe about what he deemed to be a relative vs. an ancestor. He says, to Howe: \\"...perhaps you will understand when I say that he [Wright] did not influence me if I point out that while one can do nothing about choosing one's relatives, one can, as an artist, choose one's 'ancestors.' Wright was, in this sense, a 'relative'; Hemingway an 'ancestor.' \\" And it was this idea of \\"playing the field,\\" so to speak, not being \\"all-in,\\" that lead to some of Ellison's more staunch critics. The aforementioned Howe, in \\"Black Boys and Native Sons,\\" but also the likes of other black writers such as John Oliver Killens, who once denounced Invisible Man by saying: ‚ÄúThe Negro people need Ralph Ellison‚Äôs Invisible Man like we need a hole in the head or a stab in the back. ... It is a vicious distortion of Negro life.\\" Ellison's \\"ancestors\\" included, among others, The Waste Land by T.S. Eliot.Eliot, T. S. (1963) Collected Poems, 1909‚Äì1962 In an interview with Richard Kostelanetz, Ellison states that what he had learned from the poem was imagery, and also improvisation techniques he had only before seen in jazz.Ellison, Ralph and Richard Kostelanetz. \\"An Interview with Ralph Ellison.\\" The Iowa Review 19.3 (1989): 1-10. Some other influences include William Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway. Ellison once called Faulkner the South's greatest artist. Likewise, in the Spring 1955 Paris Review, Ellison said of Hemingway: \\"I read him to learn his sentence structure and how to organize a story. I guess many young writers were doing this, but I also used his description of hunting when I went into the fields the next day. I had been hunting since I was eleven, but no one had broken down the process of wing-shooting for me, and it was from reading Hemingway that I learned to lead a bird. When he describes something in print, believe him; believe him even when he describes the process of art in terms of baseball or boxing; he‚Äôs been there.\\" Some of Ellison's influences had a more direct impact on his novel as when Ellison divulges this, in his introduction to the 30th anniversary of Invisible Man, that the \\"character\\" (\\"in the dual sense of the word\\") who had announced himself on his page he \\"associated, ever so distantly, with the narrator of Dostoevsky's Notes From Underground\\". Although, despite the \\"distantly\\" remark, it appears that Ellison used that novella more than just on that occasion. The beginning of Invisible Man, for example, seems to be structured very similar to Notes from Underground: \\"I am a sick man\\" compared to \\"I am an invisible man\\". Arnold Rampersad, Ellison's biographer, expounds that Melville had a profound influence on Ellison's freedom to describe race so acutely and generously. [The narrator] \\"resembles no one else in previous fiction so much as he resembles Ishmael of Moby-Dick.\\" Ellison signals his debt in the prologue to the novel, where the narrator remembers a moment of truth under the influence of marijuana and evokes a church service: \\"Brothers and sisters, my text this morning is the 'Blackness of Blackness.' And the congregation answers: 'That blackness is most black, brother, most black...'\\" In this scene Ellison \\"reprises a moment in the second chapter of Moby-Dick\\", where Ishmael wanders around New Bedford looking for a place to spend the night and enters a black church: \\"It was a negro church; and the preacher's text was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping and wailing and teeth-gnashing there.\\" According to Rampersad, it was Melville who \\"empowered Ellison to insist on a place in the American literary tradition\\" by his example of \\"representing the complexity of race and racism so acutely and generously\\" in Moby-Dick.[12] Other most likely influences to Ellison, by way of how much he speaks about them, are: Kenneth Burke, Andre Malraux, Mark Twain, to name a few. Political influences and the Communist Party The letters he wrote to fellow novelist Richard Wright as he started working on the novel provide evidence for his disillusion with and defection from the Communist Party for perceived revisionism. In a letter to Wright on August 18, 1945, Ellison poured out his anger toward party leaders for betraying African-American and Marxist class politics during the war years: \\"If they want to play ball with the bourgeoisie they needn't think they can get away with it... Maybe we can't smash the atom, but we can, with a few well-chosen, well-written words, smash all that crummy filth to hell.\\"Carol Polsgrove, Divided Minds: Intellectuals and the Civil Rights Movement (2001), pp. 66-69. Plot summary The narrator, an unnamed black man, begins by describing his living conditions: an underground room wired with hundreds of electric lights, operated by power stolen from the city's electric grid. He reflects on the various ways in which he has experienced social invisibility during his life and begins to tell his story, returning to his teenage years. The narrator lives in a small Southern town and, upon graduating from high school, wins a scholarship to an all-black college. However, to receive it, he must first take part in a brutal, humiliating battle royal for the entertainment of the town's rich white dignitaries. One afternoon during his junior year at the college, the narrator chauffeurs Mr. Norton, a visiting rich white trustee, out among the old slave- quarters beyond the campus. By chance, he stops at the cabin of Jim Trueblood, who has caused a scandal by impregnating both his wife and his daughter in his sleep. Trueblood's account horrifies Mr. Norton so badly that he asks the narrator to find him a drink. The narrator drives him to a bar filled with prostitutes and patients from a nearby mental hospital. The mental patients rail against both of them and eventually overwhelm the orderly assigned to keep the patients under control, injuring Mr. Norton in the process. The narrator hurries Mr. Norton away from the chaotic scene and back to campus. Dr. Bledsoe, the college president, excoriates the narrator for showing Mr. Norton the underside of black life beyond the campus and expels him. However, Bledsoe gives several sealed letters of recommendation to the narrator, to be delivered to friends of the college in order to assist him in finding a job so that he may eventually re-enroll. The narrator travels to New York and distributes his letters, with no success; the son of one recipient shows him the letter, which reveals Bledsoe's intent to never admit the narrator as a student again. Acting on the son's suggestion, the narrator seeks work at the Liberty Paint factory, renowned for its pure white paint. He is assigned first to the shipping department, then to the boiler room, whose chief attendant, Lucius Brockway, is highly paranoid and suspects that the narrator is trying to take his job. This distrust worsens after the narrator stumbles into a union meeting, and Brockway attacks the narrator and tricks him into setting off an explosion in the boiler room. The narrator is hospitalized and subjected to shock treatment, overhearing the doctors' discussion of him as a possible mental patient. After leaving the hospital, the narrator faints on the streets of Harlem and is taken in by Mary Rambo, a kindly old-fashioned woman who reminds him of his relatives in the South. He later happens across the eviction of an elderly black couple and makes an impassioned speech that incites the crowd to attack the law enforcement officials in charge of the proceedings. The narrator escapes over the rooftops and is confronted by Brother Jack, the leader of a group known as \\"the Brotherhood\\" that professes its commitment to bettering conditions in Harlem and the rest of the world. At Jack's urging, the narrator agrees to join and speak at rallies to spread the word among the black community. Using his new salary, he pays Mary back the rent he owes her and moves into an apartment provided by the Brotherhood. The rallies go smoothly at first, with the narrator receiving extensive indoctrination on the Brotherhood's ideology and methods. Soon, though, he encounters trouble from Ras the Exhorter, a fanatical black nationalist who believes that the Brotherhood is controlled by whites. Neither the narrator nor Tod Clifton, a youth leader within the Brotherhood, is particularly swayed by his words. The narrator is later called before a meeting of the Brotherhood and accused of putting his own ambitions ahead of the group. He is reassigned to another part of the city to address issues concerning women, seduced by the wife of a Brotherhood member, and eventually called back to Harlem when Clifton is reported missing and the Brotherhood's membership and influence begin to falter. The narrator can find no trace of Clifton at first, but soon discovers him selling dancing Sambo dolls on the street, having become disillusioned with the Brotherhood. Clifton is shot and killed by a policeman while resisting arrest; at his funeral, the narrator delivers a rousing speech that rallies the crowd to support the Brotherhood again. At an emergency meeting, Jack and the other Brotherhood leaders criticize the narrator for his unscientific arguments and the narrator determines that the group has no real interest in the black community's problems. The narrator returns to Harlem, trailed by Ras's men, and buys a hat and a pair of sunglasses to elude them. As a result, he is repeatedly mistaken for a man named Rinehart, known as a lover, a hipster, a gambler, a briber, and a spiritual leader. Understanding that Rinehart has adapted to white society at the cost of his own identity, the narrator resolves to undermine the Brotherhood by feeding them dishonest information concerning the Harlem membership and situation. After seducing the wife of one member in a fruitless attempt to learn their new activities, he discovers that riots have broken out in Harlem due to widespread unrest. He realizes that the Brotherhood has been counting on such an event in order to further its own aims. The narrator gets mixed up with a gang of looters, who burn down a tenement building, and wanders away from them to find Ras, now on horseback, armed with a spear and shield, and calling himself \\"the Destroyer.\\" Ras shouts for the crowd to lynch the narrator, but the narrator attacks him with the spear and escapes into an underground coal bin. Two white men seal him in, leaving him alone to ponder the racism he has experienced in his life. The epilogue returns to the present, with the narrator stating that he is ready to return to the world because he has spent enough time hiding from it. He explains that he has told his story in order to help people see past his own invisibility, and also to provide a voice for people with a similar plight: \\"Who knows but that, on the lower frequencies, I speak for you?\\"  Reception  Critic Orville Prescott of The New York Times called the novel \\"the most impressive work of fiction by an American Negro which I have ever read,\\" and felt it marked \\"the appearance of a richly talented writer.\\" Novelist Saul Bellow in his review found it \\"a book of the very first order, a superb book...it is tragi-comic, poetic, the tone of the very strongest sort of creative intelligence.\\" George Mayberry of The New Republic said Ellison \\"is a master at catching the shape, flavor and sound of the common vagaries of human character and experience.\\" In The Paris Review, literary critic Harold Bloom referred to Invisible Man, along with Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God, as \\"the only full scale works of fiction I have read by American blacks in this century that have survival possibilities at all.\\" Anthony Burgess described the novel as \\"a masterpiece\\".

In 1946 Ryle and Derek Vonberg were the first people to publish interferometric astronomical measurements at radio wavelengths. With improved equipment, Ryle observed the most distant known galaxies in the universe at that time. He was the first Professor of Radio Astronomy at the University of Cambridge, and founding director of the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory. He was Astronomer Royal from 1972 to 1982.About Sir Martin Ryle Ryle and Antony Hewish shared the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1974, the first Nobel prize awarded in recognition of astronomical research.Press release about Martin Ryle's Nobel Prize. In the 1970s, Ryle turned the greater part of his attention from astronomy to social and political issues which he considered to be more urgent. Education and early life Martin Ryle was born in Brighton, the son of Professor John Alfred Ryle and Miriam (n√©e Scully) Ryle. He was the nephew of Oxford University Professor of Philosophy Gilbert Ryle. After studying at Bradfield College, Ryle studied physics at Christ Church, Oxford. In 1939, Ryle worked with the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) on the design of antennas for airborne radar equipment during World War II. After the war, he received a fellowship at the Cavendish Laboratory. Career and research The focus of Ryle's early work in Cambridge was on radio waves from the Sun.Obs 104 (1984) 283QJRAS 26 (1985) 358The Papers of Martin Ryle have been catalogued by Anna-K Mayer and Tim Powell, NCUACS, in 2009 and are deposited with the Churchill Archives Centre, Cambridge. His interest quickly shifted to other areas, however, and he decided early on that the Cambridge group should develop new observing techniques. As a result, Ryle was the driving force in the creation and improvement of astronomical interferometry and aperture synthesis, which paved the way for massive upgrades in the quality of radio astronomical data. In 1946 Ryle built the first multi-element astronomical radio interferometer. ‚Äì Observations from the first multi-element astronomical radio interferometer Ryle guided the Cambridge radio astronomy group in the production of several important radio source catalogues. One such catalogue, the Third Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources (3C) in 1959 helped lead to the discovery of the first quasi-stellar object (quasar). While serving as university lecturer in physics at Cambridge from 1948 to 1959, Ryle became director of the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory in 1957 and professor of radio astronomy in 1959. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1952, was knighted in 1966 (p 519 of) and succeeded Sir Richard Woolley as Astronomer Royal from 1972‚Äì1982. Ryle and Antony Hewish shared the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1974, the first Nobel prize awarded in recognition of astronomical research. In 1968 Ryle served as professor of astronomy at Gresham College, London. =Personality= According to numerous reports Ryle was quick-thinking, impatient with those slower than himself and charismatic (pp 502, 508, 510 of). He was also idealistic (p 519 of), a characteristic he shared with his father (p 499 of, Ryle catalogue at Churchill Archives Centre). In an interview (p271 ofWilliams R ed The Best of The Science Show. Nelson, 1983.) in 1982 he said \\"At times one feels that one should almost have a car sticker saying 'Stop Science Now' because we're getting cleverer and cleverer, but we do not increase the wisdom to go with it.\\" He was also intense and volatile (p 327 ofKragh, H. Cosmology and Controversy: the historical development of two theories of the universe. Princeton University Press, 1996.), the latter characteristic being associated with his mother (p 499 of, Folder A.20 of). The historian Owen Chadwick described him as \\"a rare personality, of exceptional sensitivity of mind, fears and anxieties, care and compassion, humour and anger.\\" (Folder A.28 of) Ryle was sometimes considered difficult to work with ‚Äì he often worked in an office at the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory to avoid disturbances from other members of the Cavendish Laboratory and to avoid getting into heated arguments, as Ryle had a hot temper. Ryle worried that Cambridge would lose its standing in the radio astronomy community as other radio astronomy groups had much better funding, so he encouraged a certain amount of secrecy about his aperture synthesis methods in order to keep an advantage for the Cambridge group. Ryle had heated arguments with Fred Hoyle of the Institute of Astronomy about Hoyle's steady state universe, which restricted collaboration between the Cavendish Radio Astronomy Group and the Institute of Astronomy during the 1960s. = War, peace and energy = Ryle was a new physics graduate and an experienced radio ham in 1939, when the Second World War started. He played an important part in the Allied war effort, working mainly in radar countermeasures. After the war, \\"He returned to Cambridge with a determination to devote himself to pure science, unalloyed by the taint of war.\\" In the 1970s, Ryle turned the greater part of his attention from astronomy to social and political issues which he considered to be more urgent. With publications from 1976 and continuing, despite illness until he died in 1984, he pursued a passionate and intensive program on the socially responsible use of science and technology.Rowan- Robinson, M. and Rudolf, A. (1985) Martin Ryle's Letter. Menard Press. His main themes were: * Warning the world of the horrific dangers of nuclear armaments, notably in his pamphlet Towards the Nuclear Holocaust.Ryle, M. Towards the Nuclear Holocaust. Menard Press, 1981. * Criticism of nuclear power, as in Is there a case for nuclear power? * Research and promotion of alternative energy and energy efficiency, as in Short-term Storage and Wind Power Availability. * Calling for the responsible use of science and technology. \\"...we should strive to see how the vast resources now diverted towards the destruction of life are turned instead to the solution of the problems which both rich - but especially the poor - countries of the world now face.\\" In 1983 Ryle responded to a request from the President of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences for suggestions of topics to be discussed at a meeting on Science and Peace. Ryle's reply was published posthumously in Martin Ryle's Letter. An abridged version appears in New Scientist with the title Martin Ryle's Last Testament.Ryle M. (1985) \\"Martin Ryle's Last Testament\\". New Scientist 105 (14 February): 36-37. The letter ends with \\"Our cleverness has grown prodigiously ‚Äì but not our wisdom.\\" =Honours and awards= Ryle was awarded numerous prizes and honours including: * Elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1952 *Hughes Medal (1954) *Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1964) *Fernand Holweck Medal and Prize (1965) *Henry Draper Medal of the National Academy of Sciences (1965) *Albert A. Michelson Medal of the Franklin Institute (1971) *Royal Medal (1973) *Bruce Medal (1974) *Nobel Prize in Physics (1974) *Ryle Telescope at Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory * In 1965 Ryle co-delivered the Royal Institution Christmas Lecture on Exploration of the Universe. Personal life In their early years Martin and his elder brother received lessons at home in carpentry (p 498 of ) and manual skills became important for him throughout his life. This was for relaxation ‚Äì he built boats to his own designs (p 498 of ) ‚Äì and professionally. In his wartime radar work (Ryle M. (1985) \\"D-13:some personal memories of 24th‚Äì28th May 1944\\". IEE Proceedings 132 (6 October): 438‚Äì440.), his post-war radio-telescope building (p 510 of ) and his late researches into wind energy (p 517 of ) he was a hands-on practical engineer as well as a scientist. Ryle also had a lifelong interest in sailing (p 498 of) and this matched his choice when in the 1970s he turned his research subject from astronomy to wind energy (pp 420‚Äì422 ofLongair, M. Maxwell's Enduring Legacy: a scientific history of the Cavendish laboratory. Cambridge University Press, 2016.) Another practical skill acquired by Martin in youth that later served him well in his professional career was as a radio 'ham'. While still at School (Bradfield College) he built his own transmitter and obtained a Post Office licence to operate it (pp 498‚Äì499 of), with the GB-Callsign G3CY. In 1936 the family moved to a house in Cambridge which became Martin's home after the war. In 1947 he and Rowena Palmer married and they lived in this house for rest of Martin's life. They had three children, born in 1949, 1951 and 1952. Ryle died on 14 October 1984, in Cambridge.

He won the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the non-spherical geometry of atomic nuclei. Early life Mottelson was born in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Georgia (Blum) and Goodman Mottelson, an engineer. He graduated from Lyons Township High School in LaGrange, Illinois. He received a Bachelor's degree from Purdue University in 1947, and a Ph.D. in nuclear physics from Harvard University in 1950. Career He moved to Institute for Theoretical Physics (later the Niels Bohr Institute) in Copenhagen on the Sheldon Traveling Fellowship from Harvard, and remained in Denmark. In 1953 he was appointed staff member in CERN's Theoretical Study Group, which was based in Copenhagen, a position he held until he became professor at the newly formed Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics (Nordita) in 1957. He was a visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley in Spring 1959. In 1971 he became a naturalized Danish citizen. In 1950‚Äì51, James Rainwater and Aage Bohr had developed models of the atomic nucleus which began to take into account the behaviour of the individual nucleons. These models, which moved beyond the simpler liquid drop treatment of the nucleus as having effectively no internal structure, were the first models which could explain a number of nuclear properties, including the non-spherical distribution of charge in certain nuclei. Mottelson worked with Aage Bohr to compare the theoretical models with experimental data. In three papers which were published in 1952‚Äì53, Bohr and Mottelson demonstrated close agreement between theory and experiment, for example showing that the energy levels of certain nuclei could be described by a rotation spectrum. This work stimulated new theoretical and experimental studies. =Nobel Prize (1975)= Rainwater, Bohr and Mottelson were jointly awarded the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physics \\"for the discovery of the connection between collective motion and particle motion in atomic nuclei and the development of the theory of the structure of the atomic nucleus based on this connection\\".Nobel prize citation.

The highest peak, Mount Ballard, rises to . Prior to mining operations commencing there, the mountains were heavily forested with large Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii glauca) and other conifers, but these were all cut down for housing needs and to feed the ore smelting furnaces in Douglas, Arizona, approximately 20 miles due east. Now, the primary vegetation of the Mules consists of manzanita (Arctostaphylos spp.) brush, juniper, lowland oaks and pines, and various grasses. To the east of the mountain range lies Sulphur Springs Valley, and the San Pedro River and Valley to the west. The terrain is very rough, with very steep slopes descending into deep canyons. Common wildlife species include desert mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus eremicus), Coues' White- tailed deer (O. virginianus couesi), Collared Peccary (Pecari tajacu) (locally known as javalinas), various types of rodents, lizards and a wide variety of birds. The upper ridges of the mountains consist primarily of a very hard brecciate limestone, and it is very common to find fossils of clams and snails imbedded in them. Immediately to the east central area of the Mules lies the Lavender Pit, a large and very deep open pit copper mine dug and mined by the Phelps Dodge Corporation between 1951 through 1974. Over a billion tons of copper were extracted from the mine, along with significant quantities gold, silver and lead. Also, as a by-product of the mining operations, high quality turquoise (locally known as Bisbee Blue) was also discovered. On the east central slope of the Mule Mountains can be found the Copper Queen Mine. In its days of production, (late 19th century ‚Äì early 20th century) it was the richest copper deposit ever discovered, causing the accompanying town of Bisbee, Arizona to prosper. Under this part of the Mule Mountains are many mining tunnels dug in pursuit of the rich copper ore. Today, Bisbee (also known as the \\"mile-high city,\\" at elevation ) is largely a tourist town and retirement community along the slopes of Tombstone Canyon in the heart of the Mules. There are currently no organized mining operations in effect in the Mule Mountains. Much of the east/southeastern area of the range is private property, owned by Phelps Dodge Corporation.

During World War II, he worked on the Manhattan Project that developed the first atomic bombs. In 1949, he began developing his theory that, contrary to what was then believed, not all atomic nuclei are spherical. His ideas were later tested and confirmed by Aage Bohr's and Ben Mottelson's experiments. He also contributed to the scientific understanding of X-rays and participated in the United States Atomic Energy Commission and naval research projects. Rainwater joined the physics faculty at Columbia in 1946, where he reached the rank of full professor in 1952 and was named Pupin Professor of Physics in 1982. He received the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award for Physics in 1963 and in 1975 was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, \\"for the discovery of the connection between collective motion and particle motion in atomic nuclei and the development of the theory of the structure of the atomic nucleus based on this connection\\". Early life Leo James Rainwater was born on December 9, 1917, in Council, Idaho, the son of a former civil engineer who ran the local general store, Leo Jaspar Rainwater and his wife Edna Eliza n√©e Teague. He never used his first name and was always referred to as James or Jim. His father died in the great influenza epidemic of 1918 and Rainwater and his mother moved to Hanford, California, where she married George Fowler, a widower with two sons, Freeman and John. In time he also acquired a half- brother, George Fowler, Jr., who became naval officer. At high school he excelled in mathematics, chemistry and physics and was admitted to the California Institute of Technology on the strength of a chemistry competition. He received his Bachelor of Science degree as a physics major in 1939. Manhattan Project Rainwater then chose to undertake postgraduate studies at Columbia University. At the time this was an unusual move for a scholar from California, as Columbia was not then renowned for its physics; but this had recently changed. George B. Pegram had recently built up the physics department, and hired scientists like Enrico Fermi. At Columbia Rainwater studied under Isidor Isaac Rabi, Enrico Fermi, Edward Teller and John R. Dunning. Fermi was engaged in neutron moderator studies that would lead to the construction of the first nuclear reactor, while Dunning and Eugene T. Booth had built Columbia's first cyclotron, in the basement of the Pupin Physics Laboratories. Rainwater received his Master of Arts in 1941. For his Doctor of Philosophy thesis on \\"Neutron beam spectrometer studies of boron, cadmium, and the energy distribution from paraffin\\", written under Dunning's supervision, he built a neutron spectrometer and developed techniques for its use. Rainwater married Emma Louise Smith in March 1942. They had three sons, James, Robert and William and a daughter, Elizabeth Ann, who died from leukaemia when she was nine. Fermi's reactor group moved to the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago in 1942. Rainwater remained at Columbia, where he joined the Manhattan Project's Substitute Alloy Materials (SAM) Laboratories. The Manhattan Project was the Allied effort during World War II to develop atomic bombs. The SAM Laboratories' primary task was the development of gaseous diffusion technology for uranium enrichment, to produce fissile uranium-235 for use in atomic bombs. Rainwater worked with William W. Havens, Jr. and Chien-Shiung Wu, mostly on studies of neutron cross sections, using the neutron spectrometer. After the war, a dozen papers by Dunning, Havens, Rainwater and Wu would be declassified and published. So too was his thesis, published in the Physical Review in two parts with Havens's thesis, and he was awarded his doctorate in 1946. In 1963 he was awarded the United States Atomic Energy Commission's Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award, for his work on the Manhattan Project. Later life Rainwater remained at Columbia as an instructor. In 1948, he began teaching courses on nuclear structure. Niels Bohr and John Wheeler had developed a theoretical treatment for nuclear fission in 1939 that they based on the liquid drop model of the nucleus. This was superseded in 1949 by Maria Goeppert Mayer's nuclear shell model, which could explain more about the structure of heavy elements than the older theory but it still had limits. At a colloquium at Columbia in 1949, Charles H. Townes reported experimental results that indicated quadrupole moments greater than those indicated by the shell model. It occurred to Rainwater that this could be explained and the differences between the liquid drop and nuclear shell models could be reconciled, if the atomic nucleus were not spherical, as had been assumed but could assume other shapes. Rainwater published his theoretical paper in 1950. By chance, that year he was sharing an office with Aage Bohr, who took up the challenge of experimentally verifying Rainwater's theory. Bohr and Ben Mottelson published their results in three papers in 1952 and 1953 that conclusively confirmed the theory. Rainwater felt that his model was overlooked. He later recalled that: With funding from the Office of Naval Research, Rainwater built a synchrotron, which became operational in 1950, at the Nevis Laboratories, on an estate on the Hudson River at Irvington, New York, willed to Columbia University by the DuPont family. He became a full professor in 1952 and was the director of Nevis Laboratories from 1951 to 1954 and again from 1957 to 1961. He worked with his student Val Fitch on studies of muonic atoms, atoms where an electron is replaced by a muon. After 1965, he worked on turning the Nevis synchrotron into a meson facility. When a reporter rang in 1975 to inform him that he had won the Nobel Prize in Physics, he initially thought that it was for his work on muonic atoms. Several hours passed before he discovered that it was for his work on atomic structure, the Nobel Prize being shared with Bohr and Mottelson. He was a fellow of the American Physical Society, the New York Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and was a member of the National Academy of Science, the American Institute of Physics, the American Association of Physics Teachers and the Optical Society of America. Rainwater succeeded Robert R. Wilson as Michael I. Pupin Professor of Physics in 1983. Rainwater collapsed after a lecture at the Pupin Laboratories in 1985 but was revived by a student who knew how to administer CPR.

The Modoc are a Native American people who originally lived in the area which is now northeastern California and central Southern Oregon. They are currently divided between Oregon and Oklahoma and are enrolled in either of two federally recognized tribes, the Klamath Tribes in Oregon and the Modoc Tribe of Oklahoma. Current population and geography E.A Burbank, 1901. About 600 Modoc live in Klamath County, Oregon, in and around their ancestral homelands. This group includes those who stayed on the reservation during the Modoc War, as well as the descendants of those who chose to return in 1909 to Oregon from Indian Territory in Oklahoma or Kansas. Since that time, many have followed the path of the Klamath.A Guide to the Indian Tribes of the Pacific Northwest, entries \\"Klamath Tribes\\" and \\"Modoc\\" The shared tribal government of the Klamath, Modoc and Yahooskin in Oregon is known as the Klamath Tribes. Two hundred Modoc live in Oklahoma on a small reservation in Ottawa County, Oklahoma, that the federal government purchased for them. Originally they were placed on the Quapaw Indian Reservation in Oklahoma's far northeast corner. They are descendants of the band Captain Jack (Kintpuash) led during the Modoc War. The federal government officially recognized the Modoc Tribe of Oklahoma in 1978, and its constitution was approved in 1991. Early population Estimates for the pre-contact populations of most native groups in California have varied substantially. James Mooney put the aboriginal population of the Modoc at 400. Alfred L. Kroeber estimated the Modoc population within California as 500 at the year 1770.Kroeber, p. 883 University of Oregon anthropologist Theodore Stern suggested that there had been a total of about 500 Modoc.Stern, pp. 446‚Äì456 In 1846, the population may have included \\"perhaps 600 warriors (an overestimate, probably)\\".Thrapp, p. 1276 History =Pre-contact= Until the 19th century, when European explorers first encountered the Modoc, like all Plateau Indians, they caught salmon during salmon runs and migrated seasonally to hunt and gather other food.Arnold, et al., p. 507 In winter, they built earthen dugout lodges shaped like beehives, covered with sticks and plastered with mud, near lake shores with reliable sources of seeds from aquatic wokas plants and fishing.Pease, pp. 46‚Äì48 Neighboring groups In addition to the Klamath, with whom they shared a language and the Modoc Plateau, the groups neighboring the Modoc home were: *Shasta on the Klamath River; *Rogue River Athabaskans and Takelma west over the Cascade Mountains; *Northern Paiute east in the desert; *Karuk and Yurok further down the Klamath River; and *Achomawi or Pit River to the south, in the meadows of the Pit River drainages. The Modoc, Northern Paiute, and Achomawi shared Goose Lake Valley. Settlements The known Modoc village sites are Agawesh, where Willow Creek enters Lower Klamath Lake, of the Gombatwa¬∑s or Lower Klamath Lake People Band; Kumbat and Pashha on the shores of Tule Lake of the Pasganwa¬∑s or Tule Lake People Band; and Wachamshwash and Nushalt-Hagak-ni on the Lost River of the Goƒ°ewa¬∑s or Lower Lost River People Band.Kroeber, pp. 305‚Äì335 The Modoc have also been known as the Modok (Brandt and Davis-Kimball xvi). =First contact= In the 1820s, Peter Skene Ogden, an explorer for the Hudson's Bay Company, established trade with the Klamath people north of the Modoc.Waldman, p. 134 =Applegate Trail established= Brothers Jesse and Lindsay Applegate, accompanied by 13 other white settlers, established the Applegate Trail, or South Emigrant Trail, in 1846. It connected a point on the Oregon Trail near Fort Hall, Idaho, and the Willamette Valley in western Oregon.Barr, p. 275 The new route was created to encourage European-Americans to come to western Oregon, and to eliminate the hazards encountered on the Columbia Route.Soil Survey of Douglas County Area, p. 20 Since the Hudson's Bay Company controlled the Columbia Route, development of an alternate route enabled migration even if there were trouble between the United States and the United Kingdom.Grubbs, p. 25 The Applegate brothers became the first known white people in present-day Lava Beds National Monument. The opening of the Applegate Trail appeared to bring the first regular contact between the Modoc and the European-American settlers, who had largely ignored their territory before.Pease, pp. 60‚Äì66 Many of the events of the Modoc War took place along the trail.Philip, p. 66 =Emigrant invasion= From 1846 to 1873, thousands of emigrants entered the Modoc territory. Beginning in 1847, the Modoc raided the invading emigrants on the Applegate TrailMichno, pp. 90‚Äì91 under the leadership of Old Chief Schonchin. In September 1852, the Modoc destroyed an emigrant train at Bloody Point on the east shore of Tule Lake, killing all but three of the 65 people in the party. The Modoc took two young girls as captives.Heard, p. 33 One or both of them may have been killed several years later by jealous Modoc women.Murray, pp. 24‚Äì28 The only man to survive the attack made his way to Yreka, California. After hearing his news, Yreka settlers organized a militia under Sheriff Charles McDermit, Jim Crosby, and Ben Wright. They went to the scene of the massacre to bury the dead and avenge their death. Crosby's party had a skirmish with a band of Modoc and returned to Yreka.Walling, p. 204Murray, p. 74 Wright and a small group stayed on to avenge the deaths. He was a notorious Indian hater.\\"Modoc NF History, 1945 -- Chapter II, Early History Emigrant Traills and Indian Warfare.\\" U.S. Forest Service. Retrieved 28 May 2012. Accounts differ as to what took place when Wright's party met the Modoc on the Lost River, but most agree that Wright planned to ambush them, which he did in November 1852. Wright and his forces attacked, killing approximately 40 Modoc, in what came to be known as the \\"Ben Wright Massacre.\\" Historians have estimated that the Modoc killed at least 300 emigrants and settlers between 1846 and 1873. Perhaps as many Modoc were killed by settlers and slave traders. =Treaty with the United States= L to R, standing: US Indian agent, Winema (Tobey) Riddle, a Modoc; and her husband Frank Riddle, with four Modoc women sitting in the front two rows. Photographed by Eadweard Muybridge, 1873. The United States, the Klamath, the Modoc, and the Yahooskin band of Snake tribes signed a treaty in 1864 that established the Klamath Reservation. It required the tribes to cede the land bounded on the north by the 44th parallel, on the west and south by the ridges of the Cascade Mountains, and on the east by lines touching Goose Lake and Henley Lake back up to the 44th parallel.Report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, pp. 104‚Äì105 In return, the United States was to make a lump sum payment of $35,000, and annual payments totaling $80,000 over 15 years, as well as provide infrastructure and staff for a reservation. The treaty provided that if the Indians drank or stored intoxicating liquor on the reservation, the payments could be withheld and that the United States could locate additional tribes on the reservation in the future. The tribes requested Lindsay Applegate as the US Indian agent. The treaty required that the Modoc surrender their lands near Lost River, Tule Lake, and Lower Klamath Lake in exchange for lands in the Upper Klamath Valley.Neiderheiser, p. 260 They did so, under the leadership of Chief Schonchin.Heard, p. 275 The Indian agent estimated the total population of the three tribes at about 2,000 when the treaty was signed.Report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, pp. 10, 102 The land of the reservation did not provide enough food for both the Klamath and the Modoc peoples. Illness and tension between the tribes increased. The Modoc requested a separate reservation closer to their ancestral home, but neither the federal nor the California government approved it.Waldman, p. 169 In 1870 Kintpuash (also called Captain Jack) led a band of Modoc to leave the reservation and return to their traditional homelands. They built a village near the Lost River. These Modoc had not been adequately represented in the treaty negotiations and wished to end the harassment by the Klamath on the reservation.Ruby and Brown, p. 211 =Modoc War= Kintpuash (Captain Jack), a Modoc leader in the Modoc War. In November 1872, the U.S. Army was sent to Lost River to attempt to force Kintpuash's band back to the reservation. A battle broke out, and the Modoc escaped to what is called Captain Jack's Stronghold in what is now Lava Beds National Monument, California. The band of fewer than 53 warriors was able to hold off the 3,000 U.S. Army troops for several months, defeating them in combat several times. In April 1873, the Modoc left the Stronghold and began to splinter. Kintpuash and his group were the last to be captured, on June 4, 1873, when they voluntarily gave themselves up. U.S. government personnel had assured them that their people would be treated fairly and the warriors would be allowed to live on their own land.Arnold, et al., pp. 507‚Äì509 The U.S. Army tried, convicted and executed Kintpuash and three of his warriors in October 1873 for the murder of Major General Edward Canby earlier that year at a parley. Canby had violated agreements made with the Modoc. The Army sent the rest of the band to Oklahoma as prisoners of war with Scarfaced Charley as their chief. The tribe's spiritual leader, Curley Headed Doctor, was also forced to remove to Indian Territory.Kessel and Wooster, p. 160 In the 1870s, Peter Cooper brought Indians to speak to Indian rights groups in eastern cities. One of the delegations was from the Modoc and Klamath tribes. In 1909, the group in Oklahoma was given permission to return to Oregon. Several people did, but most stayed at their new home.History , Modoc Tribe of Oklahoma official website Culture The original language of the Modoc and that of the Klamath, their neighbors to the north, were branches of the family of Plateau Penutian languages. The Klamath and Modoc languages together are sometimes referred to as Lutuamian languages. Both peoples called themselves maklaks, meaning \\"people\\".Waldman, pp. 134, 168 To distinguish between the tribes, the Modoc called themselves Moatokni maklaks, from muat meaning \\"South\\".Kroeber, p. 319 The Achomawi, a band of the Pit River tribe, called them Lutuami, meaning \\"Lake Dwellers\\". The religion of the Modoc is not known in detail. The number five figured heavily in ritual, as in the Shuyuhalsh, a five-night dance rite of passage for adolescent girls. A sweat lodge was used for purification and mourning ceremonies.Kroeber, pp. 320‚Äì321 Namesakes Modoc Plateau, Modoc National Forest, Modoc County, California; Modoc, Indiana; and numerous other places are named after this group of people.

He was the son and heir of Sancho VI, whom he followed as the second king to hold the title of King of Navarre. Sancho VII was the first to use the chains of Navarre as his blazon, a symbol that later would become the main one of Navarre, and the last member of the Jim√©nez dynasty, which had ruled since the 9th century.  Youth  Sancho was probably the eldest child of Sancho VI and Sancha, daughter of Alfonso VII of Le√≥n, born soon after their marriage, probably in Tudela, their usual residence. Sancho's younger sister Berengaria was married to Richard I of England in 1191 on the island of Cyprus on the way to the Holy Land for the Third Crusade. Sancho and Richard were reputed to have been good friends and close allies, even before the marriage brought them together. The French took advantage of Richard's captivity in Germany and captured certain key fortresses of the Plantagenet dominions including Loches. When Richard returned to his continental lands in 1194, the knights of Sancho were besieging the castle for him. As soon as Richard arrived though, Sancho was forced to return to Navarre at the news of the death of his father. He was crowned in Pamplona on 15 August.  Reign  thumbuprightleftKingdom of Navarre during the rule of Sancho VII: Sancho arrived late at the Battle of Alarcos in 1195 and thus ruined good relations with Alfonso VIII of Castile. The ensuing confrontation resulted in Sancho devastating Soria and Almaz√°n and Alfonso accepted the Peace of Tarazona. Sancho made expeditions against Murcia and Andalusia, and, between 1198 and 1200, he campaigned in Africa, probably in the service of the Almohads, whose help he wanted against Castile. Taking advantage of his absence, Alfonso VIII of Castile and Peter II of Aragon invaded Navarre, which lost the provinces of √Ålava, Guip√∫zcoa, and Biscay to Castile. These conquests were subsequently confirmed by the Treaty of Guadalajara (1207). Sancho's leadership was decisive in the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in the year 1212. In that engagement, the Christian forces of Sancho, Alfonso, Afonso II of Portugal, and Peter II of Arag√≥nGuggenberger, Anthony, A General History of the Christian Era: The Papacy and the Empire, Vol.1, (B. Herder, 1913), 372. allied to defeat the forces of the Almohad Caliph Muhammad an-Nasir. Sancho's troops cut the chains guarding the tent and Slavic guards ring of the Miramamol√≠n, supreme commander of the Al-Andalusian Forces. For this, it is believed the chains became the symbol of Navarre and replaced the sable eagle on a golden field with a golden chain on a gules field in the Navarrese coat of arms. But others suspect they represented the Basques' star-like Sun of Death seen on their Hilarri (Basques' Stelae) or houses traditionally for protection, and perhaps painted on their shields too with the same religious purpose, meaning of Life or Death, or the new Imagery used for Jesus or Christianity as for others were the Christi Anagram or plain Cross on the shield. Sancho's relations with the countries north of the Pyrenees were notably better than his Castilian ones. Several Pyrenean counties declared themselves his vassals and he concluded treaties with John, King of England, and the various Aragonese kings of his time, the aforementioned Peter II and James I. With the latter he signed at Tudela, in 1231, which was never finished, a treaty stating that whoever survived the other would inherit unopposed the other's kingdom. Sancho continued the construction of a new cathedral in Pamplona, as begun by his father and to be finished by his successor. The construction of a certain Gothic bridge over the Ebro has also been attributed to him.  Succession  Statues of Sancho and his wife (Capilla de San Agust√≠n, Roncesvalles) Sancho VII was married twice. His first wife was Constance, daughter of Raymond VI of Toulouse and Beatrice of B√©ziers, whom he married in 1195. He repudiated her a few years later. The identity of his second wife is disputed; some sources mention her as Clemence, daughter of Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor, while other sources claim she was the daughter of Yusuf II, an emir from Morocco. Sancho VII had no known children by either wife. According to Charles of Viana, however, he had a son with his second wife, who died in an accident when he was 15 years old. As the result of prolonged and painful illness, starting with a varicose ulcer on his right leg and ashamed of it and his consequent obesity, Sancho went into retirement at Tudela at some point, when his youngest sister Blanche came from Champagne and took administration of the kingdom until she died in 1229. His eldest sister, Berengaria, Queen of England, died in 1230, thus leaving Sancho alone among the children of Sancho VI. When he died in his castle at Tudela, probably of complications related to the varicose ulcer in his leg, his only nephew and Blanche's son Theobald IV of Champagne was recognized as his successor.  Legacy  Statue in Tudela According to Alberic de Trois-Fontaines, Sancho left a large library, although the number of 1.7 million books is clearly exaggerated.√âlie Berger, Histoire de Blanche de Castille: reine de France (Paris, 1895), p. 213n. The cultural contacts with the Muslim Kingdoms that he visited and battled with, his friendship with his brother-in-law King Richard, and his sister Blanche's court of Troyes, at the time the most refined in Europe, must have left an important influence on the King's personal intellect, bringing to him an advantageous outlook from the one well set already by their father at his youth, full however with peccadilloes and other impetuous extravaganza. Sancho left the kingdom with a wealthy treasury and improved communications was in his day one of the most advanced in human rights, and its Jewish community enjoyed the best standing in Christian Europe, which after all had been the work and result of the Jimenez royal house for centuries. He was originally interred in the church of San Nicol√°s, but was later moved to Roncesvalles after much resistance from the local Clergy. His remains have since been exhumed for study and examined by the physician Luis del Campo, also the king's biographer, who measured him at 2.20 metres tall (7'3\\" feet), probably the basis for his \\"strength\\" alias.

The BCN is connected to the rest of the English canal system at several junctions. At its working peak, the BCN contained about 160 miles (257 km) of canals; today just over 100 miles (160 km) are navigable, and the majority of traffic is from tourist and residential narrowboats. History BCN Network (within shaded area) from historical map, 1864 Birmingham Canal Company offices fronting Paradise Street. They backed onto the Old Wharf terminus. The first canal to be built in the area was the Birmingham Canal, built from 1768 to 1772 under the supervision of James Brindley from the, then, edge of Birmingham, with termini at Newhall Wharf (since built over) and Paradise Wharf (also known as Old Wharf) near to Gas Street Basin to meet the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal at Aldersley (north of Wolverhampton). The Birmingham and Fazeley Canal, from Birmingham to Tamworth, followed in 1784 with the Birmingham Canal Company merging with the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal Company immediately, to form what was originally called the Birmingham and Birmingham and Fazeley Canal Company. This cumbersome name was short-lived, and the combined company became known as the Birmingham Canal Navigations from 1794, as the network was expanded. Levels The BCN is built on three main levels, each with its own reservoir. * OD, the Birmingham Level; * OD, the Wolverhampton Level; * OD, the Walsall Level These levels are linked by locks at various places on the network. There are also stretches on their own levels. * The Titford Canal and its branches were built at OD, linked to the Titford Reservoir (Titford Pool). A feeder supplies water to the Edgbaston Reservoir. * A short section of the BCN Old Main Line, at Smethwick Summit, was built at OD. Pumps at either end were built to pump water used by the locks back to the summit ‚Äì one at Spon Lane locks, and one at Smethwick locks: the Smethwick Engine. When the summit became too busy John Smeaton designed a scheme where it was lowered by to the Wolverhampton level, eliminating six locks and providing a parallel set of locks at Smethwick which improved traffic throughput. It also linked to the general Wolverhampton Level supply of water.

He graduated from Far Rockaway High School, a school that also produced fellow laureates Baruch Samuel Blumberg and Richard Feynman. He attended Mercersburg Academy in Pennsylvania, then continued on to study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he received his bachelor's degree in 1952 and his PhD in 1956. He then joined the faculty of Stanford University, becoming a full professor in 1967. Richter was director of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) from 1984 to 1999. He was a Senior Fellow of the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies and Paul Pigott Professor in the Physical Sciences Emeritus of Stanford University. As a professor at Stanford, Richter designed the SPEAR (Stanford Positron-Electron Asymmetric Ring) particle accelerator with the help of another Stanford physics professor, David Ritson. When eventually resources were secured, Richter led the building of SPEAR, with the support of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. With it he led a team that discovered a new subatomic particle he called a œà (psi). This discovery was also made by the team led by Samuel Ting at Brookhaven National Laboratory, but he called the particle J. The particle thus became known as the J/œà meson. Richter and Ting were jointly awarded the 1976 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work. During 1975 Richter spent a sabbatical year at CERN where he worked on the ISR experiment R702. In 1987, Richter received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. Richter was a member of the JASON advisory group and served on the board of directors of Scientists and Engineers for America, an organization focused on promoting sound science in American government. In May 2007, he visited Iran and Sharif University of Technology. Richter is one of the 20 American recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics to sign a letter addressed to President George W. Bush in May of 2008, urging him to \\"reverse the damage done to basic science research in the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill\\" by requesting additional emergency funding for the Department of Energy‚Äôs Office of Science, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. In 2012, President Barack Obama announced that Burton Richter was a co-recipient of the Enrico Fermi Award, along with Mildred Dresselhaus. In 2014, President Obama also awarded Richter the 2012 National Medal of Science. His citation read, \\"For pioneering contributions to the development of electron accelerators, including circular and linear colliders, synchrotron light sources, and for discoveries in elementary particle physics and contributions to energy policy.\\" In 2013, Richter commented on an open letter from Tom Wigley, Kerry Emanuel, Ken Caldeira, and James Hansen, that Angela Merkel was \\"wrong to shut down nuclear\\". In 2014, Richter was among the residents of a continuing care retirement center who filed an unsuccessful lawsuit against a continuing care retirement home's financial practices.

Hazels have simple, rounded leaves with double-serrate margins. The flowers are produced very early in spring before the leaves, and are monoecious, with single-sex catkins. The male catkins are pale yellow and 5‚Äì12 cm long, and the female ones are very small and largely concealed in the buds, with only the bright-red, 1-to-3 mm-long styles visible. The fruits are nuts 1‚Äì2.5 cm long and 1‚Äì2 cm diameter, surrounded by an involucre (husk) which partly to fully encloses the nut. The shape and structure of the involucre, and also the growth habit (whether a tree or a suckering shrub), are important in the identification of the different species of hazel. The pollen of hazel species, which are often the cause for allergies in late winter or early spring, can be identified under magnification (600√ó) by their characteristic granular exines bearing three conspicuous pores. Species Corylus has 14‚Äì18 species. The circumscription of species in eastern Asia is disputed, with WCSP and the Flora of China differing in which taxa are accepted; within this region, only those taxa accepted by both sources are listed below.WCSP: CorylusFlora of China: CorylusFlora of North America: Corylus The species are grouped as follows: * Nut surrounded by a soft, leafy involucre, multiple- stemmed, suckering shrubs to 12 m tall ** Involucre short, about the same length as the nut *** Corylus americana ‚Äì American hazel, eastern North America *** Corylus avellana ‚Äì Common hazel, Europe and western Asia *** Corylus heterophylla ‚Äì Asian hazel, Asia *** Corylus yunnanensis ‚Äì Yunnan hazel, central and southern China ** Involucre long, twice the length of the nut or more, forming a 'beak' *** Corylus colchica ‚Äì Colchican filbert, Caucasus *** Corylus cornuta ‚Äì Beaked hazel, North America *** Corylus maxima ‚Äì Filbert, southeastern Europe and southwest Asia *** Corylus sieboldiana ‚Äì Asian beaked hazel, northeastern Asia and Japan (syn. C. mandshurica) * Nut surrounded by a stiff, spiny involucre, single-stemmed trees to 20‚Äì35 m tall ** Involucre moderately spiny and also with glandular hairs *** Corylus chinensis ‚Äì Chinese hazel, western China *** Corylus colurna ‚Äì Turkish hazel, southeastern Europe and Asia Minor *** Corylus fargesii ‚Äì Farges' hazel, western China *** Corylus jacquemontii ‚Äì Jacquemont's hazel, Himalaya *** Corylus wangii ‚Äì Wang's hazel, southwest China ** Involucre densely spiny, resembling a chestnut burr *** Corylus ferox ‚Äì Himalayan hazel, Himalaya, Tibet and southwest China (syn. C. tibetica). Several hybrids exist, and can occur between species in different sections of the genus, e.g. Corylus √ó colurnoides (C. avellana √ó C. colurna). The oldest confirmed hazel species is Corylus johnsonii found as fossils in the Ypresian-age rocks of Ferry County, Washington. Uses Hazel coppice in winter at Bubbenhall in Warwickshire, England The nuts of all hazels are edible (see hazelnut). The common hazel is the species most extensively grown for its nuts, followed in importance by the filbert. Nuts are also harvested from the other species, but apart from the filbert, none is of significant commercial importance. A number of cultivars of the common hazel and filbert are grown as ornamental plants in gardens, including forms with contorted stems (C. avellana 'Contorta', popularly known as \\"Corkscrew hazel\\" or \\"Harry Lauder's walking stick\\" from its gnarled appearance); with weeping branches (C. avellana 'Pendula'); and with purple leaves (C. maxima 'Purpurea'). Hazel is a traditional material used for making wattle, withy fencing, baskets, and the frames of coracle boats. The tree can be coppiced, and regenerating shoots allow for harvests every few years. Hazels are used as food plants by the larvae of various species of Lepidoptera. Ecology At least 21 species of fungus have a mutualistic relationship with hazel. Lactarius pyrogalus grows almost exclusively on hazel, and hazel is one of two kinds of host for the rare Hypocreposis rhododrendri. Several rare species of Graphidion lichen depend on hazel trees. In the UK, five species of moth are specialised to feed on hazel including Parornix devoniella. Animals which eat hazelnuts include red deer, dormouse and red squirrel.Trees for Life - Hazel Mythology and folklore The Celts believed hazelnuts gave one wisdom and inspiration. There are numerous variations on an ancient tale that nine hazel trees grew around a sacred pool, dropping into the water nuts that were eaten by salmon (a fish sacred to Druids), which absorbed the wisdom. A Druid teacher, in his bid to become omniscient, caught one of these special salmon and asked a student to cook the fish, but not to eat it. While he was cooking it, a blister formed and the pupil used his thumb to burst it, which he naturally sucked to cool, thereby absorbing the fish's wisdom. This boy was called Fionn Mac Cumhail (Fin McCool) and went on to become one of the most heroic leaders in Gaelic mythology.Floriz: Mythology and Folklore of the Hazel Tree \\"The Hazel Branch\\" from Grimms' Fairy Tales claims that hazel branches offer the greatest protection from snakes and other things that creep on the earth.

He is sometimes known as the \\"father of the Texas Panhandle.\\" Essayist and historian J. Frank Dobie said that Goodnight \\"approached greatness more nearly than any other cowman of history.\\" In 1955, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum. Early years Goodnight was born in Macoupin County, Illinois, northeast of St. Louis, the fourth child of Charles Goodnight and the former Charlotte Collier. Goodnight's father's grave is located in a pasture south of Bunker Hill, Illinois. Goodnight moved to Texas in 1846 with his mother and stepfather, Hiram Daugherty. In 1856, he became a cowboy and served with the local militia, fighting against Comanche raiders. A year later, in 1857, Goodnight joined the Texas Rangers. Goodnight is also known for raising and leading a posse against the Comanche in 1860 that located the Indian camp where Cynthia Ann Parker was living with her husband, Peta Nocona, then guiding Texas Rangers to the camp, leading to Cynthia Ann's recapture.S.C. Gwynne, Empire of the Summer Moon. New York: Scribner, 2010, pp. 173-175. He later made a treaty with her son, Quanah Parker. His father owned a ranch that expanded to 500 acres. At the outbreak of the Civil War, he joined the Confederate States Army. Most of his time was spent as part of a frontier regiment guarding against raids by Indians. Goodnight described what it took to become a scout, \\"First, he must be born a natural woodsman and have the faculty of never needing a compass except in snow storms or darkness.\\"Goodnight, C., The Making of a Scout, manuscript, Panhandle Plains Historical Museum, Canyon, Texas  Cattle  The 2,000-mile Goodnight-Loving Trail extended from the Texas Panhandle and into Colorado as it headed north into Wyoming. Charles Goodnight statue outside of the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum at the West Texas A&M; University campus Following the war, he became involved in the herding of feral Texas Longhorn cattle northward from West Texas to railroads. This \\"making the gather\\" was a near-statewide round-up of cattle that had roamed free during the four long years of war. In 1866, Oliver Loving and he drove their first herd of cattle northward along what would become known as the Goodnight-Loving Trail. Early in the partnership with Loving, they pastured cattle at such sites as Capulin Mountain in northeastern New Mexico. Goodnight invented the chuckwagon, which was first used on the initial cattle drive. Upon arriving in New Mexico, they formed a partnership with New Mexico cattleman John Chisum for future contracts to supply the United States Army with cattle. After Loving's death, Goodnight and Chisum extended the trail from New Mexico to Colorado, and eventually to Wyoming. The Goodnight-Loving Trail extended from Belknap, Texas, to Fort Sumner, New Mexico. Goodnight and Loving were close friends. Goodnight sat by Loving's bed during the two weeks the latter took to die, and reportedly kept a photograph of Loving in his pocket long after his death, and later put a photograph on his desk. As requested by the dying Loving, Goodnight carried the body from New Mexico to Weatherford in Parker County for burial. To take advantage of available grass, timber, water, and game, he founded in 1876 what was to become the first Texas Panhandle ranch, the JA Ranch, in the Palo Duro Canyon of the Texas Panhandle. He partnered with the Irish businessman John George Adair to create the JA, which stands for \\"John Adair\\". In 1880, Goodnight was a founder of the Panhandle Stockman's Association. The organization sought to improve cattle-breeding methods and to reduce the threat of rustlers and outlaws. After Adair's death in 1885, Goodnight worked in partnership for a time with Adair's widow Cornelia Wadsworth Ritchie Adair. He also developed an acquaintanceship with W. D. Twichell, who lived in Amarillo from 1890 to 1918, and surveyed 165 of the 254 Texas counties. After Goodnight had already left the JA, Tom Blasingame came to the ranch in 1918. Blasingame worked there most of the next 73 years, having, at the time of his death in 1989, become the oldest cowboy in the history of the American West. Bison In addition to raising cattle 1876, the Goodnights preserved a herd of native plains bison that year, which is said to survive to this day in Caprock Canyons State Park. The herd in Caprock Canyons was actually donated by JA Ranch and no documentation demonstrates that this was the herd preserved by the Goodnights. Bison of this herd were introduced into the Yellowstone National Park in 1902 and into the larger zoos and ranches throughout the nation. He also crossbred the bison with domestic cattle, which he called cattalo. Charles \\"Buffalo\\" Jones, a co-founder of Garden City, Kansas, after meeting with Goodnight in Texas, also bred cattalo, or beefalo, on a ranch near Grand Canyon National Park in northern Arizona. Personal life On July 26, 1870, Goodnight married Mary Ann \\"Molly\\" Dyer, a teacher from Weatherford, west of Fort Worth. Goodnight developed a practical sidesaddle for Molly. Though he was not of his wife's denomination, Goodnight donated money to build a Methodist church in Goodnight. Molly and he also established the Goodnight Academy to offer postelementary education to hundreds of children of ranchers. In his younger years, Goodnight smoked some 30 cigars per day but switched to a pipe in his mature years. He never learned to read or write but had his wives write letters for him to various individuals, including Quanah Parker. During his last illness, he gave his gold Hampton pocket watch to his pastor, Ralph Blackburn. After he mastered ranching, Goodnight was involved in other activities, including the establishment of his Goodnight College in Armstrong County and working as a newspaperman and a banker. He lost his life's savings when the Mexican silver mine he invested in was nationalized by the Mexican government. He was forced to sell his ranch in 1919 to an oilman friend, W. J. McAlister, with the provision that Goodnight and his then first wife could stay in the home until they both died. After Molly died in April 1926, Goodnight became ill himself. He was nursed back to health by a distant paternal cousin, 26-year-old nurse and telegraph operator from Butte, Montana, named Corinne Goodnight, with whom Charles had been corresponding because of their shared surname. On March 5, 1927, his 91st birthday, Goodnight married Corinne, who was young enough to be his great-granddaughter and who soon miscarried their unborn child. Her name was hence Corinne Goodnight Goodnight. He joined her Two by Twos church and was baptized a few months before his death in his winter home in Phoenix, Arizona. Evetts Haley had described Goodnight as \\"deeply religious and reverential by nature.\\"Charles Goodnight exhibit, Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum, Canyon, Texas He is buried next to his first wife, Mary Ann, in the Goodnight Cemetery near Amarillo.Texas Plains Trail Goodnight house restoration  Charles Goodnight ranch house The Charles and Mary Ann (Molly) Goodnight Ranch House is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Goodnight home is located one-quarter mile south of U.S. Highway 287 about 40 miles east of Amarillo. The home was renovated by the Armstrong County Museum from 2006 to 2012. The structure was painted to resemble its appearance in 1887. The interior was restored based on research into the original paint and wallpapers used. In 2005, Amarillo businessman Brent Caviness and a partner donated the home and 30 acres. Mary Ann Goodnight taught children in the bunkhouse. The cowboys slept there at night, and she moved their things aside for school during the day, Goodin said. The house had electricity and sheltered hundreds of ranch workers and cowboys over the years. Beginning in 2006, the Armstrong County Museum in Claude started raising money to restore the structure and make it the centerpiece of the Charles Goodnight Historical Center. Nearly $1.8 million were raised, but another $600,000 are needed. Funds were contributed by several Amarillo-area philanthropies, as well as fund-raisers from the Texas Historical Foundation. The first phase of the restoration, which included work on the foundation, porches, roof, and exterior paint, has been completed. Goodin said that the next step will include interior painting and wallpapering. A small rope bed built by Adam Sheek, Goodnight's second stepfather, a minister and a furniture maker, will be placed in the house upon renovation. Ruth Robinson of Clarendon, the seat of Donley County, who is a great-great-niece of Goodnight's, donated the bed, as well as her mother's Victorian bedroom suite. The house was scheduled to open in April 2013. Reputation Charles Goodnight letter on his stationery Montie Goodin, a member of the museum board who was born in the Goodnight house in 1931, two years after Goodnight's death, said that Goodnight had no concept of his own importance: \\"It didn't matter who you were, he invited all in.\\" Goodnight is presented as a good and decent man. J. Frank Dobie, who knew Goodnight, is quoted in Charles Goodnight: Father of the Texas Panhandle as having said: \\"I have met a lot of good men, several fine gentlemen, hordes of cunning climbers, plenty of loud-braying asses and plenty of dumb oxen, but I haven't lived long enough or traveled far enough to meet more than two or three men I'd call great. This is a word I will not bandy around. To me, Charles Goodnight was great-natured.\\" Other views have been expressed. In Time-Life's 1973 publication The Cowboys, the author states (p. 62): \\"Goodnight was no better than the rest. Once when his wife expressed shock at some vigilante hangings ('I understand', she exclaimed, 'they hanged them to a telegraph pole!') Charlie replied quietly, 'Well, I don't think it hurt the telegraph pole.' What she didn't know was that the victims had actually been strung up with Goodnight's full approval.\\" The men hanged were caught in the act of murder and cattle rustling. The western-themed sculptor Grant Speed's depiction of Goodnight is housed in the Square House Museum in the city of Panhandle. In 2010, another of Speed's sculptures of Goodnight sold at auction for $5,400. In literature In 1935, six years after Goodnight's death, Laura Vernon Hamner, who knew Charles and Molly Goodnight from her time in Claude in Armstrong County, Texas, published a fictionalized biography of the cattleman entitled, The No-Gun Man of Texas. The western novelist Matt Braun's novel Texas Empire is based on the life of Goodnight and fictionalizes the founding of the JA Ranch. The Goodnight Trail is the name of a novel by Ralph Compton. Similarly, Mari Sandoz's Old Jules Country in the part \\"Some dedicated men\\" relates the difficulties of Goodnight's cattle drives to Colorado.Mari Sandoz, Old Jules Country, pp. 171‚Äì175 In James A. Michener's novel, Centennial, the Skimmerhorn Trail is based on the actual Goodnight- Loving Trail. In addition, his name is mentioned in the novel; the character R. J. Poteet appears to have been based on Goodnight. All four of Larry McMurtry's Lonesome Dove series novels include brief appearances by Goodnight. His appearance in the prequel Dead Man's Walk is historically inaccurate. The story takes place during the Santa Fe Expedition of 1841, when Goodnight would have been only five years old. Further, Lonesome Dove is a fictionalized account of Goodnight and Loving's third cattle drive. Woodrow F. Call represents Goodnight, Augustus McCrae is Oliver Loving. Though the characters have personalities rather different from their real-life counterparts, the novel borrows heavily from actual events, in particular Loving's ambush by Indians and Goodnight's attentive care as Loving died from an arrow-induced infection. Call returns McCrae's body to Texas, just as Goodnight returned Loving for burial in Weatherford. The marker that Call carves for Deets is based on an epitaph Charles Goodnight created for Bose Ikard, an ex-slave who worked alongside Goodnight most of his life. He also plays his largest role in the final volume, Streets of Laredo. He is played in the miniseries Dead Man's Walk by Chris Penn, in Comanche Moon by Jeremy Ratchford, and in Streets of Laredo by James Gammon. Historians John Milton Price (born 1942) of Northwestern State University in Natchitoches, Louisiana, and Byron Price (born 1949), the director of the Charles M. Russell Center at the University of Oklahoma at Norman, will compile a book on Goodnight's life. Entitled The Charles Goodnight Papers, the three-volume work will be published by the University of Oklahoma Press, of which Byron Price is also the director. In November 2013, the two professors received a $50,000 grant from the Summerlee Foundation in Dallas to assist in the Goodnight project. John Price explains, \\"Our endeavor is an important addition to the historiography of the American West. It is a work of original source materials, photographs, letters, and documents ‚Äì the lifeblood of this most important keystone of Western Americana.\\" John Price added that the study will focus on the last three years of Goodnight's life, which have been given little attention in other works. In popular culture The song \\"The Goodnight-Loving Trail\\" by Utah Phillips describes a chuckwagon cook on a cattle drive. The West Texas songwriter Andy Wilkinson wrote \\"Charlie Goodnight: His Life in Poetry and Song\\". The CD was produced by Lloyd Maines of Lubbock. Albertan Ian Tyson of Alberta, Canada, wrote a song \\"Charles Goodnight's Grave\\", about leaving bandannas near the Goodnight grave. Singer Guy Clark's song about Texas, \\"Red River\\", includes the line \\"Here's to Charlie Goodnight, and Mr. Loving too, and here's to Coronado, the Comanche and the Blues, and here's to the bootleggers, and the oilfield crews, and here's to one and all of us Red River fools.\\" The actor Jack Mather played Goodnight in the episode, \\"Old Blue\\", of the syndicated television anthology series, Death Valley Days, hosted by Stanley Andrews. The episode focuses on Goodnight's lead steer, Old Blue, who is stolen and thereafter adopted as a family pet.

Hagan published Charles Goodnight: Father of the Texas Panhandle through the University of Oklahoma Press in Norman. Hagan's short biography, only 147 pages, is the first to re-examine Goodnight's life in some 75 years. He examines Goodnight's friendship with his two great friends, Oliver Loving and Oliver H. Nelson, as well as the clash over grasslands with Temple Lea Houston, youngest son of Sam Houston. Hagan describes Goodnight as a \\"demanding boss, approach[ing] every task himself with all the energy he could muster, and he expected the same ... from those under his direction.\\" Whatever tasks were pending, Goodnight thought that he was able to do it better than his hands, and usually could.\\" In his last years, Goodnight still tried to finish all work that day, rather than postponing the less critical activities to maximize his declining physical energy.Billy Hathorn, \\"Review of Charles Goodnight: Father of the Texas Panhandle\\", West Texas Historical Review, Vol. 89 (2013), pp. 195-196 Though Goodnight had a profane tongue and consumed liquor moderately on occasion, he would fire any hand caught drinking, gambling, or fighting. Any abuse of horses also met with Goodnight's stern disapproval. Hagan examines the partnership between Goodnight and Loving and then with John George Adair, an arrangement that succeeded probably because the two strong-willed men were rarely in each other's company. Paraphrasing J. Frank Dobie, Hagan explains the basis of Goodnight's wealth. A steer of 800 pounds brought $64 in Kansas but barely $10 in Texas. So, a herd of 750 animals would net more than $40,000, a large return in the 1870s before the inflation of currency and the federal income tax. Goodnight's invention of the chuckwagon, the original version drawn by 20 oxen and carrying provisions for 18 men for a 600-mile drive. Despite his dominant role in Panhandle history, the aging Goodnight fell upon declining health and financial reverses. He dabbled in a failed venture to produce a Western film and proved unable to make needed investments for his later years. Adair's widow, Cornelia, said that Goodnight lacked business savvy. Shut out in his last years from his beloved Palo Duro Canyon, Goodnight reflected in his old age: \\"Taken all in all, my life on the trail was the happiest part of it.\\" The functionally illiterate He left behind his personal story and ranch artifacts to the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum in Canyon, Texas.

History  Aero Spacelines was formed with only one customer in mind ‚Äî the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. NASA required a way to transport outsize cargo from their various manufacturing plants, such as the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, Louisiana, to Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. These freight shipments were too large to be safely transported by rail or truck. Shipping by sea was too time consuming, expensive, and fraught with the danger of damaging the cargo on turbulent seas. The only viable means of transporting NASA's cargo was by air. However, due to the large size of the components, no existing aircraft was capable of accomplishing the task. John M. \\"Jack\\" Conroy, a retired United States Air Force pilot, and Lee Mansdorf, an aircraft salesman and entrepreneur, formulated the Guppy concept one evening over dinner. It was decided a company needed to be established to manufacture outsized aircraft. Conroy hired Robert W. Lillibridge as vice president of manufacturing and engineering, and a team was assembled for the project. Financing was provided by venture capitalist William Ballon, a World War II combat veteran also from the Army Air Corps. Once the company was established at Van Nuys Airport, California, Aero Spacelines began operation in 1960 to engineer the transformation of the Boeing 377 airliner into the Pregnant Guppy.Mondey, p. 9 Among the earliest of NASA's shipments utilizing the Pregnant Guppy were the first and second stages of the Project Gemini's Titan II GVL from the Martin Co. in Baltimore, Maryland, to Cape Canaveral, Florida. Subsequent versions of the Guppy series transported the S-IVB, the third stage of the Saturn booster from California to Florida. In 1967, Aero Spacelines encountered financial difficulties and was acquired by Unexcelled Inc. That corporation was sold to Tracor Aviation. Jack Conroy organized a new company, Conroy Aircraft, which built more airplanes for transporting oversized cargo. By November 1968, NASA had paid Aero Spacelines $11,591,633 in contracts.https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/notes.htm#10.37 Conroy ceased operations in 1972. As of November 2019, one Super Guppy was still in operation. NASA utilizes it to transport its vehicles as needed, and leases it to third parties when not in use. In early 2016, NASA used that aircraft to transport the main structure of Orion crew capsule, from its Michoud Manufacturing Facility in New Orleans, Louisiana, to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, where the capsule will undergo its first uncrewed test flight aboard the Space Launch System rocket. In November 2019 NASA used the aircraft to transport the Orion capsule from the Kennedy Space Center to the Mansfield Lahm Airport in Ohio for thermal and vacuum tests.https://www.nasa.gov/feature/glenn/2019/orion-spacecraft-arrives-in- ohio-aboard-the-super-guppy List of aircraft Aero Spacelines produced three Guppy aircraft models while it was in business. *Pregnant Guppy (1962) - 1 built *Super Guppy (1965) - 5 built *Mini Guppy (1967) - 2 built See also *Airbus Beluga *Boeing Dreamlifter *Conroy Skymonster References External links * Pregnant Guppy : THE PLANE THAT WON THE SPACE RACE Bloom, Margy.

They were armed with 4.2 in (107 mm) chemical mortars. For this reason they were also called the \\"Four- deucers\\".http://www.olive-drab.com/od_infweapons_mortars_heavy.php \\"Four- deucers\\" Chemical mortar battalions Originally, chemical mortar battalions consisted of a headquarters company and four mortar companies. In 1943, this \\"square\\" organization was modified to three mortar companies for a better fit with the three infantry regiments of the \\"triangular\\" infantry divisions. Per Table of Organization and Equipment 3-25 of 29 September 1944, a typical chemical mortar battalion had an establishment of 37 officers, 138 NCOs and 481 junior enlisted men not counting the attached medical detachment. It consisted of: * 1 chemical mortar battalion headquarters company, containing: ** 1 company headquarters section (4 officers, 4 noncommissioned officers, and 14 junior enlisted men) ** 1 battalion headquarters section (5 officers, 6 noncommissioned officers, and 20 junior enlisted men ** 1 maintenance section (1 officer, 2 noncommissioned officers, and 6 junior enlisted men) ** 3 ammunition sections (each of 2 noncommissioned officers and 29 junior enlisted men) * 3 chemical mortar companies * Attached medical detachment (1 officer, 1 noncommissioned officer, and 13 junior enlisted men) A chemical mortar company usually had an establishment of 9 officers, 40 noncommissioned officers and 118 junior enlisted men. It consisted of: * 1 chemical mortar company headquarters section (three officers, seven noncommissioned officers, and 28 junior enlisted men) * 3 mortar platoons A mortar platoon consisted of: * One platoon headquarters (two officers, three noncommissioned officers, and six junior enlisted men) * Four mortar squads, each of which had one squad leader, (noncommissioned officer) one gunner, (noncommissioned officer) one assistant gunner, (junior enlisted man) three ammunition bearers, (junior enlisted men) and two truck drivers (junior enlisted men) http://www.100thww2.org/support/cm/cmorg.html Organization Chemical mortar battalions were not assigned as integral parts of divisions or other units. As other units went into combat, chemical mortar battalions were attached to them as support. In 1943, General Mark Clark's Fifth Army established a policy that no infantry division would be committed to combat without a chemical mortar battalion attached. As a result, when infantry units were rotated out of combat, the mortar battalions often stayed in the line and were attached to the fresh infantry unit. Chemical mortars were in such high demand that often the companies of a battalion would be split up and assigned to different divisions. Two Fifth Army antiaircraft battalions were retrained as chemical mortar battalions (99th and 100th) On the first day that General George Patton's Third Army became operational, in the summer of 1944, he issued a standing order to his staff that no infantry division would be committed to combat without a chemical mortar battalion attached, and no infantry regiment would be committed without a mortar company attached.http://www.history.army.mil/reference/normandy/TS/CWS/CWS12.htm European Theater of Operations Battalion numbering During World War II, 25 chemical mortar battalions were sent overseas: * the 2nd and 3rd Battalions * the 71st and 72nd Battalions * the 80th to 100th Battalions Seven additional battalions (the 443rd, 483rd, 534th, 537th, 560th, 781st and 782nd) were converted from field artillery battalions during the war, but were activated too late to serve overseas. After World War II, the U.S. War Department transferred the operations and development of chemical mortars to the Ordnance Department, in this way making the mortar an official infantry weapon. The 2nd Chemical Mortar Battalion was the last of the chemical mortar battalions; and the only one to see combat after World War II. It was reactivated in 1949 and saw 1,008 days of combat during the Korean War. In January 1953, its combat personnel were transferred to the 461st Infantry Battalion (Heavy Mortar.)http://www.4point2.org/#Chemical%20Mortar%20Battalions Chemical mortars Chemical mortars are so named because of their capability of firing not only high explosive, but also chemical, gas, incendiary and smoke marker shells. Chemical shells were on standby during World War II, to be used in retaliation should the enemy employ chemical weapons first. These same mortars, using high-explosive shells, came to be acknowledged by U.S. Army commanders and personnel as being one of the most effective means of quickly striking at stationary targets, such as machine gun nests, prepared strongpoints, pillboxes and even German artillery positions. Other advantages chemical mortars offered compared to full-sized artillery pieces were their maneuverability, along with easy assembly, disassembly and reassembly. The mortars, due to their relatively small size, were able to fire high explosive shells from concealed positions, such as natural escarpments on hillsides, or from woods. The rifled barrel gave the mortar remarkable accuracy; fire was often called on targets within fifty yards of friendly positions. The low- velocity shells were totally silent in transit and gave no warning of their powerful explosions (the M2 mortar's M3 high explosive shell contained 3.64 kilograms of explosives, placing it midway between the 2.18 kilograms of the 105 mm howitzer M2A1's M1 shell and the 6.88 kilograms of the 155 mm howitzer M1's M102 shell), which tended to create panic among enemy forces who were unexpectedly subjected to their firepower. The mortar was called the \\"grass- cutter\\" by German troops because its high explosive shell exploded and fragmented just a few inches above ground level. The mortars often fired white phosphorus munitions (WP) shells to block enemy observation with smoke; white phosphorus also caused casualties and fires, being especially effective against dug-in troops because the burning particles arced upward and fell directly down into foxholes.History of the 4.2\\" Chemical Mortar The development and capabilities of the chemical mortar The 4.2 in (107 mm) chemical mortar was developed from the British World War I-era 4 inch (101.6 mm) Stokes mortar. The Stokes mortar could fire twenty shells per minute and had a range of 1,100 yards (1,006 m) and in this way was capable of overwhelming enemy trenches. The American-built M1 4.2 inch (107 mm) mortar, first introduced in 1924, had a rifled barrel and a range of 2,300 yards. By the 1930s, after modifying the bore, improving the two-legged support and the recoil mechanism, and producing barrels made of seamless nickel steel, the M1A1 model was capable of sending shells 2,400 yards (2,195 m) By 1942, after authorization had been sought and granted to use high-explosive shells, the new M2 model was produced with a stronger barrel. History In 1935, the 2nd Chemical Mortar Battalion was established at Edgewood Arsenal Maryland with the chemical mortar as its primary weapon. At the onset of World War II, there were a few other mortar battalions and companies, including one that was lost on Bataan in the Philippines. In 1942, General George Marshall ordered the formation of five additional chemical mortar battalions equipped with the mortar (the 3rd, and the 81st through 84th) Later, the mortar was developed to be capable of instantly firing shells from a mere 565 yards (517 m) at minimum propellant charge, to a range of 4,400 yards (4,023 m) by having propellant- charge disks of powder added that by then were being manufactured as square disks with a hole in the middle, strung together, fitted into cartridges and sewn together into bundles of various thickness. Its rate of fire was 40 rounds in the first two minutes, 100 rounds in the first 20 minutes and thereafter a sustained rate of 80 rounds per hour. These variations were caused by the stresses and strains on the barrels and the rest of firing mechanisms that were being imposed by different firing conditions. The mortars were transported in 3/4 ton trucks or on hand carts, in island engagements in the Pacific by boat, and in difficult terrain by mule. During the Allied invasion of Sicily in the summer of 1943 - the first time the mortar was used in wartime - 35,000 rounds were fired in 38 days, of which more than 90% were high explosive.

Ardbraccan House (known sometimes historically as Ardbraccan Palace) is a large Palladian country house in County Meath, Ireland. The historic house served from the 1770s to 1885 as the residence of the Church of Ireland Lord Bishop of Meath. Construction Ardbraccan itself had been the location of the residence of a bishop for over one thousand years, first of the Bishop of Ardbraccan and, later, following the merger of many small dioceses into the Diocese of Meath, as the residence of the Bishop of Meath. By the Middle Ages a large Tudor house, containing its own church, known as St. Mary's, stood on the site. However, in 1734, Bishop Arthur Price (1678-1752) decided to replace the decaying mansion with a new Georgian residence. Initially the two wings of the house were built, before the main four-bay two-storey block of the house was completed in the 1770s by Bishop Maxwell. It was partly designed by the acclaimed 18th-century German architect Richard Castle (also known as Richard Cassels), who was the architect of many notable Irish buildings including Leinster House in Dublin. =Controversy/legend= Legend suggested that gravestones from a neighbouring Roman Catholic cemetery at Markiestown, some miles away, were removed and used as the steps into the servants' quarters in the residence. Whether that was an urban myth based on the intense rivalry between the state-established Church of Ireland and the local predominantly Roman Catholic population in Bohermeen (who were subject to the discriminatory Penal Laws and forced to pay tithes to the Church of Ireland) or had some basis in fact, is unclear. It is possible that the house utilised stone from the derelict pre-Reformation church at the cemetery, though it was notable that from the mid to late eighteenth century the cemetery was denuded of all gravestones. Sale The new bishop's palace became famous for its architecture. Funded by government grants and locally paid tithes, the Church of Ireland bishop held court from the mansion, which was the centre of a large agricultural demesne. However the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland in 1871, following the previous scrapping of Roman Catholic-paid tithes, fatally weakened the economic survival of the bishop's estate, which was left totally reliant on the small local Church of Ireland community, and in 1885 the bishop sold the estate and house, moving to a more suitable smaller mansion nearby. Ardbraccan House was bought by the eldest son of Hugh Law, a former Lord Chancellor of Ireland, and remained in the ownership of his descendants until sold by Colonel Owen Foster in 1985 to Tara Mines, who used it as a guest residence for visiting businessmen. Today In the late 1990s, the house was bought by David Maher who invested large sums to completely restore the mansion. In 2002 the restoration of Ardbraccan House won An Taisce's Best Restoration of a Private Building award, and it was opened to the public. In the early 2000s, the (Meath) planning authority approved controversial plans to build a major new motorway linking (clonee) and Kells, County Meath(Kells) through part of the house's historic demesne. The Irish Georgian Society and environmentalists criticised the proposal. The M3 motorway eventually opened in 2010. In 2013 the property was sold to Charles Noell.https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/homes-and- property/2.1233/us-buyer-snaps-up-meath-estate-for-4-9m-1.1386140 See also * List of buildings in Ireland References Category:Buildings and structures in County Meath Category:Houses in the Republic of Ireland ","title":"Ardbraccan House"},{"id":"396694","text":"Philip Warren Anderson (December 13, 1923 ‚Äì March 29, 2020) was an American theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate. Anderson made contributions to the theories of localization, antiferromagnetism, symmetry breaking (including a paper in 1962 discussing symmetry breaking in particle physics, leading to the development of the Standard Model around 10 years later), and high-temperature superconductivity, and to the philosophy of science through his writings on emergent phenomena.Horgan, J. (1994) Profile: Philip W. Anderson ‚Äì Gruff Guru of Condensed Matter Physics, Scientific American 271(5), 34-35. Education and early life Anderson was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, and grew up in Urbana, Illinois. He graduated from University Laboratory High School in Urbana in 1940. Afterwards, he went to Harvard University for undergraduate and graduate work, with a wartime stint at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory in between. As an undergraduate, his close associates included particle- nuclear physicist H. Pierre Noyes, philosopher and historian of science Thomas Kuhn and molecular physicist Henry Silsbee. In graduate school, he studied under John Hasbrouck van Vleck, with whom he would later receive the Nobel Prize in physics. Career and research From 1949 to 1984, Anderson was employed by Bell Laboratories in New Jersey, where he worked on a wide variety of problems in condensed matter physics. During this period he developed what is now called Anderson localization (the idea that extended states can be localized by the presence of disorder in a system) and Anderson's theorem (concerning impurity scattering in superconductors); invented the Anderson Hamiltonian, which describes the site-wise interaction of electrons in a transition metal; proposed symmetry breaking within particle physics (this played a role in the development of the Standard Model and the development of the theory behind the Higgs mechanism, which in turn generates mass in some elementary particles); created the pseudospin approach to the BCS theory of superconductivity; made seminal studies of non-s-wave pairing (both symmetry- breaking and microscopic mechanism) in the superfluidity of He3, and helped found the area of spin-glasses. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1963. From 1967 to 1975, Anderson was a professor of theoretical physics at Cambridge University. In 1977 Anderson was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his investigations into the electronic structure of magnetic and disordered systems, which allowed for the development of electronic switching and memory devices in computers. Co- researchers Sir Nevill Francis Mott and John van Vleck shared the award with him. In 1982, he was awarded the National Medal of Science. He retired from Bell Labs in 1984 and was Joseph Henry Professor Emeritus of Physics at Princeton University. Anderson's writings included Concepts in Solids, Basic Notions of Condensed Matter Physics and The Theory of Superconductivity in the High-Tc Cuprates. Anderson served on the board of advisors of Scientists and Engineers for America, an organization focused on promoting sound science in American government. In response to the discovery of high-temperature superconductors in 1980s, Anderson proposed Resonating valence bond (RVB) theory to explain the phenomenon. While many found the idea unconvincing, RVB theory proved instrumental in the study of spin liquids. Anderson also made conceptual contributions to the philosophy of science through his explication of emergent phenomena, which became an inspiration for the science of complex systems. In 1972 he wrote an article called \\"More is Different\\" in which he emphasized the limitations of reductionism and the existence of hierarchical levels of science, each of which requires its own fundamental principles for advancement. In 1984 he participated in the founding workshops of the Santa Fe Institute, a multidisciplinary research institute dedicated to the science of complex systems. Anderson also co-chaired the institute's 1987 conference on economics with Kenneth Arrow and W. Brian Arthur, and participated in its 2007 workshop on models of emergent behavior in complex systems. A 2006 statistical analysis of scientific research papers by Jos√© Soler, comparing the number of references in a paper to the number of citations, declared Anderson to be the \\"most creative\\" amongst ten most cited physicists in the world. Awards and honors He was awarded the Oliver E. Buckley Condensed Matter Prize in 1964, the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1977, the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1978, and was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1980. He was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1982. Personal life Anderson was an atheist and was one of 22 Nobel Laureates who signed the Humanist Manifesto. Anderson was also interested in Japanese culture, living there for a time and becoming a 1st Dan master of the board game Go. The Nihon Ki-in awarded him a lifetime achievement award in 2007, and Anderson joked that there were only four people in Japan who could beat him. He died in Princeton, New Jersey, on March 29, 2020, at the age of 96.  Publications  = Books =   * = Journal articles = * Pdf. * Pdf. * Pdf. * Pdf. * Pdf. * Pdf.  * Pdf.

He was half of the hip hop duo Gang Starr‚Äîalongside the rapper Guru‚Äîand presently forms half of the hip hop duo PRhyme, together with Royce da 5'9\\". He is considered one of the greatest hip hop producers of all time.  Early life  Christopher Edward Martin was born in the Fifth Ward of Houston, Texas on March 21, 1966. He was then raised in Prairie View, Texas, before moving to Brooklyn, New York, during his teenage years. He attended Prairie View A&M; University, where he honed his musical skills as the campus DJ, and he also occasionally performed with the Marching Storm band.  Musical career  DJ Premier in 1999 Premier is known for producing all of Gang Starr's songs as well as many of those composed by the Gang Starr Foundation. Notable artists he has worked with include Anderson .Paak, AZ, Big Daddy Kane, Big L, Blaq Poet, Bun B, Canibus, Christina Aguilera, Common, D'Angelo, Dilated Peoples, D.I.T.C., Dr. Dre, Fat Joe, The Game, Ill Bill, Janet Jackson, Jay-Z, Joey Bada$$, Kanye West, KRS-One, The Lady of Rage, Limp Bizkit, Lord Finesse, The LOX, Ludacris, Mac Miller, Mobb Deep, M.O.P., Mos Def, Nas, The Notorious B.I.G., O.C., Papoose, Rakim, Royce da 5'9\\", Snoop Dogg, Xzibit and more. Premier collaborated with MC Jeru the Damaja on the album The Sun Rises in the East, released in 1994, as well as the 1996 follow-up, Wrath of the Math. Premier produced and supervised Livin' Proof by Group Home, also from the Gang Starr Foundation; although overlooked at the time of its 1995 release, the album eventually received acclaim. In 2006, pop/R&B; singer Christina Aguilera recruited Premier to produce her album Back to Basics. Premier explained the reservations he heard from people regarding the collaboration: > When Christina [Aguilera] had me work with her, people were like, \\"Oh no. > Please don‚Äôt.\\" Then when they heard \\"Ain‚Äôt No Other Man,\\" \\"Back In The Day,\\" > and all the other records were still constructed like Premier tracks they > were like, \\"Yo, I really love this album.

I want to > be attached to music‚Äîcountry, rap, soul, jazz, blues, it doesn‚Äôt matter, > gospel music‚ÄîI come from all of that. In 2008, Premier appeared in Grand Theft Auto IV as himself - the host for radio station The Classics 104.1. Premier produced the majority of Blaq Poet's Tha Blaqprint, which was released in mid-2009. Premier contributed a song on Game's 2011 album, The R.E.D. Album. Also in 2011, Premier appeared on the song \\"Gangster\\", on Bushido's album Jenseits von Gut und B√∂se. Performing in Germany, 2001 Premier was one of the artists followed in the 2012 documentary, Re:GENERATION. The film followed his production of the song \\"Regeneration,\\" for which he used a live performance of his work by the Berklee Symphony Orchestra. In September 2012, Immortal Technique said that a song called \\"Born in the Trap,\\" on his upcoming album, titled The Middle Passage, would feature production by Premier. In early 2014, Premier revealed that he is working with Aguilera again in an interview with New Zealand's Rip It Up magazine. Premier produced Y'all Ready Know by Slaughterhouse, from the Shady Records album, Shady XV, and the music video was published in November 2014. In mid-2014, Premier collaborated with Korean hip-hop group Dynamic Duo on two singles \\"AEAO\\" and \\"Animal\\", which were both warmly received. A mid-January 2015 announcement from Premier stated that the producer's studio, D&D;, also known as \\"The HeadQcouterz,\\" will cease to be operational. As part of the announcement, Premier confirmed that he is working on the album, Last Session @320, after he relocates to a recording space in Astoria, New York City, U.S. DJ Premier hosts a weekly two-hour show, Live From HeadQCourterz, on Sirius Satellite Radio's Hip-Hop Nation. DJ Premier served as one of the three curators for the soundtrack to the video game NBA 2K16, alongside DJ Khaled and DJ Mustard.Makuch, Eddie (July 9, 2015). \\"NBA 2K16 Has 50+ Song Soundtrack Curated By DJ Khaled, DJ Premier, DJ Mustard\\". GameSpot. Retrieved April 16, 2016.  Collaborations  The early line-up of the Gang Starr Foundation in the mid-1990s included Jeru the Damaja, Group Home, Big Shug, and Gang Starr. Premier was fully responsible for the production of Jeru the Damaja's first two albums, The Sun Rises in the East and Wrath of the Math. Jeru released three subsequent albums that did not include Premier's involvement. In terms of his Group Home collaboration, Premier commented in a 2003 interview: \\"They [Group Home] don't respect what fed them.\\" He further explained that he only agreed to produce the track \\"The Legacy\\" because of Guru's involvement. Other artists closely tied to the Gang Starr Foundation who Premier collaborated with include: Afu Ra, Bahamadia, Krumbsnatcha, Big Shug, Smiley the Ghetto Child, and NYGz. Afu Ra explained Premier's influence in a September 2014 interview with the \\"Lyrically Fit\\" website: > Premier definitely coached me when I was in the booth. > \\"harder..stronger..more this..more that\\"‚ÄîI was an untamed artist and rapping > next to recording your vocals are different. He gave me this knowledge > through the work we did. Besides the Gang Starr Foundation, Premier is closely affiliated with M.O.P., which he names as one of his all-time favorite groups. The relationship started with the remix of ‚ÄúRugged, Neva Smoove‚Äù in 1994, a single from the group's first album, which also included the exclusive B-side ‚ÄúDowntown Swinga.‚Äù From then, Premier produced about one-third of the songs on each subsequent album and overseeing and mixing the projects. On M.O.P.'s 2009 Foundation album, Premier provided only one track, which was called \\"What I Wanna B.\\" On May 16, 2019, DJ Premier released a collaboration with Buffalo (New York) rappers Conway The Machine, Westside Gunn, and Benny the Butcher, called \\"Headlines.\\" In June 2020, DJ Premier produced a track for Public Enemy called \\"State of the Union (STFU)\\".https://pitchfork.com/news/public-enemy- share-new-song-state-of-the-union-stfu-listen/  Style and influences  DJ Premier in 2019 DJ Premier's style of production epitomizes the New York sound of his earlier peers. He is known for sampling jazz, funk, and soul artists, as well as sampling an artist's past work when creating a new track for that same artist. For example, on Jay-Z's \\"So Ghetto\\", from the 1999 album Vol. 3... Life and Times of S. Carter, Premier samples an older Jay-Z song, 1997's \\"Who You Wit II\\".Jay Z's So Ghetto sample of Jay-Z's Who You Wit II In addition, his encyclopedic memory of hip-hop lyrics allows him to distinctively speak with his hands by scratching in lyrics from several different songs to construct new phrases.Exclaim! Canada's Music Authority Premier's beats are known for his oft-imitated combinations of short vocal samples, often from multiple artists, to create a chorus. Premier has also experimented with atonal samples that are not confined to soul, jazz, and funk. For example, he sampled and chopped up seminal electro-acoustic music from the 1960s on the track ‚ÄúPhysical Stamina‚Äù by Jeru the Damaja. In an interview with XXL Magazine, DJ Premier was asked how his sound evolved, to which he replied, \\"Marley Marl is my number-one inspiration. Jam Master Jay, Mix Master Ice, and UTFO. Grandmaster D, and Whodini. DJ Cheese, Grandmaster Flash, Kool Herc, Afrika Bambaataa. Jazzy Jay‚Äîeven Cut Creator. Seeing them do what they do. It‚Äôs black music, it‚Äôs black culture, it comes from the ghetto. How can you not relate to ghetto people when that‚Äôs the rawest form of blackness? Even though it‚Äôs not a good place in regards to the economy and how bad people have it in the neighborhood, the realism‚Äôs there, and that‚Äôs what we were born out of. So I very much pay respect by doing the same type of music in return.\\" DJ Premier attended Prairie View A&M; University and may have been influenced by the musical atmosphere at the university while serving as the campus DJ and occasional performer with the world-famous Marching Storm band.  Business career  D&D; in 2000 As a businessman, DJ Premier has his own record company named Year Round Records. Among its artists are New York group NYGz, New Jersey rapper Nick Javas, and Houston rapper Khaleel. Tha Blaqprint by Blaq Poet, which features 13 Premier productions, was released by Year Round Records through Fat Beats Records in June 2009.

The award was shared with Philip W. Anderson and J. H. Van Vleck. The three had conducted loosely related research. Mott and Anderson clarified the reasons why magnetic or amorphous materials can sometimes be metallic and sometimes insulating.BBC video of Mott interviewed by Lewis Wolpert in 1985 (accessed 8 October 2010)* including the Nobel Lecture, December 8, 1977 Electrons in Glass Sir Nevill Francis MottMott's memories University of Bristol (accessed Jan 2006)National Cataloguing Unit for the Archives of Contemporary Scientists Bath University  Education and early life  Mott was born in Leeds to Lilian Mary Reynolds and Charles Francis Mott and grew up first in the village of Giggleswick, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, where his father was Senior Science Master at Giggleswick School. His mother also taught Maths at the School. The family moved (due to his father's jobs) first to Staffordshire, then to Chester and finally Liverpool, where his father had been appointed Director of Education. Mott was at first educated at home by his mother, who was a Cambridge Mathematics Tripos graduate. His parents had met in the Cavendish Laboratory, when both were engaged in physics research. At age ten, he began formal education at Clifton College in Bristol,\\"Clifton College Register\\" Muirhead, J.A.O. p368: Bristol; J.W Arrowsmith for Old Cliftonian Society; April, 1948 then at St John's College, Cambridge, where he read the Mathematics Tripos.  Career and research  Mott was appointed a Lecturer in the Physics Department at the University of Manchester in 1929. He returned to Cambridge in 1930 as a Fellow and lecturer of Gonville and Caius College, and in 1933 moved to the University of Bristol as Melville Wills Professor in Theoretical Physics. In 1948 he became Henry Overton Wills Professor of Physics and Director of the Henry Herbert Wills Physical Laboratory at Bristol. In 1954 he was appointed Cavendish Professor of Physics at Cambridge, a post he held until 1971. He was instrumental in the painful cancellation of the planned particle accelerator because of its very high cost. He also served as Master of Gonville and Caius College, 1959‚Äì1966. His early works were on the theoretical analysis of collisions in gases, notably the collision with spin flip of an electron against a hydrogen atom, which would stimulate subsequent works by Andr√© Blandin and Jun Kondo about similar effects between conduction electrons, as well as magnetic properties in metals. This sort of activity led Mott to writing two books. The first one, which was edited together with Ian Sneddon, gives a simple and clear description of quantum mechanics, with an emphasis on the Schr√∂dinger equation in real space. The second describes atomic and electronic collisions in gases, using the rotational symmetry of electronic states in the Hartree‚ÄìFock method. But already in the middle of the 1930s, Mott's interests had broadened to include solid states, leading to two more books that would have a great impact on the development of the field in the years prior and after World War II. In 1936, Theory of the Properties of Metals and Alloys (written together with H. Jones) describes a simplified framework which led to rapid progresses. The concept of nearly free valence electrons in metallic alloys explained the special stability of the Hume- Rothery phases if the Fermi sphere of the sp Valence electron, treated as free, would be scattered by the Brillouin zone boundaries of the atomic structure. The description of the impurities in metals by the Thomas Fermi approximation would explain why such impurities would not interact at long range. Finally the delocalisation of the valence d electrons in transitional metals and alloys would explain the possibility for the magnetic moments of atoms to be expressed as fractions of Bohr magnetons, leading to ferro or antiferromagnetic coupling at short range. This last contribution, produced at the first international conference on magnetism, held in Strasbourg in May 1939, reinforced similar points of view defended at the time in France by the future Nobel laureate Louis N√©el. In 1949, Mott suggested to Jacques Friedel to use the approach developed together with Marvey for a more accurate description of the electric-field screening of the impurity in a metal, leading to the characteristic long range charge oscillations. Friedel also used the concept developed in that book of virtual bound level to describe a situation when the atomic potential considered is not quite strong enough to create a (real) bound level of symmetry e ‚â† o. The consequences of these remarks on the more exact approaches of cohesion in rp as well as d metals were mostly developed by his students in Orsay. The second book, with Ronald Wilfred Gurney, On the Physical Chemistry of Solids was more diverse. It treated notably of the oxidation of metals at low temperatures, where it described the growth of the oxide layer as due to the electric field developed between the metal and absorbed oxygen ions, which could force the way of metallic or oxygen ions through a disordered oxide layer. The book also analysed the photographic reactions in ionic silver compound in terms of precipitation of silver ions into metallic clusters. This second field had a direct and long lasting consequence on the research activity of John (Jack) Mitchell. Mott's accomplishments include explaining theoretically the effect of light on a photographic emulsion (see latent image). His work on oxidation, besides fostering new research in the field (notably by J. B√©nard and Nicol√°s Cabrera), was the root of the concept of the band gap produced in semiconductors by gradients in the distribution of donor and acceptor impurities. When Mott returned to Bristol after the war, (during that period, he worked on the role of plastic deformation on the progression of fracture cracks), his having met and hired of Frederick Charles Frank led both of them to develop, with the help of others such as Frank Nabarro and Alan Cottrell, to attack with the field of dislocations, in which Bristol shone with a new vigor, especially at the end of the 1940s. If Mott only produced early and somewhat minor contributions to that field, notably on alloy hardening with Nabarro and on the topology of a dislocation network lowering the apparent elastic constants of a crystal, there is no doubt that Mott's enthusiasm played its role in the three major steps forward in the field by F. C. Frank on crystal growth and plasticity and later, in Cambridge, by P. Hirsch on the thin film electron microscopy. At the same time, however, Mott started playing around electronic correlations and their possible role in Verwey's compounds such as nickel oxides which could switch from metals to insulators under various physical conditions (transition of substances from metallic to nonmetallic states (Mott transition). The term Mott insulator is also named for him, as well as the Mott polynomials, which he introduced. = Publications = N. F. Mott revived the old Philosophical Magazine and transformed it into a lively publication essentially centred on the then-new field of solid state physics, attracting writers, readers and general interest on a wide scale. After receiving a paper on point defects in crystals by Frederick Seitz that was obviously too long for Phil. Mag, Mott decided to create a new publication, Advances in Physics for such review papers. Both publications are still active in 2017. * N. F.

Following decades of development, during 2004, the RAH-66 program was canceled prior to mass production commencing, by which point nearly US$7 billion had been already spent on the program. During the early 1980s, the U.S. Army started to formulate requirements for the replacement of its helicopters then in service, which resulted in the launch of the Light Helicopter Experimental (LHX) program. Nearly a decade later, following the refinement of requirements, evaluation of submissions, and the rebranding of the programme as the Light Helicopter (LX) program, during April 1991, the Army announced the selection of the Boeing‚ÄìSikorsky team's design as the contest winner, shortly after which a contract for construction of prototypes was awarded. The Comanche was to incorporate several advanced elements, such as stealth technologies, and a number of previously untried design features. Operationally, it was to employ advanced sensors in its reconnaissance role, where it was intended to designate targets for the AH-64 Apache. It was also armed with one rotary cannon and could carry missiles and rockets in internal bays and optionally on stub wings for light attack duties. A pair of RAH-66 prototypes were constructed and underwent flight testing between 1996 and 2004. On 1 June 2000, the program entered its $3.1 billion engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) phase. However, during 2002, the Comanche program underwent heavy restructuring; the number of Comanches that were to be purchased was cut to 650. At the time, the projected total cost for the full production of the Comanche in such numbers stood at $26.9 billion. As early as the late 1990s, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) had reported that it had \\"serious doubts\\" about the program, observing that the Comanche would \\"consume almost two thirds of the whole Aviation budget by Fiscal Year 2008\\". Multiple government agencies had acted to cut the number of Comanches on order, but, as a consequence of the heavy reductions to the numbers to be procured, the unit costs soared. On 23 February 2004, the U.S. Army announced the termination of the Comanche program, stating they had determined that the RAH-66 would require numerous upgrades to be viable on the battlefield and that the service would instead direct the bulk of its rotary systems funds to renovating its existing attack, utility, and reconnaissance helicopters. The Army also announced new plans to accelerate the development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which could also perform the scouting role intended for the Comanche, but with less risk. Since program cancellation, both of the prototypes have been placed on public display. Development =Origins and LHX= During 1982, the U.S. Army initiated the Light Helicopter Experimental (LHX) program with the aim of producing a replacement for several existing rotorcraft, including the UH-1, AH-1, OH-6, and OH-58 helicopters. It was a further six years until, in 1988, a formal request for proposal (RFP) was issued to various manufacturers, in time which the requirement had evolved into a battlefield reconnaissance helicopter.Eden 2004, p. 138.Frawley 2007, p. 50. In October 1988, the Army announced two teams, these being Boeing‚ÄìSikorsky and Bell‚ÄìMcDonnell Douglas, received contracts to further develop their concepts.Harding 1997. pp. 75‚Äì76. During the 1990s, the program's name was changed from LHX to simply Light Helicopter (LH). In April 1991, the Army awarded the Boeing‚ÄìSikorsky team a $2.8 billion contract to complete six prototypes. Later that month the helicopter received its official designation of RAH-66 Comanche. During November 1993, assembly of the first prototype commenced at Sikorsky's facility in Stratford, Connecticut and at Boeing's manufacturing plant in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Later all of the rotorcraft's sub-assemblies were transferred to the former location where final assembly occurred. In December 1994, the Department of Defense reduced the number of planned prototypes to two as the services shifted budgets to pay for increased troop salaries. On 25 May 1995, the first Comanche prototype was formally rolled out at Sikorsky's production facility, after which it was transferred to West Palm Beach, Florida to commence flight testing activities.Eden 2004, p. 139. On 4 January 1996, the prototype Comanche, flown by test pilots Bob Gradle and Rus Stiles, performed its 39-minute maiden flight. The first flight had been originally planned to take place during August 1995, but had been delayed by a number of structural and software problems that had been encountered. On 30 March 1999, the second prototype conducted its first flight, before joining the flight test program shortly thereafter. =Prototype testing= An RAH-66 Comanche flying in formation with an AH-64 Apache. Part of the Comanche's planned role was to designate targets for the Apache. The flight test program was conducted using the pair of prototypes produced, which had been assigned the serial numbers 94-0327 and 95-0001. Following a demonstration of its ability to meet certain key criteria, on 1 June 2000, the RAH-66 entered the $3.1 billion engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) phase of the program.Flight International 2000, p. 6. Through the early 2000s, the U.S. Army maintained its plans for the intended purchase of over 1,200 Comanches, which were to fill both the scout helicopter and light attack roles; as late as 2003, it was being anticipated that deliveries of operational RAH-66s would commence as scheduled during 2006.Lopez 2000, p. 29. However, the program was not problem-free. During late 2000, it was revealed that an effort to reduce the Comanche's empty weight by approximately or 2.1 per cent in order to conform with its established target weight had been initiated. The first Comanche prototype, serial 94-0327, completed 318 flights over 387 hours before reaching the end of its testing career during January 2002\\\\. The second prototype, serial 95-0001, had accumulated 103.5 flight hours and 93 sorties by May 2001. During late 2001 and early 2002, testing with the second RAH-66 was halted while the aircraft underwent extensive modifications, received both mission equipment and more powerful T800-LHT-801 engines. On 23 May 2002, the second prototype re-commenced flight testing with the additional equipment fitted. Accordingly, the expanded test programme involved new aspects such as the testing of the armaments and night vision systems; these test flights continued into 2003. During testing, the Comanche was recorded as having attained a cruise speed of , as well as having achieved a \\"dash speed\\" of ; perhaps one of its more atypical capabilities was the demonstrated ability to perform a 180¬∞ turn in under five seconds. During 2002, the Comanche program underwent heavy restructuring; consequently, the planned number of Comanches to be purchased was decreased to 650 rotorcraft. At the time, the projected total cost for the full production of the Comanche in such numbers stood at $26.9 billion. Originally, the EMD phase was to last for six years with five Comanches to be constructed for the testing regime. During 2003, production on the third RAH-66, which was to be the first EMD-conformant helicopter, was started. Subsequently, eight RAH-66s were to be constructed for operational testing purposes.Jackson 2007. The initial production RAH-66s were to be completed in a Block I configuration that included the majority of the rotorcraft's planned weapons and sensors. From the 16th Comanche onwards, deliveries would have been made to the Block II standard with all of the planned capabilities. =Cancellation= On 23 February 2004, the U.S. Army announced that they had decided to terminate all work on the Comanche program. At the time, it was stated that the Army had determined that a number of upgrades would be necessary in order for the RAH-66 to be capable of surviving on the battlefield in the face of current anti-aircraft threats; however, the Army had instead decided to re-direct the bulk of its funding for rotary development toward the renovation of its existing helicopter fleet of attack, utility, and reconnaissance aircraft. Specifically, the Army also had plans to reuse the funds allocated to the Comanche program to speed up development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which could also perform the scouting role intended for the vehicle. At the time of its termination, the Comanche program had reportedly spent US$6.9 billion. The contract termination fees involved were estimated to total US$450‚Äì680 million for the main program partners Sikorsky and Boeing. Subsequently, the Army decided to pursue development of another battlefield scout helicopter under the Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter program; this resulted in another rotorcraft, designated as the Bell ARH-70, being selected and developed with the intention to replace the OH-58D in place of the Comanche. However, on 16 October 2008, the Department of Defense notified Congress and Bell that it was canceling the program, reportedly due to cost overruns on its development. A multitude of reasons contributed to the ultimate cancellation of the RAH-66 program. According to aviation author James Williams, efforts to speed up the program via the elimination of risk- mitigation measures and the stream of continuous adjustments to account for annual budget cuts to the rotorcraft resulted in the formation of a negative cycle that functioned to greatly extend the rotorcraft's development schedule. Over the course of the Comanche's development, multiple government agencies had acted to cut the number of helicopters that were intended to be ordered; one particularly common basis for such curtailments was that the Cold War had ended and thus such quantities were unnecessary (a phenomenon known as the \\"Peace Dividend\\"). However, significant reductions in volume directly resulted in the rapid climbs in the projections of the Comanche's unit cost; in turn, this stimulated and gave validity to critics of the program, such as the Army Acquisition Executive James Ambrose, who had prominently declared that the Army would not receive any aircraft \\"costing a dollar over $7.5 million\\".Williams 2005, p. 342. As early as 1995, it is claimed by Williams that the Comanche had been facing complete cancellation as a choice between which defense development programs were to be scrapped.Williams 2005, p. 343. During mid-1999, the Comanche was subject to substantial governmental scrutiny; the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that it had \\"serious doubts\\" about the program and noted that the Comanche would \\"consume almost two thirds of the whole Aviation budget by Fiscal Year 2008\\". In addition, wartime experiences, such as from the Kosovo War, had led to some senior figures within the Army to place a greater emphasis on the use of unmanned platforms for conducting many of the same roles for which the Comanche was being developed to perform.Williams 2005, p. 346. By 2000, Williams postulates that the primary reason for retaining the program was out of concern for the state of the helicopter industry‚ÄîSikorsky's production and employment figures were at their lowest for decades and the contract was considered critical.Williams 2005, pp. 346‚Äì347. Author Fred Brooks criticized the program's requirement for the Comanche to be capable of ferrying itself across the Atlantic as an example of excessive requirements being present in a project's design phase and of their costly repercussions.Brooks 2010, pp. 39‚Äì41. Williams observes that the Comanche's weight requirements were unachievable, and claimed that this was due to poor management, in which no party was allegedly aware of or in control of the rotorcraft's final weight; there were concerns that, when outfitted with actual equipment required for operations, the Comanche's engines would be incapable of lifting the total weight of the helicopter. Additionally, it has been claimed that it proved difficult to convince the Army that the program suffered from serious troubles while key individuals failed to realize the existence of insurmountable technical problems. Prized elements of the program, such as certain software capabilities and its integration, failed to foster confidence with Army overseers; several capabilities were viewed as having been unproven and risky, while the anticipated consumption of up to 40 per cent of the aviation budget by the Comanche alone for a number of years was considered to be extreme. According to Williams, it was concluded that the Army's aviation budget would be better spent on the delivery of less risky and more critical needs.Williams 2005, p. 349. In a report published during 2008, the GAO recorded that an Army spokesperson had stated that \\"the program's costs could no longer be justified\\".Government Accountability Office 2008, p. 10. Author Cindy Williams stated of the Comanche: \\"The rationale for cutting Comanche... is twofold. First, the doctrinal niche that the Comanche occupies is unnecessary in the near term and probably not viable in the longer term. Secondly, as with all rotary-wing aircraft, the Comanche is a voracious consumer of strategic airlift.\\"Williams 2001, p. 169. The manufacturing team, Sikorsky and Boeing, have attributed factors that were outside of their control, such as budget cuts, \\"requirement creep\\", and a protracted development period, to have caused problems with the program, rather than dysfunctionality on their part. Under the Comanche program, each company was responsible for the construction of different elements of the rotorcraft. Since the termination, both companies have decided to team up again to produce a jointly-developed prototype, designated as the SB-1 Defiant, for the Army's Future Vertical Lift (FVL) programme.Sikorsky-Boeing confident SB-1 Defiant won‚Äôt be the next Comanche - Flightglobal.com, 22 October 2013. Archived on 22 July 2014. Design RAH-66 prototype in 1997. The Comanche was intended to be an advanced armed reconnaissance and attack helicopter. The Comanche was specifically tailored to the role of armed scout to replace the U.S. Army's OH-58D Kiowa Warrior, which is an upgraded version of a Vietnam War-era observation helicopter. It was both smaller and lighter than the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter that it had been intended to accompany. The RAH-66 was powered by a pair of LHTEC T800 turboshaft engines, each capable of generating up to 1,563 hp (1,165 kW) of power. The RAH-66's fuselage was long and composed of composite materials; it was designed to be capable of fitting more readily onto transport ships, enabling the Comanche to be more rapidly deployed to flash points and other rapidly-developing situations.Bonds & Miller 2002, pp.81‚Äì82. However, in the event of strategic transport assets not being available, the helicopter's ferry range of would have allowed it to fly itself to battlefields overseas on its own. As intended, it would have functioned as a stealth helicopter, incorporating a number of different techniques and technologies in order to reduce its radar cross-section (RCS) along with other areas of visibility and detectability.Bonds & Miller 2002, p. 81. The exterior surfaces of the RAH-66 were faceted and covered with both radar-absorbent material (RAM) coatings and infrared-suppressant paint; as a result of these combined measures, the Comanche's RCS was stated to be 360 times smaller than that of the AH-64 Apache. The acoustic signature of the helicopter was also reported to be noticeably lower than comparative helicopters; this reduction had been partially achieved through the adoption of an all-composite five-blade main rotor and pioneering canted tail rotor assembly. As intended, the Comanche was to be equipped with sophisticated avionics, including navigation and detection systems, which would have enabled operations at night and in inclement weather. Its primary mission was scouting using its advanced sensors, in particular locating and designating targets for attack helicopters, such as the AH-64 Apache, to strike.Crawford 2003, p. 88. The Comanche was furnished with a digital fly-by-wire flight control system. Each of the two crew members were to be provided with a pair of LCD multi-functional displays in addition to the Helmet-Integrated Display and Sight System (HIDSS). For the light attack role, the RAH-66 was to be furnished with various armaments. It was equipped with a single chin-mounted 20 mm three-barrel XM301 rotary cannon, which could be pointed rearwards and retracted under a fairing when not in use to decrease the helicopter's radar cross-section. In addition, the RAH-66 was capable of internally carrying a maximum of six AGM-114 Hellfire air-to-ground missiles or up to twelve AIM-92 Stinger air-to-air missiles, which would be evenly divided between a pair of retractable weapons pylons. Beyond storing munitions internally, the Comanche could also mount external stub wings to carry up to eight Hellfire missiles or sixteen Stinger missiles. However, operations performing with armaments mounted externally would reduce of the effectiveness of the Comanche's stealth technologies. Aircraft on display Both prototype airframes 94-0327, 95-0001, are located at the United States Army Aviation Museum at Fort Rucker, Alabama.

Due to his success in extending American commerce he became known as \\"father of the colonies\\".http://www.gov.ns.ca/nsarm/virtual/deportation/exhibit.asp?ID=7&Language;=French President of the Board of Trade from 1748 to 1761, he aided the foundation of Nova Scotia, 1749, the capital Halifax being named after him. Early life The son of the 1st Earl of Halifax, he was styled Viscount Sunbury until succeeding his father as Earl of Halifax in 1739 (thus also styled in common usage Lord Halifax). Educated at Eton College and at Trinity College, Cambridge, he was married in 1741 to Anne Richards (died 1753), who had inherited a great fortune from Sir Thomas Dunk, whose name Halifax took. Career The Earl of Halifax and his secretaries Coat of arms of George Montagu-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax, KG, PC After having been an official in the household of Frederick, Prince of Wales, Halifax was made Master of the Buckhounds, and in 1748 he became President of the Board of Trade. While filling this position he helped to found Halifax, the capital of Nova Scotia, which was named after him, and he helped foster trade, especially with North America. About this time he attempted, unsuccessfully, to become a Secretary of State, but was only allowed to enter the Cabinet in 1757. In March 1761, Halifax was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and during part of the time which he held this office he was also First Lord of the Admiralty. He became Secretary of State for the Northern Department under Lord Bute in October 1762, switching to the Southern Department in 1763 and was one of the three ministers to whom King George III entrusted the direction of affairs during the premiership of George Grenville. In 1762, in search of evidence of sedition, he authorised a raid on the home of John Entick, declared unlawful in the case of Entick v. Carrington. In 1763, he signed the general warrant for the \\"authors, printers and publishers\\" of The North Briton number 45, under which John Wilkes and 48 others were arrested, and for which, six years later, the courts of law made Halifax pay damages. He was also mainly responsible for the exclusion of the name of the King's mother, Augusta, Princess of Wales, from the Regency Bill of 1765. Together with his colleagues, Halifax left office in July 1765, returning to the Cabinet as Lord Privy Seal under his nephew, Lord North, in January 1770. He had just been restored to his former position of Secretary of State when he died. Cricket Like his friends John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford and John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, Halifax was keen on cricket. The earliest surviving record of his involvement in the sport comes from 1741 when he led Northamptonshire in a match against Buckinghamshire at Cow Meadow in Northampton. In the same season, Sandwich and Halifax formed the Northamptonshire & Huntingdonshire team which twice defeated Bedfordshire, first at Woburn Park and then at Cow Meadow.Maun, pp. 106‚Äì107.Waghorn, Cricket Scores, p. 27. Legacy =Social, moral and cultural impact= Halifax, who was Lord-Lieutenant of Northamptonshire and a Lieutenant General, was very extravagant. He was a political patron of playwright and civil servant Richard Cumberland. He left no legitimate male children, and his titles became extinct on his death. Horace Walpole, 4th Earl of Orford spoke slightingly of him and his mistress, Anna Maria Faulkner including alleging that Halifax had \\"sold every employment in his gift\\".\\"Lord Lucan and others at Hampton Court House\\" Watford Observer English History article. His mistress had kept a low profile while he was in Ireland, but she was understood to have sold positions. =Memorials= Halifax was buried in the parish church of Horton, Northamptonshire; an effigy bust and plaque features in the north transept of Westminster Abbey. An obelisk is erected at Chicksands Wood in the parish of Haynes, Bedfordshire inscribed to his memory. =Related locations= The municipality of Halifax and Halifax County, Nova Scotia are named in his honour, as are the Halifax River in Central Florida; the town of Halifax and Halifax County, North Carolina; Halifax, Virginia in the United States; and Dunk Island in Queensland and Montague Island in New South Wales.

J. H. Van Vleck's theoretical work led to the establishment of the Los Alamos Nuclear Weapons Laboratory. He also served on the Los Alamos Review committee in 1943. The committee, established by General Leslie Groves, also consisted of W. K. Lewis of MIT, Chairman; E. L. Rose, of Jones & Lamson; E. B. Wilson of Harvard; and Richard C. Tolman, Vice Chairman of NDRC. The committee's important contribution (originating with Rose) was a reduction in the size of the firing gun for the Little Boy atomic bomb, a concept that eliminated additional design weight and sped up production of the bomb for its eventual release over Hiroshima. However, it was not employed for the Fat Man bomb at Nagasaki, which relied on implosion of a plutonium shell to reach critical mass.Leslie R. Groves, Lieutenant General, U.S. Army, Retired; Now It Can Be Told, Harper, 1962, pp. 162‚Äì63. The philosopher and historian of science Thomas Kuhn completed a Ph.D. in physics under van Vleck's supervision at Harvard. In 1961/62 he was George Eastman Visiting Professor at University of OxfordNobel Laureates , University of Oxford. and held a professorship at Balliol College.Inspiring minds: the Eastman Professors, Floreat Domus, Balliol College News, Issue 12, June 2006. In 1950 he became foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1966 and the Lorentz Medal in 1974. For his contributions to the understanding of the behavior of electrons in magnetic solids, Van Vleck was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics 1977, along with Philip W. Anderson and Sir Nevill Mott. Van Vleck transformations, Van Vleck paramagnetism and Van Vleck formula are named after him. Van Vleck died in Cambridge, Massachusetts, aged 81. Awards and honors He was awarded the Irving Langmuir Award in 1965, the National Medal of Science in 1966 and elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1967. He was awarded the Elliott Cresson Medal in 1971, the Lorentz Medal in 1974 and the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1977. Personal life J. H. Van Vleck and his wife Abigail were also important art collectors, particularly in the medium of Japanese woodblock prints (principally Ukiyo-e), known as Van Vleck Collection.

A brother of the 1st Marquess of Hertford, and cousin of Horace Walpole, he began his military career in the War of the Austrian Succession. He held various political offices including Chief Secretary for Ireland, Secretary of State for the Southern Department, Leader of the House of Commons and Secretary of State for the Northern Department. He eventually rose to the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Forces. Family and education Conway was the second son of Francis Seymour-Conway, 1st Baron Conway (whose elder brother Popham Seymour-Conway had inherited the Conway estates) by his third wife, Charlotte Seymour-Conway (n√©e Shorter). He entered Eton College in 1732 and from that time enjoyed a close friendship with his cousin Horace Walpole. Early army career Conway joined the Molesworth's Regiment of Dragoons on 27 June 1737 as a lieutenant.Heathcote p.92 He was transferred to the 1st Foot Guards and was promoted to captain on 14 February 1741 and to captain- lieutenant (the equivalent of lieutenant colonel) on 10 May 1742. During the War of Austrian Succession he served on the staff of Field Marshal George Wade at Dettingen in June 1743 and on the staff of the Duke of Cumberland at the Fontenoy in May 1745.Heathcote p.93 Appointed colonel of the 48th Foot on 6 April 1746, he took part in Culloden later that month during the Jacobite Rebellion. His next battle, in July 1747, was at Lauffeld, in which he narrowly escaped death, being captured by the French but released on parole a few days later. In July 1749, he transferred from the 48th Foot to the 34th Foot, and served with his regiment in the garrison of Menorca in 1751. Early political career Conway was elected unopposed to the Irish Parliament in 1741 for Antrim County, and to the British Parliament for Higham Ferrers in December 1741 on the recommendation of Sir Robert Walpole. He was elected in 1747 for Penryn and for St Mawes in 1754, both in the Boscawen interest. He was promoted to major-general on 12 March 1755. In April 1755, he was unexpectedly appointed Chief Secretary for Ireland by William Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington, the new Lord Lieutenant. He then finally took his seat for County Antrim in the Irish House of Commons in October 1755. It was hoped that he would resolve the conflict in Irish politics between the Speaker, Henry Boyle on the one side and George Stone, Archbishop of Armagh and John Ponsonby: ultimately, he reached a compromise, acceptable to the British Ministry, in which Boyle was bought off with an earldom and John Ponsonby became Speaker. He became a Groom of the Bedchamber in April 1757 to both George II and George III (until 1764). Seven Years War Waldeck Castle, captured by Conway in 1762 during the Seven Years' War Conway was the British military second in command on the Rochefort expedition in 1757, and repeatedly advocated an attack on Fort Fouras, but his colleagues would only agree a night attack (which failed). Ultimately the expedition returned to Portsmouth having achieved nothing. Though Mordaunt (the commander in chief) was acquitted by his court-martial, the affair damaged both their reputations. In his displeasure, George II refused to employ Conway on the 1758 campaigns. He was not employed again until the next reign, except that he was sent to sign a cartel for an exchange of prisoners at Sluys in 1759. On 21 April 1759 he became colonel of the 1st The Royal Dragoons and on 25 August 1759 he was promoted to lieutenant general. In 1761, he served in Germany as deputy to John Manners, Marquess of Granby, the British commander in the army led by Ferdinand of Brunswick. At the Battle of Villinghausen in July 1761 he commanded a corps which was at the centre of the line and not attacked. He was also present at the Battle of Wilhelmsthal in June 1762, and captured the castle of Waldeck the following month. After peace preliminaries were signed at Fontainebleau in November, he supervised the embarkation of British troops from Europe, returning to England in March. Later political career Conway was re-elected to the House of Commons in April 1761, this time for Thetford and on 4 July 1761 he became a member of the Privy Council. As a senior member of the Rockingham faction of the Whigs, he opposed the King's legal actions against the reformist John Wilkes in 1763 which resulted in his dismissal in 1764 as a Groom of the Bedchamber and as Colonel of the 1st Royal Dragoons. This led to the publication of accusation and counter-accusation in pamphlets, as it was feared that the government intended to purge the army of its political opponents. He entered office with Lord Rockingham as Secretary of State for the Southern Department in July 1765 before switching to the Northern Department in May 1766, serving until January 1768, when he became a Minister without Portfolio. In these offices, Conway sought to urge a moderate policy towards the American colonies, being the principal supporter of the repeal of the Stamp Act, and opposing the taxation policies of Chancellor of the Exchequer Charles Townshend. Return to the Army Following his resignation in January 1768, Conway returned to the military, and was made a full general on 26 May 1772 and Governor of Jersey on 22 October 1772. He remained an important figure in the Commons, opposing the British attempt to suppress the American Revolt.Heathcote p.94 He was rewarded with a cabinet position and the office of Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in the new Rockingham ministry in March 1782. His political career came to an end in 1784 when he lost his seat in parliament due to his opposition to the new government of William Pitt and he focused thereafter on his military responsibilities retaining his post as Commander-in Chief until his complete retirement in January 1793. He was promoted to field marshal on 18 October 1793 and died, at his home, Park Place at Remenham in Berkshire, on 9 July 1795. Family On 19 December 1747 he married Caroline, the widow of Charles Bruce, 4th Earl of Elgin and 3rd Earl of Ailesbury, and daughter of Lieutenant-General John Campbell, later the 4th Duke of Argyll. They had one daughter, the sculptor Anne Seymour Damer.

Afterwards, Glashow became a NSF fellow at NORDITA and joined the University of California, Berkeley where he was an associate professor from 1962 to 1966.Sheldon Glashow. Jewishvirtuallibrary.org.

Glashow has been a visiting scientist at CERN, and professor at Aix-Marseille University, MIT, Brookhaven Laboratory, Texas A&M;, the University of Houston, and Boston University. Research In 1961, Glashow extended electroweak unification models due to Schwinger by including a short range neutral current, the Z0. The resulting symmetry structure that Glashow proposed, SU(2) √ó U(1), forms the basis of the accepted theory of the electroweak interactions. For this discovery, Glashow along with Steven Weinberg and Abdus Salam, was awarded the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics. In collaboration with James Bjorken, Glashow was the first to predict a fourth quark, the charm quark, in 1964. This was at a time when 4 leptons had been discovered but only 3 quarks proposed. The development of their work in 1970, the GIM mechanism showed that the two quark pairs: (d.s), (u,c), would largely cancel out flavor changing neutral currents, which had been observed experimentally at far lower levels than theoretically predicted on the basis of 3 quarks only. The prediction of the charm quark also removed a technical disaster for any quantum field theory with unequal numbers of quarks and leptons ‚Äî an anomaly ‚Äî where classical field theory symmetries fail to carry over into the quantum theory. In 1973, Glashow and Howard Georgi proposed the first grand unified theory. They discovered how to fit the gauge forces in the standard model into an SU(5) group, and the quarks and leptons into two simple representations. Their theory qualitatively predicted the general pattern of coupling constant running, with plausible assumptions, it gave rough mass ratio values between third generation leptons and quarks, and it was the first indication that the law of Baryon number is inexact, that the proton is unstable. This work was the foundation for all future unifying work. Glashow shared the 1977 J. Robert Oppenheimer Memorial Prize with Feza G√ºrsey. Criticism of superstring theory Glashow is a skeptic of superstring theory due to its lack of experimentally testable predictions. He had campaigned to keep string theorists out of the Harvard physics department, though the campaign failed.Jim Holt (2006-10-02), \\"Unstrung\\", The New Yorker. Retrieved on 2012-07-27.

Geography Halton lies just outside the Metropolitan Green Belt so it has not been protected from postwar housing development. At its southern end it is contiguous with Wendover, but it retains a separate, older village centre anchored by St Michael & All Angels Church and a community hall. There is a separate, modern Catholic Church. The Parish also includes RAF Halton, a Royal Air Force (RAF) training station with a grass airfield used for glider training. Most modern housing in the village was built for RAF personnel, but some is now in private hands. A small shop mainly serves the RAF community. The base had a large military hospital employing hundreds of people, which was closed in 1995. The buildings remained until 2007/8 when they were demolished for the Princess Mary Gate housing scheme on land between Halton and Wendover. In the Chiltern Hills above Halton is Halton House, a country house in the style of a French chateau, which is currently used as the main Officers' Mess for RAF Halton. It was originally built for Alfred de Rothschild in 1880. The RAF demolished its domed winter garden to build an accommodation block. Facilities Halton Community Combined School is a mixed primary school, which takes children from the age of four through to the age of eleven. The school has 91 pupils and was recently (Mar 2011) judged 'excellent' by OFSTED, despite having 70% of its pupils from Forces backgrounds who move frequently. The Halton Tennis Centre has a small number of future athletes combining competitive tennis training with home schooling. The Centre was formerly run by the RAF, who still train there. Transport The nearest railway station is Wendover, on the Chiltern Railways line between Aylesbury and London Marylebone (via Amersham). Journey times to London are under an hour. A single track railway line used to run from Halton, crossing the A413 by way of a level crossing, to a bay platform at the north end of Wendover station. Route 50 is served by Arriva and is a bus from and to the Main Point at RAF Halton. The Wendover arm of the Grand Union Canal flows through Halton on its course from Wendover to join the Grand Union beside Marsworth lock near Tring.

Plaque honoring the first settlers of Qu√©bec City Quebec has played a special role in French history; the modern province occupies much of the land where French settlers founded the colony of Canada (New France) in the 17th and 18th centuries. The population is predominantly French-speaking and Roman Catholic, with a large Anglophone minority, augmented in recent years by immigrants from Asia. The political alienation of the Francophones from the Anglophones has been a persistent theme since the late 19th century. Tensions were especially high during the First World War. Historically, British merchants and financiers controlled the economy and dominated Montreal. The Catholic Church, in close cooperation with the landowners, led a highly traditional social structure in rural and small town Quebec. Much of that changed during the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s. Quebec's separatists, calling for an independent nation, gained strength but were narrowly defeated in two referenda. Quebec imposed increasingly stringent laws favouring the French language; many Anglophones left, as did many of the national and international corporations that had been based in Montreal. From 1966, Montreal's population fell until the 1980s, according to census datahttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_Canadian_cities_by_census#1931. Montreal had been twice the size of Toronto for almost all of the 20th Century. But by 2001, it was finally, no longer the largest city in Canada. Pre-Columbian (prehistory‚Äì1533) Aboriginal settlements were located across the area of present-day Quebec before the arrival of Europeans. In the northernmost areas of the province, Inuit communities can be found. Other aboriginal communities belong to the following First Nations: *Abenakis *Algonquins *Atikamekw *Crees *Innu *Malecite *Mi'kmaq *Mohawks *Naskapi *Wendats The aboriginal cultures of present-day Quebec are diverse, with their own languages, way of life, economies, and religious beliefs. Before contact with Europeans, they did not have a written language, and passed their history and other cultural knowledge along to each generation through oral tradition. Today around three-quarters of Quebec's aboriginal populations lives in small communities scattered throughout the rural areas of the province, with some living on reserves. Jacques Cartier sailed into the St. Lawrence River in 1534 and established an ill-fated colony near present-day Quebec City at the site of Stadacona, a village of the St. Lawrence Iroquoians. Linguists and archaeologists have determined these people were distinct from the Iroquoian nations encountered by later French and Europeans, such as the five nations of the Haudenosaunee. Their language was Laurentian, one of the Iroquoian family. By the late 16th century, they had disappeared from the St. Lawrence Valley. =Paleo-Indian Era (11,000‚Äì8000 BC)= Existing archaeological evidence attests to a human presence on the current territory of Quebec sometime around 10,000 BC. Paleo-American populations preceded the arrival of the Algonquian and Iroquois people in southern Quebec about 10,000 years ago. =Archaic era (8000‚Äì1500 BC)= The Paleoindian period was followed by the Archaic, a time when major changes occurred in the landscape and the settlement of the territory of Quebec. With the end of glaciation, the inhabitable territory increased in size and the environment (such as climate, vegetation, lakes and rivers) became increasingly stable. Migrations became rarer and moving around became a seasonal activity necessary for hunting, fishing or gathering. The nomadic populations of the Archaic period were better established and were very familiar with the resources of their territories. They adapted to their surroundings and experienced a degree of population growth. Their diet and tools diversified. Aboriginal peoples used a greater variety of local material, developed new techniques, such as polishing stone, and devised increasingly specialized tools, such as knives, awls, fish hooks, and nets. =Woodland era (3000 BC‚Äì1500 AD)= Agriculture appeared experimentally toward the 8th century. It was only in the 14th century that it was fully mastered in the Saint Lawrence River valley. The Iroquoians cultivated corn, marrow, sunflowers, and beans. Early French exploration (1508‚Äì1607) In 1508, only 16 years after the first voyage of Christopher Columbus, Thomas Auber, who was likely part of a fishing trip near Newfoundland, brought back a few Amerindians to France. This indicates that in the early 16th century, French navigators ventured in the gulf of the St. Lawrence, along with the Basques and the Spaniards who did the same. Also, Jacques Cartier wrote in his journal that when he made his first contacts with the Amerindians (St. Lawrence Iroquoians), that they came to him in their boats to offer him furs. All these facts and several other details encourage us to believe that this was not the first meeting of Amerindians and Europeans. =Jacques Cartier's voyages= A portrait of Jacques Cartier. On June 24, 1534, French explorer Jacques Cartier planted a cross on the Gasp√© Peninsula and took possession of the territory in the name of King Fran√ßois I of France. On his second voyage on May 26, 1535, Cartier sailed upriver to the St. Lawrence Iroquoian villages of Stadacona, near present-day Quebec City, and Hochelaga, near present-day Montreal. In 1541, Jean-Fran√ßois Roberval became lieutenant of New France and had the responsibility to build a new colony in America. It was Cartier who established the first French settlement on American soil, Charlesbourg Royal. France was disappointed after the three voyages of Cartier and did not want to invest further large sums in an adventure with such uncertain outcome. A period of disinterest in the new world on behalf of the French authorities followed. Only at the very end of the 16th century interest in these northern territories was renewed. Still, even during the time when France did not send official explorers, Breton and Basque fishermen came to the new territories to stock up on codfish and whale oil. Since they were forced to stay for a longer period of time, they started to trade their metal objects for fur provided by the indigenous people. This commerce became profitable and thus the interest in the territory was revived. Fur commerce made a permanent residence in the country worthwhile. Good relations with the aboriginal providers were necessary. For some fishermen however, a seasonal presence was sufficient. Commercial companies were founded that tried to further the interest of the Crown in colonizing the territory. They demanded that France grant a monopoly to one single company. In return, this company would also take over the colonization of the French American territory. Thus, it would not cost the king much money to build the colony. On the other hand, other merchants wanted commerce to stay unregulated. This controversy was a big issue at the turn of the 17th century. By the end of the 17th century, a census showed that around 10,000 French settlers were farming along the lower St. Lawrence Valley. By 1700, fewer than 20,000 people of French origin were settled in New France, extending from Newfoundland to the Mississippi, with the pattern of settlement following the networks of the cod fishery and fur trade, although most Quebec settlers were farmers. New France (1534‚Äì1759) Modern Quebec was part of the territory of New France, the general name for the North American possessions of France until 1763. At its largest extent, before the Treaty of Utrecht, this territory included several colonies, each with its own administration: Canada, Acadia, Hudson Bay, and Louisiana. The borders of these colonies were not precisely defined, and were open on the western side, as the maps below show: File:1592 4 Nova Doetecum mr.jpg1592‚Äì1594: A map of New France made by cartographers Jan Doetecom, Petrus Plancius, and Cornelis Claesz.

Early years (1608‚Äì1663) Colonial buildings in the Lower Town of Old Quebec, Quebec City. Quebec City was founded in 1608 by Samuel de Champlain. Some other towns were founded before, most famously Tadoussac in 1604 which still exists today, but Quebec was the first to be meant as a permanent settlement and not a simple trading post. Over time, it became the capital of Canada and all of New France. Pierre Le Royer, one of the last active coureur des bois, in 1889. The first version of the town was a single large walled building, called the Habitation. A similar Habitation was established in Port Royal in 1605, in Acadia. This arrangement was made for protection against perceived threats from the indigenous people. The difficulty of supplying the city of Quebec from France and the lack of knowledge of the area meant that life was hard. A significant fraction of the population died of hunger and diseases during the first winter. However, agriculture soon expanded and a continuous flow of immigrants, mostly men in search of adventure, increased the population. The French quickly established trading posts throughout their territory, trading for fur with aboriginal hunters. The coureur des bois, who were freelance traders, explored much of the area themselves. They kept trade and communications flowing through a vast network along the rivers of the hinterland. This network was inherited by the English and Scottish traders after the fall of the French Empire in Quebec, and many of the coureur des bois became voyageurs for the British. The Catholic Church was given en seigneurie large and valuable tracts of land estimated at nearly 30% of all the lands granted by the French Crown in New France.Dalton, Roy. The Jesuit Estates Question 1760‚Äì88, p. 60. University of Toronto Press, 1968. In 1633, Cardinal Richelieu granted a charter to the Company of One Hundred Associates, which had been created by the Cardinal himself in 1627. This gave the company control over the booming fur trade and land rights across the territory in exchange for the company supporting and expanding settlement in New France (at the time encompassing Acadia, Quebec, Newfoundland, and Louisiana). Specific clauses in the charter included a requirement to bring 4000 settlers into New France over the next 15 years. The company largely ignored the settlement requirements of their charter and focused on the lucrative fur trade, only 300 settlers arriving before 1640. The early years of the company's rule were disastrous for Quebec. Because of war with England, the first two convoys of ships and settlers bound for the colony were waylaid near Gasp√© by British privateers under the command of three French-Scottish Huguenot brothers, David, Louis and Thomas Kirke. Quebec was effectively cut off. On 19 July 1629, with Quebec completely out of supplies and no hope of relief, Champlain surrendered Quebec to the Kirkes without a fight. Champlain and other colonists were taken to England, where they learned that peace had been agreed (in the 1629 Treaty of Suza) before Quebec's surrender, and the Kirkes were obliged to return their takings. However, they refused, and it was not until the 1632 Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye that Quebec and all other captured French possessions in North America were returned to New France. Champlain was restored as de facto governor but died three years later. On the verge of bankruptcy, the company lost its fur trade monopoly in 1641 and was finally dissolved in 1662. Sovereign Council (1663‚Äì1760) Seal of Louis XIV, used in the colony when the King determined New France to be a province of France The establishment of the Conseil souverain, political restructuring which turned New France into a province of France, ended the period of company rule and marked a new beginning in the colonization effort. Catholic nuns St. Marguerite Bourgeoys (c.1700), one of the many women who contributed to their communities as nuns. Outside the home, Canadian women had few domains which they controlled. An important exception came with Roman Catholic nuns. Stimulated by the influence in France of the popular religiosity of the Counter-Reformation, new orders for women began appearing in the seventeenth century and became a permanent feature of Quebec society.Carr, Thomas Jr. \\"Writing the Convent in New France: The Colonialist Rhetoric of Canadian Nuns\\". Quebec Studies (2009), Issue 47, pp. 3‚Äì23. The Ursuline Sisters arrived in Quebec City in 1639, and in Montreal in 1641. They spread as well to small towns. They had to overcome harsh conditions, uncertain funding, and unsympathetic authorities as they engaged in educational and nursing functions. They attracted endowments and became important landowners in Quebec. Marie de l'Incarnation (1599‚Äì1672) was the mother superior at Quebec, 1639‚Äì72.Agnes Repplier, M√®re Marie of the Ursulines: a study in adventure (New York, 1931) During the 1759 Quebec Campaign of the Seven Years' War, Augustinian nun Marie-Joseph Legardeur de Repentigny, S≈ìur de la Visitation, managed the H√¥pital G√©n√©ral in Quebec City and oversaw the care of hundreds of wounded soldiers from both the French and British forces. She wrote in after-action report on her work, noting, \\"The surrender of Quebec only increased our work. The British generals came to our hospital to assure us of their protection and at the same time made us responsible for their sick and wounded.\\" The British officers stationed at the hospital reported on the cleanliness and high quality of the care provided. Most civilians deserted the city, leaving the H√¥pital G√©n√©ral as a refugee centre for the poor who had nowhere to go. The nuns set up a mobile aid station that reached out to the cities refugees, distributing food and treating the sick and injured.MacLeod, D. Peter. \\"Women of War\\". Beaver (2009) 89 (4). pp. 28‚Äì34. British conquest (1756‚Äì1760) In the middle of the 18th century, British North America had grown to be close to a full-fledged independent country, something they would actually become a few decades later, with more than 1 million inhabitants. Meanwhile, New France was still seen mostly as a cheap source of natural resources for the metropolis, and had only 60,000 inhabitants. Nevertheless, New France was territorially larger than the Thirteen Colonies, but had a population less than 1/10 the size. There was warfare along the borders, with the French supporting Indian raids into the American colonies.Guy Fr√©gault, Canada: the War of the Conquest (1969). The earliest battles of the French and Indian War occurred in 1754 and soon widened into the worldwide Seven Years' War. The territory of New France at that time included parts of present-day Upstate New York, and a series of battles were fought there. The French military enjoyed early successes in these frontier battles, gaining control over several strategic points in 1756 and 1757. The British sent substantial military forces, while the Royal Navy controlled the Atlantic, preventing France from sending much help. In 1758 the British captured Louisbourg, gaining control over the mouth of the St. Lawrence, and also took control of key forts on the frontier in battles at Frontenac and Duquesne. In spite of the spectacular defeat of the supposed main British thrust in the Battle of Carillon (in which a banner was supposedly carried that inspired the modern flag of Quebec), the French military position was poor. A Martello tower at the Plains of Abraham. In the next phase of the war, begun in 1759, the British aimed directly at the heart of New France. General James Wolfe led a fleet of 49 ships holding 8,640 British troops to the fortress of Quebec. They disembarked on √éle d'Orl√©ans and on the south shore of the river; the French forces under Louis-Joseph de Montcalm, Marquis de Saint-Veran, held the walled city and the north shore. Wolfe laid siege to the city for more than two months, exchanging cannon fire over the river, but neither side could break the siege. As neither side could expect resupply during the winter, Wolfe moved to force a battle. On 5 September 1759, after successfully convincing Montcalm he would attack by the Bay of Beauport east of the city, the British troops crossed close to Cap- Rouge, west of the city, and successfully climbed the steep Cape Diamond undetected. Montcalm, for disputed reasons, did not use the protection of the city walls and fought on open terrain, in what would be known as the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. The battle was short and bloody; both leaders died in battle, but the British easily won. (The Death of General Wolfe is a well- known 1770 painting by artist Benjamin West depicting the final moments of Wolfe.) Now in possession of the main city and capital, and further isolating the inner cities of Trois-Rivi√®res and Montreal from France, the rest of the campaign was only a matter of slowly taking control of the land. While the French had a tactical victory in the Battle of Sainte-Foy outside Quebec in 1760, an attempt to lay siege to the city ended in defeat the following month when British ships arrived and forced the French besiegers to retreat. An attempt to resupply the French military were further dashed in the naval Battle of Restigouche, and Pierre de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnial, New France's last Royal governor, surrendered Montreal on 8 September 1760. Britain's success in the war forced France to cede all of Canada to the British at the Treaty of Paris. The Royal Proclamation of October 7, 1763 by King George III of Great Britain set out the terms of government for the newly captured territory, as well as defining the geographic boundaries of the territory. British rule (1760‚Äì1867) =Royal Proclamation (1763‚Äì1774)= British rule under Royal Governor James Murray was benign, with the French Canadians guaranteed their traditional rights and customs. The British Royal Proclamation of 1763 united three Quebec districts into the Province of Quebec. It was the British who were the first to use the name \\"Quebec\\" to refer to a territory beyond Quebec City. The British tolerated the Catholic Church, and protected the traditional social and economic structure of Quebec. The people responded with one of the highest birth rates ever recorded, 65 births per thousand per yearMason Wade, The French Canadians 1760‚Äì1967 (1975) 1:47 Much French law was retained inside a system of British courts, all under the command of the British governor.Hilda Neatby, The administration of justice under the Quebec Act (1937).Robert Arthur Humphreys, \\"Lord Shelburne and the Proclamation of 1763\\". English Historical Review (1934): 241‚Äì264. in JSTOR The goal was to satisfy the Francophile settlers, albeit to the annoyance of British merchants.Cameron Nish, ed., French Canadians, 1759‚Äì1766: Conquered? half-conquered? liberated? (1966) = Quebec Act (1774) = The Quebec Act of 1774 was an Act of the Parliament of Great Britain setting procedures of governance in the Province of Quebec. Among other components, this act restored the use of the French civil law for private matters while maintaining the use of the English common law for public administration (including criminal prosecution), replaced the oath of allegiance so that it no longer made reference to the Protestant faith, and guaranteed free practice of the Catholic faith. The purpose of this Act was to secure the allegiance of the French Canadians with unrest growing in the American colonies to the south. See drop-down essay on \\"Early European Settlement and the Formation of the Modern State\\" =American Revolutionary War= When the American Revolutionary War broke out in early 1775, Quebec became a target for American forces, that sought to liberate the French population there from British rule. In September 1775 the Continental Army began a two-pronged invasion, with one army capturing Montreal while another traveled through the wilderness of what is now Maine toward Quebec City. The two armies joined forces, but were defeated in the Battle of Quebec, in which the American General Richard Montgomery was slain. The Americans were driven back into New York by the arrival of a large army of British troops and German auxiliaries (\\"Hessians\\") in June 1776. Before and during the American occupation of the province, there was a significant propaganda war in which both the Americans and the British sought to gain the population's support. The Americans succeeded in raising two regiments in Quebec, led by James Livingston and Moses Hazen, one of which served throughout the war. Hazen's 2nd Canadian Regiment served in the Philadelphia campaign and also at the Siege of Yorktown, and included Edward Antill, a New Yorker living in Quebec City (who actually led the regiment at Yorktown as Hazen had been promoted to brigadier general), Cl√©ment Gosselin, Germain Dionne, and many others. Louis-Philippe de Vaudreuil, a Quebecker, was with the French Navy in the Battle of the Chesapeake that prevented the British Navy from reaching Yorktown, Virginia. After General John Burgoyne's failed 1777 campaign for control of the Hudson River, Quebec was used as a base for raiding operations into the northern parts of the United States until the end of the war. When the war ended, large numbers of Loyalists fled the United States. Many were resettled into parts of the province that bordered on Lake Ontario. These settlers eventually sought to separate themselves administratively from the French-speaking Quebec population, which occurred in 1791. =Historiography= Nationalist French Canadian historians have mostly emphasized the success of the little colony, and blamed its shortcomings after 1760 on British conquerors. A contrary view was presented by Fernand Ouellet (b. 1926), who tried to undermine the foundations of Quebec nationalism. He drew attention to the negative role played by women in Quebec society. He has accused fellow historians of trying to \\"normalize\\" Quebec's past, so as to provide a stronger justification of sovereigntyRonald Rudin, Making History in Twentieth Century Quebec (1997) In response, French-speaking historians have been hostile to his suggestion that French-Canadians are the agents of their own difficulties. These historians, instead of dwelling on economic shortcomings, have stressed the deep roots of modernity, a position that Ouellet strongly rejected. In a nutshell, Ouellet insisted that Quebec's history offers \\"more support for the thesis of backwardness and for that of modernization\\".1991 statement quoted in Ronald Rudin, \\"Ouellet, Fernand\\". in For the French Canadians, the chief debate among historians involves the conquest and the incorporation into the British Empire in 1763. One school says it was a disaster that stifled progress for a century and more the normal development of a middle class society, leaving Quebec locked into a traditionalism controlled by priests and landlords.Dale Miquelon, ed., Society and conquest: the debate on the bourgeoisie and social change in French Canada, 1700‚Äì1850 (1977). The other more optimistic school says it was generally advantageous in political and economic terms. For example, it enabled Quebec to avoid the French Revolution that tore France apart in the 1790s. Another example is that it integrated the economy into the larger and faster growing British economy, as opposed to the sluggish French economy. The optimistic school attributes the backwardness of the Quebec economy to deeply ingrained conservatism and aversion to entrepreneurship.Cameron Nish, ed., The French Canadians, 1759‚Äì1766; Conquered? Half-Conquered? Liberated? (1966) has readings on both sides.Serge Gagnon, Quebec and its Historians, 1840 to 1920 (Harvest House, 1982). Constitutional Act (1791‚Äì1840) Louis-Joseph Papineau, leader of the Parti patriote. The Constitutional Act of 1791 divided Quebec into Upper Canada (the part of present-day Ontario south of Lake Nipissing plus the current Ontario shoreline of Georgian Bay and Lake Superior) and Lower Canada (the southern part of present-day Quebec). Newly arrived English-speaking Loyalist refugees had refused to adopt the Quebec seigneurial system of land tenure, or the French civil law system, giving the British reason to separate the English-speaking settlements from the French- speaking territory as administrative jurisdictions. Upper Canada's first capital was Newark (present-day Niagara-on-the-Lake); in 1796, it was moved to York (now Toronto). The new constitution, primarily passed to answer the demands of the Loyalists, created a unique situation in Lower Canada. The Legislative Assembly, the only elected body in the colonial government, was continually at odds with the Legislative and Executive branches appointed by the governor. When, in the early 19th century, the Parti canadien rose as a nationalist, liberal and reformist party, a long political struggle started between the majority of the elected representatives of Lower Canada and the colonial government. The majority of the elected representatives in the assembly were members of the francophone professional class: \\"lawyers, notaries, doctors, innkeepers or small merchants\\", who comprised 77.4% of the assembly from 1792 to 1836. In 1831, more than 50,000 people immigrated to Quebec. The next year brought 52,000 individuals and with them the Asiatic cholera, and within five months 4,200 deaths resulted. The struggle over language finally led to armed rebellions in 1837 and 1838 led by reformers from the Parti canadien, also referred to as the \\"Parti patriote\\". Key goals for the rebels were to have responsible government and, for many, to terminate prejudicial dominance of the English minority over the French majority. Louis- Joseph Papineau was instrumental in acting as a leadership figure for the rebels, yet his ideological views were ambiguous concerning the relative importance of seigneurial landowners, the Roman Catholic Church, and the francophone bourgeoisie. Under his influence, the first rebellion of 1837 was directed at the seigneurs and the clergy as much as the anglophone governor. The 1837 rebellion resulted in a declaration of martial law, and suspension of Canada's Constitution. To centralize authority under the Crown, John Lambton, Lord Durham was named governor of all of British North America. =Martial law and Special Council (1838‚Äì1840)= The second rebellion in 1838 was to have more far-reaching consequences. In 1838, Lord Durham arrived in Canada as High Commissioner. Although skirmishes with British troops were relatively minor during the second rebellion of 1838, the Crown dealt forcefully in punishing the rebels. 850 of them were arrested; 12 were eventually hanged, and 58 were transported to Australian penal colonies. In 1839, Lord Durham was called upon by the Crown to deliver a Report on the Affairs of British North America as a result of the rebellions. The Special Council that governed the colony from 1838 to 1841 enacted many reforms with the aim of improving economic and bureaucratic affairs, such as land ownership and the establishment of new schools. These institutional reforms ultimately became the foundation of \\"responsible government\\" in the colony. Many American colonists who remained loyal to England left the 13 Atlantic colonies before American independence for Canada, with many settling in communities in southern Quebec. In the 19th century, Quebec experienced several waves of immigration, principally from England, Scotland and Ireland. At the turn of the 20th century, immigrants to Quebec came mainly from Ireland, but large numbers of immigrants arrived from Germany and other areas of western Europe. 1840‚Äì1866 =Union Act= Lord Durham recommended that Upper Canada and Lower Canada be united, in order to make the francophone population of Lower Canada a minority within the united territory and weaken its influence. Durham expressed his objectives in plain terms. His recommendation was followed; the new seat of government was located in Montreal, with the former Upper Canada being referred to as \\"Canada West\\" and the former Lower Canada being referred to as \\"Canada East\\". The Act of Union 1840 formed the Province of Canada. Rebellion continued sporadically, and in 1849, the burning of the Parliament Buildings in Montreal led to the relocation of the seat of government to Toronto. Historian Fran√ßois-Xavier Garneau, like other Canada East francophones during the 1840s, had deep concerns about the united entity and the place of the francophones within it.Linteau, Quebec, a History, 1867-1929 p 19 =Emigration= French Canadians had continued to farm as they always had. By the 1850s, soil nutrients were becoming exhausted. Their farming methods were outdated.Brault, Gerard J. The French-Canadian Heritage in New England. Montreal: McGill- Queen's University Press, 1986 p. 52 About this time the textile industry in New England experienced a boom. With living conditions so harsh, and work very hard to find even in the largest city, Montreal, emigration seemed the only option for many. As the first wave moved out in the 1850s, word of mouth soon began to move larger crowds by the late 1870s. Mill owners hired these French immigrants to staff their mills more cheaply than American and Irish-born workers, who were themselves displaced.Brault, Gerard J. The French-Canadian Heritage in New England. Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 1986 pp. 54 When the first wave of emigrants left Quebec, the local government did not pay much attention as the numbers were relatively small. However, when the emigration began to increase and the provincial economy was going through a depression, leaders of the province attempted to halt the emigration. The church warned of hell being destined for those who decided to leave. Nevertheless, more than 200,000 left between 1879‚Äì1901.Roby, Yves. The Franco- Americans of New England: Dreams and Realities. Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2004 pp. 40‚Äì42 Federal Dominion (1867) George-√âtienne Cartier in Montreal, 1863. In the decades immediately before Canadian Confederation in 1867, French-speaking Quebeckers, known at that time as Canadiens, remained a majority within Canada East. Estimates of their proportion of the population between 1851 and 1861 are 75% of the total population, with around 20% of the remaining population largely composed of English-speaking citizens of British or Irish descent.Linteau, Quebec, a History, 1867-1929 p 39 From 1871 to 1931, the relative size of the French- speaking population stayed much the same, rising to a peak of 80.2% of Quebec's population in 1881. The proportion of citizens of British descent declined slightly in contrast, from a peak of 20.4% of the population in 1871, to 15% by 1931. Other minorities made up the remainder of the population of the province.Linteau, Quebec, a History, 1867-1929 p 40 After several years of negotiations, in 1867 the British Parliament passed the British North America Acts, by which the Province of Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia joined to form the Dominion of Canada. Canada East became the Province of Quebec. Canada remained self-governing locally, but the British continued to control its external affairs. George-√âtienne Cartier, a \\"Father of Confederation\\", was the most prominent promoter of Confederation for Quebec. =Growth of Montreal= Urban expansion characterized Montreal around the time of Confederation, as rural French Canadians moved to the city to find work. Immigrants flocked to Montreal, Canada's largest city at the time, and so did many people from other parts of Canada. Major business and financial institutions were established in Montreal, including the headquarters of several national banks and corporations. Prominent businessmen included brewer and politician John Molson Jr., jeweller Henry Birks, and insurer James Bell Forsyth. Montreal's population grew rapidly, from around 9000 in 1800, to 23,000 in 1825, and 58,000 in 1852. By 1911, the population was over 528,000. The City of Montreal annexed many neighbouring communities, expanding its territory fivefold between 1876 and 1918.

The Church operated many of the institutions of the province, including most French-language schools,Linteau, Quebec, a History, 1867‚Äì1929 pp. 212‚Äì213 hospitals, and charitable organizations. The leader of the Catholic Church in Quebec was the Bishop of Montreal, and from 1840 to 1876 this was Ignace Bourget, an opponent of liberalism. Bourget eventually succeeded in gaining more influence than the liberal, reformist Institut Canadien. At his most extreme, Bourget went so far as to deny a Church burial to Joseph Guibord, a member of the Institut, in 1874. A court decision forced Bourget to allow Guibord to be buried in a Catholic cemetery, but Bourget deconsecrated the burial plot of ground, and Guibord was buried under army protection.Linteau, Quebec, a History, 1867‚Äì1929 pp. 203‚Äì204 The conservative approach of the Catholic Church was the major force in Quebec society until the reforms of the Quiet Revolution during the 1960s. Catholic women started dozens of independent religious orders, funded in part by dowries provided by the parents of young nuns. The orders specialized in charitable works, including hospitals, orphanages, homes for unwed mothers, and schools. In the first half of the twentieth century, about 2-3% of Quebec's young women became nuns; there were 6,600 in 1901 and 26,000 in 1941. In Quebec in 1917, 32 different teaching orders operated 586 boarding schools for girls. At that time there was no public education for girls in Quebec beyond elementary school. The first hospital was founded in 1701. In 1936, the nuns of Quebec operated 150 institutions, with 30,000 beds to care for the long-term sick, the homeless, and orphans.Micheline Dumont et al. (The Clio Collective,) Quebec Women: A History (1987) pp. 94‚Äì96, 218‚Äì220, 241 Between 1870 and 1950, thousands of young girls were sent to Quebec City, to the reform school (1870‚Äì1921) and the industrial school (1884‚Äì1950) of the Hospice St-Charles, both operated by the Sisters of the Good Shepherd.Dale Dilbert, \\"Assister les familles de Qu√©bec\\", Revue d'histoire de L'Amerique francaise (2008) 61#3 pp. 469‚Äì499 File:Couvent Soeurs Grises Montreal 1867.jpgConvent belonging to the Grey Nuns (Soeurs Grises), Montreal, 1867. File:Ignace Bourget 1862.jpgIgnace Bourget, Bishop of Montreal, in 1862. =Politics= The 1885 execution in Saskatchewan of M√©tis rebel leader Louis Riel resulted in protests in Quebec, as the French Canadians thought they were being deliberately persecuted for their religion and language. Honor√© Mercier became the outspoken leader of the protest movement. The federal Cabinet members of the Quebec Conservative Party had reluctantly supported Prime minister Macdonald's decision in favour of execution. Support for Conservatives eroded. Seizing the opportunity to build a coalition of his Liberals and dissident Conservatives, Mercier revived the \\"Parti National\\" name for the 1886 Quebec provincial election, and won a majority of seats. However, the coalition consisted of mostly Liberals and only a few Conservatives, so the \\"Liberal\\" name was soon reinstituted. The Conservatives, reduced to a minority in the Legislative Assembly, clung to power for a few more months. Mercier became Premier of Quebec in 1887.Mason Wade, The French Canadians; 1760-1967 (1968) 2:417-33 Seeing provincial autonomy as the political expression of Quebec nationalism, he collaborated with Ontario premier Oliver Mowat to roll back federal centralism. With his strong nationalist stance, Mercier was very much a precursor of later nationalist premiers in future decades who confronted the federal government and tried to win more power for Quebec. He promoted contacts with francophones in other parts of North America outside of Quebec including Western Canada and New England. Those francophones had not yet been assimilated into the English- Canadian or American culture to the extent they would be in the future. Mercier promoted reform, economic development, Catholicism, and the French language. He won popularity but also made enemies. He was returned to the legislature as the Member for the district of Bonaventure and his party won the 1890 election with an increased majority. He was defeated in 1892. =Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier= Sir Wilfrid Laurier in 1869. In 1896, Wilfrid Laurier became the first French Canadian to become Prime Minister of Canada. Educated in both French and English, Laurier remained in office as Prime Minister until October 1911. Laurier had several notable political achievements in Quebec, among them winning Quebec votes for the Liberal Party, against the desires of the powerful Catholic clergy. In 1899, Henri Bourassa was outspoken against the British government's request for Canada to send a militia to fight for Britain in the Second Boer War. Laurier's compromise was to send a volunteer force, but the seeds were sown for future conscription protests during the world wars. Bourassa challenged, unsuccessfully, the proposal to build warships to help protect the empire. He led the opposition to mandatory conscription during World War I, arguing that Canada's interests were not at stake. He opposed Catholic bishops who defended military support of Britain and its allies.Rolando Gomes, \\"Henri Bourassa et l'Imperialisme Britannique (1899-1918),\\" Bulletin d'Histoire Politique (2008) 16#3 pp 161-182. =Boundaries= As more provinces joined Canadian Confederation, there was a pressing need to formalize provincial boundaries. Quebec's provincial boundaries were expanded twice during this period, first in 1898, when the Parliament of Canada passed the Quebec Boundary Extension Act, 1898, and again in 1912, when the Parliament of Canada passed the Quebec Boundaries Extension Act, 1912, expanding the Province's borders to its current status. Population migration also characterized life in late 19th century Quebec. In the late 19th century, overpopulation in the Saint Lawrence Valley led many Quebeckers to immigrate to the Saguenay‚ÄìLac-Saint-Jean region, the Laurentides, and New England, providing a link with that region that continues to this day. In 1927, a Judicial Committee of the Privy Council decided in favour of the British Colony of Newfoundland in a dispute with Canada over the boundary of Labrador.  Depression, War and Postwar: 1929‚Äì1959  =Great Depression= The worldwide Great Depression that began in 1929 hit Quebec hard, as exports, prices, profits and wages plunged and unemployment soared to 30%, and even higher in lumbering and mining districts. Politically there was a move to the right, as Quebec's leaders noted that across the globe the failures attributed to capitalism and democracy had led to the spread of socialism, totalitarianism, and Civil War. The Spanish Civil War in particular alarmed devout Catholics, who demanded that Canada keep out representatives of the anti-Catholic Loyalist government of Spain. There was a wave of clericalism and Quebec nationalism that represented a conservative reaction of a traditional society which feared social change as a threat to its survival.H. Blair Neatby, William Lyon Mackenzie King: 1932‚Äì1939 The Prism of Unity (1976) pp. 232‚Äì233 With so many men unemployed or on lower wages, it was a major challenge for housewives to cope with the shortages of money and resources. Often they updated strategies their mothers used when they were growing up in poor families. Cheap foods were used, such as soups, beans and noodles. They purchased the cheapest cuts of meat‚Äîsometimes even horse meat‚Äîand recycled the Sunday roast into sandwiches and soups. They sewed and patched clothing, traded with their neighbors for outgrown items, and kept the house colder. New furniture and appliances were postponed until better days. These strategies, Baillargeon finds, show that women's domestic labour‚Äîcooking, cleaning, budgeting, shopping, childcare‚Äîwas essential to the economic maintenance of the family and offered room for economies. Most of her informants also worked outside the home, or took boarders, did laundry for trade or cash, and did sewing for neighbors in exchange for something they could offer. Extended families used mutual aid‚Äîextra food, spare rooms, repair-work, cash loans‚Äîto help cousins and in-laws.Denyse Baillargeon, Making Do: Women, Family and Home in Montreal during the Great Depression (Wilfrid Laurier U. Press, 1999) pp. 70, 108, 136‚Äì138, 159. Half the devout Catholics defied Church teachings and used contraception to postpone births‚Äîthe number of births nationwide fell from 250,000 in 1930 to about 228,000 and did not recover until 1940. The populist poet Emile Coderre (1893‚Äì1970), writing as \\"Jean Narrache\\" gave voice to the poor people of Montreal as they struggled for survival during the Great Depression. Writing in the language of the street, Narrache adopted the persona of a man living in poverty who reflects on the ironies attending the meagerness of social assistance, the role of class, the pretensions of the commercial elite, and the counterfeit philanthropy of the rich.√âmile J. Talbot, \\"Populist Poetry in the 1930s: Jean Narrache and the Articulation of Powerlessness\\", American Review of Canadian Studies (2011) 41#4 pp. 479‚Äì494. There was political alienation as more and more voters complained of the indifference and incompetence of both the national leadership of Prime Minister Bennett and the Conservative party,Marc LaTerreur, \\"R. B. Bennett et le Qu√©bec: Un Cas d'Incompr√©hension R√©ciproque\\", Canadian Historical Association Historical Papers (1969) pp. 94‚Äì102. as well as the provincial leadership of Liberal Premier Louis-Alexandre Taschereau.B. L. Vigod, \\"The Quebec Government and Social Legislation during the 1930s: A Study in Political Self-Destruction\\", Journal of Canadian Studies (1979) 14#1 pp 59‚Äì69. Many of the discontented gravitated toward the ultramontane nationalists especially Henri Bourassa, editor of Le Devoir, and the highly traditional Catholic writer Lionel Groulx, editor of L'action canadienne- fran√ßaise. Building on this disenchantment, Maurice Duplessis led the new Union nationale party to victory in 1936 with 58% of the vote and became premier.Susan Mann, The Dream of Nation: A Social and Intellectual History of Quebec (2nd ed 2003) pp. 232‚Äì248 = Second World War = Prosperity returned with the Second World War, as demand soared for the province's manpower, raw materials and manufactures.Mann, The Dream of Nation: A Social and Intellectual History of Quebec (2003) pp 249-65 140,000 young men, both Francophone and Anglophone, rushed to enlist, although English was the dominant language in all the services and essential for promotion.Susan Mann, The Dream of Nation: A Social and Intellectual History of Quebec (2nd ed 2003) p 250 Duplessis expected to ride antiwar sentiment to victory when he called an election in the fall of 1939. He miscalculated as the Liberals scored a landslide, with 70 seats to only 14 for the Union nationale.Susan Mann, The Dream of Nation: A Social and Intellectual History of Quebec (2nd ed 2003) pp 250-51 Canadian leaders managed to avoid the depths of the conscription crisis that had soured relations between Anglophones and Francophones during the First World War. During the Conscription Crisis of 1944 Quebecers protested the conscription. Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King tried, but did not succeed in, avoiding full conscription in Canada, and it became a reality in the final months of World War II. However, the end of the war also meant the end of the crisis. MacKenzie King succeeded in portraying himself as \\"a moderate\\", and at the same time \\"limited the ethnic bitterness\\" that had marked the 1917 conscription crisis. On March 9, 1950, the Fleurdelis√© was approved as the official flag of Quebec =Maurice Duplessis= Premier Maurice Duplessis, 1952. Duplessis returned as premier in the 1944 election, and held power without serious opposition for the next fifteen years, until his death, winning elections in 1948, 1952 and 1956. He became known simply as le Chef (\\"the boss\\"). He championed rural areas, provincial rights, and anti- Communism, and opposed the trade unions, modernizers and intellectuals. He worked well with the powerful Anglo businessmen who controlled most of the economy. A highly controversial figure even today, Duplessis and his Union Nationale party dominated the province. Duplessis' years in power have been ridiculed as the La Grande Noirceur (\\"Great Darkness\\") by his opponents.Conrad Black, Render Unto Caesar: The Life and Legacy of Maurice Duplessis (1998) The Duplessis years were ones of close church-state relations. Quebec society remained culturally insular during this period, in contrast to the modernizing influences sweeping through the rest of North America. Traditional Catholic morality and Church doctrine defined many aspects of daily life, highlighting traditionalism. For example, most schools and hospitals were Church- controlled. Births outside marriage were rare, abortion was illegal, and divorce was not fully legalized in Quebec until 1968.Linteau, Paul-Andr√© (1991). Quebec Since 1930 pp323-40 In recent years, many people in Quebec have spoken out about exploitation by Church and government institutions during the Duplessis years, such as the tragedy of the \\"Duplessis Orphans\\". Agitation for reform came from liberal Quebeckers during the Duplessis years, although such provocative attitudes were often frowned upon and marginalized. In 1948, a collective of artists calling themselves Les Automatistes published , meaning \\"total refusal\\". The pamphlet was an attempt to start a new vision of Quebec. It has been described as \\"an anti-religious and anti-establishment manifesto and one of the most influential social and artistic documents in modern Quebec history\\". It would have a lasting impact, influencing the supporters of Quebec's Quiet Revolution during the 1960s. Other signs of frustration with the status quo appeared with the bitter Asbestos Strike of 1949. It led to a greater appreciation of labour and social-democratic issues in Quebec. In fall of 1950 Rivi√®re-du-Loup was the site of a nuclear accident. A USAF B-50 was returning a nuclear bomb to the USA. The bomb was released due to engine troubles, and then was destroyed in a non-nuclear detonation before it hit the ground. The explosion scattered nearly 100 pounds (45 kg) of uranium (U-238). Quebec's Quiet Revolution (1960‚Äì1970) The Montreal Biosphere, a landmark built for World Expo 67. During the 1960s, the Quiet Revolution ushered in an array of socio-political transformations, from secularism and the welfare state to a specifically Qu√©b√©cois national identity. The baby boom generation embraced the changes that liberalized social attitudes in the province. The 1960s were largely a time of optimism in Quebec. Expo 67 marked Montreal's pinnacle as Canada's largest and most important city and prompted the construction of what is now Parc Jean Drapeau and the Montreal Metro. In 1962, the mayor of Montreal, Jean Drapeau (the man who later was behind Expo 67 and the '76 Olympics projects) instigated the construction of the Metro (subway). The first phase of the subway was completed in 1966. These mega-projects came in the same era as Canada's Confederation centennial celebrations in 1967, when a wave of patriotism swept through most of Canada. During the Quiet Revolution, the government of Quebec invested heavily in the province's industries. A large component of this was nationalizing some predominant industries into state run business, for example Hydro-Qu√©bec, in an attempt to modernize the economy and to encourage the development of francophone businesses. It was during this period that the government established the Caisse de d√©p√¥t et placement du Qu√©bec, the R√©gie des rentes and the Soci√©t√© g√©n√©rale de financement to promote the development of the industries in Quebec. In 1961, the Conseil d‚Äôorientation √©conomique was established to promote economic growth of the regions of Quebec, growth which was once heavily funded by the Government of Canada. The upheavals of the 1960s were also a time of conflict for some in Quebec. The emergence of extremist nationalist violence marked a dark chapter in the province's history, when in 1963, the first bombs of the Front de lib√©ration du Qu√©bec were detonated in Montreal. A major recognition of Quebec's cultural importance came in 1964 when, under authority granted by the Government of Canada, the Province of Quebec signed its first international agreement in Paris. The same year, during an official visit by the Queen, the police were required to maintain order during a demonstration by members of the Quebec separatist movement. Militant activity came to a head in 1970 with the October Crisis, which led to Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau invoking the War Measures Act. In addition, the Quebec Ombudsman Louis Marceau was instructed to hear complaints of detainees and the Quebec government agreed to pay damages to any person unjustly arrested (only in Quebec). On February 3, 1971, John Turner, the Minister of Justice of Canada, reported that 497 persons had been arrested throughout Canada under the War Measures Act, of whom 435 had been released. The other 62 were charged, of whom 32 committed crimes of such seriousness that a Quebec Superior Court judge refused them bail. The crisis ended a few weeks after the death of Pierre Laporte at the hands of his captors. The fallout of the crisis marked the zenith and twilight of the FLQ which lost membership and public support. =Religion and culture= In the midst of the powerful and urban changes, cultural change took root as well. Quebec was greatly affected by the baby boom; between 1960 and 1970, more than 1.2 million Quebeckers reached the age of 14. As more young Qu√©b√©cois rejected Catholic teachings, they made life choices that were a complete change from tradition in the province. Cohabitation rates among young couples rose, as the institution of marriage gradually lost its obligatory status. Births outside of marriage began to rise, from 3.7 percent in 1961 to 10 percent in 1976, then 22 percent by 1984.Linteau, Paul-Andr√© (1991). Quebec Since 1930 p 325 As of 2015, 62.9% of births were outside of marriage. Student protests at local universities erupted, mirroring the youth protests throughout the United States and Western Europe during the 1960s and early 1970s. Reforms included an expansion of post-secondary educational opportunities for both English- and French-speaking Quebeckers. In 1968, the Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al opened. Protests by English-speaking students led to the establishment of Concordia University in Montreal that same year.Linteau, Paul-Andr√© (1991). Quebec Since 1930 p 489 The Quiet Revolution combined declericalization with the Church reforms of Vatican II. There was a dramatic change in the role of nuns. Many left the convent while very few young women entered. The Provincial government took over the nuns' traditional role as provider of many of Quebec's educational and social services. Ex-nuns often continued the same roles in civilian dress, and men for the first time started entering the teaching profession.Micheline D'Allaire, \\"Les Religieuses du Qu√©bec dans le Courant de la La√Øcisation,\\" Cultures du Canada Fran√ßais (1986), Vol. 3, pp 38-45. With the Quiet Revolution, Quebeckers affirmed their identity, especially in the arts, culture and language. It was during the revolution that the government of Quebec formed the Ministry of Culture which focused mainly on defending the French language and culture. The transformation of Quebec was also marked by the adoption of the Law on the assurance-hospitalisation, guaranteeing universal health care through a tax-funded public delivery system. In 1964, Quebec had recognized the equality between men and women and allows all women to have jobs which were once exclusively for men. =Separatism= A monument to separatist Premier Ren√© L√©vesque in Montreal. Quebec nationalism, by now popularly termed Quebec separatism, began to gain momentum in the late 1960s as a vocal minority began to push to bring the movement into the mainstream. In 1967, Ren√© L√©vesque quit the Quebec Liberal Party and founded the Mouvement Souverainet√©-Association. During an official visit to Quebec as a guest of the government of Canada, in front of a huge crowd the President of France, Colonel Charles de Gaulle,who had been temporarily given the rank of general in WWII, undiplomatically declared from the balcony of the Montreal city hall; \\"Vive le Qu√©bec libre!\\" (Long live free Quebec!). The crowd cheered and applauded loudly. A public outcry erupted over such an unprecedented interference in the affairs of another nation, an act to which the Canadian federal government strongly took offence. De Gaulle abruptly cancelled his visit to Ottawa and went home. Violence erupted in 1970 with the October Crisis, when Front de lib√©ration du Qu√©bec members kidnapped British Trade Commissioner James Cross and Quebec Minister of Labour Pierre Laporte. Pierre Laporte was later found murdered. Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau used the War Measures Act, which allowed anyone suspected of being involved with the terrorists to be held temporarily without charge. Not all reformists supported Quebec separatism, for example, the editors of the political journal Cit√© Libre.Linteau, Paul-Andr√© (1991). Quebec Since 1930 p 496 =Politics= The growth of Quebec's government bureaucracy and its perceived interventionism produced friction with the federal government, particularly since the federal government followed a policy of close centralization. English-speaking Canada showed concern at the changes happening in Quebec society and the protests of the Qu√©b√©cois. In 1963, Canada's Prime Minister, Lester B. Pearson, asked the famous question, \\"What does Quebec want?\\" as he instituted a royal commission of enquiry into bilingualism and biculturalism to find an answer for this question, and to propose measures to satisfy the demands of the Qu√©b√©cois. French-speaking communities beyond Quebec were also pushing for increased linguistic and cultural accommodations; in 1965 the report of the Laurendeau- Dunton royal commission recommended making French an official language in the parliaments of Canada, the provincial assemblies of Ontario and New Brunswick, in federal tribunals and in all federal government administration of Canada. The implementation of the proposed measures only increased the divide between English Canada and Quebec francophones. English Canadians considered the measures put in place to be unacceptable concessions to francophones, while francophones considered the measures an insufficient response to their aspirations. Throughout these constant frictions between the federal government and the provincial government, the Quebec nationalist movement transformed itself into an independence movement. The Ralliement national (RN), led by Gilles Gr√©goire, and the Rassemblement pour l'ind√©pendance nationale (RIN), led by Pierre Bourgault and Hubert Aquin, were founded in 1960 and quickly became political parties. In 1967, Ren√© L√©vesque, who until then had been a leading figure in the Liberal Party of Quebec, quit the Liberals to found the Mouvement Souverainet√©-Association (MSA). In 1968, the separatist forces reorganized into a single political party, the Parti Qu√©b√©cois, under the leadership of Ren√© L√©vesque. Separatist parties gained 8% of the popular vote in Quebec in 1966, 23% in 1970 and 30% in 1973. These results were not strong enough to result in a majority in Quebec's provincial assembly, but they showed the rapid development of a separatist ideology in Quebec. 1970‚Äì1980 Construction of an access road to the James Bay Project, one of the world's largest hydroelectric projects, 1972. Traditional values continued to be put into question, in particular at the moral and religious level. Every form of authority was questioned, and demonstrations by students and workers' unions were frequent. A noticeable, growing confidence was evident in Quebec, supported by economic and social successes. After a period of rapid change, Quebec paused to search for its path. A period of fast economic growth was ending. Several factors contributed to the stagnation and even the reduction, in many cases, of the buying power of Qu√©b√©cois: *the gas price shocks of 1973‚Äì1974 and of 1979 generated price inflation and high interest rates; *economic growth shrank; *taxes increased to pay for government programs put in place during the period 1960‚Äì1975; *governments, struggling with spending and growing deficits, disengaged itself from some services that citizens now had to pay for out of their own pocket; *globalization of the economy put downward pressure on salaries. Quebec's Premier Robert Bourassa unveiled plans for the James Bay Project in 1971.Desbiens, Caroline. Power from the North: Territory, Identity, and the Culture of Hydroelectricity in Quebec (2014) It expanded the capacity of Hydro-Qu√©bec by creating one of the largest hydro-electric projects in the world and eventually created a new understanding of the relationship between Quebec and the Cree Nation.Hamley, W. (1993). \\"Native Land Claims in Quebec Considered in a Canadian Context\\". Geografiska Annaler, 75(2), 93‚Äì109 Tensions with aboriginal groups were to re-emerge in the 1990s during the Oka Crisis Standoffs in Kanesatake and Kahnawake. =1980 referendum= In 1976, the separatist Parti Qu√©b√©cois under Ren√© L√©vesque was elected, and formed the first separatist government of the province. The Parti Qu√©b√©cois promised in its campaign that it would not declare independence without obtaining a mandate through a referendum. The mandate of the Parti Qu√©b√©cois was to govern the province well, and not to bring about independence. The first years of the Parti Qu√©b√©cois government were very productive and the government passed progressive laws that were well accepted by the majority of the population, such as French language protection laws, a law on the financing of political parties, laws for compensating road accident victims, for protecting farm land, and many other social-democracy-type laws. Even opponents of the Parti Qu√©b√©cois occasionally acknowledged that the Party governed the province well. On May 20, 1980, the first referendum was held on sovereignty-association, but was rejected by a majority of 60 percent (59.56% \\"No\\", 40.44% \\"Yes\\"). 1980‚Äì2000 =Constitution Act, 1982= Together with the Canada Act 1982, an Act of Parliament passed by the British Parliament severed virtually all remaining constitutional and legislative ties between the United Kingdom and Canada. The Act was signed by all the provinces except Quebec. On the night of November 4, 1981, (widely known among Quebec sovereigntists as La nuit des longs couteaux and in the rest of Canada as the \\"Kitchen Accord\\") Federal Justice Minister Jean Chr√©tien met with all of the provincial premiers except Ren√© L√©vesque to sign the document that would eventually become the new Canadian constitution. The next morning, they presented the \\"fait accompli\\" to L√©vesque. L√©vesque refused to sign the document and returned to Quebec. In 1982, Trudeau had the new constitution approved by the British Parliament, with Quebec's signature still missing (a situation that persists to this day). The Supreme Court of Canada confirmed Trudeau's assertion that every province's approval is not required to amend the constitution. Quebec is the only province not to have formally assented to the patriation of the Canadian constitution in 1982. Meech Lake Accord and Charlottetown Accord In a speech delivered on June 22, 1990, in the National Assembly of Quebec following the failure of the Meech Lake Accord, Robert Bourassa stated, \\"English Canada must understand very clearly that, no matter what anyone says and no matter what anyone does, Quebec is, today and forever, a distinct society, free and capable of assuming its destiny and development. Thank you.\\" The Meech Lake Accord and Charlottetown Accord negotiated during Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's government were attempts to reconcile Quebec and persuade it to sign the Canada Act; however, concessions to Quebec were considered unacceptable to many in the mainly English-speaking parts of Canada, who voted to reject the Charlottetown Accord. The failure of the Accord was a precipitating factor in the separatists' momentum moving towards the 1995 referendum. =Oka Crisis= The Oka Crisis was a land dispute between a group of Mohawk people and the town of Oka beginning on July 11, 1990, and lasted until September 26, 1990. One person died as a result. The dispute was the first well-publicized violent conflict between First Nations and the Quebec government in the late 20th century. The crisis developed from a local dispute between the town of Oka and the Mohawk community of Kanesatake. The town of Oka was developing plans to expand a golf course and residential development onto land which had traditionally been used by the Mohawk. It included pineland and a burial ground, marked by standing tombstones of their ancestors. The Mohawks had filed a land claim for the sacred grove and burial ground near Kanesatake, but their claim had been rejected in 1986. On August 8, Quebec premier Robert Bourassa had announced at a press conference that he had invoked Section 275 of the National Defence Act to requisition military support in \\"aid of the civil power\\", a right available to provincial governments. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney was reluctant to have the federal government and, in particular, the army, so involved. Under the act however, the solicitor general of the province, under direction from Premier Robert Bourassa, had the right to requisition the armed forces to maintain law and order as a provincial responsibility; this move had precedent in Canada, including two decades earlier during the October Crisis. =1995 referendum= Downtown Montreal today, seen from Mount Royal. On October 30, 1995, a second referendum for Quebec sovereignty was rejected by a slim margin (50.58% \\"No\\", 49.42% \\"Yes\\"). Instrumental leaders of the Quebec separatist side were Lucien Bouchard and Quebec Premier Jacques Parizeau. Bouchard had left the senior ranks of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservative government to form Canada's first federal separatist party (the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois) in 1991 and had become the leader of the Opposition after the 1993 federal election. He campaigned heavily for the \\"Yes\\" side against Liberal Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien, a major proponent of the federalist \\"No\\" side. Parizeau, a longtime separatist who had played an important role in the 1980 referendum, promised a referendum for sovereignty in his electoral campaign leading up to the 1994 provincial election, which had earned him a majority government in the province. In the aftermath of the referendum, he faced criticism when he blamed the loss of the referendum on \\"money and the ethnic vote\\" in his concession speech. Parizeau resigned as Premier and as leader of the Parti qu√©b√©cois the day after his controversial speech, claiming he had always planned to do so in the case of separatist defeat, and Bouchard left federal politics to replace him in January 1996. Federalists accused the sovereigntist side of asking a vague, overcomplicated question on the ballot. Its English text read as follows: > Do you agree that Qu√©bec should become sovereign after having made a formal > offer to Canada for a new economic and political partnership within the > scope of the bill respecting the future of Qu√©bec and of the agreement > signed on June 12, 1995? 2000‚Äìpresent Former Premier of Quebec Pauline Marois, campaigning before the September 2012 provincial election. After winning the provincial election in 1998, Bouchard retired from politics in 2001. Bernard Landry was then appointed leader of the Parti Qu√©b√©cois and premier of Quebec. In 2003, Landry lost the election to the Quebec Liberal Party and Jean Charest. Landry stepped down as PQ leader in 2005, and in a crowded race for the party leadership, Andr√© Boisclair was elected to succeed him. He also resigned after the renewal of the Quebec Liberal Party's government in the 2007 general election and the Parti Qu√©b√©cois becoming the second opposition party, behind the Action D√©mocratique. On November 27, 2006, the House of Commons of Canada passed a motion recognizing that the \\"Qu√©b√©cois form a nation within a united Canada.\\" The motion was introduced in the House of Commons by the federal government. Quebec elected Pauline Marois as its first female premier on September 4, 2012. Marois served as leader of the separatist Parti Qu√©b√©cois. The Parti Qu√©b√©cois was elected with a minority of seats in the province's legislative assembly, with remaining seats held by two federalist (non-separatist) parties. Shortly after the election, during a radio network interview in France, Marois stated that another referendum was not conceivable in the current circumstances, although she emphasized that she would support Quebec's interests. Marois called a provincial election for April 2014, during which her party was defeated by the Parti lib√©ral du Qu√©bec (PLQ). The PLQ won by a large margin, securing a majority government. In the 2018 Quebec general election, the Coalition Avenir Qu√©bec defeated the Liberals, forming a majority government. Fran√ßois Legault is the current Premier. In May 2017, floods spread across southern Quebec, with Montreal declaring a state of emergency.

Located astride the border between Washoe and Pershing counties, it was a shallow lake until the 1930s, but was dried when a dam and a road were built that combined to restrict and block water flow. It was formerly designated as a National Wildlife Refuge, but its status as a refuge was removed due to the lack of water. Winnemucca Lake is home to several petroglyphs long believed to be very old. In 2013, researchers dated the carvings to between 14,800 and 10,500 years ago. Either date would make them the oldest known petroglyphs found in North America. The carvings lie within the Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation. Geography Winnemucca Lake is a sub- basin within the Lahontan Basin in northwestern Nevada. It lies east of Pyramid Lake and is on the dividing line between Washoe and Pershing counties. The lake bed lies between the Lake Range on the west and the Nightingale Mountains and Selenite Range to the east. Winnemucca Lake is about long and about wide. The lake bed is at an elevation of ,Kumiva Peak, Nevada‚ÄîCalifornia, 30x60 Topographic Quadrangle, USGS, 1984.Reno, Nevada‚ÄîCalifornia, 30x60 Topographic Quadrangle, USGS, 1980. which is below the water level of adjacent Pyramid Lake. History Winnemucca Lake may have been dry when John Fr√©mont came through in 1843‚Äì44. Fr√©mont's 1844 map indicates that he traveled to the west of Winnemucca Lake and does not map the Winnemucca Lake valley. The Elko Free Press reports that there was a flood in 1862 that filled the lake to , but Russell states that the level was low in 1862. In 1865, Winnemucca Lake (then known as Mud Lake) was the site of the Battle of Mud Lake where 29 soldiers from the 1st Nevada Volunteer Cavalry Battalion led by Captain Almond B. Wells (and two civilian guides) killed 29 Smoke Creek Indians. At least two of those killed were women, possibly more. Sarah Winnemucca wrote \\"I had one baby brother killed there. My sister jumped on father's best horse and ran away. As she ran the soldiers ran after her but thanks be to the Good Father in the Spirit land my dear sister got away. This almost killed my poor papa.\\" The maximum level of the lake was in the 1880s Winnemucca Lake was a shallow tule-filled lake and an important stop for migrating waterfowl. After the Derby Dam was built on the Truckee River in 1903 (the first project of the Reclamation Act), and State Route 447 (which blocked the slough connecting it to Pyramid Lake) was built, Winnemucca Lake dried out and has remained seasonally dry since the late 1930s. In 1936, Franklin D. Roosevelt invoked the Migratory Bird Conservation Act to create the Winnemucca Migratory Bird Refuge as a \\"refuge and breeding ground for migratory birds and other wildlife.\\" In 1940, the name was changed to the Winnemucca National Wildlife Refuge. In 1962, the refuge designation was removed, making this area the first refuge designation lost because of lack of water. Petroglyphs The western end of Winnemucca Lake is home to several boulders carved with petroglyphs that lie within the Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation. The site, officially designated 26Wa3329, was first described by Connick and Connick in 1992. The team, Frances and Robert E. Connick, classified it as unusual, and possibly very early. In 1994, geochemist Larry Benson determined the designs had been carved into a branch form of tufa, a type of limestone. The research showed that the limestone was deposited between 16,200 and 14,800 years ago, but no specific date for the carvings was suggested. In 2013, a team of researchers from the University of Colorado at Boulder (including Benson) collected carbonate crust and shallow-water algal formations from the site. They then used radiocarbon dating strontium isotope analysis and total inorganic carbon data from a core in Pyramid Lake to establish a window of when the lake level was low enough to allow access to the rocks. Sedimentary cores were collected from nearby Pyramid Lake and subjected to analysis to determine rise and fall of the waterline over time. More precise methods of dating would have required taking scrapings from the grooves of the petroglyphs, which was not allowed by the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe. However, Benson was allowed to use non-invasive techniques to examine the petroglyphs that allowed him to work to the side of the carvings. The research was published in the Journal of Archaeological Science. Dating of the lowest (newest) carbonate crust yielded a date of 10,200 to 9,800 years ago. The algal formation dating suggested the waterline was sufficiently low from 12,600 to 11,400 years ago. The sedimentary core analysis of Pyramid Lake showed the waterline began to fall about 15,000 years ago, reaching a low approximately 13,300 years ago. At about 13,200 years ago it rose again, and had intermittent low periods thereafter (from 11,300 to 10,500 according to one method, or from 11,500 to 11,100 according to another). The broad consistencies among the various dating methods allowed the research team to conclude the petroglyph rocks were above the waterline, and thus available for carving, from 14,800 and 13,200 years ago and between 11,300 and 10,500 years ago. Additionally, the younger date range is consistent with the date of textiles previously found within the Winnemucca sub-basin (dated as old as 10,700 years ago) and the date of various human artifacts previously found within the Lahontan Basin (dated from 11,000 to 10,400 years ago). The younger dates also align with the estimated age of the Spirit Cave mummy found nearby. Either date range would make the petroglyphs the oldest found in North America to date. The older date would roughly correspond to the estimated time of the first human migrations into North America and to remains found in Paisley Cave, Oregon. Previously, the oldest carvings in North America were thought to be those estimated to be 7,300 years old found at Long Lake, in Oregon. The rocks include both simple petroglyphs such as straight lines and swirls and more complex petroglyphs that resemble trees, flowers, or the veins of a leaf. There also is an intricate diamond pattern on one rock. The smallest are approximately in width, while the largest are . Grooves are approximately deep. The carvings are deeper and larger than those typically found in the Southwestern United States. The meaning of the carvings is unknown. The Connick team suggested the petroglyphs may represent meteorological symbols such as clouds and lightning. Benson's team suggests the Winnemucca Lake petroglyphs share several distinctive features in common with the Long Lake petroglyphs that are not found in more recent petroglyphs. How the petroglyphs were created is not known. One possibility is that hard volcanic rock was used to chip away at the softer carbonate formations on the boulders.

He associated with the Rockingham Whigs and rose to hold the post of Southern Secretary for a brief period. He was noteworthy for his support for the colonists during the American Revolutionary War, his support for a policy of concession in Ireland and his advanced views on the issue of parliamentary reform. He went on to be a reforming Master-General of the Ordnance first in the Rockingham ministry and then in the ministry of William Pitt. Origins He was the son and heir of Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond of Goodwood and of Richmond House, by his wife Sarah Cadogan, a daughter of William Cadogan, 1st Earl Cadogan.Heathcote, p.199 Career He was educated at Westminster School and Leiden University and succeeded his father as Duke of Richmond in August 1750. He was commissioned as an ensign in the 2nd Foot Guards in March 1752, promoted to captain in the 20th Regiment of Foot on 18 June 1753 and was admitted a Fellow of the Royal Society on 11 December 1755. Richmond became lieutenant colonel of the 33rd Regiment of Foot on 7 June 1756. A second battalion (2nd/33rd) of this regiment was raised and in 1757, and the following year it became an independent regiment, the 72nd Foot; Richmond was appointed its lieutenant colonel, while his younger brother George took command of the 33rd Regiment (1st/33rd). In May 1758 he became colonel of the 72nd Regiment. Richmond took part in the Raid on Cherbourg in August 1758 and served as aide-de-camp to Prince Frederick of Brunswick at the Battle of Minden in August 1759. Promoted to major general on 9 March 1761, he saw the 72nd Regiment disbanded in 1763 at the end of the Seven Years' War.Brereton & Savoury, p. 41 He was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Sussex on 18 October 1763. Richmond was appointed British ambassador extraordinary in Paris and made a Privy Counsellor in 1765, and in the following year he briefly served as Southern Secretary in the Rockingham Whig administration, resigning office on the accession of Pitt the Elder in July 1766. He was promoted to lieutenant general on 30 April 1770Heathcote, p. 200 and was briefly leader of the parliamentary Whigs in opposition in 1771 when Rockingham's wife was ill. Richmond's anti-colonial positions earned him the sobriquet \\"the radical duke.\\" In the debates on the policy that led to the American Revolutionary War Richmond was a firm supporter of the colonists, and he initiated the debate in 1778 calling for the removal of British troops from America, during which Pitt (now the Earl of Chatham) was seized by his fatal illness. He also advocated a policy of concession in Ireland, with reference to which he originated the phrase \\"a union of hearts\\" which long afterwards became famous when his use of it had been forgotten. In 1779 Richmond brought forward a motion for retrenchment of the civil list, and in 1780 he embodied in a bill his proposals for parliamentary reform, which included manhood suffrage, annual parliaments and equal electoral areas. Richmond joined the Second Rockingham Ministry as Master-General of the Ordnance in March 1782; he was appointed a Knight of the Garter on 17 April 1782 and promoted to full general on 20 November 1782. He resigned as Master-General when the Fox‚ÄìNorth coalition came to power in April 1783. In January 1784 he joined the First Pitt the Younger Ministry as Master-General of the Ordnance; in this role he reformed the Department, introducing salaries for office holders, starting a survey of the South Coast (which led to the formation of the Ordnance Survey) and introducing new artillery (leading to the formation of the Royal Horse Artillery). He now developed strongly Tory opinions, and his alleged desertion of the cause of reform led to accusations of apostasy, and an attack on him by Lord Lauderdale in 1792, which nearly led to a duel. In November 1795, when Thomas Hardy and John Horne Tooke were charged with treason and cited his publications on reform in their defence, Richmond became a liability to the Government and was dismissed in February 1795. He became colonel of the Royal Horse Guards on 18 July 1795 and was promoted to field marshal on 30 July 1796. On 15 June 1797 he raised a Yeomanry artillery troop, the Duke of Richmond's Light Horse Artillery at his estate at Goodwood. The troop was equipped with his own design of Curricle gun carriage.Barlow & Smith, p. 7. In retirement Richmond built the famous racecourse at the family seat of Goodwood. He was also a patron of artists such as George Stubbs, Pompeo Batoni, Anton Raphael Mengs, Joshua Reynolds and George Romney.

The 3rd Duke referred to her in his will as \\"Miss Henrietta Anne le Clerc, who resides with me and though Christened by the name of Anne only, is called Henrietta and whom I have [educated?] from her childhood\\", and bequeathed her an annual income of ¬£2,000. In 1778, aged 5, Henriette had been brought from France by the Duke's sister Lady Louisa Conolly, to live at Goodwood House. It was in Henrietta's bedroom in Richmond House in London where in 1791 the fire started which destroyed that building. By the Duke's will she received the life tenure of West Lavant House and Park and other lands and farms on the Goodwood Estate. On 28 March 1808, at St. James's Church, Westminster, she married General John Dorrien (1758-1825), Royal Regiment of Horseguards, by whom she had a son Charles Dorrien. After her husband's death she turned to the management of her estate, where she bred Merino sheep and hunted with Colonel Wyndham's foxhounds.\\"Goodwood: The French Connection\\" Death, burial and succession Richmond died at Goodwood on 29 December 1806 and was buried in nearby Chichester Cathedral in Sussex.

He is sometimes referred to as the \\"Dancing Horse\\", the \\"Thinking Horse\\", or the \\"Politic Horse\\". Origin William Bankes (also spelled Banks or Banckes, and sometimes called Richard Bankes) was born in Staffordshire, probably in the early 1560s, In the 1580s he became a retainer of Robert Devereux, the Earl of Essex; his job may have been working in the stables. The horse that would be named Marocco was born around 1586; most sources agree he was bay, but some record him as white. Soon thereafter he was obtained by Bankes, who named him after the morocco leather from which contemporary saddles were made, and jocularly addressed him as \\"seignior\\" (se√±or). According to modern English physician and writer Jan Bondeson, \\"Marocco was a small, muscular horse with remarkable litheness and agility; he also proved particularly intelligent and easy to educate.\\" London Bankes sold his possessions and used the money to purchase silver horseshoes for Marocco, then moved to London to work at inn-yard theatres. According to Thomas Nashe, Bankes had Marocco's tail bobbed: \\"Wiser was our Brother Bankes of these latter daies, who made his iugling horse a Cut, for feare if at anie time hee should foyst [defecate], the stinke sticking in his thicke bushie taile might be noysome to his Auditors.\\" Bankes lived at the Cross Keys Inn on Gracechurch Street, where their act performed. A passage from Tarlton's Jests (1611) says: Richard Tarlton > The[re] was one Banks, in the time of Tarlton, who served the Erle of Essex, > and had a horse of strange qualities, and being at the Crosse-keyes, in > Gracious streete, getting mony with him, as he was mightily resorted to. > Tarlton then, with his fellowes, playing at the Bel by, came into the Cross- > keyes, amongst many people, to see fashions, which Banks perceiving, to make > the people laugh, saies; seignior, to his horse, go fetch me the veryest > foole in the company. The jade comes immediately, and with his mouth drawes > Tarlton forth. Tarlton with merry words, said nothing but, \\"God a mercy, > horse.\\" In the end Tarlton, seeing the people laugh so, was angry inwardly, > and said: Sir, had I power of your horse as you have, I would doe more than > that. What ere it be, said Banks, to please him, I will charge him to do it. > Then, said Tarleton: charge him bring me the veriest whore-master in the > company. The horse leades his master to him. Then \\"God a mercy horse > indeed,\\" saies Tarlton, The people had much ado to keep peace; but Banks and > Tarlton had like to have squar'd, and the horse by to give aime. But ever > after it was a by word thorow London, God a mercy horse! and is so to this > day. Exactly when Marocco and Bankes moved to London is unknown, but for Richard Tarlton (a renowned clown) to have seen the act, they must have arrived before Tarlton's death in September 1588. Bondeson has suggested that the entire episode with Tarlton was staged to garner publicity. Marocco could walk on two and three legs and play dead. He could pull out particular audience members‚Äîsuch as people wearing spectacles‚Äîon Bankes's command; he could distinguish between colors, such as green and violet (horses are only partially colorblind). In one stunt, the horse drank a large bucket of water, then urinated on Bankes's command. In another, he was told to pick out the \\"maids\\" (virgins) from the \\"maulkins\\" (harlots) in the audience. When ordered to bow to the queen, Elizabeth I, Marocco was trained to do so; when ordered to bow to Philip II (King of Spain), the horse was trained to bare its teeth, whinny, and chase Bankes offstage. This stunt was soon thereafter imitated by other animal trainers. By 1593, John Donne had written: > But to a graue man, he doth moue no more Than the wise politique horse would > heretofore, Or thou, O Elephant, or Ape, wilt doe, When any names the k[ing] > of Spaine to you. Whether by sleight-of-hand or by the horse's own talent, Marocco was known for his unusual counting abilities. Coins could be collected from the audience, and Marocco would indicate to whom each coin belonged and, with stomps of his hoof, how many coins had come from each. Contemporary poet John Bastard wrote: > Bankes hath a horse of wondrous qualitie For he can fight, and pisse, and > daunce, and lie, And finde your purse, and tell what coyne ye haue: But > Bankes, who taught your horse to smel a knaue? By the mid-1590s Marocco and Bankes had become some of London's most popular entertainers; Bankes was now wealthy, living and performing at the Bell Savage Inn, where Marocco was kept in the stables. Eventually Bankes had an arena built on Gracechurch Street just for their act. A musician was employed who played a song called \\"Bankes's Game\\" during the act, and who entertained the audience between shows. Although the tune and lyrics have not been preserved, the song \\"The Praise of a Pretty Lass; or, The Young Man's Dissimulation\\", published sometime in the early 17th century, follows the same tune. The first verse goes: > Young men and maidens, to you Ile [I'll] declare, I love my love, and she > loveth me: Yet to no goddesse will I her compare, And yet she is pretty > indifferent faire: Will O, my love, O, there is none doth know How I doe > love thee. In addition, a ballad was published on 14 November 1595 by pamphleteer Edward White called \\"A ballad shewing the strange qualities of a yong nagg called Morocco\\", which is now lost. Old St Paul's Cathedral, as it appeared in the 17th century In 1601, perhaps to fight the growing competition of other animal trainers, Bankes and Marocco ascended over a thousand steps to the rooftop of the then-flat St Paul's Cathedral and performed the act. The show was a success, and even the clergy came out to watch the performance. Then, to the great astonishment of those watching, Marocco walked down the flight of stairs and out onto the street. Writer Thomas Dekker wrote in The Guls Hornebooke (1609): > From hence you may descend to talke about the horse that went up, and striue > if you can to know his keeper, take the day of the moneth, and the number of > the steppes,‚Äîand suffer your selfe to beleeue verily that it was not a > horse, but something else in the likeness of one. Travels and death As the act's popularity grew, Bankes took it beyond London. Historian Patrick Henderson wrote in his History of Scotland (1596): \\"There came an Englishman to Edinburgh, with a chestain-coloured naig, which he called Marroco. [‚Ä¶] He made him to do many rare and uncouth tricks, such as never horse was observed to do the like before in this land.\\" A journal entry from Shrewsbury in 1591 relates: > September 1591, 33 Eliz. This yeare and against the assise tyme on Master > Banckes, a Staffordshire gentile, brought into this town of Salop a white > horsse whiche wolld doe woonderfull and strange thinges, as thesse,‚Äîwold in > a company or prese tell howe many peeces of money by hys foote were in a > mans purce; also, yf the partie his master wolld name any man beinge hyd > never so secret in the company, wold fatche hym owt with his mowthe, either > naming hym the veriest knave in the company, or what cullerid coate he hadd; > he pronowncid further to his horse and said, Sirha, there be two baylyves in > the towne, the one of them bid mee welcom unto this towne and usid me in > frindly maner; I wold have the goe to hym and gyve hym thanckes for mee; and > he wold goe truly to the right baylyf that did so use hys sayd master as he > did in the sight of a number of people, unto Master Baylyffe Sherar, and > bowyd unto hym in makinge curchey withe hys foote in sutche maner as he > coullde, withe suche strange feates for sutche a beast to doe, that many > people judgid that it were impossible to be don except he had a famyliar or > don by the arte of magicke. In March 1601, Bankes, Marocco, and their musician travelled to Paris and moved into the Lion d'Argent Inn on Rue Saint-Jacques. Here Marocco became known as \\"Monsieur Moraco\\", and became immensely popular. A Parisian official finally arrested Bankes and charged him with sorcery, forcing Bankes to reveal that many of the tricks were accomplished through subtle hand gestures. Marocco, Bankes, and the musician moved on to Orl√©ans, where their show was also met with success until Bankes was again arrested and sentenced to burn at the stake. Bankes was given a last show to redeem himself, and during the performance Marocco knelt down before a cross held by one of the priests of the city, \\"proving\\" he was not of the devil. When Bankes left Orl√©ans, he was given \\"money and great commendations\\" for his troubles. Marocco's show continued to tour Europe, stopping in Frankfurt, Lisbon, Rome, and Wolfenb√ºttel as late as 1605. Marocco probably died around 1606. After Marocco's death. Bankes revealed the secrets of his training to Gervase Markham, who published them in his book Cavelarice (1607). In 1608 Bankes was hired to work in James I's stables, and later trained horses for George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham. He married and had a daughter, and was known for his wealth and wit in his old age. Late in life he became a well known innkeeper, and died c. 1641.

Cronin was born in Chicago, Illinois, and attended Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas. He and co-researcher Val Logsdon Fitch were awarded the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physics for a 1964 experiment that proved that certain subatomic reactions do not adhere to fundamental symmetry principles. Specifically, they proved, by examining the decay of kaons, that a reaction run in reverse does not merely retrace the path of the original reaction, which showed that the interactions of subatomic particles are not invariant under time reversal. Thus the phenomenon of CP violation was discovered. Cronin received the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award in 1976 for major experimental contributions to particle physics including fundamental work on weak interactions culminating in the discovery of asymmetry under time reversal. In 1999, he was awarded the National Medal of Science.National Science Foundation - The President's National Medal of Science Cronin was Professor Emeritus at the University of Chicago winning the prestigious Quantrell Award and a spokesperson emeritus for the Auger project. He was a member of the Board of Sponsors of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. Education and early life James Cronin was born on September 29, 1931. His father, James Farley Cronin, was a graduate student of classical languages at the University of Chicago. After his father had obtained his doctorate the family first moved to Alabama, and later in 1939 to Dallas, Texas, where his father became a professor of Latin and Greek at Southern Methodist University. After high school Cronin stayed in Dallas and obtained an undergraduate degree at Southern Methodist University in physics and mathematics in 1951. For graduate school Cronin moved back to Illinois to attend the University of Chicago. His teachers there included Nobel Prize laureates Enrico Fermi, Maria Mayer, Murray Gell-Mann and Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. He wrote his thesis on experimental nuclear physics under supervision of Samuel K. Allison. Research and career After obtaining his doctorate in 1955, Cronin joined the group of Rodney L. Cool and Oreste Piccioni at Brookhaven National Laboratory, where the new Cosmotron particle accelerator had just been completed. There he started to study parity violation in the decay of hyperon particles. During that time he also met Val Fitch, who brought him to Princeton University in Fall 1958. After Cosmotron underwent magnet failure, Cronin and the Brookhaven group moved to Bevatron at the University of California, Berkeley during the first half of 1958. Cronin and Fitch studied the decays of neutral K mesons, in which they discovered CP violation in 1964. This discovery earned the duo the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physics. After the discovery, Cronin spent a year in France at the Centre d'√âtudes Nucl√©aires at Saclay. After returning to Princeton he continued studying the neutral CP violating decay modes of the long-lived neutral K meson. In 1971, he moved back to the University of Chicago to become a full professor. This was attractive for him because of a new 400 GeV particle accelerator being built at nearby Fermilab. When he moved to Chicago, he began a long series of experiments on particle production at high transverse momentum. With physicist Pierre Piroue and colleagues we learned about many things. These are summarized in Physical Review D, vol 19, page 764 (1977). Following these experiments Cronin took a sabbatical at CERN in 1982‚Äì83, where he performed an experiment to measure of the lifetime of the neutral pion (Physics Letters vol 158 B page 81, 1985). He then switched to the study of cosmic rays. The first was a series of measurements looking for point sources of cosmic rays. No sources were found. A summary of the measurements was published in Physical Review D vol 55 page 1714 (1997). In 1998 he joined the faculty at the University of Utah on a half-time basis to work on ultra-high- energy cosmic ray physics and to jumpstart the Pierre Auger Observatory project. His appointment was to last five years, but he left after a year to continue gathering international support for the Observatory with Alan Watson and Murat Boratav. Cronin is one of the 20 American recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics to sign a letter addressed to President George W. Bush in May of 2008, urging him to \\"reverse the damage done to basic science research in the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill\\" by requesting additional emergency funding for the Department of Energy‚Äôs Office of Science, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. =Publications= *Banner, M.; Cronin, J.

Specifically, they proved, by examining the decay of K-mesons, that a reaction run in reverse does not retrace the path of the original reaction, which showed that the reactions of subatomic particles are not indifferent to time. Thus the phenomenon of CP violation was discovered. This demolished the faith that physicists had that natural laws were governed by symmetry. Born on a cattle ranch near Merriman, Nebraska, Fitch was drafted into the U.S. Army during World War II, and worked on the Manhattan Project at the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico. He later graduated from McGill University, and completed his Ph.D. in physics in 1954 at Columbia University. He was a member of the faculty at Princeton University from 1954 until his retirement in 2005. Early life Val Logsdon Fitch was born on a cattle ranch near Merriman, Nebraska, on March 10, 1923, the youngest of three children of Fred Fitch, a cattle rancher, and his wife Frances n√©e Logsdon, a school teacher. He had an older brother and sister. The family farm was about in size. The ranch was small; his father specialized in raising breeding stock. Soon after his birth, his father was badly injured in a horse riding accident and could no longer work on his ranch, so the family moved to the nearby town of Gordon, Nebraska, where his father entered the insurance business. Here he attended school, graduating from Gordon High School in 1940 as valedictorian. Manhattan Project Fitch attended Chadron State College for three years, then transferred to Northwestern University. This was during WWII; his studies were interrupted by being drafted into the US Army in 1943. After completing basic training, he was sent to Carnegie Institute of Technology for training under the Army Specialized Training Program. Under this program, some 200,000 soldiers attended colleges for intensive courses. Fitch was in the program for less than a year before the manpower requirements of the war became too great, and the Army terminated the program. Most of the soldiers in the ASTP were posted to combat units, but Fitch was one of a hundred or so ASTP soldiers who joined the Special Engineer Detachment (SED), which provided much-needed technicians to the Manhattan Project. The Army sent Fitch to the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico. By mid-1944, about a third of the technicians at Los Alamos were from the SED. There he met many of the greats of physics including Niels Bohr, James Chadwick, Enrico Fermi, Isidor Isaac Rabi, Bruno Rossi, Emilio Segr√®, Edward Teller and Richard C. Tolman, in some cases attending physics courses taught by them. He worked in the group headed by Ernest Titterton, a member of the British Mission, and became well- acquainted with the techniques of experimental physics. He participated in the drop testing of mock atomic bombs that was conducted at Wendover Army Air Field and the Naval Auxiliary Air Station Salton Sea, and worked at the Trinity site, where he witnessed the Trinity nuclear test on July 16, 1945. He was discharged from the Army in 1946. He continued to work at Los Alamos as a civilian for another year to earn money. He briefly returned to Los Alamos in summer 1948. Academic career His wartime experiences led Fitch to decide to become a physicist. Robert Bacher, the head of the physics division at Los Alamos, offered him a graduate assistantship at Cornell University, but first he needed to complete his undergraduate degree. Rather than return to Northwestern or Carnegie Mellon, he elected to enter McGill University, which Titterton had recommended. Fitch graduated from McGill with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering in 1948. On the advice of Jerry Kellogg, who had been a student of Rabi's at Columbia University, and was a division head at the Los Alamos, Fitch decided to pursue his doctoral studies at Columbia. Kellogg wrote him a letter of introduction to Rabi. James Rainwater became his academic supervisor. Rainwater gave him a paper by John Wheeler concerning mu- mesic atoms, atoms in which an electron is replaced by a muon. These had never been observed; they were completely theoretical and there was no evidence that they existed, but it made a good thesis topic. Fitch designed and built an experiment to measure the gamma rays emitted from mu-mesic atoms. As it turned out, this was a good time to search for them. Columbia had recently commissioned a cyclotron at the Nevis Laboratories that could produce muons; Robert Hofstadter had developed the thallium-activated sodium iodide gamma ray detector; and wartime advances in electronics yielded advances in components such as new phototubes needed to bring it all together. Initially nothing was found, but Rainwater suggested expanding the search beyond the energy range predicted by Wheeler on the basis of the then-accepted size of the radius of the atomic nucleus as around 1.4 √ó 10‚àí15 m. When this was done, they found what they had been looking for, discovering in the process that the nucleus was closer to 1.2 √ó 10‚àí15 m. He completed his Ph.D. in 1954, writing his thesis on \\"Studies of X-rays from mu-mesonic atoms\\". The thesis was published in the Physical Review in November 1953. In 1949, Fitch married Elise Cunningham, a secretary who worked in the laboratory at Columbia. They had two sons. Elise died in 1972, and in 1976 he married Daisy Harper Sharp, thereby acquiring two stepdaughters and a stepson. After obtaining his doctorate, Fitch's interest shifted to strange particles and K mesons. In 1954, he joined the physics faculty at Princeton University, where he spent the rest of his career. He was the Class of 1909 Professor of Physics from 1969 to 1976, the Cyrus Fogg Brackett Professor of Physics from 1976 to 1982, and the James S. McDonnell Distinguished University Professor of Physics from 1982 to 1993, when he retired and took up the position of visiting lecturer with the rank of professor for three years before entering emeritus status. He was chair of the physics department from 1976 to 1981. Fitch conducted much of his research at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, where he became acquainted with James Cronin. The two of them played bridge at nights while they waited for the Cosmotron to become available. Cronin had built a new kind of detector, a spark chamber spectrometer, and Fitch realized that it would be perfect for experiments with K mesons (now known as kaons), which Yale University physicist Robert Adair had suggested had interesting properties worth investigating. They could decay into either matter or antimatter. Along with two colleagues, James Christenson and Ren√© Turlay, they set up their experiment on the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron at Brookhaven. They discovered an unexpected result. The decay of neutral K mesons did not respect CP symmetry. K mesons that decayed into positrons did so faster than those that decayed into electrons. The importance of this result was not immediately appreciated; but as evidence of the Big Bang accumulated, Andrei Sakharov realized in 1967 that it explained why the universe is largely made of matter and not antimatter. Put simply, they had found \\"the answer to the physicist's 'Why do we exist?'\\" For this discovery, Fitch and Cronin received the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physics. In addition to the Nobel Prize, Fitch received the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award in 1968, the John Price Wetherill Medal in 1976 and the National Medal of Science in 1993. He was a member of the Board of Sponsors of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and the JASON defense advisory group. He was elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society in 1964 and a Member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1966. In 1981, Fitch became a founding member of the World Cultural Council and received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. He was president of the American Physical Society from 1988 to 1989, and he served on a number of governmental science and science policy committees, including the President's Science Advisory Committee from 1970 to 1973. Fitch is one of the 20 American recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics to sign a letter addressed to President George W. Bush in May of 2008, urging him to \\"reverse the damage done to basic science research in the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill\\" by requesting additional emergency funding for the Department of Energy‚Äôs Office of Science, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. He died at his home in Princeton, New Jersey, at the age of 91 on February 5, 2015.

During his career, he was a professor at Harvard University and later at the University of Arizona and at Leiden University in 1973 (as Lorentz Professor). Bloembergen shared the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physics with Arthur Schawlow, along with Kai Siegbahn for his laser spectroscopy work. Early life Bloembergen was born in Dordrecht on March 11, 1920, where his father was a chemical engineer and executive.Nobel Foundation Nicolaas Bloembergen He had five siblings, with his brother Auke later becoming a legal scholar. In 1938, Bloembergen entered the University of Utrecht to study physics. However, during World War II, the German authorities closed the university and Bloembergen spent two years in hiding. Career =Graduate studies= Bloembergen left the war-ravaged Netherlands in 1945 to pursue graduate studies at Harvard University under Professor Edward Mills Purcell. Through Purcell, Bloembergen was part of the prolific academic lineage tree of J. J. Thomson, which includes many other Nobel Laureates, beginning with Thomson himself (Physics Nobel, 1906) and Lord Rayleigh (Physics Nobel, 1904), Ernest Rutherford (Chemistry Nobel 1908), Owen Richardson (Physics Nobel, 1928), and finally Purcell (Physics, Nobel 1952). Bloembergen's other influences include John Van Vleck (Physics Nobel, 1977) and Percy Bridgman (Physics Nobel, 1946). Six weeks before his arrival, Purcell and his graduate students Torrey and Pound discovered nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Bloembergen was hired to develop the first NMR machine. At Harvard he attended lectures by Schwinger, Van Vleck, and Kemble. Bloembergen's NMR systems are the predecessors of modern-day MRI machines, which are used to examine internal organs and tissues. Bloembergen's research on NMR led to an interest in masers, which were introduced in 1953 and are the predecessors of lasers. Bloembergen returned to the Netherlands in 1947, and submitted his thesis Nuclear Magnetic Relaxation at the University of Leiden. This was because he had completed all the preliminary examinations in the Netherlands, and Cor Gorter of Leiden offered him a postdoctoral appointment there. He received his Ph.D. degree from Leiden in 1948, and then was a postdoc at Leiden for about a year. =Professorship= In 1949, he returned to Harvard as a Junior Fellow of the Society of Fellows. In 1951, he became an associate professor; he then became Gordon McKay Professor of Applied Physics in 1957; Rumford Professor of Physics in 1974; and Gerhard Gade University Professor in 1980. In 1990 he retired from Harvard. In addition, Bloembergen served as a visiting professor. From 1964 to 1965, Bloembergen was a visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1996‚Äì1997, he was a visiting scientist at the College of Optical Sciences of the University of Arizona; he became a professor at Arizona in 2001.OSC Faculty Nicolaas Bloembergen Bloembergen was a member of the Board of Sponsors of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and Honorary Editor of the Journal of Nonlinear Optical Physics & Materials.World Scientific. Journal of Nonlinear Optical Physics & Materials. Journal Editorial Board. =Laser spectroscopy= By 1960 while at Harvard, he experimented with microwave spectroscopy. Bloembergen had modified the maser of Charles Townes, and in 1956, Bloembergen developed a crystal maser, which was more powerful than the standard gaseous version. With the advent of the laser, he participated in the development of the field of laser spectroscopy, which allows precise observations of atomic structure using lasers. Following the development of second-harmonic generation by Peter Franken and others in 1961, Bloembergen expanded on the study of the theoretical study of nonlinear optics, the analysis of how photons in high-intensity electromagnetic radiation interact with matter. In reflection to his work in a Dutch newspaper in 1990, Bloembergen said: \\"We took a standard textbook on optics and for each section we asked ourselves what would happen if the intensity was to become very high. We were almost certain that we were bound to encounter an entirely new type of physics within that domain\\". From this theoretical work, Bloembergen found ways to combine two or more laser sources consisting of photons in the visible light frequency range to generate a single laser source with photons of different frequencies in the infrared and ultraviolet ranges, which extends the amount of atomic detail that can be gathered from laser spectroscopy. Awards He was awarded the Lorentz Medal in 1978. He received the Bijvoet Medal of the Bijvoet Center for Biomolecular Research of Utrecht University in 2001. Bloembergen shared the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physics with Arthur Schawlow, along with Kai Siegbahn. The Nobel Foundation awarded Bloembergen and Schawlow \\"for their contribution to the development of laser spectroscopy\\". Personal life and death Bloembergen met Huberta Deliana Brink (Deli) in 1948 while on vacation with his school's Physics Club. She was able to travel with Bloembergen to the United States in 1949 on a student hospitality exchange program; he proposed to her when they arrived in the States, and were married by 1950 on return to Amsterdam. They were both naturalized as citizens of the United States in 1958. They had three children. Bloembergen died on September 5, 2017, at an assisted living facility in his hometown Tucson, Arizona of cardiorespiratory failure, at the age of 97.  Biography  In 2016 a Dutch biography was published, and in 2019 an English one.  Legacy  On the 11th March 2020, the day of Bloembergen‚Äôs 100th birthday, a team of researchers at the University of New South Wales published an article in Nature, demonstrating for the first time the successful coherent control of the nucleus of a single atom using only electric fields, an idea first proposed by Bloembergen back in 1961.

His central insight, which Townes overlooked, was the use of two mirrors as the resonant cavity to take maser action from microwaves to visible wavelengths. He shared the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physics with Nicolaas Bloembergen and Kai Siegbahn for his work using lasers to determine atomic energy levels with great precision. Biography Schawlow was born in Mount Vernon, New York. His mother, Helen (Mason), was from Canada, and his father, Arthur Schawlow, was a Jewish immigrant from Riga (then in the Russian Empire, now in Latvia). Schawlow was raised in his mother's Protestant religion. When Arthur was three years old, they moved to Toronto, Ontario, Canada. At the age of 16, he completed high school at Vaughan Road Academy (then Vaughan Collegiate Institute), and received a scholarship in science at the University of Toronto (Victoria College). After earning his undergraduate degree, Schawlow continued in graduate school at the University of Toronto which was interrupted due to World War II. At the end of the war, he began work on his Ph.D at the university with Professor Malcolm Crawford. He then took a postdoctoral position with Charles H. Townes at the physics department of Columbia University in the fall of 1949. He went on to accept a position at Bell Labs in late 1951. He left in 1961 to join the faculty at Stanford University as a professor. He remained at Stanford until he retired to emeritus status in 1996. Although his research focused on optics, in particular, lasers and their use in spectroscopy, he also pursued investigations in the areas of superconductivity and nuclear resonance. Schawlow shared the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physics with Nicolaas Bloembergen and Kai Siegbahn for their contributions to the development of laser spectroscopy. Schawlow coauthored the widely used text Microwave Spectroscopy (1955) with Charles Townes. Schawlow and Townes were the first to publish the theory of laser design and operation in their seminal 1958 paper on \\"optical masers\\", although Gordon Gould is often credited with the \\"invention\\" of the laser, due to his unpublished work that predated Schawlow and Townes by a few months. The first working laser was made in 1960 by Theodore Maiman. In 1991, the NEC Corporation and the American Physical Society established a prize: the Arthur L. Schawlow Prize in Laser Science. The prize is awarded annually to \\"candidates who have made outstanding contributions to basic research using lasers.\\" Science and religion He participated in science and religion discussions. Regarding God, he stated, \\"I find a need for God in the universe and in my own life.\\" co- edited with Roy Abraham Varghese. This book is mentioned in a December 28, 1992 Time magazine article: Galileo And Other Faithful Scientists Personal life In 1951, he married Aurelia Townes, younger sister of his postdoctoral advisor, Charles Townes. They had three children: Arthur Jr., Helen, and Edith. Arthur Jr. was autistic, with very little speech ability. Schawlow and Professor Robert Hofstadter at Stanford, who also had an autistic child, teamed up to help each other find solutions to the condition. Arthur Jr. was put in a special center for autistic individuals, and later, Schawlow put together an institution to care for people with autism in Paradise, California. It was later named the Arthur Schawlow Center in 1999, shortly before his death on the 29th of April 1999. Schawlow was a promoter of the controversial method of facilitated communication with patients of autism.http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/1999/may5/schawlowobit-55.html] He considered himself to be an orthodox Protestant Christian, and attended a Methodist church. Arthur Schawlow was an intense fan and collector of traditional American jazz recordings, as well as a supporter of instrumental groups performing this type of music. Schawlow died of leukemia in Palo Alto, California.

He was awarded the 1982 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on phase transitions‚Äîilluminating the subtle essence of phenomena like melting ice and emerging magnetism. It was embodied in his fundamental work on the renormalization group. Life Wilson was born on June 8, 1936, in Waltham, Massachusetts, the oldest child of Emily Buckingham Wilson and E. Bright Wilson, a prominent chemist at Harvard University, who did important work on microwave emissions. His mother also trained as a physicist. He attended several schools, including Magdalen College School, Oxford, England, ending up at the George School in eastern Pennsylvania. He went on to Harvard College at age 16, majoring in Mathematics and, on two occasions, ranked among the top five in the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition. He was also a star on the athletics track, representing Harvard in the Mile. During his summer holidays he worked at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. He earned his PhD from Caltech in 1961, studying under Murray Gell-Mann.Wilson, K. G. (1961). \\"An investigation of the Low equation and the Chew-Mandelstam equations\\", Dissertation (Ph.D.), California Institute of Technology. He did post-doc work at Harvard and CERN. He joined Cornell University in 1963 in the Department of Physics as a junior faculty member, becoming a full professor in 1970. He also did research at SLAC during this period.Wilson, K. G. \\"Broken Scale Invariance and Anomalous Dimensions\\", Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC,)Stanford University, Laboratory of Nuclear Studies, Cornell University, United States Department of Energy (through predecessor agency the Atomic Energy Commission), (May 1970). In 1974, he became the James A. Weeks Professor of Physics at Cornell. In 1982 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on critical phenomena using the renormalization group.; ; He was a co-winner of the Wolf Prize in physics in 1980, together with Michael E. Fisher and Leo Kadanoff. His other awards include the A.C. Eringen Medal, the Franklin Medal, the Boltzmann Medal, and the Dannie Heinemann Prize. He was elected a member of the National Academy of Science and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Science, both in 1975, and also was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1984. In 1985, he was appointed as Cornell's Director of the Center for Theory and Simulation in Science and Engineering (now known as the Cornell Theory Center), one of five national supercomputer centers created by the National Science Foundation. In 1988, Wilson joined the faculty at The Ohio State University, moved to Gray, Maine in 1995. He continued his association with Ohio State University until he retired in 2008. Prior to his death, he was actively involved in research on physics education and was an early proponent of \\"active involvement\\" (i.e. Science by Inquiry) of K-12 students in science and math. Some of his PhD students include H. R. Krishnamurthy, Roman Jackiw, Michael Peskin, Serge Rudaz, Paul Ginsparg, and Steven R. White. Wilson's brother David was also a Professor at Cornell in the department of Molecular Biology and Genetics until his death, and his wife since 1982, Alison Brown, is a prominent computer scientist. He died in Saco, Maine on June 15, 2013 at the age of 77. He was respectfully remembered by his colleagues. Work Wilson's work in physics involved formulation of a comprehensive theory of scaling: how fundamental properties and forces of a system vary depending on the scale over which they are measured. He devised a universal \\"divide-and-conquer\\" strategy for calculating how phase transitions occur, by considering each scale separately and then abstracting the connection between contiguous ones, in a novel appreciation of renormalization group theory. This provided profound insights into the field of critical phenomena and phase transitions in statistical physics enabling exact calculations. One example of an important problem in solid-state physics he solved using renormalization is in quantitatively describing the Kondo effect. He then extended these insights on scaling to answer fundamental questions on the nature of quantum field theory and the operator product expansionWilson, K. G.

G.:Problems in physics with many scales of length, Scientific American, August 1979 He also pioneered the understanding of the confinement of quarks inside hadrons, utilizing lattice gauge theory, and initiating an approach permitting formerly foreboding strong-coupling calculations on computers. On such a lattice, he further shed light on chiral symmetry, a crucial feature of elementary particle interactions.
