The series is scheduled to be released as part of the Boomerang IPTV subscription service. This would be the first Flintstones TV series in 24 years since the short-lived series Cave Kids (another Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm-focused spin-off) and the first since the closure of the Hanna-Barbera studio and the deaths of both William Hanna and Joseph Barbera.

In September 2018, the episode The Grass Is Always Dinner was included as part of a survey from Boomerang's newsletter. The episode was later leaked and shared by various websites. It received critical backlash from internet users for its poor storytelling and humor and attempts at trying to appeal to the target demographic such as a scene in where Dino is dabbing.

He wrote, \\"Many individuals, being implicated in theft, insolvency and even crime, get themselves issued with documents from senior mandarins, Princes, and even Your Majesty's wives,certifying to no-one is entitled to pursue them without having first obtained the prior authorization of the Protectorate ... This state of affairs is not compatible with justice in a civilized country.\\" Lafont's complaint was ignored. Lafont was replaced as governor in July 1879 by Charles Le Myre de Vilers.

As a melamed, he wandered around the towns and villages of Bessarabia and neighboring Moldova in search of a living. In the 1920s, he began to compose and perform songs to his own poems in the tradition of wandering Jewish folk singers ( broders ) and badhenes (Velvl Zbarzher, Elyakum Zunzer, Berl Broder, and others). By the 1930s, he had gained extraordinary popularity, despite the lack of publications in Jewish publications. He also wrote melodies to poems of other poets, for example, to the popular elegy \\"Fun shheinishn Dorf\\" ( From a neighboring village ) by Hertz Rivkin . At one time he was a member of the creative organization \\"Kultur-League\\" ( League of Culture ), he wrote and staged amateur plays. It was only in the last years of his life that he began to publish in the \\"Chernovitser Bleter\\" ( Chernivtsi leaflets ) and \\"Ufgang\\" ( Sunrise, Siget ).

The H.V aircraft were used for various experimental duties, including: innovative structure, performance, stability and control of flying wing aircraft. The first H.V was the first aircraft to be built using an all composite material structure. Design and development Reimar Horten developed a relationship with Dynamit AG, at Troisdorf, the major producer of phenolic resins in Germany. There he learnt of the various products available and how to use them in aircraft structures. After having built two Hols der Teufel wings from 'Dynal', a plastic composite material made from paper reinforced phenolic resin and incorporated other plastic materials in the Horten H.II, the Horten brothers took the next step and designed an aircraft to be built completely of Dynal, (with the exception of undercarriage, engine mounts, high strength fittings and cockpit framing). Structural components were moulded and assembled using glue and bolts through holes drilled in the components without bushings. Leading edge D-boxes were built up using sheets of Dynal glued either side of a 'Tronal' (wall board) core, cold pressed in moulds. The first H.V (later re-dubbed H.Va after two further aircraft were built) was powered by two Hirth HM 60R engines driving specially carved pusher propellers directly, without gearboxes or extension shafts. Pilot and passenger lay semi-prone in the nose under extensive plastic sheet glazing. The undercarriage of the H.V was fixed, with a nosewheel just aft of the cockpit and two mainwheels under the engines, the fairings of which formed the only fin area to impart directional stability. One more aircraft was built, using conventional wooden materials: the H.Vb, which had two upright seats under individual canopies either side of the centre-section. After being abandoned to the elements the H.Vb was converted to the sole H.Vc with a single upright seat under a sideways opening canopy. The H.Vc was allocated the RLM ID number 8-252 (later re-used for the 1938-39 Junkers trimotor replacement for the Ju 52/3m) and by inference Horten Ho 252 though this was little used in practice. Operational history The H.V(a) had a very brief career crashing on take-off for its first flight, after the nose rose alarmingly without enough control power to lower it. Walter, the pilot shut one engine down and closed the throttle on the other, with difficulty but was unable to prevent the aircraft sinking to the ground in a flat attitude at high rate of descent. The H.Vb enjoyed a successful career but was eventually abandoned to the elements when the brothers had pressing wartime commitments. This aircraft was rebuilt as the H.Vc, flying in 1942. Eventually the H.Vc succumbed to a crash in 1943 after the pilot attempted a take-off with full landing flap selected, hit a hangar and dropped to the ground.

He was the first black professor at the University of the Witwatersrand, and was the first black person to be awarded honorary membership to the Actuarial Society of South Africa. He was awarded the Order of the Baobab in 2002 for his services to mathematics education.  Early life and education  Kambule was born in Aliwal North. His mother died when he was 18 months old, and his aunt was responsible for raising him. He did not attend school until he was 11 years old, when he joined Anglican St Peter's School in Johannesburg. He completed a Teachers Diploma at Adams College in 1946 and a Bachelor's degree at the University of South Africa in 1954.  Career  Kambule taught in Zambia, Malawi as well as several schools in South Africa before being appointed Principal of Orlando High School in Soweto in 1958. He campaigned to ensure the children had the best education possible, despite the restrictions of the Bantu Education Act, 1953. Orlando High School had a library named after Robert Birley, a visiting professor at the University of the Witwatersrand. He led the Rand Bursary Fund, a support program that provided scholarships for pupils in need. The fund allowed more than 1,000 students to complete high school. His former pupils included Desmond Tutu and Jackie Selebi. In 1976 during the Soweto uprising, the schoolchildren revolted against being forced to learn in the Afrikaans language. An undetermined number of children were shot dead by police, and education in townships fell apart. Kambule resigned in 1977 to protest against the Department of Bantu Education, and became the head of Pace College. In 1978 he joined the University of the Witwatersrand, where he became the first black professor. He published a series of maths textbooks for non-specialist teachers. He retired in 1976 and promptly became the Principal of O R T Step College of Technology. He was awarded an honorary doctorate in 1997 and a doctorate of education in 2006. In 2002 he was awarded the Order of the Baobab from Thabo Mbeki. He became known as the Rock for his transparent principles. Kambule died on 7 August 2009. He was a much loved teacher, and his former students Siphiwe Nyanda, Felicia Mabuza-Suttle and Mokotedi Mpshe attended his memorial service. His student Trevor Mdaka was his doctor at the Unitas Hospital in Centurion. = Legacy = In 2017 the University of the Witwatersrand named their Mathematical Sciences Building after him.

It consists of a cape extending into the Persian Gulf. Large concentrations of mangroves (Avicennia marina) are located off its coast. It is located to the northeast of Al Khor City and to the southeast of Al Thakhira. Etymology \\"Ras\\" in Arabic means \\"head\\", in this context it is being used to refer to a headland. On the other hand, \\"matbakh\\" is translated as \\"kitchen\\". This name was given because the area was used a massive fireplace in the past for cooking. History Al Khor produced in 1823. In the 1820s, George Barnes Brucks carried out the first British survey of the Persian Gulf. He recorded the following notes about Ras Matbakh: \\"Ras Mut Buck is an elevated cape, in lat. 25¬∞ 40' N., long. 51¬∞ 36' 15' E. This cape should not be approached under four or five fathoms.\\" A survey conducted by the British Hydrographic Office in 1890 describes the area in significantly more detail: Infrastructure Construction of a Qatari Coast Guard station was initiated in 2014. As part of the project, two administrative structures, two supporting structures and a road were built, resulting in a developed area of 3,156 m¬≤ occupying a total area of 16,995 m¬≤. Ashghal (The Public Works Authority) announced the completion of the 101,000 square meter facility of the Aquatic Fisheries and Research Centre in Ras Matbakh in 2017. The total cost of the project was QR 237.7 million. Archaeology During the first large-scale archaeological expedition of Qatar in the 20th century, the Danish Mission, active from 1956 to 1964, made discoveries at Ras Matbakh. The area was first introduced to archaeologists Hans J√∏rgen Madsen and Jens Aarup Jensen in November 1961 by Ahmed bin Jassim Al Thani, then-ruler of Al Khor. Arriving on 22 November, the two Danish archaeologists surveyed and wrote a report of the site on 23 November. They unearthed a green pot near the coastline containing long-decomposed human remains, likely those of an adult, as well as some animal bones. The Danes estimated that the pot could originate from 500‚Äì300 BC and stated it resembled the burial tradition and pottery design found in ancient Bahrain and Mesopotamia at that time. Thus, they postulated that it may have been a burial for a Bahraini or Mesopotamian sailor who died near the site.

He started his criminal career in a local Texan gang before joining the Gulf Cartel, where he worked as a regional leader in an area known as La Ribere√±a, across the border from Starr County, Texas. Though born in the U.S., Pe√±a worked in Mexico and maintained close ties with Texas. Known for his charisma and heavily tattooed body, Pe√±a was viewed as a gangster folk hero on both sides of the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border. In 2013, he was betrayed and killed by an alleged member of the Gulf Cartel. Several people paid tribute to him online by creating a Facebook page and uploading photos and rap music videos in his memory. Early life and career Mario Alberto Pe√±a, known as \\"Popo\\" or \\"Comandante Popo\\" (English: \\"Commander Popo\\"), was born in Rio Grande City, Texas, United States, on 22 October 1980. He grew up in Roma, Texas, and started his criminal career for a local Texan street gang. He eventually joined the Gulf Cartel, a criminal group based in Tamaulipas, Mexico. In the Gulf Cartel, Pe√±a was a regional leader in an area in Tamaulipas known as La Ribere√±a, which sits across Starr County, Texas. Though born in the U.S., Pe√±a operated primarily in Mexico and maintained ties with the Rio Grande Valley. On 16 August 2011, Pe√±a and an accomplice, Daniel Baz√°n, committed a drive-by shooting at a residence in Alto Bonito Heights, Texas. According to eye-witnesses, both men arrived at a property in a vehicle and shot at the place using AR-15 assault rifles and other pistols. The Starr County Sheriff's Office issued a bulletin asking the public to reach out with any information about Pe√±a's whereabouts. The wanted flyer said Pe√±a was approximately and weighed . He was described as having brown eyes and hair, a beard and mustache, and tattoos in multiple parts of his body. Deputy Erasmo Rios said they believed Pe√±a was hiding in the Starr County area, but recommended civilians not try to apprehend either him or his accomplice because they were considered armed and dangerous. The warrant against both men was for attempted capital murder. Pe√±a fled to Mexico shortly after he was charged. Death and legacy Pe√±a was killed in Comales, a rural community near Camargo, Tamaulipas, on 19 March 2013. According to security forces, Pe√±a was killed as part of an internal strife incident within the Gulf Cartel that dated back to September 2011, when suspected Gulf Cartel leader Samuel Flores Borrego (alias \\"Metro 3\\") was killed by members of his own criminal group. Pe√±a was confirmed dead by U.S. federal authorities, when his body was taken to the international crossing by his family members. Mexican authorities also confirmed his death. According to Pe√±a's sister, the family was able to recover the body with the help of another Gulf Cartel regional leader, Juan Francisco S√°enz T√°mez, alias \\"Comandante Panochitas\\" (English: \\"Commander Pussy\\"). Pe√±a was buried in a private ceremony in Texas. His family told the McAllen-based newspaper The Monitor in an interview that Pe√±a died \\"with honor\\". When Pe√±a was alive, he was regarded as a charismatic gangster and folk hero on both sides of the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border. Since his death, several have paid tribute to him online by creating a Facebook page and uploading photos and multiple rap music videos about him. This furthered Pe√±a's image as some sort of gangster folk hero. Two of the music videos online tell the story of how Pe√±a was killed, and claim that he was betrayed by a former ally. Pe√±a's sister claims that his murderer was suspected Gulf Cartel regional leader known as Eduardo Luna, who shot Pe√±a from behind because he was guarding US$2 million in cash for the Gulf Cartel. She claimed that after he killed Pe√±a, Luna fled to the U.S., where he was later arrested for another murder and corruption case involving the United States Border Patrol. Pe√±a's sister also claims that she had met Luna in Mexico, and that he killed several others before her brother. She said his alias in the Gulf Cartel was \\"Comandante P√°jaro\\" (English: \\"Commander Bird\\"). Her claims were not independently verified by law enforcement, and she later declined an interview with The Texas Tribune. Luna's defense did not comment on Pe√±a's case.

Briana Ojeda was an 11-year-old girl from Brooklyn, New York, who died in the summer of 2010 when police officer Alfonso Mendez did not perform CPR on her after she suffered from an asthma attack. Prior to the passage of the law, the New York Police Department trained its officers in CPR, but they were not obligated by law to perform it. Briana's Law requires that every police officer, member of the State Police, including police officer trainees and state police cadets, receive CPR training prior to employment as well as during employment every two years, where practicable, but no later than 4 years, and requires that individuals demonstrate proficiency in the technique.Cuomo signs ‚ÄòBriana‚Äôs Law‚Äô requiring all cops to get CPR training, be recertified every 2 years Briana's Law: A Victory for the State of New York Senate Bill S3165B SIGNED BY GOVERNOR 2017-2018 Legislative Session Briana Ojeda Briana Amaryllis Ojeda was a young girl of Puerto Rican descent born in 1998 in Brooklyn, New York, to Michael Angelo and Carmen Ojeda.Assembly Passes Legislation Establishing \\"Briana's Law\\" Ojeda was raised there and received her primary education in the Boerum Hill Historic District section of that borough. She was about to enter the sixth grade at St. Francis Xavier School. when on August 27, 2010, she suffered an asthma attack while playing in a Carroll Gardens playground. Her mother, Carmen, panicked when she realized that the asthma attack was severe. She rushed to take her daughter to the Long Island College Hospital which was the closest hospital to them in Brooklyn. While driving her car, she mistakenly made a wrong turn on a one way street . Brooklyn Girl Who Died From Asthma Attack Laid To Rest, September 1, 2010 Officer Alfonso Mendez, a five-year veteran in the New York Police Department, spotted Mrs. Ojeda's car going in the wrong direction. He told her to pull over and to stop her car. Mrs. Ojeda did as she was told and told the police officer that her daughter was not breathing and needed CPR immediately. According to the testimony of witness Eria Domenech: The New York Police Department does train its officers in CPR, but they were not obligated by law to perform it. Officer Mendez later testified in a deposition that the only training in CPR that he received was that out of a textbook and that he had never practiced it on anyone. Officer Mendez proceeded to give Mrs. Ojeda a ticket which delayed her from continuing on to the hospital. Finally, he allowed Mrs. Ojeda to continue driving to the Long Island College Hospital; however, instead of calling 9-1-1 for help and leading Mrs. Ojedas' car to the hospital with his squad-car, thereby allowing her to pass through the heavy traffic, he followed her with his car.Brooklyn, NY - NYPD Cop Identified, Suspended for Failing to Help Girl Dying of Asthma When they finally arrived at the hospital emergency room, it was too late. Ojeda was pronounced dead about an hour later.Briana Ojeda Remembered as an Angel at Funeral, Channel 4 News Briana Ojeda's funeral was held at St. Francis Xavier Church, the Park Slope church. Her casket was carried along 6th Avenue and placed on a horse- drawn carriage. The carriage then took the casket to the cemetery where she was buried. The event was covered by the news media, including CBS 2's Pablo Guzman. Briana was survived by her parents Michael Angelo and Carmen Ojeda, her brother Michael Angelo Jr. and by her grandmother Maria. Search for Officer Mendez According to the New York Daily News, Police Commissioner Raymond \\"Ray\\" Kelly told reporters at a press briefing that not enough information is known to determine whether the person being blamed in the death of Briana Ojeda was in fact an NYPD officer. Kelly also said that the NYPD's Internal Affairs Bureau was expanding its search to neighboring commands. He speculated the mystery officer could have been a police officer from outside of the 76th Precinct visiting a courthouse in nearby downtown Brooklyn. The commissioner said it's also possible the officer could have been an NYPD traffic agent, auxiliary cop or even someone from a different law enforcement agency or a private security company.NYPD hunts mystery 'cop' who failed to help Briana Ojeda, Brooklyn girl dying of asthma Officer Mendez, who was assigned to the 84th Precinct in downtown Brooklyn, failed to turn himself in. The NYPD's Internal Affairs at the time spent several days trying to identify the officer who allegedly failed to help Mrs. Ojeda. Police Commissioner Ray Kelly was upset because it took four days to locate Officer Mendez. After Mendez turned himself in, he was suspended without pay for thirty days by the NYPD. The reason behind the suspension was that he failed to report his involvement in the incident. However, no criminal charges were filed against him.Asthma girl parents sue city, cop in 11-year-old‚Äôs death Lawsuit In November, the Ojeda family hired attorney Bonita Zelman and sued the city and Officer Mendez. The family was demanding $10 million to compensate for the loss of their daughter. In addition they also sued the city and Mendez for $7 million for their alleged negligence. According to attorney Zelman, \\"The city failed to properly train and supervise Mendez\\". An investigation by the NYPD reported that Officer Mendez had confronted Mrs. Ojeda, after she allegedly had sideswiped a car near Kane and Henry streets while driving the wrong way down a one-way street in a mad dash to get her choking daughter to Long Island College Hospital on Hicks Street. After the mother told Mendez about the situation with her daughter, he claimed that he didn't know CPR ‚Äì even though all NYPD officers are trained in the life-saving technique at the Police Academy. Then Officer Mendez proceeded to give Mrs. Ojeda a ticket for the car accident as her daughter gasped for air. Supreme Court dismisses the lawsuit In July 2016, the case regarding the lawsuit was presented before Kings County Supreme Court Justice Dawn M. Jimenez-Salta, a Brooklyn judge.Exclusive: NYPD isn‚Äôt to blame for 2010 death of Brooklyn girl because cops didn't have to know CPR to save her from asthma attack According to the New York Daily News, Officer Mendez had testified in a deposition that he had only received CPR training out of a textbook and had never practiced on a dummy. \\"I didn't feel safe putting my hands on someone without actually knowing what I'm doing,\\" Mendez testified. Neither Mrs. Ojeda nor the witnesses of the incident where asked to testify. After hearing the arguments from the accused, the judge dismissed the lawsuit in favor of the city and Officer Mendez. According to Judge Jimenez-Salta, her decision in regard to Officer Mendez was based on the fact that the Police Department does not require officers \\"to know and be willing and able\\" to perform the life-saving resuscitation. An exception would be if the person in need of aid is under arrest. The judge also dismissed the claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress because she did not find Mendez's failure to perform CPR \\"extreme and outrageous\\" due to his lack of knowledge. Lawyers for the city moved to dismiss the wrongful death suit, arguing that there is no constitutional or state right to the government providing emergency medical assistance. Therefore, the judge decided that the brief traffic stop \\"did not trigger a constitutional duty to provide medical assistance.\\" Mrs. Ojeda later said that she had felt a sense of relief when she first encountered Officer Mendez, believing that he would help her by applying CPR to her daughter. She also stated that police officers should be made to help a person because they are the first ones on the scene. New York Senate Bill S3165B (Briana's Law) The Ojedas were frustrated with the judge's decision and hired a new lawyer, Jason Leventhal, to review the decision. However, the decision prevailed, and the Ojedas then took it upon themselves to promote the establishment of a law which would require every NYPD officer to get CPR training. Every year the Ojeda family would travel to Albany, New York, and fight for a mandatory CPR law before the New York State Senate. In 2013, New York Assemblyman Felix Ortiz introduced a bill called \\"Briana's Law\\". It passed the Assembly but did not get voted on in the Senate. New York State Senators Velmanette Montgomery, who is steering the bill through the Senate and Jesse Hamilton introduced the bill known as Bill S3165B to the State Senate and on January 20, 2017, it was passed by the Senate legislature with the sponsorship and the backing of Assembly Assistant Speaker Felix W. Ortiz, Councilman Stephen Levin and the American Red Cross Metro N.Y. North and American Heart Association of New York City. On August 27, 2017, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed \\"Briana's Law\\" requiring all police officers to get CPR training and be re-certified every 2 years. The following is a copy of the law signed by the governor: New York State Senator Jesse Hamilton made the following statement after the Governor signed the Bill converting it into Briana's Law: Tributes to Briana The Ojeda family opened Angel's Gourmet Deli & Nuna's Juice Bar in Brooklyn in remembrance of their daughter, Briana Ojeda.

She is best known for originating the idea for the historical outdoor drama, Texas, and facilitating both its creation and the Pioneer Amphitheater where it is performed in Palo Duro Canyon.  Biography  Harper was born in St. Paul, Minnesota on July 22, 1911. Her father, Rollin Pease, was a singer who was involved in historical pageants. Harper was raised in Evanston, Illinois. From 1931 to 1951, her father worked as a professor of music at the University of Arizona (UA). Harper earned her bachelor's degree from UA and then studied at the American Conservatory in Chicago while also earning her master's degree from the University of Chicago. While Harper was in college and for some time after, she traveled with her father and worked as his accompanist. After graduation, she taught in the Tucson public schools. She was married to Ples Harper on June 1, 1939 and the couple moved to Peru where Ples worked as a cultural- exchange director for the United States. They stayed in Peru for about five years and during this time, Harper worked as a director for girls in Callao. When Ples took a job at West Texas State Teachers College (now West Texas A&M; University) in 1946, the couple settled in Canyon, Texas. There she worked as a piano teacher at Canyon High School. Harper also wrote a book, Meet Some Musical Terms: A First Dictionary in 1959. In July 1960, Harper was inspired to create an outdoor musical using the Palo Duro Canyon as the place for the performance. She founded an organization in 1961, the Texas Panhandle Heritage Foundation Incorporated, which eventually built the Pioneer Amphitheater located in Palo Duro Canyon. and Harper contacted playwright, Paul Green, to see if he would be interested in writing a symphonic drama about the Texas Panhandle. Green wrote a historical drama, Texas, which opened on July 1, 1966. The drama went on to be a success, drawing large numbers of people to the canyon and becoming the best-attended outdoor history drama in the United States according to the Texas Observer. Harper was honored with the creation of a bronze bust in her likeness, sculpted by Jack King Hill, that was installed in the Pioneer Amphitheater in 1980. She was inducted into the Cowgirl Hall of Fame in 1981. In 1988, she was inducted into the Texas Women's Hall of Fame. Harper died in a hospital in Amarillo on November 16, 1991. She is buried in Dreamland Cemetery in Canyon.

First generation An estimated 3 million pregnant women in the USA were prescribed DES from 1941 through 1971. DES was also widely prescribed to women in Canada, the UK, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand during a similar period. Women who were prescribed DES during pregnancy have been shown to have a modestly increased risk of breast cancer and breast cancer mortality. Second generation =DES daughters= DES gained notoriety when it was shown to cause a rare vaginal tumor in girls and young women who had been exposed to this drug in utero. In 1971, the New England Journal of Medicine published a report showing that seven of eight girls and young women (ages 14 to 22) who had been diagnosed with vaginal clear cell adenocarcinoma had been exposed prenatally to DES. Subsequent studies have shown an approximate 40-fold increased risk of vaginal/cervical clear cell adenocarcinoma in women exposed in utero to DES. As a consequence of this evidence, DES is considered an established human carcinogen. DES was one of the first transplacental carcinogens discovered in humans, meaning a toxin could cross the placenta and harm the fetus. It had originally been believed that the placenta protected the developing fetus but it is now known that is not true. Daughters exposed to DES in utero may also have an increased risk of moderate to severe cervical squamous cell dysplasia and an increased risk of breast cancer. In addition to its carcinogenic properties, DES is a known teratogen, an agent capable of causing malformations in daughters and sons who were exposed in utero. DES-exposed daughters are at an increased risk of abnormalities of the reproductive tract, including vaginal epithelial changes such as vaginal adenosis (which means a type of cell normally found in the uterus, columnar cells, are also present in the vagina), an increased cervical transformation zone, and uterine abnormalities, such as T-shaped uterus. These anomalies contribute to an increased risk of infertility and adverse pregnancy outcomes in prenatally DES-exposed daughters. The most recent published research on DES daughters' adverse health outcomes documented by the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) appears in the October 6, 2011 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine under the authorship of RN Hoover et al., and lists these adverse effects and risk factors: Cumulative risks in women exposed to DES, as compared with those not exposed, were as follows: for infertility, 33.3% vs. 15.5%; spontaneous abortion, 50.3% vs. 38.6%; preterm delivery, 53.3% vs. 17.8%; loss of second-trimester pregnancy, 16.4% vs. 1.7%; ectopic pregnancy, 14.6% vs. 2.9%; preeclampsia, 26.4% vs. 13.7%; stillbirth, 8.9% vs. 2.6%; early menopause, 5.1% vs. 1.7%; grade 2 or higher cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, 6.9% vs. 3.4%; and breast cancer at 40 years of age or older, 3.9% vs. 2.2%. Daughters with prenatal exposure to DES may also have an increased risk of uterine fibroids, and incompetent cervix in adulthood. Studies of DES daughters have not found a link between in utero exposure to DES and autoimmune diseases. In an animal model designed to study environmental estrogens, DES turned out to be an obesogen capable of causing adult weight gain in female mice which had been exposed to DES during neonatal development. The excess weight gain was not apparent at birth or in infancy, but occurred in adulthood. =DES sons= Initially, fewer studies documented risks of prenatal exposure to DES on males (referred to as \\"DES sons\\"). In the 1970s and early 1980s, studies published on prenatally DES-exposed males investigated increased risk of testicular cancer, infertility and urogenital abnormalities in development, such as cryptorchidism and hypospadias. Research published in the U.S. by Palmer et al. in 2009 further confirmed evidence of these findings. Additional research published in Finland in 2012 has further confirmed an increased risk of cryptorchidism among males exposed prenatally to DES. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has acknowledged the link between DES exposure and noncancerous epididymal cysts. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) has documented that prenatal DES exposure in males is positively linked to a condition known as hypogonadism (low testosterone levels) that may require treatment with testosterone replacement therapy. =Sexual differentiation= Research investigating the possible behavioral and psychosexual effects of prenatal DES exposure in human males occurred as early as 1973. This research has centered on a long-standing question of whether prenatal exposure to DES in offspring of mothers who were prescribed DES may have included sexual orientation and gender-related behavioral effects and physical intersex conditions. Kaplan published the first-known medical study (1959) of intersex condition in a male prenatally-exposed to DES. There is some evidence linking prenatal hormonal influences on sexual orientation, gender identity and transgender development, but this is an area of behavioral research that remains controversial. Several published studies in the medical literature have examined the hypothesis that prenatal exposure to estrogens (including DES) may cause significant developmental impact on sexual differentiation of the brain, and on subsequent behavioral and gender identity development in exposed males and females. One of the leading investigators of this area of research is June Reinisch, former director of the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction. Reinisch cited several cases of \\"male feminization\\" among prenatally DES-exposed males. An Internet survey reported a high rate of transgender and intersex identity in people assigned male at birth participating in an online support forum for DES sons. Of 500 respondents, about 32% identified as transgender, transsexual, gender dysphoric, or intersex (90, 48, 17, and 3, respectively). The first real study on transgender identity in people assigned male at birth who were prenatally exposed to DES was published in 2020 and found a very low incidence of transgenderism (2 in about 930 or around 0.2%). It wasn't possible to determine whether the incidence was higher than in controls due to the small number of cases, but the findings did indicate in any case that the influence of prenatal DES exposure on likelihood of being transgender would be only small at most. =DES Daughters and Sons study= A study conducted by the US National Cancer Institute, which assessed about 5,600 women and 2,600 men who had documented prenatal exposure to DES, called \\"DES Daughters\\" and \\"DES Sons\\", respectively, found that \\"DES Daughters were just as likely as unexposed women to be left-handed. DES Sons were slightly more likely to be left-handed than unexposed men (14% vs. 11%, respectively). The researchers found no association between DES exposure and reported mental illness in DES Daughters, although the authors cautioned that this aspect may be under- represented due to the nature of self-reported data. In addition, no association was found between DES exposure and anorexia or bulimia.\\" Psychological anomalies Most of the initial research documenting the psychological effects of prenatal DES exposure was poorly conducted, often by mail card. Despite that, some more carefully conducted studies show a clear link to depression, and a more recent French study asserts that there was an 83% increase in psychological disorders for offspring that were prenatally exposed to DES. Third generation Current research also looks at DES in the third generation. These are the grandchildren of women who were given DES during pregnancy and whose mother or father was therefore exposed to DES in utero. Studies of the third generation are important because DES might be associated with epigenetic changes, which involve changes to the way genes behave (not involving the DNA itself) that may be heritable from one generation to another. If epigenetic changes occur and are heritable, studies of the DES-exposed third generation have implications for the influence of environmental endocrine disruptors on human health and evolution. Recent studies from the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) show that the daughters of women who were exposed in utero to DES may be less likely than the unexposed to have regular menstrual periods. A possible increased risk of infertility in the older, third generation daughters was also noted. The NCI study provides limited evidence of an increased risk of birth defects in the sons or daughters of women who were exposed prenatally to DES. An increased risk of ovarian cancer in the daughters of women exposed in utero was observed, but it was based on three cases of almost 800, so the finding is considered preliminary and requires further study. Some evidence suggests the sons of prenatally DES-exposed women might have an increased risk of hypospadias, but other studies suggest the increase in risk might not be as great as once thought.

As a result, many major cities across the United States have at least one Jewish country club and, in cities with larger Jewish populations, often more than one, founded by wealthy Jews in that era. Although Jews, along with other ethnic and religious minorities, continue to be excluded from some country clubs, informal policies excluding Jews began to wane starting in the 1960s. By the 1990s, and in the wake of the 1990 PGA Championship, even more clubs opened up their membership to Jews, African Americans, and others. With more options for wealthy Jews, many Jewish country clubs saw declining membership and failed; others lost their Jewish character and developed a more diverse membership base. Nevertheless, many Jewish country clubs retain their identity and still exist in major cities across the U.S; however, in the Philadelphia area, for example, all but one of the existing clubs no longer affiliate with the Jewish Federation, once seen as an important piece of their Jewish identity by raising funds for charity. Origins Many country clubs in the United States were established around the same time that immigration to the country, including of Jews, began to rise sharply. As anti-Semitism increased, Jews - even Jews who once had access to elite WASP social societies \\\\- were blackballed from joining clubs. By the early 20th century, most cities with meaningful Jewish populations had formed country clubs, and by 1928, there were 34 Jewish social and country clubs in the greater New York area, though many Jews still saw the inability to join non-Jewish social organizations as an impediment to assimilating and Americanizing. Despite having been born of discrimination, Jewish country clubs often discriminated within the Jewish population. In the early years of the 20th century, membership at some clubs was restricted to German Jews, though as populations grew and intermarried, Russian and Polish Jews were also accepted. According to a 1962 Anti- Defamation League survey of 803 country clubs, 224 were found to be non- discriminatory, while among the predominantly Christian clubs, 89 had quotas on the number of Jewish members and 416 admitted no Jews, though the Jewish Telegraphic Agency noted that social club discrimination was \\"in retreat\\" by the mid-1960s. Nevertheless, some country clubs still admit few or no Jews. Although Jewish country clubs have predominantly Jewish memberships, the clubs themselves are not particularly Jewish in terms of custom or practice‚Äîclubs tend to be open on Shabbat and serve non-Kosher food. The names and architecture of clubs are not recognizably Jewish and often mimicked the convention of the other, predominantly Protestant country club from which Jews were excluded. Decline Starting in the 1960s, more Jews were accepted into predominantly Christian country clubs, though change often came slowly until the 1990 PGA Championship, which called attention to discrimination in clubs and social organizations across the United States. Clubs were forced either to admit more African American and Jewish members or to lose future PGA tournaments; some opted to integrate, while others retained restrictions on blacks and Jews. In 1990 Tom Watson famously resigned from the Kansas City Country Club over its refusal to admit billionaire H&R; Block founder Henry Bloch. That freedom to assimilate has hurt Jewish country clubs. Between intermarriage, more geographically dispersed Jewish populations, fewer golfers, and a decline in country club membership generally, many Jewish country clubs have either had to fold, merge, or lose their Jewish identity. In cities with multiple Jewish country clubs, there is increasing consolidation. Three of the six Jewish country clubs in Baltimore closed between 1985 and 2010, for example. Many clubs remain vibrant, however, particularly in areas with large Jewish populations or where other Jewish clubs have folded or no longer have predominantly Jewish membership. In addition to demographic changes, the Madoff investment scandal hit Jewish country clubs particularly hard. Bernie Madoff was an avid golfer in both New York and Florida, and many members of Jewish country clubs had invested heavily in his Ponzi scheme. When Woodmont Country Club, a Jewish country club in the Washington, D.C. area, promised membership to President Barack Obama after the end of his presidency, some of its members objected because of his actions towards Israel. The club ultimately admitted him.

organ, also called an octophone (unrelated to the mandola-related octophone), was an instrument invented by the French chemist Septimus Piesse, in which the keys of a piano activated one of 46 different odors. In 1857, in his book The Art of Perfumery, Piesse used music to describe how notes and smells can work together: \\"There is, as it were, an octave of odors like an octave in music; certain odors coincide, like the keys of an instrument.\\"G. W. Septimus Piesse, The Art of Perfumery And Methods of Obtaining the Odors of Plants Philadelphia: Lindsay and Blakiston, 1857; Ebook: Project Gutenberg, July 28, 2005, [EBook #16378]. As Sadakichi Hartmann noted in 1913, the keys of the octophone \\"are complementary and can be combined to harmonies as sounds to a musical chord. It is a valuable guide on a quasi scientific basis for the manufacturers of perfumery, for it is only necessary to strike a chord on the piano, and to know what odors the respective notes of the chord represent, to arrive at the suggestion for some new bouquet.\\" Hartmann was skeptical of the value of the perfume organ for \\"aesthetical\\" experiments, as \\"the affinity between sounds and odors is purely speculative\\". In 1922, the magazine Science and Invention had an article on a new, silent take on the perfume organ. Instead of attempting harmony of music and scent, the keys on the keyboard of the Science and Invention version played only notes of perfume. There does not appear to be any evidence that this particular smell organ was ever constructed.

It is now considered to be a lost film. It was shot at the Tempelhof Studios in Berlin. Plot As described in a film magazine, Iola (Negri), a beautiful woman of the Latin Quarter, marries a rich cattle owner Pedro Maurez (von Ledebur) from South America to live in peace and happiness. The arrival of young Parisian Paul Durand (Liedtke) wets her interest again in the old haunts of Paris. When her husband is slain in an uprising of laborers, she is again thrown on her own resources. She travels to Paris with the young businessman and, upon their arrival, she is sheltered by the youth's father Henri (Patry). Here she meets her former husband Jules Lambert (Sch√ºnzel) who is secretary to Henri. The former husband, by his wife Iola's extravagance, had been led to defaulting trust funds. Her host and son both fall in love with her and her former husband stands like a Nemesis in the background. On the night of a carnival, where Iola is made queen of the festivities, the secretary confesses his past to Paul, telling of his imprisonment for larceny and his efforts to live down his past. Paul steps up to box at the carnival and sees his father embrace Iola. So horrified is the young man at the sight and of his own unrequited love that he kills himself almost at the feet of the couple. But Iola is feted and showered with flowers until the grim tragedy drives her from the ball room and into the night. She is confused and falls before a train, making her last payment.

The station was opened in 1892 and was initially a through station on the line from (the later location of) Kuala Lumpur railway station to Ampang. The track from Kuala Lumpur ran through the middle of Foch Avenue (currently Jalan Tun Tan Cheng Lock), but this section was closed after some time. Now a terminus, Sultan Street station remained accessible from the main line via a junction at what is now Salak Selatan Komuter station. A new station building was constructed for the terminus station. The station's closure date is unknown, but it is still shown on the 1962 official Malayan topographical survey map. Moreover, the station was noted as having a diesel railcar service to Seremban railway station, which was affected by a railway strike in December 1962. Multiple services per day to Ampang were still running in 1965, when another strike disrupted them. On 6 June 1967, the station was the scene of protests which were dispersed by police. In 1969, the station was still open, as it was reported train tickets could be bought here for KTM services.

History The Renaissance style palace was built between 1610 and 1614 by the Riminese lawyer, Alessandro Gambalunga. Upon his death in 1619, he bequeathed his book collection and 17th-century palace to the city. Additional donations, and the addition of collections from suppressed religious organizations have increased its holdings. Initially the historical library moved to the ground floor, around the loggias of the inner courtyard. It has now moved to the piano nobile, and sheltered on 17th-century walnut shelves. The collection holds 226,000 books, including 60,000 rare books (among which are 380 incunabula and nearly 5,000 16th-century editions), 1,350 codices, 6,000 prints, ca. 2,400 periodicals (330 current serials), music scores, cd- roms, audiocassettes, and films. An 11th-century Evangelarium and an early 12th-century codex of Honorius Augustodunensis and a codex by Hugh of Saint Victor are examples of the Beneventan script. The collection includes the letters to and from Giovanni Bianchi; including correspondence with Voltaire, Spallanzani, Haller, and Monti.

Its 2016 circulation was 1,710.  History  The Statesman began its life as the Grafton Sentinel, a publication that was only weeks old when editor and publisher James W. Holt took it over in 1870. Holt, a 21 year old who had previously worked at the Preston County Journal, went through a series of partners but, aside from a short period of divestment from the paper in 1875, remained editor and publisher of the paper until 1893, and returned to the management of the paper after a short tenure as the county's postmaster. As a staunchly Republican paper in a majority Democratic county, Holt's publication found surprising success. In 1903 Holt introduced the Daily Sentinel, an eight-page six column evening paper, to serve the growing city of Grafton. Holt continued as publisher and editor until three years before his death, handing control of the paper to his son Howard H. Holt in 1915. The younger son in turn passed it to his son, James F. Holt, on his death in 1936. James left the paper in 1948, selling it to Joseph Abey, a Pennsylvania publisher, after deciding to embark on a career in law. In 1946, at the age of just 20, Eldora Nuzum became editor of the Sentinel. At the time of her death, multiple local sources identified her as the first female editor of a daily newspaper in West Virginia. In the 1960s, the paper (and one of its reporters) were known for the Grafton Monster sighting. In 1975 the Sentinel ceased its daily publication schedule, changed its name to the Mountain Statesman, and moved to the three times a week schedule it uses today. It is owned by News Media Corporation, which bought the paper in the early 1970s.

It's located at the highest part of Cache Glacier, on the shared boundary of Skagit County and Chelan County in Washington state. Cache Col is situated south of Cascade Pass on the shared border of North Cascades National Park and Glacier Peak Wilderness. Cache Col and the Cache Glacier are at the northern end of the Ptarmigan Traverse which is mountaineering route that provides access to remote peaks such as Mount Formidable and Dome Peak. Precipitation runoff on the north side of the col drains into the Stehekin River, while precipitation drains into the Cascade River from the south side. Climate Cache Col is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Cache Glacier with Cache Col in upper left, circa 1900 Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite spires. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

A hostage situation then arose inside of the store. Police were involved by 4:00 pm, and there were reports that the gunman opened fire. A woman was killed during the standoff, as 28-year-old Atkins was arrested. Atkins's 78-year-old grandmother, Mary Elizabeth Madison, was shot seven times and was reported to be in critical condition. Another female hostage, the perpetrator's girlfriend, was grazed by a bullet. Trader Joe's store employee Melyda Corado was shot and killed by a police bullet as the perpetrator exchanged fire with police. Incident The shootings began on the evening of July 20, when Atkins' cousin spotted Atkins sleeping in his grandmother's home on 32nd Street near Long Beach Avenue with a gun under his pillow. According to Atkins' cousin, Charlene Egland, Atkins, who had lived with his grandmother since he was a young child, had been quarreling with his grandmother over his live-in girlfriend. The grandmother did not want her living in the home. Atkins shot his grandmother and his girlfriend around 1:30 pm on July 21, then forced his girlfriend, who was bleeding from the gunshot wound, into his grandmother's car and drove off. Several people reported the incident and LAPD was dispatched. A police helicopter traced his car to the Hollywood area and responding officers gave chase for nearly fifteen minutes. He then crashed his grandmother's Toyota into a power pole in Silver Lake in front of the Trader Joe's supermarket on Hyperion Avenue at 3:30 pm. Atkins emerged from the vehicle holding a handgun and fired at the police. According to witnesses at the scene, Atkins fired at police officers at least twice. There were between 40 and 50 people inside the grocery store. Atkins emerged from his crashed car and fired at the police who were pursuing him as he ran towards the store. An officer shot and killed Corado during the standoff, according to LAPD police chief Michel Moore. Atkins held hostages inside the store for about three hours as police officers in tactical gear standing outside the store used mirrors to watch as hostage negotiators persuaded Atkins to release the hostages and surrender. Around 6:30 pm, he agreed to handcuff himself, and was led from the building accompanied by four hostages to ensure that he would not be shot. He was then taken into custody. Suspect The suspect was identified as Gene Evin Atkins, a 28-year-old African-American male. He had lived with his grandmother since he was seven years old. According to his cousin, Atkins had recently lost his job and two cars. Atkins had previously slashed the tires on his grandmother's car and broke the windows in the house. The cousin described him as having a history of mental health problems and as a quiet man who was despondent about his future. She quoted him as having said, \\"The next thing I do, I'm going to die doing it or I'm going to jail.\\" He opened fire on the police, but no officers were reported injured. The gunman was arrested, charged with murder, and was initially held on $2 million bail. Legal proceedings Atkins was charged in August with 51 crimes, including murder, two counts of attempted murder, four counts of attempted murder of a police officer, and several counts of false imprisonment of hostages. Bail was increased from $18.7 million to $23 million. Aftermath The police officers have received criticism for inadvertently killing Corado with gunfire despite warnings from one officer who said to his partner, \\"Do not, do not shoot. We are going to keep our distance.\\" Jill Leovy, a former police reporter for the Los Angeles Times, criticized the LAPD, saying, \\"This is about training and tactics and how to minimize injury in a fast-moving situation.\\" She added, \\"It's about knowing that you have a clear shot, knowing what's in the background and periphery of the shot.\\" References Category:2018 crimes in the United States Category:2018 in Los Angeles Category:2018 crimes in California Category:Trader Joe's Category:Crimes in Los Angeles Category:Hostage taking in the United States Category:July 2018 events in the United States Category:Attacks in the United States in 2018 Category:Filmed killings by law enforcement ","title":"2018 Trader Joe's hostage incident"},{"id":"57962050","text":"Karen Sundt (23 May 1841 - 1 January 1924) was a Norwegian journalist and writer of popular literature.

He was born in Berlin and studied to become a lawyer.The Times (24 June 1964), p. 15. Before the First World War one of his clients was the Russian Marxist revolutionary Anatoly Lunacharsky. In 1928 he was elected to the Berlin Town Assembly, standing as a Democrat. Eyck also wrote articles for the Vossische Zeitung. However, following the rise of Adolf Hitler, Eyck emigrated to Britain in 1937, living in Boars Hill, Berkshire and Hampstead, London. He took British nationality after 1945. From then on he focused on history, writing biographies of Otto von Bismarck and Wilhelm II, as well as a two-volume history of the Weimar Republic. From early on in his life he had admired Britain's liberal political system and his political beliefs influenced his historical work.Karina Urbach, 'Between Saviour and Villain: 100 Years of Bismarck Biographies', The Historical Journal Vol. 41, No. 4 (Dec., 1998), p. 1153. Eyck wrote that he was \\"of the Liberal persuasion\\" and in 1938 he wrote a biography of the Liberal politician William Ewart Gladstone, who was his ideal statesman.Urbach, pp. 1152-1153. In the early 1940s, he wrote a three- volume biography of Bismarck.Urbach, p. 1152. According to The Times, Eyck was one of the few people to have read all the evidence concerning Bismarck's career. Karina Urbach has written that as \\"a lawyer, Eyck despised Bismarck's lack of respect for the rule of law, and as a liberal he passionately condemned Bismarck's cynicism towards liberal, democratic, and humanitarian ideals\\". Eyck's interpretation was criticised by Hans Rothfels and Franz Schnabel, who argued that Eyck's belief that Germany could have gone down a liberal road was unrealistic and that Germany could have been united only by Bismarck.Urbach, p. 1153. Gerhard Ritter wrote to Eyck, lamenting that his work would confirm the negative impression people abroad had of German history. Eyck enjoyed a friendship with Theodor Heuss, the first President of postwar Germany. In 1953 Heuss awarded him the Grand Cross of Merit.

The episode was written by Awkwafina and Teresa Hsiao. Executive producers were set to include Awkwafina, Karey Dornetto, Peter Principato, and Itay Reiss. Dornetto was also expected to serve as showrunner and Hsiao as a co-executive producer. Production companies involved with the pilot were expected to include Principato-Young Entertainment, later rebranded as Artists First. On November 29, 2018, it was announced that Comedy Central had given the production a series order for a first season consisting of ten episodes. Awkwafina, Hsiao, and Dornetto were set to write for the series and Lucia Aniello was expected to direct and executive produce. The series is set to premiere on January 22, 2020. Ahead of the series premiere, on January 14, 2020, it was reported that Comedy Central renewed the series for a second season. In August 2020, it was announced that the series will be on HBO Max, with the second series airing on the service after its first run broadcast on Comedy Central. =Casting= Alongside the pilot order announcement, it was confirmed that Awkwafina would star in the production. Concurrent with the series order, it was announced that BD Wong and Lori Tan Chinn would star in the series. In July 2019, Chrissie Fit and Jonathan Park joined the cast in recurring roles. On August 14, 2019, Jennifer Esposito was cast in a recurring capacity. =Filming= Principal photography for the pilot began on July 20, 2018 in Queens, New York City, New York. Reception = Critical reception = On Rotten Tomatoes, the series holds an approval rating of 80% with an average rating of 6.75/10, based on 30 reviews. The site's consensus states that \\"Nora From Queens showcases Awkwafina's charming brashness and surrounds her with an equally delightful cast‚Äîespecially scene stealer Lori Tan Chinn‚Äîbut it could stand to walk a less familiar comedic beat.\\" On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 66 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Linda Holmes of NPR states \\"There's a lot of pressure on creators of color to be groundbreaking ‚Äî to sell their shows as both good and somehow ethically nutritious. Awkwafina's place in that calculus is complicated by legitimate questions about her own treatment of cultural traditions she's not part of. But it's also fair to evaluate Awkwafina Is Nora from Queens as an entry in a line of single-camera comedy series amplifying one distinctive sensibility (Insecure, Louie, Chewing Gum, Broad City, even Portlandia). And as part of that line, it holds up well.\\" Awkwafina Is Nora from Queens has been compared to the fellow female-driven Comedy Central hit Broad City, which ran for 6 seasons. =Ratings= The series premiere obtained 0.49 million viewers, making it the highest rated season one premiere for Comedy Central since 2017.

The 2018 Washington Veterans Day Parade (colloquially called \\"Trump's military parade\\") was a planned military parade that would have taken place in Washington, D.C. on November 10, 2018 in honor of the Veterans Day holiday (which took place on 11 November). On August 16, 2018, it was announced that the military parade would be postponed until 2019. In cancelling the parade for 2018, President Donald Trump cited the projected high costs for the parade and blamed Washington DC city officials for the high projected costs.  Background  The parade was expected to include members of all five armed services; the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and the Coast Guard, with other units that were to be dressed in period uniforms representing earlier times in the United States military history. A memo from General Joseph Dunford reported that the parade was to have focused on historic battles and conflicts such as the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. Between 5,000 and 7,000 service members were to have taken part in the parade, which was to begin at the U.S. Capitol and end at the White House. The evolution of women in the service was also to be highlighted in the parade, along with an emphasis on the price of freedom. The parade would have included 100 wheeled vehicles instead of tanks, as well as a heavy air component featuring 50 aircraft at the end of the parade. U.S. President Donald Trump would have been situated in a reviewing area and surrounded by military heroes. Medal of Honor recipients would have been included in reviewing the parade with the President and would have marched in the parade. The parade would also have coincided with the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I. It was to have been the first full scale parade in the nation's capital since 1991 involving the men and women of the active and reserve components of the United States Armed Forces and veterans' organizations and the first national Veterans' Day parade in years. U.S. President Donald Trump requested the military parade following his admiration of the Bastille Day military parade at the Champs-√âlys√©es in Paris which he attended in 2017. = Cancellation of 2018 parade = On August 17, 2018 U.S. President Donald Trump stated that he canceled the parade due to the \\"ridiculous\\" $92 million price tag. Through Twitter he blamed local politicians for the price and suggested hosting another parade in 2019, and ended his tweets with; \\"Maybe we will do something next year in D.C. when the cost comes WAY DOWN. Now we can buy some more jet fighters!\\" In spite of Trump's statements, Budget Director Mick Mulvaney claimed that the cancellation was not just for reasons of cost.  Cost  A Pentagon official estimated the cost of the parade between $3 million and $50 million, earlier in 2018. Another suggestion of the cost was closer to $92 million, with at least $50 million being used to cover Pentagon costs for aircraft, equipment, personnel, and other support. This number was refuted by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis who stated; \\"I'm not dignifying that number ($92 million) with a reply.\\" The $92 million estimate was to be divided between the Defense Department and the Department of Homeland Security, which would have contributed $50 million and $42 million respectively. Separately DC City officials estimated expenses related to the parade would have been $21.6 million with an expectation for reimbursement from the Federal government, with the Mayor of Washington DC Muriel Bowser reporting that $13 million would have been used alone to cover police costs.  Opinion of parade  = Support = In February 2017, very few lawmakers backed the idea of a military parade. Senator David Perdue a Republican of Georgia told reporters \\"He's the President of the United States. Personally, I would prefer not to do it. But he's the president.\\" Senator Lindsey Graham a Republican of South Carolina, supported the parade if it honored the military itself, and not the \\"...Soviet-style hardware display.\\" AMVETS, a group that advocates for military veterans, felt that potentially the parade would inspire more Americans to join the armed forces. = Against = Other politicians spoke out against the parade. Representative Adam Smith a Democrat of Washington and members of the House Armed Services Committee released a statement that highlighted \\"A military parade like this - one that is unduly focused on a single person - is what authoritarian regimes do, not democracies.\\" Senator John Kennedy a Republican of Louisiana told reporters \\"We're not North Korea, we're not Russia, and we're not China and I don't want to be.\\" while speaking out against the proposed parade. Robert O'Neill, a former Navy SEAL, tweeted in February 2018 that any military parade would be \\"...third world bullshit.\\" Other military veterans echoed the sentiment with calls for the money to be spent on housing, employment and mental health care to better support the troops. A veteran of the War in Afghanistan highlighted that it would seem unreasonable to hold a parade in celebration while a 17-year-old war (per 2018) was still ongoing. =Alleged statements on disabled veterans= In an article in September of 2020 in The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg reported that Trump has been fixated on staging military parades for the duration of his presidency. In a 2018 White House planning meeting for such an event, Trump asked his staff not to include wounded veterans, on grounds that spectators would feel uncomfortable in the presence of amputees. ‚ÄúNobody wants to see that,‚Äù he said. https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/trump- americans-who-died-at-war-are-losers-and-suckers/615997/ The former Deputy Secretary of the Middle East and retired Marine Mick Mulroy said that he did not know what was said but did know that our military cemeteries are hallowed ground and always will be and that no person that would be embarrassed by our wounded veterans should \\"ever hold any elected office let alone be the President of the United States.‚Äú https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2020/09/trumps-reported-loser-remarks-give- biden-opening/168260/ See also *Grand Review of the Armies *National Victory Celebration *New York at War *New York City Victory Parade of 1946 *Salute to America *Veterans Day Parade (New York City) References Washington Veterans Day Parade Category:Cancelled events in the United States Category:Military parades in the United States Category:November 2018 events in the United States Category:Presidency of Donald Trump Category:Trump administration controversies ","title":"2018 Washington Veterans Day Parade"},{"id":"57962201","text":"The Rapidan Dam is a concrete gravity dam located on the Blue Earth River in Rapidan Township, near Rapidan, Minnesota in the United States.

Son-Tinh originated from an area of low pressure over the Philippine Sea on July 15, 2018. Moving quickly westwards, Son-Tinh strengthened to the ninth tropical storm of the annual typhoon season on July 17. Intensifying only slightly while crossing the South China Sea, Son-Tinh made its first landfall over Hainan Island on July 18. After emerging into the Gulf of Tonkin, Son-Tinh restrengthened before making its second landfall as a tropical storm in Northern Vietnam on July 19. Once inland, Son-Tinh weakened into a low pressure area as it slowed and made a clockwise loop. The remnants of Son-Tinh then emerged back over water and regenerated into a tropical depression late on July 21. The storm caused severe floods and mudslides in Vietnam, leading to the death of at least 32 people. Over of agricultural land was inundated and at least 17,000 farm animals were swept away by the floods. The storm also caused or related to the havoc in the neighbouring country of Laos with the collapse of Attapeu dam, in which 40 people died and 98 more missing (and probably as much as 1,100 more people are missing) and 6,600 more are displaced.  Meteorological history  An area of low pressure strengthened into a tropical depression on July 15, to the northwest of Manila, Philippines. Accordingly, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) designated it as 11W while the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) gave it the local name Henry. As the system moved westward at high speed, it gradually intensified as its convective structure improved, and strengthened a tropical storm by July 17, with the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) assigning the system the international name Son-Tinh. Thereafter, however, Son-Tinh weakened slightly as it neared Hainan island due to moderate vertical wind shear. Continuing to struggle to maintain intensity amid increasing wind shear, Son-Tinh crossed over Hainan island at around 03:00 UTC on July 18; despite land interaction the system continued to maintain its overall convective organization. Later that day, as Son-Tinh emerged from land into the Gulf of Tonkin, Son-Tinh managed to intensify over the warm waters, with sea surface temperatures of over contributing to offset otherwise unfavorable upper atmospheric conditions. Before making landfall in Northern Vietnam, the JMA reported that Son-Tinh reached peak intensity with 10-minute sustained winds of 75 km/h (45 mph) and a central pressure of . Once inland over Northern Vietnam, Son-Tinh began to weaken quickly. Both the JMA, RFE and JTWC issued their final warnings on Son-Tinh on July 19 as the system degenerated into an area of low pressure embedded in the monsoon. The JTWC, however, continued to track Son- Tinh's remnants for the next two days. Through July 19 and 20, Son-Tinh's remnants curved northwards and then eastwards over Northern Vietnam, before moving southeastward back into the Gulf of Tonkin on July 21. Persistent convection developed over the system, aided by a tropical upper tropospheric trough to the northeast, prompting the JTWC to begin issuing advisories on Son-Tinh once again on July 21. Simultaneously the JMA reported that Son-Tinh had regenerated into a tropical depression. With vertical wind shear now low and sea surface temperatures remaining high near , the JTWC stated that Son- Tinh intensified back into a tropical storm on July 22, while the JMA continued to maintain Son-Tinh as a tropical depression.  Preparations and impact  = China = Total economic loss nationwide were at ¬•240 million (US$35.7 million). = Vietnam = On July 18, the Vietnamese government ordered all vessels to return to port. In Vietnam, the Thanh H√≥a and Ngh·ªá An provinces suffered the most damage, especially with the wake of the storm continuing to generate significant rainfall. It caused major flooding in Northern Vietnam and the capital city of Hanoi. 35 people were killed, more than 5,000 houses, of crops, and 17,000 farm animals were either swept away, submerged, or otherwise destroyed. The storm has cut off access to several areas in the country and flood water covers several streets in the capital city. Economic losses were estimated to be ‚Ç´6.615 trillion (US$287 million). = Laos = On July 23, a hydroelectric dam under construction in Attapeu Province, south-east Laos, collapsed. As of September 25, 40 people were confirmed dead, at least 98 more were missing (and probably as much as 1,100 more people are missing) and 6,600 others were displaced.

It was built from 1830 to 1850 by William Rutledge and later his brother Thomas Rutledge. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The botanist Allan Cunningham journeyed across the Molonglo Plains in April 1824 while leading an expedition into southern New South Wales. He called this flat country Marley's Plains, unaware they had also been called Friday's Plains two years earlier. Both names were superseded by use of the word \\"Molonglo\\". In 1835 Cunningham's younger brother Richard, the Superintendent of the Sydney Botanic Garden, was clubbed to death by aborigines while accompanying the NSW Surveyor-General Thomas Mitchell on his second journey of exploration. Allan Cunningham replaced Richard as Superintendent.Barrow, 2005, 71 The land (2560 acres/1036 ha)Cantlon, 1981, 97 was granted in 1828 to Henry Gilbert Smith who formed the station.NTA, 1976 Smith arrived in Sydney in 1827.Barrow, 2005, 72 Use of the name Carwoola dates from at least 1850 and may be a derivation of the word Carrowillah, mentioned as early as 1827. Carwoola or Carrowillah is said to be an Aboriginal word for \\"the meeting of the waters on the plain\\", a lyrical, apt title because Carwoola station lies on river flats between hills bisected by the Molonglo River, which is fed by numerous streams. The meaning may also be found in the fact that Primrose Creek, a southern tributary of the Molonglo, meets that river to the north-east of St. Thomas' Anglican Church, built on Carwoola land. An historian writing in 1938 claimed that 'The Molonglo River was known to the Aborigines as the Yealambidgee, meaning a chain of waterholes, and the plains on the watershed of this river above Carwoola Gap as Molinggoolah, which name has been corrupted into the modern Molonglo. Moolinggoolah was subdivided by the Aborigines into Carwoola (still retained) and Enwoola (now Foxlow), meaning the centre and the end of the plain below and above the junction of the Tirralilly River.' The origins of Carwoola began with the construction of several small slab dwellings by Edward John Eyre. Eyre, later to become a famous explorer, bought 1260 acres from Smith in 1834 at 4 shillings an acre. Smith sold the land in 1836 to William Rutledge.Purves & Darlington, 2006, 30, 97 Rutledge bought Eyre's two blocks in 1837. Later, Rutledge is said to have bought \\"The Briars\\", a nearby property on which two early stone cottages still stand. This land belonged to William Balcombe who went overland to Port Phillip with William Rutledge in 1838 and later settled at The Briars, Mornington Peninsula, Victoria. It is possible that Gilbert Henry Smith and/or William Rutledge might have been responsible for the earlier buildings. The buildings surviving today were built by William and Thomas Rutledge in the late 1830s. The National Trust of Australia says it was sold to William Rutledge in 1836, adding that Thomas Rutledge settled here and built the present house probably prior to his marriage in 1849Roxburgh, 1974, pp. 72-74, 97 to his first cousin, Martha Forster of Brush Farm (Eastwood, Sydney). In 1839 Rutledge's brother Thomas had sailed to Australia and become Carwoola's manager. He was only in his early 20s and developed extensive pastoral interests including the purchase of Carwoola. William Rutledge settled in Victoria where he became known as \\"terrible Billy\\" for his explosive temper and unreserved use of \\"the language of a centurion\\". Thomas Rutledge later became owner of Carwoola. The Rutledges gradually extended their holdings so that by the 1870s they controlled about 90,000 acres (by 1877 Carwoola and another Rutledge property, Gidleigh, totalled 90,000 acres (36,450ha) and Carwoola became the centre of rural hospitality in the district.Branch Managers Report to the Heritage Council 22 June 1979 Under Thomas Rutledge, Carwoola became a most important centre, catering for the needs of neighbouring settlers and passing travellers.NTA (NSW), 1976 Its homestead was being described as architecturally \\"of the modern style\\". It was said that it 'comprises two stories, and is built of the best materials, with a verandah around three sides... All the usual appurtenances belonging to a well-appointed station are here also, such as store, post office...Telegraph office...and several cottages for the hands employed. In 1848 Rutledge gave a ball at Carwoola, one of the guests being Stewart Mowle who had to ride through a threatening windstorm to get there. Mowle's diaries record his dislike of the Rutledges: \\"Rutledge, a very common North of Ireland man, as the Rutledges are...\\". Others saw Rutledge differently. He became a prominent breeder of fast racehorses and when he died in 1904, aged 86, was called \\"a great sporting enthusiast...He owned and bred some of the best horses in the district\\". An obituary notice described him as \\"most hospitable, generous, sympathetic and broad minded...(with) a bright and genial disposition\\". His widow Martha survived him by five years, dying in 1909.Barrow, 2005, 72-73 Thomas and Martha Rutledge lie today in the small graveyard of St. Thomas' Anglican Church, whose iron roof and steeple are just visible from Carwoola's second entrance gate, 2 km away on the Captain's Flat Road. The church was built on land donated by Rutledge and was the work of noted church architect and builder, the Rev. Alberto Soares. It was built between 1872‚Äì4, and consecrated in 1876. Its prominent east window depicting St. Thomas and Christ was presented in 1873 by Sir Edward Knox and his wife, Martha, who was Thomas Rutledge's sister. Sir Edward Knox founded the Colonial Sugar Refining Co. and had many other business interests. Mrs Elizabeth Falkiner of Foxlow presented a stile to give access (over the fence) into the grounds, but over the years this has been removed. Like the Rutledges, Mrs Falkiner and her husband, Franc Brereton Sadlier Falkiner, are buried next to each other in this graveyard.Barrow, 2005, 74 In its heyday from 80-100 people lived here, with old married men's quarters (with one room each) and young married men's quarters (with two rooms each) Carwoola passed into the hands of a South Australian, James Maslin, in 1907 and at the time of the sale was a station of 40,000 acres (16,200ha) carrying 12,000 sheep The wartime death of his 21-year-old son, Jim, is recorded in an inscription on a window in St. Thomas's Anglican Church, Carwoola. Jim was killed in France in action in 1917 and the church window depicts a uniformed soldier. A wall tablet, erected by Alice Thornton Mills, also commemorates Jim Maslin. Thomas Rutledge who also helped fund the church, as well as donating the land, is remembered twice - on a plaque and a memorial window. It is possible that the graveyard may have been in use before the church was built because an inscription on what is called the Bowen family vault honours the 1788 convict Owen Bowen who died in 1840. After gaining his ticket-of-occupation for 100 acres of land, making him the \\"first authorised occupant to reside on a large holding in the district\\". Bowen arrived on the scene in 1811.Barrow, 2005, 75 James Maslin by 1928 had grown the property to 25,778 acres. In 1928 it was subdivided and sold off in 7 blocks. The sales poster described the property as \\"high class grazing, breeding and fattening country on the favoured Southern Tablelands\\". The \\"homestead\\" block of 8189 acres was described: as \\"built of stone, and out buildings are palatial, and with its surroundings and ornamental trees remind one of an English home. All modern conveniences, including water, electric light and sewerage are installed\\". In 1929 the homestead was described as: 'a comfortable two-storied stone building...The house has 16 rooms in the main building, including a magnificent billiard room...Outside the home one finds pretty gardens laid out in striking formation, above which tower beautiful English trees, including the elm, oak....Barrow, 2005, 73 The property was owned by the Scott family from the 1920s until 1972. In 1979 the then owner of Carwoola requested the placement of a Permanent Conservation Order and sought technical advice from the Heritage Council. Following a site visit by the Heritage and Conservation branch and in recognition of its historic and aesthetic significance a Permanent Conservation Order was placed over the property on 21 December 1979. It was transferred to the State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  Description  Carwoola is an early colonial homestead complex containing a large number of early buildings set in an impressive rural landscape of natural and man-made elements.LEP, 2014 The site has important historical associations and was a centre of rural hospitality in the district during the later part of the 19th century. The site has significant historic values as evidence of early pastoral development and achievement. The homestead complex with its wide variety of out-buildings in both stone and slab, was described in 1866 as 'the magnificent property of Thomas Rutledge, Esq. Which may be termed \\"the model farm Par Excellence of NSW\\". It could equally be described as the nineteenth century homestead par excellence because of its completeness.Cantlon, 1981, 96 The farm today is 5000 acres. =Inner homestead complex= The central main house is a two- storied Georgian block flanked on either side by single storey wings that project in front to form a verandah. At the rear of the house two stone wings, built separately, enclose a sheltered court yard, around which are a number of early outbuildings, namely a stone hayshed, stone stables, several stone workman's cottages and a slab hut and stables. The main block's architecture is strong, simple and unpretentious. There is also another single storey section at the rear with a skillion roof from the main house. A large U-shaped homestead built in at least two different stages with a wide variety of out- buildings in both stone and slab. The main facade consists of a two-storied section flanked on either side by two single-storied wings, each of three rooms. The impression is one of grandeur, so it is surprising to find that the central two-storied section consists of but two main rooms downstairs and one large and two smaller bedrooms upstairs. Apart from differences in proportion between the central section and wings, there are indications that the two sections are not contemporaneous. On the rear wall, a mark in the cement render occurs at the junction of the two sections and whereas the central section is built on a plinth, the walls of the wings at the rear are in one plane to ground level Possibly the earliest part of the homestead itself is the north-wing at the rear, a building with a Dutch gable (jerkin roofed). Part of this seven-roomed building is finished in a way which suggests that it could well have been living quarters, perhaps the earliest homestead. Later it was probably used as storage space, augmented by the pine-lined loft which runs the full length of the building. There is also a loft above half of the parallel (southern) kitchen wing which could well be a later building, contemporaneous perhaps with the central two-storied section. The upper storey has five symmetrically disposed windows (to the east/front) which are shown with shutters in early oil paintings at Carwoola. The front door which consists of two vertical panels and sidelights opens into a hall with an elegant staircase and fine straight balusters. To the right is the large sitting room with an exquisitely restrained white marble fireplace, said to be the signed work of the 19th century neoclassical sculptor, Canova. To the left of the hall is the dining room, lit, as is the sitting room, by a pair of tall four-paned sash windows. The woodwork for the six-panelled doors, windows and original mantelpieces is (red) cedar. Certain alterations have been made to the mantelpieces: one was removed to accommodate the Canova mantelpiece and one removed to make way for a wooden one in the taste of the 1920s. However, there are numerous typically Georgian mantelpieces throughout the homestead. This suggests that the addition of the single storied wings might have taken place within a short period of time after the two storied section. Throughout the house is fine cedar joinery, six panelled doors, cantilevered stair, large sash windows with small panes and simple Georgian fireplace surrounds. The windows in the wings are flanked by unusual extra side lights and have cedar shutters which fold into the reveals. =Outbuildings= The number of (out-)buildings is so great that much time could be spent in attempting to work out the order of growth of the homestead complex. Homestead and outbuildings erected over a period between about 1830 to 1850. Most buildings are of the local hard rubble stone, originally white-washed. The outbuildings are not only noteworthy as vernacular forms. but also for the interesting groupings that they create in their impressive garden setting. ;Stone Block Containing the Meat Room, Coach House, two suites of two rooms, cell with only one barred window and an old kitchen with flagged floor - this block is most striking. Behind this section an enormously-long high stone wall extends protecting the remains of the kitchen garden in which an old mulberry, a walnut and a fig tree survive. On one side are small skillion rooms used as harness store and saddle shop with a saddle store on the other side. A loft runs the full length of this building. ;Stone Stables (nearby the Stone Block, above) 'A hell of a big building for five bloody horses'. ;Slab Stables Slab building for horse stalls where the slabs are set vertically on large horizontal logs. ;Slab shed Beyond the slab stables is a slab building which may have been a salt shed set on piers. ;Barn of rubble stone (beyond the slab salt shed) with walls 2 ft (0.6m) thick. On either side of the buildings are large openings to allow for hay drays pulled by six or eight horses. ;Blacksmith's Shop Still functioning in part is the two storied slab blacksmith's shop and coach house, the sturdy box uprights of which are charred black as a prevention against white ants. ;Cottages Some early cottages not far from the homestead are now contained within later additions. ;Shearing Shed This is on other side of the entrance drive from the main gate, with an early small stone house. =Yards and Garden= The homestead is approached via a large complex to its west comprising a shelter belt of Monterey pines (Pinus radiata) perpendicular to the road and passing a full suite of rural outbuildings, yards and appurtenances and a recent manager's house to the south. The homestead complex is set in an impressive garden setting. The current owners have re-established the oak-lined original driveway (which approaches the house from the north-west). A rear driveway approaches from due west of the homestead along the shelter belt of Monterey pines. The sizeable pond at the front (east) is an addition, and has been extended twice. Mature oaks (Quercus robur) and elms (Ulmus procera) allow winter sun in, allowing naturalised spring European bulbs such as daffodils and jonquils (Narcissus spp.), star flowers (Ipheion sp.), star-of-Jerusalem (Ornithogalum umbellatum) and winter or Lenten roses (Helleborus niger and Helleborus orientalis) to flourish below. Summer brings roses and lavender flowers (Lavandula sp.). A mature Bunya pine (Araucaria bidwillii) is north- east of the homestead - the current owner has added a second young Bunya pine. Younger plantings include red and pink-flowered crab apples (Malus spp./cv.s), winter honeysuckle (Lonicera fragrantissima), Persian lilac (Syringa persica / S.p.'Meyeri'), golden chain tree (Laburnum rossii) and Japanese or flowering quince (Chaenomeles speciosa). A large vegetable garden is north of the outbuilding complex north and west of the homestead, providing year-round food for the family, along with salad greens and citrus from a glasshouse, built in the back of the old stables. An old walnut (Juglans regia) and mulberry (Morus nigra) tree shelter in the lee of tall brick walls facing north. Apple trees and a chicken palace are also in this area. A recently planted trufferie is nearby. An enormously-long high stone wall extends protecting the remains of the kitchen garden in which an old mulberry, a walnut and a fig tree survive.

It was built from 1827 by William Ryrie. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999.  History  Arnprior has associations with the Ryrie family, dating to the 1820s. Scottish-born Stewart Ryrie (1778‚Äì1852) immigrated to Australia in 1825 on board the Triton with his second wife Isabella Ryrie (n√©e Cassels) and the six children from his first marriage. Ryrie's two eldest sons were William (born ) and James (born ). Stewart Ryrie had served as a deputy assistant commissary general in the British Army during the Peninsular War in 1808‚Äì1815, stationed in Spain and Portugal. On arrival to Sydney in October 1825, Ryrie took up an appointment as the deputy assistant commissary general, based at the Commissariat Stores at Circular Quay. On 22 September 1826, William and James Ryrie wrote to the Colonial Secretary Alexander Macleay, stating their intention to \\"reside on the Land to be granted to us\\" as they were unable to find suitable work in Sydney.Edwards 2007: 16 In , William Ryrie was granted Portion 4 of the Parish of Larbert in the County of Murray. Ryrie's grant encompassed 2560 acres and was a roughly rectangular parcel of land located to the north of the Shoalhaven River and to the north-east of the Village of Larbert. It appears that Ryrie's grant had earlier been occupied by a William Bradbury. It appears that Bradbury held a Ticket of Occupation for the land he had been living on at Curraduck-bidgee (Kurraducbidgee) prior to 1826.Edwards 2007: 17 'Bradbury's Station' is shown on Robert Hoddle's 1824 map of the Braidwood District, roughly in the vicinity of Ryrie's grant. Bradbury later moved to the Bungonia area. William Ryrie's land grant was named Arnprior in memory of Isabella Ryrie (n√©e Cassels)'s family home in Scotland. The 1828 Census indicates that a house on William's 2560-acre land grant, Arnprior, was under construction at this time, as was a house on his brother James's grant Durran Durra. The Census recorded that there were 18 people living at Arnprior including workforce of eleven (ten of whom were convicts or ex-convicts). It also recorded that there were 35 acres of cleared land and 23 acres cultivated land at Arnprior, compared to one acre cultivated and cleared land at Durran Durra. Arnprior had 553 head of cattle and 1100 sheep, while Durran Durra had 75 cattle and 540 sheep. The house on William's land holding faced the Shoalhaven River, but was set back from it, possibly because the river was known to regularly flood. Physical inspection of the house suggests that it began modestly (comprising four rooms) and was added to over the nineteenth century to accommodate the extended Ryrie family. The house eventually had thirteen rooms. Stewart Ryrie retired in 1829. The following year, he arrived at Arnprior to live with his wife Isabella and their three young children: John Cassels (b. 1826), Alexander (b. 1827) and David (b. 1829), and it became the family home. William's younger brothers Donald, then 18 years old, and Stewart, aged 16, also lived at Arnprior.Tallaganda Rural Heritage Study 1992; Edwards 2007: 18 Another resident at Arnprior in the 1830s was the Greek-born shepherd Ghikas Boulgaris (aka Jigger Bulgary) who was married to Mary Lyons at the property in 1836. Their two youngest children, Xanthe and Catherine, were born at Arnprior. In 1837, William Ryrie advised the Governor of New South Wales on the best routes and staging posts for a postal service between Melbourne and Sydney.Griffiths 1976: 39; Ellis 1989: 34 In January 1840, the Arnprior land grant was formalised. The 1841 census showed that 48 people were living at Arnprior and Durran Durra in that year. The two properties had been amalgamated following the death of James Ryrie in 1840.Edwards 2007: 19 In 1845, William Ryrie travelled to Scotland where he married his step-mother's sister Marianne Cassels.Griffiths 1976: 39 Although he returned to Australia in the interim, William died in Scotland in 1856.Edwards 2007: 74 In 1852, Stewart Ryrie Snr died. His second youngest son Alexander managed the property until , at which time he moved to the property he had purchased near Canberra named Micalago.(National Library of Australia News July 1996, Vol. 1 No. 10, pp. 3-5: http://www.nla.gov.au/pub/nlanews/1996/jul96/story-1.pdf) Major floods hit the Braidwood and Queanbeyan districts in August 1853. Hobart newspaper The Courier reported that the \\"government township of Larbert was ‚Ä¶ under water, presenting the appearance of another Gundagai\\" and that Arnprior was also \\"surrounded by the flood, but as it stands on higher ground than the opposite side, it escaped destruction\\".Hobart Courier, 8 August 1853: 2 The house at Arnprior \\"extended hospitality to the travellers on the track from Goulburn and Bungonia\\" through to Braidwood, who arrived late at night or were held up by floods at the adjacent ford over the Shoalhaven.Ellis 1989: 34 In 1853, Samuel Mossman and Thomas Bannister published their account of travelling through NSW and Victoria, at which time they visited Braidwood and Arnprior: \\"Further on you come to Arnprior, the estate of Mr. Ryrie in the county of Murray, on the Shoalhaven River, about 152 miles from Sydney. Here there is a considerable quantity of land enclosed, but the property is not highly esteemed; gold has been found upon it, however; and we sincerely hope that it will ultimately be of great value to its possessors.\\"Mossman and Bannister 1853: 182 The Ryrie grant was bisected by a road leading directly north from Braidwood to Bungonia. This road passed directly through the Ryrie property, across the ford at Larbert on the Shoalhaven River and another ford on the Boro Creek, passing through Mayfield and alongside Glen D'Or. There is some suggestion that this was a Cobb and Co route. In the south-west portion of the original Arnprior grant lies a road easement leading to Lake Bathurst through Mayfield.Map of the Parish of Larbert 1924, NLA: http://nla.gov.au/nla.map-vn4274945 The 1867 Postal Directory recorded that Mrs M. A. Ryrie, Helen, Anne, and John Ryrie were residing at Arnprior. These were the wife and children of William Ryrie. Alexander Ryrie purchased the property from his brother John Cassels in either 1867 or 1876.Gary Dutaillis & Associates Pty Ltd 1991: np; Edwards 2007: 19 By the late nineteenth century, the extended Ryrie family had moved away from Arnprior, to the Monaro district and to Port Philip (Melbourne). In 1902, the property passed out of the Ryrie family when it was sold to Frank M. W. Cooper. He in turn sold to John Welsh in 1906. One of Alexander's sons, Vincent, repurchased Arnprior in 1928. It appears that Vincent Ryrie retained Arnprior until the 1950s, at which time it passed through a number of hands: first it was sold to William Hyde, who sold to J. B. Hibberson, who in turn sold to G. L. Gouge.(Gary Dutaillis & Associates Pty Ltd 1991: np) In 1968, the Metropolitan Water Sewerage and Drainage Board proposed a scheme, known as the Shoalhaven Scheme, to supply water to Sydney and the South Coast. The proposed Welcome Reef Dam on the upper Shoalhaven River, in the vicinity of Braidwood, was to be part of the second stage of this scheme. From 1968 through to the mid 1980s, the Water Board set about purchasing privately owned pastoral holdings in the area between Braidwood and Goulburn for the proposed Welcome Reef Dam and catchment area, eventually acquiring 37,000 acres. Arnprior was resumed by the State Government on behalf of the Metropolitan Water Sewerage and Drainage Board at this time. The boundaries of the original land grant to William Ryrie have altered considerably since . Today, the original Arnprior grant has been halved; but it now includes 261 acres of land granted to F. H. R. Martin (Portion 221 of the Parish of Larbert) and part of 80 acres originally owned by John Cassels (Portion 53 in the Parish of Larbert). Arnprior also includes part of the Village of Larbert, namely the church and the cemetery.  Description  The property is accessed from Mayfield Road along a gravel drive. Near to this intersection is the former township of Larbert, and within the Arnprior boundary are the stone foundations of a former church, small cemetery and several mature pine trees. A cottage with attic roof and the ruin of a single storey structure just outside the Arnprior boundary are also likely to be part of the former township of Larbert. The homestead of Arnprior is set on a plateau overlooking expansive plains and grazing country to the east and toward the Shoalhaven River, the land gently sloping up to the rear. Directly in front of the residence are the remains of an early orchard, yucca sp. and a grouping of mature radiata pines. Outbuildings and other mature cultural plantings are located to the west and south of the homestead. The Arnprior property comprises the following elements: * Homestead () * Cottage (1970s) * Outbuildings and cattleyards * Church footings and cemetery * Landscaping ;Homestead () Arnprior Homestead is reputed to have been constructed between 1827 and 1830. The earliest parts of the homestead would appear to be the four central rooms located under a double hip roof. This section has timber framed with beaded weatherboard walls and two central rubble stone chimneys. Rubble stone (rendered) additions on either side possibly date from the s. Other later additions and alterations, and major internal alterations include wall relining s and s; and s verandah enclosures, kitchen fitout, shower and lavatory facilities within the eastern enclosed verandah. The eastern verandah is enclosed with modern profile steel sheeting and later windows and fibre cement internal linings. The various construction stages are legible in the roof line, as no attempt has been made to consolidate and form one roof. As such the roof is a mixture of double hip, and skillion roof forms, and is clad with corrugated iron, although the original timber shingles to the central double hip roofs remain beneath. In addition to the two central chimneys, two other similar chimneys are located at the northern and southern side of the homestead. The rubble masonry walls have been roughcast externally and plastered internally. Internally many of the original lath and plaster walls have been lined over in the 1920s or recently removed. The original ceilings of lath and plaster have fallen away and were relined in the 1920s and again in the 1980s. A number of walls have been exposed, and internally the timber stud frame walls show evidence of original lath and plaster as well as early wallpaper coverings. Original floorboards remain. One early cedar chimney piece remains, while other chimney pieces have been either removed or replaced with modern face brick surrounds. There is other evidence of early skirting and dado and picture rails behind later wall linings. A hand carved cedar door architrave remains to the original front door, and features a distinctive thistle motif. All window joinery is later, apart from original but altered window sashes to the weatherboard walls. A cellar is located under the southern 1840s addition to the homestead, and has granite walls, dirt floor and the remains of a lathe and plaster ceiling. Many of the locks are later possibly s. Evidence remains of the evolution of the building through its present exposed structure. The eastern verandah has a later concrete floor covering original stone flags. The original verandah posts have been replaced with steel poles, however the original verandah beam remains in place. Stabilisation works including window, roof, drainage, render and other propping works were completed on the building August 1995. A random rubble wall located in the north-west corner of the homestead relates to a previous wing of the house. ;Cottage (1970s) A small s prefabricated cottage is located some 200m to the south of the homestead. This is a simple timber framed and weatherboard clad building that is set on a red brick base, with a gable roof of corrugated iron. Externally the building fabric appears sound, although external paintwork has largely peeled away and roof drainage items are missing. Internally the cottage comprises several small bedrooms, bathroom, kitchen and open lounge/dining area. The interior appears to be undergoing refurbishment, with new kitchen fitout and paintwork generally. ;Outbuildings and cattleyards Outbuildings at Arnprior include a machinery shed, garage and hayshed located to the rear (west) of the homestead. Of these the hayshed would appear to be the earliest, and has a bush pole framed construction with corrugated iron roof and wall sheeting. There is no evidence of a former shearing shed or sheep runs located behind the hayshed, save for a pile of aged timber. Metal cattle yards adjacent to the hayshed are modern. A second hayshed is located on the eastern side of Mayfield Road and has a similar bush pole and corrugated iron construction. The machinery shed is a steel framed shed, open on one side, with modern metal profile wall and roof sheeting. Adjacent a former garage is timber framed and has modern metal sheeting to walls and corrugated iron to the roof. A timber framed skillion addition on one side is partially collapsed. A late 20th century corrugated iron shearing shed is located some 500m to the north of the house. This shearing shed is in a largely dilapidated state, with the collapse of the western end of the shed and loss of much of the corrugated iron wall sheeting. ;Church footings and Larbert Cemetery Located near to the entrance to Arnprior on Mayfield Road, are the rubble stone footings and concrete entrance steps of a small rectangular former church. On either side are two mature pine trees, which may be contemporary with the church. A small cemetery is located on the rise behind the former church, which includes marble and sandstone headstones for members of the Roberts, Bassingthwaighte and Stephens's families who died at the end of the 19th and first decades of the 20th centuries. The headstones are generally in fair condition. ;Landscaping The immediate area around the homestead and outbuildings contains several mature plantings, including remains of former orchard, yucca sp and group of radiata pines in front of the homestead; rows of mature conifers to the south and west of the homestead complex as well as substantial poplars. Immediately behind the homestead complex is a series of cleared paddocks, which rise to form a small ridge with natural bush land setting. The homestead was reported as being in poor condition as at 30 July 2009. Arnprior has a moderate degree of integrity. It has remnant elements of the original 1820s landscape including the main homestead, cleared home paddocks, orchard and early road remains as well as archaeological evidence of early staff accommodation and the remains of Larbert township. The property has lost all of its original outbuildings although some archaeological evidence of these may remain. The archaeological evidence throughout the property is likely to retain a moderate to high degree of integrity although there is evidence of some recent disturbance due to ploughing.  Heritage listing  Arnprior is of State significance as one of the earliest land grants and settlements in the Shoalhaven River area, which is able to demonstrate patterns of land allocation and use in southern NSW during the early decades of the NSW colony, particularly the granting of land to early free settlers and the surveying of roads and town reserves in settled districts in the 1820s and 30s. This is evidenced through the known (church and cemetery) and potential archaeological evidence of the early township of Larbert located within the property of Arnprior. Arnprior is of Local significance for its association with the Ryrie family, who were prominent land owners and settlers in southern NSW. As one of the earliest Ryrie-owned properties it provides evidence of the changing fortunes of the Ryrie family and the growth of their prominence in southern NSW. Arnprior is of State significance for its ability to demonstrate the operation of early colonial pastoral properties with assigned convict labour and use of local Aboriginal labour, as demonstrated through the mix of homestead, early sheds and potential archaeological evidence of convict housing associated with the property. Arnprior is a Locally representative example of early colonial settlements in NSW, retaining its original homestead and a range of archaeological remains and landscape features associated with early occupation. This significance has been compromised however through the loss of all of the original outbuildings, as well as intrusive alterations to the homestead itself. Despite these however, there is sufficient detail within the homestead to provide evidence of its earliest construction and subsequent phases of development, as well as early 19th to early 20th century vernacular construction techniques generally. The property has State significance for its landscape qualities. The grouping of the homestead on the rise amongst a setting of large mature conifers, with cleared paddocks around Gilberts Creek and the ruin of the shearing shed, evoke the earliest days of settlement within southern NSW, particularly when viewed from Mayfield Road. Arnprior was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Arnprior has State heritage significance under this criterion. Arnprior has historic significance as one of the earliest land grants in the Shoalhaven River area, which retains physical evidence of the earliest settlement on the property in the form of the homestead and archaeological evidence dating from . The property is able to demonstrate patterns of land allocation and use in southern NSW, particularly the granting of land to early free settlers and the surveying of roads and town reserves in the settled districts in the 1820s and 30s. The property also has the potential to demonstrate the operation of early colonial pastoral properties with its assigned convict labour and use of local Aboriginal labour. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Arnprior has Local heritage significance under this criterion. Arnprior is directly associated with the notable Ryrie family. The Ryries were key pioneering settlers in southern NSW, known particularly around the Snowy Mountains area. Their first major landholding in Australia was at Arnprior, and tells of the changing fortunes and rising prominence of the Ryrie family in comparison to their later properties. Arnprior still retains evidence associated with the early Ryrie occupation of the property including the main homestead with its carved thistle motif over the front door. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Arnprior has State heritage significance under this criterion. The grouping of the main homestead on the rise with the cleared paddocks around Gilberts Creek, the large plantings of conifers around the house and the ruin of the shearing shed to the north present a pleasing Australian rural landscape, particularly when viewed from Mayfield Road. The original form of the house within the cleared home paddocks is able to evoke the earliest days of settlement within the region of southern NSW with the views from Mayfield Road remaining much as they would have appeared to early travellers in the district. The homestead has technical significance as an example of a colonial rural homestead, although this significance has been compromised by later intrusive modifications. Despite these however, there is sufficient detail within the homestead to provide evidence of its earliest construction and subsequent phases of development, as well as early 19th to early 20th century vernacular construction techniques generally. The cedar door architrave with thistle motif is a detail distinctive to Arnprior, and provides physical evidence of the importance to the Ryrie family to demonstrate their ancestry at their new home at Arnprior. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The social significance of Arnprior has not been formally assessed through community consultation. However, it is likely that the property would retain significance to the Ryrie family, a family of note in the history of NSW, as the first family property in Southern NSW, as well as the local historical society and potentially people throughout the State with an interest in early colonial architecture and settlement patterns. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Arnprior has potential State heritage significance under this criterion. Archaeological evidence associated with early colonial occupation of NSW is becoming increasingly rare. In particular, little archaeological work has been undertaken into the system of convict housing and work in rural areas, outside the confines of established secondary prisons, asylums and concentrated convict settlements in townships such as Parramatta and Port Macquarie. Arnprior has the potential to reveal information about the lives and works of assigned convicts that is not available in written records. The main homestead building also has considerable research potential. Little has been found in historic records about the original construction or the numerous changes made to the building throughout its life. Layers of fabric associated with these changes are likely to remain and add to our knowledge of the various stages of development at the property and early nineteenth century building techniques. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Arnprior has State heritage significance under this criterion. Arnprior contains a range of architectural and archaeological evidence from the earliest days of European settlement in southern NSW. Although there are a number of early homesteads remaining in the southern tablelands, Arnprior is particularly early and retains an unusual range of evidence including the remains of the village of Larbert, church and cemetery, and potentially convict housing associated with Arnprior itself. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Arnprior has Local heritage significance under this criterion. Arnprior is representative of early colonial settlements in southern NSW, retaining its original homestead and a range of archaeological remains and landscape features associated with the early occupation. It is not an exceptional representative example as it has lost all of its original outbuildings and there have been a number of intrusive changes to the main house.

It was built from 1830 to 1925. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999.  History  The Roberts family settled in the Braidwood district in the mid 1830s, and have associations with the pastoral properties known as Mayfield, Virginia and Ooranook. John Cocking, born in Nottingham in 1791, was married to Anna Maria Whitmore in London in 1816. It appears that the couple had eight children born between 1816 and 1834, and also changed their surname to Roberts during this time. In 1834, Maria Roberts and her children boarded the Margaret bound for Sydney, Australia, accompanied by her brother-in-law Robert Roberts (who had also changed his name) and his wife Mary. It is not known when John Roberts arrived in Sydney, but it is speculated that he had arrived before his wife and brother to search for suitable land for the families to settle. It is also possible that John Roberts was a \\"remittance man\\", meaning that his family paid him to stay away.(Hush 2008: 235) Shortly after disembarkation, the two Roberts families lived on Kent Street in Sydney's Rocks area, but moved to the Braidwood district by November 1835. At this time, John Roberts' request to purchase 100 acres at Boro Creek Swamp \\"to enable him to erect a warehouse and establishment for the convenience of travellers and acting as a Veterinary Surgeon and Farrier\\" had been granted.Roberts : 4 The land grant referred to was Portion 1 of the Parish of Nadgigomar, County of Argyle; this parcel of land was to the north of the Boro Creek. Today this land is within the boundaries of the Mayfield estate, as defined by the SCA in 2009. John Roberts built the Star and Garter Inn on this land grant in . He held the license for the Star and Garter Inn in 1836 and 1837; his brother Robert Roberts was a publican here also.Roberts : 2 In March 1836, John Roberts purchased 200 acres of land on the Boro Creek (Portion 43 of the Parish of Larbert) which later became the foundation of Mayfield. This parcel of land was in the vicinity of \\"Bora\\", which was one of three stations marked by Assistant Surveyor Robert Hoddle on his map of the district in 1824.State Records, Robert Hoddle, Plan of Shoalhaven River from Bradbury's Station to Tombye of Jenkins, 1824, Plan No. V.515, SZ508 \\"Bora\\" is also marked on a 1924 Parish Map of Larbert, on a bend of the Shoalhaven River, just south of where Virginia homestead is located today. This portion of land is no longer part of the Virginia Estate, as defined by the SCA in 2009.NLA Map: http://nla.gov.au/nla.map-vn4274945 It is probable that Bora gave the Boro River and Boro district their names. Charles James Bullivant had been promised this land, described as 640 acres of land \\"at Kurraducbidgee\\", in 1825. At this time it was a \\"cattle station\\" which was being run by Mr Faithful, who would later settle at Springfield. There were delays in officially granting the land to Bullivant as the land had not been properly surveyed. In 1827, Bullivant wrote to the Lands Department stating that his grant was 'called \\"Bora\\" and [is] at present occupied as a run by Mr Faithful on the north side of the Shoal Haven'.State Records, Colonial Secretary's Papers, Item 2/7959, COD 551 Bullivant came free on the Ocean in 1816 and was a former officer of the 46th Regiment. Although his correspondence with the Lands Office suggests that he planned to move to his rural seat, he continued to live on Cumberland Street in The Rocks and later moved to North Sydney, where he became the publican at the Rag and Famish Hotel. Bullivant sold his cattle station to John Roberts in , in the same year it had been officially granted to him. In January 1840, Anna Maria Roberts, the abandoned wife of John Roberts, sold 300 acres of land ('being Portion 43 of the Parish of Larbert, 200 acres, and Portion 1 of the Parish of Nadgigomar, 100 acres') to Thomas and Luke Hyland for ¬£500.Roberts : 2-3 She and her children remained living at Virginia. The 1841 census records that there were 16 people living at Virginia in this year. The Virginia homestead is to the west of Mayfield. Virginia is located on part of Portion 44 in the Parish of Larbert, which originally comprised 640 acres to the south of the Boro Creek and to the north of the Shoalhaven River. It appears that this original land grant has been subdivided and that the southernmost portion, which sat on a bend in the Shoalhaven River, is no longer within the boundaries of Virginia as defined by the SCA in 2009. The site of the homestead is shown on a 1924 Parish Map of Larbert. In March 1836, John Roberts purchased this 640 acre grant from Bullivant for ¬£550 and named the property Virginia Waters.Hush 2008: 230 Roberts was officially granted this land on 26 October 1840. By this time, he had left Australia for a new life in New Zealand. There is some suggestion that there was a flood soon after the Roberts family moved to Virginia in the 1830s and 1840s, and that the bark hut in which they were living was swept away, which drowned two of their small children. However, there is no record of any deaths of children born to John and Anna Roberts in the Births, Deaths and Marriages Register, in this period. Peter Roberts, born in England in 1823, was the fifth child born to John and Anna Maria Roberts. He married Jane Oakenden at Goulburn in 1862. Peter and Jane Roberts continued to live at Virginia after their marriage, and Peter farmed the property. They had nine children including Peter (b. 1865) and Henry Oakenden Roberts (b. 1872). In 1870, Peter and Jane were flooded out and \\"he decided to build a new home on higher ground.\\". Peter Roberts died at Virginia on 28 June 1890, aged 67 years old. He was survived by his wife Jane, who died on 28 March 1916, when she was 72 years old. Both were buried at the Larbert Cemetery.Roberts : 11 A part-time school was operating at Virginia with schools located on nearby pastoral properties: Durran Durra from 1894 to 1896 and Manar from 1896 to 1899. (Department of Education 1993: 144). The homestead on the Virginia estate was rebuilt in 1915-25 by a member of the Roberts family, possibly Peter Roberts Jnr (b. 1865), who lived at Virginia until he retired to Goulburn. Peter's son Oscar (b. 1900) continued to reside at Virginia \\"making four generations to reside at Virginia\\". When Oscar Roberts retired to Braidwood, he sold Virginia to Denzil Sturgiss.. In 1968, the Metropolitan Water Sewerage and Drainage Board proposed a scheme, known as the Shoalhaven Scheme, to supply water to Sydney and the South Coast. The proposed Welcome Reef Dam on the upper Shoalhaven River, in the vicinity of Braidwood, was to be part of the second stage of this scheme. From 1968 through to the mid 1980s, the Board set about purchasing privately owned pastoral holdings in the area between Braidwood and Goulburn for the proposed Welcome Reef Dam and catchment area, eventually acquiring 37,000 acres. Virginia was resumed by the Government of New South Wales on behalf of the Metropolitan Water Sewerage and Drainage Board at this time. The estate now defined by the SCA as Virginia only includes land to the south of the Boro Creek. Most of this land remains as bushland, and has only been cleared on the frontage to the Boro Creek. Little Forest Creek runs north-south through the estate.  Description  The original property was settled in the 1840s as Virginia and has historically been one of the more substantial landholdings in the district. The homestead complex is located off Stewarts Crossing Road on a small hill overlooking cleared plains to the river flats of the Shoalhaven River, with rolling hills beyond. The land rises behind the homestead to the north-west, forming a backdrop of natural bushland. The homestead is skirted by large original Monterey pines. The various structures at Virginia include: * Homestead (s) * Laundry (mid 19th century) * Landscaping * Slab Shed (mid 19th century) * Garage (late 19th century) * Staff cottage (-30s) * Outbuildings (chicken sheds, slaughter house and fibro shed) * Shearing Shed and yards (mid-late 19th century) * School house (mid-late 19th century) ;Homestead (s) The present homestead is a timber framed and weatherboard clad structure that looks to date s. It has a hipped and gable roof form clad with corrugated iron, the gable ends being battened with lattice at high level, and two face brick chimneys. There are small verandahs at the north-east and south-east corners which feature alternate wide and narrow timber balustrades and friezes. Windows are a mix of multi paned casement or two-light double hung sash. Exposed rafters are below double v-jointed boarding to the eaves. The base of the house is rough-cast, masonry and reasonably intact overall. Tin vents are located at high levels on the walls. Within the sub-floor on the eastern side of the house are the remains of a rubble stone wall, which may be the 1870s cottage. Internally the homestead is in good condition and retains many of its original finishes and features. Walls are battened fibre cement sheeting, and timber boarded to chair rail height. Ceilings are either decorative plaster or battened fibre cement sheeting. The homestead features a number of full height two-light sash windows opening to the front verandah, a servery within the dining space and face brick fireplace surrounds. At the rear of the house is a later extension that houses a kitchen and meals area. ;Former laundry (mid 19th century) A small timber framed and weatherboard clad structure with gable roof of corrugated iron and concrete slab floor. A sandstock chimney remains at one end. The structure is being undermined by wombat burrows and an adjacent concrete BBQ is in danger of collapsing into the hut. ;Landscaping The location of the homestead is marked by a semi circle of mature radiata pines on the southern and western sides. Around the homestead is a small yard enclosed by a timber and star picket framed wire fence in fair condition. On the slopes in front of the homestead and yard are the remains of an overgrown orchard. Near to the school house is large mature gum tree, which would appear to have been cultivated at an early date. ;Slab shed (mid 19th century) The slab shed is a single roomed structure located at the rear of the homestead, probably dating from the mid 19th century. It has a simple round posts, top and bottom plates, with walls of split vertical slabs, which have been limewashed to both the exterior and interior. The floor is concrete slab, and the roof framing timbers are a mix of hand and machine sawn timbers. The gable roof is clad with corrugated iron sheeting, and the ceiling lined with bituminised builder's paper. ;Garage (late 19th century) A timber framed weatherboard clad building comprising two garage spaces. The building has a gable roof over the one garage and a skillion roof over the other. The floor of the building is a concrete slab. There is an early window at one end of the gable roofed structure. ;Staff cottage (-30s) A 1920s-30s cottage is located adjacent the garage. It has weatherboard walls with external brick chimney and corrugated gable iron roof. Rectangular in plan, the cottage contains 4 rooms and a bathroom within an enclosed verandah at one end. Windows are double hung sash dating from the period. Internally all finishes and fixtures from the period of construction remain, including battened fibre cement wall and ceiling linings and brick fireplace surround. ;Outbuildings A number of smaller outbuildings such as chicken sheds and yard of corrugated iron and timber bush poles, a former fibre cement slaughter house and fibre cement shed remain. ;Shearing shed and yards (from mid 19th century) The shearing shed and stables appears to have been constructed in a number of different stages, as evidenced by the mix of gable and skillion roof forms. The original extent of the shearing shed was comparatively quite small, and appears to have occupied the area of the bins. In this area are the remains of hand squared posts, timber slab walls with metal cover strips. Later extensions are of round bush pole construction, with sawn timber roof framing and suspended timber floors, including the area of pens and yards on the southern side. Externally the whole complex is clad with corrugated iron sheeting to roofs and walls, with the exception of one external wall, which is clad with timber slabs. The shearing machinery and the interiors of the shearing shed are intact. The shearing shed adjoins stables which are later, which have a bush pole construction and pens constructed of half logs. On the eastern side of the shearing shed are yards of timber post and rail construction, which are partially dilapidated and have been reinforced with corrugated iron sheeting. ;School house (mid-late 19th century) Located at the foot of the hill to the south of the homestead, the school house building is a small single-roomed timber slab structure, with partially enclosed leanto on one side. The gable roof and skillion leanto are clad with corrugated iron. The floors of the main room is composed of 6\\" timber planks fixed to round logs. There are the remains of a brick fireplace on one side, although the chimney has been removed. Internal walls and raked ceilings were once lined with bituminised builder's paper, however some has peeled away, exposing a limewash finish to the vertical slabs. There is one door remaining, which is a timber ledged and sheeted doors, with carpenter rim lock and diamond headed nails. The leanto is partially enclosed, and there is evidence of a timber slab wall on the northern side. There are the remains of a timber plank floor within the lean-to. The structure is in a fair condition, despite the partial collapse of the leanto enclosure and floors, and despite some undermining by wombats. = Condition = The condition of the homestead was reported as generally fair to poor and the outbuildings poor as at 28 June 2007. The homestead complex as a whole has a high degree of integrity. The property contains a complete set of 1870s to mid-twentieth century buildings in relatively good condition including: main house, laundry, stables, shearing shed and yards, staff accommodation, storage sheds. The main house has a high degree of integrity although sections of it require urgent maintenance. The house retains almost all of its original early twentieth century features including internal joinery, fixtures and layout with few modern additions. The original 1870s laundry remains structurally intact although it is being seriously undermined by wombats. The shearing shed and stables complex retains an exceptional degree of integrity and retains its overhead shearing frame and timber skirting table. The former school building retains a high degree of integrity but is in poor condition in parts reducing its level of intactness. All features of the Limekilns Creek race and sluicing complex were intact when McGowan surveyed the site in the 1990s.  Heritage listing  Virginia has State significance as one of the earliest land grants and settlements in the Shoalhaven River area, that is able to demonstrate patterns of land allocation and use in southern NSW over three distinct phases of development from the mid 19th, late 19th and early 20th centuries. The various structures at the property are tangible evidence of these three phases of settlement and farming activities. The strong visual grouping of the homestead, outbuildings, school house, shearing shed complex and mature landscaping has Regional significance as a historic rural setting that is able to evoke 19th and early 20th century pastoral activity in the region, that has remained largely intact since this time. The site has some association with the Roberts family, early settlers in the district, and although not assessed is likely to have social significance for descendants of the Roberts family. The structures at Virginia are good representative examples of rural vernacular construction techniques from the mid 19th to early 20th century. The school house is a rare example of such a use in the Braidwood area that has the ability to provide information about early education facilities on rural properties that is not available in documentary sources. The Limekilns Creek sluicing site has heritage significance as possibly one of the largest hydraulic sluicing complexes on the Shoalhaven River, which together with the associated engineering works, presents tangible evidence of the major alluvial mining activity centred on this part of the Shoalhaven River in the 1870s. Virginia was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Virginia has State heritage significance under this criterion. Established in 1836, it was one of the earlier land grants in the Parish of Larbert. The Limekilns Creek sluicing site has Local heritage significance under this criterion. The site may be associated with Chinese miners, who were active in the region in the 1870s. It was probably the largest hydraulic sluicing complex on the Shoalhaven and together with the associated engineering works the site presents tangible evidence of the major alluvial mining activity centred on this part of the Shoalhaven in the 1870s. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Virginia has Local heritage significance under this criterion. The site is associated with the Roberts family, who were significant early settlers in the Braidwood region and are still a well known family in the region today. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Virginia has State heritage significance under this criterion. The homestead commands impressive views over the alluvial flats of the Shoalhaven River around Connie's Creek. The strong visual grouping of the homestead, outbuildings, school house, shearing shed complex and mature conifers creates a significant pastoral landscape. Its isolation has protected the historic setting of the group and the ability of the place to demonstrate and evoke nineteenth century and early twentieth century pastoral activity in the region. As a grouping of rural farming structures, the homestead, its outbuildings, the school house and the shearing shed are significant for their ability to demonstrate the phases of development and use of the property since the mid 19th century to the early decades of the 20th century. While the split timber slab school house has technical significance as a good representative example of such construction from the mid 19th century, it is a rare example of its type (use) that has the ability to provide information about early education facilities on rural properties that is not available in documentary sources. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The social significance of Virginia has not been formally assessed through community consultation. It appears to have some significance to the local historical society as an early property in the district, which is associated with the Roberts family, one of the significant early families in the district. It may have Local heritage significance for this reason. It is likely to have significance for the Roberts family and other former tenants, but this attachment does not meet the thresholds for significance under this particular criterion. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Virginia has Local heritage significance under this criterion. Archaeological remains and artefact deposits from the 1840s and 1870s homesteads have the potential to add to knowledge about the development of Virginia Waters and changing lifestyles in a large rural holding in southern NSW throughout the nineteenth century. The Limekilns Creek sluicing site has Local Heritage significance under this criterion. They contain evidence associated with the major alluvial mining activity that occurred around the Shoalhaven in the 1870s. Along with other mining sites in the district, the Limekilns Creek site has the potential to provide information about life and technology on the goldfields that is not available from other sources. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Virginia has State heritage significance under this criterion. The grouping of structures contains evidence of each of the 3 phases of development at the property, from the early to mid decades of the nineteenth century (archaeological remains, school house, shearing shed, former laundry and slab shed), later decades of the 19th century (garage, extension to shearing shed and archaeological ruins of 1870s cottage) and early decades of the 20th century (homestead and staff quarters). While the timber slab school house utilises construction techniques that are typical of the mid 19th century, it is a rare example of such a structure of this use, that has the ability to provide information about early education facilities on rural properties at this time that is not available in documentary sources. The Limekilns Creek sluicing site has Local Heritage significance under this criterion. It forms part of the wider Shoalhaven River goldfields and one of a number of significant sites in the region. It is however possibly the largest mechanical sluicing site on the Shoalhaven. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Virginia has State heritage significance under this criterion as a grouping of structures that are good representative examples of rural vernacular construction techniques from the mid 19th to early 20th century.

It was built from 1859 to 1860. The property is owned by the Anglican Church Property Trust. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  = Original church = Alberto Dies Soares, Anglican Minister to Queanbeyan from 1857 to 1877, was born on 26 November 1830, the fifth child of His Excellency, Manoel Joachim Soares, Knight Commander of the Cross of Christ in Portugal, and Camilla Mary Basset Lodington. His father was Portuguese and his mother English. Alberto Dies Soares received a sound education at Stoke, Newington, Mercantile & London University schools. He studied in Porto, Portugal and at the Putney College of Civil Engineers before finishing in Paris, France. In 1852, Soares sailed for Australia where he had an appointment with the New South Wales Government Railways as an engineer. En route he decided not to take up his position but to study for the ministry instead. Following three years of study he became an ordained Minister of the Church of England and was appointed to Collector as Assistant to the Rev. Robert Cartwright in 1855. The following year be became Deacon at Collector. In 1857 Soares married Catherine Lane of Orton Park, Bathurst and on 18 May of that year he was transferred to Queanbeyan as the Parish Priest. Christ Church in those days was a small building, measuring a mere . It had been opened for worship on Christmas Day 1844 on the same site where Christ Church now stands; it was not consecrated however, until the Bishop of Australia, Bishop William Broughton, officiated at the ceremony on 8 March 1845, just four days before he consecrated the Church of St John the Baptist, Canberra. A rather insignificant street, Broughton Place, in Queanbeyan, commemorated the Bishop's visit. A report in the Goulburn Herald of 14 September 1859, stated that the old Church of England, Queanbeyan, had been razed to the ground and that a new building was rapidly being erected. Soares, an accomplished architect, set about to design a new church. = Current church = The Rev. Soares, whilst preparing the design and drawings, constructed a small scale model of his church-to-be. Although without its spire, the opening service at the new Christ church was held on 7 October 1860, with the sum of A¬£860 still owing. The Golden Age of 15 September 1860 stated that the opening service took place at 11 am on Sunday 7 October. The same paper of 13 October 1860, indicated that Rev. A. D. Soares preached from Zachariah 4:6, whilst at the evening services, the Rev. P. G. Smith from Canberra, read from Corinthians 6:16. The sum of A¬£43 was collected at the opening services. On 2 March 1861 the spire was completed by the contractors, McLean and Ross at a cost of A¬£336. The new church was finally consecrated by Frederic Barker, the Bishop of Sydney on 30 October 1861. The contract to build the church was granted to Daniel Jordan. His son Thomas Jordan made the pews. The cost of the church was A¬£4,300, whilst subscriptions and donations totalled A¬£4,498. During the month of the opening, tiers of stepping stones, each weighing from 10 to 15 cwt, were laid across the river from the foot of Rutledge Street to where the Severne Flour Mill once stood, thus giving access to residents of Dodsworth and Irish Town to Christ Church School which had been built in 1843. The Rev. Soares met the cost of these stepping stones which were obtained from a source some three miles away and laid by Mr M O'Keefe. Soares' other architectural achievement following his arrival in Queanbeyan was the beautiful Victorian Ecclesiastical Gothic of St Philip's at Bungendore; its foundation stone was laid in 1864. Next followed St Paul's at Burra which resulted from the initiative of Soares' brother, the Rev. Gualter Soares, who was a catechist and a schoolmaster at the Christ Church schoolhouse; St Paul's foundation stone was laid on 12 December 1867. After designing St Mark's at Hoskinstown, in 1872 he designed the chancery and extensions to the nave in the church of St John the Baptist, Canberra. He then proceeded with St Stephen's Presbyterian Church, Queanbeyan, (1872); St. Thomas', Carwoola.Molonglo 1874 Next followed the Protestant Hall in Crawford Street which was opened in May 1877. Soares also re-designed the Queanbeyan Rectory and in 1865 was responsible for the brick addition to the old stone schoolhouse which still stands. In 1877, after 20 years ministering in the Queanbeyan parish, Soares was transferred to Goulburn Cathedral and later became the Diocesan Architect. He was responsible for more than 35 churches, schools and parsonages in the Anglican Diocese of Goulburn. Soares and his wife had five children, three girls and two boys. His first son Alberto died in 1860 as an infant and is buried in the Riverside Cemetery; his second son, also named Alberto, died at the age of 25 with no issue. Soares' father died in London in 1863 at the age of 37 and a brother Augusto died at the same time in London, aged 4. Soares died in 1909 at the age of 79 and is buried in the Waverley Cemetery. =Subsequent developments= In January 1978, vandals tried to burn down the church, but only the vestry door and a portion of the floor were destroyed. In 1978 the Heritage Branch was advised by the Queanbeyan and District Historical Museum Society that a building application had been approved by Queanbeyan Council for the construction of a large and unsympathetic church hall on part of the site of Christ Church. The construction would involve the demolition of the original school and church buildings. To enable guidance for the erection of a more sympathetically designed hall and control over the restoration of the school houses and stables, an Interim Conservation Order was made over the property on 24 November 1978. The placement of the order halted the development plans. A Permanent Conservation Order was placed over the property on 11 February 1983. In 1997, the church received heritage approval to install a pair of pictorial stained glass windows, replacing a pair of lead-lighted cathedral glass windows in the central north side. In 1991 through the Heritage Assistance program a matched grant was provided to assist in the replacement of part of the floor of the church and electrical re-wiring. The PCO listing was transferred to the State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  Description  The Christ Church Group consists of: # a fine Gothic Revival Church # a rectory, # stable and # school houses. The precinct covers an area of about and is a picturesque landmark in Queanbeyan. The Church is a fine example of a Gothic Revival church. It has a cruciform plan with a tower and broached spire at the west end. The walls are of rock faced random stone with dressed quoins and window surrounds. A shingle roof was replaced by iron about 1890. This church was built to replace the earlier one now used as a Sunday School. The original church building is a simple, small building of stone rubble construction with a gabled iron roof. It was consecrated in 1845 and is reported to be the oldest known building in Queanbeyan.  Heritage listing  The Church is an important landmark within a group of public buildings in the centre of Queanbeyan. It represents a consolidation of the city centre and of the Anglican faith in the region.

In 2017 it was designated to the National Register of Historic Places as an example of an intact early 20th-century reinforced concrete factory complex. It is located at 94-15 100th street, between 94th and 95th Avenues one block from Atlantic Ave in the Woodhaven neighborhood of Queens, New York City, and is best known as the location of the Worksman Cycles Factory, a manufacturer of iconic pushcarts, tricycles and heavy duty bicycles. The building was listed on the New York State Register of Historic Places in 2017. Original use The Regal Hat company of Chicago and the Spear Company of New York merged on May 1, 1920, to be known as the Regal-Spear Co., manufacturers of cloth headwear and children's novelties. The Spear company experienced labor unrest later in 1920 when the labor force was locked out of the Woodhaven factory in Ozone Park, Queens. At the time the company was listed as serving 22,000 customers. The factory building on 100 St., was once home to Regal-Spear Co., which produced hats and was touted as the largest cloth headwear house in the world. It was also home to the Columbia Wax Products Co., a manufacturer of novelty candles. It was later home to the Worksman bicycle manufacturer. Constructed in 1906 for Spear & Company, was one of the first cast-in-place concrete structures in New York City. Present left A report prepared by Gregory Dietrich Preservation Consulting, a landmark preservation group, described the building's architecture and stated its historical value qualified it for historic registry status. The report concluded, \\"The Spear & Company factory is not only significant for embodying the practical benefits of reinforced- concrete factory construction, but also for its simplicity and utility as exhibited by a restrained eclectic utilitarian design.\\" The designation, which is largely honorific, will help ensure the former Hat factory's long-term preservation. The status also makes property owners eligible for tax credits to rehabilitate the structures.http://www.qchron.com/editions/south/is-this- ozone-park-factory-historic/article_0505934d-65e6-5e40-b86c-8dea70183ef1.html State Rehabilitation Tax Credits in New York, Connecticut, Delaware and Maryland offer state tax credits as an added incentive for rehabilitating National Register listed properties. In New York State, for example, owners of commercial properties or owner-occupied residential properties listed on the National Register that are located in eligible census tracts have the potential to capture 20% after-tax credits for qualified rehabilitative expenses related to their property's redevelopment.https://parks.ny.gov/shpo/tax-credit- programs/documents/NYSTaxCreditPrograms.pdf right Andrew Cuomo, New York state governor designated the site eligible for historical status in 2017 along with 20 others, announcing ‚ÄúThe Empire State proudly celebrates its diverse culture and rich heritage, and with the addition of these significant sites to the Registers of Historic Places, we will continue to honor all of the great things that make New York, New York,‚Äù The statement had designated 21 sites around New York state. ‚ÄúListing these landmarks will honor the contributions made by so many New Yorkers throughout our vast history, and helps advance efforts to preserve and improve these important historic sites for future generations.‚Äù The city Economic Development Corp. announced in 2016 the site will be rehabilitated to accommodate 24 businesses and 80 skilled workers due to a $10 million grant and $3.7 million loan from the EDC.

Her work often focuses on themes of familial relationships and nature, and it is included in several permanent collections of major museums across the United States. In 2018, she stepped forward as the founder and funder of the Anonymous Was A Woman Award. Life Unterberg was born in 1941 in New York City, New York, USA. In an interview, Unterberg stated that, during her childhood, she hadn't been \\"encouraged to become an artist or generally to have career ambitions, [...] It was a time when women got their names in the paper when they got married or died.\\" Despite this, Unterberg pursued her art education when her two daughters were \\"school-aged.\\" She graduated from Sarah Lawrence College with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1977 and received a Master of Arts from New York University in 1985. Unterberg has received various fellowships, including from the New York Foundation for the Arts in 1992 and the MacDowell Colony in 1995. In 1996, she was named a visiting artist at the American Academy in Rome. Once a guest artist at the artist colony Yaddo, Unterberg was named as its co-chairwoman with A. M. Homes in 2013. She credited Yaddo as a place where she had worked and grown as an artist. Unterberg lives in New York City. Work Unterberg usually separates her work by subject into discrete series. Her earlier work includes emotional portraits of familial relationships that explore the psychological bonds and connections between family members, while her later work consists of more abstract landscapes and portraits of animals which emphasize light, color, and metaphor. Unterberg is known for her diptych studies Mothers and Daughters and Fathers and Sons, which photographically explore family relationships. As of 2018, Unterberg's projects involve layering photographic work in Adobe Photoshop, which she describes as \\"self-portraits that deal with the [current American] political situation.\\" Unterberg's photographic work has been exhibited at the New Museum of Contemporary Art, the International Center of Photography, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Jewish Museum, New York and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Collections Unterberg's work is included in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, the Metropolitan Museum of Art,https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/282513 the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Jewish Museum, New York, and the Nelson-Adkins Museum of Art. Philanthropy In July 2018, Unterberg revealed herself as the founder and sole funder of the Anonymous Was A Woman Award. Between 1996 and 2018, she had secretly contributed $5.5 million to the fund, which was then awarded to 220 underrecognized female artists over the age of 40. This award is \\"an unrestricted grant of $25,000 awarded each year to ten women artists\\" who have reached a critical point in their careers. Before 2018, she had remained anonymous so that her artwork would be evaluated in its own context, without being influenced by her contributions. In an interview, she described her reasons for coming forward, stating \\"It‚Äôs a great time for women to speak up. I feel I can be a better advocate having my own voice,\\" and that she can now work openly to further the organization's cause and to encourage philanthropists and women artists. On top of the grant award program, Unterberg is considering other forms of programs, possibly seminars, to add balance to the organization.

History  In the early 1880s Calhoun County was one of two counties in the state without a local paper. The Chronicle filled that gap with a democratic weekly. By 1898 the Weekly Register counted it as one of the best papers to come to their office. In 1900, founder S. C. Barr announced that though the paper was Democratic, it would not be endorsing the Democratic nominee for U.S. president, William Jennings Bryan, citing the failure of the disasters Bryan had predicted in 1896 to appear: > \\"A rule of law is where a witness is impeached, or is overtaken In false > statements; that his evidence Is not entitled to the same degree of > credibility as it was before.

The film stars Gina Rodriguez, Ismael Cruz C√≥rdova, and Anthony Mackie, and follows a woman who trains to take down a Mexican drug cartel after her friend is kidnapped. The film was released in the United States on February 1, 2019, by Columbia Pictures, in Dolby Cinema, and grossed over $15 million on a $15 million budget making it an average grosser. While Rodriguez's performance received some praise, critics compared the film unfavorably to the original, saying it suffered from \\"bland action and predictable story beats\\". Plot Gloria Fuentes is a Latin-American makeup artist from Los Angeles who goes on a trip to visit her best friend Suzu in Tijuana, Mexico. When the pair go to a local night club, Suzu plans to impress the Mexican Chief of Police, Saucedo, in order to help her chances in the Miss Baja California beauty pageant which she has entered. When Gloria goes to the bathroom, armed gunmen break in through the vents and attempt to kidnap Gloria out of her stall but ultimately give her time to escape while they attack the club. Chaos ensues as Gloria is separated from Suzu. The next morning, Gloria is unable to get in contact with Suzu and decides to ride with a police officer to try to find Suzu. She informs the police officer that she has information on the men who attacked the club, and the officer asks her to follow him to the station. When the officer takes a break in a remote location, Gloria is taken by members of the Los Estrellas gang, the same men who shot up the club. The gang take her to their headquarters, where Lino, the gang leader, agrees to help her find Suzu if she agrees to work for them. Gloria is reluctant but eventually agrees as she does not have much choice, and is told to get into a car and park it on a corner of a building. Gloria does the job, and when she leaves the car and joins the men at the top of a hill overlooking the building, they blow up the building, revealed to be a DEA safehouse containing three agents. Lino then sends Gloria to the Miss Baja pageant, where she attempts an escape through the bathroom. Gloria escapes and encounters a DEA agent, Brian Reich, who takes her into custody and eventually lets her go but not before he puts a tracking device on her since the DEA are aiming to monitor Los Estrellas. Gloria returns to Suzu's apartment and finds Lino there, and is sent to San Diego with blood money and drugs attached to her car. Upon crossing the border Gloria is given an arsenal of guns to bring back to Mexico by a gangster named Jimmy, and then told to meet in a large parking lot. Gloria then informs Brian about the meet-up at the parking lot, where he promises to send a SWAT team to rescue her during the mission to capture Lino and the Los Estrellas gang. As Gloria arrives at the parking lot, the men in Los Estrellas get their weapons. However the police show up under Brian's command, causing a gunfight to ensue in the lot. Gloria runs to a nearby gate where Brian promised to send the SWAT team to pick her up, but upon seeing nobody there she realizes that Brian's only goal was to capture Los Estrellas, and that he had no intention of helping her. Seeing Gloria stranded in the middle of the gunfight, Lino runs to Gloria to save her, but is shot in the leg. After a moment of hesitation, Gloria decides to help Lino and together, they escape with the other members of Los Estrellas. The gang head to another safe house, where Gloria meets a woman named Isabella. Isabella herself was threatened into joining Los Estrellas, and bears an infigurative tattoo, meaning she belongs to them. When Gloria hears that they will be checking phones to find a mole in the group, she transfers the chip that Brian gave her to another phone. Lino brings Gloria on a ride to meet some family, and they spend time together as Lino shares his dream of living a simple life in the countryside despite his involvement in a gang. As they return to the safe house, the gang informs Lino that they have found the mole. Unknowingly and to her dismay, Gloria had put the chip in the phone belonging to Isabella, who is killed by Lino for being the suspected mole. Gloria is extremely upset, and the next morning she lashes out at Lino. Lino explains his plan to kill The Mexican Chief of Police, Saucedo, to Gloria, and shows her a video of Suzu being auctioned off to various buyers. He explains that Suzu was taken the night of the club shooting, and is sold as an escort every night. His plan is to send Gloria to the Miss Baja pageant and ensure her victory by bribing the judges, after which she will be invited to the afterparty organized by Saucedo. Gloria participates in the pageant and wins, and is then invited to the afterparty at Saucedo's beach home. At the party, she agrees to meet with Saucedo in one of the villas, which she informs Lino of the whereabouts via an in-ear microphone. Before meeting Saucedo, Gloria sees Suzu, and they reunite, Gloria telling Suzu that everything will be okay. However, when Suzu shows her a tattoo on her hand, the same tattoo that Isabella had, Gloria quickly realizes that Lino deceived her and that he had known where Suzu was the whole time. As Gloria follows Saucedo into the villa, she writes on a postcard that Lino is going to kill him. Saucedo quickly escapes outside just as Los Estrellas begin their attack, and Gloria goes to find Suzu armed with a gun from one of the fallen Los Estrellas gang members. As Gloria goes to find Suzu, she is forced to shoot Saucedo in the leg after he tries to hold Suzu hostage, but then Lino kills him and thanks Gloria for her help in killing Saucedo. Gloria points her gun at Lino, confessing she knows that he was aware of Suzu's whereabouts. Lino tries to bargain with Gloria telling her that they both did what needed to be done, but she ends up shooting and killing him. The two women are soon arrested when the cops arrive at the party, and when Gloria is taken into an interrogation room, she finds Jimmy, the man she had received the weapons from in San Diego, and realizes that he is a CIA agent. Gloria has Jimmy free Suzu and herself, and she returns Suzu to her family and goes back into the car with Jimmy, driving off to join the CIA.

This form of shoulder replacement is utilized in situations in which conventional shoulder replacement surgery would lead to poor outcomes and high failure rates. Originally considered a salvage procedure, the combination of improved design features and excellent clinical outcome data has led to reverse shoulder replacement largely replacing shoulder hemiarthroplasty for most indications, and even challenging conventional anatomic shoulder replacement in many countries as the most commonly performed shoulder replacement procedure.  Medical uses  Historically, the primary indication to perform reverse shoulder replacement was cuff tear arthropathy, which consists of advanced glenohumeral arthritis in the presence of a massive rotator cuff tear. As reverse shoulder replacement has become more popular, the indications have expanded to include shoulder ‚Äúpseudoparalysis‚Äù due to massive rotator cuff tears, shoulder fractures, severe bone loss on the scapula or humerus precluding the use of standard implants and failed prior shoulder replacement procedures.  Surgical techniques  Pectoralis major muscle The procedure is performed through a deltopectoral approach, in which the space between the deltoid muscle and pectoralis major muscle is developed. The subscapularis muscle, one of the four muscles of the rotator cuff, is typically detached to perform the operation. The native humerus and scapula bones are prepared using precise machining to accommodate their respective implants. At the end of the procedure, the subscapularis muscle is typically repaired, although some surgeons advocate not repairing this muscle due to the excess tension placed on it by the altered mechanics of the reverse shoulder design. It is worth noting that this is an implant specific phenomenon, as certain reverse shoulder designs disrupt the normal anatomical relationships significantly while others attempt to restore these closer to what is considered normal anatomy. = Implants = Modern reverse shoulder implants consist of multiple parts. On the scapula bone, there is a metallic baseplate that grows into the bone of the native glenoid, screws and/or pegs that hold this in place, and a round metallic ‚Äúglenosphere‚Äù component that is mated to the baseplate via several different mechanisms. On the humerus bone, there is typically a concave polyethylene liner that articulates with the convex glenosphere and is attached to a humeral stem that grows into the native humerus or is cemented into place. Within this basic structure there are multiple different variations of implants, and to date there is no consensus on which design is superior, although several studies have demonstrated some benefits to certain combinations. One such modern reverse shoulder implant system is the AltiVate Reverse. More information on this system can be found on the DJO website. Plain film radiographs in anteroposterior (AP) view of left shoulders that are status post reverse shoulder arthroplasty using three design iterations each with a 135-degree neck-shaft angle and lateralized center of rotation.  History  Traditional shoulder replacement (known as anatomic shoulder replacement) was developed to treat glenohumeral arthritis and consists of resurfacing the native humeral head and glenoid to create smooth articular surfaces to provide pain relief and improved range of motion. Variations of this procedure have been performed as early as 1883. While most patients can achieve substantial clinical improvement using this approach, those with large rotator cuff tears have consistently demonstrated poor outcomes due to loss of the stability provided by these muscles. In 1972, U.S. orthopedic surgeon Charles S. Neer designed a fixed-fulcrum shoulder replacement in which he reversed the ball and socket geometry. Unfortunately, his design resulted in several early failures, leading him to abandon this concept. Multiple other surgeons throughout the world subsequently developed reversed ball and socket implants, and while some achieved reasonably good results, the concept never gained significant traction until French surgeon Paul Grammont developed his ‚ÄúTrompette‚Äù prosthesis in 1985. This was further modified into the Delta III prosthesis in 1991. As Grammont‚Äôs reverse ball and socket prosthesis gained popularity and began demonstrating reliable outcomes, he subsequently developed what would be known as the ‚ÄúGrammont Principles‚Äù, which were a set of rules that explained why his prosthesis was effective and why other reverse ball and socket designs failed. In 1998, U.S. orthopedic surgeon Mark Frankle began designing a reverse ball and socket prosthesis that did not adhere to the traditional Grammont Principles. He began patenting this device, the RSP (Reverse Shoulder Prosthesis), in 2002. Many doubted the effectiveness of his design and suggested that it would lead to higher failure rates, creating significant controversy and debate within the orthopedic community. After validating his theories with rigorous scientific studies and making several key modifications to his design, Frankle ultimately developed an implant that was able to address the shortcomings of the Grammont-style prostheses while also showing excellent survivorship. Multiple studies have since gone on to demonstrate the advantages of his design principles, and many of the modern generation reverse shoulder implants have mirrored them.

Lewinson and Hough were jointly awarded the 1918 Pulitzer Prize for their paper 'A History of the Services Rendered to the Public by the American Press During the Year 1917', described as \\"the best history of the services rendered to the public by the American press during the preceding year\\". The prize was worth $1,000, and the particular prize category ('Newspaper History') was only awarded the one time. Jury notes indicate that the prize was considered for awarding every year from the first ceremony in 1917 through to 1924, however the prize was removed from the rosters in 1925 still with only two recipients; Lewinson and Hough.  Career  Lewinson worked as a copy writer, as a reporter and columnist for Daily Investment News, and as a reporter for Women's Wear Daily. Lewinson was the first woman hired by the Wall Street Journal, in 1918, working as a copy editor. She left the newspaper in 1923, and no other women were hired by the journal for several more decades.

The high speed vessel carrying 112 passengers and crew sank off the coast of Bone, South Sulawesi in inclement weather conditions. A nine-day search and rescue operation, conducted by authorities, successfully rescued 45 survivors and recovered 65 bodies from the sea. Twelve people were declared missing and presumed dead. The sinking was the deadliest shipwreck of 2015 in Indonesia and one of the worst in South Sulawesi. Multiple survivors stated that rough waves managed to damage the ferry's hull and flooded the vessel. On 8 March 2018, the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee published the final report. They blamed bad weather as the main cause of the disaster, producing waves higher than the safe limit height for the ferry, which is . Due to this, a massive amount of water quickly flooded the ferry. Contributing to the disaster were design flaws in the ferry's structure and the poor handling of the emergency by the crew. Sinking The ferry, MV Marina Baru 2B, was used for regularly scheduled domestic ferry service from North Kolaka Regency, Southeast Sulawesi to Wajo Regency, South Sulawesi. The service usually took about three hours. The ferry had a capacity of 184 passengers and crew members. On 19 December 2015, at 11:00 local time (UTC+8), the ferry departed Kolaka Harbor. Video footage taken by onlookers during the departure showed that the weather at the time was in good condition. As the ferry passed Lambasina Island, the captain increased speed to around 20 knots. At approximately 12:30 local time, the ferry was in Bone Bay. 30 minutes later, the weather in the area started to deteriorate. Waves began to reach and the wind became intense. Windspeeds at the time was recorded to be around . The captain chose to continue to Siwa and to decrease the speed of the ferry by . The ferry was repeatedly hit by rough waves and high winds causing the ship to roll violently. The captain struggled to maintain the control of the ferry and asked the crew to be on alert and to prepare the passengers for an emergency. At 13:30 local time the crew heard a loud crack from the bow and the bulwark of the ferry started to separate. Moments later, the bulwark along with several objects on the forecastle deck broke free of the vessel. The Captain then ordered the crew to check on the lower decks and assessment the situation at the bow. The crew quickly realized that water had flooded the passenger area of the lower deck and that passengers had already begun to panic. Quick examination revealed that water was entering the ferry through the bow door and the side passenger door. There were arguments between the crew on whether they should return to Kolaka or continue on to Wajo. The captain finally decided to return to Kolaka. As he was struggling for the controls, large amounts of water continued to enter and the ferry began taking on a heavy list. Passengers recalled that the ferry reached an angle of approximately 30 degrees. Several passengers tried in vain to bail the water out by hand but were later overwhelmed by the amount of water. The ferry, overwhelmed by wind, waves and water egress was finally stop by the captain and the order given to an abandon ship. At 14:20 local time, a distress transmission was sent to ground officers stating that the ferry was sinking and asking for immediate assistance. This was the last transmission from the ferry. The crew recalled that as they were evacuating the passengers, they only managed to inflate one life raft, while the other four were unusable. As a result, many passengers jumped into the sea without life vests and were swept away by the rough waves. At 16:30 local time, approximately 3 hours after the start of the sinking, the ferry was completely submerged. Search and rescue The ground officers immediately contacted the Indonesian National Search and Rescue Agency at 14:20 local time. Multiple government agencies were also contacted. In response to the emergency, officials in Siwa Harbor dispatched MV Marina Express 3 to the area. However, due to the rough waves and windy condition in the area, officials postponed the rescue operation. The captain of the vessel decided to return to Tobakul/Lasusua. Officials later contacted the crew of MV New Camellia to observe the situation near the area where last contact had been made by MV Marina Baru 2B. However, the captain was unable to do so due to bad weather condition in the area. The search and rescue operation had to be called off by authorities due to the deteriorating weather condition. Members of the Kendari Search and Rescue Agency were briefed on the search and rescue operation The search and rescue operation was resumed on 20 December. Crisis center was set up in Siwa. Multiple ships and helicopter were dispatched to search survivors and victims. The Indonesian Armed Forces stated that they would participate in the rescue operation. On 06:00 local time the crew of MV Marina Express 3 managed to rescue 20 survivors. Two bodies were also recovered. Four survivors were later found by a local fisherman nearby. On 09:00 local time, a group of 14 survivors were rescued while a body was retrieved from the sea. The search and rescue operation was hampered by bad weather. During the operation, a search and rescue ship was damaged by rough waves. On 21 December, Indonesian Search and Rescue Agency shifted the search area to the waters in North Kolaka and Kolaka, as the sea current would likely drift the passengers to the area. Most survivors were found in the area. The head of the Indonesian National Search and Rescue Agency, Soelistyo, stated that he would observe the rescue effort and would visit the survivors and the relatives of the victims in the hospital. One survivor was found and was immediately evacuated to Djafar Harun Hospital. On the evening, authorities announced that 3 bodies, including 1 child and 1 infant, had been recovered and 70 people were still missing. On 22 December, the search area was widened to Palopo. At least 783 search and rescue personnel were dispatched. The Captain of the ferry was found to have survived the sinking. He claimed that initially he was with another five people. However, they were later separated due to the strong waves. Another survivor was found floating on debris. The rescue operation was called off due to high waves. Authorities announced that 4 bodies had been recovered. On 23 December, local fishermen recovered seven bodies in Bulu Puloe. Another nine dead bodies were recovered by search and rescue personnel. On 24 December, 36 bodies were found. From 25 ‚Äì 26 December, only one victim was recovered. Three victims were transported to Makassar for further identification. Authorities stated that 12 were still missing. The search and rescue effort was extended for three days. On 29 December 2015, the search and rescue operation was officially ended. 45 survivors were rescued, 65 bodies were recovered and 12 people were never found. Passengers and crews There were conflicting reports on the actual number of passengers and crews who boarded the ferry. Several media stated that around 118‚Äì125 people were on board. Officials later confirmed that there were 108 passengers and 4 crew on board. Among the dead were government officials from Konawe Regency, Southeast Sulawesi and Pinrang Regency, South Sulawesi. Investigation =High waves= Most survivors stated that MV Marina Baru 2B sank due to the enormous height of the waves, which were as high as five meters. Indonesian Meteorological Agency stated that they had warned the crews on the possibilities of high waves, with windspeed reaching as high as . They later added that officials who worked in the harbor where the ferry departed should've cancelled the trip. Examination on the radar data suggested that waves as high as might have been formed due to the storm system throughout Bone Bay. Interviews on the survivors confirmed that the waves managed to enter the ferry through the bow door and the side passenger door. The water then managed to travel to the engine compartment. The pumps, which were responsible for taking the water out from the ferry, were overwhelmed by the massive amount of water. The engine compartment was flooded and the engine was abruptly stopped. Sequence of the sinking of MV Marina Baru 2B (taken from the NTSC Final Report) The water then managed to move to the backup engine, which was located directly behind the main engine compartment. Water easily went through the door and flooded the backup engine. Both compartments were located at the back of the ferry, so the stern started to sink. The sinking of the stern caused more water to enter, which caused the last compartment, located behind the backup engine, to be flooded as well. As three compartments were flooded by water, the ferry was unable to float. =Design flaws= Testimonies gathered from the survivors revealed that water entered the ferry through the bow door. Additional testimonies were given by the crews, who claimed that before the sinking they heard a crack near the bridge. The investigation revealed that there was a divider in the structure of the bow. This divider was responsible to prevent any water from entering the passenger area. Nearby, there was an access door to the forecastle deck. Investigators noted that the seal and the locking mechanism on the door was poor. The force of the wave was propelled by the Captain's decision to move directly against the waves. Thus, the waves managed to tear open the access door, which was located on the forecastle deck of the ferry. The divider was proven to be not waterproof, and thus allowing water to enter to the passenger area. Investigation revealed that most doors on MV Marina Baru 2B were not waterproof. The doors should've been equipped with waterproof seals. Additionally, the investigation team found that there was a window in the engine compartment. The no-glass window was located at a close proximity with the waterline. Investigators noted that any opening were prohibited in the engine compartment. The ventilation on the engine compartment was also located at a near proximity with the waterline. During the sinking, MV Marina Baru 2B rolled several times. Investigators noted that there was a high chance that water managed to enter the ferry through the openings. =Crew error and poor maintenance= Interviews from the survivors revealed that the survivors had to take their own initiatives to save the sinking ferry. Survivors claimed that, instead of the crews, the passengers were the one who managed the emergency, such as removing water from the ferry. There was no crowd control during the sinking, thus panic was not contained. The investigation also noted that several life-rafts and life-jackets were unusable during the sinking. It was revealed that there was minimum maintenance and observation on the reliability of the life-saving equipment on board the ferry. Aftermath National Transportation Safety Committee issued 10 recommendations in response to the accident. The Ministry of Transportation stated that they would evaluate every ferry services in Kolaka. Jasa Raharja stated that they would compensate the victims and the survivors of the disaster.

Directed by Chris Sanders, in his live-action directorial debut, and his first film without a co-director, the film was written by Michael Green, and stars Harrison Ford, Dan Stevens, Omar Sy, Karen Gillan, Bradley Whitford, and Colin Woodell. Set during the 1890s Klondike Gold Rush, the film follows a dog named Buck as he is stolen from his home in California and sent to the Yukon, where he befriends an old outdoorsman and begins a life-altering adventure. The Call of the Wild was released in the United States on February 21, 2020, by 20th Century Studios. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Ford's performance and the \\"entertaining action and earnest tone\\" but criticized the \\"uncanny\\" CGI of the animals. It was a box-office bomb, grossing $107 million against a production budget of $125‚Äì150 million, and lost the studio an estimated $50‚Äì100 million.  Plot  During the late 19th century, Buck, a large, gentle St. Bernard/Scotch Collie, lives contentedly with his master, Judge Miller, in Santa Clara, California. One night, Buck is abducted and shipped to the Yukon aboard a freighter. During the voyage, a crew member beats him as a means of discipline. After arriving, Buck returns a dropped harmonica to a man named John Thornton, moments before being sold to Perrault and his assistant Francoise for their dog sled to deliver mail across the Yukon. Perrault hopes that with Buck, he can make the long trek to the mail depot before the deadline. Buck is introduced to the other dogs, including the vicious pack leader, a husky named Spitz. Throughout their travels, Buck gains the loyalty and trust of Perrault, Francoise and the other sled dogs, after proving himself along the way and even rescuing Francoise, antagonizing Spitz. Buck begins experiencing ancestral spiritual visions of a black wolf that acts as his guide throughout their travels. One night, Buck catches then releases a rabbit. Spitz kills it before attacking Buck to assert his dominance. Spitz seems to win, until the rest of the pack encourage Buck. Buck pins Spitz down, displacing him as pack leader; Spitz then disappears into the wild. Perrault grudgingly makes Buck the lead when no other dog assumes the position. Buck's speed and strength allow the sled to arrive with the mail on time. There, Thornton hands over a letter he has written to his former wife expressing his feelings about their dead son. When Perrault returns, he learns the mail route is being replaced by the telegraph, forcing him to sell the dogs. Hal, a mean-spirited and inexperienced gold prospector, buys the pack and gradually works them to exhaustion carrying a heavy load in weather unsuitable for sledding. The exhausted dogs stop to rest before Hal can force them to cross an unstable frozen lake. When Buck refuses to move, Hal threatens to shoot him. Thornton appears and rescues Buck while Hal forces the other sled dogs to cross the lake. Under Thornton's care, Buck recovers. Later, at a saloon, Thornton is attacked by Hal, who reveals the dogs managed to run off leaving him with nothing. Witnessing the scene, Buck attacks Hal who is subsequently thrown out. Buck and Thornton then travel beyond the Yukon map where they can freely live in the wild. They come across an abandoned cabin in an open valley and settle in. Meanwhile, Hal relentlessly hunts them, believing Thornton is hiding gold. In the open wilderness, Thornton and Buck bond over their daily activities, primarily fishing and gold panning. Throughout their time together, Buck is drawn to a female white wolf. Going back and forth between Thornton and the white wolf, Buck is conflicted by his domesticated life with Thornton and his place with the wolf pack that the female belongs to. Thornton believes it is time to return home and tells Buck he is leaving in the morning, and to come and say good-bye. Buck heads into the forest and sleeps beside the white wolf, clearly conflicted. Hal subsequently finds and shoots Thornton. Buck returns and kills Hal by pushing him into the cabin, which has caught on fire. Thornton wants Buck to live for himself. He reassures him with his final words, \\"It's okay, boy. You're home.\\" The next morning, Buck returns to the wilderness. There, he mates and has offspring with the white wolf and becomes the pack leader, fully embracing the call of the wild.

Production  In October 2017, it was announced that 20th Century Fox was developing a new film adaptation of Jack London's 1903 novel The Call of the Wild, set in the Yukon during the 1890s Klondike Gold Rush. The film was set to be directed by Chris Sanders from a script by Michael Green, and produced by Erwin Stoff. In July 2018, Harrison Ford and Dan Stevens were cast in the film, with Ford starring as John Thornton, who goes on the search for gold. In August 2018, Colin Woodell joined the cast. In September, Omar Sy and Karen Gillan were added, while Bradley Whitford came aboard in October, and Cara Gee joined in November. Principal photography on the film began in late September 2018 in Los Angeles. The film was not shot on location, as extensive use was made of CGI, with some scenes also being filmed on sets in Los Angeles and exteriors in Santa Clarita, California. All in all, the production spent $109 million filming in California, with the final budget reaching $125‚Äì150 million by the time post-production wrapped. The visual effects were provided by Moving Picture Company (MPC), led by MPC‚Äôs studio in Montreal, with Erik Nash serving as vfx supervisor, and also by Soho VFX and Technoprops. The production team used computer animation to create a realistic version of the dog 'Buck'.  Music  Original Motion Picture Soundtrack Album In January 2019, it was announced that John Powell would compose the film's score. Powell previously collaborated with Sanders on the 2010 DreamWorks Animation film How to Train Your Dragon. Recording primarily took place in Los Angeles at the Newman Scoring Stage, with Powell conducting a 90-piece orchestra, as well as employing a 60-voice choir for the score. Joining him were regular composers Batu Sener and Paul Mounsey, who provided additional music. The soundtrack was released digitally on February 21, 2020, by Hollywood Records. All music was composed and conducted by John Powell. Piano Solos Album In October, 2020, John Powell announced on his Instagram account that he's releasing \\"Piano Solos from The Call of the Wild.\\" The album features ten tracks from John Powell's original score that were newly arranged and are performed by Batu Sener, who provided additional music to The Call of the Wild and collaborated with Powell on numerous other scores. The arrangements from this album are printed and distributed by Hal Leonard Publishing Company. The album was released by 5 Cat Studios, which is the record label owned by John Powell. This is the second 'piano solos' album from John Powell and Batu Sener, first one being \\"Piano Solos from How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World\\" released in May 2020.  Release  The film was originally set to be released on December 25, 2019, but was pushed back to February 21, 2020, following the acquisition of Fox by Disney, to accommodate the December releases of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Spies in Disguise. The Call of the Wild was also the first film released by 20th Century Studios, following its rebranding from 20th Century Fox by its parent Walt Disney Studios division. Coincidentally, the 1935 adaptation of the novel was the last film released under the Twentieth Century Pictures name before it merged with Fox Film to form 20th Century Fox. The Call of The Wild was released digitally on the night of March 27, 2020. The announcement followed Disney's earlier-than-planned releases of Frozen II and Onward on digital, due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in the closing of most theatres around the world. The film was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and Ultra HD Blu-ray on May 12, 2020 by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment. Reception =Box office= The Call of the Wild grossed $62.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $45.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $107.6 million. Its high production and marketing costs mean the film needed to gross $250‚Äì275 million in order to break even; various publications estimate it will lose the studio between $50‚Äì100 million. In the United States and Canada, the film was released alongside Brahms: The Boy II, and was projected to gross $15‚Äì20 million from 3,752 theaters in its opening weekend. The film made $8 million on its first day, including $1 million from Thursday night previews. It went on to overperform, debuting to $24.8 million and finishing second, behind holdover Sonic the Hedgehog; however, Deadline Hollywood wrote that \\"despite the over-indexing of Call of the Wild stateside, it's a hollow victory, given how much the film cost\\". The film made $13.2 million in its second weekend and $7 million on its third weekend, respectively finishing third and fifth. =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 62% based on 196 reviews, with an average rating of 6.02/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"It's undermined by distracting and unnecessary CGI, but this heartwarming Call of the Wild remains a classic story, affectionately retold.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 47 out of 100, based on 43 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews.\\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A‚Äì\\" on an A+ to F scale, and PostTrak reported it received an average 4 out of 5 stars, with 59% of people surveyed saying they would definitely recommend it. Owen Gleiberman of Variety praised Harrison Ford's performance, saying that he \\"acts with pure soul here (he also narrates the film with his lovely storybook growl); it's a minimalist performance, mostly very reactive, but the saintly gruffness of Ford‚Äôs thick-gray-bearded, sad- eyed presence helps to nudge Buck to life as a character.\\"  References   External links  Category:American films Category:2020 adventure films Category:2020s adventure films Category:American adventure films Category:English-language films Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:20th Century Studios films Category:3 Arts Entertainment films Category:Films set in Yukon Category:Films set in the 1890s Category:Motion capture in film Category:Films directed by Chris Sanders Category:Klondike Gold Rush in fiction Category:Films based on The Call of the Wild Category:Films with live action and animation Category:Films with screenplays by Michael Green (writer) Category:Films about dogs Category:Films scored by John Powell ","title":"The Call of the Wild (2020 film)"},{"id":"57963363","text":"Don Odle (May 12, 1920 ‚Äì March 7, 2002) was American football and basketball player and coach.

The total length is about , of which pass through the Magadan Region, and about through Chukotka. Features The road has the lowest technical category, without asphalt. The roadway will be treated with binder additives, which increase the resistance of the upper layer. The width of the single-lane roadway is , with passing areas. The roadsides are equipped with snow protection fences, signal posts and road signs. The maximum speed is limited to . Construction The whole route passes through a territory bounded by permafrost, therefore, the laying of the roadbed is done without disrupting the integrity of the moss-vegetation layer of the tundra, which is a good heat insulator that does not allow defrosting of the upper layer of permafrost, which can lead to the destruction of the road. In the marshy areas, geotextiles and geogrids are also used; the slopes of the embankment and the culverts are strengthened by multicellular mattresses. Aggregate for the roadbed is mined in roadside quarries, while in some places drilling and blasting are necessary. Engineering materials are imported during the period of summer navigation from the central regions of the country. Due to extreme climatic conditions, construction is suspended in summer during heavy rains, in winter in cases of particularly low air temperature and severe snowstorms.

The total construction budget in 2012 prices is about 150 billion rubles. For comparison, the cost of an annual northern delivery to the territory of Chukotka is estimated at 3 billion rubles (excluding storage).  Criticism  There are opinions that the implementation of the project will be extremely inefficient due to the enormous financial costs and technological complexity of this project. Due to the long distances and low road quality, passenger travel will still use aircraft most of the time. There is also a very low amount of motorization in the region (5 times less than Moscow). The savings in freight cost (even measured over multiple decades) will be less than the road construction cost.

It is headquartered in Bielefeld, Germany. The firm is a result of a merger in 1990 between Koch Adler Nahmaschinenwerke and Durkoppwerke. It has operations in nearly 10 countries and has 11 subsidiaries. The firm's equity is largely controlled by ShangGong Company of China. History The firm has a history of automobile, ball bearings and motorcycle production but both Kochs Adler and Durkopp's history began with sewing machines. Durkoppwerke's history began in 1867 when Heinrich Durkopp, who had earlier completed building a sewing machine on his own co-founded Durkopp and Schmidt with a colleague, Carl Schmidt. The firm later dropped Schmidt from its name. Operating out of the backroom of a clock-maker's factory, the new firm made both household and industrial sewing machines. As the business profile became enhanced among local customers, the firm moved to a new building close to market street, Bielefeld in 1870. The company expanded sales to other regions in Germany and introduced specialized machines for shoe-making. In 1885, it began production of bicycles and ball bearings which were an early success. During its early period, Durkopp experimented with many mechanical ideas and products, led by its founder, the firm began automobile production introducing a successful product, Knipperdolling to the market in 1906. The firm has produced three wheeled and two wheeled motorcycles. After World War I, the firm's debt profile grew and fell under the receivership of banks who went on to sell its automobile unit to Mercedes Benz. During the Second World War, the firm produced cylindrical bearings for tanks and weapons. Those products were jettisoned after the war and the firm went back to its core products, making sewing machines, conveyor belts, bicycles and motorcycles. By the 1962, the firm concentrated on making sewing machines and conveyor belts for the garment industry. In 1990, it merged with Koch Adler, another Bielefeld based industrial sewing machine manufacturer that was founded in 1860.

Gi·∫£ng and his 10,000 soldiers defeated the Siamese army in Cambodia, and installed Ang Chan II as a client king of Cambodia. Gi·∫£ng was appointed Governor-General of Cambodia and stayed in Phnom Penh to watch the king. In 1835 Ang Chan II died without heir. Gi·∫£ng installed Ang Mey as a client queen.

In 1719, she joined the Paris Opera's chorus, and after 1723 she sang many leading and titular roles throughout a career noted for sudden and unpredictable retirements until her final retirement in 1744.  Early life and career  Lemaure was born in Paris, France, on 3 August 1704. In 1719, she joined the chorus of the Acad√©mie Royale de Musique, more commonly known as the Paris Opera. Her opera debut was in December 1721, in the role of Astrea in Pha√´ton, an opera by Jean-Baptiste Lully, and she was promoted to role of Libya in January.Harold Rosenthal et John Warrack, Guide de l'op√©ra, Fayard 1986 By 1723, she began to take lead roles, such as Hippodamie in Piritho√ºs by Jean-Joseph Mouret and titular character Philom√®le in Philom√®le by Louis Lacoste. She was described as capricious and volatile, however, and she suddenly left the Opera in 1725 after a performance of Les √©l√©mens.  Rivalry and overnight imprisonment  This period of her career was marked by a rivalry with Marie P√©lissier, which was fueled by audiences who were divided between the singers. Lemaure sensed a challenge and returned from her retirement. This caused \\"disputes\\" during the first run of Pirame et Thisb√© and began the rivalry between the sopranos and their fans, called the \\"mauriens\\" and the \\"p√©lissiens\\" after their idols. Lemaure again retired from 1727 to 1730, returning in H√©sione, followed by singing Oriane in Amadis in 1731, Iphise in Jepht√©'s first run in 1732, the titular character in Iss√© in 1733, and Iphig√©nie in 1734's Iphig√©nie en Tauride. In 1735, she was forced to appear in that year's revival of Jepht√© by threats of imprisonment if she would not do so; therefore, she intentionally bombed the performance and was booed by the audience.Julie Anne Sadie, Guide de la Musique baroque, Fayard1995 After she refused to continue, she was detained overnight at For-l'√âv√™que, a Parisian prison, until she returned the next night to sing the role correctly. In 1735, she took another retirement.  Late career and final decades  In 1740, Lemaure returned to the stage. She received ovations for her performances of Oriane and Iphise that year. In 1744, she took over the role of Iphise in Dardanus from P√©lissier herself, who had played that role as a member of its premiere cast. She entered her final retirement that year, not through any deficiencies in performance but through her capriciousness. In 1762, Lemaure married the baron of Montbruel.Dieux et Divas de l'Op√©ra de Roger Blanchard et Roland de Cand√© ‚Äì Plon 1986 She died in Paris on 14 January 1786.  Artistry  Lemaure had a voice noted for its rare beauty and instinctively attained a great grandeur on stage, particularly in tragic roles. As audiences continued to idolize her, they compared her exceptional vocal talent to P√©lissier's skilled artistry, with Voltaire writing that he preferred \\"P√©lissier pour son art, et le Maure pour sa voix.\\" She had a \\"personal fascination in performance\\" and received much description from Jean- Benjamin de La Borde. Voltaire wrote in 1741 that \\"sans la voix de la le Maure, & le canard de Vaucanson, vous n'auriez rien qui fit ressouvenir de la gloire de la France.\\" (\\"Without the voice of le Maure and Vaucanson's duck, you would have nothing to remind you of the glory of France.\\") Though she retired in 1744, Voltaire and the Mercure de France continued to praise her and refer to her work into the 1770s.  Repertoire  Lemaure performed many roles throughout her career: *Astrea in Pha√´ton (Lully), 1721 * Libya in Pha√´ton (Lully), 1722 * Hippodamie in Piritho√ºs (Mouret), 1723 (created role) * Philom√®le in Philom√®le (Lacoste), 1723 * Pomone in Les √©l√©mens (Destouches, Delalande), 1725 * A role in H√©sione (Campra), 1730 * Oriane in Amadis (Lully), 1731, 1740 * Iphise in Jepht√© (Mont√©clair), 1732 (created role), 1735, 1740 * Iss√© in Iss√© (Destouches), 1733 * Iphig√©nie in Iphig√©nie en Tauride (Desmarets, Campra), 1734 * Iphise in Dardanus (Rameau), 1744  References  Category:1704 births Category:1786 deaths Category:French operatic sopranos Category:18th-century French women Category:18th-century women singers Category:18th-century French opera singers Category:Singers from Paris ","title":"Catherine-Nicole Lemaure"},{"id":"57963829","text":" øAbd AllƒÅh ibn KhƒÅzim ibn ·∫íabyƒÅn al-Sulamƒ´ () (died 692) was the Umayyad governor of Khurasan in 662‚Äì665 and late 683/84, before becoming the nominal Zubayrid governor of the same province between 684 and his death. Life =Early career= Abd Allah ibn Khazim was the son of a certain Khazim ibn Zabyan of the Banu Sulaym tribe and the latter's wife Ajla.Humphreys 1990, pp. 36‚Äì37 In 651/52, during the first Muslim campaign into Khurasan, Abdallah ibn Amir put Ibn Khazim in command of the Arab army's advance guard and the latter captured the town of Sarakhs.Gibb 1960, p. 47. He was later appointed by Caliph Uthman (r. 644‚Äì656) governor of Nishapur, alongside Ibn Khazim's paternal cousin Qays ibn al-Haytham al-Sulami. Toward the end of his reign, Uthman combined the administrative districts east of Basra into the single province of Khurasan, though it remained a dependency of Basra, under the governorship of Qays. The latter made Ibn Khazim his envoy to the governor of Basra, Ibn Amir. According to historian al-Tabari, Ibn Khazim acquired a document from Ibn Amir that declared Ibn Khazim governor of Khurasan should Qays depart the province. Indeed, when Uthman was assassinated in January 656, Qays departed Khurasan to probe the situation in Iraq and Ibn Khazim was given authority over the province until being dismissed by Caliph Ali (r. 656‚Äì661) later that year. Abdallah ibn Amir was reinstated as governor of Basra that year, he dispatched Ibn Khazim and Abd al-Rahman ibn Samura to restore Muslim rule to Balkh and Sijistan (Sistan), while Qays was made governor of Khurasan. When the latter proved incapable of controlling the province, he was replaced by Ibn Khazim, who put down a rebellion in Qarin in 662. He remained governor of the province until being dismissed in 665 by Ziyad ibn Abih, who had since replaced Ibn Amir as governor of Basra. =Governor of Khurasan= Ibn Khazim was later part of a group of Arab tribal commanders that accompanied Salm ibn Ziyad to Khurasan in 681 from Basra when Salm was appointed governor of Khurasan by Caliph Yazid I (r. 680‚Äì683).Howard 1991, p. 186. Salm left Ibn Khazim in charge of the province after fleeing in the wake of the successive deaths of caliphs Yazid and his son Mu'awiya II in 683 and 684, which caused the collapse of Umayyad rule.CNG Coins Ibn Khazim gave his allegiance to the Mecca-based caliph Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr.Zakeri 1995, p. 230. Early on, he contended with mutinies by troops from the Rabi'a tribe and the military governors of Herat and Marw al-Rudh, who both hailed from the Banu Bakr tribe. He was assisted in their suppression by troops from the Banu Tamim, another large tribal faction from which many Khurasani Arab troops hailed. He installed his son Muhammad at Herat while he took up his headquarters at Marw al-Rudh. Afterward, the Tamim revolted, captured Herat and killed Muhammad before turning their attention toward Ibn Khazim. However, before they could move against him, dissension developed among them and their rebel army disbanded. Ibn Khazim's position in Khurasan was strong when the Umayyads under Caliph Abd al-Malik defeated and killed Ibn al-Zubayr and his brother Mus'ab in Mecca and Iraq. Thus, he refused to pay allegiance to Abd al-Malik when the latter demanded it, despite being offered the governorship for a further seven years.Fishbein 1990, p. 209.Kennedy 2007, pp. 240‚Äì241. In response, Abd al-Malik allied with a factional leader of the Tamim, Bukayr ibn Wisha al-Sa'di, who agreed to eliminate Ibn Khazim in return for the governorship of Khurasan. By the end of the year, Ibn Khazim had been confronted on his way to his son Musa's fortified stronghold at Tirmidh, but was intercepted and killed by Bukayr's troops. According to al-Tabari, the troops of a rival Tamimi commander, Bahir ibn Warqa, killed Ibn Khazim in the village of Shahmighad, north of Marw, but Bukayr seized Ibn Khazim's severed head and sent it to Abd al-Malik taking credit for the slaying.Fishbein 1990, pp. 210‚Äì211. Before he died, Ibn Khazim reportedly spat at his killer, a tribesman whose brother Ibn Khazim had previously executed, exclaiming defiantly that he was chief of the Mudar tribal confederation, while his killer's brother was a mere peasant. A poet from his tribe lamented his loss, declaring \\"Now only barking dogs remain. After you there is no lion's roar on Earth\\".Kennedy 2007, p. 241. Indeed, Ibn Khazim's career was posthumously chronicled in epics that extolled his military prowess, which historian H. A. R. Gibb asserts \\"makes it difficult to establish many details with precision.\\"Gibb 1960, p. 48. Ibn Khazim's grandson, Salim ibn Sulayman, was a lieutenant commander in the army of Muslim ibn Sa'id al-Kilabi, governor of Khurasan in 722‚Äì724.Blankinship 1989, p. 10.

He became known for his quote: \\"Gentlemen, never confess! Never admit!\\"  Biography  = Youth = Jean-Charles-Alphonse Avinain was born on October 14, 1798, in Torcy. He was a soldier, who distinguished himself on two occasions: at the age of 15 he bravely fought against the Cossacks during the Invasion of France by Allied troops, and the second time during as a part of the Hundred Thousand Sons of Saint Louis in 1823. By profession he was a butcher, but Avinain eventually turned towards theft, which earned him six convictions. During his detention at the central house in Melun, he assisted in autopsies and thus learned how to dissect. He made a stay in the sinister Devil's Island, which Captain Dreyfus was to know a few decades later. After spending 18 years in the Cayenne prison, he returned to the √éle-de-France in early 1867 at the age of 68, returning to Batignolles, the modest home in which his wife and daughter lived. They both welcomed him warmly. Excited, his wife and daughter suggested he use his strength and intelligence for better purposes. He announced to them that he would go into the fodder business. When his daughter asked him with what money, he replied: \\"In Guiana, I sold for two years the wine I made and earned more, and I also found 1700 francs, hidden near the box of a politic who died on Devil's Island. The money was in hard cash, but a vivandiere exchanged it to me for bank notes.\\" But such money did not exist. Under false civil status associated with his first names, he had rented premises on the banks of the Seine, Levallois-Perret and Courbevoie. Avinain had discovered a trick that allowed him to rent for a few days without loose stock through temporary lease agreements. = Murders = In January 1867, he rented a warehouse under a false name in the district of Montaigne Avenue, where he unloaded his first cart. It was bought on the morning of March 12 for 50 francs on the Charenton market from a man named Lucien Leconte. Avinain delayed maneuvers so well that unloading, when he had to pay, he announced that he did not have all the money on him and that he had to wait until next morning. But Leconte was wary and did not close his one eye. Avinain did not dare to attack him and in the first hours of dawn left, on the pretext of fetching the missing francs. From there his murders began. On March 16, 1867, Avinain was seen by several witnesses at the La Chapelle Market buying a load of one hundred bales of hay and three hundred bales of straw from a young grain merchant named Isidore Vincent and his wife. In the rented house in Courbevoie he murdered Vincent, stealing his straw and hay afterwards. On March 19, 1867, on the banks of the Seine on the Argenteuil side, workers saw a human body whose head and limbs were missing. The doctor who carried out the autopsy, Dr. Maurice, could not identify the victim. On the other hand, he was certain that the one who dismembered the victim was a butcher. Dr. Maurice also showed his finding to the imperial police: the body belonged to a 25-year-old man; it was submerged some fifteen kilometres downstream; the death dated back to three days and was likely caused by strangulation accomplished four or five hours after the last meal. Provided with this information, the police let their finest bloodhounds on the killer's trail. On the morning of June 26, an old man named Duguet went to La Chapelle market with a cart loaded with fodder, pulled by a white horse. Avinain approached him, offering to sell his goods, and they both left the market towards Levallois-Perret. In Levallois, they stowed the cart and went to eat soup at the Mathon restaurant and drink wine. After that, they were seen strolling on the banks of the Seine. Avinain, after a busy day, convinced Duguet to accept his hospitality for the night. And it was during his sleep that Duguet was hit seventeen times with a hammer, beaten to death by Avinain. = The investigation = On June 28, 1867, in Saint-Ouen, a torso was discovered. And a few days later, the arms, legs and head of the corpse were also found. The dean of the Faculty of Medicine, Professor Auguste Ambroise Tardieu, was responsible for conducting the autopsy. His conclusions largely matched those of Dr. Maurice: the death was caused by strangulation, with additional violent blows to the head by a blunt object while the victim was asleep, who was then butchered. A few days after the discovery the victim was identified: he was a 75-year-old man named Duguet, a farmer from Longperrier. The victim's white horse and cart were found; the former had been sold for four hundred francs to a man named Juquin, and the latter had been sold for forty francs to a cartwright-locksmith by a certain Jean Charles, a fodder merchant who lived in the city of Chasseurs. The investigators went to the address and discovered the man described by the witness, who was seen with Duguet. Avinain tried to escape through the sewers, but was captured at the exit by police. The searches then commenced. In Levallois-Perret, there were traces of blood and fodder belonging to Duguet were found. Despite the overwhelming evidence, Avinain denied his guilt, confusing magistrate Henriquez. The authorities promised him imperial grace only if he acknowledged his crimes, and he finally confessed. = The trial = On October 2, 1867, Avinain appeared before the cour d'assises of Seine, wearing a black frock coat and a white shirt plastron. He was defended by Master Massoni. At the hearing on October 26, 1867, the Advocate General wrote to the jury: \\"If there were any of those humanitarian philosophers in this room who doubted the efficacy of the death penalty, I ask them to look at the man who is struggling at this bench, this man to attaches all his hope to perpetual punishment and exhausts himself in vain efforts to obtain a sentence that leaves him alive. May this terrible villain be treated without pity. I declare loudly that I intend to claim my share of responsibility in the inflexible verdict that you will make\\". The president of the cour d'assises, Councilor Charles Berriat- Saint-Prix made the following statement: \\"Gentlemen jurors...I can not let you believe that, even if you dismiss the premeditation, Avinain would not incur death. Know indeed that under the terms of article 304 of the Penal Code, the murder carries the supreme punishment, when it had for object (...) to prepare, facilitate or execution of a simple crime, for example that of flight\\". But the prosecutor and the President of the cour d'assises drew attention to the \\"incurable perversity of the condemned and the atrocity of his crimes\\". Master Massoni wrote to Napoleon III on November 23, and even Avinain himself sent a petition to the Emperor. However, nothing could be done: the date of execution was set to be on November 27, 1867. = The execution = Avinain was the only one to repulse with violence the Abb√© Crozes, the chaplain of the convict depot at the La Roquette Prisons. Avinain said to him: \\"You are wasting your time, I do not believe in your fuss\\". On November 28, 1867, the executioner was Jean-Fran√ßois Heidenreich, and the execution took place at the roundabout of Roquette, between the convict deposit and women's prison. The crowd that came to watch Avinain's execution would not see much, as there was too much fog. The assembly of the guillotine was done by the light of a battery of torches. Meanwhile, Mr. Claude, the police chief, came to wake up Avinain. He put on his clothes and emptied the glass of wine handed to him by the prison's chaplain. After twenty days of resistance to the clergyman, Avinain finally confessed. He thanked Mr. Claude for his consideration, saying: \\"The world treated me too badly for me to regret leaving him. I am a man and will die a man\\". This did not prevent him from struggling with Heindenreich by insulting him, but was quickly calmed down. Avinain was treated to his exit. To the soldiers who made the hedge, he shouted: \\"Farewell, children of the fatherland!\\" And on the platform of the guillotine, facing a crowd he could not see, he said the words: \\"Gentlemen, never confess! Never admit!\\".  Description  \\"He was no longer young, but he seemed solidly built. The lips clear, the nose pointed, the face glabrous, the bare forehead, a few tufts of gray hair at the temples, he would not have seemed distinct without his false eye deep in the orbit under thick black eyebrows\\".  Posterity  The last sentence of Avinain, \\"Never admit!\\" has remained famous. In Guillaume Apollinaire's erotic novel Les Onze Mille Verges, a verse reads as follows: \\"Your hands will introduce my beautiful member Asinin In the sacred brothel open between your thighs And I want to admit you, despite Avinain, What makes your love as long as you enjoy!\\" The famous lawyer Ren√© Floriot said: \\"Do not ever admit it\\" is an adverse legal advice, but still excellent in love.

The film showed previously unpublished surveillance video that director Jason Pollock alleges was concealed from jury members and the public in order to tarnish Brown's image. Filmmaker Jason Pollock, spent two years filming to document civil unrest in Ferguson following the failed indictment of former Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson over charges in Brown's killing. Stranger Fruit premiered March 11, 2017, at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas. The film showed previously unreleased footage of Michael Brown visiting Ferguson Market about twelve hours before police were called after Brown assaulted the store's owner at the same location. In the footage Brown appears to trade clerks a small bag of drugs, asserted by Pollock to be marijuana, for store cigarillos. Jason Pollock said the video showed Brown returning the cigarillos to the clerks for safekeeping; thus rather than stealing merchandise later that day, Brown was leaving with cigarillos he believed he had paid for. The clip was immediately disputed by Jay Kanzler, a lawyer for the convenience store, who said there was \\"no understanding,\\" \\"[n]o agreement\\" between Brown and the store. Kanzler said, the clerks \\"didn‚Äôt sell him cigarillos for pot,\\" and that [Brown] returned the cigarillos because the employees refused to accept the marijuana as payment. Protesters, believing claims the video was purposely withheld as part of a police cover-up, gathered outside Ferguson Market on March 12. Police arrested three people, including one man who allegedly attempted to set fire to a police cruiser. One officer was also injured. St. Louis County's prosecuting office released unedited store surveillance footage March 13, which county Prosecuting Attorney Robert P. McCulloch said made it \\"very clear that there was no transaction between Mr. Brown and the store employees.\\" Kanzler said Brown's attempted bargaining with the store clerks \\"was heated,‚Äù and ultimately rejected: the extended video appears to show clerks returned the small bag to Brown, which he then left with. The footage also showed a clerk returning Brown's attempted purchase to the shelf shortly after, which Kanzler said ruled out a trade. Pollock defended the documentary's claims, and asserted ‚Äú[t]he exchange is made. They kept the weed.‚Äù He further claimed ‚Äú[t]he weed never goes back to [Brown]. We see that‚Äù in the footage.

The grounds of the park were originally part of an estate owned by Ernest Royden which comprised the park, Hill Bark house and Thurstaston Common. Upon his death the estate passed to Hoylake council and was opened to the public for recreation. The park features a visitor centre, walled garden, miniature railway, woodland walks and a lake. History In the 1820s the land on which the park now sits was heath and woodland. During the 1860s a house called Hillbark was built on the estate and the area was planted and landscaped. In the 1870s a coach house and walled garden were added. In 1928 the estate was passed to Ernest Royden who demolished the earlier residence and moved his own house brick by brick to the site. This house is now known as Hill Bark. After the death of Royden in 1960, the estate including Hill Bark, Thurstaston Common and Royden Park was sold to Hoylake Urban District Council. Royden Park and Thurstaston Common were opened for public recreation. Hill Bark became an old people's home and is now a privately owned hotel and wedding venue. Following local government re-organisation in 1974 Wirral Council now manage the park and common. Features Roodee mere The park features a large lake called Roodee Mere where fishing is allowed with a permit. A miniature railway takes passengers around the grounds every Sunday afternoon weather permitting. The old coach house for Hill Bark has been converted for use as a cafe and resource centre. There are conifer woodland walks, meadows with nature walks, car parking, a walled garden and family events. Nature The park and commons are managed as a local nature reserve offering a range of habitats for plants, insects, flowers and wildlife. Walled garden The Laburnum arch The park has a walled garden which was built in 1870 as the kitchen garden for Hill Bark house and is a fine example of Victorian architecture. The garden is used as a community resource. A laburnum arch was added by the Wirral Model Engineering Society who operate the miniature railway. Contained within the walls are a herb garden, a bog garden, a flower garden and a traditional cottage garden that originally grew plants for medicinal purposes. Model railways The miniature railway Wirral Model Engineers Society operate two miniature railways at the park. The society came into existence in 1961 and they have been developing the railway track and facilities ever since. The first railway is a combined 2¬Ω, 3¬Ω and 5¬Ω inch gauge raised track for detailed scale models of full size steam locomotives, this track was extended in 1980 to 1,200 feet. The second railway is a 7¬º inch gauge ridable miniature railway pulled by a traction locomotive, this track was extended to 2,267 feet in 2004.

Much of the church dates from the 12th century, with additions made later in the Middle Ages. It contains medieval murals which were discovered and restored in 1967. Fj√§lkinge Church belongs to the Diocese of Lund. History and architecture Interior view towards the choir with murals visible The church was built during the 12th century and preceded by a wooden church built 1130 ‚Äì 1140. The typically broad, Romanesque western tower, the nave, choir and apse all date from the construction period; the tower was built first and possibly as much as fifty years earlier than the rest of the church. The tower has been attributed to one of the master stonemasons working on the construction of Lund Cathedral, or possibly the master stonemason responsible for lading the construction at F√§rl√∂v Church. The layout of its ground floor suggest that it may have served as a private chapel for a local lord. The church has been rebuilt and expanded in stages. During the middle of the 13th century, the present vault of the choir was constructed. During the late Middle Ages, church porches were probably constructed both in front of the northern and the southern entrances to the church; only the one in front of the southern entrance is preserved. A northern transept was added in 1763, and a thorough restoration of the church carried out in 1832. On the cemetery at some distance from the church itself stands another medieval building, probably originally a residential building, which for a long time served as a lychgate. Murals During a restoration of the church in 1967, medieval murals were discovered under layers of whitewash on the vaults of the church. They were made 1475-1500 by an otherwise unknown artist, occasionally referred to as the Fj√§lkinge Master. After their discovery, other murals in Sk√•ne have been attributed to this workshop. Other sources however claim that they are by the painter Nils H√•kansson, an artist who made the paintings in Vittsk√∂vle Church, among others. The paintings depict scenes from the Bible. On the western vault, the creation and the fall of man are depicted, while on the eastern vault the Last Judgment is depicted. The style of the pictures has been described as \\"na√Øve\\". Furnishings The oldest item in the church is the Romanesque baptismal font, dating from the 12th century and decorated with imaginary beasts. The altarpiece is from 1604, and the pulpit likewise dates from the beginning of the 17th century.

Life Sheridan was the eldest child of former Chief Secretary for Ireland Thomas Sheridan and his wife Helen Appleby. Appleby was the daughter of Thomas Appleby of Linton-on- Ouse, Yorkshire, although she was rumoured by contemporaries to be an illegitimate child of James II,Geoghegan, V. Sheridan, Sir Thomas, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography and the Sheridans were consistent supporters of Stuart interests. They were an old Irish family originally from County Cavan; Sheridan's grandfather, Dionysius or Denis Sheridan, had converted to Protestantism in his youth and became vicar of Killasher under the patronage of Bishop Bedell. The extended family were part of a relict group of Protestant Ormondist Tories who continued to adhere to the Jacobite cause in Ireland.O Ciardha (2002) Ireland and the Jacobite cause, 1685-1766, Four Courts, p.215 Following the 1688 deposition of James II, Sheridan's father joined the Jacobite court in exile in France. In 1710 Sheridan studied law at the Middle Temple, but later became involved in the Jacobite rising of 1715 as a courier. He was afterwards given a variety of conspiratorial or diplomatic missions on behalf of the Jacobite court, including the channeling of correspondence between Ireland and France. O Ciardha (2002) p.140 In 1725 he was appointed governor to Charles Stuart: Charles developed a close and affectionate relationship with Sheridan, and often sought his advice in later years. He was created a baronet in the Jacobite peerage in March 1726. During the 1745 rising Sheridan, despite poor health - he suffered from asthma and had already had one stroke - was one of the initial seven companions of the Prince, the \\"Seven Men of Moidart\\". Along with John O'Sullivan he was the subject of repeated complaints, from the Scottish Jacobite leadership, of Irish influence on Charles. After the failure of the rising he returned to France. He died in Rome in 1746. Many details of Sheridan's life remain obscure. Some modern sources claim that he was in his seventies in 1745 and was a veteran of the Boyne, though this is unlikely, and he is variously described as a Catholic, a Protestant, or (like his father) as a Catholic convert. O'Callaghan and a number of other sources describe Michael Sheridan, an Irish Brigade officer who was involved in parts of the 1745 Rising, as Sheridan's son, though he is elsewhere described as his nephew.

In 1994, Jennings would briefly form a band called Septic Tank with Lee Dorrian, Repulsion vocalist and bassist Scott Carlson and Trouble drummer Barry Stern. Cathedral would announce their breakup shortly after the release of their 2013 album The Last Spire, leading to Jennings reforming Septic Tank, this time with Jaime \\"Gomez\\" Arellano, due to Barry Stern's death in 2005.

It is part of the North Cascades Range and is situated one mile south of Cascade Pass on the shared border of North Cascades National Park and Glacier Peak Wilderness. The nearest higher peak is Magic Mountain, to the east-southeast. Mix-up Peak is at the northern end of the Ptarmigan Traverse which is an alpine route to remote mountains such as Mount Formidable and Dome Peak. The Cache Glacier occupies a cirque below its eastern flank. Surface runoff on the east side the mountain drains into the Stehekin River, whereas precipitation runoff drains into the Cascade River from the west side. Climate Mix-up Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology Mix-up Peak in winter The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

It was founded in 1995 but, with antecedents dating back to the Southern Song Dynasty (). History From the 1980s, a group of artists and scholars from China Academy of Art (), Zhejiang University (), Nankai University () and Xiling Seal Art Society () had discussed the idea of forming an independent institution for Chinese arts and culture studies that echoes to the Imperial Art Academy founded by Emperor Gaozong () 800 years ago on the lakeside of WulinMichael Sullivan(1999), \\"The Arts of China\\", Vol.8, 45 pp. 179-183.

In 1997, the archaeological excavation at the Imperial Library of Wenlan began and the Institute moved out, cooperated with the Government of Gongshu District and became Hushu Society of Arts(HSA). In the same year, members of Dazhen institute dismissed HSA and established Meilan Society of Arts(MSA) for independence. The influence of MSA had grown for rebuilding the disintegrated tradition of Chinese art since the havoc of the New Culture Movement in mid 1910s and ten years' Cultural Revolution. In 2000 the government cancelled the MSA's license for 'political' reasons to suppress on independent studies and many of its members fled to Europe and America for extrication.

Charlap served as rabbi of the Sha'arei Hesed neighborhood in central Jerusalem, and author of the Mei Marom series of books on Jewish thought. Biography Charlap was born in Jerusalem in 1882, where his father served as a rabbinic judge (dayyan) in the bet din of Rabbi Yehoshua Leib Diskin. Shortly after Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook arrived in Israel in 1904, the two developed a close relationship; Charlap was particularly influenced by Kook's thought. When the Sha'arei Hesed neighborhood of Jerusalem was established outside the Old City in 1908, Charlap was appointed rabbi of the neighborhood. In 1924, when Rabbi Kook established the Mercaz HaRav yeshiva, Charlap was appointed Rosh Yeshiva, a position he held until his death in 1951.

Vietnamese diaspora is the dispersion of Vietnamese people living outside of Vietnam. Scholars indicate that the Vietnamese diaspora is unique because of its complex \\"historical roots of refugee-exile circumstances.\\" At the same time, Priscilla Koh asserts that \\"overseas Vietnam\\" should not be grouped as one massive \\"undifferentiated category\\" because periods of departure are not only complex, but their political eras should also be thoughtfully considered. Koh further states that during the 20th century, Vietnam has experienced several instances of \\"mass emigration\\" due to war, poverty, opportunities to study abroad, and political changes. In many cases, narratives of the Vietnamese diasporic community often foregrounds the memories and experiences of pre-1975 wartime, or pre-war narratives, and post-war refugees, particularly the Fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975. Stuart Cunningham and Tina Nguyen state that from 1965 to 1975, during the \\"height\\" of the Vietnam War, or what is often considered and labeled as the \\"American War,\\" more than half of Vietnam's population were \\"displaced internally,\\" being dispersed throughout the world and into \\"host countries\\" such as the United States, France, Canada, Australia, or Germany. It was reported that about a hundred thousand Vietnamese were in other countries outside of Vietnam in 1975. According to a 2018 report from the Migration Policy Institute, at the end of the Vietnam War, about 125,000 Vietnamese refugees were evacuated and brought into United States sponsored bases and refugee camps. In 1975, displaced refugees - as they were labeled - from Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia increased, allowing families to be \\"admitted\\" into the United States. The Vietnamese immigration population has increased every decade. The Migration Policy Institute reports that more than 1.3 million Vietnamese relocated to the United States, making the Vietnamese community the sixth largest community to reside in the country. Between the years of 2012 to 2016, immigrants from Vietnam often relocated to California (39%), Texas (13%), and Washington State and Florida (both 4%).  Narratives  Currently, post-war narratives are centralized in both Vietnamese and Vietnamese-American writing, further exemplifying memories of pre-1975 and colonialism through a reflective post-war lens. An emergence of Vietnamese literature, specifically diasporic Vietnamese literature, has become more visible in recent years. This is perhaps due to how Western historians, scholars, and writers often report on the Vietnam War. Ken Burns' and Lynn Novick's documentary about the Vietnam War, a ten-part, eighteen hour documentary that aired on PBS, for example, included personal stories from both U.S. and Vietnamese participants in the war. Even Aimee Phan notes, expectations for the documentary were high because Burns' approach to the topic was going to be different as the producers were aiming to be more inclusive in their documentary, including multiple perspectives and sides of the war, both from South Vietnamese and North Vietnamese soldiers and civilians. However, Phan further notes that she was disappointed with the documentary because Burns and Novick, who both directed the documentary, seemed to re-center the narrative back to \\"its shiny centers: the white American soldier and his complex feelings of fear, hatred, guilt and remorse.\\" The narrative becomes historically normative, canonical, excluding other perspectives and voices that are considered otherized or othered. Phan further critiques the documentary, asserting: > The little coverage these other voices receive does little to right the > balance. Like nearly every movie or book about the war, Vietnamese lives > remains in the background, no matter that it is their land, homes and people > the war is destroying. American prisoners of war receive significant > airtime, while the aftermath of the war and the refugee experience are > hardly acknowledged. Little respect is paid to the Vietnamese voices, which > are diverse and complicated, and communicate as much pain and regret as the > Americans'. Linda Trinh V√µ shares a similar perspective, noticing that whenever she hears anything about the \\"Vietnam War\\" in the media, the references are almost never about Vietnamese or Vietnamese-Americans. Because of stereotypes and caricatures created by Western media such as the categorical label of FOB (fresh off the boat), Vietnamese and Vietnamese-Americans find it difficult to situate themselves into their own narratives, theories, research, teachings, or pedagogies. In many cases, they dissociate themselves from their own identities or are completely excluded from their own cultural and historical narratives, which is often an exclusionary practice within academia. In an op- ed titled, \\"The Great Vietnam War Novel Was Not Written by an American,\\" published by The New York Times ,Viet Thanh Nguyen, author of The Sympathizer and The Refugees argues that several works written by Vietnamese-Americans are often ignored by \\"the American and Vietnamese mainstream.\\" Nguyen specifically mentions Bao Ninh's novel The Sorrow of War, which Nguyen considers a \\"North Vietnamese war classic\\" is a \\"worthy\\" historical based novel that is often ignored in mainstream historical canon. He further contends that Vietnamese- American voices are only sporadically visibly \\"heard here\\" and then \\"forgotten\\" and \\"rarely heard in Vietnam.\\" Diaspora becomes a poignant focal point in Vietnamese literature. In an interview with diaCRITICS, Viet Thanh Nguyen, who is also the founding editor of diaCRITICS, states that definition of diaspora derives from the displacement and exile of Jewish communities. In the same interview, Nguyen asserts the importance of diaspora: Vietnamese- American novelist Viet Thanh Nguyen, author of The Sympathizer, which won the 2016 alt= > There are very strong connotations of an originary homeland, a sense of > persecution, and a nostalgic desire for home. If we look at contemporary > Jewish and Israeli discourses, there is also a strong sense of essentialism > and nationalism, and a potential for both progressive and reactionary > politics. All of these features, to me, seem accurate in describing how > many, if not all, Vietnamese migrants of the 1970s until recently felt. In > the largest overseas Vietnamese communities of the United States, France, > Germany, Canada, and Australia, it seems that there is a diasporic > consciousness, even if they are not all the same. The French Vietnamese, for > example, go back to the early 20th century and include explicitly vocal > leftist and communist people, completely unlike Vietnamese Americans. But > diaspora can include differences, and part of the purpose of diaCRITICS is > to show what we as Vietnamese people share and do not share.  Themes  Recurring themes include isolation, displacement, dislocation, alienation, reconciling cultural and generational complexities, identity loss, familial piety and individual autonomy, citizenship, assimilation and acculturation are common in diasporic Vietnamese literature. Such themes explore the complexities of cultural conflicts and raises questions on the complexities of transnational identities.  Pre-1975 Music: Nh·∫°c V√†ng  = The Emergence of Pre-1975 Nh·∫°c V√†ng = Aside from Vietnamese literature, pre- war and postwar Vietnamese narratives arguably gained mass and public interest through the broadcasting of Vietnamese music. While Vietnamese music encompasses different genres such as nh√£ nh·∫°c, ch√®o, d√¢n ca, quan h·ªç, h√°t ch·∫ßu vƒÉn, ca tr√π, h√≤, h√°t x·∫©m, and tu·ªìng c·∫£i l∆∞∆°ng, it was arguably pre-1975 music or nh·∫°c v√†ng (literal translation: golden music) and nh·∫°c ti·ªÅn chi·∫øn (pre- Indochina War music) that highlighted, and eventually archived, the experiences, thoughts, and feelings of civilians through the pre-war, during the war, and post-war eras. Kieu Linh Caroline Valverde notes that t√¢n nh·∫°c (modern music) was influenced by the \\"French presence\\" in the early 19th century. Vietnam was introduced to French music after the French's military occupation of H√† N·ªôi in 1873. Perhaps due to the French colonization, the French ‚Äúinjections‚Äù of their popular music became infused with Vietnamese contemporary music, which was increasingly influenced by other cultural and international influences as well. Singers such as Th√°i Thanh and Kh√°nh Ly, the latter is known for singing songs composed by Tr·ªãnh C√¥ng S∆°n, were/are labeled as ‚Äúsang‚Äù singers while singers such as Thanh Tuy·ªÅn and Ch·∫ø Linh, the latter also a recognized pre-1975 composer were/are considered s·∫øn or b√¨nh d√¢n (traditional folk) singers. Bolero music remains the most popular music genre in Vietnam. The style was influenced from Latin American music and was introduced in Vietnam in the 1950s, becoming a staple musical genre in South Vietnam, and much of its popularity is attributed to the emergence of pre-1975 music, which carried over into diasporic Vietnamese communities. 177x177px Some of the many famous and recognized composers of pre-1975 Vietnamese songs include: Tr√∫c Ph∆∞∆°ng, Tr·∫ßn Thi·ªán Thanh (also a singer, director, and actor), Ch√¢u K·ª≥, Duy Kh√°nh (also a famous singer and music teacher), Ho√†ng Thi Th∆°, H·ªì ƒê√¨nh Ph∆∞∆°ng, Nh·∫≠t Ng√¢n, L√™ Dinh, Minh K·ª≥, Anh B·∫±ng, Lam Ph∆∞∆°ng,Y V√¢n, T√¢m Anh, and several composers who have been recognized for the contributions in the Vietnamese music industry pre-war and post-war. There were several singers who emerged during the pre-1975 Vietnamese music era.

Vietnamese music became diasporic, or sometimes known as Vi·ªát Ki·ªÅu (often translates to overseas Vietnamese population) music has currently progressed in the United States since 1975. Valverde further notes that pre-1975 music is \\"influenced by sentiments of exile and ideologies of anti-communism\\" and additionally, diasporic Vietnamese music \\"has a special blend of nostalgia that appeals not only to members of diasporic communities but also to residents of Viet Nam.\\" Vietnamese musicians and singers, most of whom were refugees and immigrants, were apprehensive on adapting and acculturating to their new homes or host countries. Vietnamese recording artists found that music served as bridge that connected refugees and \\"exiles to the homeland they thought they had lost.\\" Overseas, or diasporic, singers today, those who were born during the war as children or born after 1975 such as Nh∆∞ Qu·ª≥nh, Tr∆∞·ªùng V≈©, and Th·∫ø S∆°n continue to record, sing, and perform various songs written and composed by several pre-1975 Vietnamese composers. Vietnamese music began to flourish in the Vietnamese entertainment industry in the late 1970s and early 1980s, mobilizing a new industry for the Vietnamese community. = Th√∫y Nga Productions = One of the many popular Vietnamese music recording studios that continues to exist today is Th√∫y Nga Productions, founded by T√¥ VƒÉn Lai, who was a university psychology, in 1963. Though, conflicting research indicates that Lai founded Th√∫y Nga in 1969. Th√∫y Nga, which T√¥ named after his wife, is perhaps the largest and \\"most successful\\" recording company, creating a marketing \\"vision\\" called Paris by Night. T√¥ experienced \\"alienation\\" as a refugee, a feel shared by other Vietnamese refugees, and worked to \\"to find a solution\\" that could be both distracting and entertaining.\\" His goal was to establish Th√∫y Nga as a recording and production label, which \\"actuated T√¥'s stance as a cultural intellectual bringing traditional folk and contemporary Vietnamese music traditions into contact with popular American and French music.\\" Paris by Night products, particularly the live recording shows sold in VHS, DVD, and Blu-rays formats and mass productions of CDs, evoked a sense of nostalgic pre-1975 sentiments and re-generating a \\"revival of cabaret music and entertainment from previously well-established Vietnamese performers.\\" Pre-1975 never disappeared for Vietnamese refugees and immigrants. Kieu Linh Caroline Valverde adds: > In the first decade after the fall of Sai Gon, pre-1975 music was the staple > of the Vietnamese American community. So popular was this genre of maudlin > ballads from the wartime years that it has invoked some to call Vietnamese > American popular music 'culture in a bubble.' Indeed, for over a decade > after 1975, the same songs - be it western or Vietnamese that were popular > in the nightclubs of Sai Gon during the Viet Nam war - were still being > heard in coffee shops and nightclubs and sold in music stores. The first video produced by Paris by Night was produced and recorded in Paris, costing about $19,000 in U.S. dollars. By the 1990s, Paris by Night products increased in production values, the mass production of their products, and popularity, allowing Th√∫y Nga to consistently to \\"release at least four videos a year, consisting of usually 24 performances from a range of international Vietnamese performers, a stage and technical crew of approximately three hundred people, often recording in front of packed audiences. Production costs per video have moved to US$500,000.\\" Nguy·ªÖn Ng·ªçc Ng·∫°n, a Vietnamese-Canadian writer and essayist, and Nguy·ªÖn Cao K·ª≥ Duy√™n, the only daughter of Nguy·ªÖn Cao K·ª≥, often appear as the hosts of Paris by Night live recording shows. T√¥ eventually moved Th√∫y Nga's headquarters to Orange County, California, maintaining operations there since December 29, 1995. The decision to move headquarters was due to both \\"rising costs of production\\" and an increasing demand for live recordings to be produced in the U.S. and Canada. = Asia Entertainment = Asia Entertainment is another Vietnamese-oriented production and recording studio and company that is dedicated in offering high production values. Asia Entertainment was first established in the U.S. in the early 1980s and is owned by \\"shareholders and run by a manager.\\" Cunningham and Nguyen note one of the main distinctions between Asia Entertainment and Th√∫y Nga: > Asia reaches out beyond the established community performers, focusing on > promoting new talent in the U.S. and Canada. Through an annual 'star search' > competition, Tr√∫c H·ªì, Asia's music director [and musician and producer], > scouts for talent, offering contracts to perform live shows, video-taping > and CD recordings for the company. It also encourages its audiences to take > part in the 'quest of stardom' by testing talent using its karaoke > recordings, and then sending in tapes of the performances. And like many Vietnamese-based production companies, Asia maintains their revenue and profit from ticket sales of their live shows and \\"the domestic sale of CDs, videos and karaoke discs.\\" = Music of the Exilic: An Industry of Nostalgia = The Vietnamese music industry flourished due to nostalgic memories of Vietnam, specifically the nostalgia \\"of a homeland before communism remains strong\\" for first-generation Vietnamese refugees because the songs, which were \\"nationalistic in nature, carried images of a glorious past and a hope of returning to the homeland.\\" Songs about the homeland were/are now considered memories of the past for the exiled. Kieu Linh Caroline Valverde specifically references Ph·∫°m Duy's song, \\"1954 Cha Bo Que - 1975 Con Bo Nuoc\\" (translation: \\"The Exiles of a Father and His Son\\"]. This song was a reflection of how a father \\"had to leave the communist-controlled north in 1954 for the south; twenty years later his son had to feel Viet Nam altogether for the same reasons.\\"  References  Category:Vietnamese culture ","title":"Diasporic Vietnamese narratives"},{"id":"57964690","title":"List of current Nepalese governors"},{"id":"57964697","text":"Justin Thomas Newman (born 17 February 1995) is a Namibian rugby union player for the n national team and for the in the Rugby Challenge.

It was first published in 1865, and a heavily edited version was published without the author's permission in 1875 as a set text for schools. The original publication of the earlier of the essays contained in the book introduced the Narmad Era of Gujarati literature. Overview Narmadashankar Dave (1833‚Äì1886), popularly known by his pen-name, Narmad, was a Gujarati language writer. He was the first Gujarati writer who had had an English education. Through his writing he brought the literature of the west to readers of Gujarati. He heralded a new era in Gujarati literature, known as the Narmad Era. Narmad's first article, written in 1853, was an essay entitled \\"Mandali Malvathi Thata Labh\\" (English: \\"Advantages of Forming an Assembly\\"). Before 1856 he worked as an editor of Buddivardhak Granth ( A Book of Knowledge), a Gujarati monthly magazine published by Buddhivardhak Sabha, and wrote articles on various subjects of contemporary interest. In 1864, he started his own magazine called Dandio ( Drumstick), again writing many articles himself. Publication history In 1865, Narmad published the first edition of Narma Gadya with his photograph on the first page. In the introduction of the book he wrote: In 1866, he published Suratni Mukhtesar Hakikat (English: A Brief History of Surat), a sociopolitical history of his hometown Surat. He referred to the book as Narma Gadya Book II, Part I. In the same year he published his autobiography Mari Hakikat (English: My History) which he referred to as Narma Gadya Book II, Part II, in an edition of about five copies. These two books are considered to be integral parts of Narma Gadya. The history of Surat was included in the new edition, while Mari Hakikat was published under the same name. Contents The first book is divided into six parts. The first part consist of essays written on different subjects ranging from war ethics to the principles of literary criticism. In the second part there are two dialogues on social problems. The third part consists of his writings on various contemporary subjects, whereas the fourth consists of his serious writing on different subjects published in Buddhivardhak Granth. In the fifth there is a selection of his writings from his periodical Dandio, which are full of wit, humour, and satire, and in the sixth there are thirteen character sketches of medieval Gujarati poets. Most of the essays from these volumes are written in lecture-style; hence, sometimes, they are directly addressed to the local people. Further editions Difference between old Narmagadya and government Narmagadya The government decided to prescribe Narma Gadya as a text book for schools. In 1874, the Gujarati education department requested Narmad to prepare a school edition of Narma Gadya. Accordingly Narmad revised the book, made some changes and published two thousand copies of the revised edition in 1874. This edition was named Sarkari Narma Gadya ( Government Narma Gadya). However, a newly appointed head of the education department found some of the articles unsuitable for teaching in school and had all of these books destroyed. He asked for Narmad's opinion on further revising the book but did not receive a reply, and the work was entrusted to the department's Gujarati translator, Mahipatram Nilkanth. After making numerous changes, including deleting some sections, Mahipatram prepared a new edition which was published by the government in 1875. The revised edition and its interpretation caused a prolonged controversy about its authenticity. The debate about it continued until 1912, when Gujarati Printing Press republished the original edition of Narma Gadya. In 1974, Premananda Sahitya Sabha of Vadodara reprinted the 1874 edition of Narma Gadya, which had been revised by Narmad. Thus all the three editions of the book, the original edition from 1865, the revised edition of 1874, and the government edition of 1875, are available. Reception Navalram Pandya, a close associate of Narmad, praised the balanced writing style and the diction of the author's prose. He described it as simple, mature and dear equally to the educated and uneducated reader. The first essay, Mandali Malvathi Thata Labh, is regarded as a landmark in Gujarati literature by several scholars.

The novel was first published in Boston, in 1915, by Small, Maynard & Company. The story revolves around the life experiences of Ruth Holland, a young woman from a Midwestern town called Freeport, Iowa, who defies the societal mandates of her times when she falls in love with a married man and runs away to Colorado with him. When she returns to her hometown after 11 years, she has to deal with the death of her father, the break-up of her family, and the rejection of her loved ones. Although the novel was not well-received by critics when it was originally published, later reviews have been more positive, with Marcia Noe's Susan Glaspell: Voice from the Heartland proclaiming it to be Glaspell's best novel. Structure The novel is structured around 'moments of suspense and disclosure', and moves between past and present events and between the main story and subsidiary plots. Complex moral issues are looked at from multiple perspectives. The ambiguity of Ruth's dilemma is reflected in the use of the technique of shifting points of view originated by the psychologist William James. Glaspell sheds light on her subjects with various 'lamps', in the sense that different characters present their own standings regarding the concept of fidelity. Plot and Theme Fidelity is the third novel by Susan Glaspell and it elaborates on the concept of woman‚Äôs fidelity to marriage, men, society, family and especially to herself. For the plot, Glaspell got inspiration from her own life experience and mainly based on the relationship she had with George Cram Cook, who was married by the time they met and could not marry Glaspell until he got his divorce. The novel deals with Glaspell's major themes: the controversial relationship between women and society, and the conflicts arising from the clash between women's longing for freedom and their need to be part of a community or family that seek to suppress them. Ruth Holland, Glaspell's main character, is a fiery woman who struggles to become a new woman and to detach herself from the binary gender images advocated by the patriarchal society she lives in. She has to face the consequences of her doings and struggles to decide whether she has been unfaithful to society's demands or faithful to her needs and desires. According to Barbara Ozieblo Rajkowska, author of Susan Glaspell: A Critical Biography, Glaspell exposes moral issues in multiple perspectives, not just as contests between good and evil. In her novel, Glaspell deconstructs the romantic myths of love and marriage. Fidelity serves as commentary on what Glaspell saw as a middle-class society that prioritizes marriage as the ultimate goal, and shows that romantic love cannot be expected to fulfill everyone's existences.

It belongs to the Diocese of Lund. During the Middle Ages, the church was a local pilgrimage site for the veneration of Magnhild of Fulltofta. It contains many medieval murals, uncovered during a restoration of the church in the early 20th century. History Fulltofta Church was built approximately 1160‚Äì1175, possibly by the same workshop responsible for building the nearby church of Bosj√∂kloster, as indicated by the similarities between the unusual apses of the churches. These are decorated with sandstone lesenes. Fulltofta Church also has cornerstones of the same material, and still intact are the portals of the southern entrance and fragments of the northern portal. The main building material of the church is otherwise fieldstone. The tower is somewhat later, built during the 13th century and originally taller than it is at present. The church porch decorated with crow-stepped gables in front of the southern entrance was added during the course of the 14th century. Inside, the vaulted ceiling of the church was constructed during the 15th century, replacing an earlier ceiling. In the 17th century, a burial chapel was built for the family owning the nearby estate Fulltofta g√•rd. The tower was enlarged in 1809; the work was financed by the owner of Trollen√§s Castle, Arwid Trolle. A major restoration of the church was carried out in 1953. The church was built next to Fulltofta g√•rd, an estate which at the time belonged to the Bishop of Lund. During the Middle Ages, the place became a pilgrimage site for the locally venerated Saint Magnhild of Fulltofta. According to legend, Magnhild was a pious woman who was shot to death with an arrow from a bow by an assassin hired by her daughter-in-law in 1215. Her body was buried in or near Fulltofta Church, which became a local pilgrimage site until the saint's body was moved to Lund Cathedral in a solemn procession in 1383. Close to the church, a small spring named after the saint is supposed to have appeared at the place where the casket containing her body touched the ground, according to the legend. Interior =Murals= Interior view of the profusely decorated vaults The interior of the church is richly decorated with medieval murals, dating from the second half of the 15th century. They are considered to be made by an artist known by the notname Skivarpsm√§staren, after the murals in Skivarp Church which are believed to be by the same hand. They were rediscovered in 1907 after having been covered with whitewash since the Reformation, and uncovered in 1910‚Äì1912. The paintings have been described as being of high quality and depict almost exclusively scenes from the Bible (and with the exception only of other religious themes, e.g. the stigmatization of Saint Francis). =Furnishings= The oldest item in the church is the square-shaped baptismal font, of the same age as the church building. Of the church bells, the smaller one is medieval; it was made in the 15th century by a bell-maker named Jakob Jode or Yade in Stralsund. The other furnishings date from the time after the Reformation. The altarpiece is from 1636, probably made in the workshop of Jacob Kremberg in Lund. The pulpit is from the late 16th century. A stained glass window of the church, made in 1936 by artist Hugo Gelin, recounts the legend of Saint Magnhild.

The house was designed in the Victorian architectural style. With It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since December 12, 1976. It was built for a pioneer in 1860, and it later became the home of Peter Remillard and his daughter, Countess Lillian Remillard Dandini. History The house was built in 1860 for James Ashworth, who left his native Kentucky to take part in the California Gold Rush. He subsequently settled in San Jose on 250 acres of land, where he became a farmer and lived with his wife and seven children, until his died in 1895. The property was purchased in 1891 by Peter Remillard, an immigrant from Canada. Remillard had also participated in the California Gold Rush. By 1861, he founded the Remillard Brick Company. After he purchased Ashworth's house in 1891, he established another brick-manufacturing business on the grounds, with several outbuildings. The bricks were used to build many houses and buildings in San Jose until it closed down in 1968. Peter Remillard remodeled and enlarged the farmhouse while maintaining the Victorian style. The house was inherited by Countess Lillian Remillard Dandini. However, the countess had spent only her summers as a child in the house, and she resided at Carolands from 1950 to 1973. In 1968, the house was transferred to Dandini's longtime friend and neighbor, Joseph Covey and his partner, architect, Dick Gilbert. After Gilbert's death in 1997, Covey's health declined and the house was used by transients and homeless people until it was boarded up 10 years later. In 2007, Sue Cucuzza, a brick collector, found the house in disrepair. Cucuzza decided to work with Covey, in order to remove the transient people and to raise money to clean, restore and preserve the home.

Kreibich emerged as the main leader of the revolutionary socialist movement amongst German workers in Bohemia after the First World War. He was a leader of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and a functionary of the Communist International. During the First Czechoslovak Republic, he was elected to parliament thrice (twice to the Chamber of Deputies and once to the Senate). During the Second World War he was part of the exiled Czechoslovak State Council, based in London. After the war he served as Czechoslovak ambassador to the Soviet Union. Youth and war years Kreibich was born in Zwickau on December 14, 1883. Kreibich joined the Social Democratic Workers Party of Austria in 1902. Between 1906 and 1911 he served as the editor of the weekly Freigeist 1906-1911, issued from Reichenau. In 1909 he organized a youth movement in Northern Bohemia, and served as its chairman between 1909-1915. He moved on to become the chief editor of Vorw√§rts, serving in said function from 1911 until the start of the World War. As the First World War broke out in 1914, Kreibich supported Lenin's call against the war. Kreibich did military service between 1915 and 1918. German-Bohemian revolutionary leader Kreibich emerged as a leader of the revolutionary sections in the German- speaking areas of Bohemia. After the war, he became the chairman of the Reichenberg branches of the German Social Democratic Workers Party in the Czechoslovak Republic (DSAP) and its youth organization. He was elected to the Czechoslovak Chamber of Deputies in 1920, standing as a DSAP candidate in the 4th electoral district.N√°rodn√≠ shrom√°≈ædƒõn√≠ ƒçeskoslovensk√© / Poslaneck√° snƒõmovna 1920 ‚Äì 1925. Karl Kreibich The leftwing elements in the DSAP, centered in Reichenberg and led by Kreibich, took part in the December 1920 general strike. The DSAP party leadership issued a statement on January 8, 1921, condemning the Reichenberg party branch for violation of party discipline. The DSAP left responded by declaring their support for the formation of a Communist Party. DSAP expelled its Reichenberg branch on January 17, 1921. The expelled DSAP left founded the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (German Division) in March, 1921. On March 15, 1921, the newly constituted Central Committee of the party elected Kreibich as its chairman. Building the Communist Party Kreibich, along with his colleague Alois Neurath, built the new party with inspiration from the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). Notably, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (German Division) was the first communist party in the new republic, with the Czech Marxist left forming their party only in May 1921. Lenin in particular was pushing for the unification of the communist movement in Czechoslovakia into a single party, a move that the Czech leftists had initially resisted. The German communists had taken a more radical stand than the Czech left leader Bohum√≠r ≈†meral, who for tactical reasons hesitated in forming a new party. ≈†meral sought to gather as many left social democrats as possible before formalizing the split in the Czech social democracy, prompting Kreibich to accuse the Czech Marxist left of being a platform for 'centrists' and 'opportunists'. Drawing from the experiences of the building of the KPD, Kreibich sought to utilize the same approach to ≈†meral's group as the Spartacus League had employed in winning over large parts of the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany. Kreibich represented the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (German Division) at the third congress of the Communist International, held in Moscow June-July 1921. The dispute between the ≈†meral and Kreibich factions was resolved at this meeting, the Comintern instructed that a unified international Communist Party to be formed in Czechoslovakia within three months (which ≈†meral had resisted) whilst Kreibich was reprimanded for 'leftist deviations'. Unification with the Czech left A unification party conference, merging the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (German Division), was held between October 30, 1921 and November 4, 1921. ≈†meral and Kreibich were the main speakers at the event. All 169 delegates at the conference voted in favour of a unified Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, without any distinction of nationality. Kreibich was a member of the politburo of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia until 1924. In Comintern In 1922 he participated in the first and second plenums of the Executive Committee of the Communist International. Between 1924 and 1927 he worked at the Comintern headquarters, serving as the editor Kommunistische Internationale in Moscow. He was re- elected to the Czechoslovak National Assembly in the 1925 elections, representing the 4th electoral district.Poslaneck√° snƒõmovna. Karl Kreibich. In 1927 he returned to Czechoslovakia, retaking his seat in the party politburo, but returned to Moscow again in 1929. Fascism and World War He returned to Czechoslovakia in 1933, become the editor of the daily newspaper Rote Fahne ('Red Banner'). He was elected to the Czechoslovak Senate in 1935. In 1938 he emigrated to London, following the Munich Pact. In spite of his anti-fascist credentials, Kreibich was interned by British authorities due to his German ethnicity for a period. His daughter Ilse was arrested by the Gestapo in Prague and sent to concentration camp. During the Second World War, Kreibich collaborated with Edvard Bene≈°' Czechoslovak government-in-exile. In 1941 he was inducted in the Czechoslovak State Council. As a member of the London- based State Council he took part in approving the controversial Bene≈° decrees, paving the way for mass expulsions of ethnic Germans from Czechoslovakia. Later years He returned to Czechoslovakia in 1945. At the time, Kreibich was an established historian and scholar. In 1948 he became chairman of the Czechoslovak-Israeli Friendship Association. Between 1950-1952 he served as the Czechoslovak ambassador to the Soviet Union. Kreibich fell out of favour with the Communist Party, as he emerged as a major critic of the Sl√°nsk√Ω trial. He was abruptly recalled from his Moscow posting. From 1952 onwards, Kreibich was politically isolated. His biography did not get published, and the Institute of Party History began downgrading his past role as a founder of the communist movement in Czechoslovakia. Kreibich died in Prague on August 2, 1966.

By the end of the 13th century the forms used in the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches had become established, while the Reformation led to changes in Protestant churches from the 16th century onward. Secular origins The vestments of the Catholic Church, East and West, developed out of the various articles of everyday dress worn by citizens of the Greco-Roman world under the Roman Empire. The officers of the Church during the first few centuries of its existence were content to officiate in the dress of civil life, though their garments were expected to be scrupulously clean and of decent quality. The few scattered references in contemporary records to the dress of the clergy all point to this as the only recognized rule. Thus in the 37th of the 4th-century Canons of Hippolytus we read: \\"As often as the bishops would partake of the Mysteries, the presbyters and deacons shall gather round him clad in white, quite particularly clean clothes, more beautiful than those of the rest of the people.\\" Thus, too, St Jerome, in his commentary on Ezekiel xliv. 19, wrote that \\"We, too, ought not to enter the Holy of Holies in our everyday garments ... when they have become defiled from the use of ordinary life, but with a clean conscience, and in clean garments, hold in our hands the Sacrament of the Lord.\\" When, in the year 289, St Cyprian was led to martyrdom, he wore, according to Eusebius,Hist. eccles. iv. cap. 11. an under tunic (linea), an upper tunic (dalmatica, tunica) and mantle (lacerna, byrrus). This was the ordinary type of the civil costume of the time. The tunica, a loose sack-like tunic with a hole for the head, was the innermost garment worn by all classes of Roman citizens under the Republic and Empire. It was either sleeveless (colobium) or sleeved (tunica manicata or manuleata), and originally fell about to the knee, but later on reached to the ankles (tunica talaris). St Augustine said that to wear talares et tunicas manicatas was a disgrace among the ancient Romans, but that in his own day it was no longer so considered in the case of persons of good birth.De doctr. christ. iii. cap. 10, n. 20. The tunica was originally of white wool, but in the 3rd century it began to be made of linen, and from the 4th century was always of linen. About the 6th century the long tunica alba went out of fashion in civil life, but it was retained in the services of the Church and developed into the various forms of the liturgical alb and surplice. The tunica dalmatica was a long, sleeved upper tunic, originating, as its name implies, in Dalmatia, and first becoming fashionable in Rome during the 2nd century; it is the origin of the liturgical dalmatic and tunicle. Another over-dress of the Romans was the paenula, a cloak akin to the current Spanish poncho, a large piece of material with a hole for the head to go through, hanging in ample folds round the body. This was originally worn only by slaves, soldiers and other people of low degree; in the 3rd century, however, it was adopted by fashionable people as a convenient riding or travelling cloak and finally, by the sumptuary law of 382 it was prescribed as the proper everyday dress of senators,Cod. Theod. xiv. 10, 1, de habitu ... intra urbem. instead of the military chlamys, the toga being reserved for state occasions. This was the origin of the principal liturgical vestment, the chasuble. Establishment of form Sant'Agnese in Rome As late as the 6th century the garments described above were common both to the clergy and laity, and, so far as their character was concerned, were used both in the liturgy and in everyday life. Meanwhile, however, a certain development had taken place. By the 4th century the garments worn at liturgical functions had been separated from those in ordinary use, though still identical in form. It is in the 4th century, too, that the first distinctive vestment makes its appearance, the (') worn by all bishops in the East; in the 5th century we find this in use at Rome under the name of pallium, as the distinctive ornament of the pope (see the mosaic image of Honorius I). About the same time the orarium, or stole, becomes fixed in liturgical use. The main development and definition of the ecclesiastical vestments, however, took place between the 6th and the 9th centuries. The secular fashions altered with changes of taste, but the Church retained the dress with the other traditions of the Roman Empire. At Rome, especially, where the popes had succeeded to a share of the power and pretensions of the caesars of the West, the accumulation of ecclesiastical vestments symbolized a very special dignity: in the second quarter of the 9th century the pope, when fully vested, wore a camisia (chemise) girdled, an alb (linea) girdled, an amice (anagolaium), a tunicle (dalmatica minor), a dalmatic (dalmatica major), stole (orarium), chasuble (planeta) and pallium. With the exception of the pallium, this was also the costume of the Roman deacons. By this time, moreover, the liturgical character of the vestments was so completely established that they were no longer worn instead of, but over, the ordinary dress. Hitherto the example of the Roman Church had exercised no exclusive determining influence on ritual development even in the West. The popes had, from time to time, sent the pallium or the dalmaticspecifically Roman vestmentsas gifts of honour to various distinguished prelates. Britain, converted by a Roman mission, had adopted the Roman use, and English missionaries had carried this into the newly Christianized parts of Germany, but the great Churches of Spain and Gaul preserved their own traditions in vestments as in other matters. From the 9th century onwards, however, this was changed, and everywhere in the West the Roman use ousted the regional uses. This change synchronized with the revival of the Western Empire under Charlemagne, a revival which necessarily gave an impulse to the claims of the Holy See. The adoption of the Roman liturgical dress had, however, at most an indirect connection with these claims. Charlemagne was active in prescribing the adoption of the Roman use; but this was only as part of his general policy in the organization of his empire. A renovation of the Galilean Church was not the least crying need; and, in view of the confusion of rites (Gallican, Gothic, Roman, Ambrosian) in the Frankish empire, Charlemagne recognized that this innovation could only be effectually carried out by a closer connection with Rome in ritual as in other matters. Charlemagne's activity in this respect was, in effect, only the completion of a process that had been going on since the 6th century. Whatever effect the reinvigoration of the papacy may have had in hastening the process, the original impulse towards the adoption of the Roman rite had proceeded, not from Rome, but from Spain and Gaul. It was the natural result of the lively interchange between the Churches of these countries and the Holy See. Nor was the process of assimilation by any means one-sided. If Spain and Gaul borrowed from Rome, they also exercised a reciprocal influence on the Roman use. A large proportion of the names of the liturgical vestments are not of Roman origin, and the non-Roman names tended to supersede the Roman in Rome itself. Pre-Reformation development Stigand, Archbishop of Canterbury (1052‚Äì1070), from the Bayeux Tapestry. Note the absence of the mitre, the chasuble short or tucked up in front, the maniple still carried in the left hand. The period between the 9th and the 13th centuries is that of the final development of the liturgical vestments in the West. In the 9th century appeared the Pontifical gloves; in the 10th, the mitre; in the 11th, the use of liturgical shoes and stockings was reserved for cardinals and bishops. By the 12th century, mitre and gloves were worn by all bishops, and in many cases they had assumed a new ornament, the rationale, a merely honorific decoration (supposed to symbolize doctrine and wisdom), sometimes of the nature of a highly ornamental broad shoulder collar with dependent lappets, and sometimes closely resembling the pallium; rarely a \\"breast-plate\\" on the model of that of the Jewish high priest. This elaboration of the pontifical vestments was contemporaneous with, and doubtless partly determined by, the assimilation of the bishops during those centuries to the type of the great feudal nobles whose ambitions and love of pomp they shared. With the evolution of the feudal organization of society, even everyday costume was becoming a uniform, symbolizing in material and colour the exact status of the wearer. It was natural that in the parallel organization of the Church the official vestments should undergo a similar process of differentiation and definition. With this process, which in all its essential features was completed in the 11th century, doctrinal developments had little or nothing to do, though from the 9th century onwards liturgiologists were busy expounding the mystic symbolism of garments which, until their imagination set to work, had for the most part no symbolism whatever. Yet in view of later controversies, the changes made during this period, notably in the vestments connected with the mass, are not without significance. Hitherto the chasuble had been worn by all ministers at the Eucharist, even by the acolytes; it had been worn also at processions and other non-liturgical functions. It was now exalted into the mass vestment par excellence, worn by the celebrant only, or by his immediate assistants (deacon and subdeacon) only on very special occasions. New vestments were devised to take the place, on less solemn occasions, of those hallowed by association with the holy sacrifice; thus the processional cope appeared in the 11th century and the surplice in the 12th. A change, too, came over the general character of vestments. Up to the 9th century these had been very plain, without ornament save such traditional decorations as the clavi of the dalmatic; what splendour they had was due to their material and the ample folds of their draperies. But from this time onwards they tend to become more and more elaborately decorated with embroidery and jeweller's work. Very significant, too, is the parting of the ways in the development of liturgical vestments in the East and West. During the first centuries both branches of the Church had used vestments substantially the same, developed from common originals; the alb, chasuble, stole and pallium were the equivalents of the ('), ('), (') and ('). While, however, between the 9th and 13th centuries, the Western Church was adding largely to her store of vestments, that of the East increased her list by but three, the (') and (') and the ('). The living force of development in the Latin Church was symbolized in her garments; the orthodoxy of the Greek Church in hers. With the exception of the mitre, introduced in the 15th or 16th century, the liturgical costume of the Eastern clergy remains now practically what it was in the 9th century. In the Western Church, though from the 9th century onwards the Roman use had been the norm, considerable alterations continued to be made in the shape and decoration of the liturgical vestments, and in this respect various Churches developed different traditions, as in the chasuble. The definition of their use by the various orders of the clergy in the several liturgical functions, however, was established by the close of the 13th century. The images below illustrate changes up to that time. For centuries thereafter the dress has been essentially unaltered.

In addition to the vestments shown in the image of Bishop Johannes, he wears the archiepiscopal pallium. Protestantism Jakob Damman (died 1591), Lutheran pastor, in black gown and ruff In Protestant Churches the custom as to vestments differs widely, corresponding to a similar divergence in tradition and teaching. At the Reformation two tendencies became apparent. Martin Luther and his followers regarded vestments as among the adiaphora, and in the Churches which afterwards came to be known as \\"Lutheran\\" many of the traditional Catholic vestments were retained. John Calvin, on the other hand, laid stress on the principle of the utmost simplicity in public worship; at the councils in Geneva, the traditional vestments were absolutely abolished, and the Genevan model was followed by the Calvinist or \\"Reformed\\" Churches throughout Europe. An Anglican priest wearing a white cincture around his waist to hold his alb and purple stole in place. The Church of England, in which the Lutheran and Calvinistic points of view struggled for the mastery, experienced a long controversy over the proper use of vestments. In the 20th and 21st century, usual vestments for the Anglican church include the alb with a cincture, and stole, over a cassock (a derivative of the tunic). Eventually the Lutheran Churches of Denmark and Scandinavia retained the use of alb and chasuble in the celebration of the Eucharist (stole, amice, girdle and maniple were not used after the Reformation), and for bishops the cope and mitre. The surplice is not used, the ministers conducting the ordinary services and preaching in a black gown, of the 16th-century type, with white preaching bands or ruff. In Germany the Evangelical Church (itself an outcome of a compromise between Lutherans and Reformed), in general, discarded the old vestments. In Prussia the superintendents now started to wear pectoral crosses, which were instituted by the emperor Wilhelm II. In the Calvinistic \\"Reformed\\" Churches the minister wore the black Geneva gown with bands. This use was largely discontinued in the Free churches. On the other hand, some of these again adopted the surplice, and in one at least (the Catholic Apostolic Church) the traditional Catholic vestments were largely revived.

Much of his music is in the Zydeco style and his cooking primarily focuses on the culture of southern Louisiana. Biography A native of Gastonia, North Carolina, Roy \\"Mel\\" Melton first went to Lafayette, Louisiana, to visit a college friend during the summer and play music before returning to the University of North Carolina. He changed his plans when he fell in love with the rich culture and physical beauty of southwest Louisiana. Melton soon moved permanently to Lafayette and began playing in a band he co-founded with slide-guitar player Sonny Landreth. To help support his musical career, Melton took a series of jobs and eventually discovered a new talent and another part of the Cajun lifestyle: Louisiana cooking. Over the next fifteen years, he honed his musical and cooking skills, eventually becoming a well-known Cajun chef. At the same time, he was becoming known as a singer and a harmonica player who created a Zydeco style of playing that put him in great demand. In addition to playing with Sonny Landreth, Melton was frequently on stage with the King of Zydeco, Clifton Chenier, and spent a year touring with internationally-known Zachary Richard. Melton recorded on Landreth‚Äôs first record, Blues Attack, which also featured C.J. Chenier on saxophone and Buckwheat Zydeco on the Hammond organ. In 1982, Landreth and Melton formed the band Bayou Rhythm, and eventually added C.J. Chenier to the lineup. The band recorded Way Down in Louisiana in 1985. A song on that record ‚ÄúCongo Square,‚Äù was co-written by Landreth and Melton and has since been recorded by The Neville Brothers, John Mayall, Tom Principato and several other artists. Bayou Rhythm toured heavily, headlined national shows and also opened for legendary musicians including Ray Charles, B.B. King, Dr. John, The Neville Brothers, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Dave Edmunds, and The Fabulous Thunderbirds. One of the special attractions of a Bayou Rhythm concert began at the American Music Festival in 1986, when Melton was challenged to a gumbo cook-off with fellow musician Rockin Dopsie. The success of the event led Melton to cook more as part of his bands‚Äô gigs. In 1986, Melton left the band to pursue a full-time chef career in Chicago. In the first month there, as chef at Capers, he won the prestigious Grand Prize at the Rolls Royce/Krug Champagne Invitational Chef Competition. The restaurant was named one of the top ten new Chicago restaurants of 1987. He frequently did cooking demonstrations and appeared on various Chicago radio and television programs. He was also a featured chef at the Chicago Jazz Festival, The American Cancer Society Christmas Gala, and Mardi Gras at the Limelight Club. In 1990, Melton moved back home to North Carolina, where he continued showcasing his cooking skills at numerous events and cooking schools and by opening several restaurants. In 1995, he formed his current band, Mel Melton & the Wicked Mojos, and in 1998 recorded his first CD, Swampslinger, for New Moon Music, a Chapel Hill-based blues label. The CD was named one of the top ten blues CD of the year by The Washington Post. He followed that up with Mojo Dream in 2000, on the Nashville-based Nightfly label, and it was awarded ‚ÄúZydeco Record of the Year‚Äù by Real Blues Magazine. He also authored his first cookbook, Cookie Boy, the Authentic Cajun Recipes of Mel Melton, published by Kartobi Press of Farmington, New Mexico. Melton‚Äôs third album with his band was Papa Mojo‚Äôs Roadhouse, featuring guest appearances by Sonny Landreth and Trisha Yearwood‚Äôs former guitarist, Johnny Garcia, on Louisiana Red Hot Records. The record covers the scale of Louisiana dance hall music, ‚Äúwith rowdy Zydeco and Cajun tunes, swamp bop, juke joint blues and New Orleans funk.‚Äù Music journalist Philip Van Vleck (Billboard, Dirty Linen, Metro), said in Triangle Live: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the best record he‚Äôs ever released because he just keeps getting better instead of older.

There he focused on bringing in first-class original musical talent became a stopping-off point for many acts on tour through the southeast. The food at Papa Mojo‚Äôs Roadhouse was critically acclaimed as being one of the best places for authentic Cajun food outside of Louisiana. In 2008, celebrity television chef Bobby Flay presented Melton with the restaurant's award first place in the casual dining category during the N.C. State Fair. In 2014, Melton closed Papa Mojo‚Äôs Roadhouse to focus on his music and to continue teaching cooking. He frequently plays in North Carolina and Virginia and several of his 2018 shows have featured Piedmont blues legend John Dee Holeman.

On 20 July 1977, the Avia 14 operating this flight crashed into trees outside the airport shortly after takeoff. Thirty-three passengers and all six crewmembers were killed, while one passenger survived. The Air Accident Investigation Commission concluded the cause of the accident was the use of a runway unsuitable for takeoff. Accident At the time of departure the wind was from 120 degrees at 3 meters per second, it was raining and the runway had standing water on it. The pilot in command elected to take off from runway 34 with a quartering tail wind, and to use the left (west) side of the runway as it was drier there. Lined up 35 meters to the left of center, the crew commenced the takeoff. 225 meters from the start of the takeoff run the left main landing gear tires ran over a runway edge marking cone. 120 meters further down the runway the crew rotated the aircraft and 105 meters further ran over another cone. 100 meters further and almost completely off the runway, the right main landing gear tires ran over a third cone. The aircraft was still accelerating with the nose up when a fourth cone was flattened. 945 meters from the beginning of takeoff, the airliner lifted off and flew 185 meters before striking the airport perimeter fence with its tail. Flying another 200 meters at an altitude of 14 meters, the aircraft impacted trees at the edge of a forest, losing part of its left wing tip and outermost aileron. After the impact with trees, the aircraft was able to climb to 25‚Äì30 meters altitude, but after flying 300 meters further with a high pitch angle the aircraft stalled, rolling to the right, pitched over and descended rapidly. Rolled 50‚Äì55 degrees right and at a negative pitch angle of 45‚Äì50 degrees, the aircraft crashed into the forest 500 meters from the end of the runway, 225 meters to the left of center. The impact and post-crash fire killed all on board except a 21-year-old passenger who survived with injuries. Aircraft Construction of the Avia 14 involved, serial number 806109, was completed at the Avia aircraft factory on 28 June 1958 as a 14-32, the 32-seat variant of the Avia 14. Two days later it was purchased by Czech Airlines and registered OK-MCP. On 28 October 1975 the airliner was acquired by the Soviet Union and re-registered as CCCP-52096 to Aeroflot and converted to an Avia 14M. At the time of the accident the aircraft had sustained a total of 20,464 flight hours and 20,467 takeoff and landing cycles. Investigation The Air Accident Investigation Commission placed most of the blame on the captain for deciding to take off from a runway with a large amount of standing water on it and attempting to use only part of the runway. A lack of caution by air traffic controllers in allowing the use of a wet runway with a tail wind and incomplete weather information were also determining factors in the crash.

Water oxidation catalysis (WOC) is the acceleration (catalysis) of the conversion of water into oxygen and protons: :2 H2O ‚Üí 4 H+ \\\\+ 4 e‚àí \\\\+ O2 Many catalysts are effective, both homogeneous catalysts and heterogeneous catalysts. The oxygen evolving complex in photosynthesis is the premier example. There is no interest in generating oxygen by water oxidation since oxygen is readily obtained from air. Instead, interest in water oxidation is motivated by its relevance to water splitting, which would provide \\"solar hydrogen,\\" i.e. water oxidation would generate the electrons and protons for the production of hydrogen. An ideal WOC would operate rapidly at low overpotential, exhibit high stability and be of low cost, derived from nontoxic components. Mechanistic and energetic principles Water is more difficult to oxidize than its conjugate base hydroxide. Hydroxide is stabilized by coordination to metal cations. Some metal hydroxides, those featuring redox-active metal centers, can be oxidized to give metal oxo complexes. Attack of water on metal oxo centers represents one pathway for the formation of the O-O bond, leading to dioxygen. Alternatively, the crucial O-O bond forming step can arise by coupling suitably positioned pairs of metal hydroxo centers. The molecular mechanism of the OEC has not been elucidated. The conversion of even metal hydroxo complexes to O2 requires very strong oxidants. In photosynthesis, such oxidants are provided by electron holes on porphyrin radical cations. For device applications, the aspirational oxidant is a photovoltaic material. For screening WOCs, ceric ammonium nitrate is a typical electron acceptor. Solar panels are the aspirational power sources for driving water splitting, including water oxidation catalysis. Homogeneous catalysis =Ruthenium complexes = A number of ruthenium-aqua complexes catalyze the oxidation of water. Most catalysts feature bipyridine and terpyridine ligands. Catalysts containing pyridine-2-carboxylate exhibit rates (300 s‚àí1) comparable to that of photosystem II. Work in this area has ushered in many new polypyridyl ligands.. The \\"blue dimer\\" {[Ru(bipyridine)2(OH2)]2O}4+ and two derivatives are catalysts (and intermediates) in water oxidation. =Cobalt and iron complexes = Early examples of cobalt-based WOCs suffered from instability.Brunschwig, B.

The intermediate formed reacts with water to liberate O2. The cobalt-polyoxometalate complex [Co4(H2O)2(Œ±-PW9O34)2]10‚àí is highly efficient WOC.Yin, Q.; Tan, J. M.; Besson, C.; Geletii, Y.

Some iron complexes catalyze water oxidation. A water-soluble complex [Fe(OTf)2(Me2Pytacn)] (Pytacn=pyridine- substituted trimethyltriazacyclononane; OTf= triflate) is an efficient WOC. The concentration of the catalyst and the oxidant were found to be strongly affecting the oxidation process. Many related complexes with cis labile sites are active catalysts. Most complexes were found to undergo degradation in a few hours. Higher stability of the molecular catalyst may be achieved using robust clathrochelate ligands that stabilize high oxidation states of iron and prevent rapid degradation of the catalyst. The number and stereochemistry of reactive coordination sites on Fe have been evaluated but few guidelines have emerged.Fillol, J. L.; Codol√†, Z.; Garcia-Bosch, I.; G√≥mez, L.; Pla, J. J.; Costas, M., Efficient water oxidation catalysts based on readily available iron coordination complexes. Nat Chem 2011, 3, 807-813. =Iridium complexes = The complexes [Ir(ppy)2(OH2)2]+ (ppy = 2-phenylpyridine) exhibit high turnover numbers, but low catalytic rates. Replacing ppy with Cp* (C5Me5) results in increased catalytic activity but decreased the turnover number. Water nucleophilic attack on Ir=O species was found to be responsible for the O2 formation. Heterogeneous catalysis Iridium oxide is a stable bulk WOC catalyst with low overpotential. Ni-based oxide film liberates oxygen in quasi-neutral conditions at an overpotential of ~425 mV and shows long lasting stability.DincƒÉ, M.; Surendranath, Y.; Nocera, D.

Perry,\\" Spring, 2017, Trinity College Reporter, retrieved July 17, 2018 Origins, education & early life James Moorhead Perry was born August 21, 1927, in Elmira, New York, and grew up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Perry credited his interest in journalism to the influence of his stepbrother, William H. Whyte, (a reporter for the business magazine Fortune; later author of the best-seller The Organization Man, a prominent book analyzing corporate conformity of the 1950s). At the end of World War II, Perry served in the U.S. Marines. He graduated from Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1950, with a B.A. in English. He worked at the college as news editor of The Trinity Tripod and on the staff of the Ivy. Perry married Margaret Pancoast, September 18, 1954, remaining married until her death in 2011. They had two daughters. Early career Perry began his journalism career at the Marine Corps publication, Leatherneck Magazine. Before his graduation from Trinity, he had been a stringer for the Hartford Courant; but after graduating, went to the rival Hartford Times for what he jokingly described as mercenary reasons‚Äîfor an offer of \\"$45,\\" ten dollars more than offered by the Courant. Perry's subsequent journalism career included work at the Philadelphia Bulletin. National Observer career Starting in 1962‚Äîat the National Observer, a weekly published by Dow Jones‚Äîuntil it closed in 1977. His Observer column \\"Politics by Perry\\" continued for nearly a decade. While working for the Observer, he was present at the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy, and reported on it. As a reporter, he often traveled in the entourage of presidents traveling abroad. Wall Street Journal career After the National Observer ended publication in 1977, Perry became the chief political reporter for America's principal business newspaper: the influential, conservative, New York City-based Wall Street Journal. He continued in that role, eventually rising to an editor, and chief political correspondent, by the time of his retirement in 1997. Journalistic style, values and practices Perry was noted by other journalists for a perceptive, frank, fair and forthright style, relatively free of wild pontificating, and unaffected by others' political gamesmanship and showmanship. Unlike other leading national political reporters of his era, Perry refrained from personal publicity (including television appearances). Perry avoided developing personal relationships with the leaders he reported upon‚Äîbelieving such relationships were contrary to the proper role and perspective of a journalist. Although most of his career was at prominent conservative publications, Perry, himself, was not overtly partisan. However, Perry distrusted and decried ignorance in leaders, journalists and voters, particularly any lack of political literacy or ignorance of history (especially political history).Limpert, Jack, former editor, The Washingtonian, \\"Jim Perry: A Long and Good Life as a Journalist,\\" November 27, 2016, About Editing and Writing, retrieved July 17, 2018.Perry, James M., column: \\"Perry on Politics: The decline of political literacy and the rise of Trump,\\" August 29, 2016, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, retrieved July 17, 2018. Other writings Perry was an early inside analyst and public critic of the U.S. journalistic establishment. He wrote books about the shortcomings of the media, about how poll-driven marketing reshaped American politics, and about costly fiascoes in the military throughout history. As an amateur historian and as an enthusiast about topics of the U.S. Civil War, Mr. Perry returned to book-writing toward the end of his career with the Journal. book reviews: \\"Editor's Shelf,\\" Spring, 2005, Parameters, U.S. Army War College, retrieved July 17, 2018 Following his retirement from the Journal, Perry was a blogger, and wrote commentary on various topics‚Äîsome of which has been used in journalism courses.

It is one of six major islands comprising Solovetsky archipelago. The island is famous for its history and nature. In the prehistoric time this place was used as a sanctuary by the indigenous coastal population. In mid-16th century monks of the Solovetsky monastery organized a transit port on this island that later grew into St. Andrew hermitage. Nowadays the island is a protected territory with historical memorials of various periods. Since 1992 it has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site as a part of Solovetsky monastery complex.  Geography  Bolshoy Zayatsky island is located 2 km southwest from the central island of the archipelago. Its surface is . Just like other islands of this region, it was formed approximately 9000 years ago by the retreating glacier. The island has typical features of tundra landscape however it is located outside of permafrost zone. There are two small hills on either side of the island each 30 meters high.  Archaeological site  Group of stone mounds There is a significant number of man-made stone constructions most notably labyrinths and stone mounds. These constructions are not unique for Bolshoy Zayatsky Island and can also be found on other islands of the Solovetsky archipelago. There are 14 labyrinths on the Solovetsky archipelago and 9 of them are located on the Bolshoy Zayatsky Island alongside more than 600 stone mounds which led researchers think about a particular significance of this place for prehistoric population. Labyrinths are spiral figures made of stone (however with time they became covered with vegetation) from 10 to 25 meters in diameter. There were various hypotheses about the time and purpose of its construction. Most part of researchers connects them with the religious beliefs of the ancient population of the White Sea region. A widely spread version regarded Zayatsky island as a burial site, however, excavation of one of the labyrinth in early 1930s as well as dismantling of several mounds in the 1980s did not give any results to prove it. Another version connected regarded the labyrinth as the entrance marks to the Saiva ‚Äì land of dead in S√°mi mythology. According to the latest hypothesis, only two labyrinths are estimated to be around 2000 years old while other seven were constructed in the late medieval period preceding the foundation of the monastery.  History  = 16‚Äì19th centuries = After the foundation of the Solovetsky monastery the straight between Bolshoy and Maly Zayatsky islands was used by seafarers that waited for a fair wind to enter the Prosperity Bay on the main island. In the mid-16th century abbot Philip (Kolychev) ordered to build a stone harbor to provide shelter for pilgrim and merchant boats. It has been the first and, for more than 150 years, the only stone harbor in Russia. In the same period, a dwelling house and a cook house were put up near the harbor. In 1691 a small wooden chapel was brought to the Bolshoy Zayatsky island from the Bolshoy Solovetsky island. In 1702 the Solovetsky monastery was visited by Peter the Great who at that time was leading a war against Sweden for control over the Baltic Sea. During his 10-day visit he ordered to rebuild the chapel into the church and to consecrate it in the name of Apostle Andrew. According to a legend the St. Andrew‚Äôs flag had been consecrated here before Peter set off for Karelian shore. The St. Andrew church is now the second oldest wooden building on the Solovetsky archipelago. Its appearance combines wooden architecture traditions of Northern and Central Russia. While Peter was on the Solovetsky islands thousands of peasants were building a road through Karelian forest. When the road was finished Peter the Great lead his troops to Onega and then Ladoga lake. In 1702 and 1703 he captured two important Swedish fortresses of Neva River (N√∂teborg and Nyenskans) and founded Peter and Paul fortress that gave birth to the city of St. Petersburg. In 1854 after an unsuccessful bombardment of the monastery English sailors landed on Bolshoy Zayatsky island to replenish supplies of water and food. During one of these landings they plundered the church taking several bells and other church items as souvenirs. In 1912 on the eve of the First World War the bells were returned to the monastery with excuses by an English delegation. = 20th century = Stone labyrinth in winter In 1920 Bolsheviks reached the Solovetsky islands and closed the monastery with all its hermitages. Since 1923 the Bolshoy Zayatsky island became a part of Solovetsky camp of special purpose. The island was used as a penalty prison for women however the information about this period is scarce. From 1922 till 1939 (closure of the camp) the St. Andrew church was a reserve protected by the state. For almost 50 years after the closure of the camp buildings of the hermitage was misused or neglected. Conservation and restoration works started only in early 1990s. At present moment the most part of the restoration works is over. The interior of the church was recreated by the Solovetsky monastery and a new iconostasis was put in 2015. The island doesn‚Äôt have permanent population however during the tourist season two keepers live there (one from the museum and one from the monastery).

The detail of his ownership were complicated and led to complaints being lodged with the Jockey Club. He showed considerable promise as a juvenile in 1886 when he won his first two races before being upset at odds of 1/20 in the Bretby Stakes. In the following year he ran unplaced in the Great Jubilee Stakes and then ran three times at Royal Ascot, winning a Biennial Stakes and finishing second in both the Queen's Stand Stakes and the Rous Memorial Stakes (to Ormonde). In autumn he started favourite for the St Leger and won a controversial race despite being left more than 100 yards behind his rivals at the start. After his retirement from racing he became a successful breeding stallion. Background Kilwarlin was a brown horse bred at the Curragh, County Kildare in Ireland (then part of the United Kingdom) by J. Connolly. During his racing career he was initially owned by Captain Machell who was described as \\"one of the most astute racing men to be found either in England or out of it\\" and was trained by James Jewitt. Machelltypically managed the strategy of his horses careers while Jewitt took care of thei day-to-day conditioning. The details of Machell's acquisition of the horse were unclear but it was reported that he had paid approximately 1,000 guineas. Physically, Kilwarlin was described as \\"a remarkably good looking horse\\" and a \\"grand mover\\". He was sired by Arbitrator, whose biggest wins came in handicap races, was a representative of the Godolphin Arabian sire line,. Kilwarlin's dam Hasty Girl had previously produced the Eclipse Stakes winner Bendigo. Racing career =1886: two-year-old season= Kilwarlin had shown impressive form in training and was highly regarded before he appeared on a racecourse. He made a successful debut in summer when he was an easy winner of the Wynyard Plate at Stockton Racecourse at odds of 1/3. He followed up shortly afterwards by winning the Harrington Stakes. At Newmarket Racecourse in October Kilwarlin started 1/20 favourite for the Bretby Stakes but was beaten by the filly Reve d'Or. His defeat looked more excusable when Reve d'Or defeated Enterprise to win the Dewhurst Plate. Kilwarlin ended the year with earnings of ¬£1,456. =1887: three-year-old season= Captain James Machell, who managed Kilwarlin's racing career Kilwarlin began his second campaign by being matched against older horses in the Great Jubilee Handicap over one mile at Kempton Park Racecourse on 7 May. After racing just behind the leaders he swerved entering the straight, lost his position, and finished eleventh in a race won by his older half-brother Bendigo. At Royal Ascot in June he was matched against the 1886 English Triple Crown winner Ormonde in the Rous Memorial Stakes and finished second, beaten six lengths by his older rival. At the same meeting he finished second to the two-year-old Crowberry in the Queen's Stand Stakes over five furlongs and won the New Biennial Plate. In August Kilwarlin was sold for a reported 7,000 guineas by Machell to George Bridges Harley Dennett Rodney, 7th Baron Rodney. Lord Rodney had inherited a considerable fortune which he exhausted on bloodstock and gambling. On 14 September, at Doncaster Racecourse Kilwarlin was moved up in distance to contest the 112th running of the St Leger over fourteen and half furlongs and despite what was described as \\"wretched\\" weather the race attracted its customary large crowd. Ridden by Jack Robinson he was made the 4/1 favourite ahead of Eiridspord while the best fancied of the other runners were Merry Hampton (winner of the Epsom Derby), Scottish King and Phil (runner-up in the 2000 Guineas). Doubts had been expressed about the colt's effectiveness over the distance with the Sporting Life opining that a sprinter had as much chance of winning the Leger as a snail had of winning the Stewards' Cup. He did however attract considerable support from the large Irish contingent: according to one report a \\"man of knowledge\\" claimed that \\"all Ireland was on\\". Kilwarlin was unruly in the paddock and Robinson opted to abandon the colt's participation in the parade in front of the stands as his behaviour deteriorated. On arrival at the start the colt bucked, kicked and refused to line alongside the others. When the flag fell to start the contest Kilwarlin \\"dug his toes in\\" and refused to race, and the other runners had covered at least 100 yards before Robinson persuaded him to take part. However, the early pace was so slow that he was eventually able to join the main group without Robinson having to rush him. After moving into contention on the final turn, Kilwarlin took the lead a quarter mile from the finish but was immediately challenged by Merry Hampton and Timothy. After what was described as a \\"ding dong\\" struggle and one of the best finishes even seen at Doncaster, Kilwarlin prevailed by half a length from the Derby winner, with Timothy a head away in third place. Lord Rodney rewarded Robinson for his winning ride with a gift of¬£500. The result produced some controversy as Robinon's rival jockeys were criticised for allowing the favourite back into the race instead of setting a faster pace which would have eliminated Kilwarlin from contention. In autumn Kilwarlin was beaten in a \\"private\\" trial race by his stablemate Humewood, but the form of the trial seemed less disappointing when Humewood defeated a strong field to win the Cesarewitch. At Newmarket in October, Kilwarlin was dropped back in distance and won the Challenge Stakes over seven furlongs at odds of 1/3. Kilwarlin's winnings in 1887 came to ¬£5,090. At the end of the year an objection was raised by Merry Hampton's owner \\"Mr Abington\\" to Kilwarlin's St Leger victory on the grounds that he had been entered by his breeder, Mr Connolly who was on the \\"forfeit list\\" for failing to honour financial commitments. It was further alleged that the details of the horse's ownership had been falsified to conceal Connolly's involvement by a complicated series of transactions involving a \\"Mr McKenna\\" and a \\"C L Blake\\". Despite the charges Kilwarlin was allowed to keep the race. Stud record After the end of his racing career Kilwarlin was sold in order to settle Lord Rodney's debts and retired to become a breeding stallion. His best runners included Kilcock (won King's Stand Stakes (twice), Wokingham Stakes, Challenge Stakes (twice) and July Cup), Kroonstad (Ascot Derby), Hebron (Wokingham Stakes), Ogden (Belmont Futurity Stakes), Longford Lad (Grand International d'Ostende), Cherry Picker, (second Eclipse Stakes) and Sabrinetta (second in the Oaks Stakes). He was also the damsire of Glenside (Grand National), St Ninian (Chester Vase) and Samsam (Prix Daru). Several other daughters of Kilwarlin made a lasting impact as broodmares: *Kilmorna was the female-line ancestor of Native River and the Irish 1000 Guineas winner Milady Rose. *Lisdowney, was the female line ancestor of Valdina Myth (Kentucky Oaks) *Navaretta, was a very influential broodmare whose descendants have included Known Fact, Round Table, Pebbles, Nashwan and Deep Impact. Kilwarlin died in October 1900 of an intestinal rupture.

October 2, 1955) is an American differential psychologist and professor of psychology at the University of Edinburgh. She holds the Chair in Differential Development in the Department of Psychology and Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh. Johnson is known for her research on human intelligence and personality. Her career contributions have been honored with several prestigious research awards. She received the American Psychological Foundation Robert L. Fantz Memorial Award for Young Psychologists in 2010. In 2011, she received the American Psychological Association's Award for Distinguished Scientific Early Career Contributions to Psychology, in recognition of \\"innovative research explicating the nature, origin, and consequences of individual differences in intelligence and personality.\\" Johnson was also recognized as a Rising Star by the Association for Psychological Science.  Biography  Johnson grew up in Tacoma, Washington, United States. She graduated from Occidental College in California with a mathematics degree in 1977. In 1991, she founded Pacific Actuarial Consultants, of which she served as president until 2001. She began studying psychology at San Francisco State University in 1995, where she completed a Master of Arts degree in Developmental Psychology in 1999. In 2005, she completed a PhD in Behavior Genetics and Individual Differences, with a minor in Statistics, at the University of Minnesota. At Minnesota, Johnson worked on the Minnesota Twin Family Study, under the supervision of Matt McGue and Thomas J. Bouchard Jr. As a graduate student, Johnson was awarded the 2004 John B. Carroll Award for Research Methodology from the International Society for Intelligence Research. After completing a post-doctoral fellowship at the Minnesota Center for Twin and Family Research, Johnson moved to the University of Edinburgh in 2007. Johnson was supported by a research fellowship from Research Council of the United Kingdom before joining the faculty of the University of Edinburgh in 2010. At Edinburgh, Johnson became involved in longitudinal research with Ian Deary on of the Lothian Birth Cohort. Their research program originated in the Scottish Mental Surveys that tested the intelligence of almost every child born in Scotland in 1921 or 1936, with follow-up studies conducted to the present day.  Research  Johnson's research focuses on genetics, environmental, and social factors that influence the intelligence from childhood to adulthood, and longitudinal relationships between intelligence and other outcomes such as health. Some of her studies have looked a multiple factors in relation to academic achievement over time, including family risk factors, intelligence, depression, and child academic engagement. Her studies utilize quantitative genetic models that specify systematic transactions between genetic and environmental influences on behavior. In some research, twins separated at birth were studied to determine what familial and environmental factors contribute to individual traits, such as intelligence, and if these traits differ if each twin was exposed to different circumstances. Her 2004 paper \\"Genetic and environmental structure of adjectives describing the domains of the Big Five model of personality: A nationwide US twin study,\\" co-authored with Robert F. Krueger, was named Best Paper of the Year by the Journal of Research in Personality. This twin study aimed to specify genetic and environmental influences on Big Five personality traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism). It was determined that Big Five traits have complex etiology with both genetics and outside factors influencing these traits. Some of her work has examined genetic influences on general intelligence, often referred to as g. Her research validates the psychological construct of a higher-level g factor that is not closely associated with any specific test, but rather reflects shared variance across multiple mental ability tests.

It was the first ArenaBowl championship for both teams as they were expansion teams in the previous season. Both teams were owned by Ted Leonsis, giving him his second league championship in six weeks following his Washington Capitals team's victory in the NHL's 2018 Stanley Cup Finals. The title sponsor for the game was Bud Light. The paid attendance was 8,183, the smallest in ArenaBowl history. 2018 playoffs All four AFL teams qualified for the 2018 playoffs. The playoffs consisted of a two-game home-and-home semifinal series with the winners determined by aggregate score. With one week remaining in the 2018 regular season and a then three-way tie for first, the league announced the ArenaBowl would be hosted by the semifinal winner with the higher average attendance through the season instead of using any tiebreakers or home field advantage based on records. The #2 seeded Baltimore Brigade defeated the #3 seeded Philadelphia Soul by a combined score of 110‚Äì86 with Baltimore winning both games, 57‚Äì45 in the first and game two with 54‚Äì41. The fourth-seeded Washington Valor upset the top-seeded Albany Empire by a combined score of 103‚Äì97, where Albany won game one 57‚Äì56 in overtime and game two was won by Washington 47‚Äì40.

The ship's arrival during the Great Depression led to the vessel's financial failure and by 1935, the ship was in limited use. With the onset of World War II, the Royal Canadian Navy acquired the vessel for use as an armed merchant cruiser for protection of western coast of Canada. Upon completion, Prince Robert and her sister ships were the most powerful ships operated by the Canadians until the arrival of larger cruisers later in the war. Converted at Esquimalt, British Columbia and commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy in September 1941, Prince Robert saw its first action along the Mexican coast, capturing the German freighter Weser later that month. Prince Robert then continued patrolling along the Pacific coast of North America, then being sent to Australia to escort troop convoys across the Pacific. Following the entry of the United States into the war in 1941, Prince Robert took part in the naval operations in Alaska alongside its sister ships and . As the threat along the Pacific coast of Canada diminished, a new role for Prince Robert and it was converted to an anti-aircraft cruiser in 1943. Prince Robert returned to service later that year and escorted convoys in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea between the United Kingdom and Naples, Italy, defending them against air attack. In 1944, the ship was transferred to the Pacific once again and was at Sydney, Australia when Japan surrendered. Prince Robert was ordered to Hong Kong to repatriate Canadian prisoners of war and to assist in control of the island. The ship returned to Canada on 20 October 1945 and was paid off on 10 December and transferred to War Assets Corporation for disposal. The ship was sold to private buyers who returned to the vessel to the cargo/passenger trade as Charlton Sovereign in 1948. Charlton Sovereign transported displaced persons and refugees from Europe to locations in Central and South America. In 1951, the ship was sold again and renamed Lucania. Lucania was used a passenger ship between Italy and Venezuela until 1962, when the vessel was sold for scrap. Design and description Prince Robert alongside Vancouver, British Columbia Three passenger/cargo ships were ordered by Canadian National from Cammell Laird for construction in the United Kingdom. Designed by A.T. Wall & Co. of Liverpool as luxury liners with the ability to be converted into armed merchant cruisers, Prince Robert was the last of the three. The ship was long overall with a moulded breath of and a moulded depth of . The vessel's draught was aft. Prince Robert displaced and had a gross register tonnage (GRT) of 6,893 tons and a net tonnage (NT) of 3,072 tons. Prince Robert was propelled by twin screws driven by two Parsons reaction three-stage single-reduction geared turbines rated at at 267 rpm or . These were powered by six water-tube, five-drum, super-heated main boilers and two three-burner Scotch marine boilers for auxiliary power. The ship achieved during sea trials and had a range of at economical speeds or at . The ship had a refrigerated cargo capacity forward and could had accommodation for 334 first class passengers and 70 third class. They could carry 1,500 passengers on day trips. The ship had three decks and an elevator that could move up to two automobiles between them. Prince Robert had an open bridge placed in front of a small, enclosed wheelhouse. The vessel had three funnels and was equipped with six lifeboats per side. Two booms were situated forward over the no. 1 hold. To allow access to jetties of different heights, shell doors were located on each deck. Problems with the design arose after entering service. Their high sides and lack of maneuverability led to them requiring tugboat assistance when entering smaller harbours. Their speed created a tremendous wash that damaged the sea walls in West Vancouver, British Columbia. This led to Prince Robert and its sister ships having to reduce speed to in Burrard Inlet. Service history =Construction and early civilian service= In 1928, the president of Canadian National, Sir Henry Thornton, announced orders for three luxury liners for service on the Pacific coast as part of the effort to re-establish the tri-city route between Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia and Seattle, Washington and to create a new market for Alaskan cruises. Prince Robert was ordered in 1929 by Canadian National for construction by Cammell Laird at their shipyard in Birkenhead with the yard number 966. The third ship of the class after and , the ship was launched on 3 April 1930 and named after Robert B. Teakle, a vice-president of Canadian National. Prince Robert was completed in August 1930 and sailed for the British Columbia Coast. However, Prince Robert was forced to return to Birkenhead after the vessel developed engine troubles. The ship did not enter service until May 1931 and began sailing on the tri-city routes. In July 1931, Prince Robert ran aground near Port Townsend, Washington and was withdrawn from service. By 5 September 1931, the tri-city service was ended and Prince Robert spent most of its time laid up in Vancouver. In 1932 the ship was chartered for extended cruises from Boston, Massachusetts and New York City to destinations such as Bermuda, ports in South America and Hawaii. It was not until 1935 that Prince Robert began seeing more regular service when the ship began to make 11-day cruises to Skagway, Alaska. The 11-day cruises began in Vancouver, stopping in Prince Rupert, British Columbia, Sitka, Ketchikan and Juneau, Alaska, before arriving at Skagway. From November through February each year, Skagway froze over during winter and Prince Robert was laid up for overhaul. The three sister ships were considered economic failures for Canadian National, with their arrival coinciding with the Great Depression. Their failure was one of the contributing factors in the resignation of the president of Canadian National, Sir Henry Thornton. The ships were expensive to operate and did not generate new business. In mid-1939, Prince Robert was chosen to act as a royal yacht during the visit of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth to British Columbia. They embarked aboard Prince Robert at Vancouver and were accompanied by a naval escort to their disembarkation site at Victoria. =Conversion= Prior to the outbreak of World War II, the Royal Canadian Navy offered to the British Royal Navy to convert vessels for their own armed merchant cruisers if they were provided with the armaments. The offer was accepted and the Royal Canadian Navy looked around for ships for possible conversion. Though the \\"Princes\\" were made available, Prince Robert and its sister ships were initially rejected due to their poor range, limited water supply and low top speed. However, after the outbreak of war, there was a shortage of cruisers and destroyers to deter surface raiders, and the conversion of the three vessels was incorporated in the 1939 Shipbuilding Programme. The British Admiralty advised that only two of the ships be converted. Prince Robert was one the two initially chosen. Though intended only for chartering by the Royal Canadian Navy, it was later decided to purchase the vessels outright with Prince Robert acquired for $700,000 in November 1939. The design of the conversion was laid out by the naval architecture firm Lambert, German & Milne of Montreal and work on Prince Robert began on 9 February 1940 at Burrard Dry Dock, Esquimalt, British Columbia with an expected delivery in July. The conversion cost $755,330 and included the trunking of the three funnels into two shorter ones, the installation of four breech-loading Mk VII guns, one on each of the two decks forward and aft. The 6-inch guns had once been provided by the Royal Navy and had once been part of the armament of the s. Two guns were fitted on the upper deck amidships along with light anti-aircraft (AA) machine guns. Two depth charge chutes were placed over the stern, though no anti-submarine warfare (ASW) detection equipment was provided. At full load displacement, the draught increased to . Prince Roberts complement was 241 officers and ratings. =Royal Canadian Navy service= The threat of German surface raiders along the Pacific Coast forced the Royal Canadian Navy to speed up the conversion. When the conversion was completed, Prince Robert resembled the s and were the most powerful vessels in the Canadian fleet until the arrival of larger ships later in the war. Prince Robert was commissioned on 31 July 1940 at Vancouver and was ready for sea trials in September. The Royal Canadian Navy had hoped to keep Prince Robert in Canadian waters as protection for west coast Canadian ports. The British Commander-in-Chief of the America and West Indies Station sought to use Prince Robert along the South American coast to disrupt enemy shipping and it was the latter's plan that became Prince Roberts mission. On 11 September, Prince Robert departed Esquimalt for one day of gunnery trials before sailing south to reinforce the Allied blockade of German ships in South American ports. Prince Robert arrived off Manzanillo, Mexico on 18 September and patrolled the entrance to the harbour. Within the port, the 9,472-ton German merchant vessel was known to be getting ready to sail. Weser was carrying supplies for the and was set to meet up with the raider in the Marshall Islands. On 25 September Weser was spotted departing Manzanillo after dark. The commander of Prince Robert waited until Weser had exited the harbour mouth before placing his ship between Weser and the port, cutting off the German vessel's retreat. Prince Robert followed Weser out to international waters remaining undetected, with the Germans thinking that Prince Robert just another Mexican patrol vessel. Prince Robert moved to seize the German vessel after crossing into international waters, taking the Germans by surprise. The Canadian ship sent a boarding party which was able to prevent the German ship from being scuttled and captured Weser. Prince Robert and Weser then sailed for Esquimalt, where the former German ship was taken into Allied service. Prince Robert returned to patrolling off the west coast of South and Central America until early February 1941 when the armed merchant cruiser was replaced by a British cruiser. Prince Robert was then redirected to escort Australian troop convoys across the Pacific for the seven months, spending September and October in refit at Esquimalt. In November, Prince Robert escorted the troop transport that carried C Force to Hong Kong. C Force was the Canadian contingent for the garrison of Hong Kong. Prince Robert transported 109 members of the Royal Rifles of Canada to Hong Kong. Prince Robert and Awatea arrived at Hong Kong on 16 November and disembarked their troops. On 19 November, Prince Robert sailed for Manila, Philippines, arriving two days later to refuel and replenish before sailing again for home. Prince Robert paused at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii before sailing for Esquimalt on 4 December. On 7 December, the United States Army Transport Cynthia Olsen was sunk south of Prince Roberts location. Prince Robert was ordered to the area to search but found nothing. The armed merchant cruiser arrived at Esquimalt on 10 December. Rumours that Prince Robert had spotted the Japanese fleet that attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December, were denied and proven to be false. After returning to Canada, Prince Robert resumed patrols along the coastal shipping lanes as part of Esquimalt Force. This was done to provide a visual presence of the Royal Canadian Navy and to satisfy the American demand for a credible Canadian naval presence. By May 1942 the ship was overhauled at Esquimalt, receiving plastic bridge armour, ASDIC for ASW detection, and cannon for AA protection. In June the Royal Canadian Navy was informed of the upcoming Aleutian Islands Campaign by the United States. Beginning in May, Prince Robert was placed under Royal Navy control as an escort and patrol ship attached to the New Zealand Station. In August, the Americans requested Canadian support and Prince Robert, Prince Henry, Prince David and two s, and were ordered to join the American fleet at Kodiak, Alaska as \\"Force D\\". Force D arrived at Kodiak on 20 August and were placed in Task Force 8. Prince Robert was primarily deployed to escort convoys between Kodiak and Dutch Harbor, each trip taking roughly seven days followed by a four-day maintenance period. The first convoy Prince Robert sailed with nearly led to an incident. On 27 August, the convoy encountered unknown ships crossing their path. They belonged to another convoy, but this information had not been passed to Prince Roberts commander. As tensions mounted after attempts to communicate failed, a US destroyer moved to intercept the ships and ascertain their identity, which resolved the situation. Force D remained in Alaskan waters until 30 October when they departed for Canada, arriving on . =As anti-aircraft cruiser= As the war progressed, the \\"Princes\\" deficiencies as armed merchant cruisers and the need for newer ship types led to the decision to convert the three ships. Prince Robert was chosen for conversion to an auxiliary AA cruiser for use in air defence for convoys. Prince Robert was taken out of service on 2 January 1943 and converted. The ship's armament was completely changed. The cruiser's main armament consisted of ten quick-firing Mk XVI high-angle/low-angle dual-purpose guns in five twin turrets. Furthermore, the ship was given eight pom-poms in two quadruple mounts and twelve 20 mm Oerlikon cannon. Prince Robert was also given four depth charge throwers. With the conversion, Prince Robert became one of the more powerful AA ships in the war. The ship recommissioned on 7 June 1943 at Vancouver and on 19 June, departed for the River Clyde, via the Panama Canal and Bermuda. While stopped at Bermuda, the vessel's gunnery systems were modified. An AA gun crew aboard Prince Robert in March 1944 On 20 October, Prince Robert was ready for active service, and the following day sailed to join the Mediterranean Fleet to be used as an AA escort for convoys operating between the United Kingdom and Sierra Leone and convoys in the Mediterranean Sea. On 21 November, Prince Robert joined the escort of the joint convoy SL 139/MKS 30. The convoy had previously survived a concerted U-boat assault and the day Prince Robert joined the escort screen, the convoy came under air attack. The Luftwaffe had sent 25 Heinkel He 177 bombers to attack the convoy with glider bombs. During the air assault, one merchant ship was sunk and another damaged. Two German aircraft were shot down. While supporting convoys travelling to Naples, Italy, the ship was tied into the local AA defence of the harbours it was docked in by telephone. In January 1944, Prince Robert was reassigned to Plymouth Command but remained as AA support for convoys travelling to the Mediterranean. After escorting 17 convoys, Prince Robert was withdrawn from European waters in September as the German air threat diminished and transferred once again to the Pacific. Prince Robert departed Plymouth in September, sailing to Esquimalt for another overhaul. Prince Robert recommissioned at Vancouver on 4 June 1945 and sailed for Sydney, Australia on 4 July via San Francisco. At San Francisco, the AA armament was altered, with four twin Oerlikon mounts replaced with four twin Bofors mounts. In early August, Prince Robert joined the British Pacific Fleet. On 15 August, Japan surrendered and Prince Robert was part of Task Group 111.2 sent to secure Hong Kong from Japanese control. Upon arrival on 31 August, Prince Robert sent landing parties to secure the dock area, railyard and train station. Prince Roberts commander represent Canada at the formal surrender of Hong Kong to Allied forces on 16 September. Prince Roberts landing parties were replaced by Marine detachments from . Canadian prisoners of war from the units Prince Robert had ferried over to Hong Kong in 1941 were brought aboard the ship to be transported back to Canada. Prince Robert detached from the British Pacific Fleet and sailed for Esquimalt via Subic Bay and Manila. Prince Robert arrived at Esquimalt on 20 October and was paid off on 10 December 1945. The ship was transferred to the War Assets Corporation for disposal in January 1946 and laid up in Bedwell Bay, at the northern end of Burrard Inlet. =Commercial service and fate= War Assets sold Prince Robert to the Charlton Steam Shipping Company in 1947. The ship was reconverted to a passenger/cargo ship at Antwerp and renamed Charlton Sovereign. The conversion allowed them to carry 750 passengers in eight-berth cabins and 20 to 40-person dormitories. The ship was registered in London and re-entered service in 1948. In May 1948, Charlton Sovereign was chartered for use by the International Refugee Organization to transport displaced persons and refugees from Europe. In August, the ship sailed from Bremerhaven to Sydney, Australia, stopping for a month at Gibraltar to undergo engine repairs. The voyage took 86 days. Charlton Sovereign then made a voyage from Bremerhaven to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, developing engine problems again. Upon return to Europe, the ship underwent two-month refit on the River Tyne. After returning to service, the vessel made trips from Naples, Italy to Rio de Janeiro, Naples to Halifax and Naples to Central America. The ship then sailed pilgrimage routes. In 1951, the ship was acquired by Fratelli Grimaldi, renamed Lucania and registered in Naples. Intended for the emigrant trade, in 1953, the ship underwent significant reconstruction, being lengthened to overall and the gross register tonnage decreasing to 6,723 tons. The bow was lengthened and the funnels replaced and moved. Lucania could accommodate 90 first-class passengers, 90 intermediate and 560 tourist passengers. Sailing between Italy and Venezuela, Lucania remained in service until 1962. On 15 March 1962, Lucania was sold for scrap to G. Riccardi and broken up at Vado Ligure, near Livorno, Italy.

The town's 1920 census showed 182 residents and the town included businesses such as a cider shop, grocery store, and the Laurel Lumber Company.ftp://ftp.census.gov/library/publications/decennial/1920/bulletins/demographics/population- de-number-of-inhabitants.pdf In early 1927, two bills began circulating in the Delaware General Assembly to merge the towns of North Laurel and Laurel. The first bill was written to cancel the town of North Laurel's charter and the second bill would concurrently annex the land formerly in North Laurel into the Laurel town limits. The 1927 attempt to merge the two towns failed when the residents of North Laurel voted against the proposal in April, prompting the entire town council to refuse to serve another term. Two years later, in March 1929, the Delaware General Assembly again passed bills allowing for North Laurel to cancel their charter and for Laurel to annex the former town if the residents of both towns voted in favor of the proposal. On March 29, the two towns voted to merge, with the ballots being 39 to 18 in favor of merging in North Laurel and 78 to 11 in favor of merging in Laurel. The properties in the former town of North Laurel were turned into the fourth ward of Laurel and an election was held on April 26 to give representation to the area on the Laurel town council, bringing an end to the merger.

The campaign can be divided into 3 stages: the White offensive (June 6 ‚Äì July 3), trench warfare around the Kakhovka Brigdehead (August 20 ‚Äì October 27) and the counterattack of the Red Army (October 28 ‚Äì November 3).  Prelude  On April 4, the defeated Anton Denikin transferred the post of the commander of the AFSR to General Pyotr Wrangel. Having reformed the remnants of the AFSR into a 25,000-strong army, Wrangel gave her the name Russian Army. The operational action plan for the South Western Front of the Red Army in the second half of June 1920 was as follows: * the 13th Army, located on the right bank of the Dnieper was to develop an offensive from the area Berislav in the general direction Kakhovka - Perekop. * Ivan Fedko's group (30th, 46th and 15th divisions, 2nd infantry brigade and two brigades of the 23rd Infantry Division), deployed at the Sherebets-Orekhov-Pogoly front, was to strike in the direction of Melitopol. The actions of these two groups had to bind the enemy's main forces. At this time, the mounted group under command of Dmitry Zhloba, concentrated on June 27 in the area of the Husark ‚Äì Popovka ‚Äì Belmanka ‚Äì Tsarekonstantinovka, aimed at Melitopol. The group was composed of the 1st Cavalry Corps (3800 sabers under Dmitry Zhloba), the 2nd Stavropol Cavalry Division (1340 sabers under Pavel Dybenko) and two cavalry brigades of the 40th Division (1,500 sabers).  Destruction of the Red 1st Cavalry Corps (29 June ‚Äì 3 July)  On June 28, the cavalry group Zhloba broke through the front of the Don Corps and took Chernigovka. On the next day, they advanced further in the general direction of Pragenau-Astrakhanka. At the same time, the White Army pulled large infantry forces into the area to surround the cavalry group Zhloba from the north and the south. The total number of forces allocated to the encirclement of the Red cavalry reached 10,000‚Äì11,000. On the dawn of July 3, the White units went on the offensive to encircle and finally eliminate the Red cavalry of Zhloba. The aviation of the Russian Army also inflicted heavy losses on the Zhloba corps. On July 3, 1920, General Morozov dealt the final blow to the already smashed corps of Zhloba. As a result of this brilliant victory, the Russian Army of Wrangel was able to seize the strategic initiative and continue the offensive against Yekaterinoslav and Southern Little Russia. The large losses of the Red Army troops forced them to retreat. The supporters of the White movement had regained the hope of winning the war. By the mid-July the White Army had seized Northern Taurida.  Kakhovka Bridgehead  To stop the Whites, the Revolutionary Military Council of the RSFSR issued an order to establish the Southern Front under the command of Mikhail Frunze. In August 1920, Ieronim Uborevich was ordered to establish a bridgehead over the Dnieper River at Kakhovka. The Kakhovka bridgehead was created on August 7, 1920, when units of the 15th, 52nd and Latvian Rifle Divisions of the 13th Army successfully forced the Dnieper in the area of Alyoshka ‚Äì Korsunsky Monastery. The total area of the bridgehead was , with a depth of , and was supplied through 4 ferries at the village of Bolshaya Kakhovka. A bridgehead at a distance of from Perekop posed a serious threat in the rear of the White Guard troops in Northern Taurida. Immediately the construction of fortifications in three defensive lines began and was completed on October 13, 1920. Between August 12 and October 28, the Kakhovka bridgehead became the site of fierce battles, with failed attacks and counterattacks, and heavy casualties on both sides, \\"probably the closest the Civil War came to world war trench fighting.\\"Evan Mawdsley, The Russian Civil War (Edinburgh: Birlinn, 2008), p. 268. Assistance was provided to the Red Army by the actions of Red Partisans and spontaneous insurrections of the population in the rear of the White troops.  Red offensive  On October 12, 1920, a truce was concluded between Poland and Soviet Russia. This enabled the Red Army to hastily move troops from the Polish front to Southern Ukraine. Thus, numerical superiority of the Red Army over the Russian army was created. On October 28, the Southern Front launched a counteroffensive and, by November 3, was able to defeat the White Army in Northern Taurida.  Aftermath  Wrangel's troops retreated to the Crimea. On November 7, Soviet troops launched a new successful offensive (the Perekop-Chongar operation). On November 17, the White Army evacuated the Crimea and the war on the Southern Front came to an end.

Trace was best known as the author of What Ivan Knows that Johnny Doesn‚Äôt (1961), published by Random House during the Sputnik era, at the height of the Cold War with the Soviet Union. In this book, he sought to upend the then commonly held opinion that although the United States seemed to lag behind the Soviet Union in the teaching of science and mathematics, it was superior in the teaching of the humanities.'' Professional life Trace's book What Ivan Knows that Johnny Doesn‚Äôt offered its readers a comparison of American and Soviet public school textbooks adopted in these two countries at the time, and the comparison was not favorable to the American education system. Directed to a popular audience, Trace‚Äôs book, together with a book published previously by Rudolf Flesch called Why Johnny Can't Read (1955), spurred an immediate public interest and national debate surrounding perceived inadequacies of educational methods then being used in the American public education system in the teaching of reading, history, literature, foreign languages, and geography. According to Trace, textbooks used in the United States public schools to teach reading and the humanities were constrained by the theory that children would learn better and more easily with controlled and repetitive content and, in the teaching of reading, a limited vocabulary focused mainly on familiar life-adjustment themes common in American suburban life, rather than truly literary content that provokes thought and encourages imagination beyond everyday life. Thus, Trace felt that very little good literature was offered in these textbooks. Moreover, much less challenging content in the teaching of history, foreign languages, and geography eventually became the norm. According to Trace, textbooks in the Soviet Union, by contrast‚Äîalthough fettered by Communist ideology‚Äîdid not limit vocabulary or content but offered a more common-sense approach to educational content with rich and imaginative literary fare, including stories by Tolstoy and Gogol even in the lower grades, as well as substantial, challenging, and informative subject matter in ancient and modern history, modern languages, and geography in all levels of learning. What Ivan Knows that Johnny Doesn‚Äôt was widely reviewed throughout the country, including in feature articles in the Saturday Evening Post,\\"Can Ivan Read Better than Johnny? Saturday Evening Post (May 27, 1961): 30 The New York Times,‚ÄúRussian Readers Called Superior,‚Äù The New York Times (October 27, 1961) Time Magazine,‚ÄúWhat Ivan Reads,‚Äù Time Magazine (November 17, 1961) the Cleveland Plain Dealer,‚ÄúIvan v.s.

Trace also appeared in several media venues, including numerous local radio shows around the country, as well as a major national talk show, ‚ÄúHoward K. Smith‚ÄîNews and Comment‚Äù (February 14, 1962), in which he appeared with Edward R. Murrow on the show‚Äôs debut. Not surprisingly, the books by Flesch and Trace, as well as Trace‚Äôs subsequent book Reading Without Dick and Jane (1965), rankled the educational establishment, which responded in various critical reviews and journal articles, defending the schools and the training received by teachers in colleges of education around the country and criticizing other aspects of Soviet education besides its textbooks.For example: Renfield, Richard L.,‚ÄùIvan Doesn‚Äôt Learn More than Johnny‚Äù New York Times, 11 Nov 1962: 247; Albert J. Harris, ‚ÄúIvan and Johnny: A Critical Review,‚Äù The Reading Teacher Vol. 16, No. 3, Johnny Can Read (Dec., 1962): 151-157. Yet, as a result of the revelations outlined in Flesch‚Äôs and Trace‚Äôs books, despite the controversy they sparked, some Americans (as evidenced in the numerous reviews in newspapers and magazines of What Ivan Knows that Johnny Doesn‚Äôt) became fearful of the inadequacies of the public schools and their curriculum. Concern grew that educational outcomes could be seriously compromised, possibly jeopardizing the cultural status of the United States and even its national security during the Cold War era. In Reading Without Dick and Jane, Trace investigated in further detail the methods of teaching reading in public schools at the time, making the case, as did Flesch, for the superiority of the phonics method‚Äîbased on knowing how letters and letter combinations typically sound‚Äîover the then widely adopted ‚Äúlook- say‚Äù method (or, as Trace called it, the ‚Äúlook-guess‚Äù method), which relies on raw memorization of how words look. Trace pointed out that reading experts increasingly discarded the phonics method and approved of a reading method that exerted more control over vocabulary and slowed down the pace of content in order to make reading easier and more accessible to students. Like Flesch, Trace believed that the phonics approach allowed students to discover for themselves any new words they encountered and thus to build their arsenal of vocabulary and spelling skills easily and rapidly. Trace felt, therefore, that the then-famous and heavily used Dick and Jane series of readers‚Äîusually taught through the look-say method‚Äîseemed to foster what he deemed to be a mystifyingly illogical and deliberate holding back of learning possibilities. In an attempt to counter such disturbing trends, as he saw them, he edited in 1963-64 a series of elementary school readers published by Open Court Publishing Company.Reading is Fun (1963), Our Country (1964), A Magic World (1964), A Trip Around the World (1964) In them he hoped to offer students a wide selection of imaginative stories, tales about other countries, poems by famous poets, and information essays that he felt could challenge students and that also offered new knowledge and interesting insights about the world. Although these basal readers were adopted by numerous schools (mostly private) around the country and found some success, they ultimately failed to thrive amid criticism among educators that they were too difficult for students.See Henderson, Harold. Let‚Äôs Kill Dick & Jane: How the Open Court Publishing Company Fought the Culture of American Education, St. Augustine Press, 2006. During the 1960s, Trace served as a member of the national Reading Reform Foundation as well as the Council for Basic Education. He was also active in the lecture circuit giving addresses at numerous schools and PTA groups around the country. Although Trace was most well known as an educator and education critic/reformer in his day, he also authored several other books on a wide variety of topics that interested him, including Russian literature, the teaching of foreign languages, the future of literature, the history of Christianity, and famous world historical figures. Personal life Arther Trace was born in Denver, Colorado, in 1922. He earned a bachelor's degree in English at Denver University and then served in the army during World War II. After the war, he attended graduate school at Columbia University, receiving a master's degree in English. He was married in 1949 to Gladys Pickett when he was an instructor at the University of Nebraska. After moving to Palo Alto with his family, he received a Ph.D. in literature at Stanford University in 1954. After earning his doctorate, Trace became an English instructor at Purdue University and shortly afterwards was hired as an English professor at John Carroll University in Cleveland, Ohio, where he taught Renaissance and Russian literature for thirty-five years and published his most well-known books. In 1992, Trace retired and with his wife moved to Fayetteville, Arkansas. There he authored and revised several more books. He died in Fayetteville in 2005 at age eighty-three.

Background Disraeli started work on his final novel in late 1880, a few months before his death in April 1881. It ends mid-sentence one paragraph into its tenth chapter. The work was first published in 1905 in The Times 24 years after Disraeli‚Äôs death and was entitled Falconet since Disraeli usually named his novels after their main character. Plot Joseph Toplady Falconet is the third son of the owner of a successful bank. He is determined to uphold religious traditionalism and talks too long and earnestly, sometimes on rumours which turn out to be untrue (such as the return of the slave trade in the Red Sea). Disraeli in 1878, a few years before he wrote \\"Falconet\\" Early in the novel an unknown middle-aged gentleman takes a hackney carriage journey from the London port to a hotel accompanied by a buddhist called Kusinara whom he has met on the voyage and who has come to England to investigate reports that it is in decline. Arriving on a Sunday when the streets are deserted, he is pleasantly surprised. The novel then introduces Lady Claribel Bertram who is a remarried widow. Lord Bertram has a son from his first marriage, Lord Gaston, who got expelled from public school, university and a foreign embassy before becoming an MP, which position he also quit. He holds radical views which were starting to influence Lady Bertram, until she became acquainted with Gaston‚Äôs successor as MP, Falconet, who visits her regularly to expound his views at length. A neighbour of Falconet's father dies and his brother, Mr Hartmann, and niece come to live in the deceased‚Äôs home. Falconet's parents are concerned that Mr Hartmann is not a churchgoer. Mr Hartmann is an acquaintance of the unknown gentleman and Kusinara and shares the view that mankind needs to be eradicated and that a vehicle for achieving this is religion. At a ball Lady Bertram is approached by an elegant man saying that the hostess (Lady Clanmore) has asked him to attend her. The gentleman says that his friends admire her, respect her views and that she could in some sense lead them. Lady Bertram has no idea what he is talking about but, out of vanity, plays along. When Lady Clanmore approaches, the gentleman disappears and it transpires that nobody knows his identity. The novel ends in describing how Kusinara is well acquainted with the Falconets. Reception A review of the novel appeared in The Spectator when the incomplete work was finally published in 1905. Although complimentary about some aspects of the novel (such as its ‚Äúamazing facility in portraiture‚Äù and its ‚Äúpeculiar brand of epigram of which Disraeli alone had the secret‚Äù) the reviewer was overall disappointed since Disraeli‚Äôs ‚Äúwisdom and acumen had ebbed,‚Äù resulting in, ‚Äúthe comic spirit [being] a little weary.‚Äù Disraeli‚Äôs biographer Robert Blake, however, wrote that, ‚Äúthe novel shows no signs of failing talent‚Ä¶.and one can only regret that it was never finished.\\" Analysis Falconet is generally regarded as a cruel parody of Disraeli‚Äôs long-time political rival William Gladstone. Falconet shares with Gladstone his religious fervour, intelligence and oratorical style but is described as ‚Äúessentially a prig‚Äù, ‚Äúarrogant and peremptory‚Äù and having ‚Äúa complete deficiency in the sense of humour‚Äù. It has also been suggested that Lady Bertram was \\"one more memory of Lady Palmerston\\" and that the character of Hartmann, a nihilist, was inspired by the assassination of Tsar Alexander II of Russia which took place whilst Disraeli was writing the novel.

She was used for most of her career to bring German immigrants to Baltimore. History In January 1867, the North German Lloyd company proposed regular service between Bremen, Southampton, and Baltimore. To that end, the company placed an order with Caird & Company for two large screw steamers for this new line. The keel of Baltimore was laid in March 1867. The ship was launched on 3 August 1867 and was named Baltimore by Mrs. Robert Blair of Haylee. At the time, a reporter from The Glasgow Herald wrote \\"The Baltimore is the forerunner of the fleet, and, judging from her beautiful model, the completeness of her arrangements, and the enterprise of the company to who she belongs, there can be no doubt she will speedily establish for the company a trade as extensive and prosperous as the Bremen and New York fleet, built by the same eminent builders.\\" On 12 February 1868, the Baltimore left the builder's shipyard for Bremen. The Bremen-Baltimore line opened on 1 March and on 3 March the Baltimore set sail from Bremen for Southampton and sailed from Southampton on 4 March for her first transatlantic trip. The Baltimore arrived at the Locust Point dock on the south side of Baltimore Harbor on 23 March. She was only the second iron steamship ever in port. The people of Baltimore marked the arrival of the steamer on her first sailing on 26 March with a parade headed by the Governor with state and local dignitaries, Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery, and local groups as well as celebrations, closing of public schools and markets, and a public holiday. The War Department ordered a salute fired from Fort McHenry as a national recognition of the arrival of the first North German Lloyd steamer. Death of two captains SS Baltimore had an unusual occurrence. Both of her first two captains died at sea between Bremen and Baltimore. The ship's first captain, Captain Wilhelm V√∂ckler (also spelled Voeckler; age 50 of Bremerhaven) died on 8 March 1871. Baltimore had left Bremen on 2 March and Southampton on 5 March. Captain Voeckler had been ill prior to sailing, with dropsy (edema) of the stomach, but was feeling better and insisted on making the voyage. He succumb to his illness and passed away after four days at sea on 8 March. The first officer, Captain Theodor Deetjen, assumed command for the remainder of the voyage and Baltimore sailed in to port with her colors half-mast. Captain V√∂ckler was buried at sea. Captain Carl Fischer (age 37, native of the Kingdom of Hanover) died 26 April 1872, just as Baltimore was entering Cape Henry, Virginia and the day before arriving at the port of Baltimore. Baltimore sailed from Bremen on 10 April and from Southampton on 13 April. Captain Fischer had been quite sick during the passage, but attended to his duties. On 26 April, he had a stroke and died within moments. The first officer, Captain Deetjen, once again assumed command and Baltimore sailed in with her colors half-mast. Captain Fischer was buried at Greenmount Cemetery in Baltimore, Maryland. Collision On the night of 22 May 1872, the steamer Baltimore, under command of Captain Deetjen, was leaving Southampton heading for Bremen with about 120 passengers and cargo aboard. Mid-channel Baltimore collided with the Spanish screw steamship Lorenzo Semprum off the coast of Hastings, England. According to one account, Baltimore was \\"run down\\" by the other ship. The other steamer kept course without stopping to render assistance. The collision left a large hole, long and wide, in the bow causing the forward compartment to be filled with water. The equipment on Baltimore used to lower the lifeboats would not work, but passengers and crew were rescued by the ten men of the Hastings Coastguard. The leak was stopped and the water was pumped out of the hold with the assistance of steam fire engines. The ship was towed by steam tugs to Southampton and put into the dock for repairs. The Spanish steamer put in to dock at Southampton for repairs on 25 May 1872. They also had considerable damage, but had no injuries and the cargo was undamaged. Sailings Baltimore sailed under 14 official captains (V√∂ckler, Fischer, Lillenhain, Andressen, Dehle, Limon, Hellmers, Kohlmann, Hagemann, Bauer, Kessler, Thumann, Reimkasten, and Hashagen) and one unofficial captain (Deetjen). Baltimore sailed from Bremen to Southampton to Baltimore 51 times; the first trip was on 3 March 1868 and the last trip was on 5 March 1884. Baltimore sailed once from Bremen to New York on 11 April 1880. Baltimore also sailed from Bremen to various South American ports 47 times; the first trip was on 12 September 1880 and the last trip was 25 December 1893.

He is a former member of the Ukrainian parliament (Verkhovna Rada) (2014‚Äì2019). and was the subject of an assassination attempt in part because of his actions. Biography When Arsen Avakov became the Minister of Internal Affairs in 2014, Herashchenko became his adviser. In this role, Herashchenko briefed journalists about the formation of the Donbas Battalion, the Azov Battalion, and the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. Herashchenko was elected to parliament in the 26 October 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election, representing the People's Front in a multi-mandate nationwide district. He was secretary of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine Committee on Legislative Support of Law Enforcement. Herashchenko was one of the founders of a database called \\"Peacemaker\\". This is the main Ukrainian and international database used for searching for terrorists. He is also known for open anti-Russian views. In January 2017, it was announced that the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) had prevented an assassination attempt against Herashchenko. The SBU had had the two assassins under surveillance for over a month and arrested them in the act with an explosive device in their possession. The SBU stated that the assassins had been in prison in the Russian-occupied Crimea, until they agreed to assassinate Herashchenko. The SBU claim that the assassins were coordinated by Andrey Tikhonov.

The Association is a non-profit organisation, whose declared goals are to \\"serve as an umbrella organisation for the high-tech and life sciences industry in Israel, including individuals and companies engaged in research, development and marketing in high-tech fields, to investigate, initiate, develop and support policies and actions that will advance the high-tech and life sciences industry in Israel\\". Amongst the occupations of the organisation: Promote technology education (STEM), help solve the shortage of skilled human resource and encourage global tech companies (MNCs) to open research and development centres in Israel. The association has set a goal of integrating segmental populations (such as women, Ultra Orthodox Jews and Arabs) into Israeli high- tech and increasing diversity. The association operates committees of industry leaders to promote various industrial and social issues. The main committees are: the Venture Capital Funds Committee, the Lawyers and Accountancy Committee, the Life Sciences Committee, the Government Relations Committee, the HR Committee, the IP Committee, the Conferences Committee and the Intellectual Property Committee. Establishment of the organisation The Israeli Association for Advanced Industries was established as a merger of the High Technology Industry Association (HTIA) and the Israeli Life Science Association (ILSI), at the initiative of the then chairmen of the two unions. The official launch took place on 17/01/2012 and on 04/06/2012 of that year the association was registered with the Registrar of Associations. At the launch, Adv. Karin Mayer Rubinstein was appointed to the position of CEO of the union, and it was reported that the former chairmen will continue to serve as chairpersons until the chairmen are elected for a period of three years. On 26/07/2012, internal elections were held for the first time. After the previous chairpersons resigned and did not stand for election, Yoav Chelouche was elected as chairman of the high-tech sector, and Dr. Benny Zeevi was elected chairman of the field of life sciences. Since then, elections have been held every three years, in which two chairpersons are chosen for joint ventures in the field of high-tech and the field of life sciences. In addition, the members of the board of directors are chosen according to a key representation of sub-sectors in the industry, and they meet quarterly. In the board of directors that elected on 26/09/2015 included, for the first time, a male and a female representatives from the ultra-Orthodox sector. Areas of activity As part of its business development and marketing, and support activities for young companies, the Association holds annual conferences and professional seminars designed to establish contacts and cooperation, as well as host delegations of global entities. The Forum of Directors of the research and development of International Companies operating in Israel, which operates under the auspices of the Association, serves as a focal point for cooperation between global technology corporations and the relevant bodies in Israel. The Association represents the high-tech industries of the political and professional echelons of government ministries and Knesset (The Legislative Authority in Israel) committees, such as the Ministries of Finance, Treasury, Education and more as well as local authorities and academic institutions. In this framework, the association initiated synchronises and integrates the ecosystem, for example by initiating joint projects with the Israeli government, including the Israeli Cyber Championship, which took place in 2015, and a competition to identify start-ups in high schools, under the auspices of the Ministry of Education. Another long-term project concerns encouragement of local institutional investments in Israeli tech companies. The Association is a partner in programs for rapid training of engineers and programmers in response to a shortage of high-tech workers, according to a business model of cooperation between government agencies and the Innovation Authority and the business sector, a model approved by the Council of Innovation in July 2017. Apart from these, the association produces reports on the state of Israeli technology. Among other things, the Association published a report on the information technology industry in Israel in 2015; Israel Life Sciences Report for 2018; A report on the contribution of venture capital funds to Israeli high-tech, as well as a report on tax policy changes for global technology corporations, in accordance with the OECD's BEPS (Base Erosion and Profit Shift Project) Tax for foreign investors on their investments in Israeli venture capital funds, and a report describing the shortage of skilled manpower in Israel's technology industries.

It was discovered by astronomer √âdouard Stephan on March 23, 1884. The galaxy is a member of the Leo Cluster. Physical characteristics Deep imaging of NGC 3859 by Yagi et al.have revealed a distorted faint halo which is elongated toward the northeast along the major axis of the galaxy. On the southwestern side of the galaxy, the halo is extends about ~ above the disk of the galaxy. To the north, there is a small dwarf galaxy which is possibly an interacting companion. A part of the extended halo of NGC 3859 may be the result of an interaction between the dwarf and NGC 3859. =HŒ± emission= The bright disk HŒ± emission in the disk together with the very blue color of the galaxy and the emission line dominated nuclear spectrum indicate that NGC 3859 is a starburst galaxy. The morphology of the HŒ± emission of NGC 3859 is peculiar is characterized by two narrow spurs which extend to the northwest and the southeast from the galaxy disk and whose widths are ~ and ~ respectively. The morphology and size of the two spurs of NGC 3859 are quite similar to the HŒ± nebula and extended ionized gas cloud which suggest that the spurs originated in a starburst superbubble or superwind. The northern part of an HŒ± nebula of NGC 3859 seems to be flowing toward the northeast. Also, the two spurs of the galaxy also are bending in the same direction. These morphological characteristics suggest that the hot gas of the galaxy is being affected by ram pressure from the southwest. However, there is no indication of one-sided elongation of ionized gas within the galaxy. There is also no sharp cutoff at the southwest edge of the HŒ± nebula, and no extended part of the HŒ± emission out of the galaxy to the northeast, but shows an extension toward east-southeast. In addition, the northern faint flowing part of the nebular continuum is overlapped by the dwarf companion galaxy suggesting that this part of the HŒ± nebula could have been formed by a galaxy interaction rather than ram pressure. Therefore, ram pressure stripping may not be strong enough to create the overall structure of the extended ionized gas cloud (EIG) around NGC 3859.

Education and career Magenheimer joined the Austrian Army as an officer candidate in 1961 after his matura at the Bundesrealgymnasium Wien V in Margareten. From 1962 to 1965, he was enrolled in officer's training at the Theresian Military Academy but did not graduate with a degree. Magenheimer then enrolled at the University of Vienna in 1965 and, four years later in 1969, wrote his dissertation at the Department of Contemporary History under and Heinrich Appelt as his advisers. In October 1972, Magenheimer became a Referent at the Vienna 's Institute for Basic Strategic Research and, until 2000, became a Hofrat and deputy head of the Institute's research department. In 1982 he became a lecturer of military policy at the University of Salzburg, where he would complete his habilitation in 1991. That same year, Magenheimer became a professor of international relations and contemporary and military history at the University of Salzburg's Department of Political Science and Sociology. Since 1975, Magenheimer has published articles in various history periodicals such as the Austrian Military Journal, where since 1985 he has been on the editorial board. He is the author the history series Deutsche Geschichte - Europa und die Welt, published by right-wing publishing company . Controversies Magenheimer has argued that the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact of 1939 was disadvantageous to Germany, a view that Austrian historian Alexander Pollack criticized in his 2002 book Die Wehrmachtslegende in √ñsterreich. In his 1995 work Kriegswenden in Europa 1939-1945 Magenheimer contended that, until the summer of 1940, the Nazi Party had \\"developed a suitable recipe for the political and economic reorganization of Europe in the sense of a universally satisfactory understanding between nations,\\" that Germany's attack on the Soviet Union had \\"opened the door to the unknown,\\" and the Battle of Moscow could have been won if the Wehrmacht had attacked ten days before the Soviet counterattack. An observer in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung criticized Magenheimer for welcoming more lasting German victories and for regarding it as a \\"European law enforcement agency\\" despite its invasions of Poland, France, and the Low Countries in 1939 and 1940. In 2005, Magenheimer portrayed the Wehrmacht as fighting a \\"heroic and legitimate defensive battle\\" against the Red Army in the last years of the Second World War, particularly the evacuation of refugees from East Prussia in 1944‚Äì45. Historians dismissed the notion, pointing out that Nazi propaganda and obstructions prevented a larger evacuation. Magenheimer appeared publicly to criticize both versions of the Wehrmacht Exhibition. He is partly responsible for the lack of criticism by the Austrian Armed Forces of their participation in the Shoah since 1945. He has written a festschrift in honor of British Holocaust denier and revisionist David Irving, written a piece on the air war since refuted by Gerd R. Uebersch√§r, and has advocated for revisionist historiography in the right-wing newspaper Junge Freiheit, leading to his consideration as a representative of the Neue Rechte. Magenheimer has maintained that the Iraq War was a war of aggression by the United States spun as a preventive war that broke international law enshrined in the UN Charter. He judged preventive war as justifiable, but that America's invasion was an unfit response for the threat of weapons of mass destruction and international terrorism. =Preemptive strike myth= Since 1990, Magenheimer has consistently postulated the theory Stalin planned an attack on Nazi Germany before June 1941, which was superseded by Operation Barbarossa. In 1991, he referred to a concept paper on the \\"strategic deployment of Soviet forces\\" from 15 May 1941 that he discovered when the Soviet archives were opened in 1990. He published the paper in the √ñsterreichische Milit√§rische Zeitschrift along with an essay by Russian military historian Valeri Danilov that attributed corrections made in pencil lead to then Georgy Zhukov and alleged that he authorized the plan. He first proposed the idea in his 1969 dissertation, making Magenheimer among the earliest proponents of the myth. He is thus considered the main proponent of the theory and has been cited by , Wolfgang Strau√ü, Joachim Hoffmann, Werner Maser, Ernst Nolte, Franz W. Seidler, and .

Life  Christiane Magdalena Elisabeth Keilholz was born in Pirna, a mid-sized town a short distance up-river from Dresden.Her father was the actor Philipp Christian Keilholz (1735‚Äì1800). It may have been as a result of her parents' theatrical backgrounds that she made her stage debut in 1769, the year of her fifth birthday. While she was growing up she made repeated stage appearances with her sister Dorothea, her brother Adolf Philipp Christian and her parents. There were engagements in Hamburg (1776/77 and 1780-1783), in Braunschweig and L√ºneburg (1777-1779) and in M√ºnster. Between 1784 and 1786, now without their parents, she and her sister Dorothea had singing engagements at the Hamburg State Theatre (as it was then known). Here, according to one commentator, those who heard her could not praise highly enough the \\"melodious and wonderful timbre of this beautiful singer\\" (\\"melodischen herrlichen Gesang dieser sch√∂nen S√§ngerin\\"). In 1786 the sisters joined the theatre company of Gustav Friedrich Wilhelm Gro√ümann and Christian Wilhelm Klos. Under the music director August Burgm√ºller the company gave its performances in the larger Rhineland cities, notably Cologne, D√ºsseldorf, Bonn and Aachen. The company broke up in 1787, and during the 1789/90 season she played at the Bonn Court Theatre which had re-opened (after a five-year closure for mourning, following the death of the late Archbishop-Elector) in January 1789, and where the young Ludwig van Beethoven played the viola in the theatre orchestra. By May 1790 she had left Bonn and joined the National Theatre in Mannheim where she made her debut as Constanze, the lead role in Mozart's opera, Seraglio. She remained at Mannheim till April 1792, when she moved to Amsterdam to undertake some engagements at the \\"German Theatre\\" (\\"Deutsches Theater\\") there. Leaving Mannheim at short notice involved breaking her agreement, and she was obliged to pay a contractual penalty of 100 ducats when she returned to Mannheim in August 1792. In 1793 she went back to Amsterdam, this time accompanied by the tenor Karl Ha√üloch whom she married. Between 1795 and 1804 she worked with her husband in Kassel. There is an indication in one source of his having been in charge of the theatre company. There was then an extensive tour of Germany after which, in 1809, she withdrew completely from theatre work for a year. She then moved to the newly created Darmstadt Theatre, where she worked as a singer-actress and where she was appointed Court Actress (\\"Hofschauspielerin \\"). She withdrew to private life, this time permanently, in 1818.

It belongs to the Diocese of Lund. It contains many medieval mural paintings. History Construction of the church began in the 12th century with the nave and choir, and it has been successively enlarged during the Middle Ages and beyond. The nave was expanded towards the west during the 13th century, and the tower was constructed during the 14th century. During the 15th century, the two church porches with their crow-stepped gables were added to the church and the interior remade; the presently visible decorated brick vaults date from this time. The choir was enlarged during the 17th century, and contains the burial chamber of several different families who have owned nearby Gyllebo Manor since that time. It was enlarged in 1787. A major renovation was carried out in 1962. Murals The church contains many medieval murals dating from the late 15th century. They are considered to be of high quality and probably made by the same workshop or artist that made similar murals in Fj√§lkinge Church and Vallby Church. They were discovered some time before 1907, when the church was visited by the architect tied to Lund Cathedral, . W√•hlin discovered that the paintings, which had been covered over with whitewash, had been laid bare and that some attempts at restoring them had been made by a local painter. The murals mainly, but not exclusively, depict religious subjects. The paintings on western-most bay of the nave displays the story of the Last Judgment, while the rest of the nave shows depictions of saints; among these the three Nordic royal saints Olaf, Canute and Eric. On and close to the wall separating the choir from the nave are a number of depictions of prophets as well as Christ and Mary, while the side facing the choir depicts the fall of man. Furnishings The Romanesque baptismal font belonging to the church is from the 12th century, and is the only surviving medieval item in the church. The altarpiece is from the 1760s but displays an oil painting from the 19th century, and the pulpit dates from 1762. The church also contains a special pew made for the local lord in 1641 and decorated with sculptures depicting Moses, John the Baptist and coat of arms. The other pews is later, probably made in 1907. The church also is in possession of a cavalry flag from the 17th century, displaying the monogram of the Danish king Christian IV; it was given to the church by the lords of Gyllebo Manor.

Early life and family Caroline Agnes Gray was born Caroline Agnes Chisholm on 13 May 1848 in London. She was the sixth child of the eight children of the philanthropist Caroline Chisholm (n√©e Jones) and Archibald Chisholm (1798‚Äì1877), an officer in the army of the East India Company. Gray met her husband Edmund Dwyer Gray in September 1868 when she witnessed him saving five people from a wrecked schooner during a storm in Killiney Bay, near D√∫n Laoghaire. She later met him, and the couple were married in 1869. They had four children, with three surviving to adulthood: Edmund, Mary (1871‚Äì1913), and Sylvia (1873‚Äì1951). Gray placed both of her daughters in convents after their education and the early death of their father, supposedly as she feared they would harm her chances of remarrying. Political life Gray was a noted hostess during her husband's political career, in particular while he was Lord Mayor of Dublin. Following his death in 1888, she held over 40% of the shares in her husband's newspaper, the Freeman's Journal. While she was not involved in the day-to-day running of the company, she did exert influence over the newspaper. When Charles Stewart Parnell's party split, the paper sided with Parnell at Gray's consent. She was one of a number of prominent Catholic women in Dublin who continued to support Parnell. In 1891, she appeared with Parnell in public, leading to the Archbishop of Dublin describing her as \\"a rock of scandal.\\" It was only when the Freeman's Journal's circulation and revenue suffered after the establishment of an anti-Parnell newspaper, the National Press, that Gray's loyalty to Parnell wavered. Influenced by her son, Gray decided that the Freeman would abandon its relationship with Parnell. This decision was formalised at a special general meeting to the Freeman company on 21 September 1891, seeing the pro-Parnell board replaced with one that included Gray's son and Captain Maurice O'Conor. The Freeman and the National Press merged in March 1892, after which Gray was bought out of the company with her son and O'Conor stepping down from the board, thus ending the Gray family's 50 year relationship with the Freeman. Later life Gray married Captain O'Conor in November 1891. A Captain, and later a Major, with the Connaught Rangers, he was a relative of Charles Owen O'Conor and George Moore. Gray was 12 years his senior, and the couple had no children. They lived on Inisfale Island on Lough Allen, County Leitrim. Gray lived the last 30 years of her life there, with failing eyesight and eventual blindness. She died there 15 April 1927. O'Conor died in a hotel in D√∫n Laoghaire on 3 January 1941, in poor circumstances.

Early life Dr. James Inglis was born in Glasgow on 6 September 1813, the son of James Inglis, a merchant and his wife, Charlotte Spalding, the daughter of Charles Spalding, improver of the diving bell. Through his mother, Dr. Inglis was a member of the Smalls of Dirnanean, a Perthshire family that included direct ancestor, James Small, factor of the forfeited Robertson estates after Culloden. After early schooling in Musselburgh, Dr. Inglis became a student at the University of Edinburgh. While a student in Edinburgh, he received the Hope prize for chemistry for his paper, Essay on iodine and bromine. His mentor during this time was Sir George Ballingall. Receiving his medical degree in 1834, he became a member of the Royal College of Physicians of England in that same year. Medical career After graduation, Dr. Inglis set up practice at Castle Douglas. In 1835, he performed a brilliant home operation on gunshot victim, Maria Kennedy, removing the bullet from behind her left frontal bone. She had been shot by Kirkcudbright Stewart-officer Robert Blair. The patient survived and Dr. Inglis provided detailed testimony of the operation and the condition of the patient at the trial. In 1837 he moved to the Ripon Public Dispensary. Then in 1838, while at Ripon, Dr. Inglis published his Treatise of English Bronchocele. The work documented the epidemiology of goitre, using iodine treatment research Dr. Inglis had accumulated in both Scotland and England. In 1838, Dr. Inglis moved his practice to Halifax, West Yorkshire. Other pursuits Pursuing a lifelong passion for chemistry and geology, Inglis became the curator for the Halifax Literary & Philosophical Society. In 1843, while studying the Halifax coal beds, he discovered a new species of sea lily that he named Nautilus Rawsoni, which he named after Christopher Rawson, the founder of the Halifax Literary & Philosophical Society. Interested in phrenology, Dr. Inglis researched the brain of Eugene Aram, an infamous English murderer. Dr. Inglis was a Freemason and a past Master of the Yorkshire Lodge in Halifax. Personal life Dr. Inglis married Louisa Rawson (ca. 1826-1909), the daughter of Jeremiah Rawson, Esq., on 3 May 1842 at St. John the Baptist Church in Halifax. The couple had the following children: * Charlotte Hannah Louise Inglis (1843-1875), married Priestly Haigh Norris * Major James Argyll Spalding Inglis (1848-1883), British District Commissioner of Nicosia, 1882-1883 * Charles John Inglis (b. 1850), a solicitor A great- granddaughter of Dr. Inglis was Surrealist performance artist Sheila Legge. A brother-in-law of Dr. Inglis, and a fellow physician, was Dr. Charles Ransford. Dr. James Inglis died at Halifax on 9 March 1851. His sister, St. Clair Ransford, attributed his early death to cardiac arrest, likely due to several bouts of rheumatic fever as a young man. Dr. Inglis and his wife were buried in Holy Trinity Churchyard in Halifax, which unfortunately has been converted into a car park.

Two of his sons, Alb√©ric and Henry I Cl√©ment, were appointed the first and third Marshals of France respectively. Life and career Born to Robert II Cl√©ment and Mahaut de Tourneau sometime between 1120 and 1130, Robert inherited the seigneurie of Mez on his brother Aubry's death in 1148. He had accompanied Aubry to the Holy Land in 1147 as part of the Second Crusade, but returned to France after his brother's death at Constantinople in 1148. Robert then set about recovering property of the Lordship of Mez that Aubry had sold to the Ferri√®res Abbey in order to fund their journey, contesting the sale on the grounds that he, as the heir to the title, had never ratified it. Robert then entered the court of Louis VII of France along with his brother Giles, distinguishing himself in administration, gaining a reputation for good judgement and integrity, and becoming one of Louis's most prominent counselors towards the end of his reign. In 1178, he (alongside Giles) was one of the judges in the suit between Barthelemy of Paris and the Abbey of Saint-Germain- des-Pr√©s. Robert was appointed tutor to a young Philip II, with Robert of Auxerre noting in his work that he was also appointed guardian of the prince by his father Louis VII, although the exact nature of Robert's later relationship with the young monarch is not clear, with some sources putting Robert as simply one of the chiefs among Philip's ministers (alongside Giles) rather than a straightforward guardian or regent. In addition, Philip's actions even in the period immediately following his coronation show no signs of being dictated by a regent; the boy king even negotiated directly with Henry II on the matter of the French war against Philip I, Count of Flanders. Robert nevertheless exercised significant control and influence over Philip's early reign, with the king depending on Robert for day-to-day administration of the kingdom. Robert died sometime between 1181 and 1182 Giles appears to have briefly taken over his brother's position after his death. Family Robert had three sons with Hersende de Mez: Alb√©ric, Henry and Hugh. While both Alb√©ric and Henry would go on to serve at court and in the armies of the French sovereign, Hugh entered the Church, serving as abb√© of St Spire de Corbeil (1190-1196), and later Dean of Notre-Dame de Paris (1200-1203).

It was founded in 1851, and its current building on the Flint Cultural Center campus was built in 1958. It has hosted the Michigan Storytellers Festival since 1981 and the Julia A. Moore Poetry Contest (to celebrate bad poetry) since 1994. During the Flint water crisis, the library played a key role supporting the community, and in the aftermath it partnered with StoryCorps to create oral history interviews of residents' experiences. The Flint Public Library's collections document the City of Flint and Genesee County, local African- American history and literature, and genealogy. It also offers a Michigan Collection and an Automotive History Collection. The library has furthermore been designated a Federal Depository Library for government publications, maintains microfilm copies of The Flint Journal, and provides collections for both children and teenagers.  History  The Flint Public Library was founded in 1851 by a group of women who were active in the local community. Initially a Flint Board of Education department, it evolved into a district library serving residents of Flint and its surrounding communities. In 1905, the library created a children's collection. In 1965, it participated in a trial (along with the Grand Rapids Public Library) of an electronic article surveillance system that was developed by the American Library Association, which reduced the losses due to thefts in the library from $15,000 to approximately $1,500. In 1981, the Flint Public Library began holding the Michigan Storytellers Festival, which has been hosted both on site and at Crossroads Village in Genesee County. It has been attended by nationally prominent storytellers, including the Georgia Sea Island Singers, Bil Lepp, and Johnny Moses. In 1994, the library created the Julia A. Moore Poetry Contest to celebrate bad poetry, inspired by Julia A. Moore; she was known as \\"The Sweet Singer of Michigan\\" and considered \\"history's worst best-selling poet\\" by some poetry critics, according to William F. Ast III of The Herald- Palladium. In 2015, the Flint Public Library partnered with the A Kut Above barbershop to create the Read-While-You-Wait Library, a collection of books for boys ages 4‚Äì10 to read while waiting for haircuts. In the aftermath of the Flint water crisis, the library partnered with StoryCorps to create oral history interviews of residents' experiences, starting in 2016; this built off a previous, pre-water crisis partnership and resulted in interview recordings being deposited at the Library of Congress. Additionally, Julie Hordyk argued that the library played a key role supporting the community in three ways during the water crisis: firstly, its staff engaged directly in determining what course of action to take and how to handle resources; secondly, it served as a trusted and accessible gateway to critical information for community members; and thirdly, it linked donors from outside the city with the community's local response system. In February 2020, the library closed to allow for major renovations, and in July 2020 it opened a temporary location at Courtland Center in Burton.  Collections  The Flint Public Library preserves and provides access to collections documenting the City of Flint and Genesee County, including local African-American history and literature. Its Michigan Collection is one of the largest of its kind in the state, and it also has an Automotive History Collection. The library boasts Michigan's second-largest open-stack genealogical collection, which benefits from donations of family history-related materials from the Flint Genealogical Society, an organization that also maintains volunteers at the library to provide free assistance to those conducting genealogical research. Furthermore, the library has been designated a Federal Depository Library for government publications. In addition to a Children's Section that includes 50,000 volumes of both fiction and nonfiction, the Flint Public Library offers a Young Adult section known as \\"The Teen Zone\\" that provides information resources as well as literature for teenagers. Additionally, the library maintains microfilm copies of The Flint Journal. It is also home to a branch of the Michigan Legal Help Self-Help Center Network of Genesee County, which provides on-site \\"navigators\\" to answer questions from the public (although they do not give legal advice) in addition to resources available online through the library's computers.  Building  The Flint Public Library's Main Library is located on the western end of the Flint Cultural Center campus. The building was designed by Sulho Alexander Nurmi, Louis C. Kingscott & Associates and built in 1958. The library board partnered with OPN Architects to create a proposed $24-million renovation to the building, with the primary goals of maximizing the amount of the building's of space that is used publicly, keeping parts of the library open after regular hours, expanding the children's and teen areas, and creating a quiet zone. During the summer months, the library hosts arts, blues, and storytelling festivals outdoors on its lawns.

The lighthouse is notable as being one of the few locations in Australia where both the sunrise and the sunset can be observed. History The first recorded sighting of this part of Australia was by the Dutch sailor Haevik Claezoon van Hillegom in 1618. His countryman Willem de Vlamingh then charted the headland in 1696. In 1801 Nicolas Baudin named the area Cape Murat. The north west coast of Australia had been regarded as dangerous for many years. This coastline is one of the most hazardous stretches of coast in the world and the building of a lighthouse on this coast had long been considered. In 1907 a board of enquiry was set up and the captains of numerous coastal vessels were questioned to obtain their views on the best sites to build lighthouses on. Out of these, four locations were selected where lighthouses would be built in the subsequent two years. However, the wreck of the off the North West Cape in 1907 led to Vlamingh Head, a site which had been proposed by a number of ships' masters to the Board of Enquiry but had not gained sufficient support. Being recommended as the fifth lighthouse along this stretch of coast, in 1909 the Harbour and Lights Department announced that a lighthouse was to be constructed at Vlamingh Head. Construction of the lighthouse started in November 1911, but it was to be delayed by bad drinking water, outbreaks of dysentery among the labourers and the requirement to transport all of the building materials and supplies by sea from Fremantle. The lighthouse started operations on 10 November 1912 with a light that could be seen for up to . The light took two lighthouse keepers to keep its light burning. The light used kerosene and flashed twice every 7.5 seconds. Keepers' quarters were provided nearby and the supplies of fuel and the keepers' provisions landed on the beach and transported to the lighthouse by horse- drawn carriages on a tramway. The lighthouse operated for sixty years up to 1969 when the light was replaced by a light mounted on tower 11 at the US Naval Communications VLF site at Point Murat (Naval Communication Station Harold E. Holt). In the Second World War the North West Cape was an important refuelling depot for US Navy ships and an airbase was developed at Learmonth which led to a radar station being built near the lighthouse. In 1953 a cyclone caused considerable damage to both the airbase and the radar station and caused extensive damage to the lighthouse and keepers' quarters, with the keepers themselves doing much of the repair work themselves. Tourism The lighthouse has become a tourist attraction and the end of a scenic drive from Exmouth. The Ningaloo Lighthouse Holiday Park is situated close to the Vlamingh Head Lighthouse. Tourists are attracted by the landscape, the sunset and whale watching with information panels are provided to assist in interpretation of the site.

The drawing is generally considered as not successful;Berger (1996), 90 and is viewed as curious attempted depiction that is neither aesthetically pleasing nor anatomically true to life.

He shared the song through SoundCloud on April 28, 2014. Written by Bieber and Sam Hook, it was produced by Eric Hudson. It is a sentimental ballad song consisting of a twangy guitar solo, while Bieber uses a smooth vocal, sometimes reaching falsetto. Lyrically, \\"We Were Born For This\\" describes the problems of growing up in the public eye as a celebrity and ignoring the haters that usually come with such attention of fame.  Background and release  Recorded during early 2014, the song came during a time where Bieber had been facing many misdemeanors, including his first arrest in Miami, Florida, earlier in January of that year. It followed a few months after the release of Bieber's compilation album Journals in December 2013, which came with mediocre reception. Shortly after Bieber had released the song, he posted a video link on his Twitter account to the \\"I Was Born For This, My City\\" conference (hosted by Carl Lentz, a pastor that Bieber had known for a while) that took place earlier that year, which the song is probably based on as well. Bieber shared the track on his SoundCloud account on April 28, 2014, which he had linked to by announcing the release on his Twitter account.  Composition  \\"We Were Born For This\\" was written by Justin Bieber and Sam Hook. It was produced by Eric Hudson. The song is a slow sentimental ballad format, with most of it using a twangy guitar solo, while Bieber uses breathy and gentle vocals that occasionally reach falsetto. Lyrically, the song describes having to grow up in the face of the public as a celebrity and dealing with both the positive and the negative attention that can come with it, with Bieber crooning \\"And I won't waste it thinking about what you gotta say / Cause I'm here to stay\\" and \\"Look at all the people / Standing outside / So dedicated\\".  Controversy  The cover art for \\"We Were Born For This\\" received criticism due to the similarity between it and the cover art for American rock band Paramore's 2007 album Riot!, which used a very similar design and font ‚Äì it later transpired that the artwork had been made in 2011 on a Tumblr post. Hayley Williams, the lead vocalist and songwriter of Paramore, did not comment on the controversy, though she referred to it on Twitter.

He is the author of the 2018 essay collection I Can't Date Jesus, a New York Times bestselling book. His second book is entitled I Don't Want to Die Poor (2020).  Early life  Michael Joseph Arceneaux was born April 12, 1984, in Houston, Texas, to a working-class Black family from Louisiana. His mother, a registered nurse, was a devout Catholic and Arceneaux was raised in the church, even briefly considering the priesthood. Arceneaux, from the Hiram Clarke community, attended Madison High School in Houston, then, on a combination of scholarships and student loans, enrolled at Howard University, where he majored in broadcast journalism and wrote for campus newspaper The Hilltop. He graduated in 2007, becoming the first man in his family to graduate from college.  Career  After college, Arceneaux moved to Los Angeles where he began his writing career. He has written for The Guardian, New York magazine, Essence, Rolling Stone, Teen Vogue, BuzzFeed, Vulture,The Washington Post, The New York Times and XOJane, as well as writing an advice column, called \\"Dearly Beloved\\", at Into. = Books =  I Can't Date Jesus  Arceneaux's first book, a collection of 17 humorous personal essays entitled I Can't Date Jesus: Love, Sex, Family, Race, and Other Reasons I‚Äôve Put My Faith in Beyonc√©, was published on July 24, 2018 from Atria Books. The book debuted at number 14 on The New York Times best-seller list for paperback nonfiction. It focuses on his early life as a young Black gay man growing up in a religious household in the southern United States. The book's title arises in response to Arceneaux's Catholic upbringing and its implications for him as a gay man, particularly the idea that even if being gay was not a choice, he should not act on it; finding that theological debates on the subject did not tend to prove fruitful, Arceneaux decided, \\"Easier to just clarify, 'I plan to have sex, so I can‚Äôt date Jesus.'\\" Arceneaux completed the manuscript in 2011, but the search for an agent delayed the book's publication. Ultimately he signed with Jim McCarthy, who had originally declined his query but Arceneaux persisted, sending him more essays to read and McCarthy changed his mind. Reviewers have compared Arceneaux's essay collection to the work of Roxane Gay, David Sedaris, and Samantha Irby. In Vogue, Chloe Schama and Bridget Read noted Arceneaux's \\"hysterically funny, vulnerable\\" style, calling the collection \\"a triumph of self-exploration, tinged with but not overburdened by his reckoning with our current political moment...The result is a piece of personal and cultural storytelling that is as fun as it is illuminating.\\"  I Don't Want to Die Poor  Arceneaux's second book, I Don't Want to Die Poor (2020), expands on his essay for The New York Times describing his private student loan debt.

Published by Atria, the collection includes seventeen essays, discussing Arceneaux's conflicting identities, his internalized homophobia, his journey as a writer, and his experiences dating. It also discusses his passion for the singer Beyonc√©, who shares his hometown of Houston, Texas. Arceneaux was previously a Roman Catholic, and is a gay African-American. This is his first book. It was released on July 24, 2018. Development According to Arceneaux, \\"I wanted to write about my life with a mix of pathos and humor‚Äîthe same way a lot of white male authors like David Sedaris and Augusten Burroughs get to write about their lives.\\" In 2011 the writing process was complete, but Arceneaux did not publish it until 2018 because he needed an agent and publisher. Dystel, Goderich, & Bourret agent Jim McCarthy initially declined to represent Arceneaux but changed his mind after reading some of Arceneaux's essays. Rakesh Satyal of Altria became his editor; according to Arceneaux his supervision strengthened his book. Arceneaux had a conversation with his mother, who believed God opposes homosexuality, and his title is a reference to that conversation. She stated that since she knew he had sex with another man, she was not confident that he was going to go to heaven. He stated that the best response to a religious person who interprets his or her religion as being opposed to homosexuality is \\"I plan to have sex, so I can‚Äôt date Jesus.\\" He first finished the book and then selected its title. Contents Michelle Raji of the Texas Observer stated that the book's construction as a \\"series of explanations\\" is similar to those of self-help books, making it \\"a logical extension of the polemic, confessional style he‚Äôs perfected online\\" as well as being \\"accessible to a larger audience\\". One essay discusses how he does not have an admiration for whiteness because his parents deliberately took him to African-American healthcare personnel, he attended primary and secondary schools that had mostly African-American and Hispanic and Latino students, and he attended a historically black university. In \\"The Place Is No Sanctuary\\" he discusses homophobia in black-owned barbershops, which are for non-gay blacks places to socialize. In \\"I See A Priest in You\\" he received a suggestion that he become a priest, but Arceneaux decides not to do this. \\"You Will Die Poor\\" discusses his life as a low income resident of Los Angeles. \\"The First, the Worst\\" and \\"Learning How to Ho and Date and Failing at Both\\" discuss his romantic life. In Chapter 15 the author states his dislike of President Donald Trump and his administration, as well as Arceneaux's coming out to his mother. Reception In Vogue, Chloe Schama and Bridget Read noted Arceneaux's \\"hysterically funny, vulnerable\\" style, calling the collection \\"a triumph of self-exploration, tinged with but not overburdened by his reckoning with our current political moment...The result is a piece of personal and cultural storytelling that is as fun as it is illuminating.\\" Savas Abadsidis of The Advocate stated that the book's humor is similar to that of David Sedaris. According to Tre'vell Anderson of the Los Angeles Times, observers also compared the writing to that of Samantha Irby. Raji stated that the book \\"is an admirable attempt to reverse\\" a dynamic of mostly white-owned media stakeholders asking for racial ethnic minorities to \\"lead with his otherness, to write [one's] identity not just as a perspective but as a spectacle\\", and that I Can't Date Jesus has \\"a little more story and a little less spectacle.\\" According to Raji, \\"the high-wire act between fun and serious does not land\\" in about half of the essays, including the romance-related ones, but that the \\"standout essay on sexual racism and interracial dating redeems these false starts.\\" She also described the priest essay as a \\"standout\\". Publishers Weekly stated that the book's \\"confident voice and unapologetic sense of humor will appeal to fans of Roxane Gay.\\" Kirkus Reviews described it as \\"A funny, fierce, and bold memoir in essays.\\" See also * History of the African Americans in Houston * LGBT culture in Houston * Christianity in Houston References External links * I Can't Date Jesus - Simon and Schuster Category:2018 non-fiction books Category:American essay collections Category:LGBT literature in the United States Category:English-language books Category:Simon & Schuster books Category:Books about men Category:African- American autobiographies Category:Gay non-fiction books Category:2010s LGBT literature Category:Books critical of Christianity ","title":"I Can't Date Jesus"},{"id":"57967929","text":"Papaver degenii, the Pirin poppy (), is a poppy endemic to the Pirin Mountains of south-western Bulgaria where it is found at altitudes from 2,100 to 2,900 m.
