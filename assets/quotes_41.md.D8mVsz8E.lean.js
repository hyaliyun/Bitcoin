He first appears as one of the Fair Folk in the second novel of the series, The Black Cauldron. He also makes an appearance in the fifth and final novel, The High King.  Description  Gwystyl is one of the Fair Folk, (possibly a Sidhe), a race of magical creatures who live in the fictional land of Prydain. He is described as resembling \\"a bundle of sticks with cobwebs floating at the top.\\"Alexander, Lloyd, The Black Cauldron, Holt, 1965. p 53 He appears sickly, with sparse, long and stringy hair. He wears a mournful expression and with his anxious eyes, seems constantly on the verge of tears. His personality is no cheerier; he constantly complains and snivels, is a pessimist, and appears cowardly. He avoids conflict by asserting, \\"I am not up to it today...I'm not well, not at all well, really.\\" Gwystyl lives in a hidden underground waypost near the border of Annuvin, the dominion of the villain of the series. He has a pet crow, named Kaw. In the novels =The Black Cauldron= Taran and his companions meet Gwystyl as they are escaping the Huntsmen of Annuvin after their failed attempt to obtain the Black Crochan. Under the pressure of fellow Fair Folk, Doli, he gives them refuge from the vicious Huntsmen in his underground lair, but he immediately encourages them to leave. To the annoyance of Gwystyl, Kaw (who can speak one word sentences) blurts out the names of Orddu, Orwen and Orgoch in connection with the Cauldron. Gwystyl reluctantly reveals that the three sorceresses possess the Cauldron in the Marshes of Morva. After the companions have rested, Gwystyl sends them with directions to the Marshes with a supply of magical aides. Gwystyl reappears near the end of the novel and assists the companions in the final battle scenes. It is revealed that Gwystyl is actually shrewd and brave, portraying a weaker image to his advantage. \\"Did you believer King Eiddileg would trust a lesser servant so close to Annuvin? But if you misjudged him, it was his intention that you do so.\\"Alexander, Lloyd, The Black Cauldron, Holt, 1965. p. 158 As the Cauldron is destroyed, Gwystyl gives Kaw to Taran as thanks from the Fair Folk. Kaw becomes a trusted companion throughout the remainder of the novels. =The High King= Gwystyl reappears in the fifth and final novel of the series, The High King. When Taran has been kidnapped, his companions Eilonwy, Fflewddur Fflam, and Prince Rhun enlist Gwystyl's aide in organizing an attack on Caer Cadarn, using additional supplies from Gwystyl's bag of magical tricks. They defeat Magg only because of Gwystyl's help. Much later, Gwystyl leads an army of Fair Folk reinforcements in the final days of climactic battle for the control of Prydain. It is again revealed that his melancholy personality masks a brave and true individual. In his first appearance in the novel, he was reporting from a dangerous spying mission; in the second, he was one of the few who could lead the Fair Folk to fight with the humans. In a final note, Gwystyl returns to Eiddileg's underground kingdom with the passing of magic from Prydain, never to return above ground. It is also explained that Gwystyl's personality and health were affected by living so close to the region of Annuvin, further burnishing his valiance.Tunnell, Michael O., The Prydain Companion, Holt, 1989. p 133 Origins According to a 1999 publisher's note, first quoting Alexander on The Chronicles, \\"'The people in it were born, like most children, at unlikely and inconvenient times.' ... The author first met the hopelessly distraught and harassed Gwystyl while sitting, under protest, in a dentist's chair!\\" The Black Cauldron (Henry Holt, 1999), \\"About the Author\\", [page 181]. This is from the first paragraph of \\"About the Author\\", which differs from volume to volume in the 1999 reissue, and precedes five 1973 paragraphs essentially unrevised. (The Foundling and Other Tales of Prydain, 1973). Alexander seemed to enjoy creating the self-pitying Gwystyl. When a friend complimented him on his \\"interesting self-portrait\\", he only very reluctantly agreed that he was qualified to play hypochondriac! According to Alexander, nearly all of the proper names in Prydain are from Welsh myth or history, perhaps all except Eilonwy and Taran.Lloyd Alexander Interview Transcript (1999). Interview with Scholastic students. Scholastic Inc. Retrieved 2009-04-17. Like many others, the name Gwystyl is from the collection of medieval Welsh-language prose tales known as the Mabinogion. However, none of the characters in those tales resemble Alexander's character.

Etymology The first element ban (Thai: ‡∏ö‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô) means home or village.Thai/English Dictionary The second element dong (Thai: ‡∏î‡∏á) means forest or jungle. The third element phayom (Thai: ‡∏û‡∏¢‡∏≠‡∏°) is a type of rainforest tree of the genus Shorea indigenous to Thailand.Shorea roxburghii While there is no common name for phayom in the English language, Philippine mahogany is a mixture of Shorea genera. A loose translation of the name as a whole would be \\"phayom wood forest village\\". There are few phayom trees left in Ban Dongphayom, as villagers have cleared the majority of the land for agriculture over the years. The phayom tree is an endangered species. Geography Ban Dongphayom lies in the western portion of Nakhon Pa Mak, bordering Ban Sam Ruen.Ban Dongphayom at ZoomHit.com It is on land between the Wang Thong and the Wat Ta Yom Rivers, within the Nan Basin (part of the Chao Phraya Watershed). A canal flows through the village, which leads to Ban Grong Greng, where it joins another canal that joins the Wang Thong River at Ban Sam Ruen.Google Earth Government The current village headman of Ban Dongphayom is Phu Yai Ban Lamiet Muenpet. This position is an elected post, which is then followed by appointment by the Ministry of the Interior. Economy Rice farming, Ban Dongphayom Ban Dongphayom is a rural agricultural residential village. Resident farmers in Ban Dongphayom are primarily engaged in the business of growing rice. However, most farms are diversified, growing sugar cane, bananas, mangos, papayas, chili peppers, coconuts, spices and herbs. Farmers in Ban Dongphayom also typically raise livestock such as cattle, chicken and pigs. A public pharmacy is also run from one of the homes in Ban Dongphayom which supplies medication to Ban Dongphayom villagers and residents of surrounding villages in Nakhon Pa Mak. Villagers also engage in fishing in the canal which flows through the village. As of 2001, running water had just been installed in Ban Dongphayom, and the water quality was not yet suitable for drinking. Electricity is available and most homes have televisions. Phone lines, however are not installed. Some villagers use mobile phones for communication outside the village. Transportation in and out of the village is over narrow dirt roads. These roads are the primary route for transportation in Ban Dongphayom, although the canal is navigable for small boats. Small bridges such as the bridge at Ban Dongphayom prevent larger vessels from navigating the canal. Wildlife Ban Dongphayom is a natural habitat to a wide variety of insects, reptiles, amphibians, fish and other wildlife. Venomous snakes are a threat to the residents, and villagers take precautions in their daily activities to avoid being bitten. Mosquitos are also a problem due to the amount of standing water in the nearby rice farms, although there are no recent cases of Malaria reported. Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendens) are found in the canal flowing through the village, and children of the village often collect them for pets. Crabs live in the standing water of the rice farms. Culture Dancers at a wedding reception, Ban Dongphayom Residents of Ban Dongphayom are Theravada Buddhists. Ancestor worship is practiced, and homes often have shrines dedicated to elders of the family who have died. Offerings of food and drink are placed beside the shrines. Children of Ban Dongphayom attend school in neighboring Ban Sam Ruen. They travel to school by bicycle and on foot. There is no bus service. Large celebrations are commonplace in Ban Dongphayom, as local weddings and other events such as coming-of-age ceremonies and death anniversaries are well attended by the entire community. Celebrations involve days of preparation and entertainment is customary. Singers and dancers are typically hired for these events. Traditional ethnic clothing is no longer worn by villagers of Ban Dongphayom, other than for certain religious ceremonies. Men of the village, however, often obtain astrological tattoos on their bodies, which they believe protect them from danger.Thai Temple Tattoos at InkedBlog(discussion of Thai astrological tattoos) Monks use different tools to make the tattoos. Some of the monks use sharpened sticks of bamboo; others use thin weighted metal rods. Wat Dongphayom Wat Dongphayom (Thai: ‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏î‡∏î‡∏á‡∏û‡∏¢‡∏≠‡∏°) is a small temple in Ban Dongphayom.Wat Dongphayom at WebWat.net(Thai) Wat Dongphayom was built in the 1980s on the grounds of a defunct cemetery.

Early life and career He was the son of Carlos Manuel de C√©spedes and Ana Maria de Quesada y Loinaz. He was also a distant cousin of Perucho Figueredo. In 1915, he married Laura Bertini y Alessandri, an Italian, first in Rome and then later again at City Hall in New York City by Mayor John Purroy Mitchel. They had one child together, the daughter Alba de C√©spedes y Bertini. He was educated first in New York City until 1885, when his mother took him and his twin sister to Germany. He later earned degrees in international law and diplomacy from the Instituto Stanislas in Paris, France. In 1895, he returned to Cuba and from 1895 to 1898 he fought in the War of Independence, becoming a teniente coronel (lieutenant colonel) and the revolutionary post of governor of the Province of Santiago de Cuba. Former Cuban embassy and residence of Carlos Manuel de C√©spedes y Quesada in Washington, D.C. Initial role in Cuban politics He later entered Cuban politics and from 1902 to 1908, was vice president of the Cuban House of Representatives. Then in 1909, he joined the Cuban diplomatic service and represented his country as minister to Italy, and to Argentina, and as a special envoy to Greece. In 1914, he was Cuban Ambassador to the United States. He returned to Cuba in 1922, to become Foreign Minister under Gerardo Machado but resigned after a year. President Machado then named him Ambassador to Mexico but C√©spedes delayed his departure for reasons of ill health. Presidency Thereafter, he was active in trying to overthrow Machado. In August 1933, Machado left Cuba and C√©spedes was offered the position of President. He took office on August 12, 1933, his 62nd birthday. C√©spedes's Cabinet included Gobernaci√≥n, Colonel Federico Laredo Bru, Union Nacionalista Justicia, Dr. Carlos Saladrigas Zayas, A.B.C. Hacienda, Dr. Joaquin Martinez Saenz, A.B.C.

The reasons for the tensions within the army included that various officials of Machado's administration were allowed to leave the country, that high- ranking army officials who were part of Machado‚Äôs administration still held their army positions, and that General Sanguily, the Army Chief of Staff, was still hospitalized. Welles noted the following on August 24, 1933: \\"I am rapidly coming to the conclusion that my original hope that the present Government of Cuba (C√©spedes' administration) could govern as a constitutional government for the remainder of the term for which General Machado had himself elected must be abandoned. If the solid and unwavering support of the Army could be counted on, and if the groups and parties represented in the present Government were unanimous in their support of the administration, it might be possible for the existing Government to maintain itself, pass the necessary legislation of all kinds required, and hold the general national elections in November 1934 as originally anticipated. As a matter of fact, however, a general process of disintegration is going on. The Army is by no means in a satisfactory condition and the relapse in the health of General Sanguily, Chief of Staff and the one ranking officer in the Cuban Army who can command the support of his subordinates, has delayed the taking of the measures necessary to enforce discipline within the Army which he alone could have undertaken satisfactorily.Foreign Relations of the United States: Diplomatic Papers, 1933. The American Republics: Volume V,p. 371 http://images.library.wisc.edu/FRUS/EFacs/1933v05/reference/frus.frus1933v05.i0010.pdf Given those circumstances, Welles proposed that \\"general elections may be held approximately 3 months from now so that Cuba may once more have a constitutional government in the real sense of the word.\\" C√©spedes agreed, and on August 25, 1933, issued Presidential Decree 1298, which basically annulled the 1928 constitutional reforms and re-established the 1901 Constitution of Cuba in its entirety, terminated the presidential mandate of Machado, dissolved the Cuban Congress, vacated the seats of the Supreme Court of Cuba, and declared that a general election would be held on February 24, 1934, for a new presidential term to begin on May 20, 1934.Foreign Relations of the United States: Diplomatic Papers, 1933.

Upon returning and reaching the presidential palace, Ram√≥n Grau and members of the DEU or Directorio Estudiantil Universitario were awaiting him. \\"At 1 p.m. the Cespedes Cabinet resigned and President Cespedes left the Palace to go to his own house.

In 1935, he returned to Cuba and wrote several books including Carlos Manuel de C√©spedes, Las Banderas de Yara y de Bayamo, and Manuel de Quesada y Loyn√°z. He received numerous honors and awards including the Grand Cross of the Order of Carlos Manuel de C√©spedes of Cuba, the Grand Cross of Belgium, the Grand Cross of Italy, the Grand Cross of Peru, the Grand Cross of the Spanish Republic, the Grand Ribbon of the Order of the Liberator of Venezuela, the Order of Merit (Chile), Commander of the National Order of the Legion of Honour of France, and of the Order of St. Lazaro and St. Maurice of Italy.

Jenkins' interest in motorsports began with racing motorcycles on dirt tracks and cross country. He then became interested in land speed records at the Bonneville Salt Flats. He was instrumental in establishing Bonneville as a location for such events, and in attracting overseas drivers such as George Eyston and Sir Malcolm Campbell to compete there. He drove the Duesenberg \\"Mormon Meteor\\" to a 24-hour average land speed record of in 1935. In 1940 Jenkins set the 24-hour record of a average that lasted for 50 years (until 1990).Ab Jenkins: Son Of The Salt He died on a visit to Milwaukee, Wisconsin.Oregonian, August 11, 1956, Page 15. Safety record Often called \\"The World's Safest Speedster,\\" Jenkins was the father of salt racing. In 50 years of driving, he amassed nearly 3 million miles without an accident, which included 42 coast-to-coast trips across the continental US. Two of them were speed runs, however, after 1931, he confined his efforts strictly to the track. Early Days and Records Born in 1883, Jenkins, a Utah building contractor, got his start driving a Studebaker in 1925 when he raced a Union Pacific train from Salt Lake City to Wendover beating the smoke-belcher by five minutes. Next, in 1926, starting from New York City, he drove a Studebaker touring sedan to San Francisco in 86 hours, 20 minutes again besting the train by 14 hours. Records were set in Pierce-Arrows as well as a 68 mph salt flats run on an Allis-Chalmers farm tractor that he remarked was \\"like riding a frightened bison\\" before building a series of purpose-built salt flats cars. In 1925, Jenkins was hired by Pierce-Arrow to soup up their newly introduced V12 engine which produced a disappointing level of performance. He managed to coax 175 hp out of the engine, driving a Pierce- Arrow along the Utah salt flats at over 100 mph in a 24-hour journey along a 10-mile course. The total number of miles achieved during the run was 2,710. The following year, he set out to break that record by driving 25 hours and 30 minutes at around 117 mph and making a total of 3000 miles. As the 1930s began and speed records were being broken regularly, the Bonneville Salt Flats was found to be preferable to the sands of Daytona Beach or the Monthlh√©ry track in France. By 1935, the course was attracting international attention and in July of that year, Jenkins provided accommodations to British driver John Cobb and even relinquished his spot on the flats to him. Cobb succeeded in breaking Jenkins's records during the run. In late 1935, Jenkins drove a new supercharged Duesenberg Model J which allowed him to retake his title from John Cobb, but the land speed record in that race fell to another British competitor, Malcolm Campbell, who drove the aircraft-engine-powered Blue Bird V to a record two-way average speed of 301.130 mph. Realizing that he needed even more power to stay on top, Jenkins equipped his car with a Curtiss Conqueror aircraft engine. The Salt Lake City newspaper Deseret News ran a contest to give the vehicle a name, which ended up being dubbed the \\"Mormon Meteor\\". Due to extensive modifications needed to accommodate the Curtiss engine, it quickly became the Mormon Meteor II and Jenkins broke land speed endurance records with it during 1936-37. In 1938, he debuted the Mormon Meteor III, setting even more records. The most notable was in 1940 when Jenkins managed 3,868 miles in 24 hours at an average speed of 161 mph, a record that stayed unchallenged until 2005. During WWII, the US government ordered a halt to racing activities and Jenkins decided to run for mayor of Salt Lake City, winning handily despite spending no time or money campaigning. After the war, Jenkins resumed racing. On July 20, 1951, his car skidded on a puddle of water and struck a row of course markers at a speed of nearly 200 mph. The radiator was punctured by the accident and Jenkins had to halt his overheating vehicle. He had stopped three minutes short of breaking a new one- hour speed record and at the age of 68, he decided it was time to retire. Considering his limited resources, Jenkins enjoyed remarkable achievements, something on the order of Will Rogers with a motorized persona. He was a deeply religious man, who put his faith in God, and by God, he went far, especially driving his ‚ÄúMormon Meteor‚Äù speed machines. Harvey Firestone was an avid admirer. Jenkins became pals with New York Metropolitan Opera Singer Richard Bonelli when they were working as mechanics before Bonelli discovered he could sing. Bonelli attended many of Jenkins record runs and often instigated a song fest with spectators joining the famous baritone as Ab whizzed past. Jenkins racing fame coupled with his congenial, outgoing nature got him elected Mayor of Salt Lake in 1940 without ever giving a speech, or spending a nickel on a campaign. He served until 1944 setting 21 speed records while in office. His one-man 24-hour record averaging 161MPH, stood for 50 years, beaten in 1990 by an eight driver team. Jenkins's exhausting, 48-hour record is still on the books together with 15 other FIA records from 1940. After some full day runs, he would hop out clean-shaven, having used a safety razor after the last gas stop while circling the track at over 125 mph with no windshield. In 1956, Pontiac executives petitioned Jenkins to make a comeback. In one of his final interviews that June, he reported that his health was good and he felt up to it. Jenkins and his son Marvin to drive its stock-model Series 860 Pontiac around the famous 10-mile salt circle track. The pair recorded an average speed of 118.375 mph shattering all existing American unlimited and Class C stock-car racing records in the process. Ab drove almost two-thirds of the 2,841 miles himself gulping down milk and orange juice handed to him by his wife or daughter during his 30-second fueling pit stops. He did not smoke or drink alcohol. Father-and-son dominated the record book claiming a total of 28 records. Ab's Passing A 1957 Pontiac Bonneville, the rarest of all Pontiacs--in honour of Ab and Marv In August of that same year, Ab went to drive a Pontiac pace car at the Road America in Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin. Returning to his hotel from a baseball game with Pontiac executives George Bourke and Robert Emerick on August 9, Jenkins noticed a billboard with a farm tractor on it and started telling the men about his 1935 wild ride when he suddenly grabbed his chest and died of a heart attack. The next year, General Motors introduced the 1957 Pontiac ‚ÄúBonneville‚Äù in honor of Ab and Marv's achievements making it the first, and perhaps the only car to ever ‚Äúearn‚Äù its name and not simply be ‚Äúgiven‚Äù its name by an automaker. Of the 630 limited production run, each dealer got only one, making it the rarest of all Pontiacs ever produced. The new Bonneville was the fastest of the division ‚Äì zero to sixty in 8.1 seconds thanks to the new fuel injected V8 that cranked out 300HP plus. All convertibles, all automatics, the car delivered loaded with options for $5,782 ‚Äì approaching double that of the Star Chief Custom Convertible ($3,105) with which it shared the 124-inch-wheelbase chassis.

It lies northeast of Petersburg, Alaska and the Baird Glacier drains into the bay. Thomas Bay is also known as \\"The Bay of Death\\" due to a massive landslide in 1750. It also gained the name of \\"Devil's Country\\" several people claimed to have seen devil creatures in the area in 1900. The bay is named for U.S. Navy officer Charles M. Thomas. Natural history Thomas Bay is known for being rich in gold and quartz. The wildlife of the area includes moose, brown bears, black bears, squirrels, wolves, rabbits, and other common Alaskan creatures. The land in the area has been used for logging. Bay of Death In 1750, a native (Tlingit) village on Thomas Bay was completely buried by a large landslide. Over 500 Alaska Native people died in the natural disaster. From that day on the bay was dubbed \\"The Bay of Death\\" (or \\"Geey Nana\\" in the Tlingit language.). Devil's Country In 1900, the first documented account of the legendary devil creatures of the Thomas Bay area was written by Harry D. Colp. Colp and three of his prospecting friends identified only as Charlie, John, and Fred, were staying in Wrangell, Territory of Alaska. As the story goes, Charlie received word from an Alaska Native of the Thomas Bay area to mine for gold there. > He told me to go up to Thomas Bay* and camp on Patterson River on the right > side, travel upriver for about and then turn to the high mountains, and > after traveling about a mile and a half, I would find a lake shaped like a > half-moon. Charlie went to check out the native man's story of the gold that was to be found in the mountains in May 1900. When he returned in June 1900, he arrived without a coat or his hat, and his canoe was empty except for a large piece of quartz. =Moon Lake and the Devil Creatures= Charlie claimed to have arrived in Thomas Bay, but could not find the half-moon shaped lake. Instead he spent some time off an S-shaped lake (actually called Ess Lake). He claimed that the surrounding area seemed oddly devoid of life; there were no squirrels, no birds, etc. Wanting to get his bearings after he found the large chunk of quartz he later brought back in his canoe, he climbed to the top of a ridge. From there he could spot Frederick Sound, Cape of the Straight Light, the point of Vanderput Spit (Point Vanderput), and Sukhoi Island from the mouth of Wrangell Narrows. Behind the ridge, Charlie finally spotted the half- moon shaped lake, which is where the Patterson Glacier ends at a lake which drains into the Patterson River. It was from this point that Charlie claims that a swarm of \\"devil creatures\\" were making their way up the ridge from the half-moon shaped lake. Charlie claimed that he barely managed to outrun the strange creatures and that he received several scratches along his back from them. He never returned to the area. =Strangest Story Ever= The people who have had encounters with these creatures seem to go into hysterics and are usually deemed \\"temporarily insane.\\" The creatures have always been described as looking neither like man or monkey, but covered with coarse hair and oozing sores. They are foul smelling. They are about tall and have claw-like fingers. In 1925, a trapper reported losing a dog in the hills around Thomas Bay, but finding strange tracks, with the hind feet resembling a cross between a bear's and a human's footprints. The trapper returned later to find the traps he had hastily left; some were sprung, some were not. Some were destroyed. He set out to try to find his dog, and was never seen again. In 1974 Harry Colp's daughter Virginia was interviewed by writer Irving Warner in Petersburg, Alaska. She had helped her father in the production of the story, and was extremely familiar with it. She was sure of the basic veracity of her father's narrative with regard to how he saw and lived it. She said that she could not, and would not, say whether her father‚Ä≤s story was true, false, or some sort of mental aberration. She did, however, express confidence in her father's abilities and truthfulness. Naturally, she had fielded many questions about it afterwards. She did say that large amounts of arsenic were alleged to be present in the watershed at Thomas Bay, which might or might not help to explain the strange events reported by visitors.

In the course of his ministry, he was accused of heresy by Church officials, eventually becoming suspended but not formally excommunicated. Batista has been declared a saint by the Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church. He was listed in the Top 100 Greatest Brazilians of All Time in July 2012. Reconciliation with the Roman Catholic Church happened in December 2015. Biography Batista was born in the Municipality of Crato, Cear√°, in 1844, the son of Joaquim Rom√£o Batista and Joaquina Vic√™ncia Romana. When he was six years old, he started to study under Rufino de Alc√¢ntara Montezuma. In his youth, he took a vow of chastity, made when he was twelve years old. This was influenced by his reading the life of St. Francis de Sales. In 1860, Batista went to school in Cajazeiras, but because of the untimely death of his father in 1862, he had to return home to his mother and sisters. The death of his father, who was a small businessman in Crato, brought serious financial difficulties to his family. Batista was ordained a priest on November 30, 1870. After his ordination he returned to Crato and taught Latin in the Col√©gio Padre Ibiapina, founded and directed by Jos√© Joaquim Teles Marrocos, his cousin and friend. =Juazeiro= An iconic representation of Padre C√≠cero, on display in the city of Agrestina. For Christmas of 1871, invited by his teacher Sime√£o Correia de Macedo, Batista visited for the first time the small community of Juazeiro (which at the time was part of Crato) and celebrated the traditional Missa do galo (Mass at Dawn). Batista, who was 28 years old, impressed the locals. And he was impressed by them. So after a few months, on April 11, 1872, he was back in Juazeiro with his family and suitcases, to stay there as a permanent resident. Many books state that Batista decided to stay in Juazeiro because of a dream or vision that he had. This supposed dream occurred after a long day of hearing confessions, when he looked for a room to rest in and fell asleep. According to his close friends, he saw Jesus Christ and the twelve apostles sitting at a table, similar to Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper. Suddenly, the place was full of poor Northeastern Brazilians. Christ, looking to the poor, said that he was upset with humanity, but that he was still willing to do the last sacrifice to save the world. But, if men didn't repent quickly, He was going to destroy everything at once. At that moment, he pointed to the poor and, said, \\"And you, Padre C√≠cero, take care of them!\\" In 1889, when Maria de Araujo received Holy Communion from Batista, her mouth started to bleed. While the local people saw this as a miracle, Church authorities suspected other causes. The Holy Office in Rome charged him with heresy and mystification. His faculties to celebrate Mass and the sacraments were suspended in 1894, though he continued to celebrate Mass at his church. In 1898, he met with Pope Leo XIII in Rome, and he was granted a partial reprieve. =Apostleship= Batista initially started work on the small local chapel, getting different images with the offerings of the faithful. Afterwards, touched by the burning desire to win over the people that God confided into his care, he started intense preaching. He gave many counsels, and made many visits to homes, starting to exercise great leadership in the community. Also, he began to try to change the immoral customs of the people, personally getting rid of excessive drunkenness and prostitution. With harmony restored, the community started to grow. Many people from neighboring communities were attracted by the new large chapel. =Politician= Batista was actively involved in the politics of his time and was a member of the Conservative Republican Party of Brazil. When Juazeiro was raised to the status of a municipality, he was appointed its first mayor. He governed the city in this capacity for most of the next twenty years. Despite some attempts to relate Batista to communism and, much later, to Liberation Theology, he was deeply anti-communist. In an interview given in 1931, he stated: \\"Communism was started by the Devil. Lucifer is his name and the dissemination of his doctrine is the war of the Devil against God. I know communism and I know that it's evil. It's the continuation of the war of the fallen angels against the Creator and His children.\\" =Death= Batista died on July 20, 1934, in Juazeiro do Norte, Brazil, at the age of 90. He was buried in the Church of Our Lady of Perpetual Help. Legacy Statue of Padre C√≠cero, erected in the city of Juazeiro do Norte, the motto of which is \\"The Land of Padre C√≠cero\\" Today, a large statue of Padre C√≠cero stands in Juazeiro do Norte, where he is considered to be the patron saint of the city. A pilgrimage to this statue takes place in his honour every November, attracting hundreds of thousands of followers. Batista was canonized by the Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church, an Independent Catholic church. He is not recognized as a saint by the Catholic Church, though Pope Benedict XVI proposed a study on Padre C√≠cero as a candidate for canonization. On 13 December 2015, as part of the opening ceremonies of the Holy Year proclaimed by Pope Francis, the Bishop of Crato, Fernando Panico, M.S.C., declared the rehabilitation of Batista's status with the Roman Catholic Church. He further declared C√≠cero to have been a man of extraordinary virtues, formally reconciling him with the Church.

In North America, the first part of the manga has been licensed by Denpa and being released in a six-volume omnibus edition. The first volume was published in December 2019. Kaiji is a popular series in Japan and the manga had over 21.5 million tank≈çbon copies in circulation, as of January 2019. In 1998, the manga was the winner of the 22nd Kodansha Manga Award in the General category.  Plot Japan, February 1996. 3 years after graduating from high school and moving to Tokyo to get a job, Kaiji It≈ç fails to find steady employment due to the country being mired in its first recession since World War II. Depressed, he festers in his apartment, biding his time with cheap pranks, gambling, liquor and cigarettes. Kaiji is always thinking about money and his perpetual poverty frequently brings him to tears. Kaiji's unrelenting misery continues until he is paid an unexpected visit from a loan shark named Y≈´ji End≈ç who wants to collect an outstanding debt that Kaiji has carelessly co-signed for his former co-worker. End≈ç gives Kaiji two options ‚Äì either spend ten years repaying this outstanding debt, or board the gambling ship Espoir (\\"hope\\" in French) for one night to clear the debt. Using a con, End≈ç pressures Kaiji into accepting the deal, believing he will never come back from the voyage. However, Kaiji survives the gamble and is invited to another gambling night, this time at Starside Hotel. Although initially wary about the offer, he is spurred by his acquaintance Sahara to go. After being the only survivor of the Human Derby, Kaiji decides to avenge his friends by competing in another gambling match the financing corporation known as Teiai Group has prepared: E-Card. Kaiji, despite losing an ear, defeats his opponent Yukio Tonegawa, the second highest ranking executive at Teiai. He goes all-in once again in a new game with Kazutaka Hy≈çd≈ç, the president of Teiai, but this time loses both the money he had won in E-Card and four of his fingers. Though Kaiji survives the events at Starside Hotel he now has a debt of over 9.5 million yen. He contacts End≈ç in hopes of being able to take part in another high-stakes gamble, though End≈ç betrays him and sends him to Teiai's underground labour camp where he will have to work off his debt for 15 years. In the labour camp Kaiji is paid 91,000 perica (equal to 9100 yen) per month to dig an underground kingdom. This is reduced to 45,000 perica after Kaiji loses to ≈åtsuki in Underground Cee-lo. However, Kaiji allies himself with other Forty-fivers (those earning 45,000 perica per month) to defeat ≈åtsuki and win enough money for a one-day outside pass. Although Kaiji manages to get out of the labour camp with 800,000 yen on hand using multiple one-day outside passes, he only has 20 days to earn the 60 million yen he needs to buy his freedom and release the other Forty-fivers. Fortunately, Kaiji comes across K≈çtar≈ç Sakazaki, a man who tells him of a pachinko game known as the Bog in a high-stakes casino where Kaiji can win over 500 million yen. Kaiji agrees to help him beat the Bog. However, the casino is owned by Teiai, and the Bog has been rigged in several ways by the manager of the casino, Seiya Ichij≈ç, and his men to ensure that it won't pay out. Kaiji succeeds at beating the Bog after a long battle and Ichij≈ç is sent to the underground labour camp working for 1050 years to pay back the 700 million yen from the Bog that Kaiji won. Months after the events and finally having cleared his debt, Kaiji has been living with Sakazaki and his family until he kicks Kaiji out with 3 million yen in cash. Kaiji then agrees to help the former Forty-fivers Miyoshi and Maeda beat Takashi Muraoka, the president of a casino at his Minefield Mahjong game and potentially win over 100 million yen. After losing sums of money during the game, Kaiji realizes that the game was rigged from the start in Muraoka's favor, with Maeda looking at Kaiji's tiles and giving information to Muraoka and Miyoshi sending false signals to Kaiji. Kazuya Hy≈çd≈ç, the son of Kazutaka Hy≈çd≈ç, who was in the same room with Kaiji and the rest, loans him money to continue gambling, and after several matches, Kaiji is finally able to defeat Muraoka and wins 480 million yen through a pure stroke of luck. Kazuya offers Kaiji an opportunity to gamble with him, to which Kaiji accepts and follows him. Kazuya reveals to Kaiji his twisted and bloodthirsty personality and how despicable he thinks human beings are. He decides to test his view on human nature with a life-or-death game called Salvation Game, with three friends indebted to him, Mario, Chang and Mitsuyama, and see if their friendship is a true bond. Kaiji is an observer to this game and cheers on the three men to challenge Kazuya's corrupted views. However, after several rounds, Mitsuyama ends up failing to put his trust into his friends and betrays them, taking all the money of the game and leaving them behind to die. Kaiji instinctively saves Mario and Chang from death, and before going with Kazuya to a warehouse and do their gamble, Kaiji asks them to join and support him to defeat Kazuya. Kaiji and Kazuya play a game called One Poker, and after several matches with Kaiji close to death, he finally overthrows Kazuya. Nevertheless Kaiji, in an act of mercy, saves Kazuya from dying with the help of Mario and Chang. While Kazuya lies unconscious, they escape with 2.4 billion yen. Enraged after he found out what happened, Hy≈çd≈ç commands the blacksuits and End≈ç to chase after them and get the money back.  Gambles  ;Series 1 ; :The gambling tournament during the night Kaiji spends on Espoir, has an average survival rate of 50%. The rules were outlined after the issuing of war funds, which were done a minimum of 1,000,000¬• and 10,000,000¬•. The money was in effect a loan, equaling the debt of the contestant and compounded at 1.5% every ten minutes for the four-hour voyage; contestants who hold onto their funds for the length of the trip would have to pay 140% of what they invested, thus putting an incentive to finish games early. Money that exceeded the amount needed to repay the loan to the Espoir hosts would be pocketed by the contestant. :The rules of the game are similar to the original rock‚Äìpaper‚Äìscissors game but with a twist ‚Äì the hand gestures are represented by cards, and contestants are given twelve cards, four of each gesture. Contestants are also given three plastic stars as collateral to bet on each round of play ‚Äì whenever a player loses a round, the winner gets a star from the loser. To survive the night, contestants must retain their three star pendants and use all of their gesture cards. Cards cannot be destroyed or thrown away, to do so is subject to instant disqualification. :Due to the simple nature of the game, single matches can be completed within ten seconds, and players can win or lose in a matter of minutes. Winners are allowed to go upstairs, where any extra star pendants are exchanged for cash and they lounge in a small cafe. In the event of a loss, individuals are taken away to a back room by men in black suits. ; :The gamble seen during Kaiji's competition at the Starside Hotel, consisting of two parts ‚Äì and . In contrast to Restricted Rock, Paper, Scissors, contestants are not briefed on the rules of the Human Derby, and are unaware of the nature of the gamble until they accept participating in it. Contestants are loaded into numbered \\"coffins\\" and are elevated several floors up the Starside Hotel to a platform overlooking a concrete courtyard. Contestants are expected to walk across four long, steel beams ‚Äì the first to arrive on the other side of the beam nets 20,000,000¬•, the second place finisher 10,000,000¬•. The steel beams become more narrow as the contestants begin to cross them, though touching the beam with hands at any time disqualifies the contestant. The pushing of contestants to get out of the way is not forbidden but is in fact encouraged, since the contestants (the \\"horses\\") are being bet on by spectators below, who enjoy the struggle to the other side. Contestants who fall from the beams suffer severe injury ‚Äì depending on how and where they land, their injuries can range from serious to fatal. :Once the winners of the first leg of the race have been identified, they are given coupons redeemable for their prize with a set time limit. To cash the coupons, the contestants must cross similar but more dangerous steel beams twenty two stories or 75 meters above the ground and 25 meters long. Falling from this narrow bridge means instant death. Since the hosts concluded that the crossing of the bridge would not be entertaining if the contestants could give up and use their hands to assist in their retreat off the bridge, a strong electric current is run through the steel beams ‚Äì while not powerful enough to cause serious injury or be fatal, the current is enough to stun contestants, causing them to lose balance and fall from the bridge. Psychologically, this bridge is much more challenging because of the greater peril involved. What's more the end of the bridge is not the end goal. Rather a glass stairway is set up at the end that reveals the true end goal but due to the dark lighting, it's hard to make out and requires a leap of faith in order to reach. ; :E-Card (Emperor Card) is a card game similar to Restricted Rock, Paper, Scissors in that it uses three card types: the , the , and the . The game is meant to be a simplification of society that Kazutaka Hy≈çd≈ç refers to right before the game begins. The Emperor has ultimate power to give money (i.e. most powerful card). Citizens cannot disobey him because they want money (i.e. Emperor card beats the Citizen card). The Slave has nothing to lose and has no use of money, therefore the slave can defeat the Emperor (i.e. Slave card beats the Emperor card but loses to the Citizen card). Each hand is played with one side having four Citizen cards and an Emperor card (Emperor side). The other side having four Citizen cards and a Slave card (Slave side). Since it is much harder for the slave side to win (as Slave cards can only defeat Emperor cards) the players of the Slave side get five times more winnings. The game consists of 12 matches, 4 sets of three, where the players alternate between the Slave side and the Emperor side. In each set of 3 rounds, each player must place down one of the 5 cards in their hand until one emerges as the winner of that match. As Kaiji did not have enough money to match the bet, he was given the choice of losing an eye or an ear instead. ; :Unlike the other gambles, this gamble is made by Kaiji himself. After completing E-Card he prepares to leave the hotel but then steps on a tissue box and notices that its sides are open, which he finds fascinating. Upon further investigation of the box Kaiji decides to challenge Hy≈çd≈ç to a raffle gamble with the tissue box as the container for the lots made of small torn squares of paper towel. The winning piece had a circle drawn on it. ;Series 2 ; :A variation on the dice game, Cee-lo, this game was crafted by ≈åtsuki, the foreman of Kaiji's work team in the underground labor camp. Notable rule variations include that the dealer is not fixed and each player can take a turn as dealer. However, each player may opt to pass their turn as dealer, but if they agree to play dealer, then they must be dealer two consecutive times. ; :An elaborate Pachinko game in a high-stakes casino featuring a payout of 100% of the earnings from the machine. Taking this into consideration the house has set up state-of-the-art countermeasures to ensure victory; such as tightening the nails to ensure only 1 in 100 balls go in, using flippers to knock away balls, and tilting the three bottom plates to prevent any balls dropping through the winning holes. Previously only two people have ever beaten the Bog; Hy≈çd≈ç and Tonegawa. Each ball is worth 1000 times more than a normal Pachinko machine, ¬•4000 (around $39), but the payout is 100 million Pachinko balls, each worth ¬•4000 (around $39). When Kaiji first comes across the Bog the jackpot is ¬•550 million but when he plays it, the jackpot has risen to over ¬•700 million. ;Series 3 ; :A variation of Japanese Mahjong where the game is played by two players who make their best hand from a random draw of 34 tiles. Players do not draw a tile as usual, but instead take turns discarding the 17 leftover tiles from the 34 tiles used to build their hands. Because no tiles are drawn, a hand can only be won by declaring ron on a winning tile discarded by the opponent. A winning hand must reach mangan or higher in order to be valid. If neither player achieves ron after 17 turns, the game becomes a draw, the tiles are reshuffled, and the current wager is doubled. ;Series 4 ; :A game that appears in the in-universe novel written by Kazuya Hy≈çd≈ç. The novel is actually based on the punishments that Kazuya actually enforced, with a changed setting and character names, making the story ostensibly fictional. The gamble uses two boxes with two sword holes in the feet and five in the body, nine steel plates and nine swords. Two players go into their respective boxes and take turns designating the holes into which the swords will be pierced. The player can choose their own hole as well as their opponent's. In addition, 9 of the 14 holes have a steel plate in them, so that even if the sword is stabbed into one of the holes, it will not pierce the body, so if all nine swords are stabbed into holes with a steel plate, both players will end up unharmed. However, the remaining five holes do not have an iron plate in them, and stabbing a sword in one of them will stab the player, which will result in serious injury in the case of the legs, and death, though not necessarily instantaneous, in the case of the body. ; :A life-or-death game designed by Kazuya to test if the friendship between three men indebted to Kazuya--Mario, from the Philippines, Chang, from China, and Mitsuyama, from Japan--is a true bond. The three men sit in a stair case formation, strapped to their seats with seat belts which can only be released one at a time with a release button, and are not allowed to look behind them. They each wear a helmet with a light on the top. At the start of each round of the game, the current pot is doubled, and of the three men, one \\"savior\\" and two \\"hostages\\" is decided via the light on their helmets. The savior must release their seat belt after 30 seconds, but before 60, and press a button across the room, otherwise the helmets of the two hostages will crush their heads. They must use the powers of deduction and observation to determine if they are the savior or the hostage--the player at the top of the staircase is in the best position for this, as he can see the two other players' lights. Halfway through the game, Kazuya reveals that, if the savior fails to rescue the two hostages, he gets double the entire pot of the current round. Kaiji is brought in as an observer to this game, and frequently cheers on the three men and challenges Kazuya's corrupted view of human nature. ;Series 5 ; : A card game using two standard decks of playing cards, designed by Kazuya. Rather than deciding the victor via hands such as Straight, Flush, etc., each hand consists of just one card and is ranked according to its normal value, suits not factoring into the value at all. In addition, like in the earlier E-Card game, the absolute weakest card actually beats the absolute strongest card--a 2 is the absolute weakest, and an ace is the absolute strongest, so the 2 wins against an ace. If both players play a card of equal value, it is a tie. At the start of each round, players have two cards, and must play one of them, the most valuable card being the winner. Lights in front of each player indicate whether their cards are \\"up\\" (higher value) or \\"down\\" (lower value). Standard poker betting rules apply and the cards of both players are always revealed after betting even if one player folds (but they don't affect the outcome in that case). In addition, all of this is played at the top of a large tower, on a mechanical shuffling table Kazuya has designed, which he names \\"Mother Sophie\\". The table is placed on a set of tracks, and moves towards the loser's side's edge with each loss. ;Movies ; :An original gamble that appears in the live-action film Kaiji 2. The attraction, which takes place in the underworld casino where Ichij≈ç is the manager, is the \\"New Brave Men Road\\" which replaces Steel Beam Crossing. Originally named \\"The Princess and the Tiger,\\" based on a novel by Frank R. Stockton, the name was changed due to the tigers being changed into lions for the movie. The game involves a \\"slave\\" (heavily indebted challenger) being trapped with his feet shackled in a room with no way out in front of three cages and buttons. The slave can press only one of the three buttons, which open a cage corresponding to it. If the cage containing a \\"princess\\" (the challenger's companion) is opened, the slave will be released with 30 million in prize money, but the other cages contain lions who will attack and kill the slave if freed. The princess is notified on the spot which button is the right one, and can inform the slave about it. However, there is no guarantee that the princess will truthfully tell the slave which is the correct button, because if the slave dies, she will be awarded 3 million. The slave must correctly determine the truth of the princess's statement or else endanger his life. There doesn't appear to be any reason for the princess to betray the slave in terms of the amount of money they can get, but since the slaves are supposed to be chosen from those who are heavily indebted, even if they win the 30 million, it is assumed that most if not all of the amount will go towards paying off the debt. ; :An original game that appears in the live-action film Kaiji: Final Game. Participants compete for cards stuck to the tops of sticks erected around the city. ; :An original game that appears in the live-action film Kaiji: Final Game. Players select one of the ten ropes and get dropped in a bungee jumping fashion. There is a one-in-ten chance that the person who picked the right rope will be able to survive, but the others will fall from a high ground to their deaths. ; :An original game that appears in the live-action film Kaiji: Final Game. Two participants, who are in a rivalry with each other in terms of assets, convert all of their wealth into gold bars and compete to weigh them on a scale. The main feature of this game is that the players can attach supporters to the game, and the key is for the player to be able to persuade their opponent's supporters to join their own team. There are three main types of supporters: \\"Friends,\\" \\"Fixers,\\" and \\"Family,\\" who can turn cash, works of art, land deeds, and other valuables into gold bars using a state-of-the-art grading machine. There is also a \\"Fan\\" type where the spectators vote by throwing gold coins into the scale of the side they think will win. The gold coins are numbered so that it is clear who threw them into which scale. If the winning side gets voted on when the polls close, they will receive twice the amount of their lump sum. However, if voted with a gold coin and it falls to the ground without being placed on the scale, it will be forfeited by Teiai. ; :An original game that appears in the live-action film Kaiji: Final Game. This is a gamble that K≈çsuke Takakura frequently plays for entertainment purposes, with the rules not deviating much from those of a normal rock-paper-scissors game, but the player must hold a handful of solid gold in one of the three rounds of the game, which means they must play Rock in at least one of those rounds. If the player holds the gold and wins with Rock, they can get that gold as a bonus. Production At the start of serialization, Nobuyuki Fukumoto was 37, and he had a track record of gambling manga, including Ten, Akagi and Gin to Kin. Originally, it was planned to be a short story based on the first game of the series, \\"restricted rock‚Äìpaper‚Äìscissors\\", but Fukumoto told to his chief editor at Kodansha that he found it difficult to fit the story in a few chapters. Eventually, the plan to make it a serialized manga was decided in November 1995, and Kaiji began in Weekly Young Magazine in February 1996. Fukumoto stated that the original project did not have the main character's name as the series' title, and he named him so because he \\"did not want to make it so cool\\", and wanted a \\"dull\\" name. Assuming that people who will read Kaiji are not familiar with gambling manga, Fukumoto has stated that he created original gambling games in the series because they are easier to process than already existing games, allowing him to make simple and easy rules, adding as well that anything can become a gamble having an original game, and he can draw something surprising or interesting for the readers. To create a new game, Fukumoto first comes up with an idea and then a way to beat it, taking time to prepare tricks in order to win in a creative way, noting that persistence is key in the process. Kaiji, and most of Fukumoto's other works as well, are drawn in a \\"cartoonish and loose\\" style. Fukumoto uses techniques like shake up the character's eyeballs and face to express their feelings. The titular character is drawn \\"sharper\\". Kaiji has an angular face, pointy chin and sharp nose, making it difficult to freehand draw him. Fukumoto uses a ruler and rotates the manuscript paper to draw him. For the antagonists, Fukumoto depicts their \\"ugliness\\" by bringing up a scary look in their eye and \\"threatening teeth\\". Fukumoto uses his trademark onomatopoeia, , to express the characters' uneasiness. He also uses visual metaphors, like making Kaiji jump a large crevice or drawing him into a rushing torrent of water, to express the uneasy atmosphere. Women rarely appear in the series, being Mikoko Sakazaki the most prominent, and their appearance in gambling scenes are even more rarely, as Fukumoto reportedly stated that he did not need women in the gambling world. Nevertheless, in July 2019, Fukumoto started Yami-Mahjong Fighter: Mamiya, a gambling mahjong manga series, in which the protagonist is a female character. The manga portrayals people's psychology in extreme situations, and the characters deal with betrayal and elaborate cons, desperately looking for ways to win. Fukumoto has stated that he can not make manga where the characters readily make friends that they risk their lives for, and his protagonists are always alone, with no friends or followers, and Kaiji himself is frequently betrayed. Fukumoto considered that his antagonists, like Kazutaka Hy≈çd≈ç and Yukio Tonegawa, are bad guys saying cruel things that maybe are true. By making Kaiji reflecting on his life and noticing his own faults, Fukumoto considered that the story is about maturation, as he wanted to draw a story in which the character gains something or changes in some way, so that he would be able to trust a person, even if he was previously betrayed. Media =Manga= Kaiji is written and illustrated by Nobuyuki Fukumoto. The series started in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine issue #11 of 1996 published on February 19, 1996. The manga has currently been divided into six parts: * (1996‚Äì1999, 13 volumes) * (2000‚Äì2004, 13 volumes) * (2004‚Äì2008, 13 volumes) * (2009‚Äì2012, 10 volumes) * (2013‚Äì2017, 16 volumes) * (2017‚Äìpresent, 9 volumes) In August 2018, it was announced at Otakon that the then new brand North American manga publishing company Denpa licensed the first part of the manga Gambling Apocalypse: Kaiji.

Reception =General reception= Manga and anime The manga had 18 million tank≈çbon copies in circulation as of November 2011, over 20 million copies in circulation as of July 2012, and over 21.5 million copies in circulation as of January 2019. Individual volumes have been featured in Oricon's weekly charts of best-selling manga every year from 2009 through 2018.References for each year:       Kaiji is a popular series in Japan, and like Nobuyuki Fukumoto's other work Akagi, it has a cult following overseas. In 1998, along with S≈çten K≈çro, the manga won the 22nd Kodansha Manga Award in the General category. In February 2015, Japanese website Goo Ranking conducted a \\"Top 10\\" online web poll of the \\"Best Cerebral Anime\\", where Kaiji ranked #2 behind Death Note. Live-action films At the Japanese box office, the first two live-action Kaiji films grossed (), including for Kaiji and for Kaiji 2. Overseas, the two films grossed , including $460,073 for Kaiji overseas and $68,175 for Kaiji 2 in Singapore. Kaiji: Final Game has grossed in Japan, bringing the worldwide box office gross of the Kaiji film trilogy to . The Chinese film adaptation Animal World also grossed () in China, bringing the worldwide box office gross of all film adaptations to approximately . In September 2011, Goo Ranking conducted a web poll of \\"Live-Action Manga/Anime Adaptations That Worked\\" and the first Kaiji film ranked #6 out of 38 live-action adaptations. =Critical reception= Michael Toole of Anime News Network praised the narrative of Kaiji, stating that \\"the series is run through with entertaining lowlifes, odd situations, and intoxicating moments of suspense\\". Bradley Meek of THEM Anime Reviews said that Kaiji is \\"one of the most unique anime I've ever seen, and I don't expect to see anything like it again\\". He praised the series' \\"ingenious games\\", depicting them as \\"devilishly clever and depend as much on the psychology of the players as it does strategy\\". Meek also wrote that the theme of the series is \\"the rich always screw over the poor\\" and the games could be seen as a \\"direct form social commentary\\". David Smith of IGN praised the games' rules development and strategies, but said that watching the titular protagonist \\"trip and fall into obvious traps is more than a little frustrating\\". Regarding the tone of the series, Theron Martin of Anime News Network wrote that the first episode of its second season \\"wars between being a psychological character study and just clinically depressing\\", and that could be a \\"turn-off\\", noting that the series is aimed at an older male audience. Gia Manry of the same website ranked the titular character second on her list of \\"Anime Characters with Terrible Karma\\". In comparing Kaiji to other gambling series like Fukumoto's other work Akagi, Shinobu Kaitani's One Outs or F≈´mei Sai's Legendary Gambler Tetsuya, John Oppliger of AnimeNation considered that Kaiji appeals to a wider audience due to its depiction of a variety of high-stakes games instead of focusing on a single kind of game, and due to the fact that the aforementioned series star \\"a prodigy rather than an ordinary guy\\", but stated that a \\"skilled gamesmanship\\" viewer could be disappointed with Kaiji by the \\"extensive reliance on coincidence, deus ex machina, and authorial manipulation\\" that \\"substitutes for intelligence and strategy\\". Norbert Daniels Jr. of Anime News Network wrote that Kaiji's story should resonate with American millennials and help them understand their common plight with the Lost Generation of Japan, adding: \\"Kaiji tells us that if we learn to stick together, we'll hit our jackpot eventually. Just like the show says, ‚ÄúThe future is in our hands‚Äù\\". The series' art style has been particularly commented by reviewers. Toole described Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor as \\"fantastically ugly\\" and \\"cheaply animated\\", and Martin stated that it uses a \\"very old-school artistic style\\", noting the use of \\"noses that are either huge or lethally sharp, extra-heavy lines in the character designs, and limited animation\\". In another article, Martin said that the simplicity of the series' animation is \\"pretty clearly calculated\\" and \\"heavily stylized\\" due to Fukumoto's original work. God Len of Japanator wrote that the artwork \\"is quite ‚Äòunique‚Äô to say the least. Noses are long, heads are misshapen, and something about their teeth really scares me. This look might be bad for most series out there today, but for Kaiji it works. The most important part is that it is consistent; and as long as its consistent, it works for me. Anyways, gamblers are supposed to be ugly\\". Daryl Surat of Otaku USA, commented that Fukumoto's \\"exaggerated facial expressions and contortions\\" of his character's design allows \\"selling the peaks and valleys of emotion that go with gambling matters of life, death, and big money\\". He also highlighted Fukumoto's trademark sound effect \\"Zawa Zawa\\", used to \\"denote minds ill at ease\\" and the \\"highly talkative and hard-selling\\" narrator, used to explain \\"how a big a deal everything is with a suitable mix of gravitas, bombast, and wild metaphor that is invariably realized through an outlandish fantasy visual\\". Crunchyroll listed the second season Kaiji: Against All Rules among the best anime series of 2011, with reviewer Joseph Luster commenting, \\"Ideally, Kaiji would be super popular in North America. I'd certainly like to think it would blow up if someone licensed it, but who knows. Still, if you managed to catch the second season this year, you know how dangerously addictive it can be. Zawa zawa, indeed\\".

It is derived from fluorescein, but differs by the presence of four bromine atoms at positions 2, 4, 5 and 7 of the xanthene ring and four chlorine atoms in the carboxyphenyl ring. It has an absorption maximum around 540 nm and an emission maximum around 564 nm. Apart from industrial use, phloxine B has functions as an antimicrobial substance, viability dye and biological stain. For example, it is used in hematoxylin-phloxine-saffron (HPS) staining to color the cytoplasm and connective tissue in shades of red.  Antimicrobial properties  = Lethal dosage levels = In the presence of light, phloxine B has a bactericidal effect on gram-positive strains, such as Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, and several methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains. At a minimum inhibitory concentration of 25 ŒºM, growth is reduced by 10-fold within 2.5 hours. At concentrations of 50 ŒºM and 100 ŒºM, growth is stopped completely and cell counts decrease by a factor of 104 to 105. For humans, the Food and Drug Administration deems phloxine B to be safe up to a daily dosage of 1.25 mg/kg. = Mechanism of action = Bacteria exposed to phloxine B die from oxidative damage. Phloxine B ionizes in water to become a negatively charged ion that binds to positively charged cellular components . When phloxine B is subjected to light, debromination occurs and free radicals and singlet oxygen are formed. These compounds cause irreversible damage to the bacteria, leading to growth arrest and cell death. Gram-negative bacteria are phloxine B-resistant due to the outer cell membrane that surrounds them. This polysaccharide-coated lipid bilayer creates a permeability barrier that prevents efficient uptake of the compound. Addition of EDTA, which is known to strip the lipopolysaccharides and increase membrane permeability, removes the phloxine B resistance and allows gram-negative bacteria to be killed as well.  Measure of viability  Phloxine B can be used to stain dead cells of several yeasts, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. When diluted in yeast growth media, the dye is unable to enter cells because of their membranes. Dead yeast cells lose membrane integrity, so phloxine B can enter and stain the intracellular cytosolic compounds. Therefore, staining is a measure of cell death. In cell counting assays, the number of fluorescent (i.e. dead) cells observed through a haemocytometer can be compared to the total number of cells to give a measure of mortality. The same principle can be applied at higher throughput by fluorescence-activated flow cytometry (FACS), where all phloxine B-stained cells in a sample are counted.

The war was fought between white settlers in Illinois and present-day Wisconsin and Sauk Chief Black Hawk. The relatively minor attacks of the war were widely dispersed and often carried out by bands of Native Americans that were unaffiliated with Black Hawk's British Band. Sometime in May 1832 a Methodist minister and his wife disappeared and were subsequently tied to a tree and executed by burning by a band of Potawatomi. Also in May an attack at Holderman's Grove killed another minister, Adam Payne, and an attack at Hollenbeck's Grove drove numerous residents out of the area. In another attack, just before the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, a German immigrant named Henry Apple was killed in a Kickapoo ambush. At Ament's Cabin, near present- day Bureau County, Illinois, an attack left early settler Elijah Phillips dead. Together with other incidents during the war, these attacks helped contribute to an atmosphere of fear in the region during the war. Background As a consequence of an 1804 treaty between the Governor of Indiana Territory and a group of Sauk and Fox leaders regarding land settlement, the tribes vacated their lands in Illinois and moved west of the Mississippi in 1828. However, Sauk Chief Black Hawk and others disputed the treaty, claiming that the full tribal councils had not been consulted, nor did those representing the tribes have authorization to cede lands. Angered by the loss of his birthplace, between 1830-31 Black Hawk led a number of incursions across the Mississippi River into Illinois, but was persuaded to return west each time without bloodshed. In April 1832, encouraged by promises of alliance with other tribes and the British, he again moved his so-called \\"British Band\\" of around 1,000 warriors and non-combatants into Illinois.Lewis, James. \\"The Black Hawk War of 1832 ,\\" Abraham Lincoln Digitization Project, Northern Illinois University.

The conflict became known as the Black Hawk War. The period between initial battle at Stillman's Run and the June 24 Battle of Apple River Fort was filled with war-related activity and events. A series of attacks at Buffalo Grove, the Plum River settlement, Fort Blue Mounds, and various attacks in other places including the war's most famous incident the Indian Creek massacre, all took place between mid-May and late June 1832.\\"May 21, Indian Creek, Ill.: Abduction of the Hall Sisters,\\" Historic Diaries: The Black Hawk War, Wisconsin State Historical Society.

Prelude After the defeat of the militia at Stillman's Run the number of Native American raids and attacks increased on the frontier in the state of Illinois and Michigan Territory. Largely, these attacks were opportunistic and spread out as opposed to being part of a bigger strategy.

Execution of Lucy and James Sample Execution of James and Lucy Sample. In 1872, amateur historian Nehemiah Matson related a story about the execution of a couple, James and Lucy Sample, by Potawatomis. According to Matson, the two were bound to a tree and then burned to death. The executions, said Matson, were directed by a man named Mike Girty, who was supposedly a mixed race son of Simon Girty.Nehemiah Matson, Reminiscences of Bureau County: In Two Parts, (Princeton, Illinois: Republican Book and Job Office, 1872), 93‚Äì103.

Holderman's Grove  Adam Payne was an itinerant preacher from Pennsylvania, described as a large and imposing man.Trask, Black Hawk: The Battle for the Heart of America, pp. 206 Two days after the May 21 Indian Creek massacre, the Payne was traveling by horseback on what would later become the Frank & Walker stagecoach route, from Chicago to Ottawa. Payne, a minister in a denomination known as the Dunkers, passed through several areas including Holderman's Grove, Lisbon and Plainfield, Illinois. At Plainfield Payne was met by a friend, Johnathan Wilson, who warned him of danger to individuals traveling the Illinois frontier alone. Payne was at first persuaded and turned back toward Chicago at Wilson's urgings.Armstrong, Perry A. The Sauks and the Black Hawk War (Google Books), H.W. Rokker: 1887, pp. 399-403\\\\.

Payne's journey was uneventful until he approached Holderman's Grove. Payne approached the grove, about halfway between Plainfield and Ottawa, when he was ambushed by a waiting war party of Native Americans. They immediately fired their weapons and Payne was wounded through the chest. He turned his horse to flee but it was also wounded in the encounter and after a chase of 14 or 15 miles it fell dead beneath him. Unarmed, Payne was overtaken by the attackers and purportedly decapitated, one witness to the body's discovery indicated that he was only scalped and his head remained attached to his body.Blanchard, Rufus.

Hollenbeck's Grove The house of a Mr. Hollenbeck was burned in Hollenbeck's Grove (or Hollenback's) on May 22, 1832, one day after the Indian Creek massacre. Other parts of the settlement at the grove were also burned and looted. Refugees from Hollenbeck's Grove joined the exodus from the Fox River valley toward Danville, passing through Plainfield on their way.

Retrieved 14 August 2007. On the way to Hamilton, the soldiers passed a German immigrant, Henry Apple, exchanged greetings and kept traveling. About from the spot they met a Kickapoo ambush was set up in wait, probably for Dodge, who had ventured off the main road. Apple approached the ambush site and Dodge later reported hearing three guns, one of the shots killed Apple. Dodge was probably saved by his last minute decision to make a detour from the main route. Apple's horse galloped wildly past the men, wounded and carrying a large amount of blood in its saddle. The horse continued all the way to Fort Hamilton, where it raised a furor among the inhabitants. After hearing the attack on Apple in the distance, Dodge continued on toward Fort Hamilton (present-day Wiota, Wisconsin), gathered a company of 29 mounted volunteers on arrival and sped off to intercept that band. He led the chase through tangled underbrush until, breaking into prairie, they caught sight of the raiding party. The Kickapoo crossed the Pecatonica River within sight of the pursuing militia, and entered into a swamp. The militia crossed the swollen river and dismounted when they reached the swamp and the Battle of Horseshoe Bend ensued. Ament's Cabin The site of Ament's cabin was settled in 1829 when John L. Ament and his brother Justin staked claim on adjacent claims Berlin and Dover Townships, in present-day Bureau County, Illinois. Shortly after settling, Elijah Phillips bought Justin Ament's land and built his own cabin.Past and Present of Bureau County, Illinois, \\"History of Berlin,\\" Pioneer Publishing, Chicago: 1906, p. 118.

The camp was a place where Native Americans lived during the winter and spring on an annual basis. Prior to the attack, both Ament and Phillips were warned by Potawatomi chief Shabbona of impending danger to the settlers along Bureau Creek. The men had fled, with their families, leaving their goods and livestock behind. Eventually, it was decided that it was safe to return to the settlement to tend to the deserted possessions. On the morning of either June 17 or June 18, the band of about 30 Native Americans returned to their hidden positions of the day before and awaited the settlers. When the settlers awoke Brigham and Phillips went onto the porch of Ament's cabin where they conversed for a few minutes, failing to notice the moccasin tracks around the property. Phillips decided to go to his cabin, about a half mile (.8 km) from Ament's property, to finish a letter to his parents. Brigham, intending to accompany Phillips, entered his cabin for a moment, when he did he heard the crack of a rifle outside. Phillips dropped to the ground, struck by two musket balls, and the band of raiding Native Americans immediately descended upon him with their tomahawks.Matson, Nehemiah.

Other incidents Aside from these various attacks and murders there were a number of other small attacks and skirmishes throughout the duration of the Black Hawk War.

Retrieved 1 August 2007. At the end of June, following the attack on Ament's Cabin and important battles at Waddams Grove and Horseshoe Bend, two militia members were killed at Sinsinawa Mound in present-day southern Wisconsin. Aftermath Collectively, these attacks served to spread fear throughout the region, especially in northeastern Illinois around the area of the Indian Creek massacre where a wave of terror gripped the region. Into the lead mining region around Galena, Illinois anxiety spread as attacks occurred and news of the movements of the elusive Black Hawk poured in. After the death of Adam Payne no white settlers in the area really felt safe. The various attacks in May, following Stillman's Run helped contribute to the region's growing fear as well as an exodus from the area near the incidents. In the case of the attack that killed Henry Apple, the result was a battle which helped sway the course of the militia's morale and public confidence in the force. The attack at Ament's Cabin led to a small chase of the attackers but nothing came of it and the remains of Elijah Phillips were returned to Hennepin, Illinois for burial.

It was founded in autumn of 1994 by Jeff Dufresne and Sandra Hall as a high school for newly arrived immigrants to the city of Saint Paul. Its student body is 100% immigrant and range in ages from 14 to 21. Its present principal is Rose Santos who has held this office since 2003. History \\"LEAP\\" stands for Limited English Achievement Program and from 1994 to 2005, LEAP school was known as LEAP English Academy. However, with the influx of new immigrants from the Wat Tham Krabok refugee camp in Thailand, the name was changed to reflect a more clear image and mission of the school. The original location of the school was on the 4th floor of the 494 Sibley Avenue building in Saint Paul. In August 2003 the school was moved to its present location of 631 Albert Street North, where it shared the building with the students and staff of the Wilson Middle School. During the summer of 2004, with the anticipation of new students arriving to Saint Paul, IA-LEAP was allowed to take over the entire building and, for unrelated reasons, the middle school component was closed. This building was named after the United States President Woodrow Wilson and dates back to 1924.As stated on a plaque inside the Wilson Building. Originally, the building was called Woodrow Wilson Junior High School, and has since changed its name several times, such as Wilson High School, Wilson Elementary, Expo Middle School, and variations of the same theme.

Mail deliveries have been made to either school name. Mission and student body LEAP serves students who are newly arrived immigrants to the United States and have a limited understanding of the English language. But for these students who are pursuing their high school diploma, there is the additional problem of not understanding the background knowledge of a core subject that they would have learned had they been in an American educational system in their early years. Such core subject areas could be, United States and World history, science, economics, mathematics, etc., which may have had a different focus, or even not taught at all in their home countries. LEAP school focuses on not only the teaching of English, but also at the same time teaching these core subjects in preparation for their high school diploma. The present student population is approximately 65% Hmong, with the rest of the student representing the Somali, Latino, Liberian, Karen, Laotian, Sudanese, Oromo, Amhara, Filipino, Vietnamese, Latvian, Chinese, Romanian, Arab (United Arab Emirates) and other communities.ALC International Academy - LEAP http://www.leap.spps.org/School_Profile.html.

The group comprised multi-instrumentalist Gene Parsons, guitarist Clarence White, singer-guitarist-fiddler Gib Guilbeau and bassist Wayne Moore. Parsons and White left the band to join The Byrds while Guilbeau and Parsons later joined the Flying Burrito Brothers. Along with the International Submarine Band, The Byrds and The Flying Burrito Brothers, Nashville West was among the pioneering groups of the country rock genre. An album by Nashville West was released in 1978, about ten years after the band had broken up. The material on the Nashville West album was recorded during a club date in 1968. The album was released again 2003 on Rev-ola, a division of Cherry Red Records. History =Formation= In the mid-1960s, Gene Parsons and fiddler Gib Guilbeau, who had been earlier acquainted from their time together in a band called the Castaways, were hired for a recording session with the Gosdin Brothers' singing duo of Vern and Rex Gosdin. The session, being produced by The Byrds' Chris Hillman, included guitarist Clarence White, who had formerly played bluegrass guitar in the Kentucky Colonels. Parsons, Guilbeau and White then went on to play on sessions together for several other country music artists and became the house band for Gary S. Paxton's record label, Bakersfield International Productions. In the course of their session work, Parsons and White devised the B-Bender, or Stringbender, a system installed on White's Fender Telecaster that made the instrument sound like a pedal steel guitar. Eventually, Parsons, Guilbeau and White became a band, joining with fellow session player, bassist-vocalist Wayne Moore, who played in the Castaways with Parsons and Guilbeau. The group was known by various names, including The Reasons, Gib Guilbeau and The Reasons, the Gary Paxton Band or Cajun Gib and Gene. The Nashville West moniker was taken from the name of the El Monte, California club where they sat as the house band, and was the name of an instrumental song composed by Parsons and White. =Break up= Parsons and White were then asked to join The Byrds in 1969. White had already played on 1968's The Notorious Byrd Brothers and Sweetheart of the Rodeo. After Chris Hillman split from the Byrds with Michael Clarke and Gram Parsons (no relation to Gene) to form the Flying Burrito Brothers, White and Gene Parsons joined Roger McGuinn and John York to become full-fledged members of The Byrds. The resulting next album, Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde, featured White's and Parsons' signature instrumental tune, \\"Nashville West\\". White and Parsons were with the Byrds for the albums Live at the Fillmore - February 1969, Ballad of Easy Rider, (Untitled), Byrdmaniax and Farther Along. When the original line-up of The Byrds reunited in March 1973 to record Byrds, White left the Byrds to join the bluegrass supergroup Muleskinner. He also played on a package tour with several other country rock pioneers at the time, including Gram Parsons. White then reformed his old band, the Kentucky Colonels, with his brothers, but was killed on July 14, 1973 in Palmdale, California, when he was struck by a car driven by a drunken driver. Guilbeau went on to play sessions with Linda Ronstadt and joined a band called Swampwater. He also played with Sneaky Pete Kleinow in a group called Cold Steel. In 1974, Guilbeau and Gene Parsons joined the Flying Burrito Brothers. Album As a session band, Nashville West recorded prolifically, though never under the Nashville West name, backing other artists on Gary S. Paxton's record label. However, in 1978, an album under the name Nashville West was eventually released on the Sierra Records label. The material on it came from a 1967 club date in El Monte, California, which had been recorded by Parsons for personal use, and not necessarily for album release. The songs include an instrumental reading of Bobbie Gentry's \\"Ode to Billie Joe\\". \\"I had a Sony two-track, and I hooked it up, partly to the sound system and partly to the microphones, and just let it run and recorded the whole night,\\" Parsons said. \\"There's a lot that never got on the album, thank goodness.\\" The album was reissued on CD by Sierra in 1997, and added four more tracks not included on the LP edition: \\"C.C.

Biography A son of King Alexander II of Kakheti by his wife Tinatin n√©e Amilakhvari, Constantine was taken in his childhood to Persia where he was converted to Islam, brought up at the court, and lived for many years. When envoys from his father Alexander II, Simon I of Kartli, and Manuchir II of Samtskhe arrived at the Safavid court between 1596 and 1597 with many gifts, including slave boys and girls, Constantine entertained them. He served as a darugha (prefect) of the royal city of Qazvin and then of Isfahan (1602‚Äì1603). In 1604, Shah Abbas I of Persia appointed him as the governor and commander of Shirvan to fight the Ottoman forces there, and ordered him to secure the Kakhetian participation in the campaign. As Alexander II was reluctant to engage in this conflict, Constantine, accompanied by a sizable Persian entourage, arrived in Kakheti, being honorably met by his father and elder brother George at a camp near the town of Zagem (Bazari). On March 12, 1605, during the negotiations, Constantine murdered Alexander and George, and declared himself King of Kakheti. However, his subjects refused to recognize a patricide and revolted. The rebellion was led by Ketevan, widow of Constantine‚Äôs brother David I, who requested aid from his relative King George X of Kartli. Constantine succeeded in bribing some of the rebel nobles, and, on the shah‚Äôs order, led a combined Kakhetian-Qizilbash army against Shirvan. During the protracted siege of Shemakha, the Kakhetian auxiliaries revolted and made Constantine flee. The rebels sent emissaries to Shah Abbas and pledged loyalty provided that Abbas confirmed their candidate, Ketevan‚Äôs son Teimuraz, as a Christian king of Kakheti. Meanwhile, the Kartlian forces under Prince Papuna Amilakhvari intervened and inflicted a decisive defeat on Constantine‚Äôs army on October 22, 1605. Constantine was killed in battle, and Abbas was forced to acknowledge Teimuraz as a king. –í–∞—Ö—É—à—Ç–∏ –ë–∞–≥—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–æ–Ω–∏ (Vakhushti Bagrationi) (1745). .

Mohammed Khan's son, Bektash (who was therefore Constantine's brother-in-law and cousin at the same time), accompanied Constantine to Kakheti and later became the province's ruler until being overthrown in a rebellion led by Davit Jandieri in 1615.

In his prolific career he has completed a provocative body of work that ranges from abstract to representational and celebrates every facet of the female body. Bell's favorite subject is the female body and land around his former home of Charleston, South Carolina,http://www.charlestoncitypaper.com/charleston/corrigan-gallery- unveils-a-cheeky-new-exhibit/Content?oid=1309582 and those near his current home in the Mexican state of Guanajuato.  Childhood and early career  The youngest of five children of Elwood Bell and Lily Benson, Elwood Cranmer Bell Jr. was born in Wilmington, North Carolina. He began painting at an early age and was commissioned for his first portrait at 11 years old. In 1966, at age 19, he enlisted in the Army. EC Bell attended the University of North Carolina and studied art under Claude Howell, Jack Berkman and with Roy Schmultz in Kaiserslautern where he was influenced by German Expressionism.  Mature career  He has tended to gravitate to several identifiable landscapes to which he has returned repeatedly over a period of decades. He typically begins a painting with a sketch on canvas in pencil followed by a loose brushed wash before executing a finished painting with acrylic paint in washes, drybrush and numerous layers of color. His works have fetched increasingly higher prices with his growing fame, and today Bell's major works sell at an excess of ten thousand dollars from private dealers and at auction. Though the female nude is a classic subject, much of EC Bell's struggle as an artist has been combating narrow-minded attitudes towards erotic art. Bell's delicate approach to the female nude as well as his mastery of form has changed many minds. He lives and works in the art mecca of San Miguel de Allende, Mexico.

He is usually known by his nickname M√© Aktsom \\"Bearded Grandfather\\", which was given to him later in life because he was so hirsute. His father, Tridu Songtsen, died in 704 in battle in Mywa territory in the Kingdom of Nanzhao (, modern lowland Yunnan). The Old Book of Tang states he was on his way to suppress tributary kingdoms on the southern borders of Tibet, including Nepal and parts of India. There was a dispute among his sons but \\"after a long time\\" the people put seven-year-old Trid√© Tsuktsen on the throne. Struggle for the throne It is very unclear, however, from the sources exactly what happened after the death of Tridu Songtsen. According to the Tibetan Annals, \\"he who would be crowned king\\" (i.e. Mes-ag-tshoms?) was born in the spring of 704, just a few months before his father died. Beckwith states that in the winter of 704-705, Lha (\\"Balpho\\" or Lha Balpo), one of the sons of Tridu Songtsen, took the throne, but Thrimal√∂ (), the empress dowager, wife of the second emperor, Mangsong Mangtsen, and mother of Tridu Songtsen, \\"dethroned Lha in favor of the infant Rgyal Gtsug ru, the future Khri gtsug brtsan, popularly known as Mes ag tshoms. Revolts and executions accompanied the virtual coup, but the Annals and Chinese sources have little to report on them. Lha apparently was not killed, but only forced into semiretirement. It was thus, perhaps, the \\"Retired Emperor\\" Lha who actually received and married the Chinese princess Chin-ch'eng in 710.Beckwith, C. I. \\"The Revolt of 755 in Tibet\\", pp. 1-14.

She was known in Tibet as Princess Gyim Shing or Chinese Queen Mother Ong Cho (), or simply \\"Kim Sheng\\", and was a devout Buddhist.

Jincheng died during an outbreak of smallpox sometime between 739 and 741. The rise of anti-Buddhist factions in Tibet following the death of the Chinese princess began to blame the epidemic on the support of Buddhism by the king and queen.Ancient Tibet, p. 253. This forced the monks to flee once again; first to Gandhara, and then to Kosambi in central India where the monks apparently ended up quarreling and killed each other.Hill (1988), pp. 179-180.

In 720 Tibetan troops took the Uighur principality of 'Bug-cor in the Dunhuang oasis.Ancient Tibet, p. 248. The Tang Annals report that in 722 the Tibetans attacked Gilgit (Tib.

However, the Tibetans could have gone through Taglokan region and attacked Gilgit without needing to take Baltistan and Ladakh, as suggested by the paths and trade routes through Shaksgham and through Baltistan.

He then seized the important Chinese fortress of Kva-cu or Guazhou at (Anxi), to the southeast of Dunhuang, which contained supplies for all the Chinese-dominated territories as far as the Western Turks (Dru-gu) to the north and the Tazig (Arabs) to the west, and all this wealth fell into the hands of the Tibetans so that even ordinary Tibetans had fine Chinese silks to dress up in.Snellgrove, David. 1987.

However, the Chinese managed to drive the Tibetans away in 728, after a siege of eighty- days.Ancient Tibet, p. 249. In 724, according to a Chinese encyclopedia of 1013, the Chinese princess, Kim-sheng secretly wrote to the ruler of Kashmir asking for asylum, but apparently nothing came of this. In 730 a peace treaty with China was signed which established the border east of Kokonor at the Chiling Pass in the Red Hills. In 733 Mes-ag-tshoms wrote to the Chinese emperor Xuanzong (r. 712-756) stating that China and Tibet were equally great kingdoms and hoping that peace would endure. In 734 a pillar engraved with the treaty was erected, and although it was apparently torn down soon after, envoys travelled regularly between the Lhasa and Chang'an for the next fifteen years.Ancient Tibet, p. 245. In 736 Tibet again attacked Bru-sha (Gilgit), and the ruler came to Tibet to pay homage. later that year the Chinese also attacked Bru-sha, but in 740 the Tibetan princess Khri-ma-lod married the ruler of Bru-sha. In 738 the 'Nine Loops of the Huang Ho', which had been given to Tibet as part of a dowry, were retaken by the Chinese. In 740, the Chinese also regained control of the key fortress at Anrong, just north of Chengdu, which the Tibetans had held for over sixty years. In 742 the Chinese also managed to recapture the formidable fortress of Shipu, near the border in the Red Hills. In 747 the Chinese, under command of general Gao Xianzhi (of Goguryeo descent), fought the Tibetans and forced them to leave the region. Between 748 and 752, the king of the White Mywa, who formed part of 'Jang (Nanzhao) rebelled against Chinese rule and submitted to the king of Tibet.Snellgrove, David. 1987. Indo-Tibetan Buddhism: Indian Buddhists and Their Tibetan Successors. 2 Vols. Shambhala, Boston, Vol. II, pp. 354, 357, nn. 96 and 97. In 751 The Tibetans again sent troops north of the Jaxartes River (Syr Darya) and helped the Arabs and Qarluq Turks defeat the Chinese at Talas. this decisive battle ended Tang power in the west. Also in 751, Kag-la- bon (r. 748-779), the ruler of 'Jang (Nanzhao) in Yunnan, came to pay his respects to Mes-ag-tshoms. In 753 Mes-ag-tshoms sent him a golden diplomatic seal and in 754 and 756, Tibetan armies were sent to help the Nanzhao fight off the Chinese.Ancient Tibet, p. 250.

However, the anti-Buddhist activities following the death of his Chinese wife, and some mention in the edicts of Trisong Detsen and his son Sadnalegs point to dissension and suppression of Buddhism - at least in the latter part of his reign. Death and succession Mes-ag-tshoms was apparently murdered in a palace revolt sponsored by two ministers in 755, as the pillar erected later at Zhol in front of the Potala states.

It follows the life and adventures of Sun Wukong, the monkey king from the 16th century novel Journey to the West. It was first published by Jade Dynasty and is licensed by Yuk Long Limited.  Summary  A stone monkey is born from the divine rock as a child of the Heaven and Earth. Di Shi Tian, the Jade Emperor who presides over Heaven, orders thunder deity Lei Gong to inflict Heavenly Punishment on the monkey, but Lei Gong is unable to do so. The monkey studies the 73 transformations from Puti Laozu the Master of the Sun, and is given the name Sun Wukong. Lei Gong attempts to eliminate him again with Heavenly Punishment, but Sun uses his abilities to protect his master and his fellow students. Sun receives the title of Bumayun (horsekeeper) from Di Shi Tian, and finds the position to be lowly. He fights with some deities, including Tianpeng Yuanshai. He rescues 108 demons from Pangu's temple. Dashan Ru Lai captures Sun and imprisons him in Mount Wu Xing. Di Shi Tian punishes Sanyan Zhanshen and Beidou-Xingjun for their carelessness. A strange old man provokes Xuanzang. Erlang, the reincarnation of Sanyan Zhanshen, commits many crimes by killing demons, and gets Taizong, the Tang Dynasty Emperor, and his servants involved. Yuchi Gong dies. Xuanzang uses a divine rod to eliminate the demons attacking the emperor. Taizong gives Xuanzang the title of Saintly Monk. Xuanzang recruits Sun Wukong, Zhu Bajie, Sha Wujing and Xiao Bailong to his group and goes on the mission to retrieve the Sanzangjing (\\"Three Collections of (Buddhist) Scriptures\\") from the West. On the way they fight Jinjiao (gold horn) and Yinjiao (Silver Horn). They defeat Jinjiao, kill the Scorpion King, and Hei Nuhou (Black Queen). They become friends with Jinjiao and Tianxun Niang. They challenge Baoluwang. Sun and Baoluwang become sworn brothers. Sun then helps Baoluwang and Feng Hou fight against the Heavenly Punishment. Erlang combines Jimo Yuansu (Ê•µÈ≠îÂÖÉÁ¥†, ultimate demon element) with Baoluwang's son, and transforms him into a jimo. Characters =Sun Wukong= Sun Wukong is a child of the Heaven and the Earth, born from a divine rock. In the early chapters, Di Shi Tian orders the thunder deity Lei Gong to eliminate him, but Lei Gong is unable to. In his youth, Sun leads the monkeys and monsters in the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit and sets camp in Shuilian Cave. After an old monkey dies, Sun travels to the fairy island to learn skills and magic from grandmaster P√∫t√≠, including 73 transformations. Because he gives Puti trouble, he leaves his master and instigates a rebellion against Heaven. While fighting Sanyan Zhanshen, he rescues 108 demons, which angers Di Shi Tian and which provokes Dashan Ru Lai. As a result, he is imprisoned inside Mount Wu Xing. He steals Pangu's Ruyi Jingu Bang staff and eats the empress Tianmu Niangniang's \\"Peaches of Immortality\\". He is based on Sun Wukong from the Journey to the West stories. =Xuanzang's group= Xuanzang (ÁéÑÂ•ò) is the title character of Saint. He is a Buddhist monk who was reincarnated from Jinchanzi, a disciple of Ru Lai. He assembles and leads a group of characters to recover the SƒÅnz√†ngjƒ´ng, the \\"Three Collections of (Buddhist) Scriptures\\". Xuanzang's group includes the following characters: * (Èõ≤Èõ®, lit. \\"Cloud and rain\\"), a pretty demoness that Sun Wukong rescues from Lei Yin Temple. She makes friends with Sun, and when he is confined in Mount Wu Xing, she follows Ru Lai's orders to find Sun's heart and return it to him. When she and Sun fight Bingpo Daxian, she is destroyed to ice dust. Xiaoshan Guanyin promises to revive her. * Xiaobao (Â∞èÂØ∂), an insect demon, is a friend of Sun from his first day with his Grandmaster. * Shawang (Ê≤ôÁéã, lit. \\"Sand king\\"), a demon who was Sha Wujing and Xiao Bailong's master. Although he is forced to help Sun Wukong three times, he later becomes Sun's friend. * (Ë±¨ÂÖ´Êàí or Zhu Daxian Ë±¨Â§ß‰ªô), formerly known as Tianpeng Yuanshuai (Â§©Ëì¨ÂÖÉÂ∏Ö), an exiled deity. He is based on Zhu Bajie. He has a fianc√©e named Gao Ruolan (È´òÂº±Ëò≠), whose name is loosely similar to her Journey to the West counterpart Gao Cuilan (È´òÁø†Ëò≠). * (Ê≤ôÊÇüÂáà or Sha Baonan Ê≤ôÊö¥Áî∑), a former servant of the sand king. He is based on Sha Wujing. * (Â∞èÁôΩÈæç), the prince of the East Sea, and the son of sea king Jiao Ye. He is based on the Bailongma. =Heaven= The Heaven world is ruled by Di Shi Tian.

The Romans first built the seven gates and during their era, the gate was dedicated to Venus. The current gate was reconstructed by the Ayyubids in the 13th century. History Famous historical residents of the borough of Bab Tuma include, Saint Paul (hence expressions such as \\"the road to Damascus experience\\"); Saint Thomas the Apostle himself who, after lending his name to the neighborhood, went on to explore India; Saint Ananias, French writer Alphonse de Lamartine, Greek Orthodox theologian Saint Joseph of Damascus, founder of the Damascus Patriarchal School, Saint Raphael of Brooklyn, the first Eastern Orthodox Bishop of New York City (sent there by the Czar Nicholas II of Russia in 1895), and Syrian-born philosopher Michel Aflaq, founder of the Ba'ath Party and ba'athist ideology. In the 16th century, following the conquest of Antioch and Alexandretta by the Ottoman Empire after the Battle of Marj Dabiq, the borough of Bab Tuma became the seat of the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch and the Melkite Greek Catholic Church for the Northern Levant (Syria, Lebanon and Southern Turkey), as well as internationally for the Syriac Orthodox Church, with Cathedral of Saint George, since 1959.

Sacramentum also referred to a thing that was pledged as a sacred bond, and consequently forfeit if the oath were violated.D. Briquel \\"Sur les aspects militaires du dieu ombrien Fisus Sancius\\" in Revue de l' histoire des religions i p. 150-151; J. A. C. Thomas A Textbook of Roman law Amsterdam 1976 p. 74 and 105. Both instances imply an underlying sacratio, act of consecration. The sacramentum differs from iusiurandum, which is more common in legal application, as for instance swearing an oath in court. A sacramentum establishes a direct relation between the person swearing (or the thing pledged in the swearing of the oath) and the gods; the iusiurandum is an oath of good faith within the human community that is in accordance with ius as witnessed by the gods.Arnaldo Momigliano, Quinto contributo alla storia degli studi classici e del mondo antico (Storia e letteratura, 1975), vol. 2, pp. 975‚Äì977; Luca Grillo, The Art of Caesar's Bellum Civile: Literature, Ideology, and Community (Cambridge University Press, 2012), p. 60. Sacramentum is the origin of the English word \\"sacrament\\", a transition in meaning pointed to by Apuleius's use of the word to refer to religious initiation.Apuleius, Metamorphoses 11.15.5; Robert Schilling, \\"The Decline and Survival of Roman Religion,\\" in Roman and European Mythologies (University of Chicago Press, 1992, from the French edition of 1981) Legal usage In Roman law, a thing given as a pledge or bond was a sacramentum. The sacramentum legis actio was a sum of money deposited in a legal procedureVarro De Lingua latina V 180; Festus s.v. sacramentum p. 466 L; 511 L; Paulus Festi Epitome p.467 L. to affirm that both parties to the litigation were acting in good faith.George Mousourakis, A Legal History of Rome (Routledge, 2007), p. 33. If correct law and procedures had been followed, it could be assumed that the outcome was iustum, right or valid. The losing side had thus in effect committed perjury, and forfeited his sacramentum as a form of piaculum, an expiatory sacrifice; the winner got his deposit back. The forfeited sacramentum was normally allotted by the state to the funding of sacra publica, public religious rites.Mousourakis, A Legal History of Rome, pp. 33, 206. Military oath The sacramentum militare (also as militum or militiae) was the oath taken by soldiers in pledging their loyalty to the consul in the Republican era or later to the emperor. The sacramentum as pertaining to both the law and the military indicates the religious basis for these institutions. The text of the oath was recorded by Vegetius:Vegetius 2.5. :Iurant autem milites omnia se strenue facturos quae praeceperit imperator, numquam deserturos militiam nec mortem recusaturos pro Romana republica! :(\\"But the soldiers swear that they shall faithfully execute all that the Emperor commands, that they shall never desert the service, and that they shall not seek to avoid death for the Roman republic!\\") The sacramentum that renders the soldier sacer helps explain why he was subjected to harsher penalties, such as execution and corporal punishment, that were considered inappropriate for civilian citizens, at least under the Republic.See further discussion at fustuarium In effect, he had put his life on deposit, a condition also of the fearsome sacramentum sworn by gladiators.Gladiators swore to commit their bodies to the possibility of being \\"burned, bound, beaten, and slain by the sword\\"; Petronius, Satyricon 117; Seneca, Epistulae 71.32. In the rare case of punishment by decimation, the surviving legionaries were often required to renew their oath, affirming the role of state religio as the foundation of Roman military discipline. By the 3rd century the sacramentum was administered annually, on January 3, as attested by the calendar of state ritual discovered at Dura-Europos, the so- called Feriale Duranum, which dates to the reign of Severus Alexander (222-235 AD).A.D. Nock, \\"The roman army and the Roman religious year\\", Harvard Theological Review 45 (1952:187-252). In the later empire, the oath of loyalty created conflict for Christians serving in the military, and produced a number of soldier-martyrs.Carlin A. Barton, The Sorrows of the Ancient Romans: The Gladiator and the Monster (Princeton University Press, 1993), pp. 14‚Äì16, 35 (note 88), 42, 45‚Äì47.

Ernst Wilhelm Nay (June 11, 1902 ‚Äì April 8, 1968) was a German painter and graphic designer of classical modernism. He is considered one of the most important painters of German post-war art. Biography Nay came from a Berlin civil servant's family. He was born the second son of six children. His father Johannes Nay fell in 1914 as a captain in Belgium. Nay completed his humanistic education with the Abitur at the provincial school Pforta in Thuringia in 1921. During this time he made his first painting attempts. He began a bookshop apprenticeship in the Berlin bookstore Gsellius, which he broke off after a year. After that, he supported himself with odd jobs and began to paint self-portraits and landscapes. With three of his autodidactically painted pictures, he presented himself in 1924 to Karl Hofer at the College of Fine Arts in Berlin. Hofer recognized Nay's talent, gave him a scholarship and included him in his painting class. At the college Nay met his future wife Helene (Elly) Kirchner who worked there as a model. He finished his studies in 1928. After a first study trip to Paris, the art historian Georg Carl Heise gave him in 1930 a scholarship for a stay on Bornholm, where he created the so-called \\"beach pictures\\". A year later, he received the Villa Massimo Fellowship in Rome from the Prussian Academy of Arts, where small-format, surrealist-abstract images were taken. In 1932, Nay married Elly Kirchner. The following year he participated in the exhibition \\"Living German Art\\" in the galleries Alfred Flechtheim and Paul Cassirer. In a critical article of the National Socialists in the \\"Volkischer Beobachter\\" of February 25, 1933, his picture \\"Liebespaar\\" was mocked in 1930 as a \\"masterpiece of vulgarity\\". During summer stays 1935‚Äì1936 at the Baltic Sea in Vietzkerstrand (Pomerania) emerged during a first major phase of the \\"Thin and Fischer pictures\\", 1934‚Äì1936, also large-scale pen and ink drawings, the so- called \\"fisherman's drawings\\". In 1937, two of his paintings were shown in the exhibition \\"Degenerate Art\\". Through Heise's mediation, Nay received financial support from Edvard Munch, which enabled him to travel to the Norwegian Lofoten Islands, where he painted large-format watercolors. The so-called \\"Lofoten-Bilder\\" (1937‚Äì1938) was created in the Berlin studio according to the motifs of these watercolors. In 1940, he forced himself (especially for financial reasons) to military service. First, he arrived as an infantryman to southern France, then to Brittany and in 1942 he was transferred as a card maker to Le Mans. There he met the amateur sculptor Pierre de T√©rouanne, who provided him his studio and even provided painting material. During these years, several smaller oil paintings and numerous works on paper were created. In 1944, Hans L√ºhdorf wrote a diary-like account of Nay's artistic work in Le Mans. Already in May 1945 Nay was released by the Americans. Because his Berlin apartment, which at the same time served as his studio, had been destroyed by a bomb attack in 1943, he moved to Hofheim / Ts. And was able to move into a small studio house through the intermediary of collector and art dealer Hanna Bekker vom Rath. After the war Nay created from 1945 to 1949 the so-called \\"Hekatebilder\\", which followed from 1949‚Äì1951 the \\"Fugal pictures\\". As early as 1946 he met Elisabeth Kerschbaumer, the assistant to his gallery owner G√ºnther Franke in Munich, and whom he married after a mutual divorce by Elly Nay in 1949. In 1950 a first retrospective of the artist took place in the Kestner-Gesellschaft in Hanover. A year later, he moved to Cologne, which remained his center of life until his death. In 1953 he drew an abstract film (\\"A melody, four painters\\", directed by Herbert Seggelke) together with Jean Cocteau, Gino Severini and Hans Erni. In the most well-known pictures of the artist, the so-called \\"Scheibenbildern\\" (1954-1962), the circular form of the disc became the dominant motif in all its modifications. The most prominent example of this is the 1956 mural \\"Freiburger Bild\\" (2.55 x 6.55 m) for the Chemical Institute of the Albert-Ludwigs-Universit√§t Freiburg. In 1955, Nay published his manifesto \\"From the Gestalt value of color\\". In this time his work found international resonance. His first solo exhibition in the USA was shown in 1955, followed one year later by a solo exhibition in the German pavilion at the Venice Biennale). He participated in documenta I (1955), II (1959) and III (1964). In 1960, the German art historian Werner Haftmann published the first Nay monograph. Between 1963-1964 Nay worked on the so- called \\"eye pictures\\". At the suggestion of Arnold Bode Nay painted in 1964 three large, 4 x 4 m measuring \\"documenta images\\", which were presented at the documenta III in Kassel on the ceiling (the \\"documenta images\\" are now on permanent loan to the Federal Chancellery in Berlin) , From 1965, the \\"late pictures\\" are created, to which Nay works until the end of his life. In 1968, Nay completed the designs for the \\"ceramic mural\\" in the Nuclear Research Center Karlsruhe, which, however, was only posthumously realized. At the beginning of April, the last painting \\"White-Black-Yellow\\" (WV 1303) was created. Shortly thereafter Nay died in his Cologne house of heart failure. He was buried at the Cologne Melaten cemetery.  Work  The following explanations are based on the introductory texts on the various phases of Elisabeth Nay-Scheibler's work in the catalogue raisonn√© of oil paintings. = Early Pictures (1922‚Äì1933) = The early pictures of Nay show autodidactically painted landscapes and portraits of his immediate surroundings, in which influences of Henri Matisse and his teacher Karl Hofer are recognizable. A special place takes the painting \\"portrait Franz Reuter\\" (WV 6) from 1925, \\"the image in which Nay was aware of being a painter.\\" His attachment to abstraction is already evident in the details of the paintings, and during his nine-month stay in Rome in 1931/32, Nay has hardly any eyes for the \\"classical\\" art of this city, but begins to work on oddly surreal, small- format still life with larvae, shells or worms to work (\\"Large shell with men\\", 1932, WV 110, \\"fleeing worms\\", 1932, WV 128). In his \\"Regests to life and work\\" he remembered this time: \\"[...] 1931/32 I was at the German Academy in Rome, annoying because I was crammed into school with the relics of humanistic education (... I painted surreal formal pictures, but certainly my own and throughout the course of my art quite einzubauende images.\\" = D√ºnen- and Fischer pictures (1934‚Äì1936) = With his mythical animal pictures, which originated around 1934 and the\\" dune and Fischer pictures \\"(\\" White Bull \\", 1934, WV 148,\\" Mandrill \\", 1934, WV 153), Nay developed a new way of image design. Animal shapes delineated by black lines are often accompanied by simple symbol shapes, such as the circle as sun and moon signs. Inspired by summer stays on the Baltic Sea, where he led a simple life with the fishermen, Nay recognized in the constant ups and downs of the swell an original form of dynamics (\\"dunes\\", 1935, WV 175). Even in prehistoric times, the wave or serpentine line with its alternating up and down bows as a sign of the eternal movement of death and rebirth. Nay transmitted this formal structure of the movement to dune and nocturnal sea pictures (\\"Nocturnal Sea\\", 1935, WV 182). In numerous large-format pen and ink drawings, which translate the entrances and exits of the boats and the activity of the fishermen into free line art, Nay prepared his so-called \\"dune and fisherman pictures\\", which also show a strong dynamic in the movement of the swells, but is also expressed in the contrasting verticals of the boat masts and sails (\\"Ostseefischer I\\", 1935, WV 189) .The figures of the fishermen are highly abstracted, their spherical or triangular heads showing only a single punctiform eye in the middle. = Lofoten-Bilder (1937‚Äì1938) and pictures from 1939 = With the beginning of National Socialist rule, Nay's life situation deteriorated considerably. His images were defamed as \\"degenerate\\" and he was banned from exhibiting, and he was no longer allowed to buy work materials (canvases, colors, etc.) The material worries of those years were compounded by the mental strain that resulted from the lack of contact. CG Heise helped this distressing situation by giving Nay two stays in Norwegian Lofoten, which had great significance for Nay's artistic development: \\"The bizarre formations of the mountains and fjords, the crystal clear light, the shadowless shining colors of the far north and the primeval The world of fishermen and whalers never failed to take effect on Nay, where he found himself confronting a nature that largely corresponded to his own, and with this experience, his complex of color broke completely [...]. \\" Compared to the previous works of the \\"Lofoten-Bilder\\" changed colourfulness Nay choose t expressive colors and uses z. For example, instead of clouds, strongly colored spots in the skies of the landscapes, which in combination with the other colors of the picture cancel out the spatial background effect of the sky (\\"Lofotenlandschaft\\", 1937, WV 218; \\"People in the Lofoten\\", 1938, WV 226). The almost always occurring people are dissolved into rhythmic-dynamic abstractions (\\"People in the Lofoten\\", 1938, WV 240). As abstracted figures, they become expressive color signatures, whereby landscape and figure appear as equal elements of chromatic image formation. = France Pictures (1940‚Äì1944) = Most of the works from the France period show thematically legendary scenes in which abstracted figures seem to be involved in a superpersonal, tragic or euphoric event. Even the titles, such as \\"Eduard's Death I-IV\\" (1943, WV 311-314) or \\"The Angel\\" (1944, WV 323), reflect the simultaneity of near-death and fullness of life. The peculiarly shaped head shapes and the eyes marked as closed by a stroke are reminiscent of skulls (\\"Liegende\\", 1943, WV 316). In contrast, the harmonious- warm color scheme of these images, in which Nay now for the first time selects yellow as the dominant color and often combined with bright red, thereby achieving a bright, vivid color sound. In order to bridge the seemingly perspicuous interstices of his intensively colored and dense pictorial compositions, he invented a motif of alternating repetitive checkerboard patterns, a design element that he would always use later. Nay wrote in his \\"Regesten\\": \\"Those images from the war were actually something unique in my art. They were born of personal experiences that I clung to because I could not understand everything else, a constellation that otherwise never existed in my art. \\" = Hecate Paintings (1945‚Äì1948) = From 1945, in Hofheim am Taunus, the numerous works of the so-called \\"Hecate Period\\" were created. These works mark a new stage of development in the field of tension between figurative motifs that are still recognizable and their almost entirely abstract design in Nay's work, which reflects both the tragedy of the recent past and the burgeoning hopes of those first years after the war, the term \\"Hecate imagery\\" coined Ernst Gosebruch (1872-1953) with reference to Nay's \\"Daughter of Hecate \\"I (1945, WV 337), of which Nay also made a second, smaller version (1946, WV 366).\\" Significantly, there is a daughter of the Hecate - a sorceress from the pre-Greek cults, moon goddess and goddess of death - in Greek Mythology is not This is an alienation or invention of Nay, as well as the titles in general from this work period, in which often ancient or bibl It is also striking that Nay's style of painting has changed at the same time: painting becomes impasto, and Nay now chooses one of many images much darker palette. In retrospect, Nay himself writes about these works: \\"Once again very strong formal ideas came to light that combined with mythical-magical ones. Paintings, painted thick, the year after year, the older they get - all the better. Where I meet them, I am delighted. But I am a person of the present whom the present also determines in his life. \\" = Rhythmic Pictures (1952‚Äì1953) = At the end of 1951, Nay moved to Cologne, still marked by war damage, and moved into a loft in Wiethasestra√üe in Cologne-Braunsfeld. Nay reacts to this change from a rural domicile to the urban, lively departure situation of the Rhenish metropolis with a new, completely non-objective image design. Even under the influence of musical excitement (Cologne was then already known for its important concerts of New Music), images now emerge in which the clear contours of the fugals dissolve images in a violently moving rhythm, resulting in finer, more spontaneous and gestural color forms expresses the mostly black line structures are accompanied. The musicality of these images is reflected in their titles: \\"Vocal sound\\" (1952, WV 604), \\"Silver melody\\" (1952, WV 600) or \\"Black rhythms, red to gray\\" (1952, WV 629). Looking back on this period, Nay wrote in 1962: \\"I was particularly interested in the absolute tone and the often extended negative forms of Webern's music. That was around 1950. Later, the compositions of serial and punctual music were added. Next to Dallapiccola and Nono, Boulez impresses me the most. This one because of his extensive work in electronic music, whose technique I met here in Cologne.\\" = Scheibenbilder (1954‚Äì1962) = In his most well-known, longest and most successful period to date, Nay makes the round shape of the disc ‚Äì in all its variations ‚Äì the main motif of his painting, which he now increasingly reflects theoretically. In 1955 he publishes his book \\"On the Design Value of Color\\", in which he outlines the fundamentals of his \\"first system\\" of color \\"punctuation.\\" As Nay discovered the \\"disc\\" as a central design element, he himself describes it this way: \\"That's how it started I started with very innocuous new experiments and found out: If I go with a brush on the canvas, there is a small blob, I enlarge that, then I have a disc.This disc is of course already doing a lot on the surface If I add other slices, then a system of at least colored and quantitative proportions is created, which can now be combined and further assembled into larger image complexes. \\" After Nay had combined the slices initially with graphic elements, they became the sole in 1955 Picture motive and from today's point of view \\"classical\\" works of this period emerge.From 1957/58 Nay changes the outer Ers His discourses are shaped more openly and softer in their outlines (\\"Rondo\\", 1958, WV 871), then developed more out of the circular movement of the brush (\\"Chorisch Grau\\", 1960, WV 971) and finally with Partially violent gestures \\"to strike through\\" begins (\\"Ecstatic Blue\\", WV 990, 1961). Behind this was the fact that Nay felt that he had to \\"open\\" or \\"overcome\\" his hitherto stringently enforced system of selective placement of color at some point, so as not to get stuck in a \\"modern academy of painting\\". = Augenbilder (1963‚Äì1964) = The spontaneous crossing of the discs leads Nay around 1962/63 to the discovery of the ocular motif, which as a further development of the \\"disc\\" for two years, the image of the so-called \\"eye images\\" determines (\\"eyes\\", 1964, WV 1092 In the light of the artist's intention to \\"open\\", it is characteristic that with this motif of the \\"eye\\", for the first time in years, something reminiscent of the human being is visible again (Magda, p. 26). This primeval theme of seeing and being looked at together, promising magical powers and spellbinding defenses in archetypal symbols, but also symbolizing light and spiritual awareness, is a daunting challenge to Nay's completely non-objective image design. But he does not renounce the association of the magical aura of this figurative form, but brings the effect of the large-scale eye-forms of his images into balance with a very moving, abstract formal language, which he incorporates into a passionately unfolding chromaticism. All registers of a strongly contrasting colourfulness, as well as the emphasis on delicate-light and dark-colored contrasts, brings Nay into this dialogue and thus increases the vitality and freedom of his image design. But despite the newly won and spiritedly used painterly freedom, the details and the overall conception of these paintings have a controlled order. In public, the new and so unusually expressive images Nay were perceived ambivalent. The three \\"documenta images\\" of 1964 (WV 1121, 1122 and WV 1123) were discussed in the so-called \\"documenta dispute\\" extremely controversial and led to some violent polemics against Nay. = Late Pictures (1965‚Äì1968) = From 1965, Nay made one final turn in his work: he abandoned the \\"monostructure\\" of the \\"disc shape\\" as a dominating design element and developed his \\"second system\\" of colored \\"sequence\\", for which not only one changed style of painting (the paint becomes fluid and even), but above all a re-expanded and formally very clear repertoire of forms is characteristic. For example, precisely defined spindle shapes (\\"Spindle - Red\\", 1967, WV 1260), chains of round or oval discs (\\"Red Chain\\", 1965, WV 1180) and bow shapes (\\"With dark gray arch form\\", 1966, WV 1208) and Ribbons, often associated with organic remembering associations. In the last pictures even \\"figurative\\", partly even reminiscent of the form of human formations emerge, with which in these pictures, according to Nay, a beyond the traditional opposition \\"abstract against real\\", lying, \\"hitherto unknown human representation\\" or a \\"new visual picture of man\\" beyond the opposition \\"abstract\\" or \\"real\\", Nay finds with these works to a new, almost third and by himself as \\"elementary\\" designated image form, in which the always central theme of his art ‚Äì the human being ‚Äì returns to the picture in a completely new way.In 1967, in his last essay \\"My Color\\", which he himself published, he writes: \\"It is worth living so far that the real color image can arise and the color sounds in such a way that without special intention of the artist human becomes visible, human and creaturely in new, unknown he formulation. \\" The written estate is since 1979 in the Archive of Fine Arts in the Germanic National Museum. In September 2005, the Ernst Wilhelm Nay Foundation, which manages and manages the artistic estate of Nay, was founded in Cologne.  Exhibitions (selected)  1946: E. W.

The screenplay by David Nicholls is based on the 1993 memoir of the same title by Blake Morrison. Plot While Blake Morrison, his mother, and younger sister Gillian tend to his father, Arthur, on his deathbed in his Yorkshire home, Blake has a series of flashbacks of moments he shared with his father. Despite Blake's success as a writer, poet, and critic, his father ‚Äì a rural general practitioner ‚Äì never accepted his decision to pursue a literary career or acknowledged his achievements. Bullying, blustery, and boorish, Arthur blunders his way through fatherhood, regularly calling his son a fathead and intruding into the boy's private moments with a sense of entitlement. He has a penchant for exaggeration when he is not telling outright lies, and publicly humiliates his long-suffering wife Kim with his shameless flirting with various women and an affair with Beaty, a friend of the family. At other times, he seems genuinely interested in bonding with his son, taking him camping so they can test supposedly waterproof sleeping bags he has made or allowing him to practise driving in the family's Alvis convertible on a wide expanse of deserted beach with reckless abandon. As a result, Blake is left with mixed feelings for his father, ranging from deeply rooted anger to compassionate acceptance. Only after Arthur's death is he able to set aside his resentment and recognise him as someone whose flaws ultimately helped mould his son into the better man he is. Cast Production The film was shot on location in Brighton in East Sussex; Chichester, Goodwood, Petworth, and West Wittering in West Sussex; Bakewell, Cromford, Kedleston, and Snake Pass in Derbyshire; the National Liberal Club in Westminster, London; Sheffield in South Yorkshire; Flintham in Nottinghamshire; and Yorkshire Dales in North Yorkshire. Interiors were filmed at the Twickenham Film Studios in Middlesex. The film premiered at the Galway Film Festival in July 2007 and was shown at the Edinburgh Film Festival, the Telluride Film Festival, the Toronto International Film Festival, the Edmonton International Film Festival, and the Dinard Festival of British Cinema before going into theatrical release in the UK, Ireland, and Malta on 5 October 2007. It then was shown at the Rome Film Festival, the Cairo International Film Festival, the Dubai International Film Festival, the Miami International Film Festival, and the Ashland Independent Film Festival before going into limited release in the US on 6 June 2008. Critical reception The film received generally favourable reviews. Rotten Tomatoes reported 72% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 101 reviews, while Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 61 out of 100, based on 25 reviews. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian rated the film four out of five stars, calling it \\"an intelligent and heartfelt film\\" and one that \\"deserves to be seen.\\" Philip French of The Observer said the film \\"touches movingly, enlighteningly on universal matters we can all identify with, and it does so without ever getting maudlin or sentimental.\\" Damon Smith of the Manchester Evening News called the film \\"a bittersweet and, at times, moving account of the strained family ties which define each and every one of us.\\" Manohla Dargis of The New York Times called the film \\"A gentle tale gently told\\" and \\"grown-up, civilized fare\\" and added, \\"If that sounds like a compliment, it is, even though the whole thing might have been improved with a bit of messiness, a little vulgarity to leaven its tastefulness and tact. This isn't a groundbreaking work; just a smartly played story, enlivened by drama and spiked with passion, the very thing that thinking audiences pine for, especially during the summer spectacle season when theaters are clogged with sticky kids' stuff and television reruns.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun- Times observed, \\"It's a sad movie, with a mournful score, romantic landscape photography and heartbreaking deathbed scenes . . . But it's not very satisfying . . . The film did not provide me with fulfillment or a catharsis . . . This is a film of regret, and judging by what we see of the characters, it deserves to be.\\" Walter Addiego of the San Francisco Chronicle said, \\"This classy tearjerker is worth seeing more for its virtuoso acting than for its bare-bones tale of how a sensitive man copes with the death of his domineering father. The film is cleanly and intelligently made, and, excepting a few moments toward the end, it's moving without being mawkish. While you might leave the theater feeling the picture finally doesn't quite have the dramatic heft it should, it offers plenty of compensations along the way.\\" Derek Elley of Variety called the film \\"immaculately acted, professionally helmed and saturated in period British atmosphere,\\" \\"an unashamed tearjerker that's all wrapping and no center,\\" and \\"undeniably effective at a gut level despite its dramatic shortcomings.\\" He added, \\"[B]y never getting to the heart of the matter, nor having even one scene where father and son really talk, the movie has a big black hole at its core. In the smorgasbord of father-son relationship pics, this one is very low-cal.\\" Awards and nominations The film was nominated for seven British Independent Film Awards, including Best British Independent Film, Best Actor (Jim Broadbent), Best Supporting Actor (Colin Firth), Most Promising Newcomer (Matthew Beard), Best Director, and Best Screenplay. Jim Broadbent was nominated for the London Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor but lost to Daniel Day-Lewis in There Will Be Blood. Elaine Cassidy was nominated for the Irish Film & Television Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Film Role but lost to Saoirse Ronan in Atonement. DVD release The Region 1 DVD was released on 4 November 2008. The film is in anamorphic widescreen format with an audio track in English and subtitles in French and Spanish.

History  Preparations of the original Baltic LNG project started in 2004. On 15 October 2004, Baltic LNG AG was registered in Baar, Switzerland (later in Z√ºrich) as a joint venture of Gazprom and Sovkomflot. In 2005, Gazprom started to negotiate with Petro-Canada to construct the LNG plant and to conclude a supply agreement for LNG shipments to Canadian market. On 14 March 2006, Gazprom and Petro-Canada signed an agreement to proceed with initial engineering design of the Baltic LNG plant. It was agreed to ship LNG from the Baltic LNG plant to Petro-Canada's LNG regasification facility in Gros- Cacouna, Quebec. In 2006, Gazprom started to look for other markets and partners inviting 17 energy companies from Europe, Asia and North America for negotiations. On 21 September 2007, Gazprom decided to continue work on the feasibility study, leaving it unclear when it would make a final decision whether to build the plant. On 7 February 2008, Gazprom terminated the project because it considered the Baltic LNG plant less competitive than other projects in the region ‚Äî the Nord Stream pipeline and the possible LNG facility of the Shtokman field. The project was renewed in 2013. In January 2015 it was announced that the new location of the project would be near the Ust-Luga Port. Original project The original plant was to be built in Primorsk, Leningrad Oblast. The project foresaw a capacity of 5‚Äì7.2 million tonnes of LNG per year, depending on whether one or two LNG trains would be built. The LNG plant was expected to cost US$3.7 billion and it was to become operational by 2012. The technical design of the project was done by Giprospetsgaz, a subsidiary of Gazprom, and KBR, a subsidiary of Halliburton. The LNG plant was to be supplied from the Russian unified natural gas grid, including from the onshore section of Nord Stream pipeline, and from the Shtokman field. The project was developed by Baltic LNG AG, a joint venture between Russian companies Gazprom (80% of shares) and Sovkomflot (20%). The head of the company was Alexander Krasnenkov. The plan was to involve foreign partner or partners into the project in terms that Gazprom could remain 51% of shares. In 2006, Gazprom invited 17 companies to participate, of which 15 showed interest. In April 2007, Gazprom shorted list to four companies. They were Petro-Canada, BP, Eni and Mitsubishi. In September 2007, media reported that also Spain's Iberdrola was talking with Gazprom about its participation in the project. Current project According to the renewed plan the plant would be built near the Ust-Luga Port. It would have two trains with total capacity of 10 million tonnes of LNG per year, with option to add later an addition train to increase the capacity up to 15 million tonnes. The plant is expected to cost about US$18.5 billion. Potential partners of the project may include Royal Dutch Shell, Mitsui, and Mitsubishi.  Risks  Gazprom has identified a number of risks related to the project. According to Igor Meshcherin, head of Gazprom's project evaluation directorate, environmental risks are the congested Gulf of Finland and Danish Straits, and ice conditions. Another risk was that there is not capacity in the unified natural gas system in the Leningrad Oblast, and the project might require expansion of the pipeline grid.

The impetus to establish the society came from the aristocratic landowners of Piedmont who provided its leadership. During this period they were anxious to embrace the results of scientific research into new and more productive farming methods in order to maximise the profitability of their estates. This they achieved through such means as developing the network of irrigation canals, extending the cultivation of rice, introducing new animal breeds, and establishing new business arrangements: sharecropping was replaced by large-scale leasing agreements.Anthony L.

Miron Winslow Miron Winslow (11 December 1789 ‚Äì 22 October 1864) was an American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions missionary to the American Ceylon Mission, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), where he established a mission at Oodooville and founded a seminary. He founded a mission station at Madras, the first and chief station of the American Madras Mission. He published several books, notably, A History of Missions and A Comprehensive Tamil and English Dictionary of High and Low Tamil, a Tamil to English lexicon which took twenty years of missionary labor to compile sixty-seven thousand Tamil words. This dictionary was based in part on manuscript material of the pastor Joseph Knight, of the London Missionary Society, and the Rev. Samuel Hutchings, of the American mission, and was the most complete dictionary of a modern Indian language published at that time. The book later become the basis for the more exhaustive Tamil Lexicon dictionary published by the University of Madras in 1924. Biography =Early life= He was born in Williston, Vermont, on December 11, 1789 to Anna Kellogg and Nathaniel Winslow. At the age of fourteen, he started his career as a store clerk and then established himself in a business in Norwich, Connecticut, where he was employed for two years. With conversion, he had a conviction that he had to preach gospel, and to preach un-evangelized nations; therefore, changed career paths, and gave himself to the service of Christ among the . Later, he graduated from Middlebury College in 1815 and Andover Theological Seminary in 1818. On January 19, 1819, he married Harriet W. Lathrop, who bore him six children. During his vacation years at Andover Theological Seminary, he worked as an agent of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM) to tour New England and raise funds. On November 4, 1818, he was ordained by ABCFM at Tabernacle Church, Salem, Massachusetts, together with Pliny Fisk and others. He was sent as a missionary to Ceylon Mission, Ceylon. =Missionary work= On June 8, 1819, he embarked from Boston on the brig Indus, bound for Calcutta, India. From Calcutta, he proceeded to Ceylon and reached his destination on December 14, 1819. As part of his missionary duty, he was initially stationed at Oodooville on July 4, 1820. At Oodooville, he established a mission and a seminary. After having laboured for fourteen years at Oodooville, he was transferred to Madras, South India. Having arrived at Madras on August 18, 1836, he had chosen that as the mission site for the American Madras Mission and started his missionary activities; consequently, Winslow is credited in commencing [founding] the American Madras Mission in 1836. In September 1836, he was joined by John Scudder, Sr., the first American medical missionary in India. In 1839 they were joined by the young missionary printer Phineas R. Hunt who sailed from America to take charge of the mission press. Winslow visited America in 1855, but returned in 1858. Due to ill-health, he left again to America in August 1864; however, he died at the age of seventy-four, on his way from India to America at the Cape of Good Hope (Cape Town), South Africa, on 22 October 1864, two days after he reached Cape Town. Bibliography During his senior years in the seminary at Andover, he wrote A History of Missions or History of the principal attempt to propagate Christianity among the Heathen, and it was published by Flagg and Gould at Andover in 1819. During his passage from India to America in 1855, he wrote Hints on Missions that had been published by M.W. Dodd in 1856. It is a sort of digest of his experiences and observations during his thirty-seven years of missionary life. In addition to these, he published several of his sermons and addresses as pamphlets. Most of his missionary labors were consumed in translating the Bible into the Tamil language in 1855, especially in the preparation of a Tamil-English lexicon entitled A Comprehensive Tamil and English Dictionary of High and Low Tamil, completed in 1862. Winslow devoted almost three to four hours a day for nearly thirty years to this project. It extends to nearly a thousand quarto pages, and contains more than sixty-seven thousand Tamil words. This dictionary has thirty thousand five hundred and fifty one (31,551) more words than any other dictionary of the Tamil language. The dictionary was so comprehensive, that it included the astronomical, mythological, astrological, scientific, botanical, and official terms, along with names of gods, authors, and heroes‚Äîfor this, he received the highest encomiums from the Indian and English press like the Madras Observer; the Madras Times; the Colombo Observer-Statesman; the New York Observer; and more, and also from literary and official press too.

It quantifies the severity of multicollinearity in an ordinary least squares regression analysis. It provides an index that measures how much the variance (the square of the estimate's standard deviation) of an estimated regression coefficient is increased because of collinearity. Cuthbert Daniel claims to have invented the concept behind the variance inflation factor, but did not come up with the name. Definition Consider the following linear model with k independent variables: : Y = Œ≤0 \\\\+ Œ≤1 X1 \\\\+ Œ≤2 X 2 \\\\+ ... + Œ≤k Xk \\\\+ Œµ. The standard error of the estimate of Œ≤j is the square root of the j + 1 diagonal element of s2(X‚Ä≤X)‚àí1, where s is the root mean squared error (RMSE) (note that RMSE2 is a consistent estimator of the true variance of the error term, \\\\sigma^2 ); X is the regression design matrix -- a matrix such that Xi, j+1 is the value of the jth independent variable for the ith case or observation, and such that Xi,1, the predictor vector associated with the intercept term, equals 1 for all i. It turns out that the square of this standard error, the estimated variance of the estimate of Œ≤j, can be equivalently expressed as: : \\\\widehat{\\\\operatorname{var}}(\\\\hat{\\\\beta}_j) = \\\\frac{s^2}{(n-1)\\\\widehat{\\\\operatorname{var}}(X_j)}\\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{1-R_j^2}, where Rj2 is the multiple R2 for the regression of Xj on the other covariates (a regression that does not involve the response variable Y). This identity separates the influences of several distinct factors on the variance of the coefficient estimate: * s2: greater scatter in the data around the regression surface leads to proportionately more variance in the coefficient estimates * n: greater sample size results in proportionately less variance in the coefficient estimates * \\\\widehat\\\\operatorname{var}(X_j): greater variability in a particular covariate leads to proportionately less variance in the corresponding coefficient estimate The remaining term, 1 / (1 ‚àí Rj2) is the VIF. It reflects all other factors that influence the uncertainty in the coefficient estimates. The VIF equals 1 when the vector Xj is orthogonal to each column of the design matrix for the regression of Xj on the other covariates. By contrast, the VIF is greater than 1 when the vector Xj is not orthogonal to all columns of the design matrix for the regression of Xj on the other covariates. Finally, note that the VIF is invariant to the scaling of the variables (that is, we could scale each variable Xj by a constant cj without changing the VIF). : \\\\widehat{\\\\operatorname{var}}(\\\\hat{\\\\beta}_j) = s^2 [(X^T X)^{-1}]_{jj} Now let r= X^T X, and without losing generality, we reorder the columns of X to set the first column to be X_j : r^{-1} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} r_{j,j} & r_{j,-j} \\\\\\\\\\\\ r_{-j,j} & r_{-j,-j}\\\\end{bmatrix}^{-1} : r_{j,j} = X_j^T X_j, r_{j,-j} = X_j^T X_{-j}, r_{-j,j} = X_{-j}^T X_j, r_{-j,-j} = X_{-j}^T X_{-j}. By using Schur complement, the element in the first row and first column in r^{-1} is, :r^{-1}_{1,1} = [r_{j,j} - r_{j,-j} r_{-j,-j}^{-1} r_{-j,j} ]^{-1} Then we have, : \\\\begin{align} & \\\\widehat{\\\\operatorname{var}}(\\\\hat{\\\\beta}_j) = s^2 [(X^T X)^{-1}]_{jj} = s^2 r^{-1}_{1,1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ = {} & s^2 [X_j^T X_j - X_j^T X_{-j} (X_{-j}^T X_{-j})^{-1} X_{-j}^T X_j ]^{-1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ = {} & s^2 [X_j^T X_j - X_j^T X_{-j} (X_{-j}^T X_{-j})^{-1} (X_{-j}^T X_{-j}) (X_{-j}^T X_{-j})^{-1} X_{-j}^T X_j ]^{-1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ = {} & s^2 [X_j^T X_j - \\\\hat{\\\\beta}_{*j}^T(X_{-j}^T X_{-j}) \\\\hat{\\\\beta}_{*j} ]^{-1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ = {} & s^2 \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathrm{RSS}_j} \\\\\\\\\\\\ = {} & \\\\frac{s^2}{(n-1)\\\\widehat\\\\operatorname{var}(X_j)}\\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{1-R_j^2} \\\\end{align} Here \\\\hat{\\\\beta}_{*j} is the coefficient of regression of dependent variable X_j over covariate X_{-j} . \\\\mathrm{RSS}_j is the corresponding residual sum of squares. Calculation and analysis We can calculate k different VIFs (one for each Xi) in three steps: = Step one = First we run an ordinary least square regression that has Xi as a function of all the other explanatory variables in the first equation. If i = 1, for example, equation would be :X_1=\\\\alpha_0 + \\\\alpha_2 X_2 + \\\\alpha_3 X_3 + \\\\cdots + \\\\alpha_k X_k +e where \\\\alpha_0 is a constant and e is the error term. = Step two = Then, calculate the VIF factor for \\\\hat\\\\beta_i with the following formula : : \\\\mathrm{VIF}_i = \\\\frac{1}{1-R^2_i} where R2i is the coefficient of determination of the regression equation in step one, with X_i on the left hand side, and all other predictor variables (all the other X variables) on the right hand side. = Step three = Analyze the magnitude of multicollinearity by considering the size of the \\\\operatorname{VIF}(\\\\hat \\\\beta_i). A rule of thumb is that if \\\\operatorname{VIF}(\\\\hat \\\\beta_i) > 10 then multicollinearity is high (a cutoff of 5 is also commonly used). Some software instead calculates the tolerance which is just the reciprocal of the VIF. The choice of which to use is a matter of personal preference. .  Interpretation  The square root of the variance inflation factor indicates how much larger the standard error increases compared to if that variable had 0 correlation to other predictor variables in the model. Example If the variance inflation factor of a predictor variable were 5.27 (‚àö5.27 = 2.3), this means that the standard error for the coefficient of that predictor variable is 2.3 times larger than if that predictor variable had 0 correlation with the other predictor variables.

Underneath it, a makeshift bamboo bridge was built, which is removed for passing ships upon payment of a fee. The Canal des Pangalanes is a canal that consists of a series of natural rivers, waterways and man-made lakes that extends for over and runs down the east coast of Madagascar from Mahavelona to Farafangana. It is used primarily for transportation and fishing, and it has unspoiled natural beaches that are visited by tourists. An initial area of the canal in Toamasina (unofficially and in French referred to as Tamatave) is straight, while subsequent areas have curves, lagoons, connected lakes and swamps.Madagascar: Trade and services - Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Construction efforts began during the era of the Merina monarchy, with major expansion during the French colonial period between 1896 and 1904, and additional expansion during 1949‚Äì1957. Construction has included the manual cutting and removal of outcrops to connect previously unconnected areas. Construction Initial expansion and maintenance of Canal des Pangalanes during the time of the Merina monarchy (c. 1540‚Äì1897), involved cutting through outcrops to connect areas. Significant expansions of the canal were undertaken by France with the support of Joseph Gallieni during the French colonial period between 1896 and 1904 to increase trade, provide a means to supply troops that were located inland, and to provide a safe route for cargo boats destined for Toamasina compared to traveling along the coast of the Indian Ocean. By 1901, an uninterrupted canal existed between Toamasina and Andevoranto, which extended . Additional construction from 1949 to 1957, cost over 800 million CFA francs to complete. Part of this project included the 570 million CFA franc construction of a river port at Toamasina and improvements to the canal for from Toamasina to south of Ivondro, which was completed in 1953. Further work after World War II enabled 30-ton barges to travel between Tamatave and Vatomandry, a distance of . A study in the 1950s regarding extending the canal for an additional from Ivondro to Manakara found that the cost would have been at least 1,400 million CFA francs. This proposal was shelved, due to concerns about the high construction costs when the trade between the two areas was low relative to these costs. Population growth not attaining expected numbers in the areas during this time was a factor in the rejection of this extension. Additional objections to this expansion came from businesspeople in Toamasina and Manakara, who voiced concerns about the potential to lose trade at the port of Toamasina. Large navigation companies opposed this extension, to protect the high fees they imposed for cargo loading and unloading at auxiliary ports on the east coast. Use Canal des Pangalanes is used by local people: Some of them use canoes for travel and make their homes along its banks. Ferries run up and down navigable areas transporting items such as wood, charcoal, dried fish and other produce. Many local people rely upon the canal for and, for some of them, it is their only means of travel. The canal provides fish for the locals, and cassava is grown along its banks. Coffee factories exist along the canal. Some areas have white, sandy beaches.

By 2011 the tug barges were observed to be no longer in use and the warehouses were empty. The tug barges are stored near the pier in Toamasina, where they are rotting.

Through his works, assimilating and embodying the intellectual approach of the best Italian universities of the time, yet setting it inside the intellectual culture of Jewish tradition, he is seen as a quintessential example of a hakham kolel (\\"comprehensive scholar\\"), a scholar who excelled in both secular and rabbinic studies, the Hebrew equivalent of a Renaissance man. This was the ideal he tried to instil in his students. One of his students was Yohanan Alemanno. Life Judah is thought to have been born in around 1420 at Montecchio Maggiore, now in the Italian province of Vicenza. The son of a doctor, he was ordained as a rabbi and received a diploma in medicine while in his early 20s. According to tradition the honorific title Messer (a title of knighthood) was bestowed on him by the Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor, during the emperor's first visit to Italy in 1452, perhaps for work for him as a physician. The name \\"Leon\\" is the usual equivalent of \\"Judah\\", through the traditional identification of the lion of Judah. Messer Leon settled as a rabbi at Ancona at about this time, and established a yeshiva, or academy, where he combined the traditional study of the Jewish texts with lectures on the non-Jewish program of the medieval secular curriculum. This academy was to follow him wherever he stayed around Italy over the next four decades. He was also licensed to practice medicine, and his successful activities in this field brought him much acclaim. Between 1456 and 1472 he lived in Padua and Bologna, where he may have studied further at the famous Universities. He is said to have been awarded the title Doctor in Padua in 1469. After a short stay in Venice, where his son David was born, in 1473 he became rabbi in Mantua. There he fell into a conflict with his colleague Joseph Colon Trabotto, in consequence of which both were expelled from the city in 1475. In 1480 he settled in Naples, then under the accommodating rule of Ferdinand I. He remained there, with his academy, for virtually the whole of the rest of his life, until he and his son David were forced to flee in 1495, the year after the death of King Ferdinand, to escape the violent pogroms that ensued following the capture of the city by the French under Charles VIII. An ordination document issued by David in September 1499 refers to his father as by then already dead. Rabinowitz conjectures that Messer Leon had been with David, and died at Monastir (present-day Bitola in the Republic of Macedonia) in that year. However, Tirosh-Rothschild (p. 253, n. 104) believes he was still in Naples, and died there in 1497. Works Messer Leon wrote extensively, including commentaries on the Organon, the Nicomachean Ethics, and the Physics of Aristotle, and their analysis by Averroes, in which he followed the Scholastic style and methods, composing for his students \\"summaries (sefeqot) on the Scholastic quaestiones (i.e. points of apparent textual contradiction) debated by the Italian academic community\\",Zonta p. 210, quoting Tirosh-Rothschild drawing closely on the style and substance of expositions then current at Padua. These commentaries were written primarily for his close followers. More generally circulated were three textbooks addressing the three foundation subjects of a Renaissance secular education, the trivium (\\"three ways\\") of grammar, logic and rhetoric, seen as the essential prerequisite disciplines necessary for higher studies in the humanities, philosophy, and medicine. These subjects he covered with a Hebrew grammar under the title Libnat ha-Sappir (The Pavement of Sapphire) in 1454, a textbook on logic entitled Miklal Yofi (Perfection of Beauty) in 1455, and, most celebrated, a textbook of rhetoric called Nofet Zufim (The Honeycomb's Flow), which was printed by Abraham Conat of Mantua in 1475-6, the only work by a living author printed in Hebrew in the fifteenth century. Like non-Jewish contemporary texts, the Nofet Zufim drew heavily on the classical theoretical writings of Cicero and Quintilian. But unlike its contemporaries, it took as its exemplars for such theories not the foremost orators of Greek and Roman antiquity, but Moses and the leading figures of the Hebrew Bible. In the opinion of Deutsch,Jewish Encyclopedia the object of the work was both apologetic and propagandic. The author desired to demonstrate to the non- Jewish world that the Jews were not devoid of the literary sense, and he wished to prove to his co-religionists that Judaism is not hostile to secular studies, which contribute to a better appreciation of Jewish literature. Although in later centuries the book was largely forgotten, and was not reprinted until the nineteenth century, in the intellectual circle of its own time it was highly appreciated. Azariah dei Rossi quoted Leon as a witness to the value of secular studies,ch. ii., in Me'or 'Enayim, ed. Benjacob, i. 75, Wilna, 1863 and Joseph Solomon Delmedigo recommended the book to the Karaite Zera·∏• bar Natan of Trakai.Geiger, Melo Chofnajim, p. 19, Berlin, 1840. In recent times interest has been renewed, with a new scholarly edition with translation and commentary published in 1983. Descendants Following on from his father, Messer Leon's son also became a noted rabbi, physician and author, and defender of the value of the secular disciplines of the Renaissance to Jewish philosophy culture and study. David became best known for his Ein ha-Kore (Eye of the Reader), a sympathetic commentary on Maimonides' The Guide for the Perplexed; and posthumously for his Tehillah le- Dawid (Glory to David), an encyclopedic summary of Jewish philosophy, edited by his grandson Aaron ben Judah (Constantinople, 1577).

He was educated at Wellington Commercial and Grammar School, and was later educated in England at the Catholic College of St. Mary in Derbyshire, and at Kensington Grammar School in London. He returned to NZ in 1864 and entered Johnston & Co who were ship owners and merchants. His family was descended from the Johnstons of Annandale, through the Ayrshire Branch of the family. He joined the volunteers and when the Wellington Brigade was formed was appointed to the rank of Captain. When he moved to the active-reserve he was appointed Captain-Commandant. Two of his eight sons were killed in action in World War I, Brigadier-General Francis Earl Johnston and Captain Octavius Featherston Johnston. Another four of his sons also served in World War I - Guy, Charles, Harold, and Ian Johnston. Johnston also had three daughters - Zo√´, Alice, and Doris. Zo√´ was also widowed on the death of her husband William Fitzgerald Levin from injuries suffered at Gallipoli. He represented the Te Aro electorate from 1881 to 1887, when he resigned. He was a member of the Legislative Council from 1891 until his death in 1918, and the Speaker from 1915 to 1918. He was appointed from 22 January 1891 as one of seven new members (including Harry Atkinson himself) appointed to the Council by the outgoing fourth Atkinson Ministry; a move regarded by Liberals as a stacking of the upper house against the new government. He married Alice Margaret Featherston, daughter of Isaac Featherston, at Wellington on 12 January 1871. He died in Wellington on 13 June 1918 after a prolonged illness. Posthumously knighted. A brother Walter Woods Johnston was also an MP. His fourth son, Harold Featherston Johnston (1875‚Äì1959), became a judge of the Supreme Court and was appointed King's Counsel in 1930. Upon the death of Charles Skerrett in 1929, the position of Chief Justice was offered to Harold Johnston, who declined the offer, and Michael Myers became the next Chief Justice instead.

His Guantanamo Internment Serial Number was 190. Joint Task Force Guantanamo analysts report he was born on December 14, 1976, in Shibin El Kom, Egypt. Life prior to his capture According to Andy Worthington, the author of The Guantanamo Files, Mashad was a businessman, who had made his home in Italy, who had travelled to Afghanistan solely to provide humanitarian aid. He had been a talented athlete and craftsman. He worked at Beach resorts in Sinai for three years, after graduating from technical school, then went to live in Italy with an uncle who was an Italian citizen. After working in construction in Italy he started his own successful construction firm Afghanistan and capture and interrogation Worthington describes Mashad agreeing to travel to Afghanistan to work with a Kuwaiti businessman and philanthropist. According to Worthington Mushad would later describe this decision as a combination charitable exercise and business networking opportunity -- \\"like attending a fundraising gala\\". Mashad arrived in Afghanistan, in mid-2001, in spite of his mother's reservations, according to Worthington. He was trapped in Afghanistan after the Afghan-Iranian border closed following the US counter-attacks. He was able to cross the border with Pakistan, in November 2001, but was promptly apprehended by a Pakistani border patrol. Worthington attributed his continued detention by US forces to \\"patently false\\" denunciations from other captives. He offered the example of a denunciation from one of the Guantanamo captives who passed right from being a Taliban prison to US custody. This captive claimed Mashad had been one of his torturers, in 2000. Worthington repeated how Mashad had insisted to his interrogators that he was living in Italy in 2000 as his documents clearly established. Another allegation that Mashad thought he could refute was that he had been aiding Arabs in Bosnia, in 1991, when that country was breaking away from Yugoslavia. At that time Mashad pointed out he was a fourteen-year- old schoolboy in Egypt. Sharif Fathim Al Mushad v. George Walker Bush A writ of habeas corpus was submitted on Sharif Fathim Al Mushad's behalf. In response, on 16 August 2005 the Department of Defense released 17 pages of unclassified documents related to his Combatant Status Review Tribunal. On December 15, 2004 Tribunal panel 25 confirmed that he was an \\"enemy combatant\\". According to Worthington even though his habeas petition had been filed in 2005 he didn't meet with Cori Crider, of Reprieve until 2008. OARDEC status reviews In its 2004 ruling in Rasul v. Bush the United States Supreme Court order the Department of Defense to conduct hearings where the captives could learn why they were being held, and where they could try to refute those allegations. Records from the 2004, 2005, 2005 and 2007 hearings were published due to Freedom of Information Act requests. Recommendation for Continued Detention Under DoD Control In April 2010 the whistleblower organization WikiLeaks published a Recommendation for Continued Detention Under DoD Control, dated September 15, 2008. This eight page formerly secret document was signed by camp commandant David M Thomas, and recommended continued detention. Transfer from Guantanamo Sharif Fati Ali al Mishad was transferred to Albania in February 2010 after he spent almost eight years in the Guantanamo camps. In March 2012 Albania refused to let Mashad return to his home Egypt. Following the overthrow of the Hosni Mubarak regime former Egyptian captives who feared reprisal and who were thus sent to third countries, have been assured it is now safe for them to return to Egypt. Albanian officials have not explained why they will not allow him to leave. His Albanian born wife is also prevented from leaving the country, even though she has a valid visa for Egypt.

Performance refers to the accuracy of a control system's ability to track (output) the desired signals to regulate the plant process variables in the most beneficial and optimised way, without delay or overshoot. Importance Regulatory control loops are critical in automated manufacturing and utility industries like refining, paper and chemicals manufacturing, power generation, among others. They are used to control a particular parameter within a process. The parameter that is being controlled could be temperature, pressure, flow or level of some process. For example, temperature controllers are used in boilers which are used in production of gasoline. Software There are many software applications that help in measuring and analysing the performance of control loops in industrial plants. Benchmarking the loop performance and identifying opportunities for improvement are key drivers for improving plant reliability, production throughput and safe operation.

History  A view of the castle. The site, 23 km from Valladolid, has been fortified since the tenth century, when it is documented in connection with Moorish forays into the region, under Abd al-Rahman III. In the fourteenth century, and until the early fifteenth, it was in the possession of the family of Sandoval; in 1392 it was confiscated from Diego G√≥mez de Sandoval in the name of King Juan II of Castile, who granted it in 1438 to Ruy D√≠az de Mendoza. From 1448 to 1452, Portillo was occasionally held by Juan's favourite, Don √Ålvaro de Luna, although the fortress remained in royal hands. Don √Ålvaro, however, fell from favor, and was detained at Burgos, sent to Portillo until two months later he was tried at Valladolid, and subsequently beheaded in the main Plaza on 2 June 1453. In 1464 Enrique IV of Castile conferred it upon Alfonso, held in trust by Juan Pacheco, the prince's tutor, until his death (1474), though it had been ceded to Rodrigo Alfonso de Pimentel, whose heirs held it until the nineteenth century, when it passed to the family of Osuna. As the history above indicates, Portillo is better known for the list of distinguished prisoners it has housed, than for being the site of battles or other events. Juan II of Castille was briefly imprisoned at Portillo in 1444 by the Conde de Castro, escaping by bribing one of his guardians. The chronicles also touch upon the fact that Don Enrique, brother of the admiral Don Fabrique y de Suero de Qui√±ones (who fought at Paso Honroso) was jailed here for conspiring against the crown. The castle has been a national monument since 1931. It is a property of the University of Valladolid.

From there Brown wrote several letters to acquaintances in Wellington stating that the reason he had left was because of debt. But early investigations into his finances revealed that he appeared to be financially sound.\\"Meeting of A W Browns creditors\\", Evening Post, Volume XLIII, Issue 47, 25 February 1892, Page 3 He was listed as an absconding debtor in Australia's 1892 New South Wales Police Gazette and the Victoria Police Gazette, but by that time he had already left Australia. The New Zealand Police Gazette stated that Brown had left Sydney for Melborne with the intention of heading to America, but stated that he was thought to have gone to Japan. A warrant for his arrest had been issued by the New Zealand Police.New Zealand Police Gazette, 1 June 1892, Page 85 =Mokau Coal Company= Steamer on the Mokau River near the coal mines No motive for his departure came to light initially. He was considered to be financially well off and his estate, when assessed in February or March 1892, was more than adequate to meet its liabilities. Unknown at that time was Brown's exposure to the Mokau Coal Company debts. Character wise, Brown was described as \\"a self-made man, and very proud of his maker\\". Local papers of the time stated that had he remained in Wellington any of the difficulties he was facing could easily have been resolved. He was well liked and had considerable local support. Brown was the Chairman of the Mokau Coal Company. The company collapsed just after his departure, with unpaid wages and debts.\\"The Mokau Coal Company\\", Manawatu Herald, 1 March 1892, Page 2 It is probable that he knew of the impending collapse and considered himself to be financially exposed to the company's debts. By June 1892 his estate was being wound up by the Official Assignee. The amount estimated to be payable to creditors had dropped from almost equal to 3 shillings 6 pence to the pound (20 shillings).

America RMS Oriental Canal Street, New Orleans in 1901 According to his application for naturalisation as a United States citizen, Brown arrived in New York on the City of Chicago on 10 March 1892. The ship had sailed from England and therefore for this to be true Brown must have sailed from Australia to England at the earliest opportunity in February. It is possible that he used an assumed name on these voyages. The date of his arrival in New York, if he was on the City of Chicago, would have either been 25 March at the earliest or possibly 22 April 1892. The ship sailed on the Liverpool to New York route, taking 8 or 9 days to cross the Atlantic. The earliest ship he could have caught from Sydney was a P&O; ship RMS Oriental that sailed on 8 February via Suez and arrived in London on 20 March, which was about 3 days after the City of Chicago's March departure. This would make 22 April the more likely date with a number of alternative ships he could have sailed from Australia on.\\"Shipping brevities\\", Newcastle Morning Herald & Miners' Advocate, Wednesday 30 March 1892, page 4 Australian newspapers of 22 February based on New Zealand reports about letters that had been received there said he was staying in Sydney.New Zealand, Tasmanian News, Hobart, Tasmania, Monday, 22 February 1892, Page 3 The City of Chicago ran aground and sank at Greenland on 22 June 1892. After arriving in New York City Brown then went to Denver, Colorado, where he applied for citizenship on 20 June. His profession was listed as a journalist. On his application his wife was stated to be living in New Orleans. He had selected that he 'was' married, implying that he was separated from her. His death notice in 1916 said he had been resident in New Orleans since 1893. In July 1896, an A W Brown was reported as staying at a New Orleans hotel.The Times-Picayune, 4 July 1896, page 9 Brown and his family appeared in the 1900 United States Census living together in New Orleans. His son was listed as a medical student, but neither Brown or his wife had occupations showing and were listed as Boarders at the address. By the 1920 census only his wife was shown as living in New Orleans. In 1900 Brown worked for The Times Democrat as a reporter and the Daily States as an advertising representative.Standard History of New Orleans, Louisiana: Giving a Description of the Natural Advantages, Natural History ... Settlement, Indians, Creoles, Municipal and Military History, Mercantile and Commercial Interests, Banking, Transportation, Struggles Against High Water, the Press, Educational ... Etc, Henry Rightor, Lewis Publishing Company, 1900, page 281 By 1908 Brown was a part owner of The Shreveport Times until at least 1915 and acted as its secretary-treasurer. He had transferred from the Daily States where he was its business manager, possibly with Robert Ewings acquisition of the paper in 1908. In 1914-1915 Brown was listed as Senior Warden of Winnsbro No 246 Masonic Lodge, Franklin Parish and an eligible member of the Louisiana Grand Lodge.Proceedings of the Grand Lodge of Louisiana, 1914 Brown's son Arthur Bernard had been a member of Louisiana Lodge 102. By 1916 an Brown was Worshipful Master of the Winnsbro Lodge.Proceedings of the Grand Lodge of Louisiana, 1916 Brown died on 27 July 1916 at his home. His obituary stated he had been ill for some 5 years and had suffered a paralytic stroke some two years before he died. He was employed by a newspaper.

It took place on 7‚Äì8 November 1943 during the Bougainville campaign. In response to the Allied landings on Bougainville at Cape Torokina, Japanese General Hitoshi Imamura, commander of the 8th Area Army at Rabaul, determined to launch a counterattack. Underestimating the size of the Allied landing forces, the Japanese dispatched a force of 850 soldiers to execute a counter landing to attempt to drive the Allied forces back into the sea. The Japanese soldiers landed from four destroyers near Koromokina Lagoon on the night of 7 November and engaged two battalions of U.S. Marines from the 3rd and 9th Marine Regiments under the command of Major General Allen H. Turnage. Over the next two days the Japanese attacks were defeated with heavy losses to the attackers. After the battle, Allied forces continued to expand their beachhead on Bougainville with the goal of constructing airfields to attack and neutralize Japanese forces located at Rabaul and nearby areas. Background Responding to the Allied landings on Bougainville at Cape Torokina on 1 November 1943, Japanese General Hitoshi Imamura‚Äîcommander of the 8th Area Army at Rabaul‚Äîdecided to send a force to counter the Allied landing. Imamura intended to deploy about 3,000 troops from Rabaul; however, US air and naval activity prevented this and limited the Japanese to a smaller force.Morison 1958, p. 342 The Japanese commander on Bougainville, Harukichi Hyakutake, dispatched a large group of reinforcements from the 23rd Infantry Regiment from the main Japanese position around Buin, on the southern tip of Bougainville to assault the right flank of the Allied lodgment. Meanwhile, a force of 475 troops was dispatched from Rabaul to the Torokina area to conduct a counter-landing on the left flank in co-ordination with the assault on the right, while a further 700 were sent to reinforce the Japanese garrison at Buka.Miller 1959, p. 259 These troops were drawn from the Japanese Army's 17th Division,Tanaka 1980, p. 73 and included several companies of the 53rd and 54th Infantry Regiments. With the addition of support and service troops, the Japanese landing force amounted to around 850 troops in total.Rentz 1946, Map p. 45; Shaw & Kane 1963, p. 230 Map showing key locations of the Bougainville campaign The Japanese estimated US strength in the area to be between 5,000 and 10,000 troops; in reality over 14,000 troops had been landed around Cape Torokina on the first day. These were followed by another 3,500 on 6 November.Rentz 1946, pp. 46 & 60 These troops were drawn from Major General Allen H. Turnage's 3rd Marine Division, which had landed as part of Rear Admiral Theodore S. Wilkinson's Third Fleet Amphibious Forces.Morison 1958, pp. 297‚Äì298 Following the initial landing operations, Turnage, assisted by Brigadier General Oscar R. Cauldwell,Clark 2006, p. 111 had been in tactical command of the US troops ashore while Lieutenant General Alexander A. Vandegrift returned to Guadalcanal with Wilkinson. As Japanese resistance to the landing petered out, Turnage began reorganizing his forces around the perimeter, establishing patrols and unloading supplies, and commencing important base development work.Shaw & Kane 1963, p. 225; Chapin 1997, p. 11 The force sailed initially on the night of 1 November; however, the force was sighted by US aircraft, and a large US force subsequently dispatched to respond. This convinced the Japanese that a counterlanding at this time would be difficult, with the attempt postponed and the troops returned to Rabaul.Bowser 1947, p. 29. Losses during the naval battle of Empress Augusta Bay, further delayed the sailing of the force and another attempt was cancelled on 5 November after an air raid. The landing force finally departed Rabaul on 6 November, aboard four destroyers.Shaw & Kane 1963, pp. 230‚Äì231 They were covered by a force under Rear Admiral Morikazu Osugi. This force included the cruiser , and the destroyers , , , , and .Morison 1958, p. 341 Battle =Opening moves= Shortly after midnight, the transport group entered the objective area, but the first landing attempt was hurriedly abandoned when Allied ships were discovered blocking the way. The destroyers headed north again and back-tracked closer to the shoreline for a second try.Shaw & Kane 1963, p. 232 A small naval force of eight PT boats had been established by the US Navy around Puruata Island, but none of these boats detected the Japanese force. They unloaded the troops about two miles out from the beaches in Atsinima Bay, with the landing forces going ashore in 21 ramped barges, cutters and motor boats. The landing forces were put ashore near the Laruma River and Koromokina Lagoon and were initially unopposed. The landing had required a bombardment from the naval force; however, due to an Allied fleet nearby, this was not carried out. After the landing, the Japanese destroyers withdrew. Defending US troops were initially confused by the landings, believing that the landing craft were American,Chapin 1997, p. 12 thereby delaying the US response. Meanwhile, Japanese troops cut off a Marine outpost, which was withdrawn the following day by naval landing craft,Miller 1959, p. 260 and occupied several defensive positions that had been abandoned by the Marines the day before during the reorganization.Morison 1958, pp. 341‚Äì342 After a Japanese barge was sighted about north of Cape Torokina, a PT boat was assigned to investigate; however, reports from US 3rd Marine Division troops on that flank of the beachhead confirmed the fact that Japanese barges were landing troops at scattered points along the shoreline and that the Marines were now engaging them. Artillery fire from the 12th Marine Regiment, coastal defense guns and anti-aircraft batteries of the 3rd Defense Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Edward H. Forney opened fire on the Japanese barges and landing beaches. The Japanese landings had scattered over a wide area, typical of landings in darkness and rough surf. Unable to reassemble quickly, the Japanese were initially forced to attack in small numbers; the first attack was carried out by less than 100 Japanese soldiers. The 3rd Battalion, 9th Marine Regiment‚Äîunder the command of Lieutenant Colonel Walter Asmuth, Jr.‚Äîwas tasked with stopping the Japanese counter thrust. Artillery support fire was called down along front of the perimeter and the beach. At 08:20, Company K, 3rd Battalion‚Äîwith a platoon from regimental weapons company in support‚Äîset out, tasked with the Japanese counterattack. About from the main line of resistance, the advancing Marines hit the front of the enemy force. The Japanese, seeking cover from the artillery fire, had dug-in rapidly and, by taking advantage of abandoned foxholes and emplacements of the departed 1st and 2nd Battalions, 9th Marine Regiment, had established a hasty but effective defensive position.Shaw & Kane 1963, pp. 232‚Äì233 Heavy fighting broke out with the Japanese firing light machine guns from well-concealed fortifications covered by automatic rifle fire from snipers hidden in trees. Company K's attack stalled and was pinned down; their advance was halted. Japanese resistance increased as reinforcements from the remainder of the counterlanding force began to arrive. At 13:15, the 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment who were in reserve, was ordered into the battle, being transferred from the right flank of the US beachhead. Company K provided covering fire while Company B of the 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment moved across the left flank and passed through Company K to take up the fight. Company C of the 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment moved forward on the right flank and Company K withdrew, having lost five killed and 13 wounded. Of the 13 wounded, two later died.Shaw & Kane 1963, p. 233 =Tank support= Map depicting the fighting around Koromokina Lagoon, 7/8 November 1943 The two companies of the 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment‚Äîunder the command of Major John P. Brody‚Äîfound the going tough as the Japanese positions were well-hidden, and they found themselves under heavy machine gun and automatic weapons fire. Tanks moved up to help with the assault, and the Marines advanced slowly as the tank fire eliminated the enemy emplacements. Late that afternoon, the advance was halted and a heavy artillery concentration, in preparation for a full-scale attack by the 1st Battalion, 21st Marine Regiment against the enemy defenses in front of the Marines. The artillery fire raged through the enemy positions and Companies B and C placed mortar fire almost on top of their own positions.Shaw & Kane 1963, pp. 233‚Äì234 The attack by the 1st Battalion, 21st Marine Regiment‚Äîunder the command of Lieutenant Colonel Ernest W. Fry, Jr.‚Äîwas set for 17:00, but it was postponed until the next morning (8 November).Shaw & Kane 1963, p. 234 Throughout the night, groups of Japanese troops pushed through US defensive lines, threatening the field hospital that had been established by the 3rd Medical Battalion. A hasty defense was mounted by rear echelon troops, subsequently turned back the assault, protecting the medical staff.Clark 2006, p. 108; Chapin 1997, p. 12 Several Marine units had been cut off from the main forces during 7 November. One of these, a platoon from Company K, 3rd Battalion, 9th Marine Regiment had scouted the upper Laruma River region, and ambushed a pursuing Japanese patrol several times before escaping into the interior. The platoon returned to the Marine lines 30 hours later, with one man wounded and one man missing after inflicting a number of casualties on the Japanese landing force. Another patrol from Company M, 3rd Battalion, 9th Marine Regiment was cut off on the beach between two enemy forces and when the radio of the artillery officer with the patrol had failed, he headed back to the main lines directing an artillery barrage that landed on the Japanese position to the left of the patrol from Company M. The patrol then moved toward the Marine lines, only to find the beach blocked by Japanese forces opposing Company K. A message was written in the sand of the beach, which was seen by an air spotter with two tank lighters evacuating the patrol from the beach. Sixty men were evacuated successfully after killing an estimated 35 Japanese. Only two of the Marines had been wounded. Two other Marine groups became isolated in the fighting along the perimeter. One platoon from the 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment‚Äîscouting the Japanese flank position‚Äîslipped through the jungle and passed by the enemy force without being observed. Choosing to head for the beach instead of the interior, the platoon struggled to the coast. There, the patrol cleaned its weapons with gasoline from a wrecked barge, and spent the night in the jungle. The next morning, the attention of an Allied plane was attracted and within an hour the platoon was picked up by a tank lighter and returned to the main lines. The other isolated unit‚Äîa patrol from Company B‚Äîwas cut off from the rest of the battalion during the fighting and spent the night of 7‚Äì8 November behind Japanese lines without detection.Shaw & Kane 1963, pp. 234‚Äì235 After a 20-minute preparatory barrage by five batteries of artillery together with machine gun, mortar and antitank-gun fire on the morning of 8 November, the 1st Battalion, 21st Marine Regiment passed through the lines of the 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment companies and began the attack. The infantry were supported by light tanks. Only a few Japanese soldiers fought off the attack with these being killed or captured. More than 250 dead Japanese were found in the area.Chapin 1997, p. 14 Moving about through the jungle parallel to the shoreline, no further opposition was encountered. That afternoon, a defensive line was established behind a lagoon and extensive patrols were sent out without making contact with the Japanese.Shaw & Kane 1963, p. 235 On the morning of 9 November, the area between the Marine positions and the Laruma River was bombed and strafed by American dive bombers from Munda Airfield on New Georgia. Patrols found the bodies of many Japanese, who had taken refuge in the Laruma River area. There was no further enemy activity on the left flank of the perimeter, and at noon of that day, control of the sector passed to the US 148th Infantry Regiment of the 37th Division, which had just arrived. The battalion from the 9th Marines moved to the right flank, and the 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment withdrew to the 3rd Marine Regiment area. The 1st Battalion, 21st Marine Regiment held the left-flank and remained under operational control of the 148th Regiment until other units of the 37th Division arrived. Aftermath The Japanese attempt to destroy the Allied landing force by counter-landing had failed, due to underestimating the size of the Allied landing forces, and also due to being unable to co-ordinate their actions on both sides of the perimeter.Shaw & Kane 1963, p. 236. Out of a force of 850 soldiers which were sent, only 475 were landed. At least 377 were killed, the rest withdrew into the jungle. Most of those were killed in the artillery barrages and air strikes between 7 and 9 November. For the Japanese, the landing site was also an unfortunate choice: its location was very close to that of the Allied beachhead, which the Japanese believed to be further east around Cape Torokina. In addition, the Japanese had chosen to assault over such a large front that they had been unable to concentrate in sufficient numbers to take advantage of the initial surprise they had achieved.Rentz 1946, p. 46 The Marines lost 17 killed and 30 wounded. One Marine, Sergeant Herbert Thomas, received the Medal of Honor posthumously for his actions during the battle, throwing himself on a grenade to protect several other Marines.Chapin 1997, p. 14; Rentz 1946, p. 43 Fighter strip at Torokina, December 1943 On 9 November, Major General Roy Geiger assumed command of I Marine Amphibious Corps, replacing Vandegrift. Four days later, he assumed command of all Allied forces on Bougainville and in the immediate vicinity.Miller 1959, p. 257; Morison 1958, p. 348 Following the fighting around Koromokina Lagoon, the Japanese 23rd Infantry Regiment began arriving from the south, and subsequently launched an attack on a US force holding a roadblock around the junction of the Piva and Numa Numa Trails, which were important avenues of approach towards the Allied beachhead. The subsequent Battle for Piva Trail, resulted in heavy casualties for the Japanese, with around 550 killed.Chapin 1997, pp. 14‚Äì17; Clark 2006, p. 108 After this, US Army elements began arriving in force to reinforce the Marines, as further echelons arrived at Cape Torokina, bringing more supplies and expanding the size of US forces on Bougainville further. A further 5,715 troops had landed on 8 November, followed by another 3,599 and 6,678 on 11 and 13 November. With the beachhead secure, and command having transitioned ashore,Morison 1958, p. 348 US forces slowly pushed their perimeter forward, systematically advancing to several inland defense lines, resulting in further actions around Coconut Grove, Piva Forks and Hellzapoppin Ridge and Hill 600A.Rentz 1946, pp. 39‚Äì40; Shaw & Kane 1963, pp. 247‚Äì267 Initially, Japanese commanders believed that the landing at Cape Torokina was only temporary and would be followed up by another move on Buka. As a result, they held off launching a concerted counterattack even though there were up to 15,000 troops available in southern Bougainville.Morison 1958, pp. 348‚Äì349. Meanwhile, further base development saw the Allies establish several airfields inside the Torokina perimeter, which were used to project airpower towards the main Japanese base at Rabaul, while Japanese sea lanes of communication between Rabaul and Bougainville were heavily interdicted. As the conditions necessary for a large-scale counterattack faded, the Japanese 17th Army commander, Hyakutake, was ordered to delay his plans, postponing the assault on Torokina until March 1944.Tanaka 1980, pp. 73 & 255‚Äì275 Notes References   Further reading    Category:Pacific Ocean theatre of World War II Category:South West Pacific theatre of World War II Category:1943 in Papua New Guinea Category:Battles and operations of World War II involving Papua New Guinea Category:Autonomous Region of Bougainville Category:Battles of World War II involving Japan Category:Battles of World War II involving the United States Category:1943 in Japan Category:United States Marine Corps in World War II Category:November 1943 events ","title":"Battle of Koromokina Lagoon"},{"id":"13595556","text":"University of the Sacred Heart may refer to: *University of the Sacred Heart (Puerto Rico) in Puerto Rico *University of the Sacred Heart (Japan) in Japan *University of the Sacred Heart Gulu, in Uganda *Universit√† Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, with campuses in several cities in Italy *Universidade do Sagrado Cora√ß√£o, in Brazil ","title":"University of the Sacred Heart"},{"id":"13595572","text":"The Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) is a government agency in the state of Maryland charged with maintaining natural resources including state parks, public lands, state forests, state waterways, wildlife and recreation areas.

Those functions are the responsibility of the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE).Maryland Department of the Environment. Organizational history DNR was established in 1969 as part of a reorganization of the Maryland executive branch initiated by the 56th Governor of Maryland Marvin Mandel (1920‚Äì2015, served 1969‚Äì1979). DNR assumed the responsibilities formerly held by the earlier Maryland Board of Natural Resources (established in 1941), and consolidated the agency's authority under a single cabinet-level department secretary. The first DNR secretary was former Maryland 54th Governor J. Millard Tawes, who served in that capacity until 1971. Other notable DNR secretaries have included James Coulter (1971‚Äì1983) and Torrey C. Brown (1983‚Äì1995). The department is headquartered in the Tawes State Office building at 580 Taylor Avenue in Annapolis.Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR). Annapolis, Maryland. (2014). \\"Department of Natural Resources.\\" Leadership and management Natural Resources Secretary Mark J. Belton was appointed in 2015. The Deputy Secretary is Joanne Throwe. =Mission Support= The Mission Support organization includes Human Resources Services, Leadership/Employee Development, Office of Fair Practices, Licensing and Registration Services, Finance and Administration Service, Audit and Management Review, and Information Technology.DNR (7/1/2014). \\"DNR Organizational Chart.\\" = Land Resources = Land Resources includes the Park Service, Forest Service, Wildlife and Heritage Service, Land Acquisition and Planning, Engineering and Construction, and the Maryland Environmental Trust.  Maryland Park Service  The mission of the Maryland Park Service is to manage the natural, cultural, historical, and recreational resources to provide for wise stewardship and enjoyment by people. The Service manages 66 state parks. Services include camping, biking, boating and fishing, hiking, outdoor programs, and exploring natural resources. The Service consists of both civilian and law enforcement rangers.  Wildlife and Trees  DNR closely regulates wildlife, tracking diseases and populations. During the previous hunting season there was a lone reported case of a hunter legally taking a deer only to find out later that the deer tagged was infected with Chronic Wasting Disease, CWD. CWD is a neurological disease that effect deer elk and moose, where the infected have symptoms such as loss of body condition, behavioral abnormalities, and even death (Learn). People are warned to avoid contact with the brain, spinal cord, and lymph nodes because these are the areas that become infected. To help control this problem each year the MD-DNR takes samples from the deer harvested to test for any signs of CWD. The main focus is in the western Maryland counties due to the reports of CWD in West Virginia and Virginia (Communications, 2011). The DNR is also responsible for regulating the of wooded land in Maryland. There are over 160 species of trees that help create these millions of acres of forest. This abundant acreage makes the forest industry one of the biggest businesses in the state, with more than 18,000 people reliant on wood products. In the two westernmost counties, Garrett and Allegany, forestry is the largest employer. Over the years there have been many contributing factors that have diminished some of the wooded areas around the state. Since the early 1980s, almost half a million acres (4,000 km¬≤) have been infested with gypsy moths that destroyed forests. There are also the Southern Pine bark beetles that have caused excessive damage to the pine trees on the Eastern Shore. Another reason for damage to the forestry is the cover fires that occur every year. The spring and the fall are the prime times for fires because of the climate changes. There are more than 6,000 fires destroying 8,000‚Äì10,000 acres each year in Maryland. = Aquatic Resources = Aquatic Resources includes Chesapeake and Coastal Service, Boating Services, Fisheries Service, Resources Assessment Service, Integrated Policy and Review and the Critical Area Commission.  Maryland Waters  Maryland is a state with many water resources, from the Chesapeake to the Potomac River. The Department of Natural Resources has been monitoring the water sources and the Chesapeake Bay and other assorted small streams since 1996. The goal is to manage the restoration and protection of these waterways and that ensures Maryland residents get clean water and can participate in activities such canoeing, fishing, and growing crops. DNR has a huge research and development team committed to providing the best and cleanest possible water sources. Many researched topics include geomorphic assessments, atmospheric and acid deposition, and long term water quality.  Streams, Stream Life and Fishing  Streams stretch all over Maryland and contain many exotic species of fish and other water life. Maryland's streams' biodiversity does not end with just fish and birds but extends to salamanders, mussels, 10 types of turtles and over 100 species of fish. Plants and vegetation surrounding the aquatic habitats provide nutrients, shelter for animals, temperature regulation and can provide erosion control. DNR has established groups to survey all streams and wildlife. One of these groups is Monitoring and Non-Tidal Assessment (MANTA) and another is the state's portion of the National Rivers and Streams Assessment (managed nationally by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency). Both actively participate in keeping aquatic areas clean and safe. Both of these organizations have websites and statistics on the previous reports of the health of Maryland streams and waters. DNR recognizes both commercial and non commercial fishing and keeps reports of the breeds and sizes of fish caught on their website.  Boating  The DNR offers many boating services to people of all ages and types of boaters including paddle, sailing, and power boats. Boating programs are financed completely through the DNR Waterway Improvement Fund and have now developed over 300 public boating areas throughout Maryland. The revenue that is acquired from this fund comes from a 5 percent vessel tax that is paid when anyone titles a vessel in the state of Maryland. Natural Resources Police The Maryland Department of Natural Resources Police is the law enforcement arm of the Department of Natural Resources. Natural Resources Police Officers patrol state-owned lands and enforce conservation and boating laws as well as Maryland's Criminal Law and Transportation Article. Additional services include homeland security, search and rescue, emergency medical services, and educational programs.DNR.

Collett was born in Sheffield and played for his working men's club team in Oughtibridge, before moving to Arsenal in 1933. He would remain on the club's book for sixteen years, although he only played 20 matches in this time. He played at wing half and was mainly a reserve, having to wait four and a half years to make his first-team debut, which he did away to Stoke City at the Victoria Ground in a First Division match on 23 October 1937; he went on to make five appearances that season, as Arsenal won the League title. Collett's best run in the Arsenal season was in 1938‚Äì39, when he made nine appearances deputising for Wilf Copping at left half. However, soon after that World War II began and league football was suspended. Collett still managed to make 187 unofficial appearances for Arsenal in wartime matches, winning two wartime league winners medals in 1939‚Äì40 and 1941‚Äì42. In June 1940, he was one of five Arsenal players who guested for Southampton in a victory over Fulham at Craven Cottage. He also guested for Brentford, playing (and winning) the London War Cup final with them in 1941‚Äì42. Collett played another six league games in 1946‚Äì47 before stepping down from the Arsenal first-team entirely, though he continued to play reserve-team football until 1949. After his retirement from playing, he became a member of the club's backroom staff ‚Äì he was at first George Male's assistant in coaching Arsenal's youth team, before moving into scouting, eventually became the club's chief scout, a job he held until his retirement in 1979; in total he was with Arsenal for 46 years, making him one of the club's most enduring servants. Ernie Collett died in 1980, after being struck in an accident by a fire engine, aged 65.

Members of the Science Fiction Writers of America selected it as one of the best science fiction stories published before the advent of the Nebula Awards, and as such it was included in The Science Fiction Hall of Fame Volume One, 1929-1964. The Star Trek episode \\"Arena\\" had some similarity to this story, so to avoid legal problems, it was agreed that Brown would receive payment and a story credit. An Outer Limits episode, \\"Fun and Games\\", also has a similar plot, as does an episode of Blake's 7, titled \\"Duel\\" and an episode of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe titled \\"The Arena\\". Marvel Comics' Worlds Unknown issue 4 (November 1973) featured a faithful adaptation of the story. Plot summary Amid escalating conflict between Earth and mysterious alien Outsiders, massive armadas from both sides are set to meet in what looks to be an evenly matched battle. Bob Carson, the pilot of a small one-man scout ship blacks out while engaging with an Outsider counterpart. When he awakens, he finds himself naked in a small enclosed, circular area about across. In the distance is an Outsider, which Carson labels a \\"Roller\\" because its form is that of a red sphere about in diameter with several dozen tentacles. Carson hears a voice in his mind that identifies itself as an evolved intelligence that has decided to intervene because the upcoming war would utterly destroy one side and hurt the other so badly that it would not be able to one day advance into an evolved intelligence like itself. This Entity therefore chose one individual from each species to fight in single combat. The loser will doom its kind to instant extinction. Carson and his opponent discover through trial and error that there is an invisible barrier between them, and that only inanimate objects can cross it. Carson tries to communicate with the Roller, to see if a compromise is possible, but receives a mental message of unremitting hatred. Carson is wounded in the leg. Inspired by seeing the Roller throw an unconscious lizard across the barrier, he knocks himself out on a slope and rolls through to the other side. He regains consciousness and kills the Roller using a knife knapped from a flint-like rock. Carson immediately finds himself back in his scout ship. He receives a jubilant message from his commander informing him that Earth's first salvo somehow caused the entire enemy fleet to disintegrate, even the ships that were out of range. When Carson sees several newly healed scars where he had been wounded, he knows he did not imagine the fight, but wisely decides to keep his experience to himself.

Traditionally it is known as a Bhagavath Sastra as Sri Vikhanasar is created by Lord Sriman Narayana from His soul. This Agama has more than 15 million verses in Sanskrit detailing the worshipping rituals and procedures including the daily activities and annual Hindu festivities to be done at Hindu Temples. Almost half of the temples in South India follow this protocol of Worship of their Hindu gods and goddesses. The other important Agama for Hindus is the 'pancharatra agama' which is laying down the worship protocol of Lord Vishnu at temples. The famous temples of South India - Tirumala Tirupathi, Tiruvallikeni, Sri Villiputhoor, Thirumal irum cholai, Tirukovilur, Tiruneermalai, Gunaseelam, Tirukkadal Mallai, Tiruvidavendhai, Sri Oppiliappan koil, Tirukannapuram, Tiruvahindipuram and many other are following the Sri Vaikanasam-based Agamic rituals and procedures. This is the first worship protocol foremost to all others (Pancharatham, etc.) which was begun for how to worship Lord Vishnu. This protocol has 8 divisions. Sri Vikhanasar has four disciples , namely \\"Athri\\",\\"Brughu\\",\\"Mareechi\\",\\"Kashyapar\\". One of the disciple started new protocols for saivam, etc. Those that belong to this Bhagavath Sastra are known to be part of Sri Vaikanasa archaka society. They are having privilege to worship and be the Priests at Temples just by their birth and no special sanctity or qualification is required for them to enter priesthood.

Biography  Talmud and the Jews. vol. 6 cover He studied and was ordained a Catholic priest in Russia. He was defrocked for alleged offenses, including theft and embezzlement, which were later not proven. Thereafter he converted to Russian Orthodoxy and joined a religious academy as a student. He was famous for writing The Talmud and the Jews (–¢–∞–ª–º—É–¥ –∏ –µ–≤—Ä–µ–∏), for which he was awarded by the tzar and his officials.  Political claims  = Blood libel = About using Christian Blood by the Jews His books and his public statements claimed blood libel. = Jewish plot = He maintained that Jews wanted to divide Russia among themselves, once they left the Pale of Settlement, furthering the claims laid in the antisemitic works of Osman Bey (pen name of Frederick Millingen) The Conquest of the World by the Jews, and contributing to the creation of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. In 1904 he directly quoted Pavel Krushevan's version; without revision, but with useful chronological evidence in an updated edition of his The Talmud and the Jews book. (See main article Cesare G. De Michelis about the versions.) = Zionism = He declared himself to be a Zionist and proposed that \\"Russia should make any sacrifice to help the Jews settle in Palestine and form an autonomous state of their own\\". = Racial discrimination = To thus pressure Jews to emigrate and to protect state security against Jewish political activists, he proposed racial quotas, segregation, discrimination, disenfranchisement, presaging Nazi policies and apartheid and anti-immigration legislation: > * All privileges granted to Jews because of their education or because of > their occupations should be withdrawn. > * No Jews should be permitted to live in seaports. > * Jewish children should not be permitted to attend schools attended by > Christian children. > * Jews should also be prohibited from establishing schools of their own. > * Jews should be forbidden to teach in Government or private schools. > * Jews should not be permitted to hold any Government or civil office. > * Jews should not be permitted to get any concessions and should not be > connected with any Government contracts. > * Jews should not be employed on any steamship or railway in Russia. > * Jews should not be permitted to vote, and under no circumstances should > they be permitted to serve in the Duma or the Council of the Empire. > * Nor should they be allowed to participate in the elections. > * Jews should not be permitted to have drugstores of their own, to be > druggists, or to work as clerks in such stores. > * Jews in any way connected with revolutionists should be dealt with > harshly, and their property should be confiscated. > * Jews should not be permitted to act as editors or publishers of periodical > publications. > * Jews should not be permitted to have bookstores and printing shops. > * All foreign Jews, citizens of other countries, should be forbidden to > enter Russia. = British Israelism = He also promoted British Israelism: > \\"The English people are the lost tribes of Israel.

The Faculty of Behavioural Sciences is the largest in Southeast Asia for a private educational institution. HELP University was the first private educational institution to offer a degree in Psychology in Malaysia. Its origins were in the mid-1990s when the university college realised that students needed counselling and psychological services, and employed counsellors so that students may approach them for help. From then onwards, psychology at HELP University grew with more services offered to students and staff, and culminated in the establishment of programmes and degrees, and a faculty that specialises in Psychology and Behavioural Sciences. The Faculty of Behavioural Sciences is involved with World Vision Malaysia, and UNICEF in many projects, notably the World Vision 30 Hour Famine, and other research projects. =Business Studies Department= The Faculty of Business, Economics and Accounting is a comprehensive business, hospitality and tourism management school distinguished for the quality of its academic staff, the depth of its programmes, the recognition accorded by world class universities, accreditation from professional bodies and its close links with the industry. It was formed in 1986 at the inception of HELP in the same year. At present, we are the largest academic faculty in HELP University with an enrolment of 2,500 undergraduate students. Graduates of HELP's Bachelor of Business (Accounting) programme can apply to be an associate member of CPA Australia without having to sit for the qualifying exam. HELP's Bachelor of Business (Accounting) degree is recognised by the United Kingdom ICAEW and ACCA for full credit exemptions. =The Department of University of London International Programmes= HELP was the first educational institution in the world to offer the University of London External Programme‚Äôs Diploma in Economics outside of the United Kingdom in 1986.

He was probably a younger son of Somairle mac Gilla Brigte, Lord of Argyll and his wife, Ragnhildr, daughter of √ìl√°fr Gu√∞r√∏√∞arson, King of the Isles. The twelfth-century Kingdom of the Isles, ruled by Ragnall's father and maternal- grandfather, existed within a hybrid Norse-Gaelic milieu, which bordered an ever strengthening and consolidating Kingdom of Scots. In the mid twelfth century, Somairle rose in power and won the Kingdom of the Isles from his brother-in-law. After Somairle perished in battle against the Scots in 1164, much of his kingdom was probably partitioned between his surviving sons. Ragnall's allotment appears to have been in the southern Hebrides and Kintyre. In time, Ragnall appears to have risen in power and became the leading member of Somairle's descendants, the meic Somairle (or Clann Somairle). Ragnall is known to have styled himself \\"King of the Isles, Lord of Argyll and Kintyre\\" and \\"Lord of the Isles\\". His claim to the title of king, like other members of the meic Somairle, is derived through Ragnhildr, a member of the Crovan dynasty. Ragnall disappears from record after he and his sons were defeated by his brother √Åengus. Ragnall's death-date is unknown, although certain dates between 1191 and 1227 are all possibilities. Surviving contemporary sources reveal that Ragnall was a significant patron of the Church. Although his father appears to have aligned himself with traditional forms of Christianity, Ragnall himself is associated with newer reformed religious orders from the continent. Ragnall's now non-existent seal, which pictured a knight on horseback, also indicates that he attempted to present himself as an up-to- date ruler, not unlike his Anglo-French contemporaries of the bordering Kingdom of Scots. Ragnall is known to have left two sons, Ruaidr√≠ and Domnall, who went on to found powerful Hebridean families. Either Ragnall or Ruaidr√≠ had daughters who married Ragnall's first cousins R«´gnvaldr and √ìl√°fr, two thirteenth-century kings of the Crovan dynasty. Origins of the meic Somairle Map of the divided Kingdom of the Isles, .McDonald (2007) p. 25. The lands of the Crovan dynasty bordering those of the meic Somairle. Ragnall was a son of Somairle mac Gilla Brigte, Lord of Argyll (died 1164) and his wife, Ragnhildr, daughter of √ìl√°fr Gu√∞r√∏√∞arson, King of the Isles. Somairle and Ragnhildr had at least three sons: Dubgall (died after 1175), Ragnall, √Åengus (died 1210), and probably also a fourth, Amla√≠b.Sellar (2004); Sellar (2000) p. 195. Dubgall appears to have been the couple's eldest son.Sellar (2000) p. 199, p. 199 n. 51; Duncan; Brown (1957) p. 197. Little is certain of the origins of Ragnall's father, although his marriage suggests that he belonged to a family of some substance. In the first half of the twelfth century, the Hebrides and the Isle of Man (Mann) were encompassed within the Kingdom of the Isles, which was ruled by Somairle's father-in-law, a member of the Crovan dynasty. Somairle's rise to power may well have begun at about this time, as the few surviving sources from the era suggest that Argyll may have begun to slip from the control of David I, King of Scots (died 1153).Woolf (2004) p. 103. Somairle first appears on record in 1153, when he rose in rebellion with his nephews, the sons of the royal pretender M√°el Coluim mac Alaxandair (fl. 1134), against the recently enthroned M√°el Coluim IV, King of Scots (died 1165).Oram (2011) pp. 111‚Äì112; Sellar (2004); Anderson (1922) pp. 223‚Äì224. In the same year, Somairle's father-in-law was murdered after ruling the Kingdom of the Isles about forty years. √ìl√°fr was succeeded by his son, Gu√∞r√∏√∞r; and sometime afterwards, Somairle participated in a coup within the kingdom by presenting Dubgall as a potential king. In consequence, Somairle and his brother-in-law fought a naval battle in 1156, after which much of the Hebrides appear to have fallen under Somairle's control.Sellar (2004); Duncan; Brown (1957) p. 196; Anderson (1922) pp. 230‚Äì232; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 68‚Äì69. Two years later, he defeated Gu√∞r√∏√∞ar outright and took control of the entire island-kingdom.Sellar (2004); Duncan; Brown (1957) p. 196; Anderson (1922) p. 239; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 68‚Äì69. In 1164, Somairle again rose against the King of Scots, and is recorded in various early sources to have commanded a massive invasion force of men from throughout the Isles, Argyll, Kintyre, and Scandinavian Dublin. Somairle's host sailed up the Clyde, and made landfall near what is today Renfrew, where they were crushed by the Scots, and he himself was slain.Sellar (2004); Duncan; Brown (1957) p. 197; Anderson (1922) pp. 253‚Äì258; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 74‚Äì75. Following Somairle's demise, Gu√∞r√∏√∞r returned to the Isles and seated himself on Mann, although the Hebridean-territories won by Somairle in 1156 were retained by his descendants, the meic Somairle.Sellar (2004); Duncan; Brown (1957) p. 197; Anderson (1922) pp. 471‚Äì472; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 74‚Äì75. Although contemporary sources are silent on the matter, it is more than likely that on Somairle's demise, his territory was divided amongst his surviving sons. The precise allotment of lands is unknown; even though the division of lands amongst later generations of meic Somairle can be readily discerned, such boundaries are unlikely to have existed during the chaotic twelfth century. It is possible that the territory of the first generation of meic Somairle may have stretched from Glenelg in the north, to the Mull of Kintyre in the south; with √Åengus ruling in the north, Dubgall centred in Lorne (with possibly the bulk of the inheritance), and Ragnall in Kintyre and the southern islands.Duncan; Brown (1957) p. 198. Internal conflict Broderick; Stowell (1973) p. 70 (¬ß 57); Munch; Goss (1874a) p. 80; Cotton MS Julius A VII (n.d.). Little is known of Somairle's descendants in the decades following his demise.Oram (2011) p. 156; Duncan; Brown (1957) p. 197. Dubgall does not appear on record until 1175, when he is attested far from the Isles in Durham, by the Durham Cathedral's Liber Vitae.Woolf (2007) p. 79; Sellar (2000) p. 195; Duncan; Brown (1957) pp. 197‚Äì198; Lawrie (1910) p. 204; Stevenson (1841) pp. 4, 135. Nothing is certain of Dubgall's later activities, and it is possible that, by the 1180s, Ragnall had begun to encroach upon Dubgall's territories and his position as head of the meic Somairle.Oram (2011) p. 156. The fact that Dubgall is not accorded any title by the Liber Vitae could be evidence that Ragnall had displaced him upon Somairle's demise, or that the chronicle's account of Dubgall's connection with the kingship is merely the work of thirteenth-century bias favouring the powerful meic Dubgaill, Dubgaill's descendants.Woolf (2007) p. 79. In 1192, the Chronicle of Mann records that Ragnall and his sons were defeated in a particularly bloody battle against √Åengus.Oram (2011) p. 157; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 247; McDonald (1997) pp. 74‚Äì75; Broderick; Stowell (1973) pp. 27 (¬ß 57), 70 (¬ß 57); Duncan; Brown (1957) p. 198; Anderson (1922) p. 327; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 80‚Äì81. The chronicle does not identify the location of the battle, or elaborate under what circumstances it was fought. However, it is possible that the conflict took place in the northern part of the meic Somairle domain, where some of √Åengus' lands may have lain. Although the hostile contact between Ragnall and √Åengus could have been result of Ragnall's rise in power at Dubgall's expense,McDonald (1997) pp. 74‚Äì75. the clash of 1192 may also mark Ragnall's downfall.Woolf (2004) p. 105. seal of Alan fitz Walter, Steward of Scotland. One of several ecclesiastical sources that deal specifically with Ragnall is an undated grant to the Cluniac priory at Paisley.McDonald (2004) pp. 195‚Äì196; McDonald (1995b) pp. 211‚Äì212. Since this grant probably dates to the period after Ragnall's defeat to √Åengus, it may be evidence of an attempt made by Ragnall to secure an alliance with Alan fitz Walter, Steward of Scotland (died 1204).Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 246‚Äì248; Murray (2005) p. 288; Oram (2000) p. 111 n. 95. The patrons of this priory were members of Alan's own family,Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 247‚Äì248; Murray (2005) p. 288. a powerful kindred that had recently begun to expand its influence westwards from Renfrew, to the frontier of the Scottish realm and the fringes of Argyll.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 243. Since Bute seems to have fallen into the hands of this kindred at about the time of Ragnall's grant, it is possible that Alan took advantage of the internal conflict between the meic Somairle, and seized the island before 1200.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 247. Alternately, Alan may have received the island from Ragnall as payment for military support against √Åengus, who appears to have gained the upper hand over Ragnall by 1192.Oram (2011) p. 157; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 247; Murray (2005) p. 288. Alan's expansion and influence in territories outwith the bounds of the Scottish kingdom may have been perceived as a threat by William I, King of Scots (died 1214), and may partly explain the king's construction of a royal castle at Ayr in 1195. This fortress extended Scottish royal authority into the outer Firth of Clyde region, and was probably intended to dominate not only William's peripheral barons, but also independent rulers just beyond the borders of the Scottish realm.Oram (2011) p. 157; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 246‚Äì248; Murray (2005) p. 288. In fact, Alan's westward expansion appears to have suddenly ceased at about 1200, and may have been a consequence of royal anxiety concerning an alliance with Ragnall.Oram (2000) p. 132. Titles and seal A royal inspection of Saddell Abbey, dated to 1508, reveals that Ragnall styled himself in a Latin charter to the abbey rex insularum, dominus de Ergile et KyntyreSellar (2000) p. 195; Barrow (1992) p. 25 n. 9; Paul 1882 p. 678 (¬ß3170); H3/30/1 (n.d.). (\\"King of the Isles, Lord of Argyll and Kintyre\\"), a title which may indicate that Ragnall claimed all the possessions of his father.Sellar (2000) p. 195. In what is probably a later charter,McDonald (1997) p. 74; Duncan; Brown (1957) p. 198, 198 n. 8. Ragnall is styled in Latin dominus de InchegalSellar (2000) p. 195; Registrum Monasterii de Passelet ... (1832) p. 125; H3/30/3 (n.d.). (\\"Lord of the Isles\\")McDonald (1997) pp. 73‚Äì74. in his grant to the priory of Paisley. Although Ragnall's abandonment of the title \\"king\\" in favour of \\"lord\\" may not be significant,Sellar (2000) p. 195 n. 37. it could be connected with his defeat to √Åengus, or to the expansion and rise in power of Ragnall's namesake and first cousin R«´gnvaldr Gu√∞r√∏√∞arson, King of the Isles (died 1229).McDonald (1997) p. 74; McDonald (1995b) p. 135; Duncan; Brown (1957) p. 198. The style dominus de Inchegal is not unlike dominus Insularum (\\"Lord of the Isles\\"), a title first adopted in 1336 by Ragnall's great-great-grandson, Eoin Mac Domhnaill, Lord of the Isles (died ), the first of four successive Lords of the Isles.Munro; Munro (2004); Sellar (2000) p. 195 n. 37; McDonald (1997) pp. 2, 187. Ragnall's grant to the priory of Paisley is preserved in two documents: one dates to the late twelfth- or early thirteenth century, and a later copy is contained in an instrument which dates to 1426.McDonald (1995b) p. 129. Appended to the latter document is a description of a seal impressed in white wax, which the fifteenth-century notary alleged to have belonged to Ragnall. On one side, the seal is described to have depicted a ship, filled with men-at-arms. On the reverse side, the seal was said to have depicted a man on horseback, armed with a sword in his hand.McDonald (1997) p. 75; McDonald (1995b) p. 130; Registrum Monasterii de Passelet ... (1832) p. 149. Ragnall is the only member of the meic Somairle known to have styled himself in documents rex insularum.Sellar (2000) p. 198. His use of both the title and seal are probably derived from those of the leading members of the Crovan dynasty, such as his namesake R«´gnvaldr, who not only bore the same title but was said to have borne a similar two-sided seal.McDonald (2004) pp. 192‚Äì193 n. 49; Sellar (2000) p. 198; McDonald (1997) p. 75; McDonald (1995b) p. 131. The descriptions of the cousins' seals shows that these devices combined the imagery of a Norse-Gaelic galley and an Anglo-French knight. The maritime imagery probably symbolised the power of a ruler of an island-kingdom, and the equestrian imagery appears to have symbolised feudal society, in which the cult of knighthood had reached its peak in the twelfth- and early thirteenth centuries.McDonald (1997) pp. 75‚Äì76; McDonald (1995b) pp. 135‚Äì136, 142. The use of such seals by leading Norse-Gaelic lords, seated on the periphery of the kingdoms of Scotland and England, probably illustrates their desire to present themselves as up-to-date and modern to their contemporaries in Anglo- French society.McDonald (2004) pp. 192‚Äì193 n. 49; McDonald (1995b) pp. 133, 142. Norse-Gaelic namesake Simplified family tree concerning the descendants of √ìl√°fr Gu√∞r√∏√∞arson, specifically his grandsons Ragnall and R«´gnvaldr. The latter was almost certainly a paternal grandson of Affraic ingen Fergusa,McDonald (2007) p. 27 tab. 1.; Duffy (2004b); Sellar (2000) p. 192 tab. ii. and there is reason to suspect that Ragnall was a maternal grandson of Ingibj«´rg P√°lsd√≥ttir.Williams (2007) p. 141 illus. 14, 145-148; Sellar (2000) pp. 191, 192 tab. ii, 198. The Gaelic Ragnall corresponds to the Old Norse R«´gnvaldr. Both names were Latinised to Reginaldus.Power (2013) p. 72; McDonald (2007) p. 13. The fact that two closely related Hebridean rulers, Ragnall and R«´gnvaldr, shared the same personal names, the same grandfather, and (at times) the same title, has perplexed modern historians and possibly mediaeval chroniclers as well.Williams (2007) pp. 147‚Äì148. =Conquest in Caithness= Locations of Ross, Caithness, Orkney, and Norway in comparison to Argyll and the Isles (the Hebrides and Mann). A particular thorn in the side of the Scottish Crown at the turn of the thirteenth century was Haraldr Madda√∞arson, Earl of Orkney and Caithness (died 1206).Crawford (2004a). At some point in the last half of the twelfth century, Haraldr put aside his first wife, a daughter of an Earl of Fife, and married Hvarfl«´√∞, a daughter of an Earl of Ross.Crawford (2004b) p. 30; Topping (1983) pp. 112-113; Anderson (1922) p. 348 n. 1. The latter woman was a member of the powerful meic √Åedha, a northern kindred who had been in open conflict with the Scottish Crown throughout the twelfth century. Previous Orcadian earls had extended influence into Ross, and it may well have been through Hvarfl«´√∞, and the claims to the earldom that she passed to their children, that drew Haraldr into conflict with the Scots.Oram (2011) pp. 158-159; Crawford (2004a). Howden's account of events reveals that Haraldr and his family gained control of Moray early in 1196,Oram (2011) p. 158; Crawford (2004b) p. 31; Anderson (1908) p. 316 (¬ß 1196); Stubbs 1871 p. 10; Oliver (1860) pp. 37-38; Riley 1853 p. 392. and charter evidence suggests that William and royal forces were in the north that summer.Oram (2011) p. 158; Topping (1983) pp. 112, 117. Although the Chronicle of Melrose appears to indicate that Hvarfl«´√∞ and Haraldr's eldest son was defeated in 1197,Oram (2011) p. 158; Anderson (1922) pp. 347-348. it is possible that this event dates to 1196 instead and relates to William's aforesaid northern campaign.Oram (2011) p. 158. Fordun's account records that William successfully asserted royal power in the northern regions;Crawford (2004b) p. 31; Crawford or Hall (1971) p. 76, 76 n. 2; Skene (1872) p. 270 (¬ß 22). and Howden's account species that the king stripped Haraldr of his lordship in Caithness, and handed it over to Haraldr Eir√≠ksson, a claimant to the Orcadian earldom.Crawford or Hall (1971) pp. 76-77, 77 n. 1; Anderson (1908) pp. 316-317 (¬ß 1196); Stubbs 1871 p. 10; Oliver (1860) pp. 38-40; Riley 1853 p. 392. At some point after this, Howden's account reveals that Haraldr overcame and killed Haraldr Eir√≠ksson,Crawford (2004b) pp. 31, 41 n. 59; Crawford or Hall (1971) p. 77; Anderson (1908) pp. 316-317 (¬ß 1196); Stubbs 1871 p. 11; Oliver (1860) p. 41; Riley 1853 p. 393. and the Icelandic Annals specifically date the latter's fall to 1198.Crawford (2004b) p. 41 n. 59; Crawford or Hall (1971) p. 77; Anderson (1922) p. 350; Storm (1977) p. 121. Hedin Cross, a Manx runestone. The power of the kings of the Isles laid in their armed galley-fleets. It may have been at this point where R«´gnvaldr entered into the fray. Orkneyinga saga states that, once William learned that Haraldr had taken control of Caithness, R«´gnvaldr was tasked by the king to intervene on the Scots' behalf. Having received the king's message, the saga records that R«´gnvaldr duly gathered an armed host from the Isles, Kintyre, and Ireland, and went forth into Caithness and subdued the region.Somerville; McDonald (2010) pp. 481‚Äì482 (¬ß 110); McDonald (2007) p. 108; Williams (2007) pp. 146‚Äì148; Crawford (2004a); Crawford (2004b) p. 31; Sellar (2000) pp. 196‚Äì197; Crawford or Hall (1971) pp. 77, 79; Vigfusson (1887) p. 225; Anderson; Hjaltalin; Goudie (1873) pp. 195‚Äì196. Howden's account appears to confirm R«´gnvaldr's participation in the region, albeit under slightly different circumstances, as it states that Haraldr approached the king and attempted to purchase the earldom. William, however, refused the offer, after which Howden's version of events relates that \\"Reginaldus\\", the son of a Manx king, succeeded in purchasing the earldom.McDonald (2007) pp. 110‚Äì112; Williams (2007) p. 147; Crawford (2004a); Sellar (2000) pp. 196‚Äì197; Barrow (1992) p. 83 n. 65; Barrow (1971) pp. 16, 25 n. 74; Crawford or Hall (1971) pp. 77‚Äì78; Anderson 1908 pp. 316‚Äì318; Stubbs 1871 pp. 11-12; Oliver (1860) pp. 37-38; Riley 1853 p. 393. Although R«´gnvaldr was likely the sea-king who assisted the Scots against Haraldr, there is evidence suggesting that it may have been Ragnall instead.McDonald (2007) p. 110; Sellar (2000) pp. 196‚Äì197. For example, the saga makes the erroneous statement that R«´gnvaldr was descended from Ingibj«´rg P√°lsd√≥ttir,McDonald (2007) p. 72; Williams (2007) pp. 146‚Äì147, 147 n. 39; Sellar (2000) pp. 196‚Äì197; Anderson (1922) p. 350 n. 2; Vigfusson (1887) p. 225; Anderson; Hjaltalin; Goudie (1873) p. 195. a woman who was much more likely to have been Ragnall's grandmother than R«´gnvaldr's.Sellar (2000) pp. 196‚Äì198. The saga also notes that R«´gnvaldr's military force was partly gathered from Kintyre,Somerville; McDonald (2010) pp. 481‚Äì482 (¬ß 110); Williams (2007) pp. 146‚Äì148; Vigfusson (1887) p. 225; Anderson; Hjaltalin; Goudie (1873) pp. 195‚Äì196, 195‚Äì196 n. 39. which may be more likely of Ragnall than R«´gnvaldr, since Ragnall is known to have specifically styled himself dominus Ergile et Kyntyre. Also, transcriptions and translations of Howden's account of the episode have generally stated that \\"Reginaldus\\" was a son of Somairle.Beuermann (2008); McDonald (2007) p. 110; Barrow (1971) p. 25 n. 74. A recent reanalysis of the main extant version of Howden's chronicle has shown, however, that this particular part of the text originally read in Latin Reginaldus filius rex de Man, and was later altered to include Somairle's name above the last three words. Since the source of the original manuscript probably read in Latin Reginaldus filius Godredi, the sea- king in question appears to have been R«´gnvaldr rather than Ragnall. Whether Ragnall or R«´gnvaldr, William's act of using a grandson of √ìl√°fr in Caithness may have been an example of the king playing one member of the jarlsaetten against another.McDonald (2007) p. 111; Williams (2007) p. 147; Crawford (2004b) p. 31; Crawford or Hall (1971) pp. 78‚Äì79. The jarlsaetten were people who possessed a claim to an earldom, in accordance with Norse custom, by right of their descent from previous earls. There are earlier instances of such claimants requesting Scottish kings for what they considered their birthright,Crawford (2004b) p. 41 n. 62. and William certainly did this when he granted Caithness to Haraldr Eir√≠ksson, a grandson of R«´gnvaldr Kali Kolsson, Earl of Orkney.Crawford or Hall (1971) pp. 78‚Äì79. If Ragnall was indeed a descendant of Ingibj«´rg, a daughter of P√°ll H√°konarson, Earl of Orkney (died 1137), he was directly descended from previous Scandinavian earls. Whereas √ìl√°fr's marriage to Ingibj«´rg may have meant that R«´gnvaldr was regarded as a member of the jarlsaetten as well, and a cousin to Haraldr himself.McDonald (2012); McDonald (2007) p. 111. =Scandinavian sojourn= There is another instance where an historical source mentions a man who could refer to either Ragnall or R«´gnvaldr. The early thirteenth-century B«´glunga s«´gur indicates at one point that men of two Norwegian factions decided to launch a raiding expedition into the Isles. One particular version of the sagas states that R«´gnvaldr (styled \\"King of Mann and the Isles\\") and Gu√∞r√∏√∞r (styled \\"King on Mann\\") had not paid their taxes due to the Norwegian kings. In consequence, the saga records that the Isles were ravaged until the two travelled to Norway and reconciled themselves with Ingi B√°r√∞arson, King of Norway (died 1217), whereupon the two took their lands from Ingi as a l√©n or fief.Crawford (2014) pp. 72-73; Beuermann (2010) p. 106; McDonald (2007) p. 134; Johnsen (1969) p. 23; Fornmanna S√∂gur (1835) p. 194. The aforesaid kings of B«´glunga s«´gur most likely refer to R«´gnvaldr and his son, Gu√∞r√∏√∞r (died 1231),Crawford (2014) pp. 72-73; Beuermann (2011) p. 125; Beuermann (2010) p. 106 n. 19‚Äì20; McDonald (2007) p. 134; Johnsen (1969) p. 23. although it is not impossible that the king 'R«´gnvaldr' in this source may instead refer to Ragnall, and that the king 'Gu√∞r√∏√∞r' in it may actually refer to R«´gnvaldr himself, since the latter's father was named Gu√∞r√∏√∞r.McDonald (2007) p. 134 n. 61; Power (2005) p. 39; Cowan (1990) pp. 112, 114. Whatever the case, the events depicted in B«´glunga s«´gur appear to show that, in the wake of destructive Norwegian activity in the Isles, which may have been some sort of officially sanctioned punishment from Scandinavia, R«´gnvaldr and his son (or instead perhaps Ragnall and R«´gnvaldr) travelled to Norway where they rendered homage to the Norwegian king, and made compensation for unpaid taxes.McDonald (2007) p. 135; Power (2005) p. 39. =Muchdanach and Murcardus= According to Hebridean tradition preserved by the seventeenth-century Sleat History, at one point during Ragnall's tenure his followers fought and slew a certain \\"Muchdanach\\", ruler of Moidart and Ardnamurchan, and thereby acquired the latter's lands.Raven (2005) p. 58; Macphail (1914) pp. 12, 17. Muchdanach may be identical to a certain \\"Murcardus\\", a man described by the Chronicle of Mann as one whose \\"power and energy\\" were felt throughout the Kingdom of the Isles, and whose slaying is recorded in 1188, the year of R«´gnvaldr's assumption of the kingship.McDonald (2007) pp. 38, 169; Raven (2005) p. 58; Anderson (1922) p. 314; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 78‚Äì81. The chronicle's brief account of Murcardus appears to reveal that he was a member of the kingdom's elite, but whether his killing was connected to R«´gnvaldr's accession is unknown.McDonald (2007) p. 169. If Muchdanach and Murcardus were indeed the same individual, the Sleat History would appear to preserve the memory of meic Somairle intrusion into Garmoran, and the episode itself may be an example of feuding between the meic Somairle and Crovan dynasty.Raven (2005) p. 58. Ecclesiastical activities =The Diocese of Argyll= The extent of the Scottish Diocese of Argyll and the Norwegian Diocese of the Isles, and the location of several religious houses noted in the article. The ecclesiastical jurisdiction within the kingdom of Somairle's predecessors was the far-flung Diocese of the Isles. Little is known of its early history, although its origins may well lie with the U√≠ √çmair imperium.Woolf (2004) p. 171, 180. In the mid twelfth century, during the reign of Ragnall's maternal uncle Gu√∞r√∏√∞r √ìl√°fsson, King of the Isles (died 1187), the diocese came to be incorporated into the newly established Norwegian Archdiocese of Nidaros.Davey 2006b pp. 1618-1619; Woolf (2003) p. 176. In effect, the political reality of the Diocese of the Isles‚Äîits territorial borders and nominal subjection to Norway‚Äîappears to have mirrored that of the Kingdom of the Isles.Davey 2006a pp. 418-420; Davey 2006b pp. 1618-1619. Before the close of the twelfth century, however, evidence of a new ecclesiastical jurisdiction‚Äîthe Diocese of Argyll‚Äîbegins to emerge during ongoing contentions between the meic Somairle and the Crovan dynasty.MacDonald (2013) pp. 31-33. In the early 1190s, the Chronicle of Mann reveals that Cristinus, Bishop of the Isles, an Argyllman who was probably a meic Somairle candidate, was deposed and replaced by Michael (died 1203), a Manxman who appears to have been backed by R«´gnvaldr.Beuermann (2014) pp. 92‚Äì93; MacDonald (2013) pp. 31‚Äì33; McDonald (1997) p. 210; Watts (1994) pp. 111‚Äì114; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 114‚Äì115. Cristinus' tenure appears to have spanned at least two decades, during a sustained period of meic Somairle power in the Isles. His downfall, however, came about at about time of the Crovan dynasty's resurgence under R«´gnvaldr. The latter succeeded his father only years before, in 1187, and appears to have capitalised upon the infighting amongst the meic Somairle, and possibly even the downfall of Ragnall himself.MacDonald (2013) pp. 31‚Äì33. Although the first known Bishop of Argyll, Haraldr, is accorded a tenure during the first quarter of the thirteenth century, it is likely that there were earlier bishops unknown to surviving sources.MacDonald (2013) pp. 25-26. In fact, the diocese first appears on record in Liber Censuum, a Papal document dating to the last decade of the twelfth century;MacDonald (2013) p. 28; Woolf (2003) p. 175; McDonald (1997) p. 211; Fabre (1889) p. 232. and it is possible that Cristinus, or an unknown successor,MacDonald (2013) pp. 32-33. or perhaps even Haraldr himself, was the first dicocesan bishop.MacDonald (2013) p. 31; Woolf (2003) pp. 175-177. Whatever the case, Cristinus' tenure in the Isles may have witnessed an ecclesiastical reorientation, or shift of sorts, towards Argyll. Although the early diocesan succession of Argyll is uncertain,MacDonald (2013) p. 36. the jurisdiction itself appears to have lain outwith the domain of R«´gnvaldr's direct control, allowing the meic Somairle to readily act as religious patrons without his interference.McDonald (1997) pp. 211-213. Like the Kingdom of the Isles itself, the great geographic size of the Diocese of the Isles appears to have contributed to the alienation of outlying areas, and to its eventual disintegration.MacDonald (2013) p. 38; Woolf (2003) p. 180. In fact, there is reason to suspect that portions of the new diocese were likewise detached from the Scottish dioceses of Dunblane, Dunkeld,MacDonald (2013) pp. 24-25, 38-39; Woolf (2004) p. 106. and Moray.MacDonald (2013) pp. 24-25, 38-39. Although the Scottish Crown may have welcomed the formation of the new diocese, as it may have formed part of a plan to project Scottish royal authority into the region,MacDonald (2013) pp. 36‚Äì38; McDonald (1997) p. 212; Barrow (1992) p. 79. the meic Somairle rulers of the region were in fact hostile to the Scots, and the diocese's seat on LismoreMacDonald (2013) pp. 36-38.‚Äîalbeit first recorded in the early fourteenth centuryMacDonald (2013) pp. 41-42.‚Äîlay far outwith the Scottish king's sphere of influence. Whatever the case, the foundation of the Diocese of Argyll appears to have been a drawn-out and gradual process that was unlikely to have been the work of one particular manMacDonald (2013) p. 31.‚Äîsuch as Somerled,MacDonald (2013) pp. 30-31. Dubgall, or Ragnall himself.McDonald (1997) p. 212. Although the early diocese suffered from prolonged vacancies, as only two bishops are recorded to have occupied the see before the turn of the mid thirteenth century, over time it became firmly established in the region, allowing the meic Somairle to retain local control of ecclesiastical power and prestige.MacDonald (2013) p. 39. =Iona Abbey, Iona Nunnery, and St Oran's Chapel= Iona Abbey was probably founded by Ragnall and the meic Somairle in the thirteenth century. Little of the present site dates to the thirteenth century.Cross; Livingstone (1997) p. 843; Ritchie (1997) pp. 103‚Äì108. In the sixth century, exiled- Irishman Colum Cille (died 597) seated himself on Iona, from where he oversaw the foundation of numerous daughter-houses in the surrounding islands and mainland. Men of his own choosing, many from his own extended family, were appointed to administrate these dependent houses. In time, a lasting monastic network‚Äîan ecclesiastical familia‚Äîwas centred on the island, and led by his successors. During the ongoing Viking onslaught in the ninth century, the leadership of the familia relocated to Kells.Herbert (2004). In the twelfth century, Flaithbertach Ua Brolch√°in, Abbot of Derry (died 1175), the comarba (\\"successor\\") of Colum Cille, relocated from Kells to Derry.Power (2005) p. 29. In 1164, at a time when Somairle ruled the entire Kingdom of the Isles, the Annals of Ulster indicates that he attempted to reinstate the monastic familia on Iona under Flaithbertach's leadership.MacDonald (2013) p. 30; Power (2013) p. 64; Power (2005) pp. 28‚Äì29; Woolf (2004) p. 106; Thornton (2004); The Annals of Ulster (2012) ¬ß 1164.2; The Annals of Ulster (2008) ¬ß 1164.2; Hudson (1994) p. 159. Unfortunately for Somairle, the proposal was met with significant opposition, and with his death in the same year, his intentions of controlling the kingdom, diocese, as well as the leadership of the familia came to nothing.Beuermann (2012) p. 5; Power (2005) pp. 28‚Äì29; Woolf (2004) p. 106. St Oran's Chapel, the oldest intact building on Iona, may have been built by Ragnall, his father, or members of the Crovan dynasty. About forty years after Somairle's death, a Benedictine monastery was established on Iona. The monastery's foundation charter dates to December 1203,McDonald (1997) pp. 218‚Äì219; Munch; Goss (1874b) pp. 285‚Äì288. which suggests that Ragnall may have been responsible for its erection, as claimed by early modern tradition preserved in the eighteenth-century Book of Clanranald.Oram (2011) p. 168; Fisher (2005) p. 86; Power (2005) p. 29; McDonald (1997) pp. 218‚Äì219; Macbain; Kennedy (1894) pp. 156‚Äì157. Be that as it may, there is no hard evidence linking Ragnall to the house's foundation.Oram (2011) p. 168. Since the charter reveals that the monastery received substantial endowments from throughout the meic Somairle domain, the foundation appears to have been supported by other leading members the kindred,Fisher (2005) p. 86; Power (2005) p. 29; Munch; Goss (1874b) pp. 285‚Äì288. such as Dubgall himself (if he was still alive) or his son, Donnchad.Fisher (2005) p. 86. The charter placed the monastery under the protection of Pope Innocent III (died 1216), which secured its episcopal independence from the Diocese of the Isles.Beuermann (2012) p. 6; Power (2005) pp. 29‚Äì30; McDonald (1997) pp. 218‚Äì219; Watts (1994) p. 113 n. 7; Munch; Goss (1874b) pp. 285‚Äì288. However, the price for the privilege of Iona's papal protection appears to have been the adoption of the Benedictine Rule, and the supersession of the centuries-old institution of Colum Cille.Beuermann (2012) p. 6. The decision of the meic Somairle to establish the Benedictines on Iona completely contrasted the ecclesiastical actions of Somairle himself, and provoked a prompt and violent response from Colum Cille's familia. According to the Annals of Ulster, after Cellach, Abbot of Iona built the new monastery in 1204, a large force of Irishmen, led by the Bishops of Tyrone and Tirconell and the Abbots of Derry and Inishowen, made landfall on Iona and burnt the new buildings to the ground.Beuermann (2012) p. 9; Power (2005) p. 29; Annala Uladh ... (2003) ¬ß 1204.4; Annala Uladh ... (2005) ¬ß 1204.4; Hudson (1994) p. 159. The sentiments of the familia may well be preserved in a contemporary poem which portrays Colum Cille lamenting the violation of his rights, and cursing the meic Somairle.Hammond (2010) p. 83; M√°rkus (2007) pp. 98‚Äì99; Clancy (1997) p. 25. Unfortunately for the familia, the Benedictine presence on Iona was there to stay,Bannerman (1993) p. 46. and the old monastery of Colum Cille was nearly obliterated by the new monastery.Power (2005) p. 30. Somairle's attempt to revive Iona brought him into conflict with secular and ecclesiastical power in northern Ireland. If Ragnall was indeed responsible for the foundation of the Benedictine monastery about four decades afterwards, it may indicate that he was following in his father's footsteps, and asserting himself as a king in the Isles. Ruinous Iona Nunnery, probably founded by Ragnall in the early thirteenth century, is one of the best preserved mediaeval nunneries in the British Isles. The church's design has been mostly unaltered since its construction in the early thirteenth century, and gives an approximate impression of how the thirteenth- century abbey church would have looked.Ritchie (1997) pp. 108‚Äì110. Sometime before the end of the twelfth century,Power (2013) p. 64. or else early in the thirteenth century after the foundation of the Benedictine monastery, an Augustinian nunnery was established just south of the site.Power (2005) pp. 30‚Äì31. The Book of Clanranald reveals that Ragnall was traditionally regarded as its founder, and states his sister, Beth√≥c, was remembered as a prioress there.Fisher (2005) pp. 86‚Äì87; McDonald (1995a) pp. 208‚Äì209; Macbain; Kennedy (1894) pp. 156‚Äì157. Although this source's claim that the nunnery was originally a Benedictine foundation is erroneous,McDonald (1995a) p. 208; McDonald (1995a) pp. 208‚Äì209. its statement that Beth√≥c was a \\"religious woman\\" is corroborated by the seventeenth-century record of an inscribed stone on the island, said to have read in Gaelic \\"Behag nijn Sorle vic Ilvrid priorissa\\".Fisher (2005) pp. 86‚Äì87; McDonald (1995a) pp. 208‚Äì209; Sellar (1966) p. 129; Martin (1816) p. 263. Ragnall, therefore, may well have founded the nunnery, and his sister could well have been its first prioress.Fisher (2005) pp. 86 fig. 5.2, 86‚Äì87; Power (2005) pp. 30‚Äì31; Ritchie (1997) pp. 108‚Äì110; McDonald (1995a) pp. 208‚Äì209. Like the abbey itself, the remains of the nunnery reveal Irish influences, indicating that the Augustinian nunnery likely had Irish affiliations. In fact, apparent similarities between the layout of the abbey and that of the original church of the cathedral priory at Downpatrick suggests that the Benedictine foundation on Iona was related to the earlier introduction of the same order at Downpatrick by John de Courcy (died 1219?).Fisher (2005) pp. 86‚Äì87. The latter was an English adventurer who had conquered Ulster about twenty years previous, and had married Affrica (died in or after 1219), R«´gnvaldr's sister.Duffy (2004a); Duffy (2004b). The possible ecclesiastical connections between the Downpatrick and Iona, therefore, may partly exemplify the complex interrelationships within the Irish Sea region. Iona is popularly said to have been the traditional burial place of Scottish kings from the advent of the Alp√≠nid dynasty. Contemporary evidence for such claims, however, date only to about the twelfth- or thirteenth centuries.McDonald (1997) p. 206 n. 17; Hudson (1994) p. 159; Anderson (1949) p. 159. The so-called traditions, therefore, appear to have been constructed to advance Iona's prestige as a royal burial site, and may well have been instigated and encouraged by the meic Somairle.McDonald (1997) p. 206 n. 17; Hudson (1994) p. 159. Iona was certainly the burial place of Ragnall's later descendants, and leading members of West Highland nobility.McDonald (1997) p. 206 n. 17. The oldest intact building on the island is St Oran's Chapel.Power (2013) p. 65. Judging from certain Irish influences in its architecture, the chapel is thought to date to about the mid twelfth century. The building is known to have been used as a mortuary house by Ragnall's later descendants, and it is possible that either he or his father were responsible for its erection.Power (2005) p. 28; McDonald (1997) p. 246; Ritchie (1997) pp. 100‚Äì101. On the other hand, it is also possible that the chapel was constructed by the kings of the Crovan dynasty: either Gu√∞r√∏√∞r, who was buried on the island in 1188, or else Gu√∞r√∏√∞r's father (Ragnall's maternal-grandfather) √ìl√°fr.Power (2013) p. 66; Power (2005) p. 28. =Saddell Abbey= Ruinous Saddell Abbey, founded by either Ragnall or his father. A member of the meic Somairle,MacDonald (2013) p. 41; Oram (2011) p. 358. possibly Ragnall himself,Fisher (2005) p. 86; Stringer (2005) p. 58; Sellar (2000) p. 203; Brown (1969) pp. 130‚Äì133. or else his father, could have founded Saddell Abbey,Sellar (2000) p. 203; Brown (1969) pp. 130‚Äì133. a rather small Cistercian house, situated in the traditional heartland of the meic Somairle.Power (2005) p. 31. This, now ruinous monastery,McDonald (1995a) p. 209. apparently a daughter house of Mellifont Abbey,MacDonald (2013) pp. 41, 125; Oram (2011) p. 358; Stringer (2005) pp. 58; Brown (1969) pp. 130‚Äì131. is the only Cistercian house known to have been founded in the West Highlands. Surviving evidence from the monastery itself suggests that Ragnall was probably the founder. For example, when the monastery's charters were confirmed in 1393 by Pope Clement VII (died 1394), and in 1498 and 1508 by James IV, King of Scots (died 1513), the earliest grant produced by the house was that of Ragnall. Furthermore, the confirmations of 1393 and 1508 specifically state that Ragnall was indeed the founder, as does clan tradition preserved in the Book of Clanranald. However, evidence that Somairle was the founder may be preserved in a thirteenth-century French list of Cistercian houses which names a certain \\"Sconedale\\" under the year 1160.McDonald (1997) p. 220; Brown (1969) p. 132; McKerral (1952) pp. 116‚Äì117; Macphail; Dickson (1934) pp. 146‚Äì149; Anderson (1922) p. 247; Paul 1882 p. 678 (¬ß3170); Birch (1870) p. 361; H3/30/1 (n.d.). One possibility is that, whilst Somairle may well have begun the planning of a Cistercian house at Saddell, it was actually Ragnall who provided it with its first endowments.Brown (1969) p. 132. Somairle's attempt to relocate Colum Cille's familia to Iona, however, was undertaken during an era when Cistercians were already established in Ireland and the Isles,Oram (2011) p. 358; McDonald (1997) p. 221; McDonald (1995a) pp. 210‚Äì213. which may be evidence that Somairle was something of an \\"ecclesiastical traditionalist\\"Beuermann (2012) p. 2. who found newer reformed orders of continental Christianity unpalatable. Whatever the case, the ecclesiastical activities of his immediate descendants, especially the foundations and endowments of Ragnall himself, reveal that the meic Somairle were not averse to such continental orders. During his career, Somairle waged war upon the Scots and perished in an invasion of Scotland proper, which could suggest that Ragnall's ecclesiastical activities were partly undertaken to improve relations with the King of Scots.McDonald (1995a) p. 216. Additionally, in an age when monasteries were often built by rulers as status symbols of their wealth and power, the foundations and endowments of Ragnall may have been undertaken as a means to portray himself as an up-to-date ruler.McDonald (1995a) pp. 215‚Äì216. Death Paisley Abbey. Ragnall's grant to the priory (later abbey) of Paisley may be evidence of an alliance with the kindred who defeated his father. Ragnall may well have ended his days at the monastery. The year and circumstances of Ragnall's death are uncertain, as surviving contemporary sources failed to mark his demise.McDonald (1997) p. 79. According to clan tradition preserved in the Book of Clanranald, Ragnall may have died in 1207.Sellar (2000) p. 196; McDonald (1997) p. 78; Macbain; Kennedy (1894) p. 157. However, no corroborating evidence supports this date, and there is reason to believe that dates in this source are unreliable.Sellar (2000) p. 196, 196 n. 41. In fact, this source misplaces Somairle's death by sixteen years, which may indicate that Ragnall himself died some sixteen years earlier (in 1191). If this date is correct then Ragnall's death may be related to his defeat suffered at the hands of his brother.Sellar (2000) p. 196; McDonald (1997) pp. 78‚Äì79; Duncan; Brown (1957) p. 198 n. 5. However, the Chronicle of Mann, which records the 1192 conflict between Ragnall and √Åengus, gives no hint of Ragnall's demise in its account. Another possibility is that Ragnall may have been slain sometime around 1209 and 1210, during yet more internal conflict amongst the meic Somairle.McDonald (1997) p. 79; Cowan (1990) pp. 112, 114. A reanalysis of the Book of Clanranald has shown that, instead of 1207, this source may actually date Ragnall's demise to 1227. However, this date may well be too late for man who was an adult by 1164.Sellar (2000) p. 196, 196 n. 41; McDonald (1997) p. 79. Ragnall's grant to Paisley may leave clues to his fate. The similarity between this charter and another granted to the priory by his son, Domnall, may be evidence that the documents were drawn up at about the same time.Sellar (2000) pp. 196, 200; McDonald (1997) p. 74 n. 19; Duncan; Brown (1957) p. 198 n. 8. If so, Ragnall's charter may be evidence that he survived his defeat at the hands of √Åengus,Sellar (2000) p. 196. and the two charters may indicate that Ragnall was nearing the end of his life.McDonald (1997) p. 74 n. 19; Duncan; Brown (1957) p. 198 n. 8. Ragnall's grant may also indicate that he entered into a confraternity with the monks at Paisley. If the charter was indeed granted near the end of his life, it is also possible that Ragnall ended his days there. Since the priory was one of the religious houses founded by the meic Somairle, his possible retirement there may partly explain why Ragnall disappears from record after 1192. Family and legacy The seal of Ragnall's grandson, √Åengus mac Domnaill, Lord of Islay (died ). The name of Ragnall's wife, \\"Fonia\\", as recorded in their grant to the priory of Paisley, may be an attempt to represent the Gaelic name Findguala in Latin. According to late Hebridean tradition, preserved in the garbled Sleat History, Ragnall was married to \\"MacRandel's daughter, or, as some say, to a sister of Thomas Randel, Earl of Murray\\".Sellar (2000) p. 200; Macphail (1914) p. 13. This tradition cannot be correct due to its chronology, since Thomas Randolph, the first Earl of Moray, and his like-named son and successor, both died in 1332.Duncan (2004b). One possibility, however, is that the tradition may instead refer to an earlier earl‚ÄîUilleam mac Donnchada (died 1151‚Äì1154). If so, Ragnall's son, Domnall, may have been named after Uilleam's son, Domnall (died 1187). The latter was a leading member of the meic Uilleim, a kindred who were in open conflict against the Scottish kings from the late twelfth- to early thirteenth centuries.Scott (2005); Sellar (2000) p. 200. Ragnall is known to have left two sons: Ruaidr√≠ (died 1247?) and Domnall.Oram (2011) p. xvii; Fisher (2005) pp. 85, 86 fig. 5.2; Sellar (2000) pp. 194 tab. ii, 195. Domnall's line, the meic Domnaill (or Clann Domnaill), went on to produce the powerful Lords of the Isles who dominated the entire Hebrides and expansive mainland-territories from the first half of the fourteenth- to the late fifteenth centuries.Munro; Munro (2004). Ruaidr√≠ founded the meic Ruaidr√≠ (or Clann Ruaidr√≠), a more obscure kindred who were seated in Garmoran.McDonald (2004) p. 181. Ruaidr√≠ seems to have been the senior of Ragnall's sons, and is first recorded by name in 1214.Woolf (2007) p. 80. Four years previous, √Åengus and his sons are recorded by the Chronicle of Mann to have been slain on Skye.Woolf (2007) p. 80; Sellar (2000) p. 195, 195 n. 34; Anderson (1922) p. 387; Munch; Goss (1874b) pp. 82‚Äì83. This particular record could be evidence that √Åengus had succeeded Ragnall, after which the latter's sons extinguished √Åengus's line, and Ruaidr√≠ assumed control of the meic Somairle succession. Part of the meic Domnaill pedigree on folio 1v of National Library of Scotland Advocates MS 72.1.1 (also known as MS 1467). The excerpt shows the names of Ragnall's son Domnall (top), Ragnall himself (middle), and Ragnall's father (bottom).Black; Black (n.d.). It is very likely that either Ragnall or Ruaidr√≠ had daughters who married R«´gnvaldr and his younger half-brother, √ìl√°fr Gu√∞r√∏√∞arson (died 1237).Oram (2013); McDonald (2007) pp. 116‚Äì117, 152; Woolf (2007) p. 81; Raven (2005) pp. 57‚Äì58; Woolf (2004) p. 107; Woolf (2003) p. 178. The chronicle states that R«´gnvaldr had √ìl√°fr marry \\"Lauon\\", the daughter of a certain nobleman from Kintyre, who was also the sister of his own (unnamed) wife.Oram (2013); McDonald (2007) pp. 116‚Äì117; Woolf (2007) pp. 81‚Äì82; Anderson (1922) pp. 256‚Äì260. The precise identification of this father- in-law is uncertain,Oram (2013). although historical sources concerning the contemporary meic Somairle link this kindred with Kintyre more than any other region,Woolf (2007) p. 81. and both Ragnall and Ruaidr√≠ were contemporaneously styled \\"Lord of Kintyre\\".Oram (2013); McDonald (2007) pp. 116‚Äì117. It is possible that the first marriage took place sometime before 1210, perhaps not long after 1200, considering the age of R«´gnvaldr's son, Gu√∞r√∏√∞r.Oram (2013) These unions appear to have been orchestrated to patch up relations between the meic Somairle and the Crovan dynasty, rival kindreds who had bitterly contested the kingship of the Isles for about sixty years. In fact, it is possible that R«´gnvaldr's kingship was formally recognised by Ruaidr√≠, the leading meic Somairle dynast, who thereby established himself as a leading magnate within a reunified Kingdom of the Isles.Oram (2013); Woolf (2007) p. 81. Ragnall's name as it appears on folio 62v of Bodleian Library MS Rawlinson B 489 (the Annals of Ulster). The particular annal-entry in question concerns military actions conducted by unnamed sons of Ragnall in 1212.Annala Uladh ... (2005) ¬ß 1212.4; Annala Uladh ... (2003) ¬ß 1212.4. Ragnall is chiefly remembered in early modern Hebridean tradition as the genealogical link between Somairle and Domnall later's descendants. Unsupported claims made by the Book of Clanranald present Ragnall as \\"the most distinguished of the Gall or Gaedhil for prosperity, sway of generosity, and feats of arms\\", and report that he \\"received a cross from Jerusalem\\".Sellar (2000) p. 196; McDonald (1997) pp. 77‚Äì78; Macbain; Kennedy (1894) pp. 156‚Äì157. The latter statement may imply that Ragnall undertook (or planned to undertake) a pilgrimage or crusade. Although Ragnall's involvement in such an enterprise is not impossible, the claim is uncorroborated by contemporary sources.McDonald (1997) pp. 77‚Äì78. The mid sixteenth-century description of the Hebrides and the Islands of the Clyde authored by Donald Monro (died in or after 1575) reveals that Ragnall's reign was still remembered in the Isles during the sixteenth century. In this account, Monro credited Ragnall with establishing the law code administered by leading Hebrideans hundreds of years after his floruit.Coira (2012) p. 57; Sellar (2000) pp. 195‚Äì196.

Originally from Scotland, he came to Auckland in 1863. He set up his own ironmongery in New Plymouth, then Wanganui, and he finally settled in Wellington. In the latter city, he was mayor for one term. He then represented Wellington in Parliament for a total of eleven years. For the last two years of his life, he was appointed to the New Zealand Legislative Council. Early life Duthie was born on 28 February 1841 in Kintore, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. He was educated at the Aberdeen Grammar School. In that city, he undertook an apprenticeship with Glegg and Thompson, an ironmongery. After his training, Duthie was for some years travelling in Scotland and Ireland for a Sheffield firm. Professional life in New Zealand John Duthie's ironmonger shop in Whanganui in the 1870s Brass band marching in Willis Street, Wellington, 1951, with the John Duthie shop in the third building from right Duthie arrived in Auckland, New Zealand, on 16 November 1863 on the Helvellyn. For some time he acted as traveller for Cruickshank, Smart and Co., ironmongers. About 1866 Dutbie moved to New Plymouth and started in business; about two years later extending the operations to Wanganui, where he opened a branch and conducted a growing trade for many years. He was for many years in partnership with Charles Brown in New Plymouth. In 1879 he came to Wellington, and started the business that developed into John Duthie and Co. Limited. Until 1887 or 1888, Duthie retained an interest in the Wanganui business, which he then sold to his partner, James Thain. He was the director of several city companies, and was in business with James Gear in the 1880s, where he was a director, and for two years served as the chairman of directors. He was at one time president of the Wellington Chamber of Commerce, and was president of the Caledonian Society for some years. Duthie was one of the founding directors of The Dominion newspaper and was chairman of the newspaper's board from 1912 until his death in 1915. That newspaper merged in 2002 with the other Wellington daily, The Evening Post, to form The Dominion Post. Political career While a resident of Wanganui, he was at one time chairman of the Harbour Board. In Wellington he was a member of the Wellington Harbour Board for many years and was chairman of that body in 1887‚Äì1888. In 1889, he was elected Mayor of Wellington without opposition. He held the position for one year. John Duthie caricature, 1896 Duthie, a conservative politician who was never sympathetic to the ideas of the Liberal Party, was first elected to the three-member electorate of City of Wellington in the 1890 general election, when he came second, with 50 votes behind George Fisher, but 300 votes ahead of Kennedy Macdonald. He served until the end of the term of the 11th New Zealand Parliament in 1893. At the 1893 general election, he was again elected for Wellington, coming third alongside Francis Bell (the later Prime Minister) and Robert Stout (the former Prime Minister), but defeating the incumbent Macdonald. Duthie retired at the end of the term of the 12th New Zealand Parliament in 1896 and did not stand in the 1896 general election. The resignation of Stout triggered the 9 March 1898 City of Wellington by- election. The election was contested by Duthie and Richard Clement Kirk, with the former being successful. Duthie retired at the end of the term of the 13th New Zealand Parliament in 1899 and did not stand in the 1899 general election. Duthie stood once more in the three-member Wellington electorate in the 1902 general election and came second, and was thus returned alongside John Aitken and George Fisher. He served until the end of the term of the 15th New Zealand Parliament in 1905. The Wellington electorate was abolished in 1905 and replaced by three single-member electorates. Duthie chose to contest the Wellington North electorate and contested it against Charles Hayward Izard and George Dickson Macfarlane. Izard was successful, with Duthie coming second, and the latter's parliamentary career had thus come to an end. Duthie was remembered as one of the sternest critics of the Liberal Government under Richard Seddon. Duthie had a very direct manner. He believed strongly that he was right, and that everybody who disagreed with him was wrong. Under William Massey's Reform Government, Duthie was appointed to the Legislative Council on 26 June 1913 and served until his death. Balgownie House The Duthie family lived in Wellington until their new home, Balgownie, was completed in 1903 in the Lower Hutt suburb of Naenae. The house, built entirely from native timbers, was at the time regarded as one of the finest in the Wellington region. It had its own electricity generation plant on the property and is believed to be the first house in the region that had electricity. The house is these days a private residence. Both the house and the generator building are registered with Heritage New Zealand as Category II heritage structures. The house is registered under number 4140, and the generator building under number 4141. Family and death Duthie married Mary Anne Duthie (n√©e Mercer, born 3 December 1840). Three of their daughters died young: Laura (1 September 1875 ‚Äì 30 March 1876) was buried at Wanganui, while Isabella Miller (15 March 1867 ‚Äì 12 November 1896; wife of Thomas Miller) and Florence (27 January 1876 ‚Äì 21 December 1896) were both buried at Karori Cemetery. His wife died on 8 October 1911 and is buried at Karori Cemetery. Duthie died on 14 October 1915 at his residence Balgownie aged 74 years. He was buried at Karori Cemetery in plot number 85 F two days later, next to his wife. He was survived by one daughter and six sons. Mercer Street in central Wellington is named in honour of the mayoress. Duthie Street in Karori is named for him, although he never lived in Karori.

As the United States gained experience in amphibious operations, it was realized that some sort of mobile repair facility would be useful for repairing the damage that frequently occurred to smaller vessels such as LCVP's (Landing Craft Vehicle/Personnel). The Auxiliary Repair Light (ARL) ship was designed to meet this need, and the Achelous class was the only class to receive this designation. Description View from the conning tower of the USS Typhon (ARL-28) Achelous class vessels were based on the same hull as LST's (Landing Ship, Tank) which at the time were being produced in large numbers. This hull was thought to be ideal for a ship specializing in the repair of light craft, since it was not overly large and had a shallow draught which would enable it to maneuver into small harbors, rivers and inlets where it could service damaged boats and effect other repairs on location. The conversion from an LST to an Achelous class ARL was done mainly by converting the large interior tank deck into a number of different shops and storerooms. Two large cargo booms were added forward, and a large 60-ton A-frame boom added amidships. The wheelhouse/chart room deck was expanded, and a conning tower added. The first nine units of the class sealed the bow doors of the LST hull. The ship's company consisted of the usual LST crew of deck, engineering and communications departments but in addition it had a supply department, plus a repair department consisting of machinery and engine repair, carpentry, electronics repair, and hull repair divisions, giving a ship's complement of approximately 250 officers and men in total. After the first nine units were built, the later units had a revised armament as well as retaining the opening bow doors. Operational history During World War II, the Achelous class vessels worked mostly on repairing damaged landing craft, but many continued in service after the war, working again on landing craft during the Korean War and on river craft during the Vietnam War. In all, 39 Achelous class repair ships were built between 1943 and 1945. Ships in Class {class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" - valign=\\"bottom\\" !Hull no. !

Katz has worked with prosecutors on more than one dozen terrorism investigations, and many American officers in Iraq rely on her e-mails to, for example, brief troops on the designs for explosives that are passed around terrorist Web sites. With the SITE Institute, which she co-founded to monitor Islamic extremist websites and to expose terrorist front groups, Katz worked with federal investigators in terrorism cases.Cha, Ariana Eunjung.\\"From a Virtual Shadow, Messages of Terror\\", The Washington Post, page A01, October 2, 2004.

Katz also served as a consultant in a $1 trillion wrongful-death suit seeking to hold Saudi government and business interests accountable for the 9/11 attacks. In May 2003, Katz published an anonymous semi-autobiography entitled Terrorist Hunter: The Extraordinary Story of a Woman Who Went Undercover to Infiltrate the Radical Islamic Groups Operating in America. She appeared in disguise on the CBS newsmagazine, 60 Minutes, to promote her book using the pseudonym \\"Sarah\\", and wearing a wig and a fake nose,Marc Perelman,‚ÄòMuslim Charities Sue CBS, Investigator‚Äô, Forward, 13 June 2003 to protect herself and her family from retaliation from groups that she said were linked to al-Qaeda, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and Hezbollah. In the book she tries to reveal what she sees as the gravity and extent of the presence of Islamic fundamentalism in America, and that government agencies still do not work together as one to fight terrorism, instead concealing information from each other, attempting to take over investigations, and even deliberately slowing down terrorism investigations. SITE's work was cited in The New York Times and the Washington Post about twice a month as of 2006. In January 2007, Al Jazeera reported that the National Association of Muslim American Women filed a formal complaint with the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, Criminal Section, and with the Executive Office for the United States Attorneys at the U.S. Department of Justice, alleging that as a result of misleading and false information provided to U.S. law enforcement agencies, the media, and various governmental bodies, various Jewish organizations and individuals including Katz had sought to create an environment in the U.S. that is hostile towards U.S. Muslims, resulting in the deprivation and violation of Muslim civil liberties and civil rights.\\"National Association of Muslim American Women files for Department of Justice investigation of Jewish Lobby ,\\" Al Jazeera, January 19, 2007. Retrieved 2010-03-23. In October 2007, it was revealed that Katz had discovered and issued to the Bush administration a copy of an Osama bin Laden video which had yet to be released by al-Qaeda. Katz issued the video via a private link to a SITE web page to White House counsel Fred F. Fielding and Joel Bagnal, deputy assistant to the President for Homeland Security. Within 20 minutes, computers registered to various parts of the Executive Branch began downloading the video, and within hours a transcript referencing SITE had appeared on Fox News. Katz had requested that the web page remain confidential, and has reported that dissemination of this information tipped off her Al-Qaeda supporters who had since eliminated the ability of SITE to gather such information. =Controversies= In July 2003 two of the groups she discussed in her book and on television (the Heritage Education Trust and the Safa Trust) sued her and revealed her name and identity. The number of lawsuits she was named in rose to three, all in connection with her work helping the government investigate Islamic charities in northern Virginia. In two of the suits, targets of the investigation said they were defamed in the 60 Minutes television broadcast. Katz said she has been the victim of a smear campaign, and attempts to intimidate her, adding: > As they were never able to challenge the accuracy of my research, and as > they were upset by the ramifications of it in terms of arrests, indictments, > and raids, a few Muslim activist organizations have on occasion tried to > portray me as a Muslim-basher.

Critics of Katz claim she is giving terrorists a larger platform than they would otherwise have, and is too eager to find plots where they don't exist. Some people also do not think a private group with limited resources can do as good a job as government agencies can.

Info  Dara Mohammed, who turns 22 on 19 June, raised quite a few eyebrows when he earned a place in Iraq's FIFA Confederations Cup squad in preference to many of the country's seasoned full-backs. Yet despite his youth, few question that he has the potential to develop into one of the nation's most dependable defenders. Born in 1987 in Kirkuk in the north-east of Iraq, the Kurdish player has spent his relatively short career with two regional clubs. After spending a couple of seasons with Sulaymaniyah FC, where he announced his emergence as a promising star, he quickly earned a lucrative contract with Iraqi giants Erbil FC in 2007. His stint with Erbil FC proved short, but it was impressive nonetheless as he won his first national league title in his first and only season with the club. The next season saw him come full circle, returning to Sulaymaniyah FC, with whom he has remained until this day. Having thrived at left-back position on the domestic scene, Mohammed was charged with the task of shoring up Iraq's defence during the qualifying campaign for the Men's Olympic Football Tournament at Beijing 2008. His reward for some solid showings at that level was a call-up to the Iraqi senior team for 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa qualifier against Pakistan, and now a place at the Festival of Champions in South Africa. Personal life On 17 March 2018, it was reported that Dara is suffering from cancer.

In the first phase, the road will be widened to 100 ft (4 lanes) with center median at a cost of 980 million. History Thirumullaivasal is one of the many temple towns in the state which is named after the grooves, clusters or forests dominated by a particular variety of a tree or shrub and the same variety of tree or shrub sheltering the presiding deity. The region is believed to have been covered with Chamapaka forest and hence called Chamapakavanam. In ancient times, the forest surrounding Thirumullaivoyal was occupied by two Kurumbars named Vanan and Onan. King Thondaiman who was the emperor there tried to end the atrocities by waging a war against them. En route to the war-field, his elephant's leg was surrounded by mullai creepers. The king, while cutting those climbers,found blood oozing out of it and later found that it was the Siva linga from which the blood was oozing. The king was deeply worried; but, according to the Temple History, the Lord appeared before him and pacified the king saying, 'In spite of the blood I am Pure' -- hence the name Masilamani. The king duly defeated the kurumbas and brought with him the two _white- erukku_ pillars from their palace and used them while building the temple for Masilmaninathar. It is believed that the Lord supported him in destroying the Kurumbas by sending the Nandi. The unique feature of the temple is the Nandi facing eastward against Lord Shiva. Also this is one of the few temples where the positions of the Lords are interchanged. This is believed to be because of the urgency in providing darshan to the local king. Later history In recent times, a majority of the portion of land was acquired by Lala Family and was given to the farmers of the village to help the poor villagers and to keep the land fertile. There was a huge growth in the population of this area, as the people living in the cities are migrating towards the place. Temples built by ancient kings Thirumullaivoyal has rich heritage Temples.

Etymology and history  The name kamado is the Japanese word for \\"stove\\" or \\"cooking range\\". It means a \\"place for the cauldron\\". A movable kamado called \\"mushikamado\\" came to the attention of Americans after World War II. It is now found in the US as a Kamado-style cooker or barbecue grill. The mushikamado is a round clay pot with a removable domed clay lid and is typically found in Southern Japan. Since Japanese kamado were introduced from Korea, the word kamado itself is rooted in the Korean word gama (), which means a buttumak (hearth). Some kamados have dampers and draft doors for better heat control. The kanji character for kamado is . The kanji character may be the best name to use when searching for information about traditional unmovable kamados. Elsewhere, the word kamado has become a generic term for ceramic or unfired-clay cookstoves.  Mushikamado  = Construction = Mushikamado are made from a variety of materials including high fire ceramics, refractory materials, double wall insulated steel, traditional terra cotta, or a mix of Portland cement and crushed lava. Outer surfaces vary from a high gloss ceramic glaze, paint, a textured stucco-like surface or ceramic tiles. Modern ceramic and refractory materials decrease cracking ‚Äì a common fault in the original design, and still a factor in Portland cement designs. In addition to the outer ceramic shell, a ceramic or stainless steel bowl inside the unit holds charcoal. One or more grids are suspended over the fire to provide the cooking surface(s) for food. A draft opening in the lower side of the unit provides air to the fuel, as well as a controllable vent in the top of the dome lid for air to exit the cooker. Temperature is controlled by adjusting these two vents, which in most Kamado-style cookers can be monitored through a hole in the lid. Digital temperature control devices can be installed using a small blower to regulate airflow. High-end kamados have layers of insulation that create low-airflow cooking conditions and are self-opening. = Fuel = Mushikamado grills are generally fueled by charcoal but may burn dry twigs, straw or wood. However, attempts have been made to fire them with gas, electricity, or pellets. One of the claims for ceramic construction is it does not affect flavor (no metallic taste) and, for the same reasoning, lump wood charcoal produces little ash and is preferred. Charcoal briquettes contain many additives that can contaminate the flavor. Lump wood charcoal can be manufactured in an environmentally sustainable manner using coppicing. = Uses = Mushikamado is designed to steam rice and it is used by Japanese families for ceremonial occasions. It is versatile and can be used for grilling and smoking. Flat-bread, such as pizza, can be cooked on a flat ceramic or stone tray (pizza stone). This is by virtue of the heat retention properties of the ceramic shell with temperatures up to 750 ¬∞F (400 ¬∞C). Precise control of airflow (and thus temperature) afforded by the vent system means Kamado-style cookers are much like wood-fired ovens and can be used to roast and bake. Kamados may have a rotisserie cradle for crisping the skin of birds and uniform browning.

Life David ben Judah was educated at Naples in the school of his father, Judah Messer Leon, author of Libnat ha-Sappir, and received at the age of eighteen his rabbinical diploma from German and French Talmudic authorities. Soon afterward he went to Padua, where he studied under Judah Minz, who granted him a new rabbinical diploma. After further studies in Florence, he returned to Naples in 1492, where he practised as a physician and taught in his father's academy. However, in 1495 the city fell to the French under Charles VIII, and he fled east to the Ottoman Empire to escape the violent pogroms that ensued, spending time in Istanbul before moving sometime between 1498 and 1504 to teach Torah in Salonica, at that time in a state of intellectual vibrancy due to the settlement there of many Sephardi exiles forced to leave after the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492, Sicily in 1493, and Portugal in 1496. It was while he was at Salonica that he completed his most major work, the Ein ha-Kore (Eye of the Reader), a sympathetic commentary defending Maimonides' Guide for the Perplexed, criticizing the commentary of Isaac Abravanel. The reputation of the book spread, and he was called to the rabbinate of Avlona in 1510 at a salary of 70 florins a year. The community possessed three congregations of various nationalities, and Leon officiated successively in the three synagogues on every third Saturday. In the very first year of his rabbinate dissensions on account of a ritual question arose which caused the separation of the Portuguese and Catalan Jews from the Castilians. Toward the end of his second year in Avlona a quarrel broke out among the Sephardim and the Portuguese. Leon, who sided with the Portuguese, had for antagonists Abraham ·∏§arbon and Abraham de Collier. Excommunications were launched by both parties even on the Day of Atonement, before the Sephardim finally relented. Some time later R. David returned to Salonica, where he died whilst still writing his last book. Works Leon was a prolific writer, and produced works in many branches of secular science, as well as on distinctively Jewish subjects. With the exception of two, all remained unpublished. Most of them are no longer extant, and are known only from quotations. Leon preferred to clothe his philosophy in the garb of the Kabbalah, in which he was an adept; but he was too much of a philosopher to become involved in the abysses of mysticism. In his kabbalistic work Magen David, still extant in manuscript, he freely quotes the Greek and the Arabic philosophers. For him Plato was the greatest kabbalist. This philosopher, Leon claimed, lived at the time of the prophet Jeremiah, who was his teacher. Leon wrote also the following works: *Abir Ya'a·∏≥ob, on medicine and other sciences; *Sefer ha-Derashot, sermons arranged in the order of the sections of the Torah (according to Neubauer, it is identical with the Tif'eret Adam quoted in Leon's commentary on Lamentations); *Menorat ha-Zahab, also extant in manuscript, probably a haggadic commentary on Lamentations; * Ein ha-Kore, a commentary on the Moreh Nebukim, criticizing the commentary of Isaac Abravanel; *Miktam le-Dawid, a kabbalistic work mentioned in the Ein ha-Kore; *Sod ha-Gemul, in which he shows that the Israelites, unlike other nations, are not under a special sign of the zodiac; *refutations of Albo's criticisms of Aristotle; *Sheba·∏• ha-Nashim, still extant in manuscript (according to Steinschneider, \\"Hebr. Bibl.\\" xix.83, identical with the commentary on ); *Tehillah le-Dawid (published by the author's grandson Aaron le-Bet David, Constantinople, 1577), in three parts: (1) on the excellence of the Law; (2) on the elements of faith, which latter is superior to speculative reasoning; (3) on the principles of God, the divine attributes, providence, free will, etc.; *a halakic decision on the ritual question which caused the division of the various congregations of Avlona, published by S. Bernfeld, under the title Kebod ·∏§akamim, Berlin, 1899 (Me·∏≥i·∫ìe Nirdamim). Leon was considered as a high Talmudic authority, and was consulted on halakhic questions. Two of his decisions have been preserved.Elijah Mizrachi, Responsa, No. 47; Neubauer, \\"Cat. Bodl. Hebr. MSS.\\" No. 834 In one of his works Leon mentions a commentary of his own on Moses of Coucy's Sefer Mitzvot Gadol (\\"Semag\\"). Parma MS. de Rossi No. 1395\\"Cat. Perreau,\\" No. 19 contains a scientific treatise by Leon. In the introduction to this treatise Leon says that he wrote many poems in Hebrew and in the \\"Christian language,\\" meaning thereby Latin or Italian. Shabbethai Bass, without indicating any source, gives, in his Sifte Yeshenim, the following titles of works attributed to Leon: Beit David; Kisse David; Nefesh David; ·∏≤ol Adonai ba-Koa·∏•; and Na·∏•al Adanim.

The neighbouring villages are Bedfield, Ashfield cum Thorpe, Kenton and Bedingfield. The nearest primary school is in Bedfield. There are secondary schools in Framlingham, Debenham and Woodbridge. In 2011, Monk Soham had a population of 156. In the early 1870s, Monk Soham was described as a parish, with a village, in Hoxne district, Suffolk; four and a quarter miles WNW of Framlingham r. station. Post town, Wickham-Market. Acres, 1,569. Real property, ¬£3,153. Pop., 442. Houses, 86. The property is subdivided. The living is a rectory in the diocese of Norwich. Value, ¬£530. There are a parochial school, and charities ¬£80. History Monk Soham directly means \\"monks\\" meadow by a \\"lake\\". The monks belonged to the abbey at Bury, and were given the land in the late 10th century by Alfed, Bishop of East Anglia. The lake no longer exists, however, it is believed to have reclined north of the back road which now runs from Earl Soham towards Ashfield-cum-Thorpe. In the Doomsday Book of 1086, \\"Soham\\" was described as a village which consisted of both Monk and Earl Soham. Monk Soham was considered to be in the Bishop's Hundred along with Hoxne,Open Domesday Online: Monk Soham while Earl Soham was considered to be in a different hundred for judicial purposes. This suggests that both villages have since been separated, as on twenty-first century maps they have distinguished boundaries. The Doomsday book also states Monk Soham had fifteen acres of meadow and woodland for thirty pigs and eighty-one goats in the 11th century; this suggests that the rural town was focused on farming and agriculture and carried on this sector of work for many centuries, and in 1868 the parish was recorded as \\"wholly agricultural\\". Most of the woods were cut down between 1500 and 1640 to make room for pasture. County records describe the village as consisting mainly of meadow with the farming of dairy cows, pigs, horses and poultry as well as growing a variety of crops. Following the 13th century reorganization of the hundreds, Monk Soham was in Hoxne Hundred. Monk Soham was described as having a small market on a Saturday and a charity school in 1813. In the mid-1800s, a village school was built for 85 pupils. Attendance averaged 82 by 1883, however, it fell to 42 in 1900 and after gradual decline, in 1947 the school was closed. In 1958 the Suffolk Parish History described Monk Soham as \\"a small dispersed settlement\\". This graph shows the population change for Monk Soham, Suffolk, as reported by the Census of the population from 1801 to 2011. Abbey House is a listed historical Victorian Rectory, set in an idyllic setting surrounded by ten acres of private garden and meadowland. The house lies hidden amongst the many magnificent old oak, beech and lime trees in the grounds. Nowadays, it is a B&B; which brands itself as a famous Victorian residence with very attractive grounds. Claude Morley, the English antiquary and entomologist who specialised in Hymenoptera and Diptera, lived in Monk Soham House from 1904 until his death in 1951. It is clear that the monks used to take part in the recreational sport of fishing as the fishponds they used can still be identified today although most have dried up. Demographics Occupation for inhabitants in Monk Soham according to 1831 census data Occupation for inhabitants in Monk Soham according to 2011 census data Census data for Monk Soham dates back to 1801. The earliest recorded population total at this time was 329. The highest number to be recorded by the census was in 1851 with a total population of 448. The population of this parish has been in decline since 1851, with the lowest recorded being in 2011 with a total population of 156, which is under half of the highest recorded figure. The main industry recorded for the village in 1831 was in agriculture, in particular, 57% of inhabitants were agricultural labourers. In the 2011 Census this figure had dropped to 0% and the most popular occupations with 24% of the people are the managers, directors and senior officials' jobs. The explanation for this is due to Britain's shift from primary sector jobs to secondary and finally tertiary. This will also explain why most of the other jobs are in the tertiary sector such as customer service occupations and caring, leisure and other service occupations. This century, many inhabitants commute to London, Ipswich, Norwich and Cambridge leaving few to work on the land. St Peter's Church A church has been recorded in Monk Soham since 1086, however, the earliest parts of the present building date from 1300. St Peter's Church has a notable Seven Sacrament font,Monk Soham at suffolkchurches.co.uk which is one of thirteen in Suffolk and one of forty in the UK, which is finely detailed. The panel facing east is for the Mass, and then; Baptism (NE), Ordination (N), Confirmation (NW), Last Rites (W), Matrimony (SW), Crucifixion (S) and Confession (SE). There is also a square embattled tower. Archdeacon Robert Groome was the rector of Monk Soham for forty-four years from 1845, and spent ¬£850 in 1860 on restoring St Peter's after the structure was in such bad condition. His friend and poet Edward Fitzgerald gave him four yew trees which were planted by the church gates. To remember the 2000 millennium, in the churchyard a further two more yew trees were planted in union with the Parish Council. Transport In 1904 the Mid-Suffolk Light Railway opened stations two miles away (3 km) at Kenton and Worlingworth, for goods traffic, and extended the service to passengers in 1908, which gave the villagers of Monk Soham a chance to travel. From then on, it was possible to catch a train to Haughley Junction and there onward to Ipswich and London. The line was never extended and was closed in July 1952. High Suffolk Community Transport is the bus operator services that provides several different routes through the small villages, however many of the routes are very irregular, and many of them only run one day a week or come every few hours. The nearest train station to Monk Soham is Wickham Market, which is away. An hourly bus service runs from Framlingham to Ipswich with every other one passing through Earl Soham. Hungers Green Hungers Green is an area of Common Land in the Parish of Monk Soham. It runs from south to north from School Lane in Monk Soham to the boundary, with Bedfield Parish in the north. Its area is just under 2 hectares. Due to Hungers Green being Common Land, it is distinguished as \\"Access Land\\" under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act (CRoW), passed in 2000. Details of access under the \\"Right to Roam\\" legislation are found on the Ramblers and Government Association websites. Adjacent to the Green is privately owned woods which is locally known as Flooks Wood, and contains a small pond. It is an example of the greens and commons that are very typical of the claylands of High Suffolk, however, many of these have become lost or fragmented to intensive agriculture or urban-style development. The greens and commons remaining are consequently significant historical landscape features and vital for wildlife, meaning Hungers Green is a popular site to visit when in the area. The grassland and adjacent woodland has high wildlife value from barn owls, to butterfly to grass snakes and swallows. Historically, the grass would have been used for hay and/or grazing of animals. Grazing rights for cows were given to two locals on Hungers Green but these have not been exercised for a number of years. Recently, a period of overgrazing has resulted in creeping thistle becoming problematic. Suffolk Wildlife offered advice on the long term care of the Green for wildlife in 2004. Subsequently, to ensure the welfare of Hungers Green, an environmental group has been established.

The river rises near Pardelup and meanders in a southerly direction until it flows through Denmark into Wilson Inlet (along with the Hay River). The traditional owners of the area are the Noongar people, who know the river as Kwoorabup, meaning the place of the Western brush wallaby (place we return to). The river was given its English name in December 1829 by naval ship's surgeon Thomas Braidwood Wilson after his mentor, naval surgeon Alexander Denmark, Physician of the Fleet, Resident Physician at the Royal Hospital Haslar, and past-Physician to the Mediterranean Fleet. Wilson found the river while exploring the area in company of the native Mokare, John Kent (officer in charge of the Commissariat at King George Sound), two convicts and Private William Gough of the 39th Regiment, while his ship the Governor Phillips was being repaired at King George Sound. A surveyor noted in 1833 that the local aborigines, the Noongar, called the river \\"Koorrabup\\" meaning \\"place of the black swan\\". The river flows through Denmark Pipehead Dam. The two tributaries of the river are Scotsdale Brook and Cleerillup Creek. The southern portion of the river was protected under a management plan of the Denmark Shire Council in 2011. The ceremonial site has been used by Noongar people for over 10,000 years as a place of dance, song, marriage preparation, initiation and food gathering. The area has high cultural significance due largely to its totemic significance and creation by the Wagyl in the Dreaming.  Salinity  Historically the Denmark River's water quality declined as a result of land clearing in the catchment area since European settlement. It is estimated that 40% of the river's upper catchment area was cleared and as a result salinity levels increased from 40 mg/L in the 1940s to a peak of 1520 mg/L in 1987 at the Mt Lindesay gauging station. In 2004 it was announced that salinity levels in the river were decreasing, believed to be the first major river in Australia that had shown a reversal in salinity trends, and that it is possible that the river could provide drinking quality water in the future. By 2012 average annual salinity levels had dropped to 470 mg/L, below World Health Organization guidelines for drinking water for the first time in nearly 40 years. The improved water quality means Denmark Dam has been returned as a drinking water source and back-up water supply for Denmark. The drop in salinity is mainly attributed to the revegetation of previously cleared farmland with Tasmanian blue gum plantations.

Rowe's father, who was a newspaper editor of the largest Bulgarian newspaper, Bulgarianised his name due to Bulgaria's communist government. He instilled in Rowe a love of cooking and passed down the traditions of the Ottoman cuisine. At the age of 19, she moved to London. Silvena cooked in the kitchen of the Notting Hill bookshop Books for Cooks, which led her to cook for Princess Michael of Kent, Ruby Wax and Tina Turner. She also met Malcolm Gluck and the two began to write a regular food column for The Guardian newspaper. In 2007, she was the food consultant on David Cronenberg‚Äôs 2007 film Eastern Promises. She has become a regular guest on the BBC's Saturday Kitchen and ITV's This Morning. In 2007, her book Feasts won the Glenfiddich Food and Drink Award. After her father's death she wanted to rediscover her heritage so she travelled through Turkey, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan tracing her Ottoman roots; this resulted in her cookbook Purple Citrus and Sweet Perfume. On 7 June 2011, her restaurant Quince opened at The May Fair Hotel in Mayfair, London.

The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. It is an active Anglican parish church in the diocese of Chester, the archdeaconry of Chester and the deanery of Wirral South. Its benefice is combined with that of St Michael, Little Neston. St Thomas' Church, Parkgate, is a chapel of ease in the parish. History The presence of a priest at Neston is recorded in the Domesday Book. The earliest written evidence of a church on the site dates from around 1170 when a church was founded by Ralph de Montalt, a baron of the court of the Earl of Chester. It is likely that an earlier church was on the site because when the floor was being relaid during the 19th century, fragments of pre-Conquest crosses were found. These were later shown to be \\"hiberno Norse\\" or Viking Age in origin. A further fragment was discovered in the church's belfry in the 1980s. These fragments are now mounted at the west end of the church. During the 18th century there was disagreement between some of the parishioners and the churchwardens when galleries were erected. The addition of the galleries caused damage to the fabric of the church and in 1871 an inspecting architect reported that the building was unsafe. Consequently, in 1874‚Äì75 the main body of the church was rebuilt by J. Francis Doyle, reusing some of the Norman material in Early English style. Architecture =Exterior= The church is built in sandstone. The roofs are of slate with a red tile ridge. The tower is the only old part of the church remaining. Richards describes it as \\"a rugged gargoyled pile of masonry with very little architectural refinement\\". The lower part probably includes some re-used Norman material. An additional storey was added to the tower in 1854. The body of the church consists of a six-bay nave with aisles, a two-bay chancel with a north vestry, and a south porch. The aisles are gabled and the nave has a clerestory. =Interior= The font dates from the 16th century; it is octagonal with quatrefoiled panels. This is the font in which Lady Hamilton was baptised as Emy Lyon on 12 May 1765. The only specifically designed memorial within the church is a carved stone in memory of a 14th-century priest. Some of the stained glass windows are designed by Edward Burne-Jones and made by Morris & Co.; others are by Kempe. Between the tower and the nave are elaborate wrought iron gates to the memory of Reginald Bushell who died in 1904. The three-manual organ was built in 1900 by Forster and Andrews. There is a ring of eight bells. Four of these are by Rudhall of Gloucester dated 1731; the other four are by Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry and are dated 1884. The parish registers begin in 1559 and record the baptism in the church in 1761 of Emma Lyon, who was later to become Lady Hamilton. The churchwardens' accounts date from 1701. External features In the churchyard is a sundial dated 1717 consisting of a red sandstone vase-baluster on a square base. It is listed at Grade II. Close to the church, and also listed at Grade II, is a hearse house built in red sandstone with a slate roof and red ridge tiles. Susan Burney (daughter of the music historian Charles Burney, sister of the novelist Fanny Burney is buried in the churchyard. The churchyard contains the war graves of seven British service personnel of World War I.

Born in Patrickswell, County Limerick, Howard first arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of twenty-one when he first linked up with the Limerick senior team, before later lining out with the Dublin and Tipperary sides before returning to the Limerick colours. He made his senior debut in the 1921 championship. Howard went on to enjoy a fifteen-year inter-county career, and won five All-Ireland medals, five Munster medals, three Leinster medals and four National Hurling League medals. He was an All-Ireland runner- up on two occasions. Howard represented the Munster and Leinster inter- provincial teams at various times, winning two Railway Cup medals during that period. At club level he won eight championship medals, playing with a host of clubs including Croom, Garda and Toomevara. With Ireland Howard won two Tailteann Games medals, while he also represented his country in shinty. His retirement came following the conclusion of the 1936 championship. In retirement from playing, Howard became involved in team management and coaching. At inter-county level he guided Clare to an Oireachtas Cup as well as a first Munster final appearance in seventeen years. At club level he trained Feakle and Burgess-Kildangan. Howard also served as a club referee. Howard was the third recipient of the All-Time All-Star Award in 1982, and holds the record of being the only Limerick man to have won five All-Ireland medals. Playing career =Club= Howard enjoyed his first success in club hurling with Croom in 1919. A narrow 1‚Äì1 to 1‚Äì0 defeat of Fedamore gave him a Limerick Senior Hurling Championship medal. A move to Dublin saw Howard join the Garda club which enjoyed an unprecedented run of success in the late twenties. Five successive championship titles were annexed between 1925 and 1929, with Howard lining out in each of these victories. Howard finished his club hurling career with Toomevara. In 1930 he won a championship medal following a 4‚Äì1 to 1‚Äì0 defeat of Boherlahan in a replay of the decider Toomevara retained their championship title in 1931, with Howard collecting a second consecutive championship medal following a 5‚Äì4 to 2‚Äì0 defeat of Moycarkey-Borris. =Inter-county= Beginnings Howard joined the Limerick senior team in 1921, at a time when the championship was severely hampered by the War of Independence. As a result of this disruption only Cork and Limerick contested the southern provincial championship. A 5‚Äì2 to 1‚Äì2 defeat of the reigning champions gave Howard his first Munster medal. The subsequent All-Ireland final was delayed until 4 March 1923, with Howard included on the Limerick team to face Dublin. Limerick captain Bob McConkey scored a hat-trick of goals in the opening half, before adding a fourth after the interval. Limerick eventually powered to an 8‚Äì5 to 3‚Äì2 victory. It was Howard's first All-Ireland medal. Success with Dublin In 1924 Howard transferred to the Dublin senior team. Success was immediate as he captured a Leinster medal following a 4‚Äì4 to 3‚Äì1 defeat of first-time finalists Offaly. The subsequent All-Ireland final was played on 14 December 1924, with reigning champions Galway providing the opposition. The westerners had the measure of Dublin for much of the game, however, Dublin got back on level terms when Howard drove the Galway goalkeeper into and under the net before scoring a second goal. Dublin eventually won the game on a score line of 5‚Äì3 to 2‚Äì6 and Howard collected his second All-Ireland medal. Three years later in 1927 Howard won a second Leinster medal following a 7‚Äì7 to 4‚Äì6 defeat of Kilkenny. On 4 September 1927 Dublin faced reigning champions Cork in the All-Ireland decider. Howard was one of nine members of an Garda S√≠och√°na on the Dublin team who took a 2‚Äì3 to 0‚Äì1 lead at half-time. Cork fought back in the third quarter, however, Howard collected his third All-Ireland medal following a 4‚Äì8 to 1‚Äì3 victory. Howard added a third Leinster medal to his collection in 1928 following a 9‚Äì7 to 4‚Äì3 defeat of Offaly. In 1930 Howard's Dublin renewed their rivalry with Cork, this time in the final of the National Hurling League. A 7‚Äì4 to 5‚Äì5 victory gave him his first league medal. Move to Tipperary A transfer to Toomevara, County Tipperary in his duties as a Garda saw Howard link up with the Tipperary senior team. He played two championship campaigns with Tipp in 1931 and 1932 without success, however, he did win a Thomond Feis medal. Return to Limerick In 1933 overtures were made to Howard encouraging him to rejoin an up-an-coming Limerick senior team. Howard agreed and played championship hurling with his native county after an absence of a decade. His return in green and white saw an upsurge in Limerick's fortunes as the team reached the provincial decider against Waterford in 1933. With eight minutes left in the game, some spectators invaded the pitch and the match was abandoned. Since Limerick were winning by 3‚Äì7 to 1‚Äì2, the Munster Council declared them the champions and Howard collected his second Munster medal. The subsequent All-Ireland final on 3 September 1933 saw a record crowd of 45,176 travel to Croke Park to see Limerick face Kilkenny. After being level at the interval, the game remained close in the second half until a solo-run goal by Johnny Dunne sealed a 1‚Äì7 to 0‚Äì6 victory for Kilkenny. The league campaign in 1933‚Äì34 saw Limerick reach the decider against Dublin. In spite of home advantage, Limerick had to battle hard for a 3‚Äì6 to 3‚Äì3 victory. It was Howard's second league medal. The subsequent provincial championship saw Limerick reach the decider, where they played Waterford for the second year in-a-row. The result was much the same, with Howard collecting a third Munster medal following a 4‚Äì8 to 2‚Äì5 victory. The All-Ireland final on 2 September 1934 was a special occasion as it was the golden jubilee final of the Gaelic Athletic Association. Dublin were the opponents and a close game developed. After leading by a point at the interval, Limerick went five clear with time running out. Dublin fought their way back to secure a remarkable draw. The replay on 30 September turned out to be an even closer affair, with both sides level with two minutes to go. Points from Mick Mackey and Jackie O'Connell and a remarkable four goals from Dave Clohessy secured a 5‚Äì2 to 2‚Äì6 victory for Limerick. The win gave Howard a fourth All-Ireland medal. Howard added a third National League medal to his collection in 1935, as Limerick retained their title in a straightforward league format. Limerick dominated the provincial series of games once again, and lined out in the decider against Tipperary. Howard collected a fourth Munster medal following a 5‚Äì5 to 1‚Äì4 victory. Kilkenny were Limerick's opponents in the subsequent All-Ireland final on 1 September 1935 and, once again, the game was a close affair. Limerick were the favourites, and a record crowd of over 46,000 turned up to the game. At the beginning of the second-half Lory Meagher sent over a huge point from midfield giving Kilkenny a lead which they would not surrender. The game ended in controversial circumstances for Mick Mackey when Limerick were awarded a close-in free to level the game. Jack Keane issued an instruction from the sideline that Timmy Ryan, the team captain, was to take the free and put the sliotar over the bar for the equalising point. As he lined up to take it, Mackey pushed him aside and took the free himself. The shot dropped short and into the waiting hands of the Kilkenny goalkeeper and was cleared. The game ended shortly after with Kilkenny triumphing by 2‚Äì5 to 2‚Äì4. Limerick began 1936 by retaining their league title, having won seven of their games and drawing one. It was Howard's fourth league medal. As a result of a tour to the United States, Limerick were awarded a bye into the Munster final. Tipperary provided the opposition in the provincial final, however, Limerick captain Mick Mackey ran riot and scored 5‚Äì3. The 8‚Äì5 to 4‚Äì6 victory gave Howard a fifth Munster medal. For the third time in four years the lure of a Kilkenny- Limerick clash brought a record crowd of over 50,000 to Croke Park for the All-Ireland decider on 6 September 1936. The first half produced a game that lived up to the previous clashes, and Limerick had a two-point advantage at half-time. Jackie Power scored two first-half goals, while a solo-run goal by captain Mackey in the second-half helped Limerick to a 5‚Äì6 to 1‚Äì5 victory. It was Howard's fifth All-Ireland medal, a record for a Limerick player. This was his last appearance for Limerick as he retired shortly afterwards. =Inter- provincial= Howard's inter-county performances ensured his selection on the inaugural Leinster team for the inter-provincial championship. A 7‚Äì6 to 3‚Äì5 defeat of Connacht gave him a Railway Cup medal. Leinster faced defeat at the hands of Munster in the deciders of 1928 and 1929. Howard's return to Limerick saw him included on the Munster team in 1931. A 1‚Äì12 to 2‚Äì6 defeat of Leinster gave him a second Railway Cup medal. =International= With the revival of the Tailteann Games in 1924, Howard received the ultimate honour by being one of fifteen hurlers chosen to make up an Irish hurling team. Ireland defeated a United States selection on that occasion. That same year he also played against Scotland in a shinty international. In 1928 Howard was once again included on the Irish hurling team for the Tailteann Games. The United States were defeated by the Irish selection once again. Coaching career =Clare= At inter-county level Howard was trainer of the Clare senior hurling team for a brief period in the fifties. In 1954 he guided the team to a 3‚Äì6 to 0‚Äì12 defeat of All-Ireland runners-up Wexford in the final of the Oireachtas Cup. In 1955 Clare defeated Cork and Tipperary in the provincial championship and were hot favourites to take the Munster title. An unfancied Limerick team upset the odds and defeated Howard's side by 2‚Äì16 to 2‚Äì6. =Naomh P√°draig= At club level Howard took charge of Naomh P√°draig, a combined Burgess and Kildangan under-21 team in the 1970s. Under him the club won back-to-back under-21 championships in 1970 and 1971. Howard also trained the Feakle hurling team for a time. Recognition As a hurler who claimed every honour in the game, Howard became (in 1982) the third recipient of the GAA All-Time All-Star Award. Personal life Howard was born in Fanningstown Castle, Patrickswell, County Limerick on 10 December 1899, the second eldest son to Martin and Kate Howard who were farmers Educated locally, Howard joined the newly formed Garda S√≠och√°na in his early twenties and served in Dublin, Toomevara, Portroe, Carrick-on-Suir and Feakle over the next forty years. Howard was married to Josephine \\"Josie\\" Barry (1906‚Äì1990), herself a niece of Tipperary hurler Frank McGrath, and the couple had six children: Kathleen, Pat, Jo, Liz, Ann and Garry. Jo Howard was a camogie star in her own right and played for both Clare and Tipperary before serving as the secretary of the North Tipperary Bord na n√ìg for ten years. Liz Howard was the first and only female analysts on the Sunday Game, before later serving as PRO of the Tipperary County Board and president of the Camogie Association. She also played camogie for Clare, Tipperary and Dublin. Pat and Ann also played camogie for Feakle. Howard's son, Garry, played under-21 hurling with Tipperary in 1972 while his grandson, also named Garrett, was a member of the Tipperary minor hurling team in 1997 and also won a Harty Cup and All Ireland Colleges title with St. Flannans College. Howard died at Dannell Nursing Home, Borrisokane on 20 January 1995, the last surviving member of the All-Ireland- winning Limerick and Dublin teams of the 1920s and 1930s.

Pitt wrote very highly coloured nature poetry, once much anthologised; and also wrote poetry in support of the socialist and labour movements. Marie Pitt was the companion of fellow poet and socialist Bernard O'Dowd. Life Pitt's maiden name was McKeown. She was born on 6 August 1869 in the gold-mining town of Bullumwaal in Gippsland region of the colony of Victoria, north of the town of Bairnsdale. Her early childhood was mostly spent in Wy Yung, a tiny settlement near Bairnsdale, where she laboured on her parents' \\"selection\\" or small farm. After failing to qualify as a teacher she found work in Bairnsdale as a photographic retoucher in 1887, and married the Tasmanian farmer and miner William Pitt in 1893 with whom she lived in Tasmania, the Western Australian goldfields, Bairnsdale again and finally Melbourne where she joined the Victorian Socialist Party and became editor of its journal The Socialist. In 1900 the prestigious Bulletin accepted one of her poems. Her first volume of poetry was published in 1911. William Pitt died in 1912 of a miners' disease. Marie and William Pitt had four children together, three of whom survived them. After William Pitt's death Pitt worked at various white-collar jobs and pursued her writing, as well as her work with the Victorian Socialist Party. She lived with Bernard O'Dowd as her partner from 1920 until her death. She shared with him support for the Victorian Socialist Party, and for Unitarianism. Her political views were not identical with his, however; notably, and unlike O'Dowd, Marie Pitt took a strong pacifist line. Another matter on which they differed was the endemic racism of the Australian labour movement; Marie Pitt, in a word, supported it and spoke of the \\"woman's instinct for racial purity\\". O'Dowd took an anti-racist view. Pitt won the Australian Broadcasting Commission national songwriting competition in 1944 with her entry Ave, Australia. Pitt died on 20 May 1948.

History The origins of the Congregation lie in their foundation in 1845 by the Abb√© Pierre Paul Blanck (1809 - ) in the remaining buildings of St. Mark Abbey () in Gueberschwihr (Geberschweier) in the canton of Rouffach, Alsace, of a women's community under the Benedictine Rule who accepted the Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament, the manual labor and the care of orphans. The buildings burnt down in 1852 and the difficulties facing the new community were so great that it seemed impossible for it to survive. Against all odds it did continue and was formally constituted as a Congregation on 9 October 1868, with the election and appointment of Sister Maria Xavier as Superior General. The German Sisters were forced to leave Alsace after the end of World War I and to seek new premises in Germany, which they found in the former St. Trudpert's monastery in M√ºnstertal. The first Sisters moved there in 1919 and the following year they established a separate Province of St. Trudpert within the Congregation. Their first ecclesiastical supervisor there was the Rev. Dean Willibald Strohmeyer (1877 - 1945), pastor of St. Trudpert, who was appointed in 1924. In 1925 the community began an ambitious programme of construction works not only on the monastic buildings but also on hospitals and other medical facilities. In 1926 the first Sisters left for Cleveland, Ohio, in America. During the economic collapse of Germany in 1929, the fraud and bankruptcy of the Freiburger Bank brought the community to the brink of ruin. All building works were suspended and the Sisters were reduced for years to a life of great poverty. The Sisters were permitted to remain in their premises during World War II, because they offered shelter to refugees and the homeless. Many Sisters worked in military hospitals. Unfortunately, in 1945 Willibald Strohmeyer, head of the Congregation, was murdered by the Nazis, having served 36 years as pastor of the town. A memorial chapel now stands on the site of his murder. After the end of the war the community at last found itself able to resume the interrupted renovations halted by the Great Depression. A convent chapel was dedicated in 1965. In 1970 the German province separated to become a fully independent Congregation. They lasted as such until 1997, when they chose to merge back with the original Congregation now headquartered in Colmar, France. The congregation now has four Provinces around the world. Today the Sisters run schools, leprosaria, tuberculosis wards and homes for the dying. Provinces =France= The French province, which has its provincial motherhouse in Saint-Marc, has 18 communities, with Sisters from France, Germany, India, Madagascar and Congo. =Germany= The Province of St. Trudpert is made up of 16 different communities. One of these communities is in Tanzania, Africa. The Sisters are of German and Indian nationalities. =St. Joseph Province, India= In 1960 the first Indian women were admitted as postulants in the German novitiate. In 1974 the first five native Sisters returned to India and began mission work in Madhya Pradesh. In the next year a house of the Congregation was opened in Sanawad and a novitiate was opened. By the end of the 1970s four other houses had been opened in India, at Palakkad in Kerala, Bhikkangaon and Nalvat, both in Madhya Pradesh and at Haresmara in Orissa. The Indian communities were established as St. Joseph Province, with its motherhouse at Indore, Madhya Pradesh, in 1989. There are 22 communities of Sisters in different States of India. =Kerala, India= The province of Sanjo in Vengoor in the state of Kerala in South India has 21 communities in different states of India. =Missions= There are two communities in the United States and another two in Ukraine.

The only option available to them was offered by the National Blood Transfusion Service, which carries out routine HIV tests on all the blood that is donated for transfusion purposes. The great need for testing and counseling resulted in a group of local non-governmental organizations such as The AIDS Support Organisation (TASO), Uganda Red Cross, Nsambya Home Care, the National Blood Bank, the Uganda Virus Research Institute together with the Ministry of Health establishing the AIDS Information Centre in 1990. This organization worked to provide HIV testing and counseling services with the knowledge and consent of the client involved. In Uganda, HIV/AIDS has been approached as more than a health issue and in 1992 a Multi-sectoral AIDS Control Approach was adopted. In addition, the Uganda AIDS Commission, also founded in 1992, has helped develop a national HIV/AIDS policy. A variety of approaches to AIDS education have been employed, ranging from the promotion of condom use to 'abstinence only' programs. To further Uganda's efforts in establishing a comprehensive HIV/AIDS program, in 2000 the Ugandan Ministry of Health implemented birth practices and safe infant feeding counseling. According to the WHO, around 41,000 women received Preventing Mother To child Transmission (PMTCT) services in 2001. Uganda was the first country to open a Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT) clinic in Africa called AIDS Information Centre and pioneered the concept of voluntary HIV testing centers in Sub-Saharan Africa. The Ugandan government, through President Yoweri Museveni, has promoted this as a success story in the fight against HIV and AIDS, arguing it has been the most effective national response to the pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa. Though equally there has in recent years been growing criticism that these claims are exaggerated, and that the HIV infection rate in Uganda is on the rise. There are striking similarities with the history of HIV/AIDS response in Senegal, where an equally high-level political response was encouraged by the fact that the HIV-2 strain of the disease was discovered by the Senegalese scientist Dr. Mboup. History Some residents in southern Uganda believe that Tanzanian soldiers introduced HIV/AIDS into the region during the 1979 Uganda‚ÄìTanzania War, spreading the disease by having sex with civilians. An overarching policy known as \\"ABC\\", which consisted of abstinence, monogamy, and condoms, was set up with the aim of helping to curb the spread of AIDS in Uganda, where HIV infections reached epidemic proportions in the 1980s.\\"HIV and AIDS in Uganda,\\" Avert.org. The prevalence of HIV began to decline in the late 1980s and continued throughout the 1990s. Between 1991 and 2007, HIV prevalence rates declined dramatically. Various claims have been made on the extent of these declines, but mathematical models estimated falls from about 15 percent in 1991 to about 6 percent in 2007.Epidemiological Fact Sheet on Uganda. UNAIDS (2008). Shortly after he came into office in 1986, President Museveni spearheaded a mass education campaign promoting a three-pronged AIDS prevention message: abstinence from sexual activity until marriage; monogamy within marriage; and condoms as a last resort. The message became commonly known as ABC: Abstinence, be faithful, use a condom if A and B fail. This message also addressed the high rates of concurrency in Uganda, which refers to the widespread cultural practice of maintaining two or more sexual partners at a time. Mass media campaigns also targeting this practice including the \\"Zero-Grazing\\" and \\"Love Carefully\\" public health messages in the 1990s The government used a multi-sector approach to spread its AIDS prevention message: it developed strong relationships with government, community and religious leaders who worked with the grassroots to teach ABC. Schools incorporated the ABC message into curricula, while faith-based communities trained leaders and community workers in ABC. The government also launched an aggressive media campaign using print, billboards, radio, and television to promote abstinence, monogamy, and condom use. Condoms were not the main element of the AIDS prevention message in the early years. President Museveni said, \\"We are being told that only a thin piece of rubber stands between us and the death of our Continent ... they (condoms) cannot become the main means of stemming the tide of AIDS.\\"Address by Janet K. Museveni, First Lady of Uganda at the Medical Institute for Sexual Health's \\"Common Ground: A Shared Vision for Health\\" Conference, Washington, D.C., 17‚Äì19 June 2004. He emphasized that condoms should be used, \\"if you cannot manage A and B ... as a fallback position, as a means of last resort.\\"President Museveni of Uganda, Interview with Jackie Judd , Kaiser Family Foundation, 14 June 2004. Some reports suggest that the decline in AIDS prevalence in Uganda was due to monogamy and abstinence, rather than condom use. According to Edward C. Green, a medical anthropologist at the Harvard School of Public Health, the promotion of fidelity to one's partner and abstinence were the most important factors in Uganda's success because they disrupted the widespread practice of having multiple concurrent sexual partners. Research found that in rural Uganda, the educational messaging regarding condom use was often not effective. In fact, it was found that twenty-three percent of adolescents surveyed did not even know about condoms. A 2004 study published in the journal Science also concluded that abstinence among young people and monogamy, rather than condom use, contributed to the decline of AIDS in Uganda. However, a field-study conducted in Rakai, a region in southern Uganda, showed that abstinence and fidelity rates had been declining during 1995‚Äì2002, but without the expected rise in HIV/AIDS rates, suggesting a greater role for condoms than acknowledged by Museveni. The other central finding of the Rakai study was that, due to Uganda's focus on prevention of the spread of HIV-AIDS, rather than treatment for those who had already contracted the disease, a large part of the decline in prevalence of HIV-AIDS is due to the premature death of those who have contracted it. This led to the popular play on the ABC campaign, 'A-B-C-D', with the D standing for Death. Because only prevalence is measured, incidence can actually increase while prevalence decreases if those who contract HIV are not treated for the disease, thereby dying younger. Later studies have seriously questioned the veracity of Uganda's miraculous HIV-AIDS claims . In the 1990s there had been limited access to treatment in the form of anti- retrovirals for those who are HIV positive. As access to anti-retrovirals increased in Uganda, however, studies began to investigate the conflicting social influences on a woman's desire to continue having children. It was found that while some women felt social obligated to continue reproducing in order to meet a respectable number of offspring, others felt societal taboo and pressure as parents with HIV were thought to be bearing orphans. Through the combined effort of US PEPFAR, the government of Uganda, and international agencies (Clinton HIV/AIDS Initiative, the Global Fund, UNITAID) this has improved.UGANDA: Optimism as PEPFAR increases funding*. PlusNews (2010-08-25) The country's HIV-AIDS campaign focuses solely on prevention rather than cure, and that prevention is of questionable success.  Criticism  The scope of Uganda's success has come under scrutiny from new research. Research published in The Lancet medical journal in 2002 questions the dramatic decline reported. It is claimed statistics have been distorted through the inaccurate extrapolation of data from small urban clinics to the entire population, nearly 90% of whom live in rural areas. Also, recent trials of the HIV drug nevirapine have come under intense scrutiny and criticism.Farber, Celia (2006-03-01). Out of Control . Harper's Magazine US-sponsored abstinence promotions have received recent criticism from observers for denying young people information about any method of HIV prevention other than sexual abstinence until marriage. Human Rights Watch says that such programs \\"leave Uganda‚Äôs children at risk of HIV\\".\\"Uganda: 'Abstinence-Only' Programs Hijack AIDS Success Story\\", Human Rights Watch (2005-03-30). Alternatively, the Roman Catholic organization Human Life International says that \\"condoms are adding to the problem, not solving it\\" and that \\"The government of Uganda believes its people have the human capacity to change their risky behaviors.\\" \\"An open letter to Melinda Gates\\" , Human Life International (2006-08-29). It is feared that HIV prevalence in Uganda may be rising again; at best it has reached a plateau where the number of new HIV infections matches the number of AIDS- related deaths. There are many theories as to why this may be happening, including the government‚Äôs shift from abstinence-based prevention programs, and a general complacency or 'AIDS fatigue'. It has been suggested that anti- retroviral drugs have changed the perception of AIDS from a death sentence to a treatable, manageable disease; this may have reduced the fear surrounding HIV, and in turn have led to an increase in risky behavior. Although prevention interventions, like safe male circumcision, have been shown to effectively reduce HIV transmission, studies in Uganda have shown delayed uptake of these interventions and attributed this to debate over evidence by high-level leaders. Although abstinence has always been part of the country‚Äôs prevention strategy it has come under scrutiny since 2003 following significant investment of money for abstinence-only programs from PEPFAR, the American government‚Äôs initiative to combat the global HIV/AIDS epidemic. It is felt that PEPFAR has shifted the focus of prevention in Uganda from the comprehensive ABC approach of earlier years. PEPFAR is channeling large sums of money through pro-abstinence and even anti-condom organizations that are faith-based, and believe sexual abstinence should be the central pillar of the fight against HIV. Abstinence-only is also being encouraged by evangelical churches within Uganda, and by the First Lady, Janet Museveni. This money is making a difference ‚Äì some Ugandan teachers report being instructed by US contractors not to discuss condoms in schools because the new policy is 'abstinence only'. Dozens of billboards around the country have sprung up promoting only abstinence to prevent HIV infection and sometimes discouraging condom use. Some leaders of small community-based organizations also report they are aware that they are more likely to receive money from PEPFAR (which is the largest HIV-related donor to the country) if they mention abstinence in their funding proposal.HIV and AIDS in Uganda. Avert.org (2012-09-21). Retrieved on 2012-11-26. There have been calls for a more nuanced view of Uganda's response to HIV/AIDS. There is no doubt that there has been sustained, long term political commitment at the highest levels of government on this issue. In other countries such as Zimbabwe or South Africa, inept leadership has led to a serious crisis; some such as former President Thabo Mbeki deny the link between HIV and AIDS. One aspect of the response to HIV in Uganda bridges the Millennium Development Goals and prevention‚Äîthat is vertical transmission or Prevention of Mother To Child Transmission (PMTCT). Through the Global Fund's Born HIV Free campaign BornHIVFree the need and impact of PMTCT is made clear. Funding is encouraged by UNITAID and MassiveGood  Structure of health provision  The provision of all health services in Uganda is shared between three groups: the government staffed and funded medical facilities; private for profit or self-employed medics including midwives and traditional birth attendants; and, NGO or philanthropic medical services. The international health funding and research community, such as the Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria, or bilateral donors are very active in Uganda. Part of the success in managing HIV/AIDS in Uganda has been due to the cooperation between the government and the non-government service providers and these international bodies. Public Private Partnerships in Health are often mentioned in Europe and North America to fund construction or research. In Uganda, it is more practical being the recognition by the (public) government and (public) donor that a (private) philanthropic health facility can receive free test kits for HIV screening, free mosquito nets and water purification to reduce opportunistic infections and free testing and treatment for basic infections of great danger to PLHA.Poverty News Blog: Hope Clinic Gives Hope to the Hopeless. Povertynewsblog.blogspot.com (2008-05-21). Retrieved on 2012-11-26.  Alternative proposals  Several studies, conducted in Uganda and its neighbors, indicate that adult male circumcision may be a cost-effective means of reducing HIV infection. A 2007 review of studies about the acceptability of adult male circumcision indicated the median proportion of uncircumcised men willing to become circumcised was 65 percent (range 29‚Äì87 percent). Sixty nine percent (range 47‚Äì79 percent) of women favored circumcision for their partners, and 71 percent (range 50‚Äì90 percent) of men and 81 percent (range 70‚Äì90 percent) of women were willing to circumcise their sons. The national AIDS Indicator survey in 2011 also indicated that over 48 percent of adult men were willing to be circumcised, generating a critical mass of demand for male circumcision. An economic analysis by Bertran Auvert, a physician from the INSERM U687, Saint-Maurive, France, and colleagues estimated the cost of a roll-out over an initial 5-year period would be $1036 million ($748 ‚Äì $1319 million) and $965 million ($763 ‚Äì $1301 million) for private and public health sectors, respectively. The cumulative net cost over the first 10 years was estimated at $1271 million and $173 million for the private and public sectors, respectively.Economic Analysis Supports Adult Male Circumcision for HIV Prevention in Sub-Saharan Africa, E.

Not long after, Enrico Caruso appeared there with the Metropolitan Opera in a performance of Flotow's Martha. One former opera singer for the Baltimore Opera is Mike Rowe, now well known as the television host of Dirty Jobs on The Discovery Channel. History In 1950, building on earlier amateur efforts, Baltimore Opera was formally established as the Baltimore Civic Opera Company, with the famous American soprano Rosa Ponselle as its first artistic director. She brought Beverly Sills to Baltimore for a production of Manon in 1952. By embarking upon a program of modernization in 1960 the company attracted private funding to be able to hire professional set designers and diversify its repertoire. In 1963, the Ford Foundation made a generous contribution that allowed the company to stabilize a format of three operas a season and to hire a full-time Production Manager. In subsequent years, it staged notable productions of such operas as Der Rosenkavalier, in 1962, with conductor Kurt Adler; Rigoletto, in 1964, with Sherrill Milnes, who also appeared as Escamillo in Carmen that year; Lucia di Lammermoor, in 1965, with Anna Moffo; Don Giovanni, in 1966, with Sills and Norman Treigle; Madama Butterfly, also in 1966, with Licia Albanese; Turandot, also in 1966, with Birgit Nilsson and Teresa Stratas; The Tales of Hoffmann in 1967 with Sills, Pl√°cido Domingo, and Treigle; and Boris Godunov, also in 1967, with Treigle. The name Baltimore Civic Opera Company was changed to Baltimore Opera Company in 1970 since the word \\"civic\\" denoted amateurism, a term deemed no longer applicable to the Company's offerings. For the occasion of the American Bicentennial in 1976, the Company appropriately commissioned its first work, opera In√™s de Castro, composed by Thomas Pasatieri with a libretto by Bernard Stambler. This work was a major American operatic event and featured a cast that included Richard Stilwell, James Morris, and Lili Chookasian, with staging by Tito Capobianco. In 1993, Baltimore Opera inaugurated its Summer Aria Series, dedicated to works by American composers and, in the following year, a sizable grant was awarded to the BOC by the National Arts Stabilization Fund in order to give the company complete financial stability. The 1994/1995 season saw additional subscription performance offered for each opera. Formerly, the company mounted four productions a year, one example being the 2007/2008 season which consisted of Verdi's La forza del destino, Donizetti's Maria Stuarda, Gounod's Rom√©o et Juliette, and Puccini's Madama Butterfly. After the BOC collapse in 2009, two companies sprang up in an attempt to take its place in producing opera in Baltimore: Baltimore Opera Theatre performs at the Hippodrome downtown, while Lyric Opera Baltimore has taken over the keystone role at the BOC's old venue, the Lyric Opera House.

Newmarket Workshops in Auckland was a major New Zealand Railways Department facility, one of 13 workshops nationwide. It was one of two main railway workshops of Auckland, used mainly for maintenance; the older facility at Newmarket was replaced in 1929 by Otahuhu Workshops.  History  = First Workshops = The original site between what today is the east of the Auckland CBD and Parnell. The original Auckland Railway Workshops constructed in 1875 consisted of buildings for machining and blacksmithing work, carriage maintenance, locomotive maintenance and a boiler house. Due to the unsuitable site on which the facilities were constructed, at the beginning of the Northclimb to Newmarket, there were soon plans to relocate the buildings. =Relocation to Newmarket= The Public Works Department announced on 13 October 1879 that it had purchased a suitable site for the workshops in Newmarket. Also motivating the workshops relocation was the need to use the land on which the existing buildings were sited to rearrange of the yard for the new Newmarket railway station. The contract for construction of the new workshops was let in March 1883 and completed by 30 November 1883. Relocation of plant and workshop staff to the new site occurred between October 1884 and February 1885. The new site was on both sides of Remuera Road, from Mahuru Street in the south to just north of the junction with the North Auckland Line, and bounded by Broadway on the western side, Middleton Road on the east. Up to 1908, while the Auckland section was isolated from the rest of the North Island rail network, the workshops were responsible for the construction of new carriages and the maintenance of all rolling stock used on the section. This remained the status quo until 1912, when the Auckland Harbour Board initiated a reclamation project that included an area reaching out to Campbell‚Äôs Point. Included in this project was a plan to extend King‚Äôs Drive (Quay Street) out to the point, but in order for this to happen the locomotive depot had to be moved as it straddled the road. Following a Harbour Board request, the Railways Department purchased land at Newmarket. Because the land was in a small gully, extensive earthworks were required to prepare the site, which were done by hand with the aid of horse-drawn muck trucks. Then plans to use the new site for the locomotive running shed were abandoned. The idea of moving the engine sheds to Newmarket from the Auckland Railway Station was mooted as early as 1912, and cited as one of the reasons why the Parnell Tunnel would have to be duplicated. General Manager E. H. Hiley reported on 1 August 1914 that because its reclaimed land at Mechanics Bay would all be required for an extension of the station yard and other traffic sidings, the locomotive depot would be sited on reclaimed land in Hobson Bay and that the land that had been designated for this purpose at Newmarket would be used to extend the workshops. The extension of the Newmarket site was delayed by the war, but the land was eventually used for the construction of a carriage and wagon workshop, which freed space in some of the other workshops for locomotive maintenance. It was reported on 21 July 1916 that work on the new workshops was well underway, and the new buildings were ready for use towards the end of the year. They included a timber drying shed, a wood mill, a carriage and wagon shop, a lifting shop, a blacksmiths' shop, a tarpaulin shop and a trimming shop. =Fay-Raven Commission, 1925= In 1925 a Royal Commission consisting of two English railwaymen, Sir Sam Fay and Sir Vincent Raven, was asked to report on New Zealand Railways. They made several recommendations regarding workshops around the country, particularly for Auckland and Wellington. With respect to the Newmarket site they were especially critical of the woodworking & machine shop, which was too small, the yard arrangement was inadequate and the separation of various facilities by Remuera Road necessitated shunting through a busy and congested yard, resulting in costly delays. The Minister of Railways reported in 1928 that it was possible to extend the existing workshops at Hillside and Addington in the South Island, but that the sites of the two main workshops in the North Island, at Newmarket and Petone, were hopelessly inadequate and that land was to be acquired at Otahuhu and Lower Hutt respectively to replace them. =Otahuhu Workshops= The new Otahuhu Workshops were opened after Christmas 1928, and Newmarket Workshops closed. Maintenance Unlike the other main centre workshops, locomotives were not constructed or rebuilt at Newmarket or Otahuhu, which specialised in repair and maintenance work. The only exceptions were one FA class (FA 276) in 1896, and nine rebuilds of F and L classes (Lloyd page 188). An experimental MacEwan-Pratt Railcar was built at Newmarket in 1912, but it did not prove satisfactory and was dismantled in 1913.  Today  New roads and urban development have obliterated most traces of the workshops.

See also ‚Äì List of West Bengal districts ranked by literacy rate =Language and religion= According to the District Census Handbook, Nadia, 2011 census, as of 2001, Bengali was the mother-tongue of 97.9% of the population of Nadia district district, followed by Hindi (1.1%), Santali (0.3%), Sadan/ Sadri (0.2%), Kurukh/ Oraon (0.1%), Telugu (0.1%) and other languges 0.3%. According to the West Bengal Official Language Act 1961 and the West Bengal Official Language (Amendment Act) 2012, the Bengali language is to be used for official purposes in the whole of West Bengal. In addition to Bengali, the Nepali language is to be used for official purposes in the three hills subdivisions, namely Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Kurseong, in the district of Darjeeling, and Urdu is to be used for official purposes in district/subdivision/ block/ municipality where the population speaking Urdu exceeds 10% of the total population. The English language will continue to be used for official purposes as it was being used prior to the enactment of these laws. The West Bengal Official Language (Second Amendment) Bill, 2012, included Hindi, Santhali, Odiya and Punjabi as official languages if it is spoken by a population exceeding 10 per cent of the whole in a particular block or sub-division or a district. Subsequently, Kamtapuri, Rajbanshi and Kurmali were also included in the list of minority languages by the West Bengal Official Language (Second Amendment) Bill, 2018.However, as of 2020, there is no official / other reliable information about the areas covered.

In the 2001 census, Hindus numbered 169,659 and formed 50.65% of the population of Nakshipara CD Block. Muslims numbered 164,836 and formed 49.21% of the population. In the 1991 census, Hindus numbered 138,963 and formed 50.93% of the population of Nakashipara CD Block. Muslims numbered 133,768 and formed 49.02% of the population. Rural poverty The District Human Development Report for Nadia has provided a CD Block-wise data table for Modified Human Vulnerability Index of the district. Nakashipara CD Block registered 35.61 on the MHPI scale. The CD Block-wise mean MHVI was estimated at 33.92. A total of 8 out of the 17 CD Blocks in Nadia district were found to be severely deprived when measured against the CD Block mean MHVI - Karimpur I and Karimpur II (under Tehatta subdivision), Kaliganj, Nakashipara, Chapra, Krishnanagar I and Nabadwip (under Krishnanagar Sadar subdivision) and Santipur (under Ranaghat subdivision) appear to be backward. As per the Human Development Report 2004 for West Bengal, the rural poverty ratio in Nadia district was 28.35%. The estimate was based on Central Sample data of NSS 55th round 1999-2000. Economy =Livelihood= In Nakashipara CD Block in 2011, amongst the class of total workers, cultivators formed 19.95%, agricultural labourers 46.16%, household industry workers 6.63% and other workers 27.26%. The southern part of Nadia district starting from Krishnanagar I down to Chakdaha and Haringhata has some urban pockets specialising in either manufacturing or service related economic activity and has reflected a comparatively higher concentration of population but the urban population has generally stagnated. Nadia district still has a large chunk of people living in the rural areas. =Infrastructure= There are 101 inhabited villages in Nakashipara CD Block. 100% villages have power supply and 100 villages (99.01%) had drinking water supply. 42 Villages (41.58%) have post offices. 94 villages (93.07%) have telephones (including landlines, public call offices and mobile phones). 48 villages (47.52%) have a pucca approach road and 46 villages (45.54%) have transport communication (includes bus service, rail facility and navigable waterways). 10 villages (9.90%) have agricultural credit societies and 13 villages (12.87%) have banks.It should, however, be noted that although 100% villages in Nadia district had power supply in 2011, a survey in 2007-08 revealed that less than 50% of households had electricity connection. In rural areas of the country, the tube well was for many years considered to be the provider of safe drinking water, but with arsenic contamination of ground water claiming public attention it is no longer so. Piped water supply is still a distant dream. In 2007-08, the availability of piped drinking water in Nadia district was as low as 8.6%, well below the state average of around 20%. =Agriculture= Although the Bargadari Act of 1950 recognised the rights of bargadars to a higher share of crops from the land that they tilled, it was not implemented fully. Large tracts, beyond the prescribed limit of land ceiling, remained with the rich landlords. From 1977 onwards major land reforms took place in West Bengal. Land in excess of land ceiling was acquired and distributed amongst the peasants.Following land reforms land ownership pattern has undergone transformation. In 2013-14, persons engaged in agriculture in Nakashipara CD Block could be classified as follows: bargadars 5.86%, patta (document) holders 8.27%, small farmers (possessing land between 1 and 2 hectares) 4.06%, marginal farmers (possessing land up to 1 hectare) 26.35% and agricultural labourers 55.46%.As the proportion of agricultural labourers is very high, the real wage in the agricultural sector has been a matter of concern. Nakashipara CD Block had 262 fertiliser depots, 18 seed stores and 79 fair price shops in 2013-14. In 2013-14, Nakashipara CD Block produced 7,340 tonnes of Aman paddy, the main winter crop from 2,813 hectares, 48,698 tonnes of Boro paddy (spring crop) from 11,922 hectares, 16,823 tonnes of Aus paddy (summer crop) from 6,739 hectares, 7,965 tonnes of wheat from 2,712 hectares, 235,317 tonnes of jute from 13,416 hectares and 80,074 tonnes of potatoes from 2,564 hectares. It also produced pulses and oilseeds. In 2013-14, the total area irrigated in Nakashipara CD Block was 1,579 hectares, out of which 850 hectares were irrigated by river lift irrigation, 576 hectares by deep tube wells and 153 hectares by shallow tube wells. =Banking= In 2013-14, Nakashipara CD Block had offices of 7 commercial banks and 5 gramin banks. Transport Nakashipara CD Block has 5 ferry services and 5 originating/ terminating bus routes. The Ranaghat-Lalgola branch line was opened in 1905. It passes through this CD Block and there are stations at Sonadanga railway station, Bethuadahari railway station and Muragacha railway station. NH 14 (old number NH 34) passes through this block. Education In 2013-14, Nakashipara CD Block had 185 primary schools with 25,688 students, 12 middle schools with 2,280 students, 7 high school with 4,433 students and 33 higher secondary schools with 45,658 students. Nakashipara CD Block had 1 general college with 4,125 students, 2 technical/ professional institutions with 184 students and 533 institutions for special and non-formal education with 20,764 students In Nakashipara CD Block, amongst the 101 inhabited villages, 2 villages had no school, 69 had more than 1 primary school, 52 had at least 1 primary school, 47 had at least 1 primary and 1 middle school and 29 had at least 1 middle and 1 secondary school. Healthcare In 2014, Nakashipara CD Block had 1 rural hospital and 4 primary health centres with total 80 beds and 9 doctors (excluding private bodies). It had 33 family welfare subcentres. 15,735 patients were treated indoor and 392,622 patients were treated outdoor in the hospitals, health centres and subcentres of the CD Block. Bethuadahari Rural Hospital, with 60 beds at Bethuadahari, is the major government medical facility in the Nakashipara CD block. There are primary health centres at Chakghurni (with 4 beds), Dharmada with 10 beds), Majhergram (with 6 beds) and Nakashipara (Dadpur) (with10 beds). Nakashipara CD Block is one of the areas of Nadia district where ground water is affected by moderate level of arsenic contamination. The WHO guideline for arsenic in drinking water is 10 mg/ litre, and the Indian Standard value is 50 mg/ litre. All the 17 blocks of Nadia district have arsenic contamination above this level. The maximum concentration in Nakashipara CD Block is 400 mg/litre. Bethuadahari Wildlife Sanctuary The Bethuadahari Wildlife Sanctuary covering 67 hectares, and established in 1980 in this CD Block, is an extended deer park, with some other wildlife and birds.

The freshwater molluscs of Canada. National Museum of Natural Sciences, National Museums of Canada, Ottawa, Canada. 447 pp. The shell has a rounded and broad spire that pinches in steeply at the apex. The spire short, conic, very small compared with the body whorl. There are 4‚Äì5 whorls with deep sutures between them. The whorls are convex, inflated, smooth and rapidly increasing. The body whorl is large and spreading. The surface is shining, lines of growth are fine, wavy, crowded, with occasionally a heavy ridge representing a rest period. Sutures are deeply impressed, channeled in some specimens. The color of the shell is yellow, beige or tan. The ear-shaped aperture, which contains no operculum, is around 5 times higher than the spire.Jokinen, E. 1992. The Freshwater Snails (Mollusca: Gastropoda) of New York State.

It is rounded above and flaring in old specimens below. The peristome is thin and sharp. The columella is sigmoid with a plait across the middle, which is reflected over the umbilicus. The umbilicus is either wide or covered. Usually the umbilicus is narrow, deep, nearly closed. The epidermis is sometimes marked by light and dark lines of color, alternating. The shell of the species can grow to ~30 mm in height and 25 mm in width as a full grown adult. However, most individuals in a population only grow to approximately half the maximum size. The width of the shell is from 12‚Äì18 mm, and the height of the shell is 14‚Äì24 mm.Gl√∂er, P. 2002 Die S√º√üwassergastropoden Nord- und Mitteleuropas.

In the Mid-Atlantic Region it is found in the Charles River in Massachusetts, Cayuga Lake and the Hudson River in New York State, in various ponds in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania, and in Lake Champlain in Vermont. In the Great Lakes Region: The first record of Radix auricularia in North America is from the Hudson River (which is connected through the New York Canal System to Lakes Erie and Ontario) near Troy, New York, before 1869.Mills, E. L., J. H. Leach, J. T. Carlton and C. L. Secor. 1993. Exotic species in the Great Lakes: a history of biotic crises and anthropogenic introductions. Journal of Great Lakes Research 19(1):1-54. The next record is from Lincoln Park, Chicago, beside Lake Michigan in 1901. Subsequently, it was found in Lake Erie and a tributary stream in 1911 and in 1948, and in Lake Ontario in 1930. It is also reported from Lake Huron.Dundee, D. S. 1974. Catalogue of introduced mollusks of eastern North America (north of Mexico). Sterkiana 55:1-37. This species has shown a potential to adapt to new environments within large lakes, as indicated by its recent history in Lake Baikal, Russia, where this introduced species was previously restricted to shallow bays and floodplain areas, but has recently been able to colonize the rocky drop-off in the lake.Stift, M., E. Michel, T. Y. Sitnikova, E. Y. Mamonova and D. Y. Sherbakov. 2004. Palaearctic gastropod gains a foothold in the dominion of endemics: range expansion and morphological change of Lymnaea (Radix) auricularia in Lake Baikal. Hydrobiologia 513(1-3):101-108. The shells of those snails in the new habitat have a more inflated aperture and are more compact than those in the shallow zones, indicating that wave action may have selected for snails with a stronger suctioning foot in the newly colonized habitat. Ecology = Habitat = This species is found in freshwater lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers with mud bottoms. Radix auricularia can live on boulders or vegetation in low or high-flow environments, and is capable of tolerating anoxic conditions, but it tends to prefer very lentic waters in lakes, bogs or slow rivers where there is a silt substrate.Sytsma, M.

Biologia (Bratislava) 40(10):1021-1030. =Feeding habits= Radix auricularia is in the family Lymnaeidae, which consists of scrapers and collector-gatherers. This species feeds on such items as detritus, Cladophora spp. (algae), and sand grains. =Life cycle= Like almost all pulmonate snails, it is a hermaphrodite. It undergoes oogenesis in spring as the daylight hours increase, and spermatogenesis in late summer and early fall as the daylight hours decrease.Berezkina, G. V. 1981. Seasonal changes in reproductive system of the Lymnaeidae. Zoologicheskii Zhurnal 60(7):978-983. It is iteroparous, breeding biennially.

The drama was controversial because it was reportedly based on real events, and was criticised because of its similarities to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann in May 2007. ITV denied any connection between the two, insisting that the series had been inspired by recent cases in the United States and had been written and filmed before Madeleine's disappearance. Plot =Episode One= The series begins in 1996 with a married couple, Sarah (Holly Aird) and David (Adam Kotz) Hooper, going to a busy beach with their young children Alice, Jasmine (Emma Natasha Miles) and Sean (Owen Donovan) on a bank holiday. After some time three-year-old Alice is accidentally left alone and vanishes when her father goes to get ice cream and her mother fails to hear his cries to watch her and presumes she is with him. A frantic search fails to yield any results, and Alice is presumed dead by drowning and is remembered through a commemoration plaque near the beach. The series then moves forward eleven years, with Sarah refusing to believe her daughter is dead. Whilst in a shopping centre several miles away from her home, she sees a girl (played by Jo Woodcock) who she believes is remarkably similar in appearance to Alice, and faints with shock. She later tells her husband, who maintains that Alice is dead and refuses to entertain Sarah's theories. Sarah returns to the centre, and after several hours of waiting, finds the girl again and follows her to her flat on an estate. The following day Sarah returns to the estate where she confronts the girl and her stepfather Stephen Turner (Bradley Walsh), and after a physical altercation is arrested. She receives a warning on the premise she does not approach the girl or the family again. Sarah, however, is determined that the girl (revealed to be called Lori) is actually Alice, and the depth of her belief appeals to D.S. Sally Bridges (Poppy Miller) who takes up the case. She visits the Turners' household where she sees photos allegedly of Lori as a baby and, on the way out, meets Lori and her mother Joanne Taylor (Nicola Walker) who reveals she has finally relented and let her daughter get a tattoo on her upper right arm. Thinking this overcompensation for the \\"ordeal\\", Bridges asks Sarah if Alice had any distinguishing marks and is told she had a small birthmark on her arm, supposedly in the same place as the tattoo on Lori. With this information, Bridges returns to the Turner/Taylor home and requests a birth certificate and, after to failing to provide one, Joanne breaks down revealing she kidnapped Alice after becoming depressed having found that she was not able to have her own children. =Episode Two= A distraught Joanne is charged, however Lori/Alice chooses to return to her home with Stephen and is allowed to under the belief she is over the age of 16. Sarah counters that she is only fourteen, and Lori/Alice is taken from her devastated stepfather and placed in a foster home. Against the wishes of Sarah, who wants her daughter to move in immediately, social services want to integrate her into the new family over time, and ask Sarah to prepare a photo album to help Alice get to know her real family. In viewing the album, Alice begins to remember her former life, and after an emotional confrontation with Joanne in custody, she storms out refusing to accept her emotional apology. As Joanne's trial approaches she requests that Sarah visits her so she can make a plea for her to protest against her going to prison. Sarah refuses and reveals to her husband that she wants the woman to feel as much pain as she went through for the last 11 years. However, the judge takes into account Joanne's depression and the loving relationship she had with Alice, and gives her a five-year suspended sentence on the provision that Joanne cuts all ties with Alice. Sarah is horrified, as she feels Joanne has gotten away with her crimes and may attempt to kidnap Alice again. Following the trial, tensions run high in the Hooper household, with David considering an affair with his secretary, Jasmine treating Alice harshly out of jealousy as her position as the sole daughter is threatened, and Sean developing a crush on Alice. Sarah, however, tries to help Alice cope with the change, suggesting she retake her GCSE exams on account of her false age and throwing a fifteenth birthday party for her. At this, Alice's boyfriend passes her a card from Joanne which Sarah finds, compounding her fears over the contact between them. The events spiral out of control when Jasmine overdoses on drugs and is admitted to hospital. There, Alice overhears Sarah and David conversing about the problems which have emerged since she joined the family and, incorrectly believing they were blaming her, runs away. When she is discovered missing, a frantic search begins, culminating in the discovery of Joanne's body at the bottom of her block of flats and, as suspicion is cast over the events surrounding her death, Sarah, the last person thought to have seen her alive, finds herself a suspect. =Episode Three= Details emerge over Joanne's death and it is revealed she died due to a blow to the back of her neck and was thrown from the apartments posthumously. Alice (who was found at the beach where she was kidnapped), David, Sarah and Stephen are interviewed over the incident, and the police discover that Sarah lied about her whereabouts when she changes her story in custody. She is subsequently arrested and, since David has not produced a verifiable story and is still a suspect, social services decide to place their children in foster care. Faced with the situation David reveals to D.S. Bridges that he was meeting with his secretary at the time of Joanne's death, and is released and allowed to retain custody of his children. Sarah remains at the police station, however eventually Stephen confesses the circumstances behind his wife's death. Joanne had told Stephen that she was planning on phoning Alice and telling her that they loved her but wouldn't be seeing her again until she was 16 and old enough to decide for herself whether she wanted contact. Stephen was against the idea and tried to stop her calling, but as she got up to walk into another room he accidentally pushed her into a table, killing her instantly. He reveals he stayed with her body until after dark and then pushed it from the balcony to feign the image of suicide. Sarah is released and, on the journey home, David admits he thought about an affair but maintains they were not romantically involved. Three months later the family return to the beach where the epic began and, in a final act of forgiveness, change the name on the plaque from Alice to Joanne, recognising her as a wife and mother.

The poet Gabriel Boc√°ngel wrote in 1653 \\"D. Thomas de Aguiar, who in the elegance of his numbers deserved testifies to the opinion of his own\\", which would confirm the origin of Aguiar as a gentleman with good education. The existence of some kind of relationship with Velasquez is further confirmed by the inventory of goods left at his death and his wife Juana Pacheco, inventory conducted by Juan Bautista Mart√≠nez del Mazo in August 1660, where an item designated as number 166 was collected, presumably a portrait painted by Vel√°zquez and now lost, described as \\"another cabe√ßa (head) of Don Tom√°s de Aguiar\\". Playwright and historian Antonio de Sol√≠s y Ribadeneyra, wrote \\"Don Tom√°s de Aguiar, a distinguished painter, and great Courtier\\", and dedicated a sonnet dedicated to him in response to Aguiar's painting a portrait of him: Aguiar died in Madrid, Spain in 1679.

Lynne Weedon (11 November 1958 - 10 September 1975) was a schoolgirl raped and beaten to death six months after Stratford. Neither case was solved at the time. After Weedon's cold case was re-opened in 2004, new DNA techniques revealed that she and Stratford had been murdered by the same person. Stratford's case was re-opened in 2007. Eve Stratford Eve Stratford was born in England in 1953 to Albert and Liza Stratford. Her mother was German, and met her father, a medic in the Royal Army Medical Corps, in the 1940s. The family moved around the world during Stratford's childhood, eventually settling in Aldershot. In 1972, she moved with her boyfriend to Leyton. At the time of her death, Stratford was working as a bunny in the Playboy Club in Park Lane. She had started work at the club in 1973, recommended by a friend. Shortly before her death, she appeared as the March 1975 centrefold in Mayfair magazine. Deaths =Stratford= Stratford was found dead by her boyfriend, on March 18, 1975, at their flat in Lyndhurst Drive, Leyton. Her throat had been cut between eight and twelve times. She was found partially unclothed with a nylon stocking tied around one ankle and her hands were bound with a scarf. Police found that on the day of her death, Stratford had visited Camden and Bayswater, but there was no sign that she had been followed. At 4:30 pm, the women living below her flat heard a male and female voice talking, followed by a bump. =Weedon= Sixteen- year-old Lynne Weedon was hit over the head with a blunt object and raped on 3 September 1975, six months after Stratford's death. She was attacked while taking a short-cut to her home in Hounslow. She was discovered the next morning, and despite her injuries was still alive, but she died a week later in hospital without regaining consciousness. Neither case was solved at the time. =Cold case= In 2004, the Weedon investigation was re-opened. In 2007, new DNA technology showed that both murders were committed by the same person. As a result of the link, Stratford's case was re-opened. Both were featured in September 2007 on the BBC Crimewatch programme, where DCI Andy Mortimer suggested that both murders were sexually motivated. Operation Stealth, the police operation which has been investigating unsolved murders since 2008, received funding to continue work until the end of 2011. On 29 August 2012, London's Evening Standard newspaper reported that police will continue investigating the deaths using the same new forensics techniques that helped convict the killers of Stephen Lawrence. On 25 March 2015, police issued a fresh appeal to coincide with the 40th anniversary of the murder of Eve Stratford.

The Pembroke/Plympton town line is entirely within the lake, and a portion of the western shoreline of the lake is the town line with Halifax. It used to be called the Jones River Pond, but its name was changed to Silver Lake in the 1800s in a marketing effort to sell more ice from it. The lake is the principal water supply for the City of Brockton, whose water treatment plant is on Route 36 in Halifax. The inflow of the pond is Tubbs Meadow Brook, and the pond is the headwaters of the Jones River. Occasionally water is diverted into Silver Lake from Monponsett Pond in Halifax and Furnace Pond in Pembroke (through Tubbs Meadow Brook) whenever there is a water shortage. Although the lake is a reservoir, which prevents recreational activities to keep the drinking water clean, the water from the diversions are not and can pump in contaminated water. Monponsett Pond in particular has reoccurring toxic algae growths which get transferred into the lake. It is supposed to be the main source of the Jones River by contributing about twenty percent of the river's flow, but the Forge Pond Dam near its base lets out minimal, some years no, water to the river.

World War I  On mobilisation in 1914, it came under control of the Third Army and comprised the 7th and 8th Infantry Divisions. The 7th Inf Div consisted of the 13th Brigade with the 101st and 102nd Infantry Regiments and the 14th Inf Bde with the 103rd and 104th Infantry Regiments. Also part of the Division was a squadron of the 14th R√©giment de hussards, the 25e r√©giment d'artillerie de campagne, and the 1st Engineer Regiment. The 8th Inf Div had the 15th Brigade (124th and 130th Infantry Regts) and the 16th Brigade (115th and 117th Infantry Regiments) plus the 31e r√©giment de hussards.

World War II  During the 1940 Battle of France the 4th Army Corps was part of the French First Army Group's First Army, and included the 32nd Infantry Division. On 10 May 1940 corps headquarters was at Le Cateau under General de corps d'armee Boris; 15th Infantry Division headquarters was at Chauny. On 7 August 1941 General Doyen was the Head of the French Mission, Armistice Commission at Wiesbaden, Germany. He promptly retired upon this assignment. At some time in 1942 he was arrested. It was around the time that the Allies invaded French North Africa and Germany responded by occupying the whole of France. On 6 June 1944 the Allies invaded Normandy, France; shortly after French Troops under Jean Lattre De Tassigny invaded the coast of Provence in south of France. Paris was liberated on by 25 August and General DeGaulle was reforming the French Military for the invasion of Germany. De Gaulle was very keen on France playing a major role in the war; as a result General Doyen was recalled to service on 1 Feb 1945. General Doyen's first assignment was to be the Inspector General of Mountain Troops along the Franco-Italian border on 21 March 1945; it was under this command that the French 27th Alpine Division was assigned. In general the French divisions on the Franco-Italian border were grouped into the French Alpine Army and invaded northern Italy. Since Italy invaded France in 1940 and since German troops were on the Italian side of the Franco-Italian border De Gaulle order General Doyen to invade Italy. His army advanced attacking border fortification and taking Cuneo; Valle d'Aosta; Tende; several troops swept into the Italian Riviera and advancing as far as Imperia. Other elements of General Doyen's Alpine Army troops marched as far as Turin, Italy where they met up with American and Brazilian troops coming from the southeast. 15 March 1946 General Doyen was given the command of French Army's IV Corps and shortly after he was made the Military Governor of Lyon, France only to retire from the military later in 1946.

It appears he was a pupil of Antonio Lolli and he was an acquaintance of Joseph Haydn, with whom he shared concert programmes in London. Jarnoviƒá was reputedly born at sea en route from Dubrovnik to Palermo, Sicily (or was possibly born in Palermo), where he was baptised in the church San Antonio Abate on 29 October 1747.Kataliniƒá, Vjera. 2006.

Zagreb, 1980, pp. 119-130 He died in St Petersburg, Russia on 23 November 1804. Biographical gaps Whole periods of his life - his youth and other interludes - remain unaccounted for, while details as to his origins and identity have proven to be elusive. There are plausible arguments to suggest that his family was from Croatia, possibly from the Karlovac-Delnice region.Tuksar, S. 1980. The question of Jarnoviƒá's identity: archive work in progress. In Tuksar, S. (ed) Ivan Mane Jarnoviƒá: a Croatian composer II. Zagreb, 1980, pp. 119-130 Highlighting a further riddle concerning his identity, Schneider and Tuksar both point out that Jarnovic's (or Giornovichi's) first names, Giovanni Mane, do not appear in any literature about him until 36 years after his death, namely in Schilling's Enzyclopadie of 1840. These names become the form most usually cited in encyclopaedic and biographical works from then onwards, often rendered today in their Croatian form as Ivan Mane Jarnoviƒá. It is \\"quite incredible,\\" Tuksar has remarked, \\"that one of the leading musicians of 18th century Europe could have lived for 64 years without his name and surname ever being given anywhere, not even in his printed works, in their full and proper form.\\" Besides Jarnoviƒá, several variations in the rendition of his surname also occur: Jarnowick, Jarnovick, Jarnovichi, Jarnowicz, Garnovik, Giarnovicki, Giernovichi. It seems likely that shifts in the spelling and pronunciation of his name occurred according to the country in which he was living or performing or publishing his works at any given time. At least one source does exist which indicates his first and last names, namely a register entry recording the baptism of Jarnoviƒá's daughter Sophia, in London, in 1795. The same document throws light on yet another area of uncertainty - that of Jarnoviƒá's family. Whereas little was previously known of the fate of his daughters \\"Mimi\\" and \\"Sofie\\", something of their lives and subsequent history is now on record.Morris, D. 2004. The daughters of Jarnoviƒá: a preliminary note. Arti Musices (Zagreb) 35:31-45. Debut in Paris, 1773 Jarnoviƒá made a \\"sensational\\" debut in Paris, at a Concert Spirituel on 25 March 1773, and appeared in three successive concerts in which he was billed as the \\"fameux violoniste\\". He was for some years \\"all the rage in that capital\\". The Mercure de France described his playing as brilliant, finished and mannered, at the same time that it was sensitive and animated; he was \\"celebre\\" for the \\"beau fini\\" and \\"l'elegance et l'expression\\" of his playing. There is reference to at least five concert performances in 1775, five in 1776 and one in 1777, in addition to private concerts in many Parisian salons. In December 1775 he had \\"amazed\\" his audience and \\"seemed to surpass himself in his new violin concerto and in the little airs varies that he played following it\\".Details and contemporary citations in Nunamaker, Norman Kirt. 1968.

The Mercure de France later described the Polish violinist Felix Janiewicz as his student on the latter's appearance at a Concert Spirituel. Positions held in Prussia and Russia and extensive travels across Europe In addition to other appointments, he appeared from 1779 to 1783 in the service of the Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm II of Prussia. On 14 May 1783 he was granted a three-year contract, in St Petersburg, in the service of Catherine II, Empress of Russia. Hereafter he returned westwards, performing, among other places, in Vienna and Paris. He resided in England from 1790 to 1796, \\"and there met with much success\\". Principally he performed in London but also in Bath, Edinburgh and in Dublin, before returning to the concert platforms of Europe, performing in Hamburg, Berlin and elsewhere in Germany between 1797 and 1802. A correspondent for the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung reported that \\"since my last letter there have been three concerts here of very diverse nature. The first and indisputably one of the most superior ones of the entire winter, was given on March 21 by Herr Giornowich ... one admires in the two violin concertos composed by him the beauty and novelty of the ideas just as much as the dexterity, power and extraordinary subtlety in the playing.\\"Cited by Nunamaker, Norman Kirt. 1968.

Although the amount of time people have spent in motion has remained constant since 1950, the shift from feet and bicycles to cars and planes has increased the speed of travel fivefold. This results in the twin effects of wider and shallower regions of social activity around each person (further exacerbated by electronic communication which can be seen as a form of virtual mobility), and a degradation of the social and physical environment brought about by the high speed traffic (as theorised by urban designer Donald Appleyard). The changes are brought about locally due to the use of cars and motorways, and internationally by aeroplanes. Some of the social threats of hypermobility include: * more polarisation between rich and poor * reduced health and fitness The addictive properties of hypermobile travel have been noted by researchers.Higham J.E.S., Cohen S.A., Cavaliere C.T.

Hypermobility is now the opium of the people, an obsession that wrecks communities and planet. The Guardian. 22 Dec. 2009. Widespread Internet use is seen as a contributory factor towards hypermobility due to the increased ease which it enables travel to be desired and organized. To the extent that the Internet stimulates travel, it represents a lost opportunity to reduce overall emissions because online communication is a straightforward substitute for physical travel. The term hypermobility arose around 1980 concerning the flow of capital,Damette F (1980). The regional framework of monopoly exploitation: new problems and trends.

It was highly successful, climbing to a circulation peak of more than four million during the 1930s and 1940s. The magazine, headquartered in Springfield, Ohio, was discontinued in 1957. Among the contributors to the magazine were editor Gene Gauntier, and authors Temple Bailey, Ellis Parker Butler, Rachel Carson, Arthur Guiterman, Shirley Jackson, Anita Loos, Neysa McMein, Kathleen Norris, Sylvia Schur, John Steinbeck, Willa Cather, Frank Albert Waugh and P. G. Wodehouse. Notable illustrators included Rolf Armstrong, W≈Çadys≈Çaw T. Benda, Elizabeth Shippen Green, Bessie Pease Gutmann, Rico Lebrun, Neysa McMein, Violet Oakley, Herbert Paus, May Wilson Preston, Olive Rush, Arthur Sarnoff and Frederic Dorr Steele. History =19th- Century=  Early Days  Spurred on by the success of other mail-order monthlies, two brothers, S.L. and Frederick Thorpe of Cleveland, Ohio started their magazine in 1874. The magazine called The Home was only eight pages in size, produced on cheap paper and the subscription price was fifty cents a year. The content consisted of household articles, fiction by unknown writers and advertisements mostly for mail-order items. A year after Frederick died in 1877, S.L. acquired another Cleveland periodical called Little Ones at Home. Thorpe consolidated both titles under the new title of Home Companion: A Monthly for Young People. According to Thorpe, but not verified officially circulation reached eighty-eight thousand. Thorpe had been studying medicine, and when he started his practice in 1881, he sold the paper to E.B. Harvey and Frank S. Finn. In 1882, after starting a higher-class magazine without advertising called Young Folks' Circle, Harvey & Finn sold The Home Companion to Mast, Crowell, & Kirkpatrick of Springfield, Ohio.  1880s  Phineas P. Mast had hired John Crowell of Lexington, Kentucky to launch and manage Farm & Fireside magazine in Springfield, Ohio. P.P. Mast made his money through agricultural equipment and wanted a magazine to promote his wares. Farm & Fireside launched in 1877, and the firm acquired The Home Companion in 1883 after realizing the market for content aimed at women. Crowell then purchased Harvey & Finn's Young Folks' Circle in 1884, which was absorbed into The Home Companion two years later. In November 1886, the name of the periodical was changed to Ladies' Home Companion. Mast's nephew, T.J. Kirkpatrick was the first general editor of the periodical. During the 1880s, the magazine changed size and length, and the quality of the content was improved by the addition of writers such as Maria Louise Pool, James Otis, and Eben E. Rexford. Now published semi-monthly, an important feature of the magazine was a Practical Housekeeping department, which was created by Eliza R. Parker. Woodcuts were used for illustration and at times the magazine reprinted articles from other magazines. Coverage was given to food, fashion, and serialized fiction. Topics covered included‚Äîhousehold budgeting, home building, and furnishing, needlework, health, childcare, and etiquette. By 1889 circulation had reached eighty thousand, and, in 1890, it hit one hundred thousand. It was considered a leader in the field of women's interest magazines.  1890s  The cover was created for the first time for the Christmas issue of 1891‚Äîcovers would not become a regular feature until three or four years later and halftone pictures made from photographs would appear in 1891. It was in 1893 that the price of the magazine was raised to one dollar a year. At the time the Companion competed with the Ladies' Home Journal which was twice as long, only published twelve times a year, and had a much larger circulation. To compete, the Companion went to a monthly publication and cut the price back to fifty cents‚Äîat the same time it upped the quality of its articles and writers. Circulation soon rose to 300,000 by 1898‚Äîstill only half of the Ladies' Home Journal. To further the distance‚Äîthe Companion's name was officially changed to Woman's Home Companion in 1896. According to Frank L. Mott's History of the American Magazine, the editor, presumably Joseph F. Henderson, wrote of the change in the January 1887 edition: > The indiscriminate use and abuse of the term \\"lady\\" has robbed it of so much > of its meaning that it has been in a measure tabooed by those who deserve > the title in its best sense. The noblest ambition of our end-of-the-century > femininity is to be a \\"woman.\\"...\\"Woman\\" is an honest Anglo-Saxon word, and > has no synonym. The use of \\"lady\\" as a synonym for \\"woman\\" is vulgar. During the 1890s in addition to housekeeping tips the magazine also covered subjects such as college education for girls, women in the arts and civil service, travel abroad, women's clubs and health. There was no mention of the war with Spain except for one article on the American Red Cross in the September 1898 issue. = 20th century =  Turn of the Century  At the turn of the century, the magazine's parent company went through some changes. P.P. Mast died in 1898 and 1901, T. J. Kirkpatrick sold his remaining interests to John Crowell and the main editorial offices were moved to New York (printing was to remain in Springfield). In 1906, Joseph P. Knapp paid $750,000 for controlling interest in the Crowell Publishing Company. During this period the magazine went from twelve pages of advertisements in 1901 to over 75 by 1907. At the same time, the magazine went through editor and editorial changes as well. Arthur T. Vance became the editor in 1901 and Vance pushed to broaden the scope of the magazine into general interest areas. During this time many magazines were outlets for what was called muckraking journalism‚Äîa general movement in journalism from after 1900 until around World War I. Editors and journalists took on investigative reporting to raise public awareness of social issues of the day. Woman's Home Companion was not known as a muckraking magazine, but under Vance's editorial-ship and push towards general interest stories, the magazine featured a crusade against child slavery during 1906-07. Coverage included child-workers in cotton mills, canning factories, tailoring, and sweat shops. The January 1907 issue featured a statement signed by President Theodore Roosevelt entitled, Where I Stand on Child Labor Reform. Under Vance there was coverage of art and music, architecture, books in addition to the regular departments dealing with fashion and the home. Vance was also interested in short stories and the list of authors who published included Frank H. Spearman, Hamlin Garland, Sarah Orne Jewett, Bret Harte, Robert Grant, Jack London, Eden Philpotts, Morgan Robertson and Rafael Sabatini. Jack London wrote the short story the Apostate, which was published in the September 1906 edition. London also published coverage of his cruise around the South Pacific under the title, Round the World for the Woman's Home Companion . This journey was also the basis for London's book The Cruise of the Snark. The Battles Lane years The most influential editor of Woman's Home Companion was Gertrude Battles Lane (December 21, 1874 ‚Äì September 25, 1941), the editor from 1911 until a few months before her death in 1941. Lane started her editing career with Crowell in 1903 at eighteen dollars a week‚Äîher salary before she died was fifty thousand a year. Frank Luther Mott, Dean Emeritus of the School of Journalism at the University of Missouri and winner of a Pulitzer prize for the History of Magazines in America stated that Lane was one of the greatest woman editors of her generation. Lane understood her audience and once stated her editorial creed which was aspirational for her readers: > In editing the Woman's Home Companion, I keep constantly in mind a picture > of the housewife of today as I see her. She is not the woman who wants to do > more housework, but the woman who wants to do less housework so that she > will have more time for other things. > She is intelligent and clear-headed; I must tell her the truth. She is busy; > I must not waste her time. She is forever seeking new ideas; I must keep her > in touch with the best. Her horizon is ever extending, her interest > broadening: the pages of the Woman's Home Companion must reflect the sanest > and most constructive thought on vital issues of the day. During the first World War, Margaret Deland reported from France and Lane spent time in Washington working with the Food Administration. The magazine published a section called \\"Ideas for War Work at Home\\" and the magazine ran a Treasure and Trinket fun‚Äîwomen sold or melted jewelry and gave the proceeds to the Air Force. Under her directorship, each issue featured two serials, four to five short stories, six specials and many monthly departments.Bormfield, LH: \\"The Ways We Were: Celebrating 250 Years of Magazine Publishing\\", Folio: The Magazine for Magazine Management, March 1, 1991. For a time, Eleanor Roosevelt published a page in the magazine, and Presidents William Howard Taft, Woodrow Wilson, Calvin Coolidge, and Herbert Hoover wrote on occasion for the magazine. During this period, the Companion competed with Ladies' Home Journal, McCalls and Pictorial Review. By the 1930s, it led by a small margin with a circulation of 3,000,000 in 1938. Despite the high circulation advertising revenue declined for a while during the Great Depression but had begun to recover by 1939. Also in 1939, Crowell was reorganized as the Crowell-Collier Publishing Company.  World War II Years  After Lane died in 1941, the magazine changed editors and shifted focus. Willa Roberts, who had been a writer and staff member for twenty years, became the editor for a short time. The magazine covered the war with correspondents in Europe and support activities at home such as war gardens and home canning. Roberts was then followed up by Willam A. H. Birnie in 1943. Birnie had previously been the assistant editor of Crowell's the American Magazine and then the managing editor for the Companion. Birnie (who had started in newspapers) and Roger Dakin, an article editor shifted the focus of the magazine to crusading for causes‚Äîthe magazine became known as \\"the fighting lady.\\" An article on keeping children out of jail with adults resulted in New York state legislation. =Final years and shutdown= By the 1940s magazines had moved them away fiction and into more non-fiction coverage with an emphasis on features and articles rather than short stories and serials and the Woman's Home Companion followed suit. In another nod to changing times‚Äîthe Companion also moved advertising to the front of the magazine and double-page layouts of color became common. Circulation by 1950 was four million and advertisement rates were high by 1953 when the rate for a black-and-white page was $12,880. But then advertising declined rapidly, and the magazine faced hard times. Paul C. Smith, who was President of Crowell-Collier in 1954, was named editor-in-chief for Woman's Home Companion, Collier's and the American Magazine. A decade after editor Battles Lane death, the magazine began a decrease in page count, from 945 pages in 1951 to 544 pages in 1956.\\"Crowell-Collier's Christmas\\", Time Magazine, December 24, 1956 The situation at Collier's was comparable. Publisher Crowell-Collier closed The American Magazine, its healthier publication, in order to save Collier's and the Companion. By July 1956 it was calculated that the annual loss of the magazine would reach $3 million. Just before Christmas 1956, both ailing publications folded, and 2740 employees, mostly printing workers, were laid off without severance pay or pensions. Collier's and Woman's Home Companion came to an end January 1957, shortly after the first 1957 issues were distributed. In the History of the American Magazines, the closure of the Woman's Home Companion was \\"mourned by many readers, for it had long been a lively, interesting, and helpful member of the group of leading magazines for women and the home.\\" After shuttering the magazines Crowell Collier Publishing Company would reinvent itself as an educational company.  Other publications  Occasionally, the Companion's stories were collected in anthologies such as Seven Short Novels from the Woman's Home Companion, edited by Barthold Fles.Seven Short Novels from the Woman's Home Companion at the Library of Congress The magazine also published such non-fiction as John Wister's Woman's Home Companion Garden Book (Collier, 1947). A much-loved, classic collection of American recipes, The Woman's Home Companion Cook Book was compiled by the magazine's staff and edited by Dorothy Kirk in editions printed from 1942 through 1947 by P.F. Collier & Son Corporation, New York. This collection of over 2,600 recipes, with illustrations and homemaking instructions, is still prized by contemporary cooks. * Seven Short Novels from Woman's Home Companion (1949) * Woman's Home Companion Garden Book (1947) * Woman's Home Companion Household Book (1948) * The Woman's Home Companion Cook Book (various editions in the 1940s)  Stats and lists about the magazine  = Titles = * The Home (1874‚Äì78) * Home Companion (1878‚Äì86) * Our Young People (briefly in 1883) * Ladies' Home Companion (1886-1896) * Woman's Home Companion (1897-1957) = First and last issues = * First Issue: January 1874 * Last Issue: January 1957 = Publishing frequency = * Monthly (1874-1889) * Semi-Monthly (1880-1896) * Monthly (1896-1957) * Regular Annual Volumes = Publishers = * Thorpe & Bros., Cleveland, Ohio (1874-1877) * S.L.

David Stone. Biography David Stone was born in Eaubonne, (France). At 19, a school friend showed him magic tricks and taught him card manipulation. At 23, he won the Le Prix Diavol, a regional contest for magicians organised annually in France by FFAP. At 24, he won the Gold Dove (close-up category) award at the European championships of magic organized in France. The same year, David won the Close-up Grand Prix of South America in Las Tunas, Cuba. In 1995, David met the French magician St√©phane Jardonnet who truly launched his career by producing a video starring David (Basic Coin magic vol.1). This video became the first French magic program ever sold on the American market: with over 28,000 copies sold in 40 countries, this video was a best-seller. After obtaining a degree in Philosophy at the Amiens University, David decided to become professional magician. He went to Saint-Tropez and started working in some of the most prestigious restaurants of the Riviera, including seven years in La Voile Rouge, an amazing beach restaurant where he honed his craft. Thanks to these videos, Stone gained recognition in the world of professional magicians. Since 1999, he has performed his lecture on the art of Table hopping (professional magic in restaurants) at Magic conventions in more than 19 countries and is one of the most famous French magicians outside his country. His encounter in 2001 with magician and DVD producer Jean-Luc Bertrand produced a successful partnership that has yielded several short films and magic DVDs. Their first co-production, a short movie titled The Real Secrets of Magic, won the 1st prize at the first ever Magic Film Festival in Las Vegas (2006). In 2003, at the FFFF convention - Fechter's Finger-Flicking Frolic, the most prestigious gathering of close-up magicians in the world, David was voted as the Most Valuable Performer.

It contains the Gavrinis tomb, a megalithic monument notable for its abundance of megalithic art in the European Neolithic. Administratively, it is part of the commune of Larmor-Baden. Geography The island of Gavrinis Reachable by boat from the town of Larmor-Baden near the opening of Morbihan Gulf to the Atlantic Ocean, Gavrinis is an uninhabited granite rock outcrop of 750 √ó 400m. Its highest point dominates much of the surrounding area. Name The name Gavrinis is popularly believed to be derived from the Breton words gavr (goat) and enez (island), thus suggesting a meaning of \\"goat island\\". This is probably a false etymology. In documents dating from 1184 and 1202, the island is named as Guirv Enes and Guerg Enes, respectively. The old Breton word Guerg is not related to gavr, but to parallels such as Welsh gwery, or Old Irish ferg, signifying \\"wrath\\". The Gavrinis passage tomb =Importance= A decorated slab within the passage, note the anthropomorphic \\"shield\\" motif on top The island is famous for its important passage grave, a megalithic monument from the Neolithic period, belonging to the same broad context as the Breton megaliths of Carnac and Locmariaquer, and closely connected with the monuments at Br√∫ na Bo√≠nne (Ireland) and Maes Howe (Orkney). At the time of its construction, c. 3500 BC, the island was still connected with the mainland. The rich internal decorations make Gavrinis one of the major treasuries of European megalithic art. The tomb is also remarkable for the care taken in its construction and its good preservation. =History of research= The first excavations took place in 1835, when the internal chamber was discovered. Further research was undertaken by the archaeologist Zacharie Le Rouzic who began restoration work around 1930. Further works took place in the 1960s and 1970s. Charles-Tanguy Leroux, former director of Breton Antiquities, undertook studies and consolidation works in the 1980s. Further excavation is in the planning stages.Ouest-France, Thursday, 27 July 2006. The entrance to the Gavrinis passage grave =Date= The tomb was built relatively late within the French megalithic sequence. Its use ceased around 3000 BC. At that time, the light wooden structures cladding its entrance were burnt, after which part of the mound collapsed, obscuring and blocking the passage. A layer of windblown sand transformed the monument into a simple hillock. =The cairn= The stone mound has a diameter of about 50m. The mass of stones forming the cairn is internally structured by a series of walls, subdividing it into separate \\"ranks\\". It is a characteristic example of Neolithic dry stone architecture. =The chamber= The mound covers a single rectangular (nearly square) slab- built burial chamber, located at the centre of the mound and measuring about 2.5m across. The chamber is built of about 50 carefully placed slabs. The biggest of these is the ceiling slab which weighs nearly 17 tons. Such simple dolmen-type chambers, reached by passages, were very common in Brittany between 4500 and 3000 BC. At the same time, similar monuments were constructed in Normandy and Poitou, in Ireland, Britain, and the Iberian Peninsula. Bougon Museum =The passage and its art= The chamber is reached from outside by a 14m-long corridor or passage. Of the 29 orthostat slabs that form the sides of the passage, 23 are decorated with carved symbols and patterns. Some of the symbols appear to represent non-abstract objects, such as axes and croziers or staffs. A common horn-like motif may symbolise cattle, and a shape conventionally called the shield may be a very stylised human figure. More abstract motifs include zigzag lines, lozenges, and snake-like lines. =Reuse of stones= The cairn forms a type of stepped structure In 1984, it was discovered that the external side of some slabs, now covered by cairn material, is also decorated, but in a different style from their internal face. This decoration must have been applied before the cairn was erected. Archaeologists suspect that at least a number of those slabs may be in secondary use, having formed part of earlier monuments elsewhere. Most strikingly, the top of the chamber ceiling slab bore the depiction of a bull, the horns of a further animal, and a motif known from other monuments that has often been interpreted as an axe (Twohig 1981), but which has also been interpreted as a representation of a whale, and thus as a \\"mythic animal\\" (Whittle 2000). The slab can be joined with the ceiling stones of two other monuments, the Table des Marchands dolmen and the Er Vingl√© tomb, at Locmariaquer, at a distance of 4 km. The three slabs appear to have once formed a massive 14m standing stone, similar to the great broken menhir of Locmariaquer, which broke or was broken, to be reused as three ceiling slabs, its decorations deliberately obscured. Replica A replica of part of the Gavrinis passage with its decorated slabs can be visited in the museum at the megalithic necropolis of Bougon (Deux-S√®vres).

The gorge provides a valuable exposure of rock strata as old as 111 million years showing fossils and a set of dinosaur tracks, and forms a new ecosystem for wildlife with carp and other creatures in a series of pools fed by springs and waterfalls. The Gorge Preservation Society formed as a local citizen's group to develop long-term plans for the Gorge in partnership with the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Public access to the gorge is restricted to guided tours by the Society along a designated route for a hike lasting about three hours. Availability of tours is limited, no pets are permitted and no rock or fossil collecting is allowed. Research permits can be obtained by university or scientific research groups. The flood of 2002 In July 2002 up to of water per second flowed over the spillway of Canyon Lake, Texas for approximately six weeks, the first time the spillway had been in use since the reservoir dam was constructed in 1964. Normally, the flow out of the reservoir is around of water per second. The Guadalupe River basin forms a part of \\"Flash Flood Alley\\" which is one of the river basins most prone to flash flooding in the world. Nine people were killed by the flood over a stretch of the river, which damaged or destroyed 48,000 homes and cost around $1 billion in damages, but the Canyon Lake manager has stated that even though the floodwaters went over the spillway, the dam still prevented an estimated $38.6 million in damages downstream during the event. Educational and natural resource On November 29, 2005, a ceremony was held in which representatives of the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers signed an agreement to develop the gorge as an educational and natural resource. Significance for Geologists The 2002 flood at Canyon Lake and subsequent rapid formation of Canyon Lake Gorge presented a unique opportunity to study the geomorphological power of rapidly moving water and to better understand the process of canyon formation. Waterfalls and boulders in Canyon Lake Gorge In their 2010 study, Michael Lamb of the California Institute of Technology and Mark Fonstad of Texas State University documented the dramatic transformation of a section of the Guadalupe River Valley landscape into a steep-walled bedrock canyon in just three days.Lamb, M. P. and M. A. Fonstad. 2010. Rapid formation of a modern bedrock canyon by a single flood event. Nature Geoscience. 3 (7): 477-481. The scientists documented the excavation of bedrock limestone to an average depth of over 20 feet and average width of 130‚Äì200 feet for a distance of over one mile.Perkins, S. 2010. Even a newborn canyon is big in Texas. ScienceNews. 178 (2): 15. The ‚Äúplucking‚Äù and transport of massive boulders from the site resulted in the formation of several waterfalls, inner channels, and bedrock terraces. The abrasion of rock by sediment-loaded water sculpted walls and created plunge pools and teardrop-shaped ‚Äústreamlined islands‚Äù.Kathy Svitil, 06/20/10, Caltech Geologist Investigates Canyon Carved in Just Three Days in Texas Flood. Caltech Press Release. Although some of the geological formations present in the gorge are known to be associated with rapidly flowing flood water (such as the streamlined islands), other formations (such as the inner channels, knickpoints and terraces) have traditionally been interpreted through the ‚Äúlong ago and very slow‚Äù paradigm of geologic time in response to shifting climate or tectonic forcing. Typically, a steep-walled narrow gorge is inferred to represent slow persistent erosion, but because many of the geological formations of Canyon Lake Gorge are virtually indistinguishable from other formations which have been attributed to long term (slower) processes, the data collected from Canyon Lake Gorge lends further credence to the hypothesis that some of the most spectacular canyons on Earth may have been carved rapidly during ancient megaflood events. Additionally, because the flood conditions under which the gorge was formed are known, Canyon Lake Gorge provides a means of developing improved computer model reconstructions of pre-historic floods to determine water volume, flood duration and erosion rates.

Overview The squadron provides mission-ready personnel to operate and maintain the Alaskan Region Air Operations Center (RAOC) of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). It integrates fixed and airborne radar into the NORAD Global Command and Control System (NGCCS), and conducts 24-hour Alaskan NORAD Region (ANR) and Eleventh Air Force (11th AF) air sovereignty and theater air control operations. The 176th Air Defense Squadron is unique amongst the other American sectors in that it controls the only sector within its region, while the Eastern Air Defense Sector and Western Air Defense Sector both comprise the Continental NORAD Region (CONR). In addition to this distinction, it is the only sector that has regular reported intercepts of foreign military aircraft, with multiple intercepts of Russian Tu-95 \\"Bear\\" aircraft through its lifetime. History The 176th Air Defense Squadron traces its lineage, honors and history to Murphy Dome Air Force Station (AFS), (originally situated in a mountainous region known as the Yukon-Tanana Upland, 20 miles northwest of Fairbanks, Alaska). It was one of the ten original aircraft control and warning sites constructed during the early 1950s to establish a permanent air defense system in Alaska. Murphy Dome was initially operated by a detachment of the 532d Aircraft Control and Warning Group, Ladd Air Force Base (now Fort Wainwright). When the 532d was inactivated in 1951, the site was then operated by a detachment of the 13rd Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, Alaska Air National Guard. As part of HQ Alaskan Air Command's (HQ AAC) plan to upgrade all remote sites to full squadrons, the 744th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron (744th ACWS) was activated at Murphy Dome on 1 February 1953 with an authorized strength of 249 personnel. The mission of the 744th ACWS was to support, administer and train assigned personnel to perform air defense missions, support tactical missions as directed by HQ AAC, and operate and maintain the Murphy Dome AFS. In 1977, the 744th ACWS was assigned to the newly reactivated 531st Aircraft Control and Warning Group (531st ACWG). The 531 ACWG was later re-designated the 11th Tactical Control Group (11th TCG) in 1981. In the early 1980s, construction began on a new NORAD Region Operations Control Center (ROCC) at Elmendorf AFB, which would be responsible for managing all air defense operations in Alaska, making all manned remote radar sites redundant. The 744th ACWS was selected to man the ROCC, which achieved full operational status on 15 September 1983. All remote radar squadrons were inactivated by 1 November 1983. Under HQ Alaskan Air Command's SEEK IGLOO program, civilian manning at all remote radar sites was reduced to approximately four civilian personnel per site. In 1989, the 744th ACWS was aligned under the newly established 11th Tactical Control Wing (11 TCW). In 1992, this wing was renamed the 11th Air Control Wing (11 ACW), and the 744 ACWS was renamed the 744th Air Defense Squadron (744th ADS). The 11th ACW was reorganized on 1 July 1994 as the 611th Air Operations Group (611th AOG), and the 744th ADS was renamed the 611th Air Control Squadron (611th ACS). In 2001, the 611th ACS began a four-year transition to the Alaska Air National Guard. On 1 October 2004, the 611th ACS was officially inactivated and the 176th ACS was ceremonially recognized. Thus, the 176th ACS traces its heritage and honors from the original 744 ACWS/ADS, handed down over the past 50 years. In September 2013, the 176th ACS was re-designated as the 176th Air Defense Squadron (176th ADS). =Lineage= Emblem of the 744th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron. * Activated as 744th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, 1 February 1953 : Re-designated: 744th Air Defense Squadron, 1 October 1992 : Re-designated: 611th Air Control Squadron, 1 July 1994 : Inactivated on 1 October 2004 * Established as: 176th Air Control Squadron and allocated to Alaska ANG in 2004 : Received federal recognition on 1 October 2004, assuming personnel and equipment of 611th Air Control Squadron (Inactivated) : Re-Established as:176th Air Defense Squadron in August 2013.

Overview The name comes from the general crescent shape made by the four departments. The term media luna was coined soon after the election of Evo Morales to designate the mostly eastern-located departments that objected to the nationalization and redistribution of natural gas that is a major natural resource in the region and the policy of land reform that would be most vigorously enacted in those regions. The prefects of Santa Cruz, Beni, and Tarija elected in the December 2005 elections all hailed from Bolivian opposition parties. These governors formed the National Council for Democracy (CONALDE). In 2008, these departments were the major areas of violence between supporters of the national government and supporters of autonomy for the departments. The list of media luna departments was extended by some observers to include the departments of Cochabamba and Chuquisaca in 2007 and 2008. Cochabamba's prefect, Manfred Reyes Villa endorsed the other media luna governors' proposals for departmental autonomy. In June 2008, opposition member Savina Cu√©llar was elected as Prefect of Chuquisaca, marking a high point of opposition power. However in the 2008 recall referendum, Reyes Villa was recalled. In Chuquisaca as well as Tarija, Morales enjoyed majority support in the 2008 referendum only in the rural areas, while the capital cities (Sucre and Tarija respectively) had a majority for recalling Morales.Hans Zandvliet, Evoluci√≥n Electoral del MAS en Bolivia en las Elecciones y Refer√©ndums desde 2005 al 2009 .

Early life Adam Payne was born in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, United States in 1781 and moved to Ohio in 1799. Payne remained in Ohio for about 13 years, after which he emigrated to Kentucky. In 1820 he moved to Indiana, and his fascination with Illinois eventually led him to locate his family there. In the spring of 1831 he relocated to Illinois on a claim five miles (8 km) west of Holderman's Grove near the Fox River.Matson, Nehemiah. Memories of Shaubena, (Google Books), D.B. Cooke & Co.: 1878, pp. 194‚Äì204. Retrieved 4 October 2007. Description Adam Payne has been described as eccentric and talented in his work as a minister. Physical descriptions of Payne remarked on his long, jet, raven or crow black hair which flowed down onto and covered his broad shoulders. He was a large man who was described as imposing. He also wore a long beard, black like his hair, which was similar to a beard his brother, Aaron Payne, wore.http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84038582/1888-02-11/ed-1/seq-2/#date1=1789&index;=9&rows;=20&words;=Adam+Payne&searchType;=basic&sequence;=0&state;=&date2;=1924&proxtext;=Adam+Payne&y;=9&x;=9&dateFilterType;=yearRange&page;=1 His voice was powerful and booming, and contributed to his success as a preacher among the Native American tribes.Trask, Black Hawk: The Battle for the Heart of America, pp. 206 Ministerial career Payne was ordained an Elder in the Schwarzenau Brethren, known as the New Lights or Dunkers, but eventually dissolved his connections with any church to preach independently. He traveled the United States preaching mostly to large, outdoor crowds, following the model of Lorenzo Dow. During the summer 1830, Payne preached to several bands of Native Americans successfully. His success preaching among the Native Americans would make him less wary to travel into the frontier when the Black Hawk War started in 1832. Payne's oratory skill gained him notoriety throughout the United States. Death Two days after the May 21 Indian Creek massacre, the Payne was traveling by horseback on what would later become the Frank & Walker stagecoach route, from Chicago to Ottawa. Payne passed through several areas including Holderman's Grove, Lisbon and Plainfield, Illinois. At Plainfield Payne was met by a friend, Johnathan Wilson, who warned him of danger to individuals traveling the Illinois frontier alone. Payne was at first persuaded and turned back toward Chicago at Wilson's urgings.Armstrong, Perry A. The Sauks and the Black Hawk War (Google Books), H.W. Rokker: 1887, pp. 399‚Äì403. Retrieved 4 October 2007. As he traveled toward Chicago, Payne changed his mind, ignored the warnings and turned back toward Ottawa. Payne's journey was uneventful until he approached Holderman's Grove. Payne approached the grove, about halfway between Plainfield and Ottawa, when he was ambushed by a waiting war party of Native Americans. Based on later Native American summaries of the attack on Payne it is likely that it was carried out by the same band responsible for the Indian Creek massacre. They immediately fired their weapons and Payne was wounded through the chest. He turned his horse to flee but it was also wounded in the encounter and after a chase of about it fell dead beneath him. Unarmed, Payne was overtaken by the attackers and purportedly decapitated. However, one witness to the body's discovery indicated that he was only scalped and his head remained attached to his body.Blanchard, Rufus. Discovery and Conquests of the North-west, with the History of Chicago, (Google Books), R. Blanchard: 1881, pp. 380‚Äì81. Retrieved 6 October 2007. In the index to his 2006 book, Black Hawk: The Battle for the Heart of America, Kerry A. Trask refers to the incident as the Holderman's Grove raid.Trask, Black Hawk: The Battle for the Heart of America, pp. 360‚Äì61. Another 1887 account also indicates Payne was decapitated, emphasizing that while his head was placed on a stake in the ground, his scalp remained untouched. In his 1878 work, Memories of Shaubena, also describes a decapitation. Matson states that after the head was severed the band returned to their camp, head in tow. Upon returning to the camp the band placed the head on the stake, as described by Trask and others, and began dancing around the war trophy. The leader of the band, Mike Girty, was away from the camp with a group of scouts at the time, when he returned he noticed the head on the stake and first assumed it to be a woman. He examined it further, realized it was his old friend Adam Payne, and was immediately overcome with grief and anger. He tried to attack Payne's assailant with a tomahawk but was prevented from doing so by others in the group. Notes References *Trask, Kerry A.

Starting from 2009 Otterlei also began to write concert music for orchestra, concert band and other ensembles. Although considered mainly autodidact, Otterlei was later on mentored by Hans Lamal and prominent composer Luc van Hove.  Style  Best described as neo-tonal, Otterlei does not shun recognizable melodies. He employs modern as well as traditional harmonies, integrating consonance and dissonance in a fluid and logical way.

In 1990 he was voted American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt after winning the Breeders' Cup Juvenile. Background Bred by Kip and Suzanne Knelman's Farfellow Farms near Paris, Kentucky, he was out of the unraced mare Ivory Idol, a daughter of U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee, Alydar. He was sired by Unbridled, the 1990 American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse who won the Kentucky Derby and the Breeders' Cup Classic. He was acquired by The Thoroughbred Corp., the racing stable owned by Prince Ahmed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia and named for the 19th century Indian poet Mir Babar Ali Anis. Anees was trained by Alex Hassinger, Jr. Racing career Anees and sent to the track in 1999 at age two. Of his four starts he notably won a maiden race and finished third behind winner Dixie Union and runner-up Forest Camp in the Norfolk Stakes at Santa Anita Park. A late developer, the colt had matured considerably by the time he was entered in November's Breeders' Cup Juvenile. Up against thirteen colts that included the two who had beaten him in the Norfolk Stakes, Anees was sent off by pari-mutuel bettors at odds of 30:1. Under jockey Gary Stevens, Anees put on a powerful show of running, coming from last to first in winning the Juvenile by 2¬Ω lengths. His performance was sufficient to earn him the 1999 Eclipse Award for American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt. Sent back to the track at age three, Anees finished thirteenth behind winner Fusaichi Pegasus in the 2000 Kentucky Derby. Of his three starts that year, his best result was a third-place finish in the early fall to winner Fusaichi Pegasus in the San Felipe Stakes. Stud record Retired to stud duty at Mill Ridge Farm near Lexington, Kentucky, Anees sired a number of horses and appeared to have excellent stallion potential until a paddock accident on March 31, 2003. Anees fractured his left front pastern and underwent emergency surgery at the renowned Hagyard Equine Medical Institute. The operation left him in a body sling with a full cast on his left pastern that went all the way up to the shoulder. The extensive efforts to save him came to naught and Anees had to be euthanized on April 5, 2003.

Card and discounts  The card is available as a one-year validity card for ¬£20 and as a three-year validity card for ¬£54. The Railcard holder can take another adult with them at the same discount rate. All franchised train operating companies in Great Britain must accept the Railcard and offer discounts under terms set out in the Railways Act 1993. The Railcard is managed by Rail Delivery Group. It is aimed at people who have the most difficulty using rail for a reason relating to their disability. Its purpose is to encourage people to use the train and to reduce the cost for those who need to be accompanied by a carer.  Origins  British Rail (BR) introduced the Disabled Persons Railcard in 1981 to mark the International Year of Disabled Persons. Sir Peter Parker was Chairman of BR at the time and the British Railways Board included Tom Libby and wheelchair user Bill Buchanan, who was \\"Special Adviser on the Disabled\\". Tom Libby and Bill Buchanan together with Sir Bert Massie (RADAR) were tasked to design and develop the Disabled Persons Railcard. The basic rules of the Railcard were originally jotted down on a beer mat when Tom Libby and Sir Bert Massie had gone for a drink one evening after work. At the time, when the Railcard was in the early stages, Tom Libby and Sir Bert Massie did not know which British Rail department would be dealing with the developments, so they temporarily named it Dept XXX. For many years after the Railcard's launch, applications had to be sent to Dept XXX, British Rail. The Railcard initially cost ¬£5. Its price increased to ¬£14 in the 1990s and then in 2006 to ¬£18. A three-year Railcard was also introduced in September 2006 at ¬£48. The price increased again in January 2011, to its current cost of ¬£20 for a year. The three year railcard was increased the same year, costing ¬£54. (¬£18 per year). these prices are still in effect.  Qualifying disabilities  Applicants must submit evidence to show that their disability makes them eligible for a Disabled Persons Railcard. This includes having visual and hearing impairments, epilepsy or a number of allowances available to disabled people. Current eligibility criteria are shown on the Disabled Persons Railcard website.  Disabled people and trains  Historically, the design of most British trains did not enable wheelchair users to travel in the main passenger area. Passenger doors were too narrow and the fixed seating layout did not give wheelchair users space to manoeuvre. When wheelchair users could travel by rail, it was in the guard‚Äôs van. The introduction of High Speed Trains and sliding door carriages in the 1970s and 1980s, did much to improve access for disabled passengers, especially with wider doors and priority seating giving people more leg room. The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 introduced design standards for the future design and construction of public transport vehicles. So, in November 1998 the Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations were introduced. These had a significant impact on the design of new trains and refurbishment of existing ones. Rail Vehicle Regulations also formed the basis of the TSI-PRM, a European standard for heavy rail vehicles accessibility.  Issuing the Disabled Persons Railcard  The Disabled Persons Railcard was first issued from an administration office at York station. Initially, issuing was a manual procedure as there were no computers. This continued until rail privatisation in the mid-1990s, when issuing work was taken over by a British Telecom office at Newcastle ‚Äì a computerised database was introduced, although ticket issuing remained a manual process. In 2008, issuing arrangements moved to Scottish contact centre operator, Journeycall, based in Brechin, Angus, and Laurencekirk, Aberdeenshire. This move also saw the introduction of automated ticket issuing systems and increased call centre opening hours (available between 07.00 and 22.00 every day except Christmas Day). In 2014, Journeycall moved from its Brechin and Laurencekirk offices to a new contact centre at Arbroath in Angus. Each application form is checked to ensure correct qualification, with renewal reminders issued to Railcard holders.  Numbers of holders  Since its 1981 launch over a million Disabled Persons Railcards have been issued, with the millionth issued in 2008. Currently, there are over 190,000 Disabled Persons Railcard holders, with a goal of expanding numbers further to enable as many disabled people (and accompanying companions) as possible to travel through Great Britain at a discount rate.  Marketing the Disabled Persons Railcard  Management and marketing of the Railcard is led by the Disability & Inclusion and National Railcards teams at Rail Delivery Group in London.

He was a leading American two-year-old in 1992, and at the end of the season was voted American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt at the Eclipse Awards. His subsequent racing career was curtailed by injury. Background Bred by Harry T. Mangurian Jr., he was out of the mare Gilded Lilly and sired by Timeless Moment, a son of the U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee, Damascus.

Trained by Bobby Barnett, at age two Answer Lively made seven starts, winning four and finishing second once. He won the Sport of Kings Futurity at Louisiana Downs and was second in the Breeders' Futurity Stakes at Keeneland Race Course before capturing the most important win of his career. The colt gave owner John Franks his first ever Breeders' Cup winner when jockey Jerry Bailey rode him to victory in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile. His 1998 performances earned Answer Lively the Eclipse Award as the American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt. At age three, Answer Lively raced seven more times, earning three seconds but without a win. In that year's Kentucky Derby he finished tenth then started two more times before being injured. After an eight-month layoff, in June 2000 his owner announced the colt was being retired from racing due to a hairline fracture to a sesamoid in his left front leg. Under a partnership agreement with the Hill 'n' Dale Farms Lexington, Kentucky breeding farm, he was to stand there at stud in 2001. However, fertility problems led to Answer Lively being treated at John Franks Southland Division near Ocala, Florida. Unsuccessful, he was pensioned without ever siring any offspring and sent to live at Twin Oaks Farm near Murchison, Texas. In October 2003, Answer Lively's owner announced that the seven-year-old horse had died of a heart attack nearly six months earlier on April 28, 2003 and was buried at Twin Oaks.

Publication history Scaleface first appeared in X-Factor vol. 1 #11 (December 1986), and was created by Louise Simonson and Walter Simonson. The character subsequently appears as a zombie in Sensational She- Hulk #34-35 (December 1991-January 1992). Fictional character biography After the Morlock Massacre storyline, Scaleface, Blowhard, Berzerker and Masque, part of The Tunnelers came up on Iceman and Beast. They incorrectly believe that the two X-Men were threatening Leech and Caliban. A fight breaks out, with Leech neutralizing the powers on both sides. Eventually the group calms down, with the urging of Scaleface. As a group, they join with the remnants of X-Factor and make their way to safety. It almost goes badly as Thor's funeral pyre for the dead Morlocks nearly roasts Scaleface and all of her old and new allies. Dissatisfied with the possibilities at X-Factor's HQ, they sneak out, disguised and claiming to be the X-Factor 'cleaning staff'. Scaleface urges restraint in this escape, not wanting to kill. Attempting to simply go home, they stumble upon the Savage Wolf gang. When it is clear they are mutants, the gang opens fire, killing Blow-Hard and wounding Masque. The confrontation swiftly escalates, leading to a cordon by the police. Again, Scaleface urges restraint, explaining how the cops simply want to defend their own, like the Morlocks have. Scaleface transforms in front of the cops, who frightened, open fire, killing her. Berzerker goes mad, deciding to kill every human who hates mutants. Cyclops confronts him and in the fight, Berzerker vanishes below the water, seemingly destroyed by his own powers.X-Factor #11 Scaleface was later resurrected as a zombie by the Black Talon as part of the X-Humed along with other dead mutants Changeling, Living Diamond and Harry Leland to fight She-Hulk.

Moore, and several smaller stores. History Severna Park Mall opened as a small, local mall in 1975 with Grant City and Giant Food. The Grant City store was short-lived, with Woolco taking its place after one year; after Woolco's closure in 1982, this space was occupied by Caldor. Other stores included Pixie Pizza, Horn and Horn Smorgasbord, Buffy's Yummys, JJ's Records, Dan's Barbershop, Joanne Fabrics, Sidle's Jean Scene, Jason's Pianos, G Briggs, Greene's Jewelers, a Hallmark store, a hair salon, and the restaurant Kona Tiki. However, as with most smaller regional malls, Severna Park Mall started to decline. Caldor closed in September 1989 after failing to reach a lease agreement with the mall's management, re-opened in October 1991, but closed for good when the entire chain liquidated in 1999. After being mainly an empty mall in the 1990s, Severna Park Mall was largely demolished; only the former Caldor building remained, with Kohl's moving into this building shortly afterward.

Biography  Dai Fujikura was born in 1977 in Osaka, Japan. He moved to London when he was 15 to study at Dover College as a music scholar to complete his secondary education. His initial ambition was to compose music for cinema. Studying the music of Pierre Boulez, Gy√∂rgy Ligeti and T≈çru Takemitsu at Trinity College of Music provoked a gestalt shift: Dai became an aspiring contemporary composer whose extensive knowledge of cinematography gave his music a fresh, individual voice. Imagining sounds as image produced music with considerable dramatic structure and strength. By the end of his second year he had already won the Serocki International Composers Competition. Before graduating, Dai's music had been broadcast on many European radio stations, won several other prizes, and had been performed by a list of illustrious ensembles and soloists including: Orkest de Volharding, the London Sinfonietta, Colin Currie and Harry Sparnaay. Despite this fortuitous start, and the strength of early works such as Frozen Heat, Cari4nics and Eternal Escape, Dai wanted to develop his technique. A visit to Darmstadt, where he first heard Japanese traditional music, and a Masters with Edwin Roxburgh at the Royal College of Music helped Dai embrace this musical heritage, composing works like Okeanos Breeze for a mix of Japanese and Western Instruments. Whilst at the RCM he was also mentored by P√©ter E√∂tv√∂s, writing Fifth Station for the London Sinfonietta. This period denotes an important phase in the development of Dai's music. He experiments with spatial separation, a technique where he breaks up the traditional seating of the orchestra, sometimes placing them around the auditorium for both aural and dramatic effect. The first orchestral work using this technique was Calling Timbuktu (2nd prize Takemitsu Competition 2003) has been performed by the Tokyo Philharmonic and BBC Symphony Orchestras. Also he starts to experiment with video, writing teki and moromoro for solo piano and film. Research into spatial separation, and cinematographic musical structures continued at King's College London under George Benjamin, leading to a PhD. A portrait concert by the Philharmonia Orchestra (part of the RFH Music of Today series with Martyn Brabbins), retrospectives in New York and Chicago, work with Ensemble Modern, Klangforum Wien, and a subsequent major commission for Vast Ocean at Donaueshingen Music Days with Eotvos launched Dai as a major new voice of the European avant-garde. Pierre Boulez, with whom he first worked whilst writing Stream State for Orchestra (Premiered at the Lucerne Festival, and receiving five other performances in 2006 alone) was a major supporter of his work: Dai was one of only two people asked to write a piece for the official Boulez 80th birthday celebrations at Cite de la Musique (Code 80). Subsequent commissions include two pieces for Ensemble Intercontemperain, (one celebrating their 30th birthday), a new work for twelve percussionists for the 2006 Lucerne Festival, a major orchestral and electronic work commissioned by IRCAM and Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France, and a piano concerto for Noriko Ogawa and the Philharmonia Orchestra.

It connects to the East Falls to the Port Richmond, and runs primarily along Allegheny Avenue. Route description The route starts at a loop in the vicinity of 35th Street and Allegheny Avenue. It is a route shared with the SEPTA Route 1 and Route R bus lines until it reaches the five-way intersection between US 13 (West Hunting Park Avenue) and Henry Avenue, where the two bus lines move away from Allegheny Avenue and go northeast on US 13. Also near the intersection are Mercy Vocational High School as well as SEPTA Route 32 and the northern terminus of SEPTA Route 48. Continuing eastbound, Route 60 encounters the intersection of 22nd Street which leads to Allegheny Regional Railroad Station on the Manayunk/Norristown Line. It is one of three stations named after the street that carries most of Route 60. Both the Manayunk/Norristown and the Chestnut Hill West Line cross over Allegheny Avenue and Route 60 at the northeast corner of 21st Street. After the two bridges, it enters the Allegheny West neighborhood, skipping past 20th and 19th Streets, before passing under the Lansdale/Doylestown Line between North Broad and Wayne Junction stations. Route 60 provides no access to this line, but at the intersection with Broad Street it does allow access to Allegheny station on the Broad Street Subway Line, which is the second SEPTA station to be named after the street. Immediately after the intersection with Germantown Avenue and the SEPTA Route 23 line, the Trenton Line interrupts Allegheny Avenue, forcing Route 60 northeast onto Sedgley Avenue. Sedgley runs along the north side of the Trenton Line until it reaches Erie Avenue, which carries the SEPTA Route 56 line. Allegheny Avenue resumes at the eastern terminus of Westmoreland Avenue and southern terminus of 9th Street, then goes south under the Trenton Line until it reaches Glenwood Avenue, which runs along the South Side of the Trenton Line. After Glenwood, Allegheny Avenue and Route 60 resume their previous alignment. When Route 60 meets Kensington Avenue beneath Allegheny station along the Market-Frankford Line in Harrowgate, Allegheny Avenue ends its run as an east-west road, and turns southeast-to-northwest. This is the third and last station to be named after the street. The next major intersection along the route is Frankford Avenue, which the Market-Frankford Line runs above northeast of this intersection. In between Frankford and Aramingo Avenues, Route 60 passes by Northeastern Hospital. Most Route 60 buses make a left turn onto Richmond Street and terminate at the Richmond-Westmoreland Loop, which is also the eastern terminus for SEPTA Route 15. Limited service south of Richmond Street exists across I-95 to Delaware Avenue and the Tioga Marine Terminal, then north to Lewis Street across I-95 again, and back west on Richmond Street to Richmond- Westmoreland Loop. History The Allegheny Avenue trolley was established in 1906 and ran between Richmond Street and 17th Street. In 1910 the line was extended west to Ridge Avenue, partially on Lehigh Avenue between 17th and 21st Streets (past the site of Shibe Park, the 1909 home of the Philadelphia Athletics). Between 1923 and 1939, Philadelphia Rapid Transit (PRT) Route 60 was split with an extension from 21st Street and Ridge Avenue known as Route 60A, while Route 60 itself ran between 21st Street and Richmond Avenue.1974 SEPTA Trolley History Brochure This discontinuity of Route 60 between 17th and 21st Streets existed in order to avoid crossing three different railroad lines at grade between those streets that were present when the trolley line was first established in 1906: the Reading Railroad's Ninth Street Branch (now part of SEPTA's Main Line), the Chestnut Hill Branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad, and the Reading's Norristown Branch, in westward succession, all featuring extremely heavy passenger traffic. The crossings of the first two lines were eliminated in 1911 and 1916, but the latter one, which crossed at a hazardous acute angle (and was electrified in 1933) remained until 1939. In that year, trolley tracks were finally installed between 17th and 21st as the Reading completed a project grade-separating the branch (now SEPTA's Manayunk/Norristown Line) over Allegheny, 21st and 22nd Streets through the neighborhood. Unlike the vast majority of trolley routes in Philadelphia, Route 60 never utilized either the 1,500 single-ended Nearside cars or the 535 8000-series Peter Witt cars, and was operated with double-ended cars by PRT and successor Philadelphia Transportation Company until 1956. On February 24 of that year, a loop was constructed at 35th and Allegheny, and the line's eastern terminus was soon changed from the Richmond & Allegheny crossover to the adjacent Richmond & Westmoreland loop used by Route 15, thus allowing Route 60 to be assigned PCC cars cascaded from Callowhill Depot. These cars, idle during the summer when schools were out, would no longer be needed at Callowhill due to the impending bus conversion of Route 42 and the rerouting of Route 13 into the subway, events which occurred simultaneously over the weekend of September 8‚Äì9. Richmond Depot, which had housed the cars that served Route 60 up until this point in time, was closed, and the PCC cars used on the line operated out of Luzerne Depot for the remainder of its existence as a trolley route. SEPTA replaced the trolleys on Route 60 with buses on September 4, 1977, the first trolley line abandoned in the city since Route 47 in 1969. A shortage of operable trolley cars had plagued SEPTA since the disastrous Woodland depot fire in fall 1975; although 30 used PCCs from Toronto, Ontario were subsequently purchased (and used on routes such as the 60), some of these cars had major end-of-life issues, while SEPTA's maintenance of its existing trolley fleet remained abysmal. Route 60 remained physically intact until a 1983 water main replacement near the intersection of Kensington and Allegheny avenues occasioned the removal of track; the Philadelphia Water Department was told by SEPTA management that the trackage would not be used again, and thus did not replace it.Philadelphia Trolley Routes by the Numbers The overhead was soon removed as well, and the rest of the tracks were paved over by the end of the decade. Currently, there are no indications that SEPTA has any plans to restore the trolleys along Route 60. The route (along with all SEPTA fixed bus routes) is ADA-compliant, and the buses contain bicycle racks. The line is one of SEPTA's \\"Night Owl\\" routes.

It is operated by the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. The line runs between the Tioga and Tacony neighborhoods primarily along Erie Avenue and Torresdale Avenue. Route 56 was one of three \\"suspended\\" by the SEPTA board effective June 12, 1992. The two others, Routes 15 and 23, were then also operated by buses as of the same year; however, the Route 15 Trolley has since been restored back to trolley as of September 5, 2005. Route description Route 56 begins at West Hunting Park Avenue and 23rd Street, better known as the Venango Street Loop. Five blocks later at Pulaski Avenue, SEPTA Route 53 joins Route 56 along Erie Avenue. Route 53 is another former streetcar line that was converted into a bus route. Both routes intersect with Broad Street and connect to Erie Station on the Broad Street Subway Line, as well as Germantown Avenue, which carries Route 23. Route 53 leaves Erie Avenue at 10th Street turning north toward Luzerne Carhouse, while Route 56 continues towards its eastbound destination. Route 53's original terminus was the Luzerne Carhouse, which was shared by Route 56 for storage. East of Sedgley Avenue near 2nd Street, Route 56 runs parallel to the Trenton Line on the line's north side. The east corners of the intersection of Front Street, contain sites such as St. Christopher's Hospital and a local ball park known as Lighthouse Field. When Route 56 meets Erie-Torresdale Station at Kensington Avenue in Juniata Park, Erie Avenue turns into Torresdale Avenue. The station is an elevated section of the Market-Frankford Line above Kensington Avenue. East of the station, a loop for Route 56 exists on the south side of the intersections of East Hunting Park Avenue and Frankford Avenue, which includes bridges over Tacony Creek for Torresdale and Frankford Avenues. While most of Erie Avenue and Torresdale Avenue between Kensington and Frankford Avenues contain visible signs of the former streetcar line within the pavement, east of this loop few remnants of the former trolley line remain. South of the line, Bridge Street and Harbison Avenue both lead to Bridesburg (SEPTA station) and I-95, although Harbison Avenue is better able to handle the traffic. Robbins and Levick Streets lead to and from the Tacony- Palmyra Bridge as do two streets at the terminus of the line. Disston Street is an otherwise non-notable residential street that leads to Tacony (SEPTA station). Prior to the line's eastern terminus, Torresdale Avenue becomes part of eastbound PA 73, which turns onto southbound Princeton Avenue on its way to I-95 and the Tacony-Palmyra Bridge. The line finally ends at the Torresdale- Cottman Loop, on the corner of Torresdale and Cottman Avenues, where the eastbound and westbound sections of PA 73 merge. History Route 56 was established in 1907 and originally ran from the intersection of West Hunting Park Avenue and Pulaski Avenue then down Pulaski to Erie where it ended at 2nd Street. As with all trolleys in Philadelphia, its rail gauge was . In 1926, the western terminus was moved to its present location; in 1928, the eastern terminus was moved northeast to the Torresdale-Cottman Loop. In March 1941, the line was re-equipped with PCC cars, which provided all trolley service until 1992. Southbound Route 56 PCC car on Torresdale Avenue in July, 1968 Route 56 was suspended as a trolley in 1992, and replaced by bus service, along with Route 23. During 1994, fan trips were provided by Brill Built #8534 & Kawasaki LRV #9111 trolleys, revealing dedicated lanes on Erie, such as the right-of-way on Toronto's 512 St. Clair line. In 1997, SEPTA attempted to make this suspension permanent, but cancelled the proposal after public outcry from commuters. As of 2009, all buses are compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and contain bicycle racks. \\"Night Owl\\" service is also available.SEPTA Route 56 official map and schedule In 2014, SEPTA general manager Joe Casey stated in an interview that there are currently no plans to restore trolley routes 23 and 56 due to the need to address SEPTA's backlog of deferred State of Good Repair projects for the system. However, SEPTA's Subway-Surface Trolley replacement project will include studying the possibility of restoring route 56 as well as routes 23 and 45 to light rail.http://septa.org/strategic-plan/reports/FY-2018-Capital-Budget- and%20FY-2018-2029%20Capital-Program.pdf References External links *SEPTA Route 56 (Official Map and Schedule) *Former SEPTA Route 56 Trolley (World-NYC-Subway.org) *1974 SEPTA Trolley History Brochure 56 56 Category:Tram routes in Philadelphia Category:Transportation in Philadelphia Category:Streetcars in Pennsylvania Category:Railway lines opened in 1907 Category:Railway lines closed in 1992 ","title":"SEPTA Route 56"},{"id":"13599907","text":"Route 75 is a trackless trolley route operated by SEPTA in North and Northeast Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.

Development and sales of Adobe Flash Catalyst ended on April 23, 2012.  Features  With Flash Catalyst, user interface architects can create the user interface for Adobe Flex (now Adobe Flash Builder 4) applications using Adobe graphics software. Then developers can use the result to build the rest of the application in Flex. Flash Catalyst can import Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Fireworks, or Flash XML Graphics (FXG) files keeping all their features. The converted artwork can then be used as functional UI components (creating Flex component skins). After importing, users use simple WYSIWYG techniques to create and edit behaviors (mouse event handling, etc.) without writing code and create animated transitions. Flash Catalyst can also use design-time data placeholders when marking up an application, testing interactivity, and choreographing motion. These placeholders can then be replaced at production-time with final artwork. This same method can be used to create UIs to handle dynamic data without having access to the actual data source. Imported objects are maintained as linked files, so behaviors created in Flash Catalyst are still maintained even after the original file is edited in its originating program (e.g., Photoshop or Illustrator). Flash Catalyst is also compatible with Adobe Flash Builder (formerly called \\"Flex Builder\\"), using the same project format. In addition to its primary function of being a GUI composer for Adobe Flex components, Flash Catalyst also features a basic code workspace, which consists of a subset of Adobe Flash Builder's panels. Both tools being based on Eclipse, the code editor, project navigator and problems view are basically the same in both products. Thus for a simple project Flash Catalyst may even be used as the sole software for the entire authoring/programming steps.

She is best known for large scale murals and has painted more than fifty murals internationally, including several of the largest murals in the United States. The artist is known for mixing classical and contemporary aspects of painting, and for her community centered process. Saligman's seminal murals were painted in the late 1990s-early 2000s are credited as exceptionally influential to the contemporary mural movement. Her work resides as permanent public art all over the world, but is also part of private collections including the Johnson and Johnson works on paper collection and the Rutgers University Museum of Fine Arts print collection.  Early life and education  Saligman grew up in the small town of Olean, New York. In high school she helped to paint one of the murals in Olean. Saligman's first independent mural was painted on the front of a sweater factory that no longer exists. It was owned by a man that is now her husband. She attended Washington University where she earned a degree in painting.  Art  Saligman is known for mixing classical and contemporary painting techniques with an emphasis on figurative compositions with abstract accents. Her practice is focused on community, collaboration, and site specificity. Saligman‚Äôs process often relates to themes of social practice in contemporary art, with the idea that exchange is essential between the viewer or participant, the artist, and the artwork.  Notable works  Saligman's public art can be divided into three distinct, but related, bodies of work: large-scale exterior murals, hybrid interior/exterior projects, and installations. Murals Common Threads (1998) * We Will Not Be Satisfied Until (2015) * Water Tower, Water Tale (2013) * Hues of the Heart (2012) * Magic Hour (2012) * The Evolving Faces of Nursing (2010) * Fertile Ground (2009) * Passing Through (2004) * Theater of Life (2002) * Once in a Millennium Moon (2000) * Common Threads (1998) Saligman's best known mural is Common Threads located in Philadelphia. It is painted on the west wall of the old Thaddeus Stevens School of Observation at the corner of Broad and Spring Garden streets. The mural uses portraiture of local high school students alongside antique dolls owned by Saligman's grandmother to commentate on shared humanity. Other murals include Philadelphia Muses on 13th and Locust streets, a multimedia Theatre of Life on Broad and Lombard streets, Passing Through over the Schuylkill Expressway, and the paint and LED light installation at Broad and Vine streets, Evolving Face of Nursing. Saligman's work can be viewed nationally in Shreveport, Louisiana, with Once in a Millennium Moon, and in Omaha, Nebraska, with Fertile Ground. Saligman's latest work, The MLK Mural: We Will Not be Satisfied Until on MLK Boulevard in Chattanooga, TN. The mural is the largest mural in the Southeastern United States as well as one of the five largest murals in the United States. Architecturally integrated works * Woven Sanctuary (2015) * Water, Earth, Fire (2014) * Safety Net (2012) * The Mustard Tree (2011) Saligman has a long standing collaboration with the non- profit Project HOME, creating and integrating art within new subsidized housing units. This body of work explores the meaning of home with new residents who have experienced homelessness in Philadelphia. Saligman‚Äôs use of stained glass, fountain features, and light installation is noted for elevating the perception of subsidized housing. Installations * Our Common Ground - Vote for the Good Life (2016) * Knotted Grotto (2015) The public installation Knotted Grotto was a commission for Pope Francis' visit to Philadelphia and the World Meeting of Families in 2015 Located at the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul, this artwork directly included over 150,000 public participants in its creation.  Mural cloth technique  Saligman invented the ‚Äúcommunity paint day‚Äù in 2001 as a way to include thousands of community members in the making of Once in a Millennium Moon. The technique is now widespread across the mural industry. Participants paint a portion of a mural on non-woven cloth which is subsequently installed onto the mural wall using Novagel for permanent adherence. Awards and honors Saligman was named one of the most influential American muralists by Public Art Review and has been recognized by The New York Times, artnet, The Wall Street Journal, NPR, the National Endowment for the Arts, Art in America, the Smithsonian Institution, and numerous others. In 2006 Saligman Received Philadelphia‚Äôs Visionary Artist Award from the City of Philadelphia Mural Arts Program. She also received the Visionary Woman Award by the Moore College of Art in 2016. Personal life Saligman resides in Philadelphia.

He worked as a minor sports coach and physical education instructor while in college. He also played football for Santa Clara. After graduating law school, Thomas did not open his own practice, but found a job in a fish processing factory that was owned by Martin J. Bogdanovich, a fellow Croatian from the Island of Vis. While with the factory, Thomas was encouraged to engage himself in politics. Political career Thomas entered politics and was successful in his first run for office in 1940, resoundingly defeating Charles M.

History and facilities The name Colby is of Scandinavian origin and is derived from Kolli's Farm which was home to the lexicographer, Archibald Cregeen (1774‚Äì1841). The word Colby is thought to derive from the Viking words Col (meaning Hill) and Byr (meaning farm). The village has a railway station on the Isle of Man Steam Railway and is home to Colby Glen, one of the seventeen National Manx Glens. The village is home to Colby Football Club who play in the Isle of Man Football League and are based at Station Road. Methodism Colby has long been associated with Methodism. John Wesley preached at Balladoole in 1781, invited to do so by a local family. The first Methodist preacher arrived in the village in 1822 and a local house was set up as the Preaching House for Primitive Methodists. By 1883 two Methodist chapels were built, Colby Primitive Methodist Chapel on Main Road which closed in 1950, when the two chapels united and is now a private house.

Any individual male of the branch must be named Cornelius Scipio and a female Cornelia. The nomen, Cornelius, signifies that the person belongs to the Cornelia gens, a legally defined clan composed of many familiae. The cognomen, Scipio, identifies the line, or branch within the clan. Other branches had other cognomina; during the Republic there were no Cornelii who did not belong to some branch of the ancient clan. As branches developed, each was identified by its own agnomen, such as Africanus. The formal names of the Cornelii were thus at least two names long; in the late Republic, three or more. Individual names, or praenomina, offered but little more variation. Of 18 patrician praenomina, each clan preferred a limited repertory. The Cornelii Scipiones used only three: Gnaeus (CN.), Lucius (L.) and Publius (P.), as a glance at the list of males names below will confirm. In written records it was typically necessary to distinguish the individual with the name of a relative; for men, usually the father (patronymic). The patronymic appeared typically as initials of the relative inserted after the nomen with F. for filius (\\"son\\") or N. for nepos (\\"grandson\\"): Lucius Cornelius P. f. Scipio, \\"Lucius Cornelius Scipio son of Publius.\\" Although the Romans used Scipiones (in only a few known literary instances) as a plural to mean more than one Scipio, they customarily preferred Scipionarius or Scipioneus to refer to \\"a Scipio\\" or the plural of those words for \\"the Scipios.\\" The poets however preferred the honorific Greek patronymic form, Scipiades or Scipiadas in the singular, Scipiadae in the plural (which scans better as poetry: Sc√≠p«ê«éd√°e), in deference to the well- known Scipionic predilection for Hellenica. The family =Social context= The proper noun, Scƒ´pio, is identical to the Latin common noun (and only to that noun) for \\"staff\\" in the sense of sceptre or formal baton, a badge of governmental authority. The word is native Latin, deriving from Indo- European *skei-p-, \\"cut\\" (a staff is a cutting from wood). That the ancients understood the name to mean that is proved by a decree from Delos engraved on a stele about 193 BC, which thanks Publius Cornelius P. f. Scipio for his donation to the temple there and grants him a laurel crown. On the stele appear representations of the crown and a knotty staff. The Cornelii Scipiones first appear in Roman history in 396 BC in the context of the destruction of Veii by Marcus Furius Camillus, who on being appointed Dictator selected Publius Cornelius Scipio as his \\"Master of Knights\\"; that is, his cavalry commander. Scipio subsequently served as military tribune, in essence a general. Already the Scipiones were a distinguished branch of one of the most powerful patrician families ‚Äì the gens Cornelia. The use of the cognomen dates to the Roman Republic: the kings and their contemporaries had two names only, or earlier one. The first Scipio and the event leading to the branch name remain obscure.Late imperial and mediaeval etymologists, such as Macrobius and Isidore of Seville, repeated the story without source or evidence that an early Cornelius was given the name because he was a \\"staff\\" in helping his blind father walk in the senate-house. Other writers have attributed the name to various Scipios anachronistically, such as Africanus, who were a \\"staff\\" to the state. The poets compared the name to various Greek words for cudgel or lightning bolt with reference to Scipionic victories or to bristling trees bringing horror (\\"bristling\\") to the battlefield. The family was one of the most distinguished of the republic. At least fifteen members became consuls, some re-elected many times, between 350 BC and 111 BC. Their family tomb, dated to the 3rd century BC and rediscovered in 1780, contained one of the earliest collections of Latin inscriptions, the elogia Scipionum (\\"inscriptions of the Scipiones\\"), an important historical source for the Roman Republic. =Political context= The Cornelii Scipiones were one of the main politically active patrician families contesting for high office in the Roman Republic. Their rise was phenomenal; in the fourth century BC, they held only one consulship; in the third century BC, they held eight consulships (and produced six consuls including Scipio Africanus). By the late second century BC, the Scipiones were traditional political allies of the Paulii branch of the Aemilius family, and intermarried with them at least once. When the most distinguished branch became extinct in the male line circa 170 BC, it survived a further generation by adopting an Aemilius Paullus (the future Scipio Aemilianus) into the Scipionic stemline. Before and during the Second Punic War, the Scipiones struggled to get their views heard in preference to that of conservatives such as Quintus Fabius Maximus (head of the gens Fabia). The Scipiones and their allies, including the Aemilii, were said to favor war and expansionism; the Fabii, with their allies the Manlii, favored conservatism. The political differences gradually widened to include military differences; the brothers Scipio (who fell in Spain) sought to carry the war into Carthaginian territory, an idea backed by Scipio Africanus a few years later. The Scipiones are also believed to have been behind the election of Gaius Terentius Varro, which led indirectly to the disastrous defeat at Cannae survived by Africanus, then a very young commander. The conquests of grandfather and adoptive grandson marked the end of an era, and the decline or demise of the Middle Republic. The two Scipiones, by destroying Carthage militarily and physically (on orders from the Senate), ensured that Rome had no major threat to her expansion around the Mediterranean. Another Scipio (Scipio Nasica) had opposed any further war with Carthage, arguing that Rome needed a strong rival to keep her older values. =Cultural context= The Scipiones were also famous for their interest in the Hellenistic way of life. Scipio Africanus was criticized by many in the Senate for his love of luxury and his Greek style of wearing the toga. Yet it was he and his friends who introduced the idea of formally educating women and children in Greek. They also spearheaded a luxurious style of living, with Africanus building an immense house on the Forum itself (subsequently rebuilt by his son-in-law into the Basilica Sempronia). Scipio is said to have introduced orange trees (from Iberia) to Rome, and also brought many rare flowering plants to Rome from Africa. Scipio Aemilianus was famous for his Scipionic Circle, a group of scholars and philosophers that he gathered around him in his house in Rome. He was a patron and friend of the historian Polybius, the grammarian Lucilius, the playwright Terence, and others.

At the height of its power it was one of the wealthiest and most influential in Bavaria.Kl√∂ster in Bayern: Niederm√ºnster, Regensburg The church is still in use as the parish church of Regensburg Cathedral. History This women's religious community, dedicated to Saint Erhard of Regensburg at its founding and later to the Assumption of the Virgin Mary as well, was recorded for the first time in about 889. However, the first church, if the traditional foundation by the seventh-century Saint Erhard is credited, would have already existed by about 700, and a religious community had been founded by 788 by Tassilo III, Duke of Bavaria. The foundation tradition also credits Saint Erhard with the foundation of a nunnery here. It is not clear in fact whether at first the community was for men or for women, but it soon developed into one of the most important women's religious houses in Germany. The church was entirely rebuilt on a grand scale by Henry I, Duke of Bavaria, in about 950. Henry was buried here and his widow Judith, who by virtue of her and her husband's generous endowment of the community, is counted as the founder, took the veil here, became abbess and was herself buried here in 990. This close connection with the ruling and Imperial Ottonian house made Niederm√ºnster powerful and wealthy. The treasures of Niederm√ºnster include the Rule of about 990 and the Uta Codex or Evangeliary of about 1025 with its casket of chased gold,Bayerische Staatsbibliothek M√ºnchen clm 13601 commissioned by an abbess of Niederm√ºnster and containing an illumination showing Saint Erhard presiding at Mass. There is also the magnificent cross given by Queen Gisela, daughter of Henry II, Duke of Bavaria, and wife of King Stephen I of Hungary, for the tomb of her mother, Duchess Gisela of Bavaria, who was buried here in 1006. In 1002 Emperor Henry II, son of Henry II, Duke of Bavaria, granted the community Reichsfreiheit (territorial and judicial independence of all save the Emperor) and it became an Imperial abbey, or Reichsstift. Emperor Henry II later favoured his own foundation of Bamberg Cathedral over Niederm√ºnster, which accordingly lost prominence and influence. The present Romanesque church was constructed after a fire in 1152 destroyed the previous one. The crypt of Saint Erhard remains from earlier buildings, however. In the 17th and 18th centuries the church was modernised, although very modestly, and fitted out with some important works of art, including a monumental bronze crucifix and a sorrowing Mary Magdalene by Georg Petel. The silver shrine of the relics of Saint Erhard dates from the 19th century. The community was dissolved in 1803 during the secularisation of Bavaria. From 1820 the premises were partly rented out. In 1821 the Bishop of Regensburg was given rooms here for his residence, and the episcopal offices were also transferred here. Also in 1821 the former canonry church took over from St. Ulrich's the role of cathedral parish church.

Early life Nicholas John Hondrogen, Jr. was born in Concord, New Hampshire in 1952, the oldest of five children. He grew up in New Hampshire, studying at Boston's School of the Museum of Fine Arts. There he was a student of the Flemish painter, Jan Cox. Cox encouraged him to finish the 5-year program in 2 years. During that time he also taught etching, lithography, and painting at the Museum School and painted outdoor murals in the Boston area under one of the last WPA programs. Career In 1972, Hondrogen moved to the suburbs of Paris and commuted to a tiny garage/studio in Belleville, in the 20th arrondissement. Showing in various group shows, his painting Gymnopedi II was purchased by Centre Georges Pompidou. His first one-person exhibition was sponsored by a grant from the French Ministry of Cultural Affairs in May 1974 at √âspace Pierre Cardin and La Pochade Gallery. From that show, The Museum of Modern Art of Paris purchased his painting Ghost Image No. 9. In 1982, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art showed his Additive/Subtractive series of photographs. In the early 1990s, Hondrogen moved to California turning his focus toward filmmaking, producing and directing the award-winning feature documentary Perfect Moment where he asked the question \\"If you were to die tomorrow what moment would you most remember?\\" The film includes a diverse cross section of people from talk show host Larry King, actor Vincent Gallo, composer Philip Glass to Vietnam veterans, homemakers and the homeless. The film was awarded the Audience Award at the 1997 Slamdance Film Festival. After the completion of the film, Hondrogen once again returned to painting. First with his series Mumonkan lasting from 1996 to 2000, then Natural Selection 2000 to 2002 and finally his Fractal Ellipse series from 2002 to 2007. During this period Hondrogen received a Pollock-Krasner Foundation grant for painting. Death In 2005, Hondrogen was diagnosed with peritoneal mesothelioma, cancer caused by exposure to asbestos. It was presumed he came in contact with asbestos while renovating his studios in Paris and New York. After a long battle with this relentless form of cancer, Hondrogen's career was cut short at the age of 55. After being cared for by his brother and his wife, John and Ann Hondrogen for 18 months, He died at the Fisher Hospice home a block away from his studio in Amherst, Massachusetts on February 28, 2007. After his death, The Nicholas Hondrogen Trust was formed to continue to grow his reputation in the art world. Hondrogen was cremated and there is no grave.

It was known for rock music, alternative rock, punk rock, hip hop, and heavy metal in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. Many famous bands such as Nirvana, Rob Zombie, The Ramones, Joan Jett, Stone Temple Pilots, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Pearl Jam, Tool, The Black Crowes, Los Lobos, Meat Puppets, and many others took the stage during its heyday. Founder The Mason Jar was founded in 1979. Early Arizona acts of note included the Spiffs, Blue Shoes, Llory McDonald, and the Schoolboys (later to become Capitol Records recording act Icon). It was founded by Clyde Shields and then sold to Franco Gagliano after a couple of years in business. Gagliano is credited with growing the club and making the small venue a success with national touring bands. Gagliano, originally from Sicily, managed the club from inception until the year 2000. Gagliano was known for his pizazz, personality, his clog shoes, and his love-hate relationships with the bands that played at the Mason Jar. Initial success Many bands came to the Mason Jar on their way to Sunset Strip in Hollywood, California. Some simply ran out of money, never making it to Los Angeles, and others simply liked Phoenix and decided to stay and made it their permanent home. Whatever the reason for passing through Phoenix, all bands somehow made their way to the Mason Jar and the club became world-renowned in the process. Scores of bands played at the Mason Jar before they made it big, such as Tool, Green Day, Kid Rock, Rage Against the Machine, Jane's Addiction, Candy, Red Hot Chile Peppers, and Guns N' Roses. Local bands such as Billy Clone and the Same,The Beat Angels, Burning Flamingos, The Jetzons, Surgical Steel, Flotsam and Jetsam, Icon, The Results and Sacred Reich also played there. Jason Newsted of Flotsam and Jetsam, who later became the bass player for Metallica, was a regular at the Mason Jar. The Manic Street Preachers were scheduled to play the final gig of their 1995 U.S. tour at the Mason Jar, before the tour was cancelled following the disappearance of Richey Edwards. Resurgence The Mason Jar experienced a resurgence as top Phoenix live music venue with the start of the new millennium, when in 2000 the club was bought by local businessman Michael Manfredi aka \\"Mick\\". Mick gave The Mason Jar a badly needed face lift, a substantial sound system upgrade and a new contemporary list of rising stars to hit the stage like, Linkin Park, Papa Roach, Fall Out Boy, Jimmy Eat World, Opeth, 30 Seconds to Mars and many more. Mick's appetite for diversity brought The Mason Jar into new genres including country music with acts like David Allan Coe, Hank Williams III and Shooter Jennings. Mick honored The Mason Jar's roots by hosting acts like Megadeth, The Ramones, Rob Halford, Dishwalla, Frank Black, Vanilla Ice, Stephen Pearcy, Ice-T, Robby Krieger and many, many others. The Mason Jar was a favorite launching ground of music industry execs like Jenna Adler of Creative Artist's Agency (Papa Roach, The Apex Theory) record labels like Sony and DreamWorks, management agencies like Sanctuary Music (Rob Halford) and of concert promoters like Danny Zelisko, owner of ‚ÄúEvening Star Productions‚Äù (now merged with Live Nation) Tom Lapenna and Wil Anderson of Lucky Man Concerts, Kim Larowe of 13th Floor Entertainment and many, many more. On August 15th, 2000 Linkin Park played their first live show with singer Chester Bennington at The Mason Jar, just two months before their debut record, Hybrid Theory. It was not uncommon to see famous artists, professional athletes and politicians at the Mason Jar. Artists like Sammy Hagar and Michael Anthony (Van Halen) would stop in to jam when booked on tour through Phoenix. Local artists like Alice Cooper and Glen Campbell's kids made their debut upon stage at The Mason Jar. The Mason Jar was often awarded \\"Top Club for Rock\\" by the readers of The Phoenix New Times. It gave music fans in Phoenix a chance to experience live bands the way club goers in Los Angeles and other major cities could. Closing The Mason Jar closed for business on February 15, 2005 when Mick sold the license to an outside party that no longer operated as The Mason Jar. The Mason Jar experienced its busiest year ever in its last year of business (when Mick was owner), boasting over 30 bands per week and dozens of shows on sale at Ticketmaster every month. In 2006 the club closed for remodeling and re-opened as a gay bar. On September 20, 2013 the building was used for the [Legends Of The Mason Jar - One More Time]. event. Promoted by Glenn De Jongh, the night featured reunions of many past Mason Jar acts from the 1980s and 1990s. Acts included The Spiffs/Urge, Raven Payne, Schoolboys Again (with members of Icon, King Kobra and Lizzy Borden), Scratch & Sniff, Egomaniacs, Killer Pussy, Blue Shoes, Box Of Cherries/Einsteins & Scott Rowe. Long time owner, Franco introduced the bands. In 2015, the site of old Mason Jar became a local musical venue once more when Stephen Chilton of Psyko Steve Presents re-opened it as The Rebel Lounge. The first show was The Atlas Moth, Take Over and Destroy, and Gatecreeper. The gay bar has moved and the site is once again promoting all kinds of musical performances. Rebel Lounge is established as a popular venue for emerging musical bands and DJs from all across America.

The date and place of Agilert's birth are unknown, but evidence suggests it took place between 610 and 620.Hunter, 1985.The abstract of Hammer 2011 gives his birth date as 610. Son of a Neustrian noble named Betto, he was a first cousin of Audoin and related to the Faronids and Agilolfings,Le Jan, pp. 382, notes 6, 388, & 390‚Äì391, table 48. Le Jan shows that Agilbert's first cousins included Saints Audoin and Dado, the future Bishop Ebregisil of Meaux, and Agilberta, the second abbess of Jouarre. and less certainly to the Merovingians.Fouracre. His name, the Frankish language equivalent of √Üthelberht, has been taken to suggest a link with the royal family of the Kingdom of Kent.Fouracre states: \\"[h]is very name was the Frankish form of √Üthelberht...\\". Le Jan, however, takes his name to indicate kinship with the Agilolfings; Le Jan, p. 388. Agilbert was consecrated as a bishop in Francia before he travelled to Britain. He arrived in the West Saxon kingdom after the return to power of King Cenwalh of Wessex, who had been driven out by Penda of Mercia, either in the late 640s or 650s. He was appointed to succeed Birinus (also later canonised, and attributed with conversion of Wessex to Christianity) as bishop of the West Saxons, or the Wessex folk, who following their seizure of part of Christian Mercia set up the first Wessex see as Bishop of Dorchester, near Oxford. Nothing remains above the surface of the Saxon cathedral, succeeded in the faith by Norman Dorchester Abbey church which has decorative memorials to the two early bishops. Agilbert, according to Bede's Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, had \\"spent a long time in Ireland for the purpose of studying the Scriptures\\".Bede, HE, Book III, Chapter 7. His appointment was due to Cenwalh.Kirby Earliest English Kings pp. 48-49 From Bede, it appears that Agilbert did not speak Old English, and it is said that his see was divided in two, with Wine being given half, because King Cenwalh \\"tired of his barbarous speech\\", although this may be mistaken.Higham, p. 255. This insult supposedly led to Agilbert's resignation. He then travelled north to Northumbria, where he ordained Wilfrid.Eddius, VW, chapter 9. He was present at the Synod of Whitby in 664, where he led the pro-Roman party, but he had the young Wilfrid speak on his behalf.Bede, HE, Book III, Chapter 25; Eddius, VW, chapter 10. The charter of Clotilde, 10 March 673, endowing the monastery of Bruy√®res-le- Ch√¢tel; witnessed by Agilbert, this is his last appearance in year-dated records Returning to Francia, Agilbert later took part in Wilfrid's consecration as a bishop at Compi√®gne.Eddius, VW, chapters 11 & 12. Agilbert became bishop of Paris between 666 and 668, and hosted Theodore of Tarsus. He was later invited to return by Cenwalh, to become bishop of Winchester, but sent his nephew Leuthhere in his place.Fouracre; Rich√©. One modern historian, D. P. Kirby, is unsure if Agilbert actually went to Northumbria after being expelled from Dorchester, suggesting it is just as likely that he went directly to the continent. Agilbert died at some time after 10 March 673, on which date he witnessed Clotilde's foundation charter for the Abbey of Bruy√®res-le-Ch√¢tel, and probably between 679 and 690. He was buried at Jouarre Abbey where his sister Theodechildis was abbess. His fine sculpted sarcophagus can be seen there in the crypts, as can that of his sister.

Murphey was born near Red House Presbyterian Church in Orange County, North Carolina (in an area that would later become Caswell County). His father Archibald Murphey was a North Carolina revolutionary officer, while his mother, Jane DeBow was from New Jersey. Archibald was one of seven children. He was educated at Dr. Caldwell's Academy, and entered the University of North Carolina in 1796 and graduated in 1799 with honors. Murphey served as a professor at his college for a few years, then moved to Hillsborough to study law with William Duffy from July to November 1801 at the home now known as Twin Chimneys. He married Jane Armistead Scott and bought the Hermitage plantation from Jane Armistead Scott's father, John Scott. Murphey was very active in business and political affairs and represented Orange County in the North Carolina State Senate from 1812 to 1818. Murphey was well known for his proposals regarding internal improvements, public schools, and constitutional reform. In 1817, Murphey submitted a legislative report recommending that North Carolina create a publicly financed system of education. In 1819, he drafted a document proposing a program to build roads and canals throughout the state. This proposal was ignored by Murphey's fellow legislators. In 1818, he was elected a superior court judge by the legislature, but gave up the position after two years to concentrate on his worsening financial situation and to research and publish a history of the State of North Carolina. Unsuccessful in securing a seat on the North Carolina Supreme Court, he nevertheless sat on the court in its early years to fill in when any of the three judges on the court had to disqualify themselves because of their previous law practices. Murphey Hall at UNC Murphey did not have much luck in accomplishing any of his goals. Many of the results to his plans came after his death. His state history was never written, lacking the funding that it needed. He did however collect papers, the first volume of which are held by Harvard and the second volume by the University of Virginia, that were helpful for later historians. Meanwhile, Murphey's financial problems were getting worse and worse. Being unable to pay his debts, Murphey was even put in jail for twenty days in Greensboro, North Carolina in 1829. Archibald Murphey died at Twin Chimneys in Hillsborough on February 1, 1832. He is buried at the Presbyterian Church in Hillsborough, North Carolina. The town of Murphy, North Carolina (despite its spelling) was named after him. Murphey Traditional Academy, an elementary school in Greensboro, North Carolina, also bears his name, as well as Murphey Hall at the University of North Carolina, and several other schools in Orange and Caswell County. An historical marker located along Churton Street in Hillsborough, North Carolina, summarizes his career and also indicates the proximity of his grave.

Building The new building in 2013 With its founding in 1976, the then‚Äì museum shared a building with the Congregation Mikveh Israel. In 2005, it was announced that the museum would be moved to a new building to be built at Fifth Street and Market Street on the Independence Mall. The site was originally owned by CBS' KYW radio and KYW-TV. The project broke ground on September 30, 2007. The glass and terra-cotta building was designed by James Polshek and includes an atrium, a area for exhibits, a Center for Jewish Education, and a theater. The structural engineer was Leslie E.

The tradition arose from the blending of indigenous and Catholic traditions, most notably Carnival, with its permission to be masked and to mock. Chinelos mock Europeans and European mannerisms from the colonial period up to the end of the 19th century. The Chinelos tradition is strongest in Morelos, especially around Carnival, but Chinelos now appear at other festivities such as Independence Day celebrations, private parties and more. History Traditional Tlayacapan Chinelos costume in the La Cereria Museum Face of a Chinelos dancer in Xochimilco, Mexico City The word ‚Äúchinelos‚Äù is derived from the Nahuatl word ‚Äúzineloquie‚Äù which means ‚Äúdisguised.‚Äù The dance is one of many to develop after the Spanish conquest as native traditions and rites blended into Christian festivals. One of these is Carnival, with its traditions of wearing masks, role reversal, anonymity and behaviors not normally tolerated. This dance developed as a mockery of the Europeans with their fine clothing, beards, fair skin and mannerisms. The modern Chinelos costume began to take shape from between the mid 19th century to the early 20th. The elaborate dress, gloved hands, uptilted beard and arrogant stance also makes fun of the salon dancing of the upper classes during the period of the French intervention as well as Porfirio D√≠az‚Äôs attempts to ‚ÄúEuropeanize‚Äù Mexico at the end of the 19th century. The dance developed in the state of Morelos, part of the State of Mexico, part of the Federal District of Mexico City (generally in the south) and even as far as the municipality of Taxco in Guerrero . They are the best known Carnival dancers in Mexico with Morelos having the most groups. The dance became most developed in the state of Morelos, which in the 19th century was home to a number of sugar cane haciendas which made great fortunes for their owners, but left workers impoverished. Four large municipalities in the state, whose histories extend back to the pre-Hispanic period, are famous for their Chinelos: Tlayacapan, Tepoztl√°n and Yautepec and Jiutepec. The town of Tlayacapan is probably where the modern format for Chinelo dancing originated. The Chinelos here still perform in the former monastery‚Äôs extra large atrium during Carnival. The Chinelo dancers are now a symbol of the state of Morelos, with the tradition increasing with more towns having dance troupes and it is possible to see troupes dancing at times other than Carnival. It is even possible to hire Chinelos dancers for special occasions. Chinelos are now part of the annual Independence Day celebrations in Cuernavaca . The tradition in Taxco was more popular over a hundred years ago but it has waned. There is still one group with about forty members in a community called Landa. They can be seen associated with the festival associated with Our Lady of Sorrows as well as for Candlemas on February 2. Costumes Mannequin dressed as a Chinelo at the Palace of Cort√©s, Cuernavaca. The Chinelos costume consists of four main items: a long flowing robe which usually has a rectangular shape tunic, a mask, a large plumed hat, and gloves. The flowing robe and delicate decoration has an almost feminine appearance, making the dancers appear androgynous. These robes are usually made out of velvet. As the robes are extremely hot to dance in, dancers wear bandannas to prevent excessive sweating and dehydration. The Chinelos costume of Tlayacapan is the closest to the original developed in the 19th century. The hat is broader, less embellished with only two or three large feathers. A patterned bandana tied around the head is worn underneath the hat. The tunic is a white robe of white or blue, which is generally not embroidered. The rectangular cape has an image of the Virgin of Guadalupe . As the tradition spread and developed, especially in Morelos, other towns and groups made distinctive changes to their Chinelos gear and today each town and troupe has its own distinctive elements. This began the process of making extremely elaborate costumes in some places. In Yautepec, the best costumes are made of velvet and are entirely covered in designs and images made from beads, sequins, ribbing and imitation precious stones. These decorative elements can be expensive such as quality beads imported from the Czech Republic . The hats have pre-Hispanic images and modern interpretations of ancient legends. In Tepotzl√°n, the tunic is made from black velvet and is completely smooth with the image on the back painted on, rather than stitched. The feather decoration in the hat is made of fabric. The hat became higher, straighter and more elaborate, with a black velvet tunic embroidered with sequins. The Chinelo's masks are made of mesh and always feature an upturned beard and European features. It and the bandana wrapped around the head are essential in keeping Chinelos‚Äô identities secret, something reinforced with the use of gloves on the hands. To further assure anonymity, costumes are closely guarded and kept secret. Members of the troupe dress in different houses to add to the confusion. The elaborate decorations have made the costumes expensive to make. Prices for making the outfit can range anywhere from 4,000 to 100,000 pesos depending on the complexity of the decoration, the materials used and the time involved. For example, decorations done in beads is more expensive than those in sequins as the beads are smaller. A really elaborate costume can cost up to $2,000 or 400,000 pesos to make. There are now professional Chinelo tunic, mask and hat makers as well as competitions to determine best costume. In Tlayacapan there are at least eight families that dedicated themselves full-time to making the gear. Jos√© Salazar Flores of Tepotzl√°n makes his living making nothing but Chinelo hats. These hats alone can cost anywhere from 12,000 to 30,000 pesos and take about forty days each. The hat is made from fabric with frame made from palm leaves. The costumes worn at previous Carnivals or other occasions can fetch up to 100,000 pesos from collectors. Performances Chinelos in procession with the \\"Ni√±opa\\" image in Xochimilco The dance, literally called a ‚Äúbrincon‚Äù or ‚Äújump‚Äù is a set of repetitive steps. The choreography is very simple. With feet apart and knees slightly bent, the dancers take two shuffling steps, then leading with one shoulder or the other, take a small jump to the right or left. Dancers join in and drop out for longer events but the group dances as long as the band plays. Most Chinelos dancers are young men as it is tiring and the costumes can be suffocating. The role of a Chinelo dancer is passed on from parents to children. On some occasions children dance on a different day than their parents. Most traditionally, Chinelos dance for Carnival, with events beginning as early as the last weekend of January and different towns take turns on the following weekends until Lent begins. The dances take place on the weekends between mid afternoon on Fridays until late evening on Sundays. The dancers are always accompanied by a brass band. The music is most traditional at the Carnival of Tlayacapan, which also gave rise to the Banda de Musica Santa Maria de Tlayacapan, the best known musical group of Morelos. In the boroughs of Milpa Alta and Xochimilco, there is no important festival without the participation of these dancers. The dancers also accompany the celebrated ‚ÄúNi√±opa‚Äù image during its many processions and festivities in its honor during the year.

In 2019, the Pa Then numbered 8,248 people. Subsistence Before 1970, the Pa Then practiced slash-and-burn (swidden) cultivation (Vu 2013:70-71). The Pa Then began to switch to wet-rice cultivation starting in 1970, and from 1993 onwards, most Pa Then had given up slash-and-burn cultivation. Currently the Pa Then grow various kinds of rice, including large-grained glutinous rice, long-grained glutinous rice, red glutinous rice, and non-glutinous rice varieties. Traditionally, the Pa Then grew rice, maize, cassava, sesame, cassava, taro, lettuce, calabash, luffa, colocynth, sweet gourd, beans, and Chinese peas as food crops. The Pa Then also planted various spices such as basil, shallot, spring onion, garlic, ginger, crocus, red pepper, lesser galangal, citronella, eryngium, perilla, and marjoram. Sugarcane was also planted as well as fruit trees such as tangerine, guava, banana, grapefruit, lychee, longan, jackfruit, orange, and papaya.

However, these spirits can also cause disease and crop failures when upset. Malevolent spirits include ghosts of people who die sudden deaths, the Forest spirit, the Cliff spirit, and plant spirits. Each god is worshiped using different rituals (Vu 2013:122-127). *The Stove god: Worshiping the Stove god takes an entire day, starting from 9 AM until 11 AM of the next day.

It lies approximately southwest of Hays. History The land was bought by Charles K. Holliday of Topeka, and a townsite plat was filed with the county in 1899. Holliday began selling town lots. Some of the first residents came from the town of Chetolah, just across the Smoky Hill River. Chetolah had been founded ten years earlier in the anticipation of a railroad connection that was never built. With the influential Hollidays backing the new town of Smoky Hill City, residents of Chetolah deserted to the new town. Charles Holliday was the son of railroad magnate Cyrus K. Holliday. Both father and son believed that the area contained valuable mineral deposits. The town was situated on the north bank of the Smoky Hill River to serve the gold mines that Charles Holliday imagined would spring up to mine the supposed gold-bearing shale along the Smoky Hill River valley. The idea that the shales of along the Smoky Hill River contained valuable minerals started in the mid-19th century as a swindle by Native Americans who said that they knew of tin mines along the Smoky Hill. In the 1890s, prospectors imagined that they found zinc in the shale of Ellis and adjacent Trego County, and then believed that they found gold. The delusion was abetted by unscrupulous assayers, and by swindlers selling secret metallurgical processes to extract gold from the shale. Vigorously warning against the gold delusion was Kansas state geologist Erasmus Haworth, even though the influential promoters threatened to have him fired for his opposition. The Ellis County gold boom sputtered along from 1895 to 1903, by which time (almost) everyone realized that there was no gold in the shale. The designation of Smoky Hill City as a townsite was vacated by Ellis County in 1905, at the request of Charles Holliday. The settlement survived for several more years, but was eventually completely abandoned. Geography The townsite occupied approximately in sections 3 and 10 of Township 15 South, Range 20 West of the 6th Principal Baseline and Meridian, , elevation above sea level.

The opening Andante gives way to a more agitated sonata movement.

The development section, with its broken tenths in the left hand and the polyphony in the treble, is very original in its sonorities.

Stoicism According to the Stoics, the mind is constantly being bombarded with impressions (phantasiai). (An impression arising from the mind was called a phantasma.) VII.49 Some of these impressions are true and some false. Impressions are true when they are truly affirmed, false if they are wrongly affirmed, such as when one believes an oar dipped in the water to be broken because it appears so.George Henry Lewes, (1880), The history of philosophy: from Thales to Comte, page 360 When Orestes, in his madness, mistook Electra for a Fury, he had an impression both true and false: true inasmuch as he saw something, viz., Electra; false, inasmuch as Electra was not a Fury. Believing that the mind instinctively discriminated between real and false impressions, the Stoics said that one ought not to give credit to everything which is perceived, but only to those perceptions which contain some special mark of those things which appeared.Thomas Woodhouse Levin, (1871), Six lectures introductory to the philosophical writings of Cicero, page 71 Such a perception then was called a (), or comprehensible perception. The is that which is impressed by an object which exists, and which is a copy of that object and can be produced by no other object. Cicero relates that Zeno would illustrate katalepsis as follows: > he would display his hand in front of one with the fingers stretched out and > say \\"A visual appearance is like this\\"; next he closed his fingers a little > and said, \\"An act of assent is like this\\"; then he pressed his fingers > closely together and made a fist, and said that that was comprehension (and > from this illustration he gave to that process the actual name of > katalepsis, which it had not had before); but then he used to apply his left > hand to his right fist and squeeze it tightly and forcibly, and then say > that such was knowledge, which was within the power of nobody save the wise > man II.145 Katalepsis was the main bone of contention between the Stoics and the two schools of philosophical skepticism during the Hellenistic period: the Pyrrhonists and the Academic Skeptics of Plato's Academy. These Skeptics, who chose the Stoics as their natural philosophical opposites, eschewed much of what the Stoics believed regarding the human mind and one's methods of understanding greater meanings.See Ancient Greek Skepticism at the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy for information about katalepsis and the Skeptics' attack on it. To the Skeptics, all perceptions were acataleptic, i.e. bore no conformity to the objects perceived, or, if they did bear any conformity, it could never be known.George Henry Lewes, (1863), The biographical history of philosophy, Volume 1, page 297 Notes Category:Stoicism Category:Concepts in ancient Greek epistemology ","title":"Katalepsis"},{"id":"13601109","text":"Ciro Redondo is a municipality and town in the Ciego de √Åvila Province of Cuba.

It is located in the western part of the province, south of Chambas. This municipality merged in 1976 as result of the new political and administrative division of Cuba. Florencia was formerly the barrios of Guadalupe, Tamarindo and Marroqu√≠ which were separated from the municipality of Mor√≥n. Overview The municipality is a mountain region with rivers, forest and caves with subterranean rivers. A huge hydraulic complex was constructed under Fidel's government in 1991 named \\"Liberaci√≥n de Florencia\\" (\\"Florencia Independence\\") since the Florencia area was the first quarter taken by local revolutionary forces in the province of Camag√ºey on December 14, 1958. This hydraulic complex is located in the fertile valleys of Florencia and Tamarindo and it reinforces the beauty of this Cuban area. Unlike other municipalities in this province, Florencia is the only one where its economy is basically tobacco. Florencia is also the seat of the municipal government and the biggest city with around 7,000 people. Other towns are Tamarindo, Las Pojas, Lowrey, Guadalupe and Marroqu√≠. History Florencia Valley with El Merino Hill behind In 1920's the Norte de Cuba railroad opened between the cities of Santa Clara and Puerto Tarafa in Nuevitas (Camag√ºey). The origin of Florencia was the construction of a railroad station to provide access to its Guadalupe neighbors in 1926. Guadalupe is the oldest town in this region. This train station was built on a farm known as El Merino (on a site called Ojo de Agua (eye of water)). The railroad was crucial for this region, it actually was the first means of communication and transport that linked these lost valleys with the rest of country. In the 1920s the roads were almost nonexistent and people lived in complete isolation. The only method of communication and transport was by arreas (mules). With the arrival of the railroad, the farmers became wealthier and as a result many merchants and businessmen moved their companies to be near the new station. Real estate companies and the local owners of the farms started to develop what is now this enchanting town. First the railroad station and then the new town itself was named Florencia. The name was suggested by one of the neighbors who said that the mountain view reminded her of the mountains near Florence in Italy. The fast increase of its population was in part due to the Sans√≥ & Cia, which opened a big food industry in the town in the 1940s and also as a result of the construction of dams on the Chambas river. When the water of the dams flooded the Florencia and Tamarindo valleys in the 1990s, many of the affected farmers and their families moved to Florencia. Florencia grew quickly, and it has since become the most important cultural and economical centre with the best communications facilities in the area. Before 1976, Florencia was part of the municipality of Mor√≥n, which was divided into six new municipalities of the new province of Ciego de Avila. A new identity was created for people after Florencia became a new municipality: Florencianos (Florencians). Geography Swimming at Campismo Boqueron This territory is located in the Northwest Ciego de √Åvila Province of Cuba. The Chambas River and its confluents flow South to North across the Florencia, Guadalupe and Tamarindo valleys. The Liberation of Florencia Dams, in this river, cover a great areas of those valleys. The valleys are surrounded by hills which are part of the Central Cordillera (one of the three Mountain Systems of the Island). Those high grounds separate the municipality from the other part of the province which is almost flat and with different geographical features. To the Northwest the North Jatibonico River merges into Jatibonico Sierra forming a system of caves with a singular beauty at a rich forest and fauna area known as Boqueron. Boqueron is a National Natural Reserve with a camping area and is the location of the Florencia Hipic Center. Between Boqueron and Florencia Valley is El Merino Hill, which is the highest peak of the Jatibonico Sierra with 396.6 m over sea level. The hill is visible from every point of the town. Social, Economic and Cultural Life The main economical activity is agriculture with tobacco grown as the major plant. Other important areas include the refinement of conserved food, growth of vegetables and fruit, and livestock production. The culture tradition of this municipality has its origin fundamentally in the country sector. This sector includes a large ethnic diversity formed mainly by the Canarian Migration from the late 19th century and early 20th century. The major artistic manifestation which more representativity has reached in Florencian lands during its history has been La D√©cima (literary composition to be sung written in 10 syllables). In Florencia, in 1968 the Primer Taller Literario Decimista de Cuba' was founded' (First Decimista Literary symposium of Cuba)instituted by humble country men. People are proud of their traditions and popular celebrations. The most important events are spending entire Saturday nights in parrandas g√ºajiras (Cuban country music parties), celebration of 14 de Diciembre, los Pinos (pine tree), memorials to Isabel Victoria (the first teacher and the greatest contributor to public works in Florencia town) and Lucas Buchillon (the regional poet). At other times, the election of La Flor de Virama (the tobacco flower) (similar to a Miss Florencia contest) and the Carnaval Star are some of the most exciting activities. In Tamarindo the celebration of January'28 is important. All of these festivities are celebrated as street parties, very common in Cuba. There are many cultural institutions such as the Florencia Municipal Museum, which has a rich collection of objects of Cuban Natives recovered from different areas of the Chambas River shores, Casa de la Cultura (cultural house), and Municipal Library. Boqueron a National Natural Reserve is 4 km west of Florencia city and it is a local, national and international touristic destination. This natural reserve has caves, rivers, and a rich forest and animal life. The \\"Hipic Center of Florencia\\" located at Boqueron area, together with fishing at the \\"Liberaci√≥n\\" Dam are the most important tourist attractions. Demographics In 2004, the municipality of Florencia had a population of 19,811. With a total area of , it has a population density of . Now, Florencia has a negative average population growth, it was -4.59 in 2004. The municipality population decreased from 19,856 in 2002 to 19,765 in 2004. This is controversial in Ciego de Avila where the province has one of the highest average population growths in the nation.

Its civil headquarters were at Carmarthen. Its ecclesiastical centre (and perhaps, in the Age of the Saints, the seat of a bishopWilliams, A.

Although carrying relatively heavy weaponry, she was used for unassuming tasks, such as carrying dispatches and providing surveillance. When she ran aground in unfriendly waters, she was scrapped to prevent her falling into the hands of the Confederate forces. Assigned to the Potomac River Flotilla Island Belle was purchased at New York City from Luther Adams on 4 September 1861. She fitted out at Washington Navy Yard and sailed on 17 September to join the Potomac Flotilla. She served in the Potomac as a tug and a dispatch boat occasionally exchanging fire with batteries and riflemen on the Virginia shore. She sailed to Hampton Roads, Virginia on 19 March 1862, escorting transports carrying troops to Fort Monroe in preparation for the Peninsular campaign against Richmond, Virginia. She returned to Washington, D.C., as soon as the soldiers were disembarked and again got underway for Hampton Roads escorting a second division of transports on 23 March. Island Belle devoted most of April and May to reconnaissance work, searching the Virginia rivers between Washington and Richmond for information valuable to either the Army or the Navy. Reassigned to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron Island Belle was transferred to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron on 22 May. Two days later, Flag Officer Goldborough assigned her to duty in the James River where the Navy was valiantly supporting the left flank of General George B. McClellan's mighty force as it advanced up the peninsula toward Richmond, Virginia. She steamed up the James on 25 May, carefully observing the river banks to detect any signs of Confederate military activity. When she joined Commander William Smith, the senior Naval officer on the James, he used Island Belle in a wide variety of ways. He sent her on reconnaissance missions to learn about enemy defenses in the Chickahominy River and other tributaries of the James; he entrusted her with his messages to General McClellan and to the other ships of his command; he used her to carry coal to the hungry furnaces of his steamships; and he kept her on call to help refloat ships which often ran aground in the tricky and ever-changing currents of the river. Island Belle burned to prevent capture On 26 June, Island Belle steamed up the shallow Appomattox River in an attempt to destroy the railroad bridge at Petersburg, Virginia. The next day, she ran hard aground. After strenuous efforts failed to refloat her, Island Belle was burned on 28 June 1862 to prevent her falling into Confederate hands.

This is a single sonata form movement which bridges the gap between Scriabin's third and his fourth sonata. Scriabin wrote this piece during an otherwise compositionally unproductive period during his tenure at the Moscow Conservatory. The first edition was published by Belaieff. The piece's existence may have been forgotten by the composer. According to Leonid Sabaneyev, when Sabaneev started to play one of its themes on the piano in Scriabin's Moscow flat (now a museum), Scriabin called out from the next room \\"Who wrote that? It sounds familiar\\". \\"Your 'Fantaisie'\\", was the reply. Scriabin said, \\"What 'Fantaisie'?\\". This story, told by Sabaneev and repeated by Faubion Bowers in his biography of Scriabin, may however be apocryphal. At any rate, as Sabaneev saw fit to fake Scriabin's death-date and otherwise make free with facts, his recountings of otherwise uncorroborated stories are best taken with a grain of salt. Be that as it may, Faubion Bowers' extensive documentation of Scriabin's concert programs shows no evidence of Scriabin having played the piece in public. The Fantasy begins with ambiguous, open harmony not unlike that which Scriabin used for the opening of his second sonata, known as the Sonata-Fantasy. The opening is clearly in B minor, but the tonic is consistently avoided: a technique used extensively in Chopin's ballades, in Wagner's Tristan und Isolde, and by Scriabin himself in his third and fourth sonatas. The opening is characterized by an inexorably descending bassline and a melody that alternately struggles upwards and plunges dramatically back down in jagged gestures. This brooding opening gives way to one of Scriabin's most beautiful melodies, a second subject in D major. The melody is treated canonically, with multiple voices echoing above an extremely widespread left-hand accompaniment. The closing groups, also in D major, are grand and confident with rhythmic obsessiveness and directional gestures characteristic of Scriabin's heroic writing. In the recapitulation, the first subject is extensively elaborated with sweeping arpeggios in both hands. It is, however, truncated, giving way quite rapidly to a transition to the second theme. The second subject, meanwhile, is recapitulated in grandeur rather than tenderness: an apotheosis not unlike the thematic transformation of the main subject in Chopin's first Ballade from its initial tender statement in E‚ô≠ major to its grand exuberance in A major. Despite the implications of freedom and improvisation entailed in the title \\"Fantasy,\\" the work is really a rather straightforward (if not formulaic) sonata allegro. Its exposition has a clear first subject and transition, followed by a second subject and closing groups in the relative major. The development section is characteristically stormy, sequencing motives from the exposition; and except for the truncation of the first theme the recapitulation maps measure for measure onto the exposition. The \\"Fantasy\\" elements take over, however, at the end of the recapitulation: rather than settling comfortably into B major, the piece launches into a coda that is at turns free and improvisational, sequential (almost a second development), and recapitulatory. (See for comparison the fourth movement of Scriabin's sonata in F# minor, which seems to be on ambiguous formal borderline between sonata-allegro and sonata-rondo.) Ultimately the coda ends triumphantly in B major, with a strong evocation of Wagner's \\"Isoldes Liebestod.\\" At any rate the texture at the close is very similar to that of Liszt's transcription of the Wagner; the key is the same; and in each case the major tonic is approached by the supertonic half diminished seventh chord. The Fantasy contains some of Scriabin's most difficult writing. The dense textures are difficult to voice, the collisions between the hands require careful working out, and the left-hand accompaniment is in places more or less impossible (requiring redistribution).

Currently, he is the eighth most senior apostle in the church.Apostolic seniority is generally understood to include all ordained apostles (including the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Seniority is determined by date of ordination, not by age or other factors. If two apostles are ordained on the same day, the older of the two is typically ordained first. See Succession to the presidency and . Biographical background Born in Logan, Utah, Cook is among three children of Bernice Kimball and J. Vernon Cook. He is a great-great grandson of LDS Church apostle Heber C. Kimball and great-grandson of David Patten Kimball. Raised in Logan, Cook attended Logan High School, where he participated in many sports, including football, basketball, baseball, and track. At Logan High, he was a teammate of future NFL great Merlin Olsen. From 1960 to 1962, Cook served as an LDS Church missionary in England, where he and Jeffrey R. Holland served as companions, with Marion D. Hanks as mission president. After his return, he married his high school sweetheart, Mary Gaddie, in the Logan Utah Temple on November 30, 1962.

Later in his career, he served as president and chief executive officer of California Healthcare System (CHS) for three years and then as vice chairman of Sutter Health System. Cook did pro bono work as a city attorney for 14 years. Cook's work in privatizing hospitals in California involved some controversy. As an attorney representing public hospital districts, he negotiated deals favorable to nonprofit healthcare corporations before leaving to become an executive with those corporations. Critics claimed the deal quietly gave public revenues to private interests.San Francisco Examiner quoted from November 24, 1987. In In a lawsuit to regain control of the hospital, the districts alleged this was a conflict of interest and violated their public mission, but the court found that statute of limitations had expired. The hospital became part of CHS, which later joined Sutter Health, both of which held Cook as a top executive. LDS Church service Within the LDS Church, Cook has served as a bishop, counselor in a stake presidency, president of the church's San Francisco California Stake, regional representative, and area seventy. Cook was called as a general authority and member of the Second Quorum of the Seventy on April 6, 1996. He was transferred to the First Quorum of the Seventy on April 5, 1998. He was appointed as a member of the Presidency of the Seventy on August 1, 2007. As a general authority, Cook served in the presidency in the church's Philippines Area, as president of the Pacific and North America Northwest areas, and as executive director of the Missionary Department. On October 6, 2007, Cook was sustained as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, filling a vacancy created by Henry B.

The Argentine marines trace their origins to the Spanish Naval Infantry, which took part in conflicts in South America in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Argentine marines took part in various conflicts of the nineteenth and twentieth century, notably the War of the Triple Alliance and the Falklands War. The marines (represented by the 5th Naval Infantry Battalion) are considered to have been among the best Argentine combat units present in the Falklands.

(He was first of two Richard Onslows and three Onslows to be elected Speaker.) He was born in Shrewsbury, a younger son of Roger Onslow and his first wife Margaret Poyner. History of Parliament member article by P.W. Hasler. Onslow entered the Inner Temple in 1545, from which he was briefly expelled in 1556 with several other members for involvement in an affray but was readmitted after an apology and a spell in the Fleet Prison and was a Bencher (giving power to call graduates to the bar) in 1559, and Governor from 1564 to 1566. He was Recorder of London in 1563. From 1557 to 1558 and 1562 to his death in 1571 he was Member of Parliament for Steyning, a tiny borough in Sussex. In 1559 he was elected MP for Aldborough, north Yorkshire. His religious sympathies were with the Puritan party, and the Spanish ambassador described him as a \\"furious heretic\\". In 1566 he was appointed Solicitor General, and was summoned to attend the House of Lords by a writ of assistance. However, later the same year the Speaker of the Commons died, and the Privy Council chose Onslow to succeed him. At this period the appointment was effectively a Crown nomination, though theoretically the House of Commons had a free choice; Onslow was the royal candidate but was opposed, the only occasion on which this happened during the Elizabethan period. As is the convention, Onslow spoke in opposition to his own appointment, and argued that the independence of the Speakership was incompatible with the Solicitor General's oath to the Queen; this gave his critics good excuse to oppose, but he was nevertheless eventually approved by 82 votes to 70, and became Speaker on 2 October 1566. He was Speaker until its dissolution in January 1567. Onslow may have been the author of Arguments Related to the Sea Landes and Salt Shores. He married Catherine Harding, by whom he had two sons and five daughters, including Edward, ancestor of the Earls of Onslow, and Cicely, who married Sir Humphrey Winch. Onslow died from 'pestilential fever' at Harnage near Shrewsbury, after visiting a relative in the town, in April 1571 and was buried in the then St Chad's Church in Shrewsbury where a tomb monument was erected, that was restored in 1742 by his descendant, Arthur Onslow, himself a past Speaker. After the fall of the church in 1788 the monument was moved to the Abbey Church in Shrewsbury, where it remains.

For the American bishop, see Victor Hermann Balke. Hermann Balk (died March 5, 1239, W√ºrzburg), also known as Hermann von Balk or Hermann Balke, was a Knight-Brother of the Teutonic Order and its first Landmeister, or Provincial Master, in both Prussia and Livonia. From 1219 to 1227, he served as the Deutschmeister in the Order's Province of Alemannia. Balk led the crusaders during the Prussian Crusade and became Master of Prussia in 1230. From 1237 to 1238, he also served in the additional role as Master of Livonia.  Life  Balk came from a family of Lower Saxon-Markish origin.Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie He may have been a former canon at Hildesheim and may have joined the Teutonic Knights at Acre in 1189.Urban, p. 279 He was well respected by fellow Roman Catholics, but he had no patience for pagans.Urban, p. 55 His leadership and traditions were emulated by his successors throughout the 13th century, and he created the master's seal presenting the flight into Egypt. While all other masters' seals were anonymous, only Balk's included his name. In 1226, the Teutonic Knights were invited to combat the Old Prussians by Duke Conrad I of Masovia, whose lands had been raided by the pagans over the preceding decades. Balk led the first substantial detachment of Teutonic Knights to Castle Vogelsang near Toru≈Ñ. The master allegedly negotiated the Treaty of Kruszwica with Conrad in 1230, by which the Teutonic Knights would control Culmerland and future conquests instead of them passing to the Masovian duke or Bishop Christian of Oliva; the arrangement was similar to what had been agreed upon by Emperor Frederick II in the 1226 Golden Bull of Rimini.Urban, p. 56 Granted the titles of LandpflegerSeward, p. 101 (per Sclavoniam et Prusiam preceptor) and Landmeister, Balk led the Teutonic Knights during the conquests of Culmerland, Pomesania, and northern Warmia in the first decade of the Prussian Crusade, the 1230s. Because the Teutonic Order's primary focus was defending Outremer, Balk, the \\"Pizarro of the Baltic lands\\", had limited resources at his disposal. He utilized guerilla warfare, forest ambushes, and his white-cloaked cavalry in winter campaigns; the master crossed the Vistula in 1231 to hang a Prussian chief from a sacred oak tree. Balk allowed tribes who accepted Christianity to become auxiliaries of the Teutonic Knights and left them with their lands, while tribes that remained pagan were defeated and expelled. Ballistae and crossbows were used by the crusaders to capture the Prussians' forts. Under Balk's leadership, castles were built at Marienwerder (Kwidzyn), Culm (Che≈Çmno), Elbing (ElblƒÖg), and Thorn (Toru≈Ñ). The master encouraged the settlement of German colonists near Teutonic Ordensburg castles; the municipal privileges granted to Culm and Toru≈Ñ on 28 December 1233 by Balk and Grand Master Hermann von Salza became the basis for Culm law, which was later applied to other developing towns in Prussia. The Livonian Brothers of the Sword, a German military order active in Livonia, were crushed by Samogitians in the 1236 Battle of Saule. The remnants of the Sword-Brothers were assimilated into the Teutonic Order the following year, and Balk was given the charge of reorganizing the new brethren. He recruited sixtySeward, p. 102 knights from the Teutonic Order's north German convents, as they spoke the Low German used by the Sword-Brothers. After sailing to Riga, he distributed his troops to reinforce the countryside. At Stensby in 1238, Balk returned Danish Estonia, which had been conquered by the Sword-Brothers, to King Valdemar II of Denmark. The upset Livonian Brethren refused to cooperate with Balk, who traveled to Italy to seek aid from Grand Master Hermann von Salza and Pope Gregory IX. Balk received little assistance, as Gregory IX was feuding with Emperor Frederick II and Hermann von Salza died in Salerno.Urban, p. 91 Dietrich von Gr√ºningen was named Master of Livonia later in 1238, and Balk died at W√ºrzburg in Franconia the next year.  Legacy  The memory of Hermann von Balk's leading role in the conquest and Christianization of the Che≈Çmno Land and as the actual founder of the State of the Teutonic Order was very much alive in West Prussia until the annexation of this area to Poland in 1919. This is evidenced by numerous monuments and in particular artfully designed fountains in West Prussian cities, which are dedicated to this first Landmaster.

As the Spanish protectorate became too dominant, the Prince of Monaco concluded the Treaty of P√©ronne on 14 September 1641 with King Louis XIII of France... Based on the terms of the treaty, Prince Honor√© permitted Monaco to become a French protectorate in return for guarantees entailing the preservation of his rights as sovereign. Moreover, Honor√© wanted to be included in all French treaties and be given grants of land in France as compensation for any privately-owned territories he might lose in Habsburg Spain. Overall, the treaty led to the removal of the Spanish garrison in Monaco by the French and ultimately regulated the relations between France and Monaco for 150 years.The Gentleman's Magazine, p. 33. \\"He had long been scheming with Richelieu to exchange the Spanish for a French protectorate, and in 1641 the treaty of P√©ronne regulated for the next century and a half the relations of Monaco and France. A French garrison was to occupy the fortress, but the Prince was to preserve his sovereign rights, to be included in all French treaties, and be compensated for the property which he will lose in Spain by grants of lands in France. The fortress was captured by means of a surprise, the French garrison established, and the Prince created ‚Äî a title which still runs in the family ‚Äî and received with the greatest honours at the French Court.\\"  Background  In the context of Franco-Spanish rivalry and the Thirty Years' War, the Prince of Monaco sought to get rid of Spanish tutelage. Cardinal Richelieu, Chief Minister of France, sought to take advantage of weakening Habsburg power and strengthen France by extending French influence over the Rock of Monaco.  Main clauses  * The 14-article treaty removed the Prince of Monaco from Spanish protection, instead accepting the protection of the king of France. Article 6 provided for France to recognise the prince's sovereignty over Monaco, Menton and Roquebrune. * A garrison of 500 men would permanently be stationed in the princely territory, at the expense of the royal treasury but placed under the direct orders of the prince, in order to protect the principality. In the absence of the prince, the command of the garrison would be entrusted to a lieutenant appointed by the king but approved by the prince. * As protector of the prince, his family, his privileges and his property, the king of France would pay the prince an annual rent of 75,000 livres. * With the Spanish properties of Honor√© II having been confiscated by Philip IV of Spain, the king of France granted to the prince the Duchy of Valentinois, the Marquisate of Baux, the County of Carlad√®s, the city of Chabeuil, the Baronies of Calvinet and Buis and the Lordship of Saint-R√©my-de-Provence in compensation. * The territorial clauses of the treaty were confirmed by letters patent awarded at Saint-Germain-en- Laye in February 1643.

Historical significance  Hiangtam is a small, but historic village on the Indo-Myanmar border. It is one of the oldest settlements of the Zomi community in Manipur, India. Hiangtam is best known for its association with the Kuki Rising (locally called \\"Zogal\\") during World War I. The Manlun chief Goulun of this Zou village rebelled against British colonial rule in 1917‚Äì19. The immediate cause of the uprising was forced recruitment of the natives for the Labour Corps in France. Goulun was one of the bravest zou leader and the greatest of his time.  Related place names  The local name of Churachandpur town in Manipur is Hiangtam Lamka, or generally shortened as Lamka. Though permanent settlement in Lamka began only in 1930, the British had already built a rudimentary road from Lamka to Hiangtam as part of their effort to suppress the tribal uprising - hence the term \\"Hiangtam-Lamka\\". In 1999, a new Zou settlement, Hiangzou, came into existence within Churachandpur town. The name, Hiangzou, was inspired by the historic Hingtam village further south.

Biography In the beginning of his career he worked on stage as an actor and manager. He came to the United States in January 1914, and started his film career as an assistant director to Emile Chautard at the World Film Company in Fort Lee, New Jersey. In 1917 he made his own directorial debut As Man Made Her. During the next three and a half decades he directed over one hundred films. After the beginning of the 1950s he moved to television. While working at RKO Radio Pictures in the beginning of the 1930s, he showed some artistic and skillful eye with many of his films. The finest examples include Thirteen Women (1932), a story of ethnic discrimination and revenge, with Myrna Loy as a half-caste Hindu; The Lost Squadron (1932), a memorable thriller about Hollywood stunt flyers, who risk their lives under the direction of monstrous Erich von Stroheim; Penguin Pool Murder (1932) and Murder on the Blackboard (1934), the first two films of the RKO trilogy starring Edna May Oliver as Miss Hildegarde Withers, a teacher and amateur investigator created by American writer Stuart Palmer; and later in his career the RKO drama Hunt the Man Down (1950), a film noir starring Gig Young which seems more concerned in showing the post-war transformation of seven characters since 1938, than the investigation to solve a murder case. Although Archainbaud directed films of all genres, he is nowadays mainly linked with westerns. In fact, it was not until the last decade of his directorial career until he specialized in them. With the producer Harry Sherman he made several Hopalong Cassidy oaters. Later he was also one of the principal directors of Gene Autry's Flying A Productions, at which he made several episodes for such weekly television series as Buffalo Bill, Jr., Annie Oakley and The Adventures of Champion (TV series). At the time of his death in 1959, Archainbaud had taken a position as director of the new Rory Calhoun western series, The Texan, a highly fictionalized account of the gunfighter Bill Longley, who was hanged in 1874. Calhoun's Longley, however, is a kindly person who travels through the Old West with a willingness to help the downtrodden in struggles with the lawless element. The Texan, a Desilu program which aired for two seasons on CBS, had more than a dozen directors, including Erle C. Kenton and Edward Ludwig.Billy Hathorn, \\"Roy Bean, Temple Houston, Bill Longley, Ranald Mackenzie, Buffalo Bill, Jr., and the Texas Rangers: Depictions of West Texans in Series Television, 1955 to 1967\\", West Texas Historical Review, Vol. 89 (2013), p. 111 In 1921 he married actress Katherine Johnston (1890 ‚Äì 1969), whose last film was The Flapper (1920).

The fort was built to defend the Pothohar plateau from the forces of the Pashtun king Sher Shah Suri. Location It is 17 km east of Rawalpindi on Grand Trunk Road. The 2nd century Mankiala stupa can be seen from the roof of the fort's mosque. The fort is located approximately 50 miles from the vast Rohtas Fort, which had been built by Sher Shah Suri to establish control of the Gakhar region. Etymology Rawat Fort derives is named from the Arabic word Rabat (), meaning caravanserai - an inn for caravans. History The fort was founded as a caravanserai in the 15th century by Salteen-e-Dehli, though the caravan itself may have been built atop a Ghaznavid-era fort that was established in 1036 CE. The caravanserai was then later fortified in the 16th century by the local Gakhar ‚Äì warrior clan loyal to the Mughal emperor Humayun in order to defend the Pothohar plateau from Sher Shah Suri's forces. The fort was the scene of a battle between the Gakhar chief Sultan Sarang and Afghan king Sher Shah Suri in 1546. Sarang was captured, tortured at the fort by the forces of Sher Shah Suri, and then buried at the fort. Layout The fort is almost in square form and has two gates. There is also a quadrangular building with a dome in the fort's inner area ‚Äì an area which also contains many graves. Along the perimeter are several small cells, which may have originally been small rooms rented out to itinerant merchants. The fort also contains a mosque with three domes. The grave of the Gakkar chief, Sultan Sarang Khan is present within the fort. His 16 sons, who died there fighting, are also buried inside the fort. Conservation The fort is federally protected as a Cultural Heritage Site of Punjab, and is managed by the Ministry of Information, Broadcasting and National Heritage. In November 2016, a conservation plan was commissioned for preservation of the fort. 50 million rupees were allocated in March 2017 towards the first of two phases of conservation of the Rawat Fort.

The mint was established in 1790 in Xuvia (or Jubia in Spanish spelling), a civil parish in the municipality of Neda, next to Ferrol in the province of A Coru√±a under the name of F√°brica Nacional de Cobrer√≠a, as a copper foundry. The foundry's original purpose was to support boat constructing in the shipyard at Ferrol, but during the war against the French in the Peninsular War, the site became a standard mint producing copper coins. The Casa de Moneda de Segovia was in French control at the time, minting coins in the name of Joseph Bonaparte. Xuvia, in Spanish territory, would produce coins in name of the king, Ferdinand VII of Spain. The first coins were minted in 1812, namely coins of eight Spanish maraved√≠s. In later years, coins of two and four maraved√≠s were minted in addition to one maraved√≠ in 1824. After 1815, the Xuvia mint began to lose importance as a direct result of the Casa de Moneda de Segovia beginning to re-mint coins in the name of Fernando VII. In 1819, the mint returned to manufacturing plates for the ships in the Spanish Navy and minting was brought to a complete standstill between 1827 and 1835, with manufacturing efforts directed to production of tin plates. The first decimal coinage of the monetary system entered into effect in 1850, having been officially agreed on in 1848. On August 28, 1850, Xuvia was instructed to finalize its manufacture of coinage. The last coins left the mint in September of that year. Notwithstanding, coins of 1, ¬Ω, 2¬Ω and 5 c√©ntimos were minted between 1866 and 1868. The mint was closed indefinitely in 1868, along with the mint of Segovia, and was sold at auction in 1873, later becoming a textile factory. Over half of the mint's surrounding land consists of a dense forest of eucalyptus trees, meadows and industrial areas. Various original structures have been preserved, particularly a water wheel and a canal over in length. The building itself is currently closed to the public.

It was formerly in the separate town of Over, but with the growth of Winsford it has become part of that town. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. It is an active Anglican parish church in the diocese of Chester, the archdeaconry of Chester and the deanery of Middlewich. History The church originates from the 14th century and it has been modified on a number of occasions. The original church consisted of a nave with a narrow north aisle, a wide south aisle and a chancel. The south aisle was built in 1543 by Hugh Starkie of Oulton, a gentleman usher to Henry VIII and a benefactor to Cheshire churches. In 1870 the church was restored by Ewan Christian and W. Milford Teulon. In 1897‚Äì98 the Lancaster architects Austin and Paley added vestries and an organ chamber. The north aisle was widened in 1904 by John Douglas of Chester. In about 1906 Austin and Paley carried out a further restoration; this included increasing the seating by 56, and installing heating, at an estimated cost of ¬£899. The south aisle and nave were lengthened in 1926 but the 14th-century east window was retained. Architecture =Exterior= The church is built of red sandstone ashlar with a lead roof. Its plan consists of a tower at the west end, a nave with aisles, a chancel, a vestry to the northeast, and a southeast porch. At the east end of each aisle is a chapel. The porch has two storeys, the upper projecting over the lower one. Most of the church is in Perpendicular style although the east window is Decorated. =Interior= A lavishly decorated stoup is in the porch, and Hugh Starkie's tomb lies in the sanctuary. The octagonal font is dated 1641. In the chancel is a decorated Saxon stone. This consists of a sarcophagus in a recess with a brass effigy. There are fragments of medieval and 19th-century glass in one of the north windows. Three of the stained glass windows in the north aisle are by Kempe. The two-manual organ was built by Jardine and Company in 1916, and rebuilt in 1987 by Sixsmith. The parish registers begin in 1558 and the churchwardens' accounts in 1733. =Bells= The church originally had four bells, dated 1513, but these were recast into five bells by Rudhall of Gloucester in 1733. It currently has a ring of eight bells, cast by John Taylor and Company in 1915, which were re-hung in 1938. External features Cross base in churchyard In the churchyard is a cross base dating from around 1543. It consists of a stepped octagonal base supporting the lower section of a cross shaft. It is listed Grade II. The red sandstone churchyard walls and gate piers are also listed at Grade II.

Bringing together regions from 35 countries and 15 interregional organisations, AER is a forum for interregional cooperation.  Historical background  On 15 June 1985, at Louvain-la-Neuve (Walloon Brabant), 47 Regions and 9 interregional organisations founded the Council of the Regions of Europe (CRE), which would later become the Assembly of European Regions in November 1987 at the second General meeting of the Regions of Europe in Brussels. The year 1985 was proclaimed by the United Nations as the International Youth Year. The same year AER launched its first programme, Eurodyssey, designed to promote and encourage youth mobility. In 1990, AER's Tabula Regionum Europae published the first map of its kind citing a Europe made up of regions and not simply of countries. The year after, the principle of subsidiarity became the leading AER campaign to promote the role of regions in all European and national decision-making processes. Soon thereafter its success was to be evident as the principle was recognized in the Maastricht Treaty of 1992. The creation of the Committee of the Regions (CoR) in 1994 and the Chamber of the Regions in the framework of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of Europe (CLRAE) in 1994, exemplified a victory for AER in advocating for the regions in Europe. In 1995, AER launched a campaign to promote regionalism in Europe. As a result, 300 AER members adopted in 1996 the Declaration on Regionalism in Europe immediately initializing a reference document for new and developing regions. In 2002, AER presented its position on the ‚ÄúFuture of Europe‚Äù¬ù to the European Convention. AER actively contributed to the drafting of the European Constitution, demonstrating strong political involvement. The final text included all AER proposals, namely * The recognition of the regions as an important level of governance within Europe. * The extension of the principle of subsidiarity to regional and local levels. * The inclusion of regional cohesion in EU's objectives. In 2008, AER established the Youth Regional Network, Europe's first and only platform of regional youth councils, parliaments and organisations. Definition of \\"Region\\" According to the AER statutes, in principle the term \\"region\\" refers to a territorial authority existing at the level immediately below that of the central government, with its own political representation in the form of an elected regional assembly.

Abad is considered one of the most talented post-Latin American Boom writers in Latin American literature. Abad is best known for his bestselling novel Angosta, and more recently, El Olvido que Seremos (t. Oblivion: A Memoir). Background H√©ctor Abad Faciolince was born and raised in Medell√≠n (Colombia), the only boy -among five sisters- of Cecilia Faciolince and H√©ctor Abad G√≥mez. Abad‚Äôs father was a prominent medical doctor, university professor, and human rights leader whose holistic vision of healthcare led him to found the Colombian National School of Public Health. After graduating from an Opus Dei-run private Catholic school, Abad moved to Mexico City in 1978 where his father was appointed as Cultural Counselor of the Colombian Embassy in Mexico. While in Mexico, he attended literature, creative writing and poetry workshops at La Casa del Lago, the first off campus cultural center of the National Autonomous University of Mexico. In 1979, Abad moved back to Medell√≠n and pursued studies in Philosophy and Literature at the Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana. Later in 1982, he was expelled from the University for writing an irreverent article against the Pope. He then moved to Italy and completed studies on Modern Languages and Literature at the University of Turin in 1986. Abad graduated with the highest academic honors of summa cum laude, and his thesis on Guillermo Cabrera Infante's 1967 novel Tres tristes tigres was also awarded \\"Dignit√° di Stampa\\" (a special distinction that literally means \\"worthy of publication\\"). Abad returned to his home town in Colombia in 1987, but later that year his father was murdered by the paramilitaries in a crime that brought about shock in Colombia. Abad himself was threatened with death and had to fly back immediately to Europe; first to Spain and finally to Italy, where he established his residence for the next five years. While in Italy, Abad worked as a lecturer of Spanish at the University of Verona until 1992. At this time, he also earned a living translating literary works from Italian to Spanish. His translations of Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa‚Äôs The Siren and Selected Writings, Gesualdo Bufalino‚Äôs Qui Pro Quo and Umberto Eco‚Äôs Annotations to The Name of the Rose have been well received critically. He has also translated numerous works by Italo Calvino, Leonardo Sciascia, Primo Levi, and Natalia Ginzburg. Upon returning to Colombia, Abad was appointed director of the University of Antioquia Journal (1993‚Äì1997). Abad has been columnist for prestigious newspapers and magazines in Colombia, such as Revista Cromos, La Hoja, El Malpensante, Revista Semana, and Revista Cambio, the last co-founded by the Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning Colombian author Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez. He has also worked as a journalist for the newspapers El Mundo, El Colombiano, and El Espectador. He is a regular contributor to other Latin American and Spanish papers and magazines. Abad has been a guest speaker at a number of universities worldwide, including Columbia University, Pennsylvania State University, University of Verona, University of Turin, University of Cagliari, University of Bologna, and University of Florence. He has also been seasonal lecturer at the Universit√† del Piemonte Orientale in Vercelli. Awarded the prestigious German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) fellowship, Abad lived in Berlin from 2006 to 2007. He later returned to Medell√≠n and was appointed editor-in-chief of the EAFIT University Press. Since May 2008, Abad has been a member of the editorial board of El Espectador, the oldest newspaper in Colombia. Abad is an atheist. Writing Abad started his literary career at a very young age. He was just 12 years old when he wrote his first short stories and poetry works. Abad was twenty one years of age when he was awarded the 1980 Colombian National Short Story Prize for Piedras de Silencio (t. Stones of Silence), a short story about a miner trapped deep underground. While still in Italy, he published his first book, Malos Pensamientos (1991) but it was only upon returning to Colombia in 1993, that Abad become a full- time writer. Abad forms part of a new generation of authors that emerges in Colombia beyond magical realism. Among a notably circle of new Colombian writers such as Santiago Gamboa, Jorge Franco, Laura Restrepo, and others(1), Abad‚Äôs literary works often focus on the personality of the narrator and the act of narration in its pursuit of protection and power. The richness, plot, irony, permanent enticement of the reader, the intensity of his stories, as well as the seriousness of the social, historical, and human research behind his confessional narrative, stand Abad as a brilliant recreator of the contemporary Colombian society through literature. Malos Pensamientos (1991) is a sort of James Joyce‚Äôs Dubliners short tales that offer vivid, witty, and tightly focused observations of Medell√≠n‚Äôs everyday life back in the eighties. Asuntos de un Hidalgo Disoluto (1994; Eng. The Joy of Being Awake, 1996) deliberately models itself on two key 18th-century works: Laurence Sterne's Tristram Shandy and Voltaire's Candide. Like Sterne's eccentric novel, The Joy of Being Awake is a bittersweet account of the life and opinions of a man at odds with himself, narrated in nonchronological fashion with plenty of entertaining digressions and the occasional formal game. Narrated by a character who is a 71-year-old Colombian millionaire, this work is a Colombian version of the Spanish picaresque novel. Writing at the end of his life, the narrator looks back on his life of debauchery ‚Äì and the failure of his high pretensions ‚Äì through reminiscences to his younger mute secretary and lover, Cunegunda Bonaventura. The narrator often gives two versions of a memory: first what he wishes had happened and then what really happened. Abad's novel has a surface geniality that barely conceals undercurrents of discontent and despair.(2) This novel is considered as one of the better works of fiction to appear recently in Colombia. Tratado de Culinaria para Mujeres Tristes (1996; t: Recipes for Sad Women) is a book of uncertain literary genre that combines a collection of false recipes (coelacanth, dinosaur, or mammoth meat) with real recipes. The book is neither a novel nor a collection of recipes, but rather a collection of sensitive short reflections about unhappiness. With a love for droll turns of phrase, Abad blends melancholy with even-seasoned irony in well-composed sentences. Fragmentos de Amor Furtivo (1998; t: Fragments of Furtive Love). adopts the framework of the book of One Thousand and One Nights in modified form. Every night, a woman delays her lover's departure by telling him stories of her past lovers. As a background, Abad portraits a 1990s middle-class Medell√≠n as a city besieged by pestilence and disenchantment, the most violent city in the world, where the intensity of violence buried its inhabitants alive. As in the Decameron, Susana and Rodrigo lock themselves up in the hills, far away from the city pestilence, and tell each other stories that would save them from death. Basura (2000; t: Garbage) is perhaps Abad‚Äôs most experimental work. It alludes to role models, such as the storytellers Kafka or Pavese who were angst ridden for life, and tells of a writer, Bernardo Davanzati, who tosses his works directly into the garbage can. His neighbour finds the texts and over time turns into an assiduous and diligent reader, to whom the many woes of being a writer are revealed. The act of writing and the role of the reader in literature are topics which are highlighted time and again. Palabras sueltas (2002; t. Loose Words) is a book of brief cultural and political essays that were compiled from Abad‚Äôs most successful columns written for newspapers and cultural magazines. Oriente Empieza en El Cairo (2002; t. East begins in Cairo) is a fascinating chronicle of a man‚Äôs voyage around the milenary Egypt. The narrator, accompanied by two wives, depicts two versions of the everyday reality of a mythical mega-city that brings memories of other realities, images, and stories lived in distant Medell√≠n. Angosta (2004). Echoes of Hyperrealism rather than Magic Realism are clearly present in this award-winning novel. In a fantastical parable of Colombian society, Abad describes a fictitious city whose population has been divided into three different castes living in separate sectors. Against the backdrop of the violent perpetuation of this system, a kaleidoscope of eccentrics from the ruling class is depicted. The novel recreates Colombia‚Äôs last years of violence with enormous synthetic capacity, complexity and efficiency, and a great deal of knowledge about the conflict. Abad provides us with one of the very best novels on the second wave of violence during the twentieth century in Colombia.(4) In March 2007, the Colombian magazine Semana published a list of the best work of fiction written in Spanish over the last 25 years. Among the thirty books to have received multiple votes was Abad's Angosta. El Olvido que Seremos (2006; t. Oblivion: A Memoir). It took Abad nearly 20 years to get the courage to write this book about his father, his life and the circumstances of his murder by Colombian paramilitaries. The result is a cathartic and sentimental‚Äîbut not clich√©d‚Äîaccount of a man who fought against oppression, and social inequality and whose voice was shut down by six bullets in the head. The narration itself‚Äîwhich focuses more on the father‚Äôs activism and the father figure per se than on the man himself‚Äîwas a process for the author; Abad goes beyond memory, opening up his own feelings and responses to his loss and depicts his father as the symbol of the ongoing fight against injustice, thus, illuminating and strengthening the Colombian memory. Las Formas de la Pereza y Otros Ensayos (2007; t. The Forms of Laziness and Other Essays) is a book about the origin and manifestations of laziness. The author‚Äôs hypothesis is that laziness would not be a luxury but the original condition of human existence, and the starting point of all subsequent human creations. An extensive bibliography about his writings has been prepared by Professor Augusto Escobar Mesa from the University of Antioquia, and the Universit√© de Montr√©al. = Columnist = Abad started to write in Newspapers and Magazines since he was in school and later when he was in college. After college, he wrote in newspapers such as El Espectador and continued for more than 15 years. In Abad‚Äôs writings, one can see his incisive character when writing about controversial subjects such as globalization, religi√≥n, corruption, etc. Jim√©nez confirms that one can see the reoccurring themes in Abad‚Äôs columns, which are: rhetoric, personal themes, writing jobs, literary structures, phobias, science, against globalization, Medell√≠n and religion. In the newspaper El Espectador, Faciolince publishes a weekly column where he clearly expresses his opinion. By doing this, he allows one to see sections that talk about writing and grammar in the 21st century Faciolince, in collaborations in literature magazines like El Malpensante, exhibits his critical view of literature, what he considers to be a good writer and a good book. One can find articles like Por qu√© es tan malo Paulo Coelho, where one can infer things such as: > If Coelho sells more books than all of the other Brazilian writers combined, > then that means his books are foolish and elementary. If they were profound > books, literarily complex, with serious ideas and well elaborated, the > public would not buy them because the masses tend to be uneducated and have > very bad taste.Abad Faciolince, H√©ctor (2003). ¬´Por qu√© es tan malo Paulo > Coelho¬ª. El Malpensante (50 noviembre-diciembre). Abad does not try to be a best-seller but creates complete characters like Gaspar Medina in the novel Asuntos de un hidalgo disoluto, where one can see Medina's periodization of being a hidalgo and dissolute.V√©lez, M (1999).

For scoring two-thirds of the possible points, he was automatically awarded the International Master title, and as winner of the event, qualified for the Interzonal tournament the next year. The Interzonal at Rio de Janeiro was his first top-class international event, and H√©bert finished with 4.5/17, thus sharing last place, with the title won by Robert H√ºbner, Lajos Portisch, and Tigran Petrosian. In his Canadian Zonal title defence at Montreal 1981, H√©bert scored 10.5/15, but could only tie for 2nd-3rd, behind winner Igor V. Ivanov.the Jean H√©bert player file  At the Olympiads  H√©bert has represented Canada a total of seven times at Chess Olympiads from 1978-2002\\\\. His first two appearances, in 1978 and 1980, saw Canada score its highest team placings ever, with eleventh and ninth-place finishes, respectively. In 72 games, he has scored (+25 =25 -22), for 52.1 per cent. Here are his detailed Olympiad results.Men's Chess Olympiads; Hebert, Jean, www.olimpbase.org * Buenos Aires 1978, board 1, 4/11 (+2 =4 -5); * Valletta 1980, board 1, 7/12 (+4 =6 -2); * Merano 1982, board 3, 8.5/12 (+7 =3 -2), board bronze medal; * Thessaloniki 1984, board 2, 6.5/12 (+5 =3 -4); * Novi Sad 1990, board 2, 2.5/7 (+2 =1 -4); * Yerevan 1996, board 3, 7/12 (+4 =6 -2); * Bled 2002, 2nd reserve, 2/6 (+1 =2 -3).  Correspondence chess Grandmaster  H√©bert has also excelled at correspondence chess. He placed second in the 1976 Canadian Correspondence Championship, and was a member of the bronze-medal winning Canadian team in the 11th ICCF Olympiad. H√©bert was awarded the title of International Grandmaster of Correspondence Chess by ICCF in 1984.  Quebec successes  H√©bert has enjoyed considerable success in Quebec provincial championships, at both the Open and Closed levels, as well as in other home-based events. He won the 1980 Montreal Invitational with 6/8, and drew an exhibition match 2-2 with Kevin Spraggett that year. H√©bert faced Spraggett again in a playoff match in 1982, after the two had tied for 2nd-3rd places in the 1981 Zonal, for a reserve place in the Interzonal. This time Spraggett prevailed by 3.5-0.5. H√©bert shared 2nd-3rd places in the Quebec Closed at Montreal 1983 with 6/9, behind Spraggett. He shared 1st-2nd places in the 1985 Quebec Closed on 8.5/11 with George Levtchouk. H√©bert placed tied 3rd-4th in the 1985 Canadian Chess Championship with 6.5/9, as Ivanov and Sylvain Barbeau shared the top spots. He finished 2nd in the Quebec Closed 1988 with 8.5/11 behind Ivanov. H√©bert won the 1990 Quebec Closed with 7.5/9.Quebec 1990, www.365chess.com He shared first in the 2002 Canadian Open Chess Championship at Montreal, with 8/10. H√©bert has won the Quebec Open Chess Championship five times (1989, 1990, 1994, 2002, 2005), and this ties the record for the most titles in that event.David Cohen's Canadian Chess site.  Legacy and writings  H√©bert is the first Canadian Francophone chess player to establish a solid international reputation, by playing in the 1979 Interzonal, and with his seven chess Olympiad appearances, earning a bronze medal in 1982. He was the first Francophone Canadian Chess Championship winner since 1884, and only the second ever. He is also the first Canadian Francophone to earn the correspondence Grandmaster title, and is one of the few players to achieve international titles at both over-the-board and correspondence chess. His writings have included these works: * Karpov -- Korchnoi 1978 (in French); * Border Wars III; * Le√ßons d'√©checs du Tournoi International de Montr√©al 2001 (Chess'n Math Association in French); * Le Livre du Tournoi International de Montr√©al 2002 (Chess'n Math Association in French); * Modern Benoni CD ChessBase. H√©bert has been a respected commentator at major chess matches and events, such as the 1989 Quebec City Candidates' encounter between Kevin Spraggett and Artur Yusupov. He served as Editor for the magazine Echecs+, published by the Quebec Chess Federation. He was the chess columnist for La Presse (Canada), has written articles for New In Chess, and published the magazine Au Nom du Roi, which has since been replaced by his own online newsletter. He served for a time as a columnist and games analyst with Chess Canada magazine. H√©bert was inducted into the Canadian Chess Hall of Fame in 2001. After reaching the Canadian title at age 20 in 1978, H√©bert, in spite of his own significant improvement after that time, was surpassed in Canadian chess by 1980 Soviet defector Igor V. Ivanov, and also by Kevin Spraggett, over whom he had at first had the edge.  Competitive resurgence  H√©bert has scaled back his top-class play in recent years, but still competes in a few events each year, and showed, at the age of nearly fifty, that he remained a competitive force with his first-place tie in the 2007 Canadian Championship at Kitchener, Ontario. He surpassed that performance in August, 2009 at Guelph, Ontario, when he won the 2009 Canadian Chess Championship with a score of 7.5/9, a full point ahead of runner-up Grandmaster Mark Bluvshtein; this victory made him, at the age of nearly fifty-two, the oldest Canadian champion ever. Also in 2009, he won the Quebec Closed (January) and the Montreal Open (September).

It is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International Inc known as Honeywell Aerospace Yeovil (HAY). NGL Canberra advertisement The company originally grew out of the Westland Aircraft Company who in 1933 enabled the Houston Everest expedition to make the first ever flight over Mount Everest, using oxygen and heating systems ‚Äì precursors of the systems that would eventually be produced by Normalair. Westland Aircraft produced a cabin pressurisation control valve in 1941 for use in the Westland Welkin high altitude fighter bomber aircraft. Though the Welkin never got into full-scale production the same valve was used in Mosquito, Wellington and Spitfire aircraft. Formation At the end of World War II, Westland had decided to focus on building helicopters, for which their high altitude technology was of no use; and on 15 March 1946 Normalair Limited was established on the Westland site in Yeovil. Ted Boulger was appointed general manager. with J Fearn appointed as Westland Board Director with responsibility for the new company. During the 1950s the company grew and continued to focus upon providing equipment that would allow aviators to operate at high altitude. In 1951 the company signed an agreement with the Eclipse Pioneer division of Bendix Aviation, now also owned by Honeywell, to manufacture and modify oxygen breathing regulators for aircrew. During this period, the Royal Aircraft Establishment gave the company responsibility for all military oxygen work and as a result acquired complete life support systems capability including oxygen masks and emergency oxygen supply. In anticipation of the long range support needed by the de Havilland Comet Normalair set up subsidiaries in Melbourne, Australia and in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The company employed 250 people in 1954 and in the same year produced LOX (Liquid Oxygen) converters for the German Air Force, F-86 Sabre. Diversification In 1957 the publication of Duncan Sandys' Defence White Paper led to the cancellation of many aircraft projects. The company decided to diversify into other markets and took a licence from Dr√§gerwerke, of Germany, to produce compressed air diving and oxygen breathing apparatus. Normalair achieved most success with portable oxygen systems, including the equipment supplied for the first successful ascent, by Tenzing and Hillary, of Mount Everest. Relatively short-lived was Normalair's entry into the automotive air conditioning market, where the systems were optional extras on Wolseley Wolseley 6/110, Austin Westminster 110, Vanden Plas Princess, Land Rovers and some Rolls-Royces. However the company was some thirty years too early as demand for air conditioned cars in Europe did not materialise; the company withdrew from the market in 1964. In 1960, further agreements with Bendix brought licensed production of hydraulic servo valves to Normalair's range of products. This expertise was then developed for electro-hydraulic servo valves, actuators and lightweight solenoid-operated hydraulic valves. The company also produced marine hydraulics and valves for submarines. Also in 1960, the Industrial Electronics Division was formed to use data logging technology brought from Saunders-Roe, when parent company Westland took them over. At the same time the company was involved with development and production of regulators for Harrier and UK Phantom aircraft. Normalair's high altitude laboratory included a chamber large enough to accommodate a full size mock-up of the Concorde fuselage. This was used for trials simulating the effects of supersonic cruise at up to 60,000 ft, nearly twice the operating altitude of contemporary airliners. As well as conducting these tests, Normalair developed the cabin pressure control equipment providing a comfortable environment for passengers. Garrett Corporation shareholding The company won a Queens Award to Industry for Export in 1966. The Garrett Corporation took a 48% shareholding in the company, which was subsequently renamed Normalair-Garrett Limited (NGL). At this time the company had more than 1,300 employees. NGL took over one of its main competitors, Teddington Aircraft Controls, in 1971. In the same year the company also acquired Aircraft Supplies Limited of Bournemouth, whose premises were used to set up NGL's product support activities. The company had entered into numerous license agreements during its history, and in this year it agreed to license manufacture of oxygen and environmental control systems to Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, of India, for production of the HJT 16 aircraft. Several major contracts were won in 1972 to supply the Multi Role Combat Aircraft (MRCA) later to be named Panavia Tornado. In the same year the company acquired the Westland foundry business in Hayes and transferred it to the Drayton Hydroflex premises in Chard, Somerset. In that year also, Julian Knott set the world altitude record for a hot air balloon of 35,971 ft using a balloon supplied with NGL oxygen equipment. NGL won several contracts in 1974 to supply the HS146 regional jet, now called the BAe 146 with air conditioning and air systems management equipment. Diversification continued with the purchase of Facet Enterprises filtration licenses from Voles in 1976. In the same year Normalair‚Äôs filtration division was formed in the former glove making factory at Shepton Beauchamp, where it remained for ten years before being moved to the Lynx Trading Estate in Yeovil near to the main plant. The last vapour cycle air conditioning systems developed by Normalair were fitted to export versions of Alvis Stormer and Scorpion armoured vehicles, and the Khaled tank (a version of the Centurion sold in the Middle East). The company later opted out of making vapour cycle systems to concentrate on air cycle systems only. This decision was to be vindicated 15 years later when the Montreal Protocol saw the end of Chlorofluorocarbon and FC based systems. In 1977 NGL began development of its first in-house designed aircraft data recorder, a sealed maintenance recorder for the McDonnell Douglas (now Boeing) F/A-18 Hornet A/B. The recorder had to meet unprecedented environmental and accuracy specifications, and was Normalair‚Äôs first order for US defence equipment. The F/A-18 unit placed Normalair at the forefront of aircraft recorder technology and a dedicated electronics division was set up at Clarence Street, near to the former Huish football ground. The height of Normalair‚Äôs fame came with the appearance of the Deep Dive 500 closed circuit breathing system (scuba set) which appeared in the James Bond film For Your Eyes Only. The system minimised the emission of bubbles which made it suitable for covert naval operations. Notes References * Celebrating fifty years of Normalair ‚Äì A brief history. M.P.

The site has the oldest known stone buildings in Magna Germania. The archaeological evidence at Waldgirmes suggests the remains of one of a series of planned towns and market places founded by the Romans east of the Rhine and north of the Danube, with the aim of long-term growth into population centres. The complex was never completed. In the absence of any historical reference or local inscriptions, the original name of the site remains unknown.  History  Drusus and was located ca. 100 km southeast of Colonia Since Theodor Mommsen, it had been assumed that Roman operations in Greater Germania were limited to exploratory expeditions, and small temporary trading stations. This was despite Cassius Dio's (56,18,2) reference to the foundation of some cities during the governorship of Varus. Waldgirmes appears to have been one such place, designed to trade with the Germanic population and to supply Roman troops. The Celtic oppidum of \\"D√ºnsberg\\", abandoned around 20 BC, was about 20 km from the new site. Waldgirmes appears to have been a planned new foundation on a virgin site. Dendrochronological study of the wooden wall indicates that the trees providing the wood was felled around 4 BC. Thus, the settlement's construction probably started before that time. Its location, on a spur of land jutting into the Lahn river, was highly defensible. Additionally, it would have been possible to reach areas of established Roman presence along the Rhine (like Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium and Castra Vetera) relatively quickly by boat. The existence of the oversized forum at the centre of the site suggests that it may have been intended to form the core settlement of a future civitas, an important part of a projected Romanisation of the area. It is possible that Wardgimes was going to be a colonia for legio veterans, because no barracks and no military equipment have been found in the recent excavationsLivius:Waldgirmes The site remained unfinished, indicated by the large undeveloped areas. Following the battle of the Teutoburg Forest, when virtually all Roman military posts east of the Rhine were lost, Waldgirmes was abandoned. The finds suggest that this was intentional: between 9 and 16 AD, during the period of Roman punitive expeditions, the site was occasionally used as a military camp. After that, it was destroyed by the Roman army. A Romano-German city? Map of the Roman province of Germania showing Marktbreit The site has the oldest known stone buildings in Magna Germania. The archaeological evidence at Waldgirmes suggests the remains of one of a series of planned towns and market places founded by the Romans east of the Rhine and north of the Danube, with the aim of long-term growth into population centers of the newly created province of Germania. The complex was never completed. In the absence of any historical reference or local inscriptions, the original name of the site remains unknown.  Archaeological evidence and finds  Statue of the emperor Augustus (replica) Roman Horsehead of Waldgirmes displayed in the Saalburg museum, Bad Homburg, Germany. Found in 2009. The area, just northwest of Waldgirmes and at the eastern city limit of Wetzlar, has been the subject of archaeological excavation since 1993. The remains discovered include an impressive forum, on one side of which stood a stone-built central building or basilica, flanked by two apses, Further structures were built using the Roman half-timbered technique on stone foundations. Their roofs were of wooden slates. The complex was surrounded by a wooden palisade with a double ditch and three gates to the west, east and south. The location of what would have been the northern gate was taken by a tower. From the outside, it would have looked like a Roman military fort, but its interior contained a trading centre with a market, two crossing streets with central channels for drainage or water supplies, stables, storage buildings, taverns and houses with wooden porticos. By 2004, 24 house floorplans and a well of 4 m depth had been excavated. No temple has been discovered, a fact that may be explained by the short duration of activity at the site. Everything found resembles a higher-status Roman settlement; nothing is reminiscent of Germanic or Celtic traditions. One of the most important finds is 200 fragments of a life-sized gilded bronze equestrian statue, probably of Augustus, discovered in and around the central building and surrounding settlement. Other important finds include a glass seal with a depiction of Niobe, a mosaic glass bead depicting Apis, several other pieces of jewellery, and some unworked amber. The pottery found was predominantly Roman, simple handmade Germanic material made up only about 20% of the total ceramics. Apparently, different ethnic groups inhabited the site side-by-side. Coins found date activity at Waldgirmes to between 5 BC and 9 AD, the year of the Battle of Teutoburg Forest.

She departed New York on 8 April 1861 and arrived off Charleston Bar on the 15th, a few hours after Major Robert Anderson's command had evacuated the fort and embarked in Federal transport Baltic. On the 20th, Yankee assisted in the evacuation of the Norfolk Navy Yard, Norfolk, Virginia, towing to safety. She then returned to the New York Navy Yard.  Performing reconnaissance duty  Yankee left the navy yard on the 26 April 1861 for duty as a dispatch and escort vessel between Annapolis, Maryland, and Havre de Grace, Maryland. On 30 April 1861, she received orders to Hampton Roads for reconnaissance duty between the Rip Raps and Cape Henry, Virginia. Batteries manned by Virginia forces that had not yet been formally incorporated into the Confederate States Army at Gloucester Point, Virginia, fired upon Yankee on 7 May 1861,Sources differ as to whether this action took place on 7, 8 May or 9, 1861, but the reports of the commanding officers clearly state that the engagement took place on 7 May.

Yankee returned fire with four shots and two shells but the crew could not elevate its guns high enough to reach the shore batteries and Yankee broke off the action and returned to Hampton Roads. After further reconnaissance duty along the eastern shore of Virginia and the James River, Yankee proceeded to the Washington Navy Yard on 25 May 1861 to deliver prize schooners General Knox and Georgeanna. She sailed for Hampton Roads on the last day of May 1861 and arrived on 2 June 1861 but was sent north a week later for major repairs at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. On 2 July 1861, Yankee departed Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, bound via the Washington Navy Yard for Hampton Roads.

Yankee participated in the capture of the strong Confederate position at Hill's Point, Virginia, on the Nansemond River on 20 April 1863, even though the armed tug's length and draft impaired her maneuverability. She returned to the Rappahannock River on 1 May 1863. During duty on the Rappahannock, Yankee captured the schooner Cassandra and her cargo of whiskey and soda on 11 July 1863. She took the schooner Nanjemoy in the Coan River, Virginia, on 15 July 1863; and captured the sloop Clara Ann on 1 August 1863.

The line, about long, opened in 1880, connecting the York‚ÄìScarborough line of the North Eastern Railway to a large freight depot in the Foss Islands area of the city.  Freight traffic  Much of the traffic on the branch line served the Rowntree's factory on Haxby Road. In the Foss Islands area, there were sidings to: * the York Gas Company's premises near Monk Bridge * a York Corporation depot that included a power station and a refuse destructor, and * the Navigation Warehouse belonging to Leetham's Mills at the junction of the River Foss and Wormald's Cut * the British Transport Hotels laundry  Passenger service  A minor passenger service (not shown in public timetables) was provided from 1927 onwards to a small station called Rowntree Halt south of the factory and close to the junction of the branch with the Scarborough line. This allowed Rowntree workers from areas south of York such as Selby and Doncaster to commute directly to the factory, and was also used for works visits and workers' excursions. The halt officially closed on 8 July 1989.  Connection to the DVLR  The Foss Islands end of the branch line was connected with the new Derwent Valley Light Railway's northern terminus at York (Layerthorpe) railway station when it opened in 1913.  Final years  After the DVLR closed in 1981, freight generated by the Rowntree factory ensured the survival of the Foss Islands branch for eight more years and it was finally closed in 1989 with the tracks being lifted in 1992.

He was removed from the Ministry of Interior Affairs by Hamid Karzai in the wake of attacks on the June 2010 Afghan Peace Jirga.\\"Afghan interior, intel chiefs replaced over attack\\" Before that he worked with several international humanitarian organisations and served as Minister of Rural Rehabilitation and Development and Minister of Education. In 2011, he was part of the Right and Justice party. During his time in office, he has visited several countries to get funding to stabilise Afghanistan. Atmar served as the National Security Advisor to Ashraf Ghani from 2014 to 2018, when he resigned due to disagreement with Ghani on certain issues. In late 2018, Atmar announced his candidacy for the April 2019 presidential elections, indicating he firmly believes a peace deal with the Taliban is possible. He later withdrew his candidature. In April 2020, he was appointed as the foreign minister. Early life Atmar was born in 1968 as son of Mohammad Asef Atmar in Laghman Province of Afghanistan. He is an ethnic Pashtun. As a young adult, he worked for the KHAD, an Afghan security and intelligence agency with strong ties to the Soviet KGB, including with a special-operations unit. During the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War he fought against Mujahids, and lost a leg defending Jalalabad in 1987. Atmar left for the United Kingdom after the fall of Kabul. Studies and humanitarian work In the UK he earned two degrees at the University of York: a diploma in Information Technology and Computers, and an M.A. in Public Policy, International Relations and Post-war Reconstruction studies, which he studied for from 1996 to 1997. He speaks fluent Pashto, Dari, English, Urdu, and Hindi. In 1992 Atmar began advising on Afghanistan and Pakistan for humanitarian agencies, which he would continue for two years. Following that he went to the Norwegian Church Aid, where he served as Program Manager for six years until 2001. That same year he was hired as the Deputy Director General of the International Rescue Committee for Afghanistan, but after the September 11th attacks, the 2001 U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, and the Bonn Agreement creating an Afghan Transitional Authority under Hamid Karzai, Atmar left to join the new government. Political career =Minister of Rural Rehabilitation and Development= In 2002, Atmar was invited to join the Transitional Government as the Minister of Rural Rehabilitation & Development and was confirmed with the same portfolio in the cabinet of the newly elected President Karzai in December 2004. As one of the youngest members of cabinet and a technocrat, he directed his energies into transforming a dysfunctional and non-descript ministry into one of national significance that reached into every province of the country, overseeing an annual budget of nearly 500 million dollars at the end of his four-year tenure. Ercan Murat, Country Director for UNDP in Afghanistan described Atmar in 2004 as a human development champion. As head of a ministry that was considered a key consumer of international funds, his task entailed providing food security for the rural population, safe drinking water, alternatives for the drug-economy and building the necessary infrastructure for the economy in rural areas to develop. =Minister of Education= In May 2006, Atmar was sworn in as the Minister of Education after being approved by an overwhelming majority of the National Assembly. As one of the very few who has served in successive cabinets under President Karzai, he went equipped with valuable institutional experience and memory to take on challenge of making available one of the most basic rights denied to a generation of Afghans‚Äîeducation. Atmar with Afghan well-known poet, author-writer and Director of the ECAR Massoud Nawabi at the Education Ministry of Afghanistan in Kabul As a member of the Presidential Oversight Committee, Atmar provides valuable advice and input into the development of the Afghanistan National Development Strategy and the represents government on the Joint Monitoring and Coordination Board that tracks the implementation of the Afghanistan Compact. =Minister of Interior= U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and U.S. Navy admiral Michael Mullen at the Pentagon in Washington, D.C.

Her grandfather was Carlos Manuel de C√©spedes, who is the father of the nation of Cuba, and a distant cousin was Perucho Figueredo. She was married to Francesco Bounous of the Italian foreign service. Her work De C√©spedes worked as a journalist in the 1930s for Piccolo, Epoca, and La Stampa. In 1935, she wrote her first novel, L‚ÄôAnima Degli Altri. Her fiction writing was greatly influenced by the cultural developments that lead to and resulted from World War II. In her writing, she instills her female characters with subjectivity. In her work, there is a recurring motif of women judging the rightness or wrongness of their actions. In 1935, she was jailed for her anti-fascist activities in Italy. Two of her novels were also banned (Nessuno Torna Indietro (1938) and La Fuga (1940)). In 1943, she was again imprisoned for her assistance with Radio Partigiana in Bari where she was a Resistance radio personality known as Clorinda. From June 1952 to the late 1958 she wrote an agony column, called Dalla parte di lei, in the magazine Epoca. She wrote the screenplay for the Michelangelo Antonioni 1955 film Le Amiche. Her work was also part of the literature event in the art competition at the 1936 Summer Olympics. After the war she went to live in Paris.

Family background Sir Claude Corea came from a leading Sri Lankan family who hail from the western coast town of Chilaw. They played a pivotal role in the independence movement of Ceylon, setting up the hugely influential Chilaw Association. Mahatma Gandhi recognised the role played by the Corea Family when he visited Chilaw in 1927 on his first and only visit to the island. He was born on 29 January 1894 to a well known Ceylonese political family hailing from the Western seaboard town of Chilaw. His father was Alfred Winzer Corea who was an officer in government police and his mother was Sarah Elizabeth Herat. In the late 19th Century the Corea brothers, wealthy landed proprietors, set up the Chilaw Association, as a political action group. Sir Claude married Lilie Karmini Chitty (born 1889), daughter of James Morel Chitty, Crown Counsellor and son of Christian S. Chitty of 42 Silversmith St., Kotahena and Chilaw and his French Huguenot wife, Matilda Augusta \\"Mitzi\\" Morel. Lady Corea sported a diamond nose stud and is reported famously to have responded to a journalist's query as to why she wore a diamond on her nose thus: \\"I prefer diamonds to sapphires\\". The journalist had been visiting the United Nations at the time. The Clementine Paddleford papers in the Kansas State University Archives and Manuscripts have an intriguing entry: \\"Corea, Lady Karmini, wife to Sir Claude Corea, Ceylon's, United Nations Ambassador ‚Äì 'A Fashion Note at U.N.,‚Äô n.d\\". under \\"People, 1932‚Äì1967\\". Lady Corea played an important role in Sir Claude's career as a diplomat. He was educated at Wesley College, Colombo. Early political career Sir Claude enjoyed an illustrious political career in wartime Ceylon, entering politics and the State Council in 1931. He acted as Minister of Home Affairs in 1933, becoming Minister of Labour, Industry and Commerce in 1936, coincidentally with his marriage to Lilie Karmani Chitty. He continued as Minister of Labour, Industry and Commerce until 1946. He was elected to the presidency of the Ceylon National Congress in 1932, 1939 and 1941. Sir Claude Corea was a prominent member of the State Council of Ceylon. He was appointed Minister of Home Affairs in 1933 and Minister of Labour, Industry and Commerce in 1936. The State Council met in what is now known as the Old Parliament Building in Colombo, Sri Lanka. On the last occasion, during the Second World War, Sir Claude was adamant that the CNC should not lobbying for \\"mere constitutional reforms\\", but should seek transfer of sovereignty to the people of Ceylon. After the war Sir Claude served as chairman of the board of Ministers Sub Committee charged with resolving post-war problems. He was viewed as a potential first prime minister of Ceylon. However Don Stephen Senanayake was keener on this position than he; Sir Claude opted for a diplomatic career. Diplomatic career Sir Claude took up the post of Ceylonese Representative in the United Kingdom in 1946, two years prior to independence. It is as a diplomat par excellence that he is remembered. His contribution as a diplomat has given him legendary status among the cognoscenti. Sir Claude was soon commissioned by Don Stephen Senanayake, the first Prime Minister, to undertake diplomatic missions in the United States. He was appointed as the first Ceylonese Ambassador to the United States in 1948. Records in the Truman Library reveal that Sir Claude visited the President on 1 March 1949 and again on 21 July 1952, the dates roughly marking his period as Ambassador of Ceylon in the United States.Truman Library ‚Äì Dean Acheson, Memos of Conversation Index During this period he attended the 5th session of FAO in Washington DC from 21 November to 6 December 1949. Sir Claude was appointed as High Commissioner of Ceylon in United Kingdom in 1954. He was given concurrent accreditation to France and the Netherlands in January 1956. He served as High Commissioner at the Court of St. James until 1958. =Post-war relations with Japan= Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida and members of the Japanese delegation, sign the Peace Treaty of San Francisco in 1951. Sir Claude Corea, together with J. R. Jayewardene and R. G. Senanayake, signed the treaty on behalf of Ceylon. On 8 September 1951, the Treaty of Peace with Japan was signed in San Francisco. Junius Richard Jayewardene (later President Jayewardene), Sir Claude Corea and R. G. Senanayake signed on behalf of Ceylon. J. R. Jayewardene and Sir Claude, kinsmen and colleagues, worked closely with Dean Acheson and John Foster Dulles, on the American side, to stem an undercurrent at the meeting of Asian resentment against Japanese wartime aggression. President Reagan made reference to this at the welcoming ceremony for President J. R. Jayewardene on the White House Lawn on 18 June 1984. He said \\"understanding and appreciating your personal commitment to democratic ideals, Mr. President, it is a pleasure for us to have you as our guest. You underscored this heartfelt commitment during your first visit here in September 1951, during a gathering of the representatives of nations who had fought in the Pacific war. Some at that San Francisco conference insisted that Japan should not be given its full freedom. They argued that Japan should remain shackled as a punishment for its role in World War II. As the representative of Sri Lanka, you spoke out for the principle of freedom for all people, including the Japanese. You quoted Buddha, the great teacher, and said that \\"hatred ceases not by hatred, but by love.\\" =Multilateral diplomacy= He was drawn increasingly into multilateral diplomacy in this period, being appointed as Chairman of the UN Interim Committee on International Commodity Arrangements of GATT at its 10th session, in 1955 ‚Äì having been associated with GATT from its inception.http://www.wto.int/gatt_docs/English/SULPDF/90270403.pdf Ceylon only became a member of the United Nations on 14 December 1955. In August 1956 he participated in the 22-power London conference that discussed the brewing Suez Crisis, before travelling to China. On 8 September 1956 he arrived in Beijing as Special Ambassador to China, at the head of a Ceylon Government Delegation that was to have preliminary discussions with the Government of the People's Republic of China regarding the establishment of diplomatic relations, trade expansion, economic co-operation and cultural exchanges. The delegation included Sir Susantha de Fonseka, K.B.E., Mr. T.B.Subasinghe, M.P., Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Defence and External Affairs and Mr. R. Coomaraswamy, Senior Assistant Secretary, Ministry of Finance. Mr Coomaraswamy subsequently became Deputy Administrator of UNDP and the other two members became cabinet ministers. The Suez Crisis boiled over after this Chinese interlude, in the period 5 November to 22 December 1956. Sir Claude chaired the 12th session of GATT in October 1957 in the Palais des Nations in Geneva. He was next appointed as Representative to the United Nations in June 1958 and was in office in September of that year when Prime Minister Solomon W. R. D. Bandaranaike was assassinated in Ceylon. Among those who called to offer condolences were Mr. Vazili Kuzanesov, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister and Mr. V. K. Krishna Menon, India's Defence Minister. Bandaranaike's widow, Sirimavo Bandaranaike, became Prime Minister in July 1960. In 1960 Sir Claude Corea reflected on the irony behind Secretary of State Christian Archibald Herter's remark that it was \\"wholly possible\\" for Red China to be invited to disarmament discussions, asking wryly whether \\"if they are not considered good enough to take their place in the U.N., would they be good enough to sit around the disarmament table?\\" Sir Claude seems to have caught the attention of the Republican National Committee: Documents pertaining to him are to be found in Box 628 of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Library under the rubric \\"Corea, Claude (Sir) ‚Äì Ceylon ‚Äì Chairman U. N. 1st Political Committee.\\" =President of the UN Security Council= Sir Claude Corea created history by becoming the first ever President of the United Nations Security Council from Ceylon in 1960. Sir Claude became President of the UN Security Council in May 1960.Presidents (1960‚Äì1969) : Security Council (SC) : United Nations (UN) On the first day of his presidency Francis Gary Power's Lockheed U-2 plane was forced down onto Soviet territory and he was captured. John F. Kennedy who was a Senator in 1960 visited Sir Claude Corea in his apartment in New York City, during the US presidential raelectionce. Senator Kennedy consulted Sir Claude Corea, who was President of the United Nations Security Council at the time. The presidential race was under way at this time and the Democratic contender, Senator John F. Kennedy, visited Sir Claude in his apartment, for consultation. On 25 May 1960, closing a politically stormy month, Sir Claude told the Security Council: \\"We hold that, at the present time, it is a rule of international law that the air space over the territory of any country belongs to that country and cannot be violated without a breach of international law....\\" The International Civil Aviation Organization negotiated an international agreement which was signed in Chicago in 1944. The signatories, who were sovereign states, big and small, accepted in that agreement the principle of the sovereign right of each state to the air space over its territory. Among the big states which subscribed to this principle is the United States...\\" He pointed out that \\" ... secretly, there have been violations of this principle for the purpose of espionage\\" and that espionage has ‚Äú‚Ä¶ existed for centuries and will continue as long as human frailties continue, and will last as long as states suspect each other, fear each other and seek to dominate each other. But espionage is carried out in darkness, shunning publicity as if it were ashamed of its ugliness. We suppose it is considered necessary in the so-called civilized society of today, although the act itself is demoralizing and degrading.\\" Death The John F. Kennedy Library records that \\"Sir Claude Corea, former Ceylonese diplomat, died\\" on 2 September 1962 in Germany. Lady Corea survived Sir Claude by over 35 years, living a simple life in Colombo, wearing only simple white cotton saris after she had been widowed. There is a photographic portrait of Lady Corea (by Elliot & Fry 1954) in the National Portrait Gallery in Washington D.C. under the name \\"Carmaine Chitty Corea, wife of Sir G. C. S. Corea\\" along with one of Sir George Claude Corea. Sir Claude and Lady Corea had three children: Nihal, Harindra and Chandra. The late Hon. Harindra Corea was a Minister of Telecommunications in the Government of President Ranasinghe Premadasa. He was appointed Deputy Foreign Minister by President Chandrika Kumaratunga in 2000. There are two photographic portraits in the National Portrait Gallery (United States) in Washington, D.C. of 'Sir (George) Claude Stanley Corea (1894‚Äì1962), Ambassador of Ceylon in the USA' and 'Carmaine Chitty Corea, wife of Sir G.

It has a statue of the young Queen Victoria. It separated by the main wing of the Goring Hotel from an almost identical-size space between buildings, as private gardens for the hotel, backed by one road, instead of its four private close-style roads with parking and sets of pavements. Most of the Victoria and Belgravia area is the Duke of Westminster's Grosvenor Estate as to minor, overarching legal interests, the more valuable freehold of let shops and as to open spaces; this square is such an instance, which has a lasting influence on local planning policy and which has had some loss of interest by outright sales, some of which facilitated by the laws of leasehold reform. Architecture and history Fronting the square are 26 houses, which are all Grade II* listed which is the second tier (and so second-rarest) of the pyramidal-hierarchy protection and recognition system. These are five-storey stucco-fronted properties designed by architect Sir Matthew Wyatt (1805‚Äì1886), a member of the Wyatt family -- son of sculptor Matthew Cotes Wyatt and the grandson of James Wyatt; seeing them built in 1838‚Äì40 to celebrate the beginning of Queen Victoria's reign. Most of the houses fronting are now held as freeholds, the residual interest in their leases (reversions) having been bought from the Grosvenor Estate. Protection of planning law of character in this zone has been strengthened to preserve the appearance of Belgravia.

Radiation-based methods used long exposure times which meant that dynamic measurements of the real-time behaviour of process systems were not feasible.

He fought as a Partisan in the NOF, and also participated in the Greek Civil War. After 1949 he fled from Macedonia, Greece to SR Macedonia in Yugoslavia and worked on scientific research in the Archives of Macedonia and the Institute for National History in Skopje. Early life and Partisan activity Kirjazovski was born on 6 January 1927 in the Kastorian village Grache (Ftelia), Greece. He finished his primary education in his native village, just before the beginning of the Second World War. Before his 16th birthday, Kirjazovski became a participant in the national liberation war of Greece. In February 1943 as a voluntary he entered the ranks of ELAS (Greek National Liberation Army), and after the Varkiza agreement for the disarming of ELAS, he enrolled in the ethnic Macedonian organization NOF (National Liberation Front of the Aegean Macedonians). He took part in the first armed battles between NOF and right- wing Greek militias, and after 1946, when the NOF united with the DSE (Democratic Army of Greece), he became a fighter in the DSE and took part in important battles in the Greek Civil War. Because he was the only literate soldier in his detachment, the commanders gave him important roles in writing reports and command - an attribute that gave him access to first hand information which he would later use in his publications. Kirjazovski was wounded twice during military operations on the mountain Vitsi, when fighters of the DSE (composed of 60% ethnic Macedonians) were conducting heavy battles regularly. He was a partisan from 1943 until September 1949, when the DSE was defeated and retreated to Albania. Scientific and publicist work After the defeat of the Democratic Army, Kirjazovski left for the Socialist Republic of Macedonia, where in 1958 he achieved a university degree. For several years he worked as a teacher in Skopje and Resen, and from 1962-1974 he was an employee in the Archives of Macedonia. After that he worked in the Institute of National History as a higher scientific cooperator. In 1978 he was elected the rank scientific councilor. In 1982 he obtained his academic degree Doctor of Sciences. The research of Dr. Kirjazovski was focused mainly on the recent history of Aegean Macedonia (1912‚Äì1949), but he also had publications referencing happenings from the end of the 19th century. Dr. Kirjazovski published over 150 articles in scientific magazines, digest, and newspapers; made revisions of several books; of valuable importance is his role in the collection and ordering of the archive documentation on the Greek Civil War; and also speeches, presentations, symposia, etc. Of great interest are his articles, which are entirely written on the basis of, until then, unknown rich archive documentation which can be found today in the Archives of Macedonia (in both Greek and Macedonian languages). The field of research in his articles and scientific works was: the policy of the Communist party of Greece towards the Macedonian Question, participation of the ethnic Macedonians in the DSE, the aims of the ethnic Macedonians from Greece for the usage of the Macedonian language in schools, the aims and actions of the NOF and others. Capital works The works of Dr. Risto Kirjazovski are of enormous importance for the history of the ethnic Macedonian people, more precisely about the history of Aegean Macedonia.

(Tedford & Wang) Armbruster's wolf (Canis armbrusteri) is an extinct species that was endemic to North America and lived during the Irvingtonian stage of the Pleistocene epoch, spanning from 1.9 Mya‚Äî250,000 years BP.The _Blancan, Irvingtonian and Rancholabrean Mammal Ages by Christopher J. Bell and Ernest L. Lundelius Jr., Anthony D. Barnosky, Russell W. Graham, Everett H. Lindsay, Dennis R. Ruez Jr., Holmes A. Semken Jr., S. David Webb, and Richard J. Zakrzewski. January 2004 in the book: Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic Mammals of North America: Biostratigraphy and Geochronology. Chapter: 7. Publisher: Columbia University Press; Editors: Michael O. Woodburne. pp274-276 It is notable because it is proposed as the ancestor of one of the most famous prehistoric carnivores in North America, the dire wolf (Canis dirus), which replaced it. Taxonomy Canis armbrusteri was named by James W. Gidley in 1913. The first fossils were uncovered at Cumberland Bone Cave, Maryland, in an Irvingtonian terrestrial horizon. Fossil distribution is widespread throughout the United States.PaleoBiology Database: ''Canis armbrusteri,'' fossil map. Paleodb.org. Retrieved on 2012-12-31. Middle Pleistocene in North America. The North American wolves became larger, with tooth specimens indicating that C. priscolatrans diverged into the large wolf C. armbrusteri. R. A. Martin disagreed, and believed that C. armbrusteri was C. lupus. Ronald M. Nowak disagreed with Martin and proposed that C. armbrusteri was not related to C. lupus but C. priscolatrans, which then gave rise to C. dirus. Richard H. Tedford proposed that the South American C. gezi and C. nehringi share dental and cranial similarities developed for hypercarnivory, suggesting C. armbrusteri was the common ancestor of C. gezi, C. nehringi and C. dirus. Based on morphology from China, the Pliocene wolf C. chihliensis may have been the ancestor for both C. armbrusteri and C. lupus before their migration into North America. C. armbrusteri appeared in North America in the Middle Pleistocene and is a wolf-like form larger than any Canis at that time. The three noted paleontologists X. Wang, R. H. Tedford and R. M. Nowak have all proposed that C. dirus had evolved from C. armbrusteri, with Nowak stating that there were specimens from Cumberland Cave, Maryland that indicated C. armbrusteri diverging into C. dirus. The two taxa share a number of characteristics (synapomorphy), which suggests an origin of dirus in the late Irvingtonian in the open terrain in the midcontinent, and then later expanding eastward and displacing armbrusteri.

History When Blab Happy split up, singer/guitarist Mick McCarthy and bassist Tony Owen recruited John Waddington to form Perfume, initially releasing records on their own \\"Aromasound\\" label. Beginning with scented limited edition vinyl, they enjoyed a string of Indie Top 10 hits. Their first release was \\"Yoga/Perfume‚Äù in December 1993, the white label was played repeatedly on Radio 1 by Steve Lamacq and Jo Whiley who still champion the band to this day. Second single \\"Young/Annointed‚Äù (which was also perfume- scented)Strong, Martin C.: \\"The Great Alternative & Indie Discography\\", 1999, Canongate, appeared in April 1994. Third single \\"Lover\\" was picked up on by BBC Radio One DJ's Steve Lamacq and Jo Whiley (the latter getting the band in to record a session for her show). The next two singles stormed the Indie Top 10, Lover (Steve Lamacq‚Äôs Single of the Week) and Yesterday Follows You established the band as radio favourites and NME and Melody Maker did full features on the band including What‚Äôs going On the NME stereo Top 10. The video for Yesterday Follows You was featured on ITV Chart Show and the next headline tour saw shows sell out all over the UK. Perfume recorded songs at BBC Maida Vale for a week long Session for Steve Lamacq and Jo Whiley. Perfume drew a crowd of over 5,000 at the second stage at the Phoenix Festival, quite a statement for a band on their own DIY label self releasing scented limited edition vinyl. They co-headlined with the likes of Travis and toured heavily as a headline act selling out many renowned venues in the UK and were invited to play abroad at prestigious events such as the legendary Black Sessions in Paris. The recruitment of bass player Karl Traae of Leicester's HBM and recently returned from a stint in the US with San Diego's Whirl lead to another Indie Top 10 (UK Chart Top 75) hit in January 1996 with the single \\"Haven't Seen You\\" which was on heavy rotation on daytime radio. That year's success saw them sign to Big Star Records, and to Paul Weller's publishers Notting Hill, who reissued \\"Lover\\" to be followed by the debut album One in 1997 which received glowing reviews in Q and Select magazines. Perfume performed on the NME stage at the Glastonbury Festival in 1997. After a lengthy record company takeover the band‚Äôs final release was a posthumous \\"best of\\" compilation Yesterday Rising released on Aromasound in 1998. Perfume were Paul Weller's special guests at his Lazy Sunday Afternoon in Finsbury Park. Jo Whiley joined the band on stage at BBC Camden Live Festival to add handclaps to Lover, a song she described as \\"The sweetest song in all the world.\\" Steve Lamacq and Jo Whiley included the interview with Perfume when the band surprised Jo for her birthday as one of their highlights in the 20 Years of The Evening Session programs in 2014. Perfume prompted more fanmail than any other band according to Steve Lamacq. The coverage on the Evening Session over a number of years helped the band to secure a string of Top Ten Indie Hits, and are featured on the Top 20 Indie Compilation Albums. NME reported that Michael Stipe and Thom Yorke were spotted at Perfume‚Äôs 100 Club show. Lover was featured on the 2010 Common People Indie Compilation and was described by Luke Lewis of the NME as a \\"lost gem.\\" On NME.com he wrote an article called Rescue A Lost Classic about the song. \\"There is one track on the album that stopped me dead in my tracks.

It is closely related to the amethyst- throated sunangel, and species limits in this complex are unclear.. A proposal to continue to consider this species part of H. amethysticollis pending further study, with unanimous agreement from six other ornithologists. The American Ornithological Society has not recognized the split. Distribution and taxonomy In the Handbook of the Birds of the World, Longuemare's sunangel is one of the four subspecies of the amethyst-throated sunangel: Longuemare's sunangel, H. c. clarisse in the Colombian Andes from Norte de Santander to the latitude of Bogot√°; violiceps in the Sierra de Perij√° (only in Zulia in Venezuela); H. c. verdiscutus in southeastern Norte de Santander, Colombia, and southern T√°chira, Venezuela; and M√©rida sunangel, H. c. spencei isolated in M√©rida, Venezuela. The IOC continues to recognize both the M√©rida sunangel and Longuemare's sunangel.. Description This bird is long (not including the bill) and weighs 5.3 grams, on average. The bill is short for a hummingbird‚Äî1.8 cm or 0.7 in long. The overall impression is of dark plumage. Males are dark green above except that the crown is dull green. They have a narrow, glittering blue \\"frontlet\\" above the bill. Behind the eye is a bold white spot. They have a glittering pinkish-purple throat above a white crescent crossing the chest. The rest of the breast and belly is shining dark green mixed with gray. The undertail coverts are white. The tail is long and broad, bronze-green to blackish, with tiny white tips on the two outer feathers. Females resemble males but are duller, and white feather bases may show in the throat. Habitat It inhabits forests, especially edges and openings, as well as brushy pastures and damp ravines with bushes; Behavior Longuemare's sunangel generally flies and perches fairly low. Along forest edges with rich patches of flowers such as Psammisia and similar plants of the heath family, it behaves territorially. However, within forests, it flies along \\"trap-lines\\" from one flowering vine, epiphyte, or shrub (such as Palicourea) to the next. It feeds on nectar by hovering in front of flowers or clinging. In addition, it occasionally catches airborne insects in short flights. It feeds actively in the midst of mixed-species flocks when they pass.

From 1807 to 1813, she claimed to have eaten nothing at all, but her claims were eventually shown to be a hoax. Life Ann was born in Rosliston,One source \\"The Cabinet of Curiosities: Or, Wonders of the World Displayed\\" says she was born at Royston near Ashbourne. Derbyshire, the daughter of a day-labourer named Peg or Pegg. In 1788 she inveigled into marriage a farm servant, James Moore, who soon deserted her. She then lived on her looks and became the mother of a large family. About 1800 she made her way to Tutbury to find employment. Reduced to dire poverty, she subsisted on the minimum amount of food necessary to support a human being, and the astonishment created locally by her long fasts doubtless encouraged her to undertake the imposture which made her notorious. It was given out that she had lost all desire for food from November 1806. Six months later the interest taken in her in the neighbourhood was sufficient to warrant her in taking permanently to her bed. On 20 May 1807 it was reported that she attempted to swallow a piece of biscuit, but the effort was followed by great pain and vomiting of blood. 'The last food she ever took was a few blackcurrants, on 17 July 1807,' and in August 'she gradually diminished her liquids.' Details were multiplied in the pamphlets which narrated her case. One learned writer proved that she lived on air, another that the phenomenon was due to disease of the oesophagus, while a third was convinced that her condition was a manifestation of the supernatural power of God. Joanna Southcott declared that the advent of the fasting-woman presaged a three years' famine in France. An investigation was set on foot in September 1808, and a succession of four hours' watches, undertaken by the chief inhabitants of the district, A Statement of Facts, Relative to the Supposed Abstinence of Ann Moore By Legh Richmond Accessed 2007-10-05. was arranged to cover a period of sixteen days. Bulletins were posted from time to time in Tutbury, to record progress, and a list of the watchers was published. At the commencement of the ordeal Mrs. Moore was described as terribly worn and emaciated, but as it progressed she sensibly improved in health and spirits. Robert Taylor and John Allen, two local doctors made communications on the subject of the case to the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal in November and December 1808. The report of the committee was generally held to be conclusive evidence of Ann's veracity. For the next four years she continued to attract crowds of visitors many making a substantial offering. My own story; or, The autobiography of a child by Mary Howitt p131 Mary Howitt, then Mary Botham, was taken to see her as a child as she explains in her autobiography. She says that her father told her that not many believed that she ate nothing but that she did eat very little. Mary said that she could only think of the following poem: There was an old lady all skin and bone This old lady was very well known She lay in bed as I've heard say For many years to fast and pray When she had lain a twelvemonth's space The flesh was gone from hands and face When that another twelvemonth was gone She was nothing at all but a skeleton In 1812 she deposited ¬£400 in the funds, but in the summer of that year Alexander Henderson (1780‚Äì1863) Physician to the Westminster General Dispensary, wrote an able Examination ' of the imposture,Alexander Henderson in Journal of Foreign Medical Science and Literature edited by Samuel Emlen, accessed October 2007 showing the inconsistencies and absurdities of the woman's statements, and the curious parallel between the case and that of Anna M. Kinker, a girl of Osnabr√ºck, who practised a similar imposture in Germany in 1800. Henderson reported that Ann claimed to have not eaten solid food for \\"upwards of five years\\" and had not drunk liquid for four years. She claimed that she did not pass urine or any other matter. Having survived one watch, Ann was subjected to another by the writer and clergyman Legh Richmond to check her claims. It commenced on 21 April 1813, and continued till the 30th, when her daughter asked for it to stop. She was shown to be a cheat. She died a few months afterwards, aged 53 years.Whites 1857 Directory of Derbyshire Secret methods The first set of doctors who investigated Moore were easily duped. According to skeptical writer Bergen Evans: > The credulousness of the first set of watchers was revealed in her admission > that during the whole sixteen days of her first observation she had been fed > by her daughter while the watchers were in the room.

Wiston House today Family Thomas Shirley was the eldest of the three children of William Sherley (c.1498‚Äì1551) of Wiston, Sussex, and Mary Isley, the daughter of Thomas Isley of Sundridge, Kent. Career He was knighted in 1573, and served as High Sheriff of Surrey and Sussex in 1576. Also in 1573, he began rebuilding the family seat of Wiston House, which he turned into a massive country house. (It is now the site of the government's Wilton Park conference centre.) However, soon afterwards Shirley found himself in considerable financial difficulties which eventually swallowed the family fortune. In 1586 Queen Elizabeth I appointed Sir Thomas Treasurer-at-War to the English forces serving in the Netherlands during the Dutch Revolt. This gave him the power to speculate with the funds that passed through his hands (a normal perk of office at this period), but he so mishandled them that he contracted massive debts to the Crown and found himself accused of fraud. His estate, including Wiston House, was sequestered in 1602, though he continued to live at Wiston until his death in October 1612. Sir Thomas was elected to Parliament as MP for Sussex in 1584, representing the county for many years, and then Steyning, in 1601 and 1604, which was controlled by Shirley as a pocket borough; he was apparently not distinguished as a member, but tried to draw upon an MP's privilege of immunity from arrest in 1604 when his debts grew too pressing to meet. Despite his protests that he had parliamentary privilege, he was arrested at the instigation of a goldsmith to whom he owed money, and placed in the Fleet Prison. The House of Commons of England made a number of attempts to order his release by issuing writs of Habeas Corpus, but the Warden of the Fleet Prison would not free him, unless he received assurance that he would not himself be held liable for Shirley's debts, or blamed for what might technically be seen as allowing an 'escape'. The Commons had the Warden placed in the Tower of London and sent the sergeant-at-arms of the Commons, who was carrying the mace, to the Fleet Prison to set Shirley free. However, the Warden's wife proved equally obdurate, and the sergeant-at-arms had to report that his mission had been a failure. The Warden had originally been able to move around within the Tower, but now the Commons made sure that he was placed in an unpleasant dungeon, called the Little Ease, four feet (1.2 metres) square, within the Tower. This persuaded the Warden to release Shirley, and he also had to apologise on his knees to the House of Commons. Shirley then resumed his seat as an MP. Parliament subsequently passed a general act (The Privilege of Parliament Act), which confirmed the privilege of freedom from arrest for Members, but also gave creditors an opportunity to recover what they were owed when the debtor ceased being an MP. This case is generally regarded as having finally settled the question of privilege from arrest in the Commons‚Äô favour, and was cited as Sir Thomas Shirley's Case for centuries afterwards. His sons Thomas, Anthony and Robert were all noted adventurers. Marriage and issue Shirley married, about 1559, Anne Kempe (c.1542‚Äì1623), the daughter of Sir Thomas Kempe (d.1591) of Wye, Kent, by whom he had twelve children, of whom three died as infants. Shirley was survived by three sons and six daughters: *Sir Thomas Shirley (1564‚Äì1633/4), who married firstly Frances Vavasour, by whom he had three sons, including the playwright, Henry Shirley, and four daughters, and secondly Judith Bennett, the daughter of William Bennett of London, and the widow of a husband surnamed Taylor, by whom he had five sons and six daughters. *Sir Anthony Shirley (1565‚Äì1636?), who married Frances Vernon (baptised 1573), the daughter of Sir John Vernon of Hodnet, Shropshire. *Robert Shirley (c. 1581 ‚Äì 1628), who married Sampsonia (c. 1590 ‚Äì 1668), the daughter of Isma‚Äòil Khan, by whom he had an only son, Henry Shirley. *Cecily (or Margaret?)

Henriette de France. Marie Ad√©la√Øde de France. Victoire de France. Sophie de France. Mesdames (, My Ladies) is a form of address for several adult females. In the 18th century, Mesdames de France was used to designate the daughters of Louis XV of France, most of whom lived at the royal court and never married. Filles de France Unlike other unmarried daughters of the nobility who were born demoiselles, the princesses who were the daughters of the kings of France were born with the rank and title of \\"dame.\\" A Daughter of France (fille de France) was thus addressed as Madame, followed by her first name or her title if she had one. The treatment was the same with the sole exception that with the eldest, it was not necessary to add the first name, and the simple appellation \\"Madame\\" sufficed to designate her. The sister-in-law of the king was similarly treated. When one existed (this was the case for Louis XIV of France and Louis XVI of France but not for Louis XV, who was the sole surviving sibling), the first of the filles de France was given the title of \\"Madame Royale.\\" A particular group The appellation of \\"Mesdames\\" remained in history because of particular genealogical, political, and strategic circumstances that caused many of the eight daughters that Louis XV had with Marie Leszczynska to remain at the French court, including: *Marie Louise √âlisabeth of France (1727 - 1759), Madame *Henriette Anne de France (1727 - 1752), her twin, entitled Madame Seconde, then Madame after the marriage of her twin sister *Marie Louise de France (1728 - 1733), Madame Troisi√®me, then Madame Louise *Marie Ad√©la√Øde de France (1732 - 1800), Madame Quatri√®me, then Madame Troisi√®me, then Madame Ad√©la√Øde and finally Madame, after the death of Madame Henriette *Marie Louise Th√©r√®se Victoire de France (1733 - 1799), Madame Quatri√®me, then Madame Victoire *Sophie Philippine √âlisabeth Justine de France (1734 - 1782), Madame Cinqui√®me then Madame Sophie *Marie Th√©r√®se F√©licit√© de France (1736 - 1744), Madame Sixi√®me, then Madame Th√©r√®se *Louise Marie de France (1737 - 1787), Madame Septi√®me or Derni√®re, then Madame Louise =At Versailles= To economise on their maintenance at court, and to prevent the queen (to whom a large, allied brood would give comfort) from having too much influence, the last four of the princesses were raised far from the court, at Poitou in the Fontevraud Abbey from 1738 to 1750, where they passed their formative years before returning to Versailles. Madame Th√©r√®se did not return to Versailles, and Madame Louise came back, but was very strongly influenced by the monastic life, to which she later returned at Carmel de Saint-Denis. The king kept the eldest one at his side; he was attached to her and separation made him very sad. Madame Ad√©la√Øde owed her maintenance at Versailles to her wishes and her successful request to remain near the king, whom she knew how to influence. Mesdames, together with the Dauphin, sustained a long battle against the successive mistresses of their father, particularly Madame de Pompadour, who they called amongst themselves \\"Maman putain\\" (Mama Whore). Their support of the cause of the devout was permanent, and the reason, for their entire tenure at court, for their difficult relation with the king, who only consented very late to let them occupy apartments on the ground floor of the main building at Versailles, the apartments which today bear their name. Among them, Madame Ad√©la√Øde was the one that exercised the most political role at the court, managing her sisters after the death of Madame Henriette in 1752, and intriguing unceasingly in favor of her brother and for the reestablishment of moral order at court. Upon the accession to the throne of her nephew, she cherished the hope of exercising an influence over him but was soon forced to realize that he would not give her the role she wished. Pushed away from power bit by bit, and representing the old court against the new generation, she increasingly retired with her sisters to the Ch√¢teau de Bellevue, which had been constructed for Madame de Pompadour. They finally obtained it and passed most of the last decade of the ancien r√©gime there. After the days of October 1789, Ad√©la√Øde and Victoire retired to Bellevue, from whence they fled, ending up, after much wandering, in Italy, where they spent the remainder of their days.

Influences Luca Cardelli and Mart√≠n Abadi wrote the book A Theory of Objects in 1997 laying out formal calculi for the semantics of object-oriented programming languages. Baby Modula-3 influenced this work according to Luca Cardelli, and guided a calculus of the type of self in Types for object and the type of 'self'. It has opened the way for work on Modula-3 formal semantic checking systems, for object oriented type system programming languages that have been used to model the formal semantics of programming languages such as Ada (programming language) and C (programming language) .

Barnstorming teams differ from traveling teams in that they operate outside the framework of an established athletic league, while traveling teams are designated by a league, formally or informally, to be a designated visiting team. Barnstorming allowed athletes to compete in two sports; for example, Goose Reece Tatum played basketball for the Harlem Globetrotters and baseball for a Negro Leagues barnstorming team. Some barnstorming teams lack home arenas, while others go on \\"barnstorming tours\\" in the off-season. History Teams in baseball's Negro Leagues often barnstormed before, during, and after their league's regular season. Hall of Fame baseball pitcher Satchel Paige barnstorm toured with Dempsey Hovland's Caribbean Kings. Hovland founded (and owned) several barnstorming teams, including the Texas Cowgirls (1949‚Äì1977), the first integrated professional women's basketball team to tour worldwide, and the New York Harlem Queens. The Harlem Globetrotters and Texas Cowgirls shared training camps, seasons, and circuits. While barnstorming is no longer as popular as it was in the 20th century, some teams such as basketball's Harlem Globetrotters, softball's King and His Court founded by Eddie Feigner and ice hockey's Buffalo Sabres Alumni Hockey Team carry on the tradition. In the 1990s the Colorado Silver Bullets women's baseball team resurrected barnstorming because there was no women's league. It was very common in the early days of professional American football; for instance, the Los Angeles Wildcats of the first American Football League (AFL) of 1926 played the regular season as a traveling team, then went on a post-season barnstorming tour of Texas and California, with Red Grange and the New York Yankees as the designated opponent for most of these games. NFL teams were also known to barnstorm in small towns against local teams all the way up through World War II. Several auto racers, most notably Barney Oldfield, staged exhibitions around the United States in the early twentieth century. In 1914 he barnstormed against the aviator Lincoln Beachey at least 35 times. In rugby union, the Barbarians, an invitation-only team, are famous for having no ground or clubhouse.\\"History of the Barbarians\\", Barbarian F.C. official website Teams ;American Football * Los Angeles Wildcats * Tampa Cardinals ;Baseball * Caribbean Kings * House of David, a baseball team that toured rural America from the 1920s until the 1950s * Indianapolis Clowns ;Basketball *Harlem Globetrotters *Texas Cowgirls *Washington Generals ;Cricket *Bunbury Cricket Club *Kaipaki Nation Cricket Club\\"Kaipaki Nation Cricket Club\\" ;Ice hockey *Buffalo Sabres Alumni Hockey Team *montreal canadiens legends ;Rugby Union *Barbarian F.C. ;Softball *King and His Court =Other= The Lancaster Barnstormers are a professional baseball team based in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.
