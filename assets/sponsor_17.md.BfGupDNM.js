Despite its name, the station is in the neighbouring civil parish of Chawleigh. It is a passing place on the single track Tarka Line north west of Exeter on the way to . History The station was opened by the North Devon Railway on 1 August 1854. The North Devon Railway was required to obtain permission from the landowner, the Earl of Portsmouth, whose country seat was situated within an estate near to the site of the station. It is said that the Earl agreed to the railway being built on his land on the understanding that all trains would stop at the station thus affording easy access to Eggesford House for visiting guests. To this day, all trains continue to stop although the Earl's family have long become extinct. This is possibly more as a result of the station being an exchange point for tokens on the Crediton to Eggesford and Eggesford to Barnstaple Token Block sections. In BR steam days the summer Saturday Atlantic Coast Express, the thirteen coach 11.00 Waterloo to Ilfracombe, made its only stop between Exeter and Barnstaple at Eggesford. A signalbox was in existence at Eggesford until 1987, however the line has since been rationalised and the passing loop automated with the use of spring points. Token exchange is now carried out by the driver in an unmanned hut located on each platform. The conductor/guard is also required to activate the controls of the level crossing at the station. Token release and train signalling is carried out by Crediton signalbox. In the late 1960s, the down platform and buildings were washed away by the flooded River Taw, following torrential rain. However, a replacement structure was built. Services A train to Exmouth All trains on the to service stop at Eggesford. Trains connect with main line services at . There is an hourly service each way for most of the day (Mon-Sat), with most north and south-bound trains scheduled to pass each other here.

It was the original ferme ornée (\\"decorative farm\\"), a term invented by Stephen Switzer in 1741gardenvisi Life Philip Southcote, a young army captain, was the fourth son of Sir Edward Southcote. Southcote had a long affair with the notorious courtesan Teresia Constantia Phillips which started in 1727.John Martin, ‘Southcote, Philip (1697/8–1758)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 25 March 2015 Southcote bought the small property called Woburn Farm in 1735. He married the wealthy Duchess of Cleveland. They wanted a country home and Woburn Farm had 150 acres, 35 acres of which Philip used to create a beautiful garden; the rest was used as a farm. The gardens were contained within a weaving ornamental walk, remains of which can be seen between the Philip Southcote school for children with special needs and Gerry Cottle's Circus headquarters.Philip Southcote School about the grounds shared with St George's College Woburn Farm's grotto and architectural garden follies, arches and gateways, some features designed by William Kent, including the existing rusticated entrance that marks the entrance from the public road, soon attracted stylish visitors who made the serpentine circuit of the garden, passing from feature to feature: \\"all my design at first was to have a garden on the middle high ground and a walk all round my farm, for convenience as well as pleasure\\" Southcote wrote . A feature of Woburn Farm was a walk planted with broom, roses, lilac, columbine, peonies and sweet william, which wound its way through the fields, for it remained a working farm . Like William Shenstone's Arcadian garden, the Leasowes, Woburn Farm was highly influential in disseminating the landscape garden; it received an extended description in Thomas Whateley's Observations on modern gardening. In a letter in 1751, Horace Walpole wrote rather peevishly of Capability Brown's landscaping at Warwick Castle, \\"The castle is enchanting; the view pleased me more than I can express, the river Avon tumbles down a cascade at the foot of it. It is well laid out by one Brown who has set up on a few ideas of Kent and Mr. Southcote.\\" Later in life, summing up his thoughts in his Essay On Modern Gardening, Walpole divided types of gardens in the \\"modern\\" naturalistic style into three: \\"into the garden that connects itself with a park, into the ornamented farm, and into the forest or savage garden\\". To Southcote, Walpole gives the credit for the idealized farm. . Southcote was a friend of leading writers and gardeners of his day, including Pope, Lord Burlington, Lord Petre, and William Kent.

Looney Tunes short directed by Friz Freleng. The cartoon was released on April 22, 1950, and stars Bugs Bunny.  Plot  Needing to get away from hunters, Bugs digs a tunnel and accidentally winds up in Sing Song Prison (a clear reference to Sing Sing Prison; \\"No Hanging Around\\"). As he tries settling himself to his hiding spot, prison guard Yosemite Sam (here called Sam Schultz) beats Bugs with a billy club, telling him, \\"Trying to pull an escape, 777174, huh?\\" to which Bugs replies, \\"I'm not 777174 - I'm only 3½.\\" Sam believes that, but he does not believe that Bugs is not a prisoner. Thus, Bugs is arrested, attired accordingly, numbered 3½, and sent to the rock pile (\\"Neh, my mother told me there'd be days like this.\\") When Sam smugly tells Bugs that he will be locked up in jail for 50 years (though it is not specified why, the crimes committed in Rebel Rabbit, or whatever offense got the unseen #777174 incarcerated are two possible reasons), Bugs quickly comes up with an escape plan. He screams that a prisoner is escaping and points into the distance, allowing himself time to insert his chain ball into a cannon when Sam is not looking. A few seconds later, Sam fires the cannon to shoot down the \\"escaping prisoner\\", sending Bugs over the wall to freedom. However, it does not take long for Sam to get wise; he drives a police car out of the prison and recaptures Bugs. For his attempted escape, Sam punishes Bugs by ordering him to be confined in his jail cell. When Sam locks Bugs inside, Bugs pulls a switch so that Sam is tricked into locking himself in the cell and freeing Bugs. Sam breaks out and holds Bugs at gunpoint, threatening Bugs with solitary confinement for 99 years. Bugs quickly pulls another switcheroo by telling Sam that a really tough person would not use his uniform to intimidate another (\\"Eh, you wouldn't be so tough if you weren't wearing that uniform!\\") and challenges him to a \\"fight\\". Accepting the challenge, Sam takes his uniform off and levels his fists at Bugs, who has taken off his prison outfit. Bugs quickly admits to Sam that he IS tough without his uniform and they redress, with Bugs putting on the police uniform and Sam absentmindedly putting on the prison outfit, after which Bugs blows a whistle and Sam, realizing too late that he has been tricked again, is beaten up by several correction officers for \\"trying to escape\\" and thrown into a jail cell. Inside his cell, Sam throws a tantrum and demands a \\"habus corpeas\\". Bugs, who is having too much fun with outsmarting Sam to leave, pretends to be a sympathetic guard and gives Sam a loaf of bread, which is an \\"Ajax Escape Kit\\" containing a shovel, pickaxe, jackhammer, and map (\\"I'm getting ya out of here, see? I haven't forgotten what you've done for Mary an' the kids, see?\\"). Sam starts digging and comes up in what appears to be a jungle but is really many oversized plants... in the warden's office. The warden scolds Sam for fooling around, gives him a new officer's uniform and dismisses him from his office. Resuming his pursuit of Bugs, Sam chases him up a ladder to the gallows. As Bugs escapes through the trap door, Sam falls in and accidentally hangs himself (but does not die due to cartoon logic). As Sam angrily rants at this latest failure, he is called upon by the warden, who is Bugs in disguise. The faux warden tricks Sam into sitting on an electric chair, but then Bugs' fake mustache slips off, exposing the ruse. Sam chases Bugs out of the warden's office, around the prison and seemingly right back into the office, where he whacks whom he thinks is Bugs over the head with a billy club, only to find that he has clubbed the REAL warden, who warns Sam that he will be fired if he makes one more mistake. Having had his fill of Bugs, Sam stops Bugs at gunpoint, opens the prison gate and orders Bugs to leave the grounds. Bugs walks out and Sam celebrates, but the warden (\\"SCHULTZ! OFFICE!\\"), outraged by his actions, arrests and imprisons him for allowing a prisoner to escape (which is a false conviction, since Bugs was never a prisoner to begin with). Sam, now in prison garb for real, groans about his predicament at the rock pile and asks \\"I'd like to know what dirty stool pigeon squealed on me\\". Nearby, a grinning Bugs (implying that he was the one who ratted out Sam) acts like a pigeon while standing on a stool.

The main offices are located in the unincorporated village of Penfield in Huston Township, Clearfield County, Pennsylvania in the United States. The forest is located chiefly in Centre, Clearfield, and Elk Counties, with small parts of the forest also in Cameron and Clinton Counties. History Moshannon State Forest was formed as a direct result of the depletion of the forests of Pennsylvania that took place during the mid-to- late 19th century. Conservationists like Dr. Joseph Rothrock became concerned that the forests would not regrow if they were not managed properly. Lumber and iron companies had harvested the old-growth forests for various reasons. They clear cut the forests, and left behind nothing but dried tree tops and rotting stumps. The sparks of passing steam locomotives ignited wildfires that prevented the formation of second growth forests. The conservationists feared that the forest would never regrow if there was not a change in the philosophy of forest management. They called for the state to purchase land from the lumber and iron companies and the lumber and iron companies were more than willing to sell their land since that had depleted the natural resources of the forests. The changes began to take place in 1895 when Dr. Rothrock was appointed the first commissioner of the Pennsylvania Department of Forests and Waters, the forerunner of today's Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. The Pennsylvania General Assembly passed a piece of legislation in 1897 that authorized the purchase of \\"unseated lands for forest reservations\\". This was the beginning of the State Forest system. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania began purchasing tracts of land for what is now Moshannon State Forest on September 28, 1898. The first purchase was on the banks of Montgomery Run to the north of Clearfield. It was purchased for just $65.45 to settle a delinquent tax payment. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources' web page, the state is still acquiring land that meets the \\"current guidelines\\" to become state forest land. Much of the land that is now Moshannon State Forest has been purchased from lumber and land holding companies. At the time of purchase the land was largely devoid of trees. It was mostly dried brush and burnt scrub. This was a direct result of the clearcutting of the vast stands of old growth forest during the mid-to-late 19th century and very early 20th century. The lumber companies chopped down the hemlock and white pine forests that once covered much of Pennsylvania. According to Conrad Weiser, who wrote in 1737, All of the virgin forest was gone by 1921. It has since been replaced by a thriving second growth forest of beech, yellow poplar, a variety of birch, oak, hickory, cherry, chestnut and maples. On May 31, 1985 a 2.2-mile-wide F4 tornado tore through part of the forest, destroying an estimated 88,000 trees.

The village is a popular stop- off point on the Haute Route, a classic high-altitude mountain trek between Chamonix and Zermatt. The expedition can be tackled either by foot in the summer or by skis in the winter and spring. It is also on the itinerary of the Patrouille des Glaciers. In the winter, Arolla has its own small Alpine ski area which makes up for its lack of scale with reliable snow cover, spectacular scenery and quiet pistes. Hotels in Arolla include the historic Hotel Mont Collon, located near the entrance to the village, and Hotel Kurhaus, situated at the top of the series of hair-pin bends that rise through the village. There is a post office, mountain sports shop, hotel Du Pigne and bus stop in the small village centre. In addition to Mont Collon, the village is also overlooked by Pigne d'Arolla, a 3796-metre mountain, which can be climbed from the Cabane des Vignettes or Dix Hut mountain huts above Arolla. Pra Gra (2479m), an abandoned hamlet above Arolla, can be reached by a moderate walk of approximately 80 mins. The views of Mont Collon and the glacial trench at the end of the valley are particularly striking from this location.

Origin of this surname trace back to when it was spelled Cygweli which means \\"swan.\\" History and description Kidwelly Castle, c. 1810. The present remains of the castle include work from about 1111 to about 1476. Created as a defence against the Welsh, the castle fell to the Welsh several times in the twelfth century. Later in its history, it was unsuccessfully besieged by forces of Owain Glyndŵr in 1403 with assistance from soldiers from France and Brittany who captured Kidwelly town. The castle was relieved by a Norman army after just three weeks. The gatehouse was extensively damaged and it was rebuilt on the instructions of King Henry V. It largely escaped involvement in the English Civil War. The plan of the castle consists of a square inner bailey defended by four round towers, which overlook a semi-circular outer curtain wall on the landward side, with the massive gatehouse next to the river. The river prevents this from being a truly concentric plan, however a jutting tower protects the riverside walls, and the final plan is very strong. Plan of Kidwelly Castle The castle is relatively well-preserved, and is managed by Cadw. The surrounding countryside is reputedly haunted by the headless ghost of Gwenllian ferch Gruffydd, wife of the Welsh prince Gruffydd ap Rhys, who was beheaded in 1136. In film Kidwelly was used as a location for the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail, appearing in the very first scene after the titles. After the first view of King Arthur and Patsy, a very misty establishing shot shows Kidwelly as their destination. However, the following close up filming was done at Doune Castle in Scotland.

Several fans give their verdict on Blur, particularly on how the band have perfected their live act. The band's manager also appears in some scenes, although his face is blanked out. Two German fans seem obsessed with the band and Damon Albarn in particular, having followed the group from New York to England to Germany. Since its original 1993 release, the film has gained a cult following and was re-released on DVD in 2004.

A 14th-century illustration showing an English herald approaching a troop of Scottish soldiers – an incident of the Anglo-Scottish Wars. Tabard worn by a herald in the College of Arms A herald, or a herald of arms, is an officer of arms, ranking between pursuivant and king of arms. The title is commonly applied more broadly to all officers of arms. Heralds were originally messengers sent by monarchs or noblemen to convey messages or proclamations—in this sense being the predecessors of modern diplomats. In the Hundred Years' War, French heralds challenged King Henry V to fight. During the Battle of Agincourt, the English herald and the French herald, Montjoie, watched the battle together from a nearby hill; both agreed that the English were the victors, and Montjoie provided King Henry V, who thus earned the right to name the battle, with the name of the nearby castle.Keegan, John. The Face of Battle, 1983, Penguin Classics, , pp 74, 77, 104–105 Like other officers of arms, a herald would often wear a surcoat, called a tabard, decorated with the coat of arms of his master. It was possibly due to their role in managing the tournaments of the Late Middle Ages that heralds came to be associated with the regulation of the knights' coats of arms. Heralds have been employed by kings and large landowners, principally as messengers and ambassadors. Heralds were required to organise, announce and referee the contestants at a tournament.The Historical Atlas of Knights and Castles, Ian Barnes, 2007 pp.176&177. This practice of heraldry became increasingly important and further regulated over the years, and in several countries around the world it is still overseen by heralds. In the United Kingdom heralds are still called upon at times to read proclamations publicly; for which they still wear tabards emblazoned with the royal coat of arms. There are active official heralds today in several countries, including the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Canada, and the Republic of South Africa. In England and Scotland most heralds are full- time employees of the sovereign and are called \\"Heralds of Arms in Ordinary\\". Temporary appointments can be made of \\"Heralds of Arms Extraordinary\\". These are often appointed for a specific major state occasions, such as a coronation. The Canadian Heraldic Authority has created the position of \\"Herald of Arms Emeritus\\" with which to honor long-serving or distinguished heraldists. In Scotland, some Scottish clan chiefs, the heads of great noble houses, still appoint private officers of arms to handle cases of heraldic or genealogical importance of clan members, although these are usually pursuivants. In addition, many orders of chivalry have heralds attached to them. These heralds may have some heraldic duties but are more often merely ceremonial in nature. Heralds which were primarily ceremonial in nature, especially after the decline of chivalry, were also appointed in various nations for specific events such as a coronation as additions to the pageantry of these occasions. In the Netherlands, heralds are appointed for the Dutch monarch's inauguration where they wore their tabards until 1948; these heralds proclaim the inauguration ceremony to have been completed to those inside and outside the Nieuwe Kerk.

It aims at evaluating ability to think constructively, rather than at simple fluency or vocabulary recognition.  Verbal reasoning intelligence tests  Verbal reasoning tests of intelligence provide an assessment of an individual's ability to think, reason and solve problems in different ways. The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale III (WAIS-III) divides Verbal IQ (VIQ) into two categories: * Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI) – vocabulary, similarities, information, and comprehension. * Working Memory Index (WMI) – arithmetic, digit span, and letter-number sequencing. Verbal reasoning tests are often used as entrance examinations by schools, colleges and universities to select the most able applicants. They are also used by a growing number of employers as part of the selection/recruitment process. Large graduate training schemes are increasingly using verbal reasoning tests (verbals) to distinguish between applicants. The types of verbals candidates face in these assessments are typically looking to assess understanding and comprehension skills.  Types  = Proposition = A basic aspect of verbal reasoning, a proposition is a statement that expresses a judgement, opinion or fact about something. A proposition does not have to be a true statement, but it does have to be a statement that is empirically provable as either true or false using data. A simple statement such as \\"sharks are dangerous\\" is a form of proposition. = Premise = A premise is a proposition that will justify or induce a conclusion. In other words, a premise is an assumption that something is true. For example, a statement such as \\"John has no car and therefore won't be able to go to work today,\\" has two premises which induce the conclusion that John won't be at work. The first premise is that \\"John has no car\\". The second premise is implicit, and can be explicitly stated as \\"John cannot go to work today unless he has a car\\". The logical conclusion following from these two premises, then, is that John won't be able to go to work today. = Syllogism = A syllogism is an argument that consists of premises in order to arrive at a truth. For example, \\"Mary is a woman. All women have hair, therefore Mary has hair\\". The validity of a syllogism also depends on how truthful or factual the premises are. = Verbal analogies = Verbal analogies are comparisons between two subjects or concepts based on their relations (ex. similarities). An example of a verbal analogy is, \\"A car to a garage is like a ship to a shipping dock\\".  Verbal reasoning in recruitment  Verbal reasoning tests are often used during recruitment for positions in many industries, such as banking, finance, management consulting, mining and accounting. The tests are used as an efficient way to short list candidates for later stages of the recruitment process, such as interview. When used in recruitment, the tests normally include a series of text passages regarding a random topic. Then there will be a series of statements regarding the passages. The candidate must then determine if the statement is true, false or they can't tell (it's ambiguous). The candidate is not expected to know anything about the topics, and the answer is to be based purely on the information in the passage.  LSAT  The Law School Admission Test (LSAT) is a classic measure that evaluates the verbal reasoning ability of participants who are applying to a graduate law school. The multiple choice sections are broken up into three parts: * Reading Comprehension – ability to understand complex language material like paragraphs or passages and able to answer questions regarding them. * Analytical reasoning – ability to understand relationships in language material like statements or passages and being able to draw reasonable conclusions from them. * Logical reasoning – Using critical thinking to assess and complete an argument given on the test.

It was initially named Yuri Andropov () for Yuri Andropov, the former General Secretary of the Communist Party, but the ship's name was changed after the fall of the Soviet Union. The Russian designation for the type is \\"heavy nuclear missile cruiser\\", but Western defense commentators have resurrected the term \\"battlecruiser\\" to describe them, as they are the largest surface combatant warships in the world. Pyotr Velikiy is the flagship of the Northern Fleet. Construction of the ship was delayed by lack of funding due to the national economic problems before and after the fall of the Soviet Union. It was not completed and commissioned until 1998, twelve years after work had started. By then it had been renamed Pyotr Velikiy, Russian for Peter the Great. Pyotr Velikiy has been known to carry two pennant numbers during its service: \\"183\\" and currently \\"099\\". Service history After completing its acceptance trials in November 1996, the vessel was transferred to the Northern Fleet at Severomorsk and was designated as the flagship of the Northern Fleet. In August 2000 Pyotr Velikiy was in the Barents Sea to oversee the largest naval training exercise in a decade, since the fall of the Soviet Union. The ship was to be the designated target of the Oscar-II class submarine K-141 Kursk, and was conducting evasive maneuvers when communication with Kursk was lost. The submarine was later found to have suffered catastrophic torpedo detonations, resulting in the loss of all 118 crew members. Pyotr Velikiy guarded the area where the submarine sank during the subsequent salvage operation in 2001. In March 2004, Russian Navy Chief Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov declared Pyotr Velikiy unfit for service due to problems with the ship's engineering maintenance. On 19 April 2004, the cruiser was docked in the floating drydock PD-50 for painting of the underside of the hull, repairs, and examination of the steering system. The repairs were completed later that year, and it was carrying out missions again by August. From September 21 to October 22, 2004 she sailed on her first long voyage. Accompanying the aircraft carrier , the destroyers Admiral Chabanenko and Admiral Ushakov, as well as several auxiliary ships, she went into the north-western Atlantic in what was the largest Russian naval exercise after the end of the Cold war.https://web.archive.org/web/20041107044237/http://www.cdi.org/russia/329-9.cfm:ru:Маршал Устинов (ракетный крейсер) = 2008–2009 = On 8 September 2008, it was announced that Pyotr Velikiy would sail to the Caribbean Sea to participate in naval exercises with the Venezuelan Navy, along with the destroyer and other support ships.

Uses Aniline Yellow is used in microscopy for vital staining,http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag/artfeb00/rhvital.html in pyrotechnics for yellow colored smokes, in yellow pigments and inks including inks for inkjet printers. It is also used in insecticides, lacquers, varnishes, waxes, oil stains, and styrene resins. It is also an intermediate in synthesis of other dyes, e.g. chrysoidine, indulines, Solid Yellow, and Acid Yellow. Toxic oil syndrome Aniline Yellow was involved in the 1981 Spanish Toxic Oil Syndrome (TOS). A Madrid-based company imported denaturated rapeseed oil, dyed by aniline yellow to mark it as unsuitable for human consumption, to be used as a fuel in steel mills. However, the company distilled the oil to remove the dye, and sold it as a much more valuable olive oil for cooking. The result was a rash of pneumonia-type illnesses, with a second stage with lesions, weight loss, paralysis, and muscle wasting. The net result was over 20,000 sick and 400 dead.

Its capital was Neuburg an der Donau. Its area was about 2,750 km², with a population of some 100,000. History The Duchy of Palatinate-Neuburg was created in 1505 as the result of the Landshut War of Succession and existed until 1799 or 1808. After the so-called Kölner Spruch (Verdict of Cologne) the duchy was created from the territories north of the Danube for Otto Henry and Philipp, the sons of Ruprecht of the Palatinate. While they were minors, their grandfather Philip, Elector Palatine, ruled the duchy until his death in 1508, followed by Elector Frederick II. In 1541 elector Otto Henry converted to Lutheranism and his palace chapel at Neuburg Castle was the first newly built Protestant church of all, consecrated on 25 April 1543 by the reformed theologian Andreas Osiander. In 1557 Otto Henry ceded his duchy (the so-called Young Palatinate) to Count Palatine Wolfgang of Zweibrücken. The eldest son of Wolfgang, Philipp Louis, founded in 1569 the elder line of Palatine Zweibrücken-Neuburg, from which the Palatine Sulzbach lineage was separated in 1614. Palatinate-Neuburg joined the Protestant Union in 1608. In 1800, the duchy was invaded by the France and on June 26, 1800, the Habsburg, Württemberg and Bavarian armies fought a battle there. After fighting for most of a day, the Coalition armies withdrew. Neuburg was occupied by the French, and General Ney established his headquarters in the castle there.Marceau, p 105. The Duchy of Palatinate- Neuburg was abolished in 1808. In the partition of Bavaria in 1837 Palatinate- Neuburg was joined with Swabia but became a part of Upper Bavaria in the 1970s.

They wear boots made of leather and sometimes as well sandals. The Kurdish costume was worn many days in the past. Currently some women still wear them on a daily basis, especially by the older generation. The dresses worn on a daily basis tend to be modest in colour and have little or no accessories or embroideries. In the present day the Kurdish dress is more commonly worn on special occasions. The traditional Kurdish women's outfit includes either a vest or long-sleeved jacket or long overcoat worn over a gown. An underdress and puffy pants are worn beneath the gown. A belt over the gown is also needed. Traditionally women wore Kurdish hats ornamented with valued coloured stones, beads and gold pieces. Over time this has become less common. Now it is more popular among women to only accessorise with gold jewellery. Usually younger women and young girls wear brightly coloured dresses adorned with many beads and sequins, and the older women wear darker colours. However, older women tend to wear more gold jewellery because traditionally when women married they would receive a dowry of gold jewellery pieces from their groom.

Kurdish women's dress, modernized with minimalist style * Vest, long-sleeved jacket and overcoat: This is either made from a plain fabric, a velveteen fabric or a sequin covered fabric. * Gown: This is usually the dazzling masterpiece of the outfit. Most commonly, Kurdish women wear a mesh fabric or a sheer fabric which is ornamented skillfully with many beads or sequins, or both. The embroidery can be the same colour as the fabric, or multicoloured to create a bright dress. The brightly coloured outfits characterize the spirit of the Kurdish people. There are many different structural designs of the gown. The most common ones today are the traditional Kurdish region gown, which is straight top to bottom with very long sleeves, and the Kurdish-Iranian gown which is frilly from the waist down. * Under layers: The under dress and trousers are made of a plain satin fabric usually matching the colour of the gown. * Belt: Fabric belts are colour coordinated with any piece of the outfit. Married women tend to wear gold belts. There are two common types: ** Lira belt; a gold belt made entirely from connected gold lira coins or dangling gold liras ** Gobarah belt: similar to a lira belt, but the coins are inexpensive * Trousers: These are a type of traditional Kurdish clothing for men. It consists of two main parts: rank and chogha. **The rank is worn like pants, but is usually almost twice as wide than normal pants. **The chogha is like a jacket, but the bottom of it goes inside the chogha. In addition, a shirt must be worn under the chogha. * Traditional hat: This is usually black velveteen ornamented with traditional amber, turquoise beads,Kurdish photos – 'A little Kurdish girl' and gold or silver charms. * Traditional jewellery: This is gold, with gold charms and traditional amber, red or black beads and occasional dangling lira coins. * Sheelana: This is a long gold necklace with amber, red or black beads and dangling leaf shaped charms. * Meglad: This is a big black stone dangling from a gold chain.  Modern dress  Kurdish men's traditional clothing The modern Kurdish women dress are not traditionally. They tend to be fashionable amongst Kurdish community. Kurdish women and men have a large collection of Kurdish clothing and are always on the lookout for new designs and fabric. They usually buy the fabrics of their choice and then have clothing tailored, as there are tailors who specialize in making Kurdish clothes. Recently these respected tailors have turned into designers that have created different designs for the conventional structure of the dress. In villages most of the time women tailor for their entire family after everyone makes their own fabric choice. There many different styles of the Kurdish clothes, and in recent years there have been many fashion shows, showcased for a Kurdish and international audience. Shows have been held in Vancouver, Canada; in Melbourne, Australia, at the Kurdish Film Festival by the Kurdish Women's Society; and at the Hackney Museum as part of their Kurdish Cultural Heritage Project.

It reflected the need of unity within the religiously divided Bulgarian state as well as the need for equal acceptance on the international stage in Christian Europe. This process was characterized by the shifting political alliances of Boris I of Bulgaria (ruled 852-889) with the kingdom of the East Franks and with the Byzantine Empire, as well as his diplomatic correspondence with the Pope (Responses of Pope Nicholas I to the Questions of the Bulgars). Because of Bulgaria's strategic position, the churches of both Rome and Constantinople each wanted Bulgaria in their sphere of influence. They regarded Christianization as a means of integrating Slavs into their region. After some overtures to each side, the Khan adopted Christianity from Constantinople in 870. As a result, he achieved his goal of gaining an independent Bulgarian national church and having an archbishop appointed to head it. Background Bulgaria under rule of Boris I When Khan Boris began his reign in 852, the international situation in Southeast Europe was characterized by a race for influence in the region, both cultural and political. The conflict with the Byzantine Empire for domination over the Slavic tribes in modern-day Macedonia and Thrace was still far from being resolved. In the middle Danube region, Bulgaria's interests crossed with those of the emerging kingdom of the East Franks and the principality of Great Moravia. It was about that period when Croatia emerged on the international scene, carrying its own ambitions and demands for territories in the region. On a larger scale, the tensions between Constantinople and Rome were tightening. Both centres were competing to lead the Christianization that would integrate the Slavs in South and Central Europe. The Bulgarian Khanate and the Kingdom of the East Franks had established diplomatic relations as soon as the 20s and 30s of the 9th century. In 852, at the beginning of the reign of Khan Boris, a Bulgarian embassy was sent to Mainz to tell Louis II of the change of power in Pliska, the Bulgarian capital. Most probably the embassy also worked to renew the Bulgarian-German alliance. =Initial setbacks= Some time later, Khan Boris concluded an alliance with Rastislav of Moravia (846–870) instigated by the King of the West Franks, Charles the Bald (840–877). The German Kingdom responded by attacking and defeating Bulgaria, forcing Khan Boris to later re-establish an alliance with the German king directed against Great Moravia, a Byzantine ally. The situation held great risk for the weakened Bulgarian state. War broke out with the Byzantine Empire between 855 and 856. The Byzantines wanted to regain control over some fortresses on the Diagonal Road (Via Diagonalis or Via Militaris) that went from Constantinople, through Philippopolis (Plovdiv), to Naissus (Niš) and Singidunum (Belgrade). The Byzantine Empire was victorious and reconquered a number of cities, with Philippopolis being among them.Gjuzelev, p. 130 In 861 Khan Boris concluded an alliance with East Frankish King Louis the German, all while informing him that he would like to accept Christianity according to western rite. This renewed alliance threatened Great Moravia, which sought help from Byzantium (862–863). This was at the same time when a Byzantine mission to Great Moravia was taking place. Cyril and his brother Methodius intended to draw Great Moravia closer to Constantinople and strengthen the Byzantine influence there. Khan Boris was more interested in the first Slavonic alphabet Cyril and Methodius had created. Bulgaria wanted to implement the Slavonic alphabet as well as a means to stop the cultural influence of the Byzantine Empire. In the last months of 863 the Byzantines attacked Bulgaria again, probably after having been informed by their Moravian allies that Boris told the German king he was willing to accept Christianity and Byzantium had to forestall him from taking up Christianity from Rome. A Rome-dependent Bulgaria in the hinterland of Constantinople was a threat to the Byzantine Empire's immediate interests. Aligning with the East The baptism of St. Boris I. Before any actual military engagements took place, Khan Boris was forced to sue for peace due to being unprepared for war because of Bulgaria being badly affected by crop failure and earthquakes that year, which Boris may have taken for a sign to convert according to the eastern rite. Negotiations were set up and Boris promised to convert to Eastern Orthodox Christianity along with his people, requesting missionaries to come to Bulgaria and begin the process. The two sides concluded a \\"deep peace\\" for a 30-year period. In exchange for Bulgaria's conversion, the Byzantines returned previously conquered lands. In the late autumn of 864, a mission from the Patriarch of Constantinople Photios arrived at the Bulgarian capital Pliska and converted the Khan, his family and high-ranking dignitaries. Boris was given the Christian name Michael (after then Byzantine Emperor Michael III) and, according to most scholars, changed his title to the Slavic equivalent of King (Knyaz). After that the Bulgarian population began converting to Christianity. Reasons for Christianization Following the conquests of Khan Krum of Bulgaria at the beginning of the 9th century, Bulgaria became an important regional power in Southeastern Europe. Its future development was connected with the Byzantine and East Frankish empires. Since both of these states were Christian, Pagan Bulgaria remained more or less in isolation, unable to interact on even grounds, neither culturally nor religiously. After the conversion of the Saxons, most of Europe became Christian. The preservation of paganism among the Bulgars and the Slavs, the ethnic groups that formed, along with the local, Romanized (later called Vlachs) or Hellenized Christian Thracian population, the Bulgarian people and nation brought another disadvantage — the pagan & Christian ethnic groups' unification was hampered by their different religious beliefs. Christianity had its roots in the Bulgarian lands prior to the formation of the Bulgarian state through the native populations mentioned above. Reaction The Bulgarians pray to God for a famine to go away Louis the German was not satisfied with Boris' plan, but he did not carry his fears on to open conflict. As Byzantine missions converted the Bulgarians, their forces encouraged the people to destroy the Pagan holy places. Conservative Bulgarian aristocratic circles opposed such destruction, as they had led the spiritual rituals. In 865, malcontents from all ten administrative regions (komitats) revolted against Knyaz Boris, accusing him of giving them \\"a bad law\\". The rebels moved toward the capital, intending to capture and kill the Knyaz and to restore the old religion. All that is known is that Knyaz Boris gathered people loyal to him and suppressed the revolt. It's noted that God's miracle helped Boris to win the battle, and the armor that he was wearing during battle was asked from the Pope as a gift. He ordered the execution of the leaders of the revolt - boyars and all of their sons - 52 rebels.http://newspaper.kultura.bg/bg/article/view/12512 The common folk who \\"wished to do penance\\" were allowed to go without harm. Until the end of his life, Knyaz Boris was haunted by guilt about the harshness of killing the sons of the revolt's leaders and the moral price of his decision in 865. In his later correspondence with Pope Nicholas I, the Knyaz asked whether his actions had crossed the borders of Christian humility. The Pope answered: Different interpretations of the historical records have led some historians to believe the Knyaz executed almost half the Bulgarian aristocracy to end the religious and political conflict. His aristocratic opponents had feared that the Byzantine Empire would spread its influence through Christianity and destroy Bulgaria. At this time during the Middle Ages, Bulgarians considered \\"Christians\\" as equivalent to their traditional competitors the \\"Byzantines\\", or \\"Greeks\\", as they were most often called. Many Bulgarians thought that along with Christianity, they would be forced to accept the Byzantine way of life and morals. Choice between Rome and Constantinople Ballshi Inscription Knyaz Boris realized that the Christianization of his subjects would result in greater Byzantine influence. The liturgy was performed in the Greek language, and the newly established Bulgarian Church was subordinate to the Church of Constantinople. The revolt against the new religion prompted the Knyaz to ask Constantinople to allow the Bulgarian Church independent status. When Constantinople refused to grant the Bulgarian Church independence, Knyaz Boris turned to the Pope. At the end of August 866, a Bulgarian mission led by the kavhan Peter arrived in Rome, carrying a list of 115 questions from Knyaz Boris. These had to do with the Christian way of life of the newly converted Bulgarians and the potential organization of a future Bulgarian Church under Rome's jurisdiction. On 13 November 866, the Bulgarian Knyaz received the Pope's 106 answers. Formosa from Portua and Paul of Populon led the Pope's mission. At the same time, the Pope sent other emissaries to Constantinople. When the Roman clerical mission arrived, Boris was sufficiently satisfied with Rome's response that he ordered the Byzantine mission to leave Bulgaria. This was viewed as an official change of Bulgarian orientation from Constantinople to Rome. Seeing Rome's emissaries there, the German mission also left Bulgaria, satisfied that Bulgaria will be in the Roman diocese. Emperor Michael III was displeased by Bulgaria's banishment of Byzantium's clergy. In a letter to Knyaz Boris, the Byzantine emperor expressed his disapproval of Bulgaria's religious reorientation by using offensive language against the Roman Church. This sparked the old rivalry between the two branches of Christianity. In less than two years, Bulgaria's name became widely known in Western Europe. In Constantinople, people nervously watched the events taking place in Bulgaria. They believed a pro-Roman Bulgaria threatened Constantinople's immediate interests. A religious council was held in the summer of 867 in the Byzantine capital, during which clerics criticized the Roman Church's actions of recruiting Bulgaria. Pope Nicholas I was anathematized. Without losing time, Knyaz Boris asked the Pope to appoint Formosus of Portus, who years later became Pope Formosus, as Bulgarian archbishop. The Pope refused, with the official response being that Formosa already had an eparchy. The Pope ordered new leaders, Dominic of Trivena and Grimwald of Polimarthia, of a mission to be sent to Bulgaria. Soon after, Nicolas died. His successor, Pope Adrian II (867-872), also failed to respond to Knyaz Boris' request for appointment of a Bulgarian archbishop. Knyaz Boris proposed another candidate for Bulgarian archbishop, Marinus. Deacon Marinus at this time was a papal legate in Constantinople and did not have an eparchy, but the Pope refused. Instead, he received a cleric named Silvester, a man so low in the hierarchy that was not authorized to carry out liturgy by himself. After he had a three-day stay in Pliska, the Bulgarians sent him back to Rome accompanied by emissaries carrying a letter of complaint by Knyaz Boris. Boris perceived Rome's refusals of his request and delays as an insult and a sign of the Pope's unwillingness to coordinate selection with him of a Bulgarian archbishop. Marinus became Pope just a few years later with the name Pope Marinus I. As a result, Boris began negotiations again with Constantinople, with whom he expected more cooperation than shown in the past. But, on 23 September 867, Emperor Michael III was killed by his close acquaintance Basil, who established the Macedonian dynasty that ruled the Empire until 1057. Patriarch Photius was replaced by his ideological rival Ignatius (847-858; 867-877). The new rulers of the Byzantine Empire quickly lessened tensions between Constantinople and Rome. Pope Adrian II needed the help of Basil I against the Arabs' attacks in Southern Italy. On the other hand, Byzantium anticipated the Pope's support for Patriarch Ignatius. Result As a result of the leaders' agreements, a Church Council was held in Constantinople. After the end of the official conferences, on 28 February 870 Bulgarian emissaries arrived in Constantinople, sent by the Knyaz and led by the Ichirguboil (the first councilor of the Knyaz) Stasis, the Kan-Bogatur (high-ranking aristocrat) Sondoke, the Kan-Tarkan (high-ranking military commander) among others. Few people suspected the real purpose of these emissaries. On 4 March Emperor Basil I closed the council with a celebration at the Emperor's palace. In attendance was the Bulgarian Kavkan (roughly a vicekhan or viceknyaz) Peter. After he greeted the representatives of the Roman and Byzantine Churches (the Roman being first), Kavkan Peter asked under whose jurisdiction the Bulgarian Church should fall. The Roman representatives were not prepared to discuss this matter. There appeared to have been a secret agreement between the Byzantine Patriarch, the Emperor and the Bulgarian emissaries. The Orthodox fathers immediately asked the Bulgarians whose clergy they had found when they came to the lands which they now ruled. They answered \\"Greek\\". The Orthodox fathers declared that the right to oversee the Bulgarian Church belonged only to the Constantinople Mother Church, which had held jurisdiction on these lands in the past. The protests of the Pope's emissaries were not taken into account. With the approval of the Knyaz and the Fathers of the Council, the Bulgarian Church was declared an archbishopric. The archbishop was to be elected among the bishops with the approval of the Knyaz. The creation of an independent Bulgarian archbishopric was unprecedented. Usually, independent churches were those founded by apostles or apostles' students. For a long period, Rome had been challenging Constantinople's claim of equality to Rome on the grounds that the Church of Constantinople had not been founded by an apostle of Christ. Prior to the middle of the 9th century, in the practice of the formally united Church, there were no precedents for creating national churches among newly converted peoples. Such nationalization of the church and liturgy was exceptional and not at all part of the practice of other European Christians. Bulgaria created this precedent and set the example for others to follow. Just six years after his conversion, the Orthodox Church granted Knyaz Boris a national independent church and a high-ranking supreme representative (the archbishop). Over the next 10 years, Pope Adrian II and his successors made desperate attempts to regain their influence in Bulgaria and to persuade Knyaz Boris to leave Constantinople's sphere. The conversion of the Bulgarians to Christianity and the establishment of the Bulgarian national Church set the grounds for an unprecedented cultural prosperity in Bulgaria which began after the arrival of the disciples of Saints Cyril and Methodius, who under the patronage of Knyaz Boris implemented their teachers' Slavonic alphabet and established literary schools in Pliska and Ohrid. This later led to the Slavic Old Church Slavonic becoming the official language of the Bulgarian Church and State in 893 AD during the Council of Preslav and also the beginning of the Golden Age of medieval Bulgarian culture during which the Cyrillic alphabet was created.

They are composed of: the Army, the Air Force, the Navy, the Royal Guard and the Military Emergency Unit, as well as the so-called Common Corps. Spain is one of the most militarily powerful nations of the European Union (EUFOR) and Eurocorps. It also occupies a prominent position in the structure of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which it joined in 1982. It also has the oldest Marine Corps in the world and the oldest permanent military units in the world: the King's Immemorial No. 1 Infantry Regiment and the \\"Soria\\" No. 9 Light Infantry Regiment. History During the 15th and 16th century, Spain evolved into Europe's foremost power with the voyages of Christopher Columbus leading to Spain acquiring vast lands in the Americas. During the reign of Charles V and Philip II, Spain reached the peak of its power with the Spanish Empire spanning 19.4 million square km of the earth's surface, a total of 13%. By the mid 17th century this power had been weakened by the Thirty Years War along with financial problems, and the lack of reforms. During the 18th century the new Bourbon dynasty revived Spain's economic and military power through a series of important reforms in the armed forces and the economy, notably those of Charles III of Spain. Thanks to these reforms, Spain performed well during the war of Jenkins' Ear, the war of Austrian Succession but with mixed result during the Seven Years' War. Spain had recovered considerably by the outbreak of the French Revolution. The occupation of a great part of Spain by the French during the Napoleonic Wars resulted in the so-called war of Spanish independence, which was characterised by use on a large scale of guerrilla troops, made necessary by the war's devastating effect on the Spanish economy. Following the war, the Spanish military was in poor condition and political instability resulted in the loss of most of Spain's former colonies, except Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines. These too would be lost later in the Spanish–American War. =Today= Spain participated along with France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Denmark, the United States and Canada in the offensive against Moammar Gaddafi in Libya, contributing a tanker, 4 F-18 fighter jets, a frigate, a submarine and a surveillance aircraft, along with logistical support from the Naval Base of Rota and the Air Base of Morón. Spain has belonged to NATO since 1982. The decision was ratified in a referendum in 1986 by the Spanish people. The conditions were the reduction of American military bases, no integration of Spain in the military structure of NATO, and the prohibition of introducing nuclear weapons in Spain.

In 2006, Spain participated in Darfur (Sudan) by sending observers, and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Spain also participated in the Iraq War between 2003 and 2004, in Gabon and in Senegal to ensurence the maritim traffic in the Horn of Africa (in this one, with 33 civil guards and national police officers, two patrol vessels and a helicopter). Furthermore, in 2015, 46 UME soldiers and 12 civil guards of the High Mountain Group went to help and rescue in the Nepal earthquake, along with six dogs, three scientific police and a Boeing 707 of supplies transport of the Air Force. The cost of these missions abroad amounts to approximately 800 million euros per year. Command structure Cristóbal Colón (F-105) of the Spanish Navy Eurofighter Typhoon of the Spanish Air Force The commander in chief of the Armed Forces is the King of Spain; with the ex officio rank of Capitán General in the Army, Navy and Air Force. The Spanish Constitution of 1978 states in article 62(h) that the King of Spain shall have \\"supreme command of the Armed Forces\\"; however under article 64, all official acts of the King must be countersigned by the President of the Government (or other competent minister) to become valid. The President of the Government (also known as Prime Minister in English translations), as the head of government, is responsible under article 97 for \\"domestic and foreign policy, civil and military administration and the defence of the State\\", and thus bears the ultimate responsibility before the Cortes Generales, and the Spanish electorate. The Minister of Defence, a member of the Government, is in charge of running the Ministry of Defence which carries out the day-to-day administration of the forces. The President of the Government and the Minister of Defence are civilians. No provision in the Constitution requires the Government to seek approval from the Cortes Generales before sending the armed forces abroad. The Chief of the Defense Staff is the Spanish equivalent of a chief of defence, directs the Defense Staff and is the senior military advisor to the Minister and the Government. The military leadership of the three military services are: the Chief of Staff of the Army, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force and the Chief of Staff of the Navy. The structure is: # 20px Commander in Chief: Capitán General of the Armed Forces H.M. The King of Spain, Felipe VI. # 20px President of the Government: The President Pedro Sánchez. # 20px Minister of Defence: The Most Excellent Madam Minister Margarita Robles. # 20px Chief of the Defence Staff: The Most Excellent Army General Fernando Alejandre Martínez. # The Chiefs of Staff of the branches: #: 20px Chief of Staff of the Army: The Most Excellent Army General Francisco Javier Varela Salas. #: 20px Chief of Staff of the Navy: The Most Excellent General admiral Teodoro E.

The Spanish Air Force is replacing older aircraft in the inventory with newer ones including the recently introduced Eurofighter Typhoon and the Airbus A400M Atlas airlifter. Both are manufactured with Spanish participation; EADS CASA makes the Eurofighter's right wing and leading edge slats, and participates in the testing and assembly of the airlifter.http://www.airbus.com/en/presscentre/pressreleases/press- release/detail/first-a400m-wings-delivered-to-final-assembly-line/news- browse/1/news-period/1175378400/2591999/archived/news- category/press_release/?tx_felogin_pi1%5Bforgot%5D=1 Its aerobatic display team is the Patrulla Aguila, which flies the CASA C-101 Aviojet.Its helicopter display team, Patrulla Aspa, flies the Eurocopter EC-120 Colibrí.

Located on a hill overlooking Ofra within the municipal boundaries of the Mateh Binyamin Regional Council, the village was founded in 1995 on privately owned Palestinian land. As of 2012, its population was around 200. As of October 2013, the outpost lodged 42 families. It was evacuated completely in February 2017 in compliance with a ruling by the Israeli Supreme Court. The High Court of Israel ruled in 2006 that the settlement is illegal under Israeli law,Motti Inbari, Jewish Fundamentalism and the Temple Mount: Who Will Build the Third Temple?, pp. 166–167. SUNY Press, 2009 but as of March 2013, its status remained unresolved as the Israeli government continued to fight the court's eviction order. In May 2014 an Israeli police investigation revealed the entire outpost lay on private Palestinian land, and that documents used by settlers to claim they had purchased the sites were forged. In December 2014, the Israeli High Court ordered the state to completely evacuate and demolish the settlement within two years. The international community considers all Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law.

It is usually categorized as an outpost because its construction was never officially approved by the Israeli government, although according to the settlers, the state played a role in supporting the outpost through the provision of electricity and other services by Israeli utilities. Amona has become highly symbolic, revealing the role in the settlement enterprise of the settlement movement, the Israeli State and the Court. In 1997, the first demolition order was issued, followed by another one in 2003. In 2006, settlers were evacuated, but only nine permanent buildings were razed. In 2008, the state said that construction on the site was illegal and announced that the entire outpost would be razed. In 2011, the announcement was repeated, but as of January 2015, the outpost was still there.The Amona complex. Haaretz, 16 October 2013 2005 petition In 2004, the Amana settlement organization completed the construction of nine permanent homes at Amona, all built illegally on privately owned land and appropriately registered to Palestinians. In October 2004, the Israeli Civil Administration ordered the demolition of the structures. On 3 July 2005, Peace Now petitioned the Israeli High Court charging Israeli authorities with failing to implement stop-work orders at the site, and with failing to implement demolition orders issues in October 2004. In November 2005, Israeli Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz ordered the demolition by the end of January 2006.Americans for Peace Now (APN), Settlements in Focus - Vol. 2, Issue 3: Amona Redux. 20 February 2006 = Evacuation = A Jewish home in Amona before the destruction by Israeli forces. The sign reads \\"Every house destroyed a victory for Hamas.\\" On 1 February 2006, settlers and protesters were evacuated, attended with unprecedented clashes. 10,000 Israel Police, Israel Border Police, and Israel Defense Forces troops appeared in Amona to carry out the demolition and to secure the troops involved in the operation. They faced an estimated 4,000 Israeli protesters, one thousand actively protesting inside and around the houses, and another few thousand in the surrounding area. The protesters mostly consisted of youths from across the country, but especially from nearby settlements and schools, some of which had fortified themselves inside the homes and on the roofs in an effort to block, delay, or protest the order being carried out. Over 300 people were injured, including about 80 security personnel. Among the injured were three Knesset members.

Young girls that were evacuated accused police officers of sexual assault. = Parliamentary inquiry = In March 2006, the Knesset parliamentary inquiry into the events at Amona determined that security forces had employed excessive brutality, striking protesters with clubs and charging them with horses. Internal Security Minister Gideon Ezra was criticised for preventing police commanders from testifying at the hearings. The committee also found contradictions in the testimonies of the Army Chief of Staff Dan Halutz and the Internal Security Minister. Despite these findings, no resignations followed. In May 2006 Israeli President Moshe Katsav met with some of the protesters injured at Amona and stated that he would ask for a renewal of the investigation. 2008 petition In 2008, the Israeli non- governmental organization Yesh Din petitioned the Supreme Court on behalf of the Palestinian landowners, demanding the demolition of the entire outpost. The State repeatedly requested a delay. On 28 April 2013, the court granted a last postponement of the evacuation until 15 July 2013.Tovah Lazaroff, \\"High Court delays Amona evacuation until July 15\\". Jerusalem Post, 28 April 2013 As the settlers contended they purchased some of the land in the meantime through the Al-Watan company, the Supreme Court again postponed the execution of the ruling. The court ordered that on 24 July only the uncontested homes and part of the access road should be torn down, pending a petition by the settlers before the Jerusalem Magistrates Court.Tovah Lazaroff, \\"High Court delays evacuation of West Bank outpost Amona\\".

Haaretz, 19 July 2013 At a High Court hearing on 20 August 2013, the state's attorney said that she believed the 24 July ruling applied only to those Amona residents whose names were attached to the petition.Tovah Lazaroff, \\"Amona outpost homes now in High Court’s hands\\". Jerusalem Post, 21 August 2013 In May 2014, a police investigation into the Al-Watan company, a subsidiary of Ze'ev Hever's Amana organization, revealed that the documents filed by Al-Watan and Amona petitioners had been forged. Meanwhile, Yesh Din filed another petition demanding the demolition of some 30 structures that were not evacuated.Yesh Din, Yesh Din today filed a motion ... . 30 July 2013 The Court confirmed that the case was against the entire outpost and that all structures (except the 16 contested homes) should be removed.\\"State: Demolition of Amona diplomatically harmful\\". Tovah Lazaroff, Jerusalem Post, 15 October 2013 On 14 October 2013, the state asked the court for a new postponement, to prevent \\"harm of Israel's diplomatic interests\\", and because there is \\"no concrete petitioner\\" (because it was a general claim). While previously, the evacuation was linked to illegal settlement on privately-owned Palestinian land, this was the first time in the last few years that the state had spoken of the outpost evacuation within diplomatic terms. Commentators suggested that this move alluded to the current peace negotiations. The state also feared a precedent for other cases. 2014 court judgments In June 2014 an Israeli court brought down a judgement awarding 300,000 shekels ($85,700) to 6 Palestinian plaintiffs, the owners affected by the Amona settlement on their land, and further ruled that the State is to pay out a further sum of 48,000 shekels ($13,500) in damages if it fails to remove the settlers by 2015.AFP, 'Palestinian landowners win wildcat settlement payout,' Ynet 25 June 2014 In December 2014, the Israeli Supreme Court ordered the state to completely evacuate and demolish the settlement within two years. The judges wrote \\"These structures were built on privately owned land so there is no possibility of authorizing their construction, even retroactively. The military commander of Judea and Samaria must act decisively to protect the private property of residents who are under his protection, including protection from the usurpation of and illegal construction on their lands. This illegal construction on private land requires giving the highest priority to the enforcement of work stoppage and demolition orders.\\" The judges also stated that it would make no difference if some of the land had been legally purchased since the settlement was established. Complete evacuation The outpost of Amona was evacuated in February 2017 by order from the government of Israel.

Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Bob Clampett. The cartoon was released on January 27, 1945, and stars Daffy Duck. Plot Having read about the U.S. fighting forces pushing the Nazi troops back during World War II (\\"A smashing frontal attack on the enemy rear?\\"), Daffy Duck is in a patriotic mood. However, his mood quickly changes to fear when he gets a phone call that \\"the little man from the draft board\\" wants to see him. Hiding in his house, Daffy looks out, eventually seeing the little man, who attempts to hand him a telegram (presumably with Daffy's conscription order). Daffy starts whining, and continues to try to outrun the little man, who seems to be everywhere that Daffy happens to be at the moment. Daffy even goes so far as to plant a bomb near the man. Finally, he locks him in a safe, bricks the safe up, puts up a wall over the bricks (chortling: \\"So long, Dracula!\\"), runs to the roof and takes off in a rocket. However, the rocket soon plunges back to earth, causing Daffy to crash-land in Hell without Daffy actually saying the word. Shrugging off this turn, Daffy spots a demon (seen from the rear) and tells him: \\"Oh well, anyway, I sure put one over on that dope from the draft board!\\" The demon takes off his mask to reveal he's the man from the draft board, who then replies with a popular catchphrase of the \\"Richard Q. Peavey\\" character from The Great Gildersleeve: \\"Well, now, I wouldn’t say that\\" (same as what Bugs Bunny says at the end of The Old Grey Hare) and proceeds to chase Daffy into the distance, letter still in hand, at iris out.

Stevenson\\" Frances Lloyd George, Countess Lloyd-George of Dwyfor, (née Stevenson 7 October 1888 – 5 December 1972) was the mistress, personal secretary, confidante and second wife of British Prime Minister David Lloyd George. Frances Louise Stevenson was born in London. She was the daughter of a Lowland Scottish father and a mother of mixed French and Italian extraction. She was educated at Clapham High School, where in the fifth form she had made friends with Mair, Lloyd George's oldest daughter, and then at Royal Holloway College where she studied Classics. In July 1911, Lloyd George, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, hired Stevenson as a governess for his youngest daughter Megan. Lloyd George and Stevenson were soon attracted to each other. Although Stevenson, who wanted a conventional marriage and many children, hesitated about becoming the mistress of a married man, she agreed to become Lloyd George's personal secretary on his terms, which included a sexual relationship, in 1913. She was created a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1918 New Year Honours and accompanied Lloyd George to the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. The delegates were under the impression she was still just his secretary.Ruth Longford, Frances, Countess Lloyd-George: More than a mistress, Gracewing, Leominster, 1996, p 54. In 1921 she wrote a series of articles about the delegates to the conference for The Sunday Times, which were collected and published by Cassells as Makers of the New World under the pseudonym \\"One Who Knows Them\\". Stevenson chose the location and supervised the construction of Lloyd George's house Bron-y-de in Churt, Surrey. She also arranged and collated Lloyd George's extensive archive of personal and political papers so that he could write his War Memoirs. After having had two abortions, Stevenson gave birth to a daughter, Jennifer, in 1929. Stevenson had been having an affair with Thomas Tweed, a novelist and Liberal Party official. Stevenson encouraged Lloyd George to believe the child was his, but it is more likely that her father was Tweed. Two years after Lloyd George's wife Margaret died, Stevenson married Lloyd George on 23 October 1943 despite the disapproval of Lloyd George's children from his first marriage.Frances Lloyd George, The Years that are Past, 42-3, 52-3. Less than 18 months later, Lloyd George died on 26 March 1945. As Dowager Countess Lloyd-George of Dwyfor, she lived at Churt for the rest of her life, devoting her time to her family, charitable activities, perpetuating the memory of Lloyd George and writing. Her memoir The Years That Are Past was published in 1967, and her diary of her life with Lloyd George was published in 1971.

Similar combinations of death with this erotic symbology occur on other Gotland rune and image stones. The images on the Stora Hammars II and IV stones are very worn and not currently decipherable. =Stora Hammars I= Depicted on the Stora Hammars I stone are six panels with mythological, religious and martial background, including panels depicting a woman between two men, a sacrifice scene with a Valknut over an altar, a woman standing between a longship manned with armed warriors and another group of armed men, and a battle scene. Because of the position of the woman in two of the panels, it has been interpreted as illustrating the legend of Hildr and its never-ending battle. The stone includes an image of a warrior about to be hanged from a tree with a Valknut nearby, considered to be Odin's cult symbol, giving validity to reports regarding human sacrifice in Norse paganism. Near the altar is a shaped stone, which one scholar has been suggested may be a cult stone similar to the Elgesem runestone. Detail from Stora Hammars III showing Odin in his eagle fetch (note the eagle's beard), Gunnlöð holding the mead of poetry, and Suttungr. =Stora Hammars III= The Stora Hammars III image stone has four panels, the lower of which shows a ship with warriors. One of the panels has been interpreted as depicting Odin in the form of an eagle taking the mead of poetry, a legend described in section 6 of the Skáldskaparmál.CyberSamurai Encyclopedia of Norse Mythology: Prose Edda - Skáldskaparmál (English).

It has been researched for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and skin diseases, and to prevent rejection after an organ transplant. Ascomycin acts by binding to immunophilins, especially macrophilin-12. It appears that Ascomycin inhibits the production of Th1 (interferon- and IL-2) and Th2 (IL-4 and IL-10) cytokines. Additionally, ascomycin preferentially inhibits the activation of mast cells, an important cellular component of the atopic response. Ascomycin produces a more selective immunomodulatory effect in that it inhibits the elicitation phase of allergic contact dermatitis but does not impair the primary immune response when administered systemically. Ascomycin is produced by the fermentation of Streptomyces hygroscopicus.

His career as a leading sportswriter was effectively ended after Humphries history of child sexual abuse emerged in 2011. In 2017, he pleaded guilty to a number of child sex offences and received a year imprisonment sentence. Maeve Sheehan, writing in the Sunday Independent, noted as his prison sentence concluded in 2019: \\"As one of the few sex offenders who was famous before he went to prison, his crimes ensure his name will stay on the public radar for years to come\\". Early life Humphries was born in London and grew up in Foxfield, Raheny, in Dublin. He was educated at St Joseph's Christian Brothers School in Fairview. He has a Bachelor of Commerce degree and a Higher Diploma in Education from University College Dublin (UCD). He ran unsuccessfully for the office of President of the UCD Student Union in 1986; Ulick Stafford defeated him. The Irish Times Humphries began writing columns for The Irish Times during the early-1990s. His writings contained references to \\"the cunning of paedophiles\\" and of sport as \\"a fine feeding ground for those few sick minds who prey on kids\\". He was for many years a regular among children at a North Dublin Gaelic games club. Besides his regular sports reporting and feature articles, Humphries wrote a Monday column in The Irish Times called \\"Lockerroom\\". A collection of his writings for The Irish Times and Sports Illustrated was published in 2004 as Booked! and was nominated for the William Hill Sports Book of the Year Award. The book's royalties went to Amnesty International. Roy Keane interview Humphries received international attention in May 2002, for his interview with Irish footballer Roy Keane on the island of Saipan, while the national football team were preparing to take part in the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Originally, Humphries planned to write an article based on the interview, but Keane's openly critical remarks about preparations for the World Cup and the attitudes of the team management, the players, and the Football Association of Ireland, led to the interview appearing as a verbatim transcript on the front page of The Irish Times (an almost unheard of action) and continuing inside the newspaper. The resulting furore caused Keane to resign from the squad before the tournament started, and he was also dismissed by the team manager, Mick McCarthy. Niall Quinn book Humphries was the ghost writer of Irish football player Niall Quinn's autobiography, Niall Quinn – The Autobiography, published in 2002. It won the Best Autobiography category in the inaugural British Sports Book Awards,British Sports Book Awards, official website. and was nominated for a William Hill Sports Book of the Year award. The book is not structured chronologically, but rather in the context of Quinn's career swansong, the 2002 World Cup in South Korea and Japan. Gaelic games Humphries volunteered at a North Dublin Gaelic games club. His first book, Green Fields: Gaelic Sport in Ireland, analysed the importance of the Gaelic Athletic Association in Ireland, a recurring theme of his work. His book Dublin V Kerry gave an account of historic clashes between the two dominant teams in Gaelic football of the mid- to late-1970s. =Collaboration with Donal Óg Cusack= Humphries co-wrote Come What May, the autobiography of the openly homosexual hurler Donal Óg Cusack. It won the William Hill Irish Sports Book of the Year. Tony Kenny, PR Manager for William Hill, said at the time: \\"Donal Og's book is an excellently told story of ... someone who wasn't afraid to put themselves forward as a role model to many in sport and life not just in Ireland but across the world.\\" Sexual abuse conviction In 2011, Humphries's child sex abuse came to light when his daughter discovered messages of a sexual nature on an old mobile phone of Humphries; the messages were exchanged between Humphries and a 14-year-old girl with an eating disorder who played at the North Dublin Gaelic games club with which Humphries volunteered. This led to a police investigation that eventually revealed that Humphries had sent the girl thousands of sexually-explicit texts before going on to meet her for sexual acts. Humphries subsequently spent a year in a psychiatric facility, before being arrested in September 2012. He was charged in March 2014. He had not written for The Irish Times since 2011, but was formally suspended after being charged. In March 2017, Humphries pleaded guilty to two counts of defilement of a child and four counts of inviting a child to participate in a sexually explicit, obscene or indecent act. The Irish Times terminated his employment after his guilty plea. Reporting restrictions on the case had been in place until June 2017; they were lifted after three charges involving another girl were dropped. Judge Karen O'Connor sentenced Humphries to years in jail on 24 October 2017. When sentencing, she took into account Humphries's guilty plea and the two character references for the defence from the journalist David Walsh and the hurler Donal Óg Cusack. The chief executive of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre was surprised and disappointed about the sentence's leniency. Prison Humphries began serving his sentence at the Midlands Prison in Portlaoise. Humphries was offered therapy but declined, having earlier claimed he was remorseful for his crimes while in court. In prison, he shared a landing with Graham Dwyer, who murdered Elaine O'Hara, and shared his cell with John Tighe, who murdered his baby son. While serving his sentence he called a prison officer an \\"uneducated turnkey\\". The officer was reported by the Irish Independent at the time to have responded: \\"I would rather be an uneducated turnkey than an educated paedophile\\". He studied Spanish while in jail, believed to be an indicator of his intentions upon completion of his sentence; Humphries spent time in Spain before his trial. Humphries was released from prison on 16 August 2019, having served 19 months.

Wodehouse, first published in the United Kingdom on 11 October 1935 by Herbert Jenkins, London, and in the United States on 3 January 1936 by Little, Brown and Company, Boston.McIlvaine (1990), pp. 69–70, A54. The two editions are significantly different, though the plot remains the same.Hall (1974), p. 63–64. The novel was serialised in The Passing Show magazine (UK) from 21 September to 23 November 1935, and this version was published as the UK edition. For its US magazine appearance, in the Red Book, between August 1935 and January 1936, Wodehouse re-wrote the story, reducing its length, and this became the US book edition. The story concerns the complicated love life of amiable young Monty Bodkin, the nephew of Sir Gregory Parsloe-Parsloe, who had previously appeared in Heavy Weather (1933), when he was employed as the latest in the long line of Lord Emsworth's secretaries. The plot of The Luck of the Bodkins continues into Pearls, Girls and Monty Bodkin (1972), in which Monty, the object of his affections, hockey- playing Gertrude Butterwick, and movie-mogul Ivor Llewellyn all return. Plot The story takes place on an ocean liner, the RMS Atlantic, en route to New York. Monty Bodkin hopes to win back his fiancée Gertrude Butterwick, an England international hockey player travelling to a tournament, who has just ended their engagement without explanation. Their fellow-travellers include Gertrude's cousin Ambrose Tennyson who has accepted a job as a writer for the Superba-Llewellyn film corporation, and Ambrose's younger brother Reggie Tennyson who is being forced by his family to take up an office job in Canada. Also on board are Ambrose's fiancée, Lottie Blossom, a film actress for the Superba-Llewellyn, as well as the movie mogul Ivor Llewellyn (the corporation's president), and Llewellyn's sister-in-law Mabel Spence. Numerous comic misunderstandings occur throughout the novel, many inadvertently due to the well-intentioned ship's steward Albert Peasemarch. Mabel informs Llewellyn that his wife Grayce, who is currently in Paris, has sent a message telling him that he is to smuggle her new pearl necklace through US customs to avoid paying duty. Too afraid of his wife to refuse, Llewellyn frets about the risks for several days, expecially when he misunderstand's Monty's position and incorrectly believes him to be a spy working for the US customs. He tries to bribe Monty by offering him an acting job, but Monty hates acting and refuses. Gertrude tells Monty why she broke off their engagement. From a photograph of him in swimming costume, she had seen his \\"Sue\\" chest tattoo, and thought that it was recent. After Monty explains that he unwisely got the tattoo more than three years ago, during a previous brief entanglement, Gertrude renews their engagement. Monty buys Gertrude a Mickey Mouse toy which opens to reveal chocolates inside. She romantically becomes intensely attached to it. Llewellyn had hired Ambrose Tennyson as a writer under the mistaken belief that he was the famous poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson. When he is told of his error he immediately fires Ambrose. Now lacking a job, Ambrose no longer feels able to marry Lottie as he does not want to rely on her money. Lottie is desperate and takes Gertrude's Mickey Mouse, threatening to tell Gertrude that Monty gave it to her if Monty does not accept Llewellyn's offer and insist that Ambrose be re-hired. Gertrude, growing increasingly suspicous of Monty's relationship with Lottie, calls off the engagement again. Ambrose convinces Lottie to return the toy to Monty, though Monty believes that he has lost Gertrude for good anyway. Reggie and Mabel have grown close during the voyage, and become engaged. Reggie decides to ignore the Canadian office job, and to go with Mabel to California. However, like his brother he is unwilling to rely on his fiancée's money, and he needs a job. Llewellyn agrees to hire Reggie in return for him smuggling the necklace through customs. On arrival in New York, everyone makes it past customs. Reggie privately tells Llewellyn he had hidden the necklace in the Mickey Mouse, but Monty (despite not knowing what it contains) is unwilling to hand it over. Llewellyn agrees to give jobs to both Monty and Ambrose in return for the toy. With Mabel's help, contracts are signed and Llewellyn grabs the toy and leaves. Lottie confesses to Gertrude her attempted blackmail of Monty, and explains that she never had any romantic interest in him, being engaged herself. Gertrude reconciles with Monty once more. Both Monty and Ambrose now have jobs and are free to resume their respective engagements. The steward Peasemarch comes to see Monty and explains that he had found and confiscated the necklace, and the Mickey Mouse is actually empty. However, Peasemarch had held onto the necklace as he did not want Monty to get in trouble, and he reveals that he brought it through customs himself, in his pocket. Wanting to celebrate with the others, Monty is delighted to learn from Lottie that prohibition has been repealed, and calls his hotel's room service to order champagne.

Style A comic effect is created by the incongruous combination of formal and informal language in Wodehouse's narrative passages, as in the beginning of the novel: \\"Into the face of the young man who sat on the terrace of the Hotel Magnifique at Cannes there had crept a look of furtive shame, the shifty, hangdog look which announces that an Englishman is about to talk French.\\" Before the first comma, the passage may be the beginning of a serious novel, but the sudden use of two colloquial words, \\"shifty\\" and \\"hangdog\\", prepares the reader for the semantic incongruity of the last part of the sentence.Hall (1974), p. 90–91. The garrulous steward Albert Peasemarch combines a colloquial, informal manner of speaking with long, formal words, such as when he discovers highly \\"copperising\\" inscriptions on the wall written in \\"undeliable\\" pencil. Hall (1974), p. 60. Peasemarch uses malapropisms, such as when he says philosophically, \\"what helpless prawns [pawns] we are in the clutches of a remorseless fate\\" (ch. 18), and also mis-stresses words, as when he says \\"intricket\\" (meaning intricate).Hall (1974), p. 95. Similarly, Peasemarch makes several attempts to use French phrases. For example, he says \\"see jewness savvay\\" (si jeunesse savait) and \\"fam fatarl\\" (femme fatale).Hall (1974), p. 82. Publication history The illustration on the first UK edition dust jacket was by \\"Abbey\\", and the illustration on the first US edition was by Alan Foster. The Luck of the Bodkins was published with illustrations by \\"Illingworth\\" in The Passing Show magazine (UK).McIlvaine (1990), p. 174, D117.1. Alan Foster illustrated the story in Red Bfook (US).McIlvaine (1990), p. 154, D53.9–14. Wodehouse's earlier 1922 novel The Girl on the Boat also involves a journey on the RMS Atlantic, going from New York to Southampton. Adaptations The story was adapted for radio in 2000 by Patricia Hooker, with Nicholas Boulton as Monty Bodkin, Jonathan Firth as Reggie, Eleanor Tremain as Gertrude, Lorelei King as Lottie, Peter Woodthorpe as Peasemarch, John Guerrasio as Ivor Llewellyn, Barbara Barnes as Mabel, and Ian Masters as Ambrose. It first aired on BBC Radio 4 on 17 June 2000 and was directed by Gordon House.

History The settlement originated as the estate of Peredeltsy, owned by the Leontievs (maternal relatives of Peter the Great), then by Princes Dolgorukov and by the Samarins. After a railway passed through the village in the 19th century, it was renamed Peredelkino. In 1934, Maxim Gorky suggested handing over the area to the Union of Soviet Writers. Within several years, about fifty wooden cottages were constructed in Peredelkino by writers to German designs. Among the littérateurs who settled in Peredelkino were Boris Pasternak, Korney Chukovsky, Arseny Tarkovsky (all three buried at the local cemetery), Ilya Ehrenburg, Veniamin Kaverin, Leonid Leonov, Ilya Ilf, Vsevolod Ivanov, Nikolay Zabolotsky, Boris Pilnyak, Lilya Brik, Konstantin Simonov, Alexander Fadeyev, and Mikhail Bakhtin. Heinrich Neuhaus son's, the pianist Stanislav Neuhaus, after father's dead, has lived with his mother and Boris Pasternak in Peredelkino. Turkish poet Nâzım Hikmet spent the early years of his self- imposed exile in the USSR at Peredelkino. More recently, Yevgeny Yevtushenko, Andrei Voznesensky, Bella Akhmadulina, Robert Rozhdestvensky, and Zurab Tsereteli moved into the area as well. The arrest of author and playwright Isaak Babel, one of the most notorious events of Joseph Stalin's Great Purge, took place in Peredelkino on May 15, 1939. Antonina Pirozhkova, At His Side; The Last Years of Isaac Babel, page 115. Babel was then taken by automobile to the Lubyanka Prison, tortured, and shot by the NKVD. Peredelkino is presumably the source for the name of Mikhail Bulgakov's Perelygino. But, Bulgakov places his Perelygino on the Klyazma, Bolshevo, which is where another writers' colony was. The village is also featured in John le Carré's spy novel The Russia House. In 1988, the cottages of Chukovsky and Pasternak were proclaimed memorial houses, while the area of Peredelkino was designated a \\"historical and cultural reserve\\". A decade later, the dacha of Bulat Okudzhava was also opened to the public as a museum. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Peredelkino was taken over by the Russian new rich. Many new apartment buildings were constructed in Novo-Peredelkino district nearby. , the most notable resident of Peredelkino was Alexy II, Patriarch of Moscow and all Russia. The summer residence of Lukino (originally built in the Russian Revival-style for Baron de Bodé) adjoins the 19th-century church of the Transfiguration of the Saviour. Alexy II died there on December 5, 2008. The territory of the complex is divided between three administrative units: its eastern portion is located in jurisdiction of Western Administrative Okrug of Moscow, its northwestern portion--in jurisdiction of Odintsovsky District of Moscow Oblast, and its southwestern portion--in jurisdiction of Leninsky District of Moscow Oblast.

During his stint in ELO, Kaminski initially tried to imitate his predecessor Wilf Gibson by wearing a cape while playing the violin, but soon acquired his trademark blue violin, which he has played variants of ever since. Kaminski was one of the three remaining string players for the group when Lynne decided to remove them. However, he performed on the tours for the ELO albums Time and Balance of Power, and on the 1983 single \\"Rock 'n' Roll Is King\\".

Konstal 105N 105N is a single module, unidirectional tramcar with four doors on the right side. The design came about as a result of modernisation of Konstal's earlier 13N model. All the electrical systems from the 13N remained unchanged, but the 105N abandoned the streamlined appearance of its predecessor for a more angular look. The side windows were enlarged, and smaller windows were added on the front and sides, leading to its being nicknamed aquarium. These changes made the 105N significantly (approximately 1200 kg) lighter than the 13N and decreased the amount of raw materials used in production. The first models lacked the ability to be connected to one another, and the placement of the electrical system caused problems with humidity. The tram was equipped with electromagnetic, drum and rail brakes. Its chief engineers were Zygmunt Giziński and Wojciech Kozik. The 105N trams were used in all Polish cities with tram systems. During their years of service, most of them were modernized and upgraded to the 105Na variant, so today there are only a few of them remaining.

The narrow-gauge version, 105NW, was used in Bydgoszcz and Łódź, but the cabs were upgraded. The 805N cabs in Łódź were also upgraded to 805Na. Other variants In 1977 4 105NW cabs for Bydgoszcz and Łódź, were made for metre-gauge tracks. 25 units of a new version for Łódź, the 805N were built in 1978. All of these were later upgraded to 805Na standard.

However, as Mees (2003) has shown, the word is an ablaut variant of earl, and is also thought to be linguistically related to the name of the tribe of the Heruli, so it is probably merely an old Germanic military title (see etymology below). Etymology This word is likeliest the Proto-Germanic ancestor of Anglo-Saxon eorl (Modern English earl) and its relatives, meaning \\"man, warrior, noble\\". The word erilaz is likely a derivative of *erǭ sb.f. \\"fight, battle\\", thus the interpretation \\"one who fights, warrior\\", though it has also been connected to *arô sb.m. \\"eagle\\". Cf. Orel (2003:85).

It is bordered by Buckley Road to the east, Hampden Avenue to the north, Chambers Road to the west and Quincy Avenue to the south. The land on which Mission Viejo lies was once a homestead at the corner of Quincy Avenue and Chambers Road. The plot was purchased around 1972 by the Mission Viejo Company of California with the purpose of creating a planned development in the style of Mission Viejo, California with \\"Barcelona\\" entrance walls and \\"Mission Bell\\" street lights. Two parkways (Alicia and Marguerite) are also named in honor of Rancho Mission Viejo's matriarchs. The development opened in September 1972. The subdivision contains parks, a public library branch, homes of various styles, and a Cherry Creek Schools elementary school. Notable features of the subdivision include the circular drive at its center formed by Mission Parkway, Alicia Parkway and Mission Viejo Park. Mission Viejo Park comprises a large part of the interior of the circle, providing walkways, picnic areas, ball fields, and a large space for family and community events. Tollgate Creek also runs along the west edge of the park, next to a paved walkway where residents often walk their dogs.

Mission Viejo HOA Suit Against the City of Aurora  The City of Aurora decided to close the Mission Viejo library branch in 2009 due to budget cuts across the city departments. At the November 17, 2009 Mission Viejo HOA Board of Directors meeting, the Board decided to retain an attorney to seek an injunction against the City's proposed action to close the Mission Viejo branch. The HOA believed the City of Aurora was in breach of a 1973 agreement that the City made with the Mission Viejo Company which obligated the City to furnish library services for 50 years. The Aurora City Council decided on December 5, 2011 to not issue a 90-day notice to close the library. Instead a special study session was held January 30, 2012 to discuss the Mission Viejo branch closure as well as other City library issues. After meeting in mediation with the City of Aurora on January 26, the Mission Viejo HOA and the City of Aurora reached a settlement. The agreement was accepted by the Aurora City Council on February 28. The new agreement ensures that Mission Viejo branch will be open well past the fifteen years remaining on the original contract.

It was situated in the highlands of southeastern Anatolia, near the Gulf of İskenderun, in modern-day Turkey. It encircled the Taurus Mountains and the Ceyhan River. The centre of the kingdom was the city of Kummanni, in the highlands. In a later era, the same region was known as Cilicia.  Land  The expanded Hittite Empire (red) replaces Hatti, including Arzawa and Kizzuwatna c. 1290 BC and borders the Egyptian kingdom (green) The country possessed valuable resources, such as silver mines in the Taurus Mountains. The slopes of the mountain range are still partly covered by woods. Annual winter rains made agriculture possible in the area at a very early date (see Çatalhöyük). The plains at the lower course of the Ceyhan River provided rich cultivated fields.  People  Several ethnic groups coexisted in the Kingdom of Kizzuwatna. The Hurrians inhabited this area at least since the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC. The Hittite expansion in the early Old Kingdom period (under Hattusili I and Mursili I) was likely to bring the Hittites and the Luwians to southeastern Anatolia. The Luwian language was part of the Indo-European language group, with close ties to the Hittite language. Both the local Hittites and the Luwians were likely to contribute to the formation of independent Kizzuwatna after the weakening of the Hittite Old Kingdom. The toponym Kizzuwatna is possibly a Luwian adaptation of Hittite *kez-udne 'country on this side (of the mountains)', while the name Isputahsu is definitely Hittite and not Luwian (Yakubovich 2010, pp. 273–4). Hurrian culture became more prominent in Kizzuwatna once it entered the sphere of influence of the Hurrian kingdom of Mitanni, with whom they shared various degrees of kinship. Puduhepa, queen of the Hittite king Hattusili III, came from Kizzuwatna, where she had been a priestess. Their pantheon was also integrated into the Hittite one, and the goddess Hebat of Kizzuwatna became very important in Hittite religion towards the end of the 13th century BC. A corpus of religious texts called the Kizzuwatna rituals was discovered at Hattusa. Believed to be at present the earliest Indo-European ritual corpus discovered to date.  History  King Sargon of Akkad claimed to have reached the Taurus Mountains (the silver mountains) in the 23rd century BC. However, archaeology has yet to confirm any Akkadian influence in the area. The trade routes from Assyria to the karum in the Anatolian Highlands went through Kizzuwatna by the early 2nd millennium BC. The kings of Kizzuwatna of the 2nd millennium BC had frequent contact with the Hittites to the north. The earliest Hittite records seem to refer to Kizzuwatna and Arzawa (Western Anatolia) collectively as Luwia. In the power struggle that arose between the Hittites and the Hurrian kingdom of Mitanni, Kizzuwatna became a strategic partner because of its location. Isputahsu made a treaty with Hittite King Telepinu. Later, Kizzuwatna shifted its allegiance, perhaps because of a new ruling dynasty. The city-state of Alalakh, to the south, expanded under its new vigorous leader, Idrimi, himself a subject of the Mitannian king Barattarna. King Pilliya of Kizzuwatna had to sign a treaty with Idrimi. Kizzuwatna became an ally of Mitanni from the reign of Shunashura I to that of Hittite King Arnuwanda I, who overran the country and made it a vassal kingdom. The exceedingly rough and unfavourable terrain of the Tarsus Mountains made it likely that to remain in a position of prominence among their Hurrian- and Luwian- speaking neighbours, the Kizzuwanta requested favourable terms and that they were subsequently granted. Kizzuwatna rebelled during the reign of Suppiluliuma I but remained in the Hittite Empire for 200 years. In the famous Battle of Kadesh (c. 1274 BC), Kizzuwatna supplied troops to the Hittite king. As master equestrians, some of the first in the areas south of the Caucasus region, they provided the horses, which were later favoured by King Solomon and allowed the more aggressive use of the Hittite chariot than their Egyptian and Assyrian rivals were able. The Kizzuwatna were master craftsman, mining experts and blacksmiths. Being the first to work \\"black iron\\", which is understood to have been iron of meteoric origin, into weapons such as maces, swords and warheads for spears. Their location in the mineral-rich Tarsus Range gave them ample materials from which to work. Around 1200 BC, an invasion by the Sea Peoples is believed to have temporarily displaced the people of the Cilician plain, bur many among the entourage of the Sea peoples were likely to have been composed of Luwian and Hurrians, possibly to ensure that they had a stake in how the invasions ended for their people, rather than being simple victims of them. After the fall of the Hittite Empire, the Neo-Hittite kingdom Quwe, or Hiyawa, emerged in the area of former Kizzuwatna.

G. Wodehouse, first published in the United Kingdom on 3 April 1936 by Herbert Jenkins, London, then in the United States with a slightly different selection of stories on 24 July 1936 by Doubleday, Doran, New York.McIlvaine (1990), pp. 70–71, A55. The collection, recounting the adventures of various members of the Drones Club (except for the last one), features many familiar characters from Wodehouse's other writings, including Freddie Widgeon and the irrepressible Mr Mulliner. One story, \\"Uncle Fred Flits By\\", features the first appearance of Pongo Twistleton and his Uncle Fred, who featured in four novels, including two appearances at Blandings Castle. The US edition contains a slightly different selection of stories from the UK version. \\"Tried in the Furnace\\" and \\"Trouble Down At Tudsleigh\\" had not previously appeared in the US, and were held back so they could garner greater income from magazine sales. (Both stories eventually appeared in Cosmopolitan.) These two stories were accordingly replaced by three Oldest Member golf stories, \\"There's Always Golf\\", \\"The Letter of the Law\\", and \\"Farewell to Legs\\". These three Oldest Member stories had all appeared in US magazines in 1935 and early 1936; they all later appeared in the UK in Lord Emsworth and Others (1937). After their Cosmopolitan appearances, \\"Tried in the Furnace\\" was included in the US-only collection The Crime Wave at Blandings (1937),McIlvaine (1990), p. 73, B58. and \\"Trouble Down at Tudsleigh\\" was included in the US edition of Eggs, Beans and Crumpets (1940).McIlvaine (1990), pp. 77–78, A62. Contents =\\"Fate\\"= * United Kingdom: Strand, May 1931 * United States: Cosmopolitan, May 1931 (as \\"Compromised!\\") The story is the first in the main Drones Club canon, and stars Freddie Widgeon, who would become one of the two most prominent characters in the Drones Club series, the other being Bingo Little. The story takes place in New York, and was written and published while Prohibition was in effect in the United States. While it is not directly referenced in the story, it is hinted at when Freddie Widgeon drinks from a flask hidden in his hip pocket, and when Mrs. Silvers drinks liquor that her husband made in a still. Freddie Widgeon tries to woo Mavis Peasemarch again in the 1939 short story \\"Bramley Is So Bracing\\". ;Plot At the Drones Club, a Crumpet (a nondescript club member) says that Freddie Widgeon has returned from New York, where he lost the girl he loved. Freddie told the Crumpet that everything happened because of Fate, so there is no reason to worry about it. The Crumpet tells a Bean the following story about what happened. In New York, Freddie is happily engaged to Mavis Peasemarch, an upstanding church-going girl and daughter of Lord Bodsham. One day, Freddie reads (and believes) scandal stories in a tabloid, and later sees a plain-looking girl struggling with a heavy suitcase. Freddie offers to help, and they go to her flat. Fatigued after carrying the suitcase, Freddie rests on a chair and talks to the girl, who is named Myra Jennings. Suddenly, the door bursts open, and three men enter. They remark that their case is open and shut now that they have discovered Mrs. Silvers with a man, and Freddie infers that they are private detectives. When Myra points out they are in the wrong flat, the detectives pay for the door and leave. Freddie tells Mavis and her father what happened, and they become suspicious about Freddie seeing another girl. To clear himself of suspicion, Freddie plans to show Mavis that the girl he helped is plain-looking. He goes to Myra Jennings's flat, but she is out. Myra's neighbour, a beautiful woman wearing a negligee, complains that her room is too hot and persuades Freddie to help her open her window, which is stuck. Mrs. Silvers, as she turns out to be, tells Freddie how she is unhappy with her jealous husband. Freddie holds her hand sympathetically. At that moment, the door flies open, and the detectives appear again. The detectives think Freddie is romantically involved with Mrs. Silvers, and say that Mrs. Silvers should be ashamed. Freddie, offended that they are aspersing a woman's name, injudiciously hits the head detective. He ends up in a prison cell. In the morning, he pays the court fifty dollars, and discovers the scandal of his being discovered with Mrs. Silvers in a newspaper. Deciding he could not convince Mavis or her father of the truth, he returns to England. As his boat docks at Southampton, he sees a very pretty girl drop her vanity bag. He ignores this, having given up on helping damsels in distress. =\\"Tried in the Furnace\\"= * UK: Strand, September 1935 * US: Cosmopolitan, March 1937 The story introduces the recurring character Barmy Fotheringay-Phipps and features Pongo Twistleton. The character Angelica Briscoe would later appear in the Jeeves novel Aunts Aren't Gentlemen (1974). The titular phrase \\"tried in the furnace\\" means being purified or improved by an ordeal. With comedic exaggeration, the title refers to Barmy and Pongo emerging as purer and better after undergoing a difficult experience.The titular phrase is used at the end of the story, when the Crumpet describes Barmy and Pongo's reconciliation: \\"They clasped hands. Tried in the furnace, their friendship had emerged strong and true\\". ;Plot After the annual smoking-concert at the Drones Club, the members praise the knockabout cross-talk act (a comedic slapstick double act) performed by Cyril \\"Barmy\\" Fotheringay-Phipps and Reginald \\"Pongo\\" Twistleton- Twistleton. A Crumpet remarks that Barmy and Pongo underwent an ordeal that nearly ended their friendship. The Crumpet, having heard about what happened from Barmy, narrates the following story. Barmy and Pongo go to the seaside resort Bridmouth-on-Sea to practice their cross-talk act. They see Angelica Briscoe, daughter of the Rev. P. P. Briscoe. She lives in Maiden Eggesford, a nearby town. Both young men become smitten with her. Pongo tells Barmy that he is going to London for a day or two, and Barmy tells him not to hurry, planning to take the opportunity to go see Angelica. The next day, Saturday, Barmy books a room in a pub in Maiden Eggesford, and finds Pongo there. Pongo had lied and also wants to see Angelica. Barmy meets a man a few years older than him called Mr. Briscoe and concludes he is Angelica's brother. Mr. Briscoe introduces Barmy to Angelica, and Barmy agrees to help her run the annual village School Treat on Monday. Pongo learns about this and resents Barmy for coming between him and the girl he loves. Sympathetic to Pongo, Barmy sends a note to Angelica saying Pongo will go in his stead. Pongo is surprised and grateful. However, Angelica asks Barmy to instead accompany the village mothers on their annual outing. Barmy thinks this is proof that she loves him. On Monday, Barmy joins the sixteen mature women in a bus. He is overwhelmed when the women let loose, singing ribald songs and throwing tomatoes at passers-by. They stir up trouble at an amusement park, and Barmy later has to row their sailing boat. After a long day, Barmy returns to the pub. Pongo blames him for sending him to the School Treat, where he was smeared with chocolate and whacked with newspapers by children. They argue, until the barmaid tells them Angelica Briscoe is already engaged to Mr. Briscoe, who is actually her second cousin. Mr. Briscoe had kept this secret because he wanted to get someone else to chaperone the school fair. Barmy and Pongo decide that a girl who would inflict school fairs or troublemaking mothers on someone is not worth bothering about anyway. They clasp hands, their friendship restored. =\\"Trouble Down at Tudsleigh\\"= * UK: Strand, May 1935 * US: Cosmopolitan, May 1939 Wodehouse's earlier story The Girl on the Boat (1922) features a character named Sam Marlowe who studies Tennyson's works to impress a girl. Wodehouse reused this plot point in \\"Trouble Down at Tudsleigh\\", in which Freddie Widgeon reads Tennyson's works to impress April. ;Plot At the Drones Club, a Crumpet tries to sell a book of Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poems, but nobody is interested. The book belongs to Freddie Widgeon, whom the Crumpet is trying to sell the book for. The other Drones are shocked that Freddie would buy such a book. Saying that Freddie bought it to impress a girl, the Crumpet narrates the following story. Freddie goes to a town called Tudsleigh in Worcestershire to fish. He falls in love with April Carroway, the daughter of a family friend residing at Tudsleigh Court. April reads a book titled Collected Works of Alfred, Lord Tennyson to her kid sister Prudence. Freddie acquires a copy. He meets Captain Bradbury, an intimidating man of the British Indian Army and a jealous rival for April's love. Freddie reads Tennyson's \\"Lady of Shalott\\", and impresses April by discussing the poet with her. She agrees to go rowing and then picnic with him. Bradbury threatens Freddie, but Freddie is undeterred. Waiting in the boat the next day, Freddie sees Prudence, who tells him that April cannot come. April wants Freddie to take Prudence instead, and April will try to come later. Freddie and Prudence set off. Prudence feels that Tennyson's heroines are soppy, but Freddie disagrees and says she would do well to behave like any one of them. After lunch, Prudence mentions that she was expelled from school for playing William Tell and trying to shoot an apple off the head of a pig, and she had also set her dormitory on fire playing Florence Nightingale (\\"The Lady with the Lamp\\"). Freddie takes a nap, then finds Prudence gone. He thinks he sees her in the river so he swims in, but it is only her frock. Looking for dry clothes, Freddie enters a nearby unoccupied house. He is changing when he sees Bradbury, clearly the owner of the house, coming to the front door. Alarmed, Freddie bolts the door shut. Bradbury glares at him through the window and goes around the house. Freddie exits through the front door, and realizes he has no trousers on. Driving off in Bradbury's car, Freddie covers his lap with a rug. He sees April Carroway, who found Prudence. Prudence stays in a bush since she lost some of her clothes in the river. Following Freddie's advice, she had tried to imitate Lady Godiva (as described in Tennyson's poem \\"Godiva\\"). April tells Freddie to let Prudence use the rug. Freddie remorsefully must refuse, and he drives off. To hide from Bradbury, he is now growing a beard. A letter from April has proven that the book of Tennyson's works is no longer of any use to him. =\\"The Amazing Hat Mystery\\"= * US: Cosmopolitan, August 1933 * UK: Strand, June 1934 Along with the other Drones Club story \\"Uncle Fred Flits By\\", this story was based on ideas given to Wodehouse by his friend Bill Townend. Unlike most of the protagonists of Wodehouse's Drones Club short stories, neither Percy Wimbolt nor Nelson Cork appear in any other stories. Nelson Cork is mentioned in one other story, the Drones Club short story \\"The Fat of the Land\\" (1958), and a club member with a name similar to Percy Wimbolt, Percy Wimbush, is also mentioned in that story. ;Plot A Bean (a nondescript Drones Club member) is recuperating from an injury in a nursing home. He is playing halma with a nurse when a Crumpet comes to visit and says that everyone is trying figure out \\"the great Hat mystery\\" involving Percy Wimbolt and Nelson Cork. The Crumpet explains by recounting the following story. Percy, who is large, and Nelson, who is small, each want to buy a bespoke top hat from Bodmin, a hatter renowned for always making hats that fit. The two Drones meet at Bodmin's door. Percy is in love with a petite girl named Elizabeth Bottsworth, and wants a new top hat to impress her. Similarly, Nelson wants a new top hat to impress a tall girl named Diana Punter. At home a few days later, Percy sees Bodmin's delivery boy and another boy playing with hats from the delivery boy's boxes. Percy shouts at them, and the boys run off, leaving a hat-box on Percy's steps. Percy takes the hat and goes to see Elizabeth. She claims his hat is too small, but Percy has faith in Bodmin's hats and is certain she is wrong. Appalled by her criticism of Bodmin's hat, Percy leaves. Elsewhere, Diana says Nelson's hat is too large. Nelson thinks it is impossible for any hat from Bodmin not to fit and questions Diana's eyesight. They argue, and Nelson bitterly goes to the Drones Club, where he finds Percy. They agree that girls do not understand hats, though Nelson tries to defend Elizabeth, whom he has always admired, and Percy defends Diana, whom he has always thought highly of. They leave the club, each taking his hat from the cloak-room. Nelson tries talking with Elizabeth to help her reconcile with Percy, but he becomes romantically interested in her. She praises his hat, which she says fits him well. The same occurs with Percy and Diana. Eventually, Elizabeth becomes engaged to Nelson, and Diana gets engaged to Percy. The Crumpet and Bean are happy for the couples but cannot understand why Elizabeth and Diana perceived Percy and Nelson's hats differently. The Bean's nurse suggests that the delivery boy got the hats mixed, and then each man got the correct hat from the club cloak-room; the Crumpet finds this idea ingenious but unlikely, and instead believes it was somehow due to the incomprehensible Fourth Dimension, which the Bean agrees with. =\\"Goodbye to All Cats\\"= * US: Cosmopolitan, November 1934 (as \\"Good-by to All Cats\\") * UK: Strand, December 1934 (as \\"Good-bye to All Cats\\") The title of the story is a pun on the title of Robert Graves's 1929 book Good-Bye to All That. ;Plot At the Drones Club, a kitten wanders into the smoking-room, upsetting Freddie Widgeon. A knowledgeable Crumpet tells an Egg and a Bean that Freddie cannot stand cats. The Crumpet explains by narrating the following story. Freddie is courting Dahlia Prenderby and hopes to marry her. He goes with Dahlia to the Prenderby country house, Matcham Scratchings, to meet her parents, Sir Mortimer Prenderby and Lady Prenderby. They have many cats and dogs. A tortoiseshell cat stands on and kneads a shirt Freddie left on his bed, annoying Freddie. He flings the cat off the balcony, and the cat ends up hitting Sir Mortimer. Freddie apologizes but Sir Mortimer is not pleased about being hit. At dinner with Dahlia, her parents, and various aunts, Freddie tries to make conversation by talking enthusiastically about hunting to Lady Prenderby, but she strongly disapproves. He later accidentally runs into a cat, steps on another cat, and sits on a third cat. Dahlia acts coldly towards Freddie, claiming he dislikes animals. In his bedroom, Freddie looks under the furniture to check for cats. He finds none but is surprised by an unfriendly Alsatian dog (a German Shepherd) on his bed. The dog growls and jumps at Freddie, who flees onto a wardrobe. Freddie is saved by a Pekingese puppy that scares off the Alsatian, and rewards it with his tie. Chewing it and shaking it, the puppy hits its head on the leg of the bed and makes a series of shrieks. The dog quickly recovers, but there is a knock at Freddie's door. It is Biggleswade, the butler, who was told to rescue the puppy from Freddie. Biggleswade has been instructed to strike Freddie with a poker if Freddie resists. Freddie opens the door and sees Lady Prenderby, Dahlia, some aunts, and Biggleswade, with poker. Though Freddie tries to explain, nobody listens. Biggleswade is told to stay in the hall with his poker to make sure Freddie does not harm anyone. Returning to his room, Freddie is alarmed to find a dead cat in his bed. Freddie thinks of sneaking it to the drawing-room where it would be found later, but this proves impossible as Biggleswade remains at his post. Left with no other options, Freddie throws it off the balcony, again inadvertently hitting Sir Mortimer. Freddie is ejected from the house and has no hope of reconciling with Dahlia. He is through with cats. =\\"The Luck of the Stiffhams\\"= * US: Cosmopolitan, November 1933 * UK: Strand, March 1934 ;Plot At the Drones, Pongo Twistleton buys drinks for everyone after winning a bet against Oofy Prosser. Oofy had bet that Adolphus \\"Stiffy\\" Stiffham would never marry Geraldine Spettisbury. Stiffy was employed as secretary by Geraldine's father, the Earl of Wivelscombe, and Lord Wivelscombe did not want his daughter to marry a secretary. Wivelscombe, upon finding the couple in his garden in a close embrace, kicked Stiffy and fired him. A Crumpet tells two Eggs that Stiffy went to American to make his fortune there, and recounts the rest of the story. In New York, Stiffy agrees to bet \\"ten\\" in a game of craps, thinking he is betting ten dollars though the other man really meant ten thousand. Stiffy's luck prevails, and he ultimately wins the equivalent of thirty thousand pounds. He deposits the money in a bank. After celebrating with friends, he wakes up disoriented, and goes to his bank. The bank has closed its doors. Without the money, Stiffy has no hope of marrying Geraldine. Feeling he has nothing to lose, he sends an insulting letter to Wivelscombe. Stiffy then learns from the manager of his hotel that the bank is closed only because it is Sunday. Stiffy did not realize this, since he slept through Saturday. Stiffy returns to England intending to take his letter from Wivelscombe's table before Wivelscombe can read it. Outside Wivelscombe's house, Stiffy throws gravel at Geraldine's window to get her attention, but misses and hits the Earl's window instead. Wivelscombe spots Stiffy. Wivelscombe, who is in an overwrought state (he has a hangover), believes he has seen the ghost of Stiffy. Wivelscombe tells this to Geraldine. Annoyed, she replies that if anything did happen to Stiffy, it is Wivelscombe's fault. Later, Stiffy grabs his letter from Wivelscombe's table, and hides under the table when he hears footsteps. Gascoigne and Wivelscombe enter. Gascoigne reproaches Wivelscombe for having drunk champagne, and does not believe him when Wivelscombe, seeing Stiffy, says that there is a ghost under the table. When Gascoigne looks under the table, Stiffy surreptitiously bribes him. Gascoigne reports that there is nothing there. Stiffy meets with Geraldine in her room, and hides in the cupboard when Wivelscombe enters. Wivelscombe says he saw the ghost go into the cupboard, but Geraldine denies seeing anyone there. She convinces her father that the vision is not a ghost but a warning that something will happen to Stiffy if he is not allowed to return and marry her. To get rid of the ghost, Wivelscombe approves the marriage. The couple is now married. The Crumpet notes that Pongo Twistleton's faith in the Luck of the Sitffhams has been rewarded at Oofy Prosser's expense. =\\"Noblesse Oblige\\"= * US: Cosmopolitan, September 1934 * UK: Strand, November 1934 ;Plot At the Drones, Freddie Widgeon is in a bad mood. A Crumpet says that Freddie lost the girl he loved, which often happens to Freddie, and Freddie's allowance was cut in half. The Crumpet explains by narrating the following story. Freddie accompanies his uncle, Lord Blicester, who pays Freddie his allowance, to Cannes. Freddie is in love with a girl named Drusilla, who is also at Cannes. She opposes gambling, so Freddie tells her that he never gambles. Having taken a gold and lavender tie from his uncle's effects, Freddie is dressed impressively, and a stranger offers him five hundred francs to judge a Peasant Mothers Baby Competition. Freddie is flattered but declines. A shabby-looking man claims to recognize Freddie from school. Freddie does not recognize him, but is moved when the man says that Freddie was his hero. The man asks him for a meal. Freddie misunderstands, thinking the man is asking for a mille, meaning a thousand francs, about equivalent to ten pounds (a lot of money at the time). Freddie remembers that he is about to receive ten pounds from a friend, and feels compelled by his sense of noblesse oblige to give this to the man. Freddie arranges to meet him later. Freddie's ten-pound cheque arrives. He runs into a bookmaker to whom he owes money, and pays him four-fifty francs. To make up the loss, Freddie agrees to judge the baby competition. He selects a winner, and is then told he is actually expected to pay five hundred francs for judging the competition. Freddie is now left with fifty francs. He tries to get money from his uncle, who is playing chemin-de-fer at the Casino, but Blicester refuses. Blicester takes the role of \\"banker\\" in the game and stakes a thousand francs, called the \\"bank\\"; Freddie says \\"Banco\\", meaning he will match the \\"bank\\". Freddie scores a nine (the highest possible score) and wins the thousand francs. Blicester is displeased, and Freddie is scorned by Drusilla, who has seen him gambling. Freddie redeems his counters, and gives the money to the shabby- looking man, who is surprised, as he only expected around fifty francs. Freddie realizes his mistake, but his honour keeps him from trying to get any money back. When the man addresses him as Postlethwaite, Freddie states his name is Widgeon. The man says he thought Freddie was Postlethwaite, as he is wearing their old school tie. The man laughs at the mix-up and then hurries off. Freddie uses his remaining fifty francs to drink cocktails at the Casino before he has to face his uncle. =\\"Uncle Fred Flits By\\"= * US: Redbook, July 1935 * UK: Strand, December 1935 See \\"Uncle Fred Flits By\\". (Drones Club story with Pongo Twistleton and Uncle Fred.) =\\"Archibald and the Masses\\"= * US: Cosmopolitan, August 1935 * UK: Strand, February 1936 The characters Archibald Mulliner, Aurelia Cammarleigh, and Meadowes previously appeared in \\"The Reverent Wooing of Archibald\\". ;Plot After the topic of socialism comes up at the Angler's Rest, Mr Mulliner tells the following story about his nephew, Drones Club member Archibald Mulliner. Archibald Mulliner, who can imitate a hen laying an egg, is engaged to Aurelia Cammarleigh. Archibald is rich and lives in a fashionable part of London. One day, he is stopped by a seedy-looking stranger who asks for money to buy bread, though he actually wants to buy alcohol. Archibald gives him five pounds and starts thinking seriously about life. Later, he tells his valet Meadowes that there are people who don't have bread. Meadowes, a member of a revolutionary group, tells Archibald that there is indeed poverty in parts of London like Bottleton East, and gives Archibald some pamphlets. Within two weeks, Archibald is converted to socialist views. While with Aurelia, he broods on the situation in Bottleton East. Aurelia is upset that Archibald has become so serious and has stopped doing his entertaining hen-imitation. Archibald talks about politics and plans to visit Bottleton East the following evening. Aurelia is annoyed and says she will end their engagement if he does not come see her the next day instead. Archibald visits Bottleton East to sympathize with the masses. He is disappointed to find it bright and jovial. Children are playing hop-scotch, not asking for bread. Archibald is determined to give bread to a child and buys a loaf for a small boy. The boy is vexed, since he had hoped for sweets, and throws the loaf at Archibald. Next, Archibald goes into a pub and tells the shirt-sleeved man behind the counter that he will buy a round for everyone. Archibald becomes very popular, until he is unable to pay because his wallet is gone. He believes he left it at the baker's shop. Archibald gets thrown out and then runs away. He now hates the masses and wants to return to Mayfair, but does not know the way. After wandering around, he is hungry and finds a pub where he can eat. He exchanges his locket for a meal. After he eats, a drunk man gets angry at him for wearing a collar and not eating his fat. The shirt-sleeved man comes and is surprised to see Archibald again. Archibald had travelled in a circle and come to the same pub. Crashing resounds through the room and Archibald escapes again. Around three in the morning in Mayfair, Archibald imitates a hen beneath Aurelia's window. This irritates the neighbours and a constable grabs Archibald's shoulder. Archibald punches the policeman and repeats his imitation to get Aurelia's attention. She notices him and is delighted. The policeman grabs him again and assures him he will get fourteen days without the option of a fine. Aurelia promises she will be waiting for Archibald when he comes out. =\\"The Code of the Mulliners\\"= * US: Cosmopolitan, February 1935 * UK: Strand, April 1935 ;Plot A discussion about a breach of promise case leads to Mr Mulliner talking about the code of the Mulliners, which states that en engagement cannot be broken off by the male contracting party. He tells the following story about his nephew Archibald. Archibald Mulliner is happily engaged to Aurelia Cammarleigh. However, her manner becomes cold. Archibald's mother, Lady Wilhelmina Mulliner, is friends with Aurelia, so Archibald goes to ask her about it. He is about to approach Lady Mulliner when he sees her stick her tongue out and repeat \\"QX\\" over and over again. Archibald believes Aurelia must have seen his mother having one of these spells and thought she was loony. Archibald feels he cannot marry Aurelia if there is insanity in his family. The code of the Mulliners prevents him from breaking their engagement himself. He plans to make Aurelia want to break their engagement by insulting her father, Sir Rackstraw Cammarleigh, to whom Archibald has always been deferential. Archibald has dinner with Aurelia and her parents. Sir Rackstraw, who often tells the same stories, begins telling one and asks Archibald casually to stop him if he's told it before. He is surprised when Archibald does stop him, saying that he has heard the story six times and that it is a rotten story. Lady Cammerleigh thanks Archibald, since she has put up with her husband's stories for a long time but not been brave enough to say anything. Aurelia and the butler Bagshot feel the same way and thank Archibald. Sir Rackstraw realizes he has become a bore, and also thanks Archibald. Aurelia was cold before because Archibald was so meek towards her father. She is now happy and wants to dine with him at the Savoy the next day. Archibald's next idea for getting Aurelia to break the engagement is to find an actress to pretend to be a wronged ex-fiancée of his. On his way to a theatrical agent, he bumps into Yvonne Maltravers, an affable and stout young actress. Archibald tells her about his situation, and she helps come up with the plan. She will appear at the Savoy as an ex-fiancée bringing a breach of promise case against Archibald. Archibald goes to meet Aurelia at the Savoy, nervous about the scene about to unfold because his friends and many gossip columnists are dining there. Archibald sees his mother at the restaurant, and Aurelia remarks that she looks better since she started her \\"QX\\" exercises, which make the chin and neck thinner. Lady Cammerleigh learned about the exercise from Aurelia. Now that he knows this, Archibald talks to Yvonne before she can approach him and Aurelia. She speaks in a hush, having lost her voice from doing \\"QX\\" exercises. Archibald tells her the plan is off anyway and he will send her a cheque. Archibald tells Aurelia that he wants a spare bishop for their wedding, in case the first one strains his voice doing this popular neck exercise. =\\"The Fiery Wooing of Mordred\\"= * US: Cosmopolitan, December 1934 * UK: Strand, February 1935 ;Plot After someone complains about a young man who started a fire at the Angler's Rest by throwing his cigarette into a wastepaper basket, Mr Mulliner tells the following story about his nephew, Mordred. Mordred Mulliner, a poet, goes to the dentist. In the waiting room, he meets Annabelle Sprockett-Sprockett, daughter of Sir Murgatroyd and Lady Aurelia Sprockett-Sprockett of Smattering Hall, Worcestershire. Mordred falls in love with her immediately. Annabelle rarely gets to visit London and wants more time for window-shopping, so Mordred gives her his earlier appointment. When she is done and returns to the waiting room, he throws his cigarette into the wastepaper basket. This startles Annabelle and he retrieves the cigarette, explaining that he is absent-minded and often throws cigarettes into wastepaper baskets. He has burned two flats already this year. The next day, Mordred receives a letter from Lady Sprockett-Sprockett. She is grateful for Mordred's kindness towards Annabelle and invites him to visit. Mordred happily sends a telegram accepting the invitation. At Smattering Hall, Mordred is discouraged when he sees that there are six other young unmarried men there, all impressive and handsome. The Sprockett-Sprockett family is genial towards Mordred and provide him with plenty of cigarettes, but he is too concerned about his rivals to be cheerful. At night, Sir Murgatroyd accompanies him to his room and makes sure he has enough cigarettes, as well as other things he might need like paper and a wastepaper basket. Mordred smokes a cigarette and writes a poem about Annabelle. This takes many attempts and the wastepaper basket fills with discarded sheets. He takes a stroll outside, then notices that his bedroom curtains are on fire. He shouts, and the other young men efficiently put out the fire. Mordred fumbles with buckets of water and only gets in the way. He explains how the fire started and fears that he is no longer welcome. He tells Sir Murgatroyd he will leave on the next train. Since his bed is ruined, he tries to sleep on a couch in the library. Annabelle and her parents enter the library. Mordred, who is not wearing slippers, is too modest to reveal his presence in front of Annabelle with bare feet. He hears their conversation and learns that they wanted him to burn the house down. They hoped to stop losing money on it and collect insurance money. Sir Murgatroyd hates the six young men for putting the fire out. Annabelle confesses that she fell in love with Mordred in the dentist's waiting room and will not marry anyone else. This is too much for Mordred and he suddenly reveals his presence, surprising them. He gets engaged to Annabelle, and suggests that they use paraffin to start another fire. They will claim that the previous fire had not been extinguished completely. Annabelle proposes using paper and shavings too. Mordred finds his slippers and they go hand-in- hand to get the materials. Style Wodehouse's stories use vivid imagery which involves similes and metaphors that draw from a wide range of literary and cultural sources. These comparisons seem to be highly incongruous at first glance, yet are appropriate to the particular situation. For example, the Crumpet describes the beautiful but stern Drusilla in \\"Noblesse Oblige\\": \\"I received the impression of a sort of blend of Tallulah Bankhead and a policewoman\\". Also, in \\"The Amazing Hat Mystery\\", the Crumpet states the following: \\"Talking to Elizabeth Bottsworth had always been like bellowing down a well in the hope of attracting the attention of one of the lesser infusoria at the bottom\\".Hall (1974), pp. 106–107. A third example can be seen in \\"The Luck of the Stiffhams\\", when Lord Wivelscombe is experiencing a hangover: \\"He was in an overwrought state when a fly treading a little too heavily on the carpet is enough to make a man think he's one of the extras in All Quiet On The Western Front\\".Hall (1974), pp. 106–108. In Wodehouse's stories, syntactic and lexical ambiguities often result in misunderstandings between characters that lead to comic interactions. This occurs in \\"The Amazing Hat Mystery\\", when Percy interprets Nelson's use of the word \\"abroad\\" as meaning \\"in foreign parts\\", rather than \\"in the land\\": > \\"There is lawlessness and licence abroad.\\" > \\"And here in England too.\\" > \\"Well, naturally, you silly ass,\\" said Nelson, with some asperity. \\"When I > said abroad, I didn't mean abroad, I meant abroad\\".Hall (1974), pp. 87–88. Parallel constructions are sometimes used in Wodehouse's stories, resulting in comic incongruous contradictions. An example of this occurs in \\"The Luck of the Stiffhams\\" (when Wivelscombe tells Geraldine he has seen a ghost): > \\"You look as if you had seen a ghost.\\" > \\"I have seen a ghost.\\" > \\"The White Lady of Wivelscombe?\\" > \\"No, the Pink Secretary of Wivelscombe.\\"Hall (1974), p. 86. One of the stylistic devices used in Wodehouse's stories to create humour is the pun. A pun plays a large role in \\"Noblesse Oblige\\", as the story depends on the similarity in pronunciation between the French mille and the English meal, as shown in the following quote from the story: > \\"But you said you had to have a mille.\\" > \\"And a meal is just what I am going to have,\\" replied the chap, > enthusiastically.Hall (1974), pp. 96–97. Some of Wodehouse's characters have names that give humorous effects in pronunciation, one example being Freddie Widgeon's uncle Lord Blicester (pronounced \\"blister\\"), who first appears in \\"Noblesse Oblige\\".Hall (1974), p. 102.

The Lindholm \\"amulet\\", listed as DR 261 in Rundata, is a bone piece, carved into the shape of a rib, dated to the 2nd to 4th centuries (the late Roman Iron Age) and has a runic inscription. The Lindholm bone piece is dated between 375CE to 570CE and it is around 17 centimeters long at its longest points. It currently resides at Lund University Historical Museum in Sweden. It was found in 1840 in Skåne, Sweden, while cutting peat from a bog. This cut the bone in half and resulted in the destruction of one rune in the second line of text though most of the artifact remained intact. These runic objects were offered to the water in the bogs, the same is probably true in other regions in lakes and streams, but these objects are more difficult to retrieve. Bogs provide near perfect preservation for these types of artifacts thanks to the static, murky waters allowing them to rest undisturbed and unreachable for thousands of years.  Inscription  The inscription reads : : :ekerilazsa[w]ilagazhateka: :aaaaaaaazzznn[n]bmuttt:alu:Project Samnordisk Runtextdatabas Svensk – Rundata. The first line is transcribed into Proto-Norse as either Ek erilaz sa Wilagaz haite'ka or Ek erilaz Sawilagaz haite'ka. This translates to \\"I am (an) erilaz, I am called the wily\\" (or \\"I am called Sawilagaz\\"). If the word in first line is translated as a name, Sawilagaz means \\"the one of the Sun (Sowilo)\\". If the word is translated as \\"the wily\\" or \\"crafty one\\" or \\"deceitful one\\", then it may be related to a byname of Odin or another god. The sequence in the second line contains a \\"magical\\" string of runes concluding in alu. The three consecutive Tiwaz runes as an invocation of the god Tiwaz, and the eight Ansuz runes as an invocation or symbolic list of eight gods. = Interpretation = It is partially due to the formula of the inscription itself which references the way Odin often used to characterize himself as Grimnismal. The word 'erilaR' is frequently found in runic writing as a way to self identify the person carving the rune. The inscription may also be interpreted as “I ‘the eril’ the one who knows magic”. The reason for the rune inscriber to describe himself as crafty or tricky is most likely because he is about to enter a situation in which he will be in need of these qualities in order to be victorious. This gives us some insight into the purpose of the Lindholm amulet and other such historic rune artifacts. The interpretation of the Lindholm amulet is very loose, scholars and archaeologists alike have tried their best to decipher its strange inscriptions but it is likely that the writer either had less logical uses for the inscriptions than conveying a clear message or was not completely literate in the runic alphabet as was often the case with anyone who was not a spiritual leader or a person of great power. = Alphabet = The writing is of the specific runic alphabet is known as Elder Futhark and is the oldest form of runic writing and was often used by both germanic and northwest germanic tribes to inscribe weapons, amulets and instruments of magic. Elder Futhark was for example used for the Proto-Norse language. Runic writing was ideal for inscribing into wood or bone because it was composed primarily of vertical and diagonal lines, always going against the grain. The word rune itself means to carve or cut into. Because of the simplicity of the runic alphabet it is less likely that the amulet itself underwent any sort of erosion capable of obscuring or otherwise making the inscriptions illegible during its time in the bog or during its unearthing. The runic alphabet on the surface is nothing more than a simple code for communication and recording. It is very difficult to know for sure the intended purpose of these runic inscriptions; many believe they have religious, spiritual or even magical connotations. Many believe the runic alphabets sole purpose to be for magical uses. The Lindholm bone piece has a seemingly meaningless inscription carved into its surface and for this reason it is often considered to be a prime example of rune magic used perhaps to assist a warrior in battle or even to help bring prosperity to a poor beggar. It is very probable that this specific artifact was an amulet used for magic purposes, to summon the power of some deity. This is shown by the inscription itself, instead of reading logically, it repeats, a row of *ansuR could be read as a repetition of calling on a deity eight times as one would do in a magical ritual. That being said, it is important to keep in mind that the runic alphabet was used for many things outside of magical incantations and ritualistic devices.  Similarity to the Kragehul spear shaft  The Kragehul spear shaft (which was also found in a bog) and the Lindholm amulet are said to have extremely similar inscriptions. This may be due to the fact that it is fairly common in rune writing to follow the formula of “I so-and-so” when engraving an object with runic inscriptions.

In the later years there also featured a number of 'Sex Issues', asking for responses from hetero and gay people of both sexes. Another frequent feature for a number of years was the back page advice column from Karen Krizanovich, an American journalist who would generally belittle advice seekers, helping them to solve their own problems. From the mid-1990s, cover stars were in the great majority female, and of a more scantily clad appearance than previously.

It was first broadcast 34 years after the first episode of The Two Ronnies was aired and 18 years after the final episode aired. The show came about following the BBC's broadcast of Ronnie Barker: A Bafta Tribute in February 2004, a show which gained a large audience (7.2 million), demonstrating interest remained in Barker's work in comedy. The BAFTA lifetime achievement award was presented to Barker by Ronnie Corbett. The chemistry between the two men was shown to still exist. Six hour-long episodes of The Two Ronnies Sketchbook aired on BBC One in March and April 2005. It saw the Two Ronnies return behind their news desk, introducing some of their favourite sketches and re-reading some of the comic news items that began and ended every episode of The Two Ronnies. Much was made of the fact that the sketches chosen were shown in their entirety. Each week an episode of the Spike Milligan-scripted serial The Phantom Raspberry Blower of Old London Town was shown, and each episode featured a new performance by a popular singer. The sketches chosen were considered true classics - the short-sighted optician, 'Your nuts, m'lord', the Mastermind spoof (Specialist subject: Answering the Question Before Last), and, the sketch voted the nation's favourite, Four Candles (this last sketch until the very end of the sixth episode, pretending they had forgotten about it). The newly recorded introductions provided an opportunity for plenty of good-humoured banter between the pair. The show was met with approval from audiences - 7.9 million tuning in for the opening episode, with many of them too young to have seen The Two Ronnies when it was first broadcast. Ronnie Corbett later said that Ronnie Barker was \\"delighted that the Two Ronnies Sketchbook had gone so well, bringing us to a new generation of audiences\\". This would end up being Barker's final television work. He appeared frail and had lost a lot of weight, and it later became clear that he had been very unwell with a heart condition whilst filming the show. However, he was determined to record one final Christmas special of The Two Ronnies, and so, on 5 July 2005, The Two Ronnies Christmas Sketchbook was recorded. It was broadcast on Christmas Day of the same year, two months after Barker's death (Ronnie Corbett paid tribute to him in a specially recorded introduction to the show), and saw the pair introduce their favourite sketches from their Christmas shows. Again, the show was a rousing success, and - with 7.93 million viewers - was the fourth most watched programme on Christmas Day. Repeat broadcasts The full series of The Two Ronnies Sketchbook was repeated on GOLD daily in Autumn 2007 but was edited to a 30-minute time slot, therefore the show was broadcast in 12 episodes consecutively instead of six sixty-minute shows. Since then the full series was not repeated but The Two Ronnies Christmas Sketchbook has since been repeated over the festive period on both GOLD and BBC One. In December 2011, BBC One repeated some episodes of the series again but only in the 30 minute format. On 23 December 2011, BBC One repeated a full sixty minute episode of The Two Ronnies Sketchbook for the first time since 2005. On 2, 3 and 4 January 2013 BBC One again repeated three thirty minutes edited episodes of the show. Repeats of the show have since began broadcasting on GOLD from 1 November 2013. Repeat broadcastings of the 30 minute edits aired again in December 2014 on BBC One on Friday nights in the 7:30pm slot. GOLD regularly repeat the series and have recently been showing episodes cut down to 45 minutes, to allow adverts. Episode 3 was repeated on BBC One in thirty minute form on 1 April 2016, after the death of Ronnie Corbett.

The siege lasted between 19 April 1848, when a rebellion in the city against a ruler imposed by the East India Company precipitated the Second Anglo-Sikh War, and 22 January 1849, when the last defenders surrendered. Background Sheikh Imam-ud-din, governor of Kashmir under the Sikh Empire, fought on the side of the British during the Siege of Multan Multan had been captured and incorporated into the Sikh Empire of Ranjit Singh in 1818. In 1845, although the population was almost half Muslim, it was ruled by a Hindu vassal, Dewan Mulraj. In that year, the First Anglo-Sikh War broke out, and was won by the British East India Company. There was an uneasy peace for three years, during which Mulraj attempted to maintain practical independence while being nominally subject to the East India Company. In 1848, Multan had a population of 80,000. It was the centre of trade for a wide region, and was renowned for its wealth. There were large stores of spices, silks and valuables. Early in 1848, the newly appointed Commissioner in the Punjab, Sir Frederick Currie, demanded that Mulraj pay duties and taxes previously paid to the central Durbar of the Sikh Empire and now in arrears. Mulraj attempted to forestall a complete annexation of Multan by abdicating in favour of his son. Currie nevertheless decided to impose a compliant Sikh ruler, Sardar Khan Singh, who was to be accompanied by a British Political Agent, Patrick Vans Agnew. The revolt in Multan On 18 April, Vans Agnew and another officer, Lieutenant Anderson from the East India Company's Bombay Army, arrived outside Multan with a small escort of Gurkhas. The next day, Mulraj conducted Khan Singh and the two British officers to the citadel and handed over the keys, with no sign of hostility. As the two officers began to ride out of the citadel, a soldier from Mulraj's army attacked Vans Agnew. This may have been the sign for a concerted attack, as a mob surrounded and attacked them. Mulraj's troops either stood by, or joined the mob. Both officers were wounded, and they and Khan Singh retired to a Mosque outside the city, where Anderson wrote a plea for help. A despatch rider carried it to Currie in Lahore, while a second took a copy via a different route, across the Indus River. During the night, most of Vans Agnew's escort left. Next morning, the mob pushed Khan Singh aside and hacked the two British officers to death. Mulraj had probably not been a party to the conspiracy among his own troops. He nevertheless regarded himself as committed to rebellion by their actions. He presented Vans Agnew's head to Khan Singh and told him to take it back to Currie. The Battle of Kineyri The British Political Agent in Bannu, Lieutenant Herbert Edwardes, took the first steps to suppress Mulraj's revolt. He intercepted the second copy of Vans Agnew's letter to Currie, and immediately began to concentrate troops. He, and other junior British officers were to be frustrated by Currie in Lahore, who proposed to do nothing during the Hot Weather and Monsoon seasons. This was partly for reasons of economy and lack of preparation, but he was supported by the Governor General of Bengal, Lord Dalhousie and the Commander-in-Chief of the Bengal Army, Sir Hugh Gough, who did not wish to expose European troops to a campaign during the harsh weather. Meanwhile, Mulraj was reinforced by several other regiments of the Sikh Khalsa Army, the army of the Sikh empire, which rebelled or deserted. He also took other measures to strengthen his defences, digging up guns which had previously been buried and enlisting more troops. In early June, Edwardes began to lead an army against Multan. On 18 June, his leading troops (Pashtun irregulars) crossed the Chenab River on a ferry boat. They were engaged by Mulraj's artillery and forced to take cover for several hours. Mulraj's infantry and cavalry began to advance but Edwardes was reinforced by two regiments of the Sikh Khalsa Army under Colonel Van Cortlandt, an Anglo-Indian soldier of fortune. Van Cortlandt's artillery caused heavy losses among the Multani troops and Edwardes's Pashtuns counter- attacked. Mulraj's forces retreated to Multan, having suffered 500 casualties and lost six guns. Sher Singh's defection Once Currie learned of this victory, he at last ordered a comparatively small force from the East India Company's Bengal Army under General Whish to begin the siege of Multan. As it was too small to encircle the city, Currie decided to reinforce them and Edwardes with a substantial detachment of the Khalsa under Sher Singh Attariwalla. The appointment of Sher Singh alarmed many junior Political Agents, as his father, Chattar Singh Attariwalla, was apparently openly preparing to revolt in Hazara to the north of the Punjab. Despite warnings, Currie nevertheless ordered a detachment from Chattar Singh's army under his second in command, Jundial Singh, to reinforce Sher Singh. This allowed Jundial Singh and other officers to influence Sher Singh and spread disaffection among his regiments. At this stage the besiegers consisted of Whish's division (8,089 men, 32 siege guns, 12 horse artillery guns), Edwardes's irregulars (4,033 cavalry and 7,718 infantry), a contingent from the Moslem state of Bahawalpur (1,900 cavalry and 5,700 infantry) and Sher Singh's force (3,382 cavalry and 909 infantry). On 14 September, Sher Singh openly rebelled against the East India Company. This left the East India Company's forces too weak to maintain the siege, and they were forced to retreat. Most of Edwardes's troops and the Bahawalpur troops dispersed to their homes. Sher Singh and Mulraj nevertheless were not prepared to cooperate. At a meeting at a neutral mosque outside the city, it was agreed that Sher Singh would move north into the mainly Sikh-populated areas of the Punjab. The Siege Sikh arms and colors used during the siege Late in November, Whish was reinforced by a substantial force from the East India Company's Bombay Army. Some observers claimed that the sepoys of the Bombay contingent, being of generally lower caste than those of the Bengal Army, were more willing and skilled at comparatively menial tasks such as digging trenches. Whish's combined force amounted to 32,000, of which 15,000 were from the British Army or European (mainly Irish) troops of the Bengal and Bombay armies. He also had 150 pieces of artillery, many of which were heavy guns or mortars. It was comparatively easy to supply this large force, as Multan lay near the Indus River, and steamships could bring supplies some way up the river and to within a short distance of the city. Inside the city, Mulraj commanded 12,000 troops, with 54 guns and 12 mortars. (Some sources state that 80 guns were mounted in the citadel, though some of these may have been obsolete or decorative pieces). On 27 December, Whish ordered four columns of troops to attack the suburbs. Mulraj's forces were driven back into the city, and Whish's force set up batteries 500 yards from the city walls. Under cover of their fire, breaching batteries were set up only 80 yards from the walls, and created two breaches in them while causing great damage in the city. On 30 December, the main magazine in the citadel exploded, killing 800 of the defenders. It was a mosque in which 180 tonnes of gunpowder were stored. A British mortar shell hit it. It is considered one of the largest non-nuclear explosions in history. Mulraj nevertheless maintained his fire and sent a defiant message to Whish, stating that he still had enough powder to last a year. He attempted to mount a sortie against the besiegers on 31 December but this was driven back. Whish ordered a general assault on 2 January 1849. The attackers successfully scaled the breaches, and the battle became a bloody house-to-house fight in the city, in which many defenders and civilians were killed indiscriminately. Whish ordered the civilians to be herded into the main square; he may have intended to spare them from further fighting but the action of corralling them was also accompanied by further casualties. With the fall of the city, only the already-scarred citadel remained, but it held out for another fortnight against heavy bombardment. On 18 January, Whish's sappers exploded three mines under its walls, causing heavy losses and destroying large sections of its walls. Mulraj offered to surrender if his life was spared, but Whish insisted on unconditional surrender, and on 22 January, Mulraj gave himself up, with 550 men. Aftermath Corporal John Ryder of the (European) Bombay Fusiliers later wrote of the city after the siege, The British gained vast quantities of loot. Mulraj's treasury was worth three million pounds, a huge sum for the time. There was also much looting in the town, by both British and Indian soldiers. With the fall of Multan, Whish's army was able to reinforce the main Bengal Army force under Sir Hugh Gough. Whish's heavy guns were decisive at the Battle of Gujarat, which effectively broke Sher Singh's and Chattar Singh's armies and ended the war. Mulraj was placed on trial for the murders of Vans Agnew and Anderson. He was cleared of premeditated murder, but was found guilty of being an accessory after the fact, in that he had rewarded the murderers and openly used the deaths as pretext for rebellion. (Under British law at the time, an \\"accessory after the fact\\" of a crime was liable to the same punishment as the criminal.) Mulraj was sentenced to death, but the sentence was later commuted to exile for life. In August 1849, the Indus and Chenab rivers overflowed, and the heavily damaged citadel was washed away, eventually resembling an \\"island of mud\\" amidst the floods.

The sequence alu () is found in numerous Elder Futhark runic inscriptions of Germanic Iron Age Scandinavia (and more rarely in early Anglo-Saxon England) between the 3rd and the 8th century. The word usually appears either alone (such as on the Elgesem runestone) or as part of an apparent formula (such as on the Lindholm \\"amulet\\" (DR 261) from Scania, Sweden). The symbols represent the runes Ansuz, Laguz, and Uruz. The origin and meaning of the word are matters of dispute, though a general agreement exists among scholars that the word represents an instance of historical runic magic or is a metaphor (or metonym) for it.Macleod (2006:24). It is the most common of the early runic charm words.Macleod (2006:1009) The word disappears from runic inscriptions shortly after the Migration Period, even before the Christianization of Scandinavia.Macleod (2006:100-101). It may have lived on beyond this period with an increasing association with ale, appearing in stanzas 7 and 19 of the Old Norse poem Sigrdrífumál, compiled in the 13th century Poetic Edda, where knowledge of invocative \\"ale runes\\" (Old Norse ölrúnar) is imparted by the Valkyrie Sigrdrífa.Orchard (1997:5). Theories have been suggested that the unique term ealuscerwen (possibly \\"pouring away of alu\\"), used to describe grief or terror in the epic poem Beowulf, recorded around the 9th to 11th century, may be directly related. Etymology Although the literal meaning of the word alu is generally accepted to be \\"ale,\\" i.e. \\"intoxicating beverage,\\" researchers have found it necessary to look deeper into the significance of the term. Earlier proposed etymologies for the word sought a connection with Proto-Germanic *' \\"amulet, taboo\\" from *'alh \\"protect.\\"Simek (1995:16-17). Cognates in Germanic dialects would include Old English ealh \\"temple,\\" Gothic alhs \\"temple,\\" and Old Norse alh \\"amulet.\\"Fick (1909:21). Edgar Polomé initially proposed an etymological connection between Germanic alu and Hittite \\"affected by witchcraft,\\" which is in turn connected to Greek alúõ \\"to be beside oneself\\" and Latvian aluôt \\"to be distraught.\\" This etymology was later proven faulty and subsequently dropped by Polomé, though he continues to suggest that a common semantic denominator connects these words with alu.Polomé (1995:244-264). Linguistic connections have been proposed between the term and the Proto-Germanic term *aluþ, meaning \\"ale,\\" and subsequently the word is sometimes translated as meaning \\"ale,\\"Flowers (2006:75).Runic text according to Projektet Samnordisk Runtextdatabas - Rundata for Windows 2.0. though this linguistic approach has been criticized as having \\"crucial difficulties.\\" Polomé takes the word to belong to the \\"technical operative vocabulary\\" of the Germanic peoples, originally referring to \\"an ecstatic mental state as transferred to a potent drink\\" used in religious rituals in Germanic paganism. Raetian North Etruscan dedicatory votive objects have been discovered featuring alu where the term means \\"dedication\\". Connections have been proposed between these objects and the term alu found on runic inscriptions. Theories have been proposed that the term was loaned into Runic usage from this source. Inscriptions =Bracteates= The inscription alu appears on the following bracteates: G 205, DR BR6, DR BR13, DR BR25, DR BR42, DR BR54, DR BR59, DR BR63A, DR BR67, DR EM85;123, and DR NOR2002;10. G 205 Bracteate G 205 bearing the inscription Alu. A gold bracteate (G 205) discovered in Djupbrunns, Hogrän, Sweden reads simply Alu and dates from around 400 CE. The bracteate was discovered in the same location as another gold bracteate (G 204) from a considerably younger date that features the inscription ek erilaR. Today the bracteate is located in Swedish History Museum, Stockholm, Sweden. DR BR6 A fragment of a bracteate (DR BR6) discovered in Skrydstrup, South Jutland, Denmark bears the term Alu. The transliteration reads: :lauk=az alu lauk=az alu Which transcribed into Proto-Norse is: :Laukaz alu. Laukaz alu. The fragment dates from around 400 to 650 CE. Today the bracteate is housed in the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen, Denmark. DR BR42 The Funen bracteate (DR BR42). A bracteate discovered on the island of Funen, Denmark features incomprehensible and meaningful text. The bracteate is housed with many others at the National Museum of Denmark. The transcription reads: :houaz laþu aaduaaaliia a-- : What is transcribed as a-- above has been tentatively read as alu. The word houaz has been interpreted as corresponding to Old Norse hávi \\"the high one\\", a name of Odin.According to the objects display at the National Museum of Denmark, Copenhagen, Denmark. DR NOR2002;10 The Uppåkra bracteate (DR NOR2002;10), a C-bracteate found in Uppåkra, Scania, Sweden during a search with a metal detector in 2000. The bracteate bears a Proto-Norse runic inscription. The transliteration reads: :sima-ina alu The bracteate depicts a man's head over a four-legged animal. The A inscription (first part, sima-ina) is placed over the back part of the head, while the B inscription (second part, alu) is placed over the animal's front legs. The inscription seems to belong to the big group of C-bracteates with more or less comprehensible charm words. New finds from Denmark and Skåne. Uppåkra runebrakteat. Linked from Rundata. =Runestones= Eggja stone The Elgesem runestone. The third panel Elder Futhark inscriptions found on the 7th or 8th CE century Eggja stone discovered on the farm Eggja located in Sogn og Fjordane, Norway is often interpreted as reading alu. Elgesem runestone An inscription reading simply \\"alu\\" is found on a stone discovered in a grave mound located by the farm of Elgesem, Vestfold, Norway, in 1870.Looijenga (2003:194).Page (2005:30). The Elgesem runestone, listed in the Rundata catalog as N KJ57 U, is dated to about 400 CE. The stone is 172 centimeters tall and 90 centimeters wide, and the thickness is about 18 centimeters. The inscription is written counter-clockwise and is to be read from the top downwards.Aschehoug og Gyldendals (2005:438). As the stone has been purposefully shaped, it has been suggested that the Elgesem runestone was a cult stone used as part of some ritual.Antonsen (1988:50-53). It has also been suggested that similar shaped cult stones are depicted on the Stora Hammars I, Ardre VIII and Tängelgårda IV image stones. Eketorp slate fragment The Eketorp slate fragment (Öl ACTARC37;211 U) is a runestone that was found in Eketorp, Sweden and features an Elder Futhark inscription in Proto-Norse. The first line of the inscription reads: :... alu k... The second line of the inscription reads: :...gþutþ... Kinneve stone The Kinneve stone (Vg 134) is a stone fragment (measures 7,4 x 5,0 x 2,0 cm) Västra Götalands Runstenar of red soapstone dated to around 600 CE. It was found by chaplain John Lagerblom in 1843 in a grave on the area of the rectory (Prästgården) of Kinneve socken, Sweden. The stone is today housed in the collection of the Västergötland museum, Skara, Sweden. The inscription has been read as: :...siz alu h siz (siR \\\\- the last rune is the *Algiz rune) has by Y. Kodratoff been interpreted as the end of a name, and according to Kodratoff the h can represent the *Haglaz rune. Since the fragment was found in a grave, the inscription has been theorized as potentially related to a death cult or \\"mortuary magic.\\"Runic Inscriptions by Yves Kodratoff. Årstad stone The Årstad stone (N KJ58) is a runestone found in 1855 on the Årstad farm in Rogaland, Norway. It bears 18-20 runes of the Elder Futhark on three lines. The second line reads saralu,Antonsen (2002:223). which is by some scholars split into the words sar and alu.According to Runenprojekt Kiel's entry on interpretations to the Årstad inscription. Today the stone is housed in the Antiquities Collection at the Museum of Cultural History in Oslo. Entry on Årstad-steinen in Aschehoug og Gyldendals Store norske leksikon, 4th edition, 2005-07. Retrieved at 01.06.2008. =Other= The inscription alu appears on the following objects: Nydam Mose =Nydam Arrow= The Nydam Arrow (DR 13) is an arrow discovered in Nydam Mose, South Jutland, Denmark that bears the inscription lua which has been interpreted as a distorted alu.Knirk (2002:644) It is dated to around 200 to 350 CE. Today the arrow is housed in Museum für Vorgeschichtliche Altertümer in Kiel, Germany. =Nydam arrow shafts= The Nydam arrow shafts (DR MS1995;344 and DR AUD1994;266) are two arrow shafts discovered in Nydam Mose, South Jutland, Denmark that bear the inscriptions la and lua respectively. They have both been interpreted as alu, but it is not certain. The arrow shafts are dated to around 300 to 350 CE. Today they are housed at the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen. =Nydam axe shaft= The Nydam axe shaft (DR MS1995;341) is a wooden axe shaft discovered in Nydam Mose, South Jutland, Denmark that bears a runic inscription. It is dated to around 300 to 350 CE. Today it is housed at the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen. Værløse Fibula Detail of the inscription on the Værløse Fibula reading alugod followed by a swastika. A 3rd century silver fibula (DR EM85;123) from Værløse, Zealand, Denmark features a runic inscription on its pinholder that simply reads \\"alugod\\" followed by a swastika. The Værløse Fibula is housed at the National Museum of Denmark. Lindholm \\"amulet\\" The Lindholm \\"amulet\\" (DR 261) is a bone piece found in Skåne, dated to the 2nd to 4th centuries. The inscription contains the word alu. Cremation urns Three 5th century cremation urns from Spong Hill, Norfolk, England bear the impression of the term alu by \\"the same runic stamp\\" in mirror- runes.Hines (2002:189). Setre Comb The Setre Comb is a comb from the 6th or early 7th century featuring runic inscriptions. The comb is the subject of an amount of scholarly discourse as most experts accept the reading of the Germanic charm word alu and Nanna, though there exists questions as to if Nanna is the same figure as the goddess from later attestations.

They are referred to as \\"fragments\\" because they do not exist in one unified manuscript but have been reassembled from sheets used as book-binding material in later centuries. These old materials had themselves at some stage been bundled together into several collections of flyleaves and saved in various books which had historical connections with Worcester. Once it was recognised that these scattered fragments came from the same source it was possible to piece them together, though much remained missing. The pieces are from the late 13th century to early 14th century. None of them is longer than five minutes, with some as short as one minute long. They demonstrate a variety of musical forms from the period, including the conductus and motet. Parts of several polyphonic compositions attributed to Willelmus de Winchecumbe are included in the Worcester Fragments. 15 original leaves of the Worcester Fragments were recovered from late-medieval bindings of Worcester Cathedral Priory and are now at the Bodleian Library in Oxford.MS.

First published in 1971, the book was a Newbery Honor book for 1972.Newbery Medal and Honor Books, 1922-Present Plot After his university professor father remarries, eleven-year-old David Stanley must make a series of new adjustments: first to his new stepmother, then to the strange old house in the country to which the family relocates, and finally to his new stepsister, twelve-year-old Amanda. Amanda is upset about her mother's divorce and remarriage, and about being forced to move away from the city and her best friend there. Amanda claims to be a practicing witch, and arrives at the Stanley home in a ceremonial costume, bringing books on the supernatural and a caged crow that she claims is her familiar. She offers to share her occult knowledge with David and his younger siblings Janie, Tesser, and Blair. David, while skeptical, goes along with the idea in order to get along with Amanda and protect his younger siblings. In contrast to Amanda's possibly staged \\"witchcraft\\", the Stanley children, particularly David and Blair, seem to have some actual psychic gifts, but do not talk about them. The Stanleys' old house has an alleged past history of being inhabited by a destructive poltergeist, who caused rocks to fly through the house and beheaded a wooden cupid that is carved into the stairs. When David's father is away, the poltergeist suddenly becomes active and again begins to wreak havoc in the house. David suspects Amanda of causing the events, and he and Blair eventually catch her in the act. However, one night a box of rocks, along with the long-lost cupid's head, suddenly falls down the stairs, in an incident not caused by Amanda. A shaken Amanda confesses to having faked the previous poltergeist events and her other supposed occult encounters, and gives up her witchcraft. As David glues the cupid's head back on, he learns that four-year-old Blair dropped the box down the stairs. According to Blair, a ghost girl told him where to find the box containing the rocks and cupid's head, but he tripped carrying the heavy box and spilled out its contents. Blair does not remember anything else about the encounter, leaving David to wonder whether supernatural beings may be living in the Stanley home.

It is most common in the Midwestern prairies. Little bluestem is a perennial bunchgrass and is prominent in tallgrass prairie, along with big bluestem (Andropogon gerardi), indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). It is a warm-season species, meaning it employs the C4 photosynthetic pathway. Description Little bluestem grows to become an upright, roundish mound of soft, bluish-green or grayish-green blades in May and June that is about two to three feet high. In July, it initiates flowering stalks, which reach four to five feet in height. In fall, it displays a coppery or mostly orange color with tints of red or purple. Sometimes it displays in some places, as in sandy soils, a redder fall color. It becomes a more orangish-bronze in winter until early spring, when it becomes more tan. Cultivation It is recommended for USDA zones 3 to 10. The plant grows best in full sun and on well-drained soils. It can be dug up and divided in spring, as many other perennials, for propagation or to reduce the size of an old, big plant. It can be burned in late winter or early spring in a prairie or meadow before new growth, like many American prairie grasses (big blues team, Indian-grass, and switchgrass), which burn quickly and cleanly. =Cultivars= A number of cultivars have been developed. 'Carousel' is a compact form with especially good fall color developed by Chicagoland Grows. 'The Blues' is a selection that has bluer foliage. 'Standing Ovation' is a tight, upright form with bluer and thicker blades and sturdier stems. Subdivisions One variety, var. littorale, is native to the eastern and southern coastal strip of the United States, as well as the shores of the Great Lakes. It is adapted to sand dune habitat, and is sometimes considered a separate species, S. littorale. Culture Little bluestem is the official state grass of Nebraska and Kansas. Ecology Little bluestem is drought tolerant, and is a larval host to the cobweb skipper, common wood nymph, crossline skipper, Dakota skipper, dusted skipper, Indian skipper, Leonard's skipper, Ottoe skipper, and swarthy skipper.The Xerces Society (2016), Gardening for Butterflies: How You Can Attract and Protect Beautiful, Beneficial Insects, Timber Press.

The Šventoji River flows through the town. In 1956 near Kavarskas a water lifting station was built and part of the Šventoji River's water was channeled to the Nevėžis River. Nowadays there is a water-power plant operating there. History In place of the modern town, in the 15th century there was the Mažieji Pienionys (Little Pienionys) estate. At the end of 15th century Grand Duke of Lithuania Alexander Jagiellon transferred the estate to Stanislovas Kovarskis, the treasurer of the king. As he had no successors, the estate was inherited by his brother, Andrius Kovarskis, the canon of the Vilnius Cathedral. Thus the name of the Little Pienionys estate was changed to Kavarskas. In written sources Kavarskas was first mentioned in 1538. In that year a church was built. In the 16th century, Kavarskas and the surrounding area belonged to nobles Astikai, later – Ogiński (Oginskiai), Tyszkiewicz (Tiškevičiai), and Siesickiai.

It was the first service comedy based on the peacetime draft of 1940. The comedy team made two more service comedies before the United States entered the war (In the Navy and Keep 'Em Flying). A sequel to this movie, Buck Privates Come Home, was released in 1947. Buck Privates is one of three Abbott and Costello films featuring The Andrews Sisters, who were also under contract to Universal Pictures at the time. Abbott and Costello performed a radio adaptation of the film on the Lux Radio Theater on October 13, 1941. Plot Slicker Smith and Herbie Brown (Abbott and Costello) are sidewalk peddlers who hawk neckties out of a suitcase. They are chased by a cop (Nat Pendleton) and duck into a movie theater, not realizing that it is now being used as an Army enlistment center. Believing that they are signing up for theater prizes, they end up enlisting instead. Meanwhile, spoiled playboy Randolph Parker (Lee Bowman) and his long- suffering valet, Bob Martin (Alan Curtis), also enlist at the theater. Randolph expects his influential father to pull some strings so he can avoid military service. Bob, on the other hand, takes his military obligations in stride. Tensions between the two men escalate further with the introduction of Judy Gray (Jane Frazee), a camp hostess and friend of Bob's upon whom Randolph sets his sights. At boot camp, Slicker and Herbie are mortified to discover that Collins, the policeman who chased them, is now their drill instructor. Randolph, meanwhile, learns that his father will not use his influence on his behalf, believing that a year in the Army will do Randolph some good. For all the difficulties, life at camp turns out not to so bad, since The Andrews Sisters appear at regular intervals to sing patriotic or sentimental tunes (including \\"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy\\") and Herbie continues to foul up with little consequence. Although he is an expert marksman, Randolph skips an army shooting match in order to spend the afternoon with Judy. The company loses the match and a sizeable amount of money they had bet, causing them to resent him even more. However, during a war game exercise, Randolph redeems himself by saving Bob and coming up with a ruse to win the sham battle for his company. He is finally accepted by his unit and wins Bob's and Judy's admiration in the process. He learns that he's been accepted to Officer Training School but initially refuses, believing that his father's political influence was responsible. However, his commanding officer assures him that his training record (along with recommendations from his company) factored in the decision. Bob has also been offered an appointment to OTS, and Judy announces that she will be joining them as a hostess at the training facility. Meanwhile, Smitty and Herbie eagerly accept an invitation to shoot dice with Collins, but Herbie ends up losing his pants.

It was originally budgeted at $233,000 over 20 days; in the end it was $12,000 over budget and four days over schedule. The famous \\"drill routine\\", where Smitty tries to get Herbie and other soldiers to march in formation, was actually a series of shorter takes that were strung together to expand the bit to more than three minutes of screen time. Abbott and Costello had been performing this sketch on stage for more than three years.Palumbo, Ron. \\"Buck Privates: The Complete Filmscript.\\" Bear Manor Media, 2013. Lubin recalled the film \\"was very strange to shoot because they didn't go by much of a shooting script. Being burlesque comedians they just did their old routines. They would say 'This routine is \\"Spit in the Bush\\".'... And they would have to act it for me and show it what it was. The entire first script was a series of titled gags. I would just say 'We'll take a close up here and a two shot here'. I never interfered. There were was nothing I could do because these were tried and true old burlesque things that they and their forefathers and their forefathers, probably since the Greek period, had done.\\" Reception Lubin recalled \\"\\"the studio was a little uncertain about how they were going to be accepted. But at the first preview the audience just died. Buck Privates was a very, very funny show. And, actually, I must say it was very little credit to the director. It consisted mainly of fabulous gags that these two wonderful guys knew from years and years of being in burlesque.\\" They promptly requsted Lubin make a follow up, Oh, Charlie! which became Hold That Ghost. =Critical= The film received positive reviews from critics. Theodore Strauss of The New York Times called it \\"an hour and a half of uproarious monkeyshines. Army humor isn't apt to be subtle and neither are Abbott and Costello. Their antics have as much innuendo as a 1,000-pound bomb but nearly as much explosive force.\\" Variety wrote, \\"Geared at a zippy pace, and providing lusty and enthusiastic comedy of the broadest slapstick, Buck Privates is a hilarious laugh concoction that will click solidly in the general runs for profitable biz.\\" Film Daily enthused, \\"If ever a 'sleeper' appeared out of Hollywood, this is it ... the attraction is a grand, madcap musical which packs a whale of a wallop for the general public liking laughs galore on the frankly slapstick side.\\" Harrison's Reports called it \\"A good comedy for the masses ... Abbott and Costello definitely establish themselves as a comedy team that should win wide popularity.\\" Diabolique magazine wrote \\"It's become fashionable in later years among Abbott and Costello aficionados to decry Buck Privates – purists complain about all those Andrews Sisters numbers and the time devoted to a \\"straight\\" love triangle. Hold That Ghost (1941) and especially Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948) are more highly regarded by buffs. But I think it's terrific – in part because of that love triangle (which is very well acted) and the Andrews Sisters, but also because Abbott and Costello were rarely so energetic. They're in top form with brilliant routines, and Lubin treats it all with the perfect light touch.\\" Award nominations The film received two Academy Award nominations in 1941. Hughie Prince and Don Raye were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song for Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy and Charles Previn was nominated for an Academy Award for Original Music Score (Scoring of a Musical Picture). The film was one of Universal's biggest money-makers of the year, grossing over $4 million at the box office at a time when movie tickets averaged 25 cents and gross was defined as money earned by the studio; today it refers to all of the money that a film made. Universal gave director Arthur Lubin—who was under contract at a fixed salary—a $5,000 bonus and told him to start on another film, Hold That Ghost, almost immediately. Lubin directed five Abbott and Costello films in ten months. World War II Japan used this film as propaganda to demonstrate to its own troops the \\"incompetence\\" of the United States Army. The film was shown to U.S. troops in every theater of war. Rerelease It was re-released in 1948, and again on a double bill with Keep 'Em Flying in 1953 during the Korean War. Andrews Sisters The Andrews Sisters perform four songs in the film: \\"You're a Lucky Fellow, Mr. Smith\\", \\"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy\\", \\"Bounce Me, Brother, With a Solid Four\\", and \\"(I'll Be With You) In Apple Blossom Time\\". The composers of the first three of these songs, Don Raye and Hughie Prince, appear in the film as new recruits alongside Abbott and Costello. Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy was nominated for an Academy Award. The studio was against using (I'll Be With You) In Apple Blossom Time because of fees demanded by the music publisher. The Andrews Sisters paid the fee themselves, and it went on to become one of their most requested songs. \\"Bounce Me, Brother, With a Solid Four\\" also features one of the more famous Lindy Hop dance sequences of the swing era. Many dancers from Los Angeles, including Dean Collins, Jewel McGowan, Ray Hirsch, and Patty Lacey, are featured. Home media This film was released on VHS and Beta in 1983, then re-released on VHS in 1989 and again in 1991. It has been released three times on DVD, first as single DVD on April 1, 1998 , and later as part of two different Abbott and Costello collections. The first time, on The Best of Abbott and Costello Volume One, on February 10, 2004, and again on October 28, 2008 as part of Abbott and Costello: The Complete Universal Pictures Collection.

In his playing career, Krogh was the first choice goalkeeper of Ikast fS between 1981 and 1991 and of Brøndby from 1991 to his retirement in December 2002, playing 464 first team matches for the latter. Krogh also played 10 matches for the Denmark national football team. He has won both the UEFA European Championship and the FIFA Confederations Cup. Biography Born in Hjørring, Denmark, Krogh started his career at small clubs Horne KFUM and Tårs Ugilt, before playing in the topflight Danish 1st Division for Ikast fS. In 1991, the Danish champions from the two years prior, Brøndby, sold their first choice keeper Peter Schmeichel, and Krogh was bought as a replacement. Brøndby did not initially find the success they sought, though Krogh would prove his worth in the domestic league. In the 1995–96 Danish Superliga (formerly known as 1st Division) season, Brøndby was trailing AGF in the league. In the direct match-up of the two teams late in the season, Brøndby was losing 2–3 when Krogh went into the attack at a corner kick, and headed the ball in goal for the 3–3 result that spurred Brøndby on to make a comeback and win the season title. He won four Danish league titles during his career. On the international scene, Krogh played 66 matches for Brøndby IF, including highlights like the game against CD Tenerife in the 1997 UEFA Cup, when Krogh saved a penalty kick in a game Brøndby won 1–0. One of his best games was the 1998–99 UEFA Champions League match against Bayern Munich which Brøndby won 2–1, and Krogh was subsequently named 1999 Brøndby IF Player of the Year. For the Danish national team, Krogh stood in the shadow of clear first choice keeper Peter Schmeichel, but Krogh was a stable understudy who was selected in the Danish squads for the 1992 European Championship (Euro 1992) and Euro 1996, as well as the 1998 FIFA World Cup without playing a single match. He was one in a trio, also counting Lars Høgh and Peter Kjær, who took turns in being first reserve for Schmeichel. Krogh would, however, shine in the King Fahd Cup 1995, when he came on as a substitute and saved two penalty kicks from Marcelino Bernal and Luis García Postigo in the semi-final against Mexico before playing the 2–0 win in the final against Argentina.

Formative years (1848-1865) The first Episcopal church services held in Fond du Lac were in 1842 by the Rev. Richard Fish Cadle. In 1845 Bishop Jackson Kemper and the Rev. F. R. Haff visited the thriving village of 400 inhabitants, conducting services at the residence of Governor Nathaniel P. Tallmadge. On September 3, 1848, the Rev. Joshua Sweet, the Episcopal priest for the village of Fond du Lac, formally organized St. Paul's Church. The new congregation included some well-known names in the area, such as, Doty, Tallmadge, Ruggles, and McWilliams. These names would be used as street names within the city of Fond du Lac. These Episcopalians first worshiped in a variety of makeshift locations until in 1851 a wood frame building was erected at the corner of Follett and Bannister {Macy} streets. Developing Years (1866-1913) The east end of the cathedral interior In 1866 with the growth of the congregation, it moved to its current location on West Division Street, building a new stone structure. That same year, the process was begun to erect a new diocese from the Fond du Lac Deanery of the Diocese of Wisconsin. By 1870, Fond du Lac had become the second largest city in Wisconsin. The new Diocese of Fond du Lac came to be in 1875 and shortly thereafter its new bishop, Bishop John Henry Hobart Brown declared the city of Fond du Lac and St. Paul's Church as the Episcopal See. It may have been chosen because it was a 'free-church'. In January 1884, the building burned and was replaced by the present structure. From 1889-1912, Bishop Charles Chapman Grafton worked to complete the interior of the building. Early acquisitions were a pulpit (created by local stone carver Robert Powrie), a brass eagle lectern, and the German-Victorian carvings from 1893-1894. The carvings came from Munich and included the twelve Apostles, St. Paul, and twenty-five angels. After Grafton's death, the Very Rev. Bernard Iddings Bell served as its first Dean until 1917 when he was commissioned a chaplain in the U.S. Navy. His institution at St. Paul's was notorious due to his public advocacy of Socialism, though he had quit the party years prior to government investigation in 1920. He wrote frequently for The Living Church and drew national attention for his book Right and Wrong After the War (1918). Chapel of St. Michael the Archangel Grafton's grave in the cathedral It was Bishop Grafton's request that he be buried in the cathedral, so in the year following his death on August 30, 1912, the area known as the Chapel of St. Michael the Archangel was redone. The burial site features a white marble and red porphyry sarcophagus, supporting a life-size figure of the bishop. The chapel became the permanent site of his burial on August 30, 1913.

She was married to Yayati, and gave birth to two sons — Yadu and Turvasu. Before her marriage, she once fell in love with Brihaspati's son, Kacha. However, Kacha later refused to marry her.  Love for Kacha  Kacha was the son of Brihaspati. He was sent by Devas to Sukra's ashram to learn about Mrita Sanjeevani mantra. Shukra accepted him as his student. However, the Danavas didn’t like this. They wanted to kill him. They tried to kill him twice but in both occasions Shukracharya revive him at the request of her daughter Devyani. Devyani was secretly in love with Kacha. Third time Danavas killed him in a different way. They burned his body and the ashes were mixed with liquor and give it to Shukracharya. When Devayani found Kacha missing again , she complained to her father. Sukra got to know that Kacha was in his stomach. He was in a dilemma as if he revives Kacha then Shukra would die. So Sukra taught Kacha sanjeevani mantra. Kacha was revived by piercing Sukra’s stomach and with the mantra revives his teacher. After achieving his goal, Kacha was about to leave the gurukul. Devayani expressed her love and proposed to him. Kacha told that he came out of her father’s womb and hence Sukra becomes his father. So he considered Devyani as a sister. Devayani didn’t buy this line and disappointed she cursed him that the Vidya he had learnt won’t work for him. In turn Kacha cursed her back to marry outside Brahmin family. After the incident they parted their ways and never met again.  Scuffle with Sharmiștha  Sharmishtha was the daughter of Vrisaparva, the Danava king, for whom Shukracharya was an adviser. One day Sharmishtha, daughter of the Danava king Vrishparva and Devayani, daughter of the Daitya sage Shukracharya, go with Sharmishtha's retinue to bathe in a forest pool not far from their home. After bathing, Sharmishtha confuses Devayani's sari with hers and puts it on instead. Devayani returns, scolds Sharmishtha for her mistake and belittles her with the jibe that she is the daughter of Shukracharya (Shukracharya being a sage and high priest and indeed the guru of all the Asuras - no mere employee) as Vrishparva's and their Kingdom lives on his blessings. This slur on herself and her father Vrishparva infuriates Sharmishtha with the help of her servants throws the naked Devayani into a well and leaves the forest with her retinue. Later Yayati, son of Nahusha, comes to the well for water and helps Devayani to climb out of it. When Devyani comes back to her father, she narrates the whole story and demands that Sharmishtha along with other asura girls serve her as maid, which Vrishparva has to agree for he doesn't want to offend Shukracharya.  Marriage  Devayani standing besides Yayati, questions Sharmishtha Some days later Devayani goes to a picnic in the forest along with her Sharmișțha and other servants. There Yayati comes for hunting and they meet again. This time she brings him to her father and tells him that they would like to marry. Shukracharya gives his consent and tells Yayati that he should take care of Sharmista too as she was a princess but shouldn't have nuptial relation with her. Yayati marries Devayani and looks after her well. Yayati sired two sons, Yadu and Thurvasu with Devyani. Unknown to her he was in a relationship with Sharmista and had three sons with her, Dhruhyu, Anu and Puru. When Devayani learns of this she leaves him and returns to her father's place. Shukracharya curses him with premature old age. However, on Yayati's insistence he agrees to reduce the curse on condition that Yayati can swap his old age with the youth of any of his young sons. Yayati swaps his youth with his 5th son Puru. Notes * Devayani and Kacha Retold by P. R. Ramachander External links * Devayani and Yayati Retold by P. R.

Cold-potato routing is the opposite, where the originating autonomous system holds onto the packet until it is as near to the destination as possible. For example, consider the case of two ISP's, A and B, who both have global networks. Additionally, they have peering agreements in both Europe and in Asia, which allows them to exchange data packets destined for the other's network at either location. Now suppose a European customer of ISP A wants to transmit a data packet to an Asian customer of ISP B. ISP A will receive the packet in Europe and has to decide where to send the packet next. The first option is to hand off the packet to ISP B in Europe, and let ISP B carry the packet to Asia to be delivered to its destination. This is called hot-potato routing, since ISP A hands off the packet at the earliest opportunity, as in a game of hot potato. The second option is for ISP A to carry the packet to Asia on its internal network, and hand it off to ISP B there. This is called cold-potato routing by symmetry, since ISP A keeps the packet in its internal network as long as possible.  Hot-potato routing  Hot-potato routing is the normal behavior of most settlement-free peering agreements. Hot-potato routing has the effect that the network receiving the data bears the cost of carrying it between cities. When the traffic ratio (the ratio of traffic flowing in one direction to the traffic flowing in the other direction between peers) is reasonably even, this is considered fair, because the networks will share evenly in carrying traffic exchanged by their customers between cities. The marginal cost of carrying traffic between cities depends on how the network has purchased those links; some networks own dark fiber, which can be upgraded by merely replacing the equipment on each end of the fiber, and possibly the amplifiers along the path between cities. In other cases, the network has an agreement with a telco that allows for a specific amount of bandwidth, and upgrading involves paying more money to the telco.  Cold-potato routing  Cold-potato routing, on the other hand, is more expensive to do, but keeps the traffic under the network administrator's control for longer, allowing operators of well-provisioned networks to offer a higher quality of service to their customers. It can also be preferred when connecting to content providers; if content providers use cold-potato routing, they may escape from paying for the cost of links between cities. Cold-potato routing is prone to misconfiguration as well as poor coordination between two networks. In such scenarios, packets can be routed further distances and can allow another autonomous system to manipulate routing in a network for various purposes. Cold-potato routing requires a level of trust between two networks that either side will not attempt to \\"cheat\\" the other. Some content networks favor the use of cold-potato routing (multi exit discriminator exchange/honoring) in order to deliver content from replicated server farms closer to the end-user.  Route announcement policy  The terms can also be used to describe the route announcement policy of a network: by choosing to announce their network at a large number of points at the periphery of another autonomous system, a provider can pull incoming traffic onto their network as soon as possible, ensuring that the traffic stays on their network all the way to their customer's connection.

Early life Amery was born Moe Amiri (he changed his name sometime between 1989 and 1993) in Lebanon on September 20, 1954, and came to Canada in 1974. He studied at the University of Alberta from 1975 until 1977, after which time he relocated to Calgary to become a realtor until his election to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta in 1993. Provincial Politics =Electoral record= Amery's first two bids for elected office were unsuccessful; he sought provincial election in Calgary-Forest Lawn in the 1986 and 1989 elections, but was defeated both times, finishing second to New Democrat Barry Pashak each time. He was more successful in 1993, when he more than doubled Pashak's vote count in the newly formed Calgary-East. He was handily re-elected in each of the 1997, 2001, 2004, and 2008 elections. =Legislative initiatives= In 1994, Amery introduced two different bills called the Maintenance Enforcement Amendment Act. The first, a private member's bill, would have made it impossible for individuals in arrears on child support payments to register their vehicles or renew their drivers' licenses. The second, a government bill, included the objectives of the first, but also took other measures, including ending a provision by which money held in a joint bank account could not be drawn upon to satisfy child support payments owed by one of the account-holders. The government bill passed with the support of the Progressive Conservatives and some Liberals, including Sine Chadi and Michael Henry. Other Liberals - including Gary Dickson, Debby Carlson, Bettie Hewes, Mike Percy, Percy Wickman, Ken Nicol, Nicholas Taylor, and Colleen Soetaert - opposed the bill on the grounds that it didn't go far enough in taking measures to recover payments, promoted animosity in an already adversarial process, and was written with insufficient consultation with the recently privatized registries centres. After the government bill passed, the private member's bill was ruled redundant by Speaker Stanley Schumacher. Amery has introduced a number of private member's bills designed to extend primary education to include kindergarten, requiring school boards to provide it and making attendance compulsory. The first two of these - both called the School Amendment Act, sponsored in 1995 and 1997 - failed to reach second reading before the legislature adjourned. Amery's third attempt, the School (Early Childhood Services) Amendment Act, was defeated on second reading. Liberals were unanimous in their support of the bill, pointing to similar bills that had previously been sponsored by Liberal MLAs Grant Mitchell and Michael Henry. Several of Amery's Progressive Conservative Colleagues, including Mary O'Neill, Albert Klapstein, and Wayne Cao, also lent their support. However, the bill was defeated on second reading with a majority of the P.C. caucus voting against. Victor Doerksen, the only Conservative to speak in opposition to the bill, expressed concern that instituting mandatory attendance at the kindergarten level constituted an infringement on parental autonomy. New Democrat Raj Pannu, the only member of his caucus present for the vote, also opposed the bill, on the grounds that it would allow private groups to provide kindergarten with the approval of the Minister of Learning. In 1996, Amery sponsored the Wildlife Amendment Act, a government bill that created a scientific committee to make recommendations on the designation of endangered and threatened species, expanded fish and wildlife agents' abilities to check for infractions of firearms regulations by hunters, and downloaded several government powers that had previously resided with the Lieutenant Governor by Order in Council to the Minister of Environmental Protection. Some Liberals, including Duco Van Binsbergen and Bruce Collingwood, raised concerns that the bill didn't go far enough, but it was passed into law. =Committee duties= Amery has sat on numerous committees since being elected. In addition to his regular responsibilities as an MLA, he has served as chair of the Environmental Protection Advisory Committee and co-chair of the Secondary Suites Committee as well as a member of the Standing Committee on Privileges and Elections, Standing Orders and Printing, the Standing Committee on Private Bills, the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, the Standing Committee on the Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund, the Standing Committee on Government Services, the Standing Policy Committee on Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, the Standing Policy Committee on Energy and Sustainable Development, and the Cabinet Policy Committee on Community Services in addition to serving as a member of the International Governance Office Advisory Committee, the Glenbow-Museum Advisory Committee, the MLA Committee To Review Low-income Programs, and the MLA Implementation Team on the Future Selection of RHA Members. He was also the MLA representative on the City of Calgary's 2005 World Fair bid. Currently, Amery serves as a member of the Standing Committee on the Economy, the Standing Committee on Private Bills, and the Standing Committee on Privileges and Elections, Standing Orders and Printing. =Political views= Amery has broken with his party on several occasions regarding issues that mattered to his constituents. In March 2006 he was critical of the Ralph Klein government for insufficiently funding school maintenance after the roof of a school in his riding collapsed. In 2007 and during the 2008 election campaign, he advocated rent controls to deal with the tight housing market in urban Alberta, although the position of the Ed Stelmach government was that they would be unhelpful. =Passport incident= In 2002, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police began investigating whether Amery acted as guarantor for the passport application of a constituent who he had not known for the required two years. He was charged with doing so in 2004. The case went to trial in March 2005, when Amery alleged that, by telling him not to use character references from his colleagues, P.C. whip Denis Ducharme undermined \\"Amery's ability to make full answer and defence\\". The charges were ultimately stayed. Federal Politics In December 2017, Amery announced that he would challenge sitting Conservative MP Deepak Obhrai for the nomination in Calgary Forest Lawn. Personal life Amery is married to Mary, and the couple has five children: Mickey, Lila, Leena, Laura, and Malaak. Mickey was elected as the Member of the Alberta Legislature in the 2018 election in the riding of Calgary-Cross. He has been involved in his community, including the community associations in Calgary-East. He identifies Winston Churchill as his political hero.

The bind runes tell that the deceased was a strong thegn. A bind rune () is a ligature of two or more runes. They are extremely rare in Viking Age inscriptions, but are common in earlier (Proto-Norse) and later (medieval) inscriptions.Enoksen, Lars Magnar (1998). Runor: historia, tydning, tolkning, p. 84. Historiska Media, Falun. On some runestones, bind runes may have been ornamental and used to highlight the name of the carver. Description There are two types of bind runes. Normal bind runes are formed of two (or rarely three) adjacent runes which are joined together to form a single conjoined glyph, usually sharing a common vertical stroke (see Hadda example below). Another type of bind rune called a same- stave rune, which is common in Scandinavian runic inscriptions but does not occur at all in Anglo-Saxon runic inscriptions, is formed by several runic letters written sequentially along a long common stemline (see þ=r=u=t=a=ʀ= =þ=i=a=k=n example shown above). In the latter cases the long bind rune stemline may be incorporated into an image on the rune stone, for example as a ship's mast on runestones Sö 158 at Ärsta and Sö 352 in Linga, Södermanland, Sweden, or as the waves under a ship on DR 220 in Sønder Kirkeby, Denmark.

Interpretations The gagaga and the remaining part of the inscriptions have prompted varying and partly fanciful interpretations. =Schneider= Schneider (1969) opts for bull sacrifice, reading g-a as \\"gift, god!\\" and the remaining as :Ginugahelija Hagala wiju bi g[aia]. :\\"the mighty roarer [the sacrificial bull], the Hagal, I dedicate to the spear\\". =Düwel= Düwel (1983) reads the thrice repeated g-a as g[ibu] a[uja] \\"I give good fortune\\". For the second part of the inscription, he has : ginu-ga he[lmat]lija ... hag?l(a) wi[g]ju bi g[aia]. :\\"magical-\\"ga\\", the helmet-destroying hail I dedicate to the spear\\" =Pieper= Pieper (1999) reads g-a as g[ebu] a[nsu] \\"gift to the god [Odin]\\", with following :ginu-ga hellija hag?la wiju bi g[ebu]. :\\"magical-god- gift, hellish hail I dedicate upon this gift\\" =MacLeod and Mees= MacLeod and Mees (2006) read gagaga as an onomatopoeia related to forms like the Undley bracteate's gægogæ, and read the expression as a metrical charm :gagaga ginu gahellija, hagala wiju bi g[aize]. :\\"gagaga I yell resoundingly, hail I dedicate in the s[pear]\\" See also *Æsir *Illerup Ådal *Roman Iron Age weapon deposits *Runic alphabet *Weapons sacrifice Notes References *Düwel, Klaus, Runenkunde 2nd ed., Stuttgart 1983. *MacLeod, Mindy, and Bernard Mees, Runic Amulets and Magic Objects, Woodbridge 2006. *Pieper, Peter, \\"Fluchweihe\\" oder \\"Weihefluch\\": Imitative Kampfesmagie bei den Germanen nach dem Zeugnis von Runeninschriften in: Studien zur Sachsenforschung, 13, 1999, 303-324. *Rundata 2.0 for Windows. *Schneider, Karl, Runische Inschriftenzeugnisse zum Stieropferkult der Angelsachsen in: Festschrift für Edgar Mertner, (hg.)

He was born in Yonggang, in South Pyeongan province, to a family of the Namyang Hong lineage. In 1811, Hong led an army of farmers against the Joseon Dynasty forces and gained control over much of the northwest, even seizing the heavily fortified castle of Jeongju. The rebellion was a result of an oppressive tax regime enforced by the centrally appointed bureaucrats from Seoul, collecting more than the allotted amount of grain from the famine stricken region of Pyeongan province. Rebels initially captured and executed a hated provincial official, and distributed the stockpiled harvest grains. But the momentum of the rebellion resulted in multiple districts joining the movement, which catapulted Hong to a regional rebel leader. Defeating multiple armies dispatched from Seoul, the rebels captured the city of Jeongju, which was a fortified city designed to withstand invasions from Manchuria. At its height, the rebellion controlled most of the area north of the Cheongcheon River. In 1812, a large force from the Joseon army arrived at Jeongju and invested the city in a formal siege. Seeing the impossibility of victory, the rebels set themselves up on top of gunpowder and blew themselves up. The survivors were executed and or enslaved. This event perhaps influenced the Donghak Peasant Rebellion later in the century further south in the Jeolla Province.

Versions of the name in other languages include Samogitian: Ariuogala, Polish: Ejragoła, Russian: Эйрагола Eiragola, Belarusian: Эйрагола Eirahola, Yiddish: אייראַגאָלע Eyragole. History Ariogala is one of the oldest settlements in Lithuania, known from 1252 or 1253 (when the land of Eregalle is mentioned), multiple times devastated by the Teutonic Knights. Ariogala is mentioned in Mindaugas' papers, in which he dedicated one half of the lands of Ariogala to the newly established Lithuanian diocese, which later in 1257 were handed over to the Bishop Christian of Livonia. In the 14th century there stood a wooden castle of Ariogala, which was burned down by the crusaders in 1382. During the times of Vytautas there stood Ariogala Manor. After the Battle of Grunwald better growth opportunities opened for Ariogala, so around 1416 first Christian church was built in Ariogala. In 16th century it was believed that Ariogala was a birthplace of Vytenis. From 1529 or 1592 Ariogala received a town status, and in the 17th century Ariogala's market and trading privileges are mentioned, Ariogala County established. On 12 April 1792, by king Stanislaw August's decree Ariogala was given the status of a free city based on Magdeburg Law, and Coat of arms (City Emblem) for Ariogala was assigned; although in the summer of the same year due to changes in the political situation self-governing autonomy weakened, and in 1795 Ariogala's city rights were suspended by Imperial Russian government. In 1842 Ariogala's public primary school was established, and in 1852 the Christian parish school was established that operated up until 1863. In 1847 Ariogala's Evangelical Lutheran Church was built, it was demolished in 1944. In 1880 post office was set up in Ariogala, that was burned down during the World War I. At the beginning of 20th century Ariogala's Hospital was established. In 1907 separate schools for boys and girls were established in Ariogala. During the World War II Ariogala, as the entire Lithuania, was occupied by Nazi Germany. In 1941 all the Jews from Ariogala and some nearby villages were gathered in a ghetto.http://yahadmap.org/#village/ariogala-kaunas-lithuania.1036 At the end of August/beginning of September 1941, around 700 Jewish men, women and children were shot in a field near the village. On 3 August 1944, the town of Ariogala was burned down and occupied by the Soviet Union army. After the war up until 1948 the United Kestutis partisan congregation – Vaidotas team of Anti-Soviet resistance was active in Ariogala area, the newspaper \\"Freedom Bell\\" was published. On 28 December 1956 city rights were reinstated. During the Soviet times a few industries were established in Ariogala: reinforced concrete factory, \\"\\" sewing factory subsidiary, and office of the Raseiniai irrigation construction factory.

It is located on the Mera river near the Lithuanian state border with Belarus. According to the Lithuanian census of 2011, it had 140 residents. It is the birthplace of Marshal Józef Piłsudski, who later became Chief of State of Poland. In 1920–1922 the village was located in the Republic of Central Lithuania, and then in Poland until 1939. History = Grand Duchy of Lithuania = The village's earliest known name is Mieciany. At some later point, the name was changed to Zalavas (). The village was first mentioned in the late 17th century as the private property of Aleksander Wojna-Jasieniecki, a Castellan of Navahrudak. It then passed to the Giedraičiai princely family, and in the 18th century the village was bought by the Rurikid Ogiński family, one of the notable magnate clans of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. = Russian occupation = In the early 19th century the village was inherited by the Michałowskis. As part of the dowry of Helena Michałowska, it passed to her husband, Antoni Billewicz, who then bequeathed it to their daughter, Maria Billewiczówna. In 1863, after marrying Józef Wincenty Piłsudski, the village became the property of the Piłsudski family. It was there that both their sons were born, Bronisław Piłsudski, on November 2, 1866, and Józef Piłsudski, on December 5, 1867. In July 1874, the local manor burned down and the family moved to Vilnius. Soon afterward the family was forced to sell most of their property in Lithuania including Zalavas and nineteen other villages, in order to pay for legal expenses and fines for Bronisław, who was involved in an assassination attempt on the life of tsar Alexander III of Russia. In 1882 the village was bought by Michał Ogiński, an heir to the Ogiński family who had owned it in the 18th century. However, as the policies of Russification of former lands in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth forbade Poles to purchase any real estate, he was forced to sell it to a Russian merchant from Riga named Klim. The latter sold the village to a certain imperial officer named Kuronosov, who divided the property, sold most of the forests and was forced to abandon the area in 1915, during World War I. = German occupation = The Germans occupied the area in 1916, and most of the remaining forests were cut down. = Polish occupation = In 1920 following the Polish–Lithuanian War, the area was illegally seized by the Republic of Central Lithuania. In 1922, after a disputed election, Central Lithuania was annexed by the Second Polish Republic, and Zalavas was incorporated into the Vilnius Voivodeship. Since the former Piłsudski's property had belonged to a Russian official who abandoned it, it was nationalized, and limited to the core of 65 hectares, and attached to a military base located nearby. In 1934 an association of veterans of the Polish–Soviet War purchased it from the army and a committee was created whose aim was to rebuild the manor of Marshal Piłsudski, who by then was regarded as a Polish national hero. The manor was reconstructed, and officially opened to the public as a museum on October 10, 1937. However, it was destroyed by the Soviets shortly after the Invasion of Poland in 1939. An oak and a memorial stone still mark the location of the former manor. = Lithuanian liberation = According to the Soviet–Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty of 1939, Zalavas was returned to Lithuania.

In a Future Business Leaders of America meeting, Cassidy (Kyle Gallner) comes out on top of the hypothetical business contest. Keith talks to new mayor Woody Goodman (Steve Guttenberg), who states his plan to redesign Neptune, and Woody offers to make Keith police chief. Logan meets Veronica in the girls bathroom and asks her to investigate the \\"witness\\" to the murder of Felix Toombs, and she agrees. Duncan has searched through Meg's files and finds evidence that she was attempting to help an unknown abused child between 7–10 years old. Meg babysat constantly, and Veronica and Duncan will have to break into Meg's house for more evidence. The Casablancas talk to a lawyer. Kendall has received nothing, and Dick (Ryan Hansen) and Beaver each have a trust fund.

At the babysitting job, the kid's parents say that they almost let Meg go because of Duncan. Logan appears at the door of Veronica's babysitting house. Veronica presents information on Logan's accuser. The boy, Edwin's, dad starts acting weirdly towards Veronica and hands her a drawing Edwin made of her, showing her head cut off of her body. Dick and Beaver's biological mother appears at their house. Veronica wins the babysitting job from a high-pressure teacher. However, her son is bratty and high-maintenance.

Logan asks Veronica to prove that Griffith is lying and says that he wasn't the man on the bridge. * Woody Goodman tells Keith of his plan for Neptune, which involves incorporating the wealthy part of the town. * Dick and Beaver's real mother shows up to unlock their trust funds. * Duncan finds a letter in the vent in Meg's room and pockets it. * Sheriff Lamb hints that he was abused by his own father; this is, presumably, his reason for letting Duncan and Veronica go and then returning to the Manning residence. This also marks one of the few times that he immediately takes Veronica seriously when she reports a crime. When cuffing her, he leans forward, to show that he wants her to whisper something in his ear. She then tells him where to look for the secret room.

They are listed as supporting actors but steal the picture with five of their classic routines, including an abbreviated version of \\"Who's On First?\\" Their work earned them a two-picture deal with Universal, and their next film, Buck Privates, made them bona fide movie stars. Songs in the film were by Jerome Kern with lyrics by Dorothy Fields. The film is based on a 1914 novel, Love Insurance by Earl Derr Biggers, the creator of Charlie Chan. It was filmed as a silent movie in 1919 as Love Insurance by Paramount with Bryant Washburn and Lois Wilson, and in 1925 by Universal as The Reckless Age. Synopsis Jim \\"Lucky\\" Moore (Allan Jones), an insurance salesman, comes up with a novel policy for his friend, Steve (Robert Cummings): a 'love insurance policy', that will pay out $1-million if Steve does not marry his fiancée, Cynthia (Nancy Kelly). Encouraged by Jim's argument that Jim has never had to pay out on a policy so that the marriage is a sure thing, Steve accepts. The upcoming marriage is jeopardized by Steve's ex-girlfriend, Mickey (Peggy Moran), and Cynthia's disapproving Aunt Kitty. The policy is underwritten by a nightclub owner, Roscoe (William Frawley), who sends two enforcers – Abbott and Costello – to ensure that the wedding occurs as planned. Everyone involved in the situation winds up sailing or flying to San Marcos (a fictional South American country), where another complication arises, when Lucky falls for Cynthia. Lucky winds up marrying Cynthia, but Roscoe does not have to pay the $1-million because Steve ends up marrying Mickey.

It did little to help, but led to a string of Abbott and Costello films that did save Universal.Green, Stanley (1999) Hollywood Musicals Year by Year (2nd ed.), pub.

It was a monoplane successor to the prewar de Havilland Dragon Rapide biplane. The design came about from the Brabazon Committee report which, amongst other aircraft types, called for a British- designed short-haul feeder for airlines.Jackson 1987, p. 443. The Dove was a popular aircraft and is considered to be one of Britain's most successful postwar civil designs, in excess of 500 aircraft being manufactured between 1946 and 1967. Several military variants were operated, such as the Devon by the Royal Air Force, the Sea Devon by the Royal Navy and the type also saw service with a number of overseas military forces. A longer four-engined development of the Dove, intended for use in the less developed areas of the world, was the de Havilland Heron. A considerably re-designed three-engined variant of the Dove was built in Australia as the de Havilland Australia DHA-3 Drover. Development and design The development team for the Dove was headed by Ronald Eric Bishop, the creator of the de Havilland Mosquito, a wartime fighter-bomber, and the de Havilland Comet, the first commercial jet aircraft in the world. It had been developed to meet the Type VB requirement issued by the Brabazon Committee.de Havilland Dove 30 May 1946. p. 547a. In concept, the Dove was developed to be the replacement of the prewar de Havilland Dragon Rapide. It was also required to be competitive with the large numbers of surplus military transports in the aftermath of the Second World War, such as the Douglas DC-3.The de Havilland Dove 12 April 1945, p. 399. Unlike the Dragon Rapide, the Dove made use of a structure entirely of metal. It also featured other innovations of the time, including constant-speed propellers, flaps, and a retractable tricycle undercarriage.\\"de Havilland Heron.\\" Flight International, 22 January 1954. p. 97. In 1946, aviation magazine Flight praised the qualities of the newly developed Dove, noting its \\"modernity\\" as well as the aircraft's load-carrying capacity, safe engine- failure performance, and positive maintenance features. Considerable attention was paid to aspects of maintainability, many of the components being designed to be interchangeable and easy to remove or replace, such as the rudder, elevator, and power units; other areas include the mounting of the engines upon four quick-release pickup points, the routing of cables and piping, and detachable wings and tail cone.de Havilland Dove 30 May 1946. pp. 547b-547d. The extensive use of special Redux metal-bonding adhesives reduced the need for riveting during the manufacturing process, reducing overall weight and air-skin friction.de Havilland Dove 30 May 1946. p. 547d. While standard passenger versions of the Dove would carry between eight and eleven passengers, the cabin was designed to allow operators to convert between higher and lower density seating configurations. Features such as a single aircraft lavatory and an aft luggage compartment could be removed to provide for increased seating capacity.The de Havilland Dove 12 April 1945, p. 400. Various specialised models were produced for other roles, such as aerial survey, air ambulance, and flying classroom.\\"Commercial Aircraft 1953.\\" Flight International, 6 March 1953. p. 304. A strengthened cabin floor structure was used to enable concentrated freight loads to be carried as well.de Havilland Dove 30 May 1946. p. 547. The Dove could also serve as a dedicated executive transport, and in such a configuration it was capable of seating a total of five passengers; the executive model proved to be popular with various overseas customers, particularly those in the United States.Jerram, Mike. \\"The last de Havilland.\\" Flying Magazine, 120 (9). p. 43. The crew typically consisted of a pilot and radio operator. However, rapidly removable dual flight controls could be installed for a second flying crewmember instead. A combination of large windows and a transparent perspex cabin roof provided a high level of visibility from the cockpit.Schlaeger September 1961, p. 64. From a piloting perspective, the Dove was observed for possessing easy flying qualities and mild stall qualities.Schlaeger September 1961, p. 66. A TKS anti-icing system was available for the Dove, involving an alcohol-based jelly delivered via porous metal strips embedded on the leading edges of the wings and tail. Operational service RNZAF Devon C.1 of 42 Squadron at Wellington Airport in 1971 The Dove first flew on 25 September 1945. In December 1946, the Dove entered service with Central African Airways.\\"Hawker Siddeley Aviation.\\" Flight International, 26 November 1964. p. 919. Initial production of the Dove was performed at de Havilland's Hatfield factory, but from 1951 onwards, the aircraft were built at the company's Broughton facility near Chester.Jackson 1987, p. 444. The final example of the type was delivered in 1967. Production of the Dove and its variants totalled 544 aircraft, including two prototypes, 127 military-orientated Devons and 13 Sea Devons. From 1946 large numbers were sold to scheduled and charter airlines around the world, replacing and supplementing the prewar designed de Havilland Dragon Rapide and other older designs. The largest order for the Dove was placed by Argentina, which ultimately took delivery of 70 aircraft,Jackson 1987, p. 445. the majority of which were used by the Argentine Air Force. LAN Chile took delivery of twelve examples and these were operated from 1949 onwards until the aircraft were sold to several small regional airlines in the United States in 1954.Sykes 1972 In excess of 50 Doves were sold to various operators in the United States by Jack Riley, an overseas distributor for the type. De Havilland later assumed direct control of U.S. sales, however did not manage to match this early commercial success for the type.Collins, Richard L. \\"On Top: Life of Riley.\\" Flying Magazine, April 1975. 96(4). p. 8. An early batch of 30 Devons was delivered to the Royal Air Force,Jackson 1987, p. 446. these aircraft were used as VIP and light transports for over 30 years. The Royal New Zealand Air Force acquired 30 Devons between 1948 and 1954 and these remained in service for VIP, crew-training and light transport duties into the 1970s. The Biafran Air Force operated a single Dove during the Nigerian Civil War, the aircraft was lost and subsequently found in 1970 on the premises of a school in Uli.Cooper, Tom. \\"Civil War in Nigeria (Biafra), 1967–1970.\\" Acig.org 13 November 2003. A second US-registered Riley Dove N477PM delivered in 1967 to Port Harcourt from Switzerland never reached Biafra because it was stopped by Algerian authorities. A few Doves and civilianised Devons remain in use in 2011 in the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany and elsewhere with small commercial firms and with private pilot owners.

The Bartuva river flows through the town. Monument for the Pain of the Nation Vilnius str. in Skuodas in 2013 Bartuva river in Skuodas History Skuodas was first mentioned in written sources in 1253. At that time it belonged to Ceklis land. In 1572 city rights were granted to Skuodas thanks to Jan Hieronimowicz Chodkiewicz who owned the city. The same year after the city rights were granted, a new part of the city started to settle on the right wing of Bartuva river. In the centre of this part there were built a new rectangular square, town hall, commercial buildings. After Chodkiewicz's era Sapieha family got the city as a trousseau and became the owners of Skuodas. Sapieha family owned the city until 1832. In 1776 Skuodas lost city rights and became just a border city with a customs. In 1821 present masonry Evangelical Lutheran Church was built. In 1847 current Catholic Church was built using masonry of stone and bricks. It reflects features of Romanesque Revival architecture. This church was consecrated by bishop Motiejus Valančius in 1850. In 1614 parish school was established.http://www.skouds.lt/?zm=1238051597 Railway branch line Priekule- Klaipėda was built in 1915 and printing house was established in 1911. The town had a Jewish community in the 19th century, with 4 synagogues. By 1897,almost 2,300 Jews formed 60% of the population and dominated commerce in the town. In 1941, following the German invasion,http://www.holocaustatlas.lt/EN/#a_atlas/search//page/1/item/145/ and the establishment of persecutions by Lithuanian nationalists, 500 Jews of the town were massacred.Shmuel Spector, ed., The Encyclopedia of Jewish Life Before and During the Holocaust, New York University Press, 2001, p. 1197 During the interwar period Skuodas had about 4410 inhabitants. It was known for its shoe factory Kontinent. Skuodas also had a new cinema with modern equipment. The city suffered severely during World War II. After the war the ruined rectangular square was rebuilt. In 1992 the coat of arms of Skuodas was approved.http://www3.lrs.lt/pls/inter3/dokpaieska.showdoc_l?p_id=2083 Nowadays Skuodas has a gymnasium, a primary school, a secondary school and a high school. There is also a museum, post office, centre of the culture, central hospital of municipality, foster home and public library in the city. =History of the name= The city's name Skuodas originated from the surname, Skuodas. Germans called the city Schoden, and Skudn. At the end of the 16th century, the new part of the city was called Johanisberg or Johanisburg. However these names did not catch on.

The engine was designed and built in limited numbers by Bristol Siddeley Engines Limited. The project was cancelled in early 1965. Design and development Based on the 300-series Olympus,http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1962/1962%20-%200761.html the BS.100 was similar in general arrangement to that of the company's Pegasus design, but with the addition of plenum chamber burning (PCB), to enable the projected Hawker Siddeley P.1154 VSTOL fighter design to accelerate to supersonic speed Gunston 1989, p.38. and to allow the aircraft to hover. PCB is similar to reheat, but combustion is only applied to the bypass air (i.e. the front nozzles). PCB was quite difficult to develop since combustion had to occur on the bends between fan exit and entry to the two vectoring front nozzles and at much lower inlet pressure and temperature than a conventional afterburner. The PCB flame-holders were highly complex sheet metal fabrications which were difficult to envisage on a 2D engineering drawing. Consequently 3D models in wood had to be produced to aid development of the system.Pegasus:The Heart Of The Harrier, Andrew Dow 2009, Chapter 6 Variable area front nozzles were required. This was to be achieved by movable ramps mounted horizontally on the fuselage between the front and rear nozzles. For vertical flight and subsonic cruise, the nozzle area would be large, whereas with the PCB lit during acceleration to supersonic speed the ramps would be expanded, reducing flow to the front nozzles and diverting more flow into the core.Pegasus:The Heart Of The Harrier, Andrew Dow 2009, Chapter 6 Although PCB ran on a Pegasus 2 development engine, it was never fitted to any of the BS100-8 engines that were built and never flew.Pegasus:The Heart Of The Harrier, Andrew Dow 2009, Chapter 6 The BS.100 was also intended for the Fokker Republic D-24.http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1962/1962%20-%201016.htmlhttp://www.flightglobal.com/airspace/media/experimentalaircraftcutaways/fokker- republic-d-24-cutaway-9325.aspx Variants A range of BS100 engines were studied in the early 60's, but it was the BS100-8 that was finally selected for Development Manufacture and was actually built.Pegasus:The Heart Of The Harrier, Andrew Dow 2009, Chapter 6 Engines on display A preserved Bristol Siddeley BS.100 is on public display at the Fleet Air Arm Museum, RNAS Yeovilton.

Beer is one of the oldest drinks humans have produced. The first chemically confirmed barley beer dates back to at least the 5th millennium BC in Iran, and was recorded in the written history of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia and spread throughout the world. Though, the ancient Chinese artifacts suggested that beer brewed with grapes, honey, hawthorns, and rice were produced as far back as 7,000 BC. As almost any cereal containing certain sugars can undergo spontaneous fermentation due to wild yeasts in the air, it is possible that beer-like drinks were independently developed throughout the world soon after a tribe or culture had domesticated cereal. Chemical tests of ancient pottery jars reveal that beer was produced as far back as about 7,000 years ago in what is today Iran.http://www.beer100.com/history/beerhistory.htm This discovery reveals one of the earliest known uses of fermentation and is the earliest evidence of brewing to date. In Mesopotamia, the oldest evidence of beer is believed to be a 6,000-year-old Sumerian tablet depicting people consuming a drink through reed straws from a communal bowl. A 3,900-year-old Sumerian poem honouring Ninkasi, the patron goddess of brewing, contains the oldest surviving beer recipe, describing the production of beer from bread made from barley. In China, residue on pottery dating from around 5,000 years ago shows beer was brewed using barley and other grains. The invention of bread and beer has been argued to be responsible for humanity's ability to develop technology and build civilization. The earliest chemically confirmed barley beer to date was discovered at Godin Tepe in the central Zagros Mountains of Iran, where fragments of a jug, from between 5,400 and 5,000 years ago was found to be coated with beerstone, a by-product of the brewing process. Beer may have been known in Neolithic Europe as far back as 5,000 years ago, and was mainly brewed on a domestic scale. Beer produced before the Industrial Revolution continued to be made and sold on a domestic scale, although by the 7th century AD beer was also being produced and sold by European monasteries. During the Industrial Revolution, the production of beer moved from artisanal manufacture to industrial manufacture, and domestic manufacture ceased to be significant by the end of the 19th century. The development of hydrometers and thermometers changed brewing by allowing the brewer more control of the process, and greater knowledge of the results. Today, the brewing industry is a global business, consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries. More than 133 billion liters (35 billion gallons) are sold per year—producing total global revenues of $294.5 billion (£147.7 billion) in 2006. Early beers Rock mortars in Raqefet Cave, used to make beer during the Stone Age.

Chemical tests of ancient pottery jars reveal that beer was produced about 3,500 BC in what is today Iran, and was one of the first-known biological engineering tasks where the biological process of fermentation is used. Also, archaeological findings show that Chinese villagers were brewing fermented alcoholic drinks as far back as 7000 BC on small and individual scale, with the production process and methods similar to that of ancient Egypt and ancient Mesopotamia. The earliest archaeological evidence of fermentation consists of 13,000-year-old residues of a beer with the consistency of gruel, used by the semi-nomadic Natufians for ritual feasting, at the Raqefet Cave in the Carmel Mountains near Haifa in Israel. In Mesopotamia (ancient Iraq), early evidence of beer is a 3,900-year- old Sumerian poem honoring Ninkasi, the patron goddess of brewing, which contains the oldest surviving beer recipe, describing the production of beer from barley via bread. Approximately 5,000 years ago, workers in the city of Uruk were paid by their employers in beer.George, Alison (22 June 2016). \\"The world's oldest paycheck was cashed in beer\\".

Confirmed written evidence of ancient beer production in Armenia can be obtained from Xenophon in his work Anabasis (5th century BC) when he was in one of the ancient Armenian villages in which he wrote: Beer became vital to all the grain- growing civilizations of Eurasian and North African antiquity, including Egypt—so much so that in 1868 James Death put forward a theory in The Beer of the Bible that the manna from heaven that God gave the Israelites was a bread- based, porridge-like beer called wusa. These beers were often thick, more of a gruel than a drink, and drinking straws were used by the Sumerians to avoid the bitter solids left over from fermentation. Though beer was drunk in Ancient Rome, it was replaced in popularity by wine. Tacitus wrote disparagingly of the beer brewed by the Germanic peoples of his day. Thracians were also known to consume beer made from rye, even since the 5th century BC, as the ancient Greek logographer Hellanicus of Lesbos says. Their name for beer was brutos, or brytos. The Romans called their brew cerevisia, from the Celtic word for it. Beer was apparently enjoyed by some Roman legionaries. For instance, among the Vindolanda tablets (from Vindolanda in Roman Britain, dated c. 97–103 AD), the cavalry decurion Masculus wrote a letter to prefect Flavius Cerialis inquiring about the exact instructions for his men for the following day. This included a polite request for beer to be sent to the garrison (which had entirely consumed its previous stock of beer). Ancient Nubians had used beer as an antibiotic medicine. A funerary model of a bakery and brewery, from the Eleventh dynasty of Egypt, circa 2009–1998 BC In ancient Mesopotamia, clay tablets indicate that the majority of brewers were probably women, and that brewing was a fairly well respected occupation during the time, being the only profession in Mesopotamia which derived social sanction and divine protection from female deities/goddesses, specifically: Ninkasi, who covered the production of beer, Siris, who was used in a metonymic way to refer to beer, and Siduri, who covered the enjoyment of beer.Hartman, L. F. and Oppenheim, A. L., (1950) \\"On Beer and Brewing Techniques in Ancient Mesopotamia,\\" Supplement to the Journal of the American Oriental Society, 10. Retrieved 20 September 2013. Mesopotamian brewing appears to have incorporated the usage of a twice-baked barley bread called bappir, which was exclusively used for brewing beer. It was discovered early that reusing the same container for fermenting the mash would produce more reliable results; brewers on the move carried their tubs with them.Tom Standage, A History of the World in 6 Glasses, 2005:17. The Ebla tablets, discovered in 1974 in Ebla, Syria, show that beer was produced in the city in 2500 BC. Early traces of beer and the brewing process have been found in ancient Babylonia as well. At the time, brewers were women as well, but also priestesses. Some types of beers were used especially in religious ceremonies. In 2100 BC, the Babylonian king Hammurabi included regulations governing tavern keepers in his law code for the kingdom. In Ancient India, the Vedas and Ramayana mention a beer-like drink called sura consumed during the Vedic Period (c. 1500 – c. 500 BCE). It was the favourite of the god Indra. Kautilya has also mentioned two intoxicating beverages made from rice called Medaka and Prasanna. Beer was part of the daily diet of Egyptian pharaohs over 5,000 years ago. Then, it was made from baked barley bread, and was also used in religious practices. During the building of the Great Pyramids in Giza, Egypt, each worker got a daily ration of four to five liters of beer, which served as both nutrition and refreshment that was crucial to the pyramids' construction.Tucker, Abigail (August 2011). \\"The Beer Archaeologist\\". Smithsonian.com. The Greek writer Sophocles (450 BCE) discussed the concept of moderation when it came to consuming beer in Greek culture, and believed that the best diet for Greeks consisted of bread, meats, various types of vegetables, and beer or \\"ζῦθος\\" (zythos) as they called it.ζῦθος, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek- English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library The ancient Greeks also made barleywine (Greek: \\"κρίθινος οἶνος\\" – krithinos oinos, \\"barley wine\\"κρίθινος, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseusοἶνος, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus) mentioned by Greek historian Polybius in his work The Histories, where he states that Phaeacians kept barleywine in silver and golden kraters.Polybius, The Histories, 34.9.15, on Perseus During the £1.5bn upgrade of the A14 in Cambridgeshire evidence beer brewed in the UK, dating back more than 2,000 years was found. Steve Sherlock, the Highways England archaeology lead for the A14 project said, “It’s a well-known fact that ancient populations used the beer-making process to purify water and create a safe source of hydration, but this is potentially the earliest physical evidence of that process taking place in the UK.” Roger Protz, the former editor of the Campaign for Real Ale’s Good Beer Guide, said, \\"When the Romans invaded Britain they found the local tribes brewing a type of beer called curmi.\\" In Europe during the Middle Ages, a brewers' guild might adopt a patron saint of brewing. Arnulf of Metz (c. 582–640) and Arnulf of Oudenburg (c. 1040–1087) were recognized by some French and Flemish brewers. Belgian brewers, too, venerated Arnulf of Oudenburg (aka Arnold of Soissons), who is also recognized as the patron saint of hop-pickers. Christian monks built breweries, to provide food, drink, and shelter to travelers and pilgrims. Charlemagne, Frankish king and ruler of the Holy Roman Empire during the 8th century, considered beer to be an important part of living, and is often thought to have trained some brewers himself. Medieval Europe Beer was one of the most common drinks during the Middle Ages. It was consumed daily by all social classes in the northern and eastern parts of Europe where grape cultivation was difficult or impossible. Though wine of varying qualities was the most common drink in the south, beer was still popular among the lower classes. The idea that beer was consumed more commonly than water during medieval times is a myth. Water was cheaper than beer, and towns/villages were built close to sources of fresh water such as rivers, springs, and wells to facilitate easy access to the resource. Though probably one of the most popular drinks in Europe, beer was frequently disdained as being unhealthy, possibly because ancient Greek and more contemporary Arab physicians had little or no experience with the drink. In 1256, the Aldobrandino of Siena described the nature of beer in the following way: The use of hops in beer was written of in 822 by the Carolingian Abbot Adalard of Corbie.Ian Spencer Hornsey: A History of Beer and Brewing. Royal Society of Chemistry, 2003, , p 305 Flavoring beer with hops was known at least since the 9th century, but was only gradually adopted because of difficulties in establishing the right proportions of ingredients. Before that, gruit, a mix of various herbs, had been used, but did not have the same preserving properties as hops. Beer flavored without it was often spoiled soon after preparation and could not be exported. The only other alternative was to increase the alcohol content, which was rather expensive. Hopped beer was perfected in the medieval towns of Bohemia by the 13th century. German towns pioneered a new scale of operation with standardized barrel sizes that allowed for large-scale export. Previously beer had been brewed at home, but the production was now successfully replaced by medium-sized operations of about eight to ten people. This type of production spread to Holland in the 14th century and later to Flanders and Brabant, and reached England by the late 15th century.Medieval science...; Brewing English ale and beer brewing were carried out separately, no brewer being allowed to produce both. The Brewers Company of London stated \\"no hops, herbs, or other like thing be put into any ale or liquore wherof ale shall be made – but only liquor (water), malt, and yeast.\\" This comment is sometimes misquoted as a prohibition on hopped beer. However, hopped beer was opposed by some: > Ale is made of malte and water; and they the which do put any other thynge > to ale than is rehersed, except yest, barme, or goddesgood [three words for > yeast], doth sophysticat there ale.

G.ii – iii. Early modern Europe A 16th-century brewery In Europe, beer brewing largely remained a home activity in medieval times. By the 14th and 15th centuries, beermaking was gradually changing from a family-oriented activity to an artisan one, with pubs and monasteries brewing their own beer for mass consumption. In the late Middle Ages, the brewing industry in northern Europe changed from a small-scale domestic industry to a large-scale export industry. The key innovation was the introduction of hops, which began in northern Germany in the 13th century. Hops sharply improved both the brewing process and the quality of beer. Other innovations from German lands involved larger kettle sizes and more frequent brewing. Consumption went up, while brewing became more concentrated because it was a capital-intensive industry. Thus in Hamburg per capita consumption increased from an average of 300 liters per year in the 15th century to about 700 in the 17th century. The use of hops spread to the Netherlands and then to England. In 15th century England, an unhopped beer would have been known as an ale, while the use of hops would make it a beer. Hopped beer was imported to England from the Netherlands as early as 1400 in Winchester, and hops were being planted on the island by 1428. The popularity of hops was at first mixed—the Brewers Company of London went so far as to state \\"no hops, herbs, or other like thing be put into any ale or liquore wherof ale shall be made—but only liquor (water), malt, and yeast.\\" However, by the 16th century, ale had come to refer to any strong beer, and all ales and beers were hopped, giving rise to the verse noted by the antiquary John Aubrey: > Greeks, Heresie, Turkey-cocks and Beer > Came into England all in a year. the year, according to Aubrey, being the fifteenth of Henry VIII (1524).Oliver Lawson Dick, ed. Aubrey's Brief Lives. Edited from the Original Manuscripts, 1949, p. xxxv. In 1516, William IV, Duke of Bavaria, adopted the Reinheitsgebot (purity law), perhaps the oldest food regulation still in use through the 20th century (the Reinheitsgebot passed formally from German law in 1987). The Gebot ordered that the ingredients of beer be restricted to water, barley, and hops; yeast was added to the list after Louis Pasteur's discovery in 1857. The Bavarian law was applied throughout Germany as part of the 1871 German unification as the German Empire under Otto von Bismarck, and has since been updated to reflect modern trends in beer brewing. To this day, the Gebot is considered a mark of purity in beers, although this is controversial. Most beers until relatively recent times were top-fermented. Bottom-fermented beers were discovered by accident in the 16th century after beer was stored in cool caverns for long periods; they have since largely outpaced top-fermented beers in terms of volume. For further discussion of bottom-fermented beers, see Pilsner and Lager. Asia There is pre-historic evidence that shows brewing began around 5400 BC in Sumer (southern Iraq). However, as with the history of corn whiskey, the production of other alcoholic drinks is often seen as a way to preserve excess grain, rather than an occupation in and of itself. Documented evidence and recently excavated tombs indicate that the Chinese brewed alcoholic drinks from both malted grain and grain converted by mold from prehistoric times, but that the malt conversion process was largely considered inefficient in comparison with the use of molds specially cultivated on rice carrier (the resulting molded rice being called 酒麴 (Jiǔ qū) in Chinese and Koji in Japanese) to convert cooked rice into fermentable sugars, both in the amount of resulting fermentable sugars and the residual by products (the Chinese use the dregs left after fermenting the rice, called 酒糟 (Jiǔzāo), as a cooking ingredient in many dishes, frequently as an ingredient to sauces where Western dishes would use wine), because the rice undergoes starch conversion after being hulled and cooked, rather than whole and in husks like barley malt. Furthermore, the hop plant being unknown in East Asia, malt-based alcoholic drinks did not preserve well over time, and the use of malt in the production of alcoholic drinks gradually fell out of favor in China until disappearing from Chinese history by the end of the Tang Dynasty. The use of rice became dominant, such that wines from fruits of any type were historically all but unknown except as imports in China. The production of alcoholic drink from cooked rice converted by microbes continues to this day, and some classify the different varieties of Chinese 米酒 (Mǐjiǔ) and Japanese sake as beer since they are made from converted starch rather than fruit sugars. However, this is a debatable point, and such drinks are generally referred to as \\"rice wine\\" or \\"sake\\" which is really the generic Chinese and Japanese word for all alcoholic drinks. Some Pacific island cultures ferment starch that has been converted to fermentable sugars by human saliva, similar to the chicha of South America. This practice is also used by many other tribes around the world, who either chew the grain and then spit it into the fermentation vessel or spit into a fermentation vessel containing cooked grain, which is then sealed up for the fermentation. Enzymes in the spittle convert the starch into fermentable sugars, which are fermented by wild yeast. Whether or not the resulting product can be called beer is sometimes disputed, since: # As with Asian rice-based liquors, it does not involve malting. # This method is often used with starches derived from sources other than grain, such as yams, taro, or other such root vegetables. Some Taiwanese tribes have taken the process a step further by distilling the resulting alcoholic drink, resulting in a clear liquor. However, as none of the Taiwanese tribes are known to have developed systems of writing, there is no way to document how far back this practice goes, or if the technique was brought from Mainland China by Han Chinese immigrants. Judging by the fact that this technique is usually found in tribes using millet (a grain native to northern China) as the ingredient, the latter seems much more likely. Asia's first brewery was incorporated in 1855 (although it was established earlier) by Edward Dyer at Kasauli in the Himalayan Mountains in India under the name Dyer Breweries. The company still exists and is known as Mohan Meakin, today comprising a large group of companies across many industries. The Industrial Revolution The Caledonian Brewery, founded in 1869, Edinburgh, Scotland Following significant improvements in the efficiency of the steam engine in 1765, industrialization of beer became a reality. Further innovations in the brewing process came about with the introduction of the thermometer in 1760 and hydrometer in 1770, which allowed brewers to increase efficiency and attenuation. Prior to the late 18th century, malt was primarily dried over fires made from wood, charcoal, or straw, and after 1600, from coke. In general, none of these early malts would have been well shielded from the smoke involved in the kilning process, and consequently, early beers would have had a smoky component to their flavors; evidence indicates that maltsters and brewers constantly tried to minimize the smokiness of the finished beer. Writers of the period describe the distinctive taste derived from wood-smoked malts, and the almost universal revulsion it engendered. The smoked beers and ales of the West Country were famous for being undrinkable – locals and the desperate excepted. This is from \\"Directions for Brewing Malt Liquors\\" (1700): > In most parts of the West, their malt is so stenched with the Smoak of the > Wood, with which 'tis dryed, that no Stranger can endure it, though the > inhabitants, who are familiarized to it, can swallow it as the Hollanders do > their thick Black Beer Brewed with Buck Wheat. An even earlier reference to such malt was recorded by William Harrison, in his \\"Description of England\\", 1577: > In some places it [malt] is dried at leisure with wood alone, or straw > alone, in other with wood and straw together, but, of all, the straw-dried > is the most excellent. For the wood-dried malt, when it is brewed, beside > that the drink is higher of colour, it doth hurt and annoy the head of him > that is not used thereto, because of the smoke. Such also as use both > indifferently do bark, cleave, and dry their wood in an oven, thereby to > remove all moisture that should procure the fume ... \\"London and Country Brewer\\" (1736) specified the varieties of \\"brown malt\\" popular in the city: > Brown Malts are dryed with Straw, Wood and Fern, etc. The straw-dryed is the > best, but the wood sort has a most unnatural Taste, that few can bear with, > but the necessitous, and those that are accustomed to its strong smoaky > tang; yet it is much used in some of the Western Parts of England, and many > thousand Quarters of this malt has been formerly used in London for brewing > the Butt-keeoing-beers with, and that because it sold for two shillings per > Quarter cheaper than Straw-dryed Malt, nor was this Quality of the Wood- > dryed Malt much regarded by some of its Brewers, for that its ill Taste is > lost in nine or twelve Months, by the Age of the Beer, and the strength of > the great Quantity of Hops that were used in its preservation. A hydrometer measures beer's specific gravity The hydrometer transformed how beer was brewed. Before its introduction beers were brewed from a single malt: brown beers from brown malt, amber beers from amber malt, pale beers from pale malt. Using the hydrometer, brewers could calculate the yield from different malts. They observed that pale malt, though more expensive, yielded far more fermentable material than cheaper malts. For example, brown malt (used for Porter) gave 54 pounds of extract per quarter, whilst pale malt gave 80 pounds. Once this was known, brewers switched to using mostly pale malt for all beers supplemented with a small quantity of highly coloured malt to achieve the correct colour for darker beers. The invention of the drum roaster in 1817 by Daniel Wheeler allowed for the creation of very dark, roasted malts, contributing to the flavour of porters and stouts. Its development was prompted by a British law of 1816 forbidding the use of any ingredients other than malt and hops. Porter brewers, employing a predominantly pale malt grist, urgently needed a legal colourant. Wheeler's patent malt was the solution. Yeast ring used by Swedish homebrewers in the 19th century to preserve the yeast between brewing sessions. Louis Pasteur's 1857 discovery of yeast's role in fermentation led to brewers developing methods to prevent the souring of beer by undesirable microorganisms. In 1912, the use of brown bottles began to be used by Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company of Milwaukee, Wisconsin in the United States. This innovation has since been accepted worldwide and prevents harmful rays from destroying the quality and stability of beer.Joseph Schlitz Brewing Co.: A Chronological History Modern beer Bottling beer in a modern facility, 1945, Australia Traditional fermenting building (center) and modern fermenting building (left) in Pilsner Urquell Brewery (Czech Republic) Many European nations have unbroken brewing traditions dating back to the earliest historical records. Beer is an especially important drink in countries such as Belgium, Germany, Austria, Ireland, the UK (England, Wales, and Scotland), France, the Scandinavian countries, Poland, the Czech Republic, Spain and others having strong and unique brewing traditions with their own history, characteristic brewing methods, and styles of beer. Unlike in many parts of the world, there is a significant market in Europe (the UK in particular) for beer containing live yeast. These unfiltered, unpasteurised brews are more challenging to handle than the commonly sold \\"dead\\" beers; \\"live\\" beer quality can suffer with poor care, but many people prefer its taste. While beer is usually matured for relatively short times (a few weeks to a few months) compared to wine, some of the stronger so-called real ales have been found to develop character and flavour over the course of as much as several decades. World beer consumption per capita In some parts of the world, breweries that had begun as a family business by Germans or other European émigrés grew into large companies, often passing into hands with more concern for profits than traditions of quality, resulting in a degradation of the product. In 1953, New Zealander Morton Coutts developed the technique of continuous fermentation. Coutts patented his process, which involves beer flowing through sealed tanks, fermenting under pressure, and never coming into contact with the atmosphere, even when bottled. His process was introduced in the US and UK, but is now used for commercial beer production only in New Zealand. In some sectors brewers are reluctant to embrace new technology for fear of losing the traditional characteristics of their beer. For example, Marston's Brewery in Burton on Trent still uses open wooden Burton Union sets for fermentation in order to maintain the quality and flavour of its beers, while Belgium's lambic brewers go so far as to expose their brews to outside air in order to pick up the natural wild yeasts which ferment the wort. Traditional brewing techniques protect the beer from oxidation by maintaining a carbon dioxide blanket over the wort as it ferments into beer. Modern breweries now brew many types of beer, ranging from ancient styles such as the spontaneously-fermented lambics of Belgium; the lagers, dark beers, wheat beers and more of Germany; the UK's stouts, milds, pale ales, bitters, golden ale and new modern American creations such as chili beer, cream ale, and double India pale ales. Today, the brewing industry is a huge global business, consisting of several multinational companies, and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries. Advances in refrigeration, international and transcontinental shipping, marketing and commerce have resulted in an international marketplace, where the consumer has literally hundreds of choices between various styles of local, regional, national and foreign beers. ;United States Prior to Prohibition, there were thousands of breweries in the United States, mostly brewing heavier beers than modern US beer drinkers are used to. Beginning in 1920, most of these breweries went out of business, although some converted to soft drinks and other businesses. Bootlegged beer was often watered down to increase profits, beginning a trend, still on-going today, of the American markets heavily advertising the weaker beers and keeping them popular. Consolidation of breweries and the application of industrial quality control standards have led to the mass-production and the mass-marketing of huge quantities of light lagers. Advertising became supreme, and bigger companies fared better in that market. The decades after World War II saw a huge consolidation of the American brewing industry: brewing companies would buy their rivals solely for their customers and distribution systems, shutting down their brewing operations.This practice led to a number of lawsuits, most notably Bloor v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., 454 F.Supp. 258 (S.D.N.Y. 1978), affirmed, Bloor v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., 601 F.2d 609 (2nd Cir. 1979). The trial court's written opinion contains a well-researched history of beer. Despite the record increases in production between 1870 and 1895, the number of firms fell by 46%. Average brewery output rose significantly, driven partly by a rapid increase in output by the largest breweries. As late as 1877, only four breweries topped 100,000 barrels annually. By 1895, the largest sixteen firms had greatly increased their productive capacity and were all brewing over 250,000 barrels annually; and imports have become more abundant since the mid-1980s. The number of breweries has been claimed as being either over 1,500 in 2007 or over 1,400 in 2010, depending on the source. As of June 2013, The Brewers Association reports the total number of currently operating US breweries to be 2,538, with only 55 of those being non-craft breweries. Mythology Gambrinus–king of beer The Finnish epic Kalevala, collected in written form in the 19th century but based on oral traditions many centuries old, devotes more lines to the origin of beer and brewing than it does to the origin of mankind. The mythical Flemish king Gambrinus (from Jan Primus (John I)), is sometimes credited with the invention of beer. According to Czech legend, deity Radegast, god of hospitality, invented beer. Ninkasi was the patron goddess of brewing in ancient Sumer. In Egyptian mythology, the immense blood-lust of the fierce lioness goddess Sekhmet was only sated after she was tricked into consuming an extremely large amount of red-coloured beer (believing it to be blood): she became so drunk that she gave up slaughter altogether and became docile. In Norse mythology the sea god Ægir, his wife Rán, and their nine daughters, brewed ale (or mead) for the gods. In the Lokasenna, it is told that Ægir would host a party where all the gods would drink the beer he brewed for them. He made this in a giant kettle that Thor had brought. The cups in Ægir's hall were always full, magically refilling themselves when emptied. Ægir had two servants in his hall to assist him; Eldir [Fire-Kindler] and Fimafeng [Handy]. In Nart sagas, Satanaya (Ubykh , Adyghe , Ossetian ), the mother of the Narts, a fertility figure and matriarch, invented beer. Recent Irish Mythology attributes the invention of beer to fabled Irishman Charlie Mops Etymology The word beer comes from old Germanic languages, and is with variations used in continental Germanic languages, bier in German and Dutch, but not in Nordic languages. The word was imported into the British Isles by tribes such as the Saxons. It is disputed where the word originally comes from. Many other languages have borrowed the Dutch/German word, such as French bière, Italian birra, Romanian \\"bere\\" and Turkish bira. The Nordic languages have öl/øl, related to the English word ale. Spanish, Portuguese and Catalan have words that evolved from Latin cervisia, originally of Celtic origin. Slavic languages use pivo with small variations, based on a pre-Slavic word meaning \\"drink\\" and derived from the verb meaning \\"to drink\\". Chuvash \\"pora\\" its r-Turkic counterpart, which may ultimately be the source of the Germanic beer- word.https://web.archive.org/web/20150402192119/http://curis.ku.dk/ws/files/123468698/Ph.d._2014_Hyllested.pdf See also * Alewife * Food history * Jofroi of Waterford, a Paris-based Dominican who about 1300 wrote a catalogue of all the known wines and ales of Europe, describing them with great relish, and recommending them to academics and counselors. * Women in brewing References Bibliography * Apps, Jerry.

He taught at Harvard University between 1977 and 1983, after which time he returned to MIT as a professor.Asia 21 Bio Between 1998 and 2003 Blanchard served as the Chairman of the Economics Department at MIT. Blanchard has published numerous research papers in the field of macroeconomics, as well as undergraduate and graduate macroeconomics textbooks. In 1987, together with Nobuhiro Kiyotaki, Blanchard demonstrated the importance of monopolistic competition for the aggregate demand multiplier. Most New Keynesian macroeconomic models now assume monopolistic competition for the reasons outlined by them. He is a fellow and past Council member of the Econometric Society, and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. International Monetary Fund During his tenure as Chief Economist, Blanchard's reshaped IMF policies. During the Great Recession Blanchard supported global fiscal stimulus. During its slow recovery he urged a cautious removal of stimulus and advocated quantitative easing. =Austerity v. stimulus debate= By 2010, following the financial crisis, many countries ran significant budget deficits. There was a global turn to austerity as Washington Consensus economists encouraged governments to cut spending and raise taxes to avoid a government debt crisis, as occurred in Greece. In June 2010, Blanchard and Carlo Cottarelli, the director of the IMF's fiscal affairs department, co-authored an IMF blog post entitled \\"Ten Commandments for Fiscal Adjustment in Advanced Economies.\\" By 2011 Paul Krugman noted that Blanchard was already \\"suggesting that harsh austerity programs may be literally self- defeating, hurting the economy so much that they worsen fiscal prospects.\\" Krugman thinks that by 2012, every country that had introduced \\"significant austerity\\" had suffered economically, and that Blanchard had issued \\"what amounted to a mea culpa.\\" According to Krugman, \\"the IMF now believes that it massively understated the damage that spending cuts inflict on a weak economy.\\" On the other hand, the IMF under Blanchard in 2014 was forced to admit that it had overestimated the negative effects of austerity - the IMF had warned of low growth because the British government did not spend enough, but in the end, the British economy grew much larger than the IMF had predicted. IMF-head Christine Lagarde apologized to the British government for the mistake. =Inequality= Under Blanchard's tenure at IMF, Jonathan D. Ostry and Andy Berg published their findings that \\"inequality was detrimental to sustained growth.\\" By April 2014, in the World Economic Outlook, Blanchard situated inequality as a \\"central issue\\" for \\"macroeconomic developments.\\" References  External links  * Olivier Blanchard's webpage at the Peterson Institute for International Economics Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:ESCP Europe alumni Category:Paris Dauphine University alumni Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni Category:Harvard University faculty Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty Category:French economists Category:Macroeconomists Category:New Keynesian economists Category:French academics Category:Fellows of the Econometric Society Category:Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences Category:International Monetary Fund people Category:People from Amiens Category:20th-century economists Category:21st-century economists Category:Expatriate academics in the United States Category:Labor economists Category:French officials of the United Nations Category:Peterson Institute for International Economics ","title":"Olivier Blanchard"},{"id":"3934057","text":"John of Wallingford (died 1214), also known as John de Cella, was Abbot of St Albans Abbey in the English county of Hertfordshire from 1195 to his death in 1214. He was previously prior of Holy Trinity Priory at Wallingford in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire), a cell of St Albans. He should not be confused with another John of Wallingford (died 1258), who was a friend of the famous chronicler Matthew Paris; nor with the unknown author of the so-called \\"Chronicle of John of Wallingford\\" (ca. 1225–1250), that is included in a manuscript of the papers of the later John of Wallingford. Life According to Matthew Paris's Gesta Abbatum (\\"Actions of the Abbots\\"), John came from a moderate family not far from a place called Stodham,Matthew Paris, Gesta Abbatum, vol i., p. 217: non procul a vinculo qui \\"Stodham\\" dicitur, ex mediocri prosapia oriundus.

A tradition that he was from the family of John de la Hyde de Southcote, ancestor of the Hyde family of Denchworth, is apparently mentioned by some editions of Burke's Landed Gentry but it is not clear what the basis for this may be. The Gesta records that John studied in Paris. He gained an excellent reputation and \\"in grammar he was considered a very Priscian, in poetry a perfect Ovid, and in physic esteemed equal to Galen\\".Matthew Paris, Gesta Abbatum, vol i., p. 217. Apparently the abbot was a judex urinarum incomparabilis (vol i., p. 246.) After taking Benedictine vows, he was sent to Wallingford Priory, where he became prior in 1191. From this he gained his St Albans by-names \\"de Wallingford\\" and \\"de Cella\\", having been superior of this important cell of the abbey. Four years later, on 20 July 1195, he was elected Abbot of St. Albans, where he presided with \\"sanctity and success\\".P.H. Ditchfield and William Page, eds. (1907), A History of the County of Berkshire: Volume 2 (Victoria County History series), pp. 77-79. He rebuilt the refectory and the dormitory, and extended the west front of the abbey church, though not without difficulty: the work \\"swallowed up the revenues as the sea the rivers, and made no progress\\", until a simplifed design was eventually completed.William Page, ed. (1908), A History of the County of Hertford: volume 2 (Victoria County History series), pp. 483-488. He was regarded by the 19th-century scholar Henry Richards Luard as the originator of the core of Roger of Wendover's Flores Historiarum, which became the first part of Matthew Paris's Chronica Majora, but this has since been questioned.See Flores Historiarum for details.

Development originally started under P.1150, which was essentially a larger and faster version of the basic layout and technology being developed by the smaller subsonic Hawker Siddeley P.1127/Kestrel. A key difference of this design was the addition of plenum chamber burning, essentially an afterburner-like arrangement in the thrusters used during hover, greatly increasing their thrust. The release of NATO Basic Military Requirement 3 for a VTOL strike-fighter led to widespread industry participation. Hawker felt the P.1150 did not meet the requirements, so it was enlarged to become P.1150/3, and then renamed P.1154. This Mach 2-capable aircraft was the technical winner of the eleven submissions for NBMR-3, with the Dassault Mirage IIIV selected as a second design. Political infighting between the two groups and their various supporters, along with continual changing of the strategic environment, led to neither project progressing into production. Meanwhile, Hawker Siddeley considered modifying the airframe for a joint specification for an aircraft by the RAF and Royal Navy. Between 1961 and 1965 the two services harmonised their specifications to preserve design commonality. However, the RAF's desired configuration was to take precedence over that of the Royal Navy's. A number of proposals were submitted – at one stage, a twin-Spey design was considered, then rejected. Following the Labour government's coming to power the project was cancelled in 1965. The Royal Navy would acquire the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, while the RAF continued to foster development of the P.1127 (RAF), leading to the successful Harrier Jump Jet family. Development =Background= During the late 1950s, Hawker Siddeley Aviation (HSA) was keen to develop a new generation of combat aircraft that would be capable of supersonic speeds. Unfortunately, despite repeated attempts to revive the program, the in-development Hawker P.1121 fighter would ultimately be left unfinished, principally due to a lack of a political support for development following the release of the 1957 Defence White Paper by Minister of Defence Duncan Sandys.Wood 1975, pp. 211-213. Recognising the need to promptly commence work on another development program, HSA's chief aircraft designer Sir Sydney Camm, who had been in regular discussions with Sir Stanley Hooker of Bristol Aero Engines, decided that the company should investigate the prospects of developing and manufacturing a viable combat-capable vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) fighter aircraft.Wood 1975, p. 213. Bristol Aero Engines and Hooker had already been working on a project to produce a suitable VTOL engine; this engine combined major elements of their Olympus and Orpheus jet engines to produce a directable fan jet.\\"VTOL Aircraft 1965\\". Flight, 20 May 1965 p. 769. The projected fan jet harnessed rotatable cold jets which were positioned on either side of the compressor along with a 'hot' jet which was directed via a conventional central tailpipe.Mason 1967, p. 3. With a suitable engine already being developed, Camm and his team at HSA proceeded to develop the company's first VTOL aircraft, designated as the Hawker Siddeley P.1127. The P.1127 was envisioned as a subsonic VTOL-capable strike aircraft, while also serving to demonstrate and prove the capabilities of the aircraft's basic configuration and to validate the performance of the Rolls-Royce Pegasus engine that powered it. While financial backing was issued by NATO's Mutual Weapons Development Program to support development of the Pegasus engine, the British government were not forthcoming with funding. While HSA chose to go ahead with the P.1127 as a private venture, the Air Staff disagreed heavily over what requirements should be set out for a future RAF VTOL aircraft; some officers, such as the Chief of the Air Staff Sir Thomas Pike, advocated simplicity while others, such as the RAF operational requirements division, sought various performance demands of such an aircraft, particularly the capacity for supersonic flight.Wood 1975, pp. 213-214. HSA was also interested in the prospects and feasibility of a more sophisticated development of the P.1127, knowing that a supersonic-capable VTOL aircraft would likely be more attractive to customers, there being a general perception at the time that supersonic aircraft held significantly more value their subsonic counterparts.Wood 1975, p. 214. Consequently, on 13 April 1961, HSA decided to conduct preliminary work on a supersonic derivative of the P.1127 under the guidance of Ralph Hooper. This would result in a new design, designated P.1150, which was 50% larger than the preceding P.1127; it was proposed that a new performance-enhancing feature be adopted in the form of the plenum chamber burning (PCB) – similar to an afterburner, but acting only on the bypass air that discharged through the front nozzles.Wilson 2000, p. 9. The P.1150 proposal broadly resembled its P.1127 predecessor despite major changes being made, including its revised fuselage, the adoption of a thinner wing, and an advanced version of the Pegasus engine. The Bristol Siddeley BS100 engine was equipped with a similar arrangement of four swivelling exhaust nozzles, the front nozzles of which were to be equipped with PCB. According to aviation author Derek Wood, the P.1150 was to have been capable of Mach 1.3.Wood 1975, pp. 215-224. =NATO requirements= alt=Slightly-angled front view of jet aircraft on blue floor in museum. Two aircraft are in the background, one of which is suspended near the ceiling. In August 1961, NATO released an updated revision of its VTOL strike fighter requirement, NATO Basic Military Requirement 3 (NBMR-3).Jefford 2006 et al, p. 12. Specifications called for a supersonic V/STOL strike fighter with a combat radius of . Cruise speed was to be Mach 0.92, with a dash speed of Mach 1.5. The aircraft, with a payload, had to be able to clear a obstacle following a takeoff roll. Victory in this competition was viewed being of a high importance at the time as it was seem as being potentially \\"the first real NATO combat aircraft\\". However, due to changes made to the requirement, the P.1150 was considered undersized and thus unsatisfactory, which led to a desire for a redesign. Wood views the decision not to persist with the original P.1150 design a \\"serious setback...it would have provided a first class basic type\\". HSA formed an agreement with the German Focke-Wulf aircraft company to collaborate on a joint study that looked into the issue of equipping the P.1150 with two additional lift engines. However, in October 1961, West Germany elected to entirely withdraw from the programme. This was a blow directly felt not only by HSA and the development team, but by the British Air Ministry, who had been also seeking to collaborate with its West German counterparts on the VTOL aircraft. Meanwhile, further studies served to confirm fears the P.1150 would be too small to meet customer specifications, so Camm initiated work on an enlarged derivative design. In conjunction with HSA's redesign, Bristol worked to enlarge the original PCB engine and raise the exhaust heat to increase thrust to 146.8 kN (30,000 lbf).Wilson 2000, p. 9.Jenkins 1998, p. 19. It could have theoretically reach speeds of up to Mach 1.7–2. The new, larger aircraft design soon emerged, initially designated P.1150/3, then redesignated P.1154.Buttler 2000, p. 118. In January 1962, HSA submitted the P.1154 design to NATO via the Ministry of Aviation.Wood 1975, p. 215. NBMR.3 also attracted ten other contenders, among which was P.1154's principal competitor, the Dassault Mirage IIIV. The Mirage IIIV was supported by British Aircraft Corporation (BAC), and also had the favour of several members of the Air Staff. In May 1962, the P.1154 emerged as the winner in the competition for the NBMR.3. While the P.1154 was judged to be technically superior, the Mirage acquired a greater level of political palatability due to the co-operative development and production aspects proposed for the programme, which spread work across a number of member nations. Protracted political maneuvering by firms and national governments alike was deployed in attempts to secure their respective project's selection. The P.1154 was ultimately selected to meet NBMR-3, but this did not lead to orders being placed. The French government subsequently withdrew from participation once the Dassault design lost.Jefford 2006 et al, pp. 12–13. NATO lacked any central budget, relying on individual member nations to actually procure military equipment, and the NBMR-3 selection went unheeded by all of these nations. Thus, in 1965, the whole project was terminated. =RAF and Royal Navy requirements= On 6 December 1961, prior to the design being submitted to NATO, it was decided that the P.1154 would be developed with the requirements for use by both the RAF and the Royal Navy.Buttler 2000, pp. 118–119. In February 1962, the Royal Navy's Admiralty received the aircraft concept with great interest as the Royal Navy was in the process of seeking a new interceptor aircraft for use on their aircraft carriers at the time. By March 1962, the Ministry of Defence was openly interested in the potential for the P.1154 being adopted as a replacement for both the RAF's fleet of Hawker Hunters and the Royal Navy's de Havilland Sea Vixens. Accordingly, in April 1962, a first draft of a new joint Naval/Air Staff requirement was issued in the form of Specification OR356/AW406, to which HSA had submitted a response by June of that year. Following the cancellation of the NBMR-3 requirement, HSA focused all its attention onto working upon this joint requirement.Wood 1975, p. 216. The services sought different characteristics in their aircraft – the RAF desired a single-seat fighter with secondary intercept capability, while the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) sought a two-seat interceptor capable of secondary low-level strike capability.Buttler 2000, p. 119. Accordingly, HSA's submission involved the development of two distinct variants of the same P.1154 aircraft, each aimed towards a particular service and its stated requirements. Although financially and politically committed to a joint requirement with the Royal Navy, the RAF's single-seat design took precedence over the two-seat version of the Royal Navy. However, RAF P.1154s would have to accommodate the Navy's large airborne intercept (AI) radar.Wood 1975, p. 220. When HSA submitted the design on 8 August, the Royal Navy criticised the proposal, which had a tandem undercarriage layout incompatible with catapult operations; consequently, a tricycle undercarriage design was investigated and accepted as practical. The aircraft would have been armed with the Red Top missile. In November 1962, Rolls-Royce offered a PCB-equipped vectored thrust twin-Spey design as an alternative to the BS100. This alternative engine arrangement was widely seen as inferior, particularly due to the danger posed by asymmetric thrust output if a single engine failure occurred; however, Rolls-Royce claimed that their solution could be available sooner than the BS100 would be.Wood 1975, pp. 216-217. In December 1962, Bristol performed the first successful run of a PCB-equipped Pegasus 2 engine.Wood 1975, p. 217. In order to perform a vertical takeoff, the use of PCB was necessitated; however, this feature would have come at the cost of significant ground erosion during operations. In December 1962, HSA dedicated its full effort to developing the RAF's single seat variant; Wood notes the starting point for which was broadly similar to the proposal submissions for NBMR-3. On 18 February 1963, Julian Amery, the Minister of Aviation, confirmed that the project study contract had been placed; on 25 March, Amery announced that the BS100 had been selected as the powerplant to be used on the P.1154. At this point, the program was envisioned to involve the ordering of a total of 600 aircraft, 400 for the RAF and 200 for the Royal Navy.Wood 1975, p. 218. However, as HSA carried out further work on the detailed design phase of the programme, it was becoming clear that opinions on the internal equipment for the aircraft varied substantially between the two services. The difficulty of handling the divergent requirements was compounded when, in May 1963, shortly following on from the official issuing of Specification OR356/AW406, the option of having two distinct aircraft was rejected; the Secretary of State for Defence, Peter Thorneycroft, had insisted upon the development of a single common aircraft to meet the requirements of both services. According to Woods, Thorneycroft's decision had been influenced by the American General Dynamics F-111 multirole program, and had sought to duplicate this development concept for the P.1154.Wood 1975, pp. 218-220. Despite a stated Navy preference for a swing- wing fighter, the services agreed that the aircraft would be completely common, with the exception of different radar systems.Buttler 2000, pp. 119–120. However, upon requests by various electronics manufacturers to the Ministry of Aviation to be issued with the requirements for the electronics fit, no response was ever issued; this lack of leadership proved disruptive to the overall programme. =Disfavour and cancellation= As a consequence of the diverging requirements of the RAF and Royal Navy, the aircraft's development had started to stumble. As a result of modifications towards meeting the naval requirements having been performed, by July 1963, weight gain had become a considerable issue for the aircraft. By that point, the Royal Navy was expressly criticising the choice of a V/STOL aircraft. By August 1963, HSA was openly expressing the view that the range of changes being made to the aircraft was damaging its potential for export sales. At the same time, the Navy stated that it regarded the P.1154 to be a second-rate interceptor, and the RAF openly decried the loss of strike performance. By October 1963, the Ministry of Aviation was concerned with the project's progress, and noted that the effort to combine a strike aircraft and a fighter in a single aircraft, and trying to fit that same airframe to both of the services, was \\"unsound\\".Buttler 2000, p. 120. By October 1963, according to Woods, the situation had become critical and some officials were beginning to examine alternative options, such as conventional fighter aircraft in the form of the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II. By November 1963, the RAF reportedly still found the P.1154 to be a suitable platform, while the Royal Navy appeared to be considering the F-4 Phantom II as being a better fit for its needs. In response, HSA elected focused its efforts on the RAF version. In late 1963, dissatisfied with the progress of the 'bi-service' model, the government examined three alternative options for the programme; to proceed with an RAF-orientated P.1154 while the Naval version would be delayed, pursue the development of a full dual-service P.1154 model with only limited differences between the services, or the complete termination of the program with the service's requirements to be re-appraised.Wood 1975, p. 222. In November 1963, the Sunday Telegraph publicly announced that the bi-service P.1154 had been aborted. Wood attributes Thorneycroft ambition to reconcile the requirements of the two services into the one model and insistence on this vision as having \\"put the whole project in jeopardy\\".Wood 1975, pp. 222-223. Around this point, the Royal Navy expressed their open preference for the F-4 Phantom II and soon Thorneycroft conceded that the service would get this aircraft instead, and that development of the P.1154 would continue to meet the RAF's requirement.Wood 1975, p. 223. On 26 February 1964, it was announced in the House of Commons by the Conservative government that a development contract had been placed for the P.1154, equipped with the BS100 engine, as an RAF strike aircraft.Buttler 2000, p. 121. At the same time, it was announced that the Naval requirement would instead be met by Spey-engined Phantoms. Wood stated that this decision was \\"the beginning of the end for the 1154 as the original operation requirement was for joint-service use\\".Wood 1975, pp. 223-224. F-4 Phantom II.alt=Starboard black-and-white view of jet aircraft in-flight. In the aftermath of the government announcement, HSA persisted with work on the P.1154. By September 1964, the first full-scale mock-up meeting had been conducted.Wood 1975, p. 224. On 30 October 1964, a milestone in the development programme was attained when the first run of a BS100 engine was performed; around the same time, HSA received favourable reports that the P.1154 was competitive with the performance of other aircraft, including the F-4 Phantom II. The P.1154 ultimately became a victim of the incoming Labour government, led by Harold Wilson. In November 1964, Wilson's government informed the Air Staff to prepare to cancel two of three specific ongoing development projects, these being the P.1154, the BAC TSR-2 strike aircraft, and the Hawker Siddeley HS.681 V/STOL transport aircraft; in order to save the TSR-2 programme, the RAF was satisfied to abandon the P.1154. On 2 February 1965, it was announced that the P.1154 had been terminated on the grounds of cost. At the time of cancellation, at least three prototypes had reached various stages of construction. Following the cancellation, the RAF and Royal Navy both adopted the F-4 Phantom II instead; however, the government also issued a contract for continued work on the original subsonic P.1127 (RAF), which led to the Harrier; this name had originally been reserved for the P.1154 should it enter service. In retrospect, aviation author Tony Buttler considered the cancellation of the aircraft to be justified, noting the time- consuming and expensive failures of attempts by other nations (such as Soviet/Russia's Yak-41 and West Germany's EWR VJ 101) at a supersonic VTOL aircraft. These aircraft all used a multiple engines configuration like the Mirage IIIV, and not the single vectored thrust turbofan of the likes of the BS.100 and Pegasus which went on to great success in the Harrier. Wood described the overall situation as: \\"From start to finish the P.1154 programme was a story of delay, ministerial interference and indecision... the P.1150 would now be the ideal aircraft for the new generation through-deck cruisers\\" Specifications (P.1154 – RAF version) Planform silhouettes of the P.1154, with the single-seat RAF version on the left and tandem, two-seat Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm version on the right See also References =Notes= =Citations= =Bibliography=  Mason, Francis K.

Written by John Enbom and Cathy Belben and directed by Steve Gomer, the episode premiered on November 23, 2005 on UPN. The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life as a high school student while moonlighting as a private detective. In this episode, the parents of Marcos, a student who died in the bus crash, contact Keith (Enrico Colantoni) and Veronica to investigate who has been harassing them by leaving them reminders of their son. Meanwhile, Veronica and Logan (Jason Dohring) further investigate Logan's murder charges.  Synopsis  Duncan (Teddy Dunn) has a dream involving Meg (Alona Tal) and Veronica. After Duncan wakes up, Veronica reports her findings about Dr. Griffiths to Logan. Duncan puts Meg’s letter from the previous episode into a drawer. Two parents of a student in the bus crash, Marcos Oliveres, come into Mars Investigations and that someone is harassing and stalking them over their son’s death. They say that they know who’s harassing them, but they just want proof. Veronica meets a man named Danny Boyd (Taylor Sheridan), who was previously operated on by Dr. Griffith. Boyd leads her into a bar, where she learns that Dr. Griffith received a medical reprimand for putting stitches on Danny Boyd. Veronica’s identity is outed by another person, and Danny Boyd’s friend asks for the real reason why Veronica is there. After lying again, Veronica gets attacked by the man before Logan comes in and saves Veronica by holding the man up at gunpoint. Keith asks Veronica about Marcos, and she doesn’t know him. Veronica asks around about Marcos at school, but he was a loner. Keith sends Veronica a quote from someone about Marcos. Keith also finds some bizarre evidence involving an MP3 paid for by the Neptune school district broadcasting Marcos’s voice in Mrs. Oliveres’s car. Veronica confronts the principal, but he denies any knowledge. Veronica talks to Mac (Tina Majorino), who gives Veronica information that Marcos was actually the anchor of a popular school radio show. Marcos’s show was mostly about roasting various Neptune high students, leading Veronica to believe that anyone could be behind the harassment. Veronica confronts Weevil (Francis Capra) about her belief that he set up Tom Griffith for a favor from the Fitzpatricks, where Danny Boyd was from. However, Weevil was not behind the scheme, and Weevil warns his gang that he will find the insubordinate person. Later, Weevil talks to another biker, who tells him that Logan did stab Felix. However, Weevil is still skeptical. At the house where the MP3 was recorded, Veronica and Mac find Vice Principal Clemmons and eventually fake needing to see the vice principal’s son, Vincent, to get into the house. Veronica and Mac find recording devices in Vincent’s basement room and find out that something might have happened at a summer camp. Vincent denies any knowledge. Mr. Oliveres is unhappy with Keith’s findings so far. Veronica does some digging and finds that Marcos was being sent to a conversion therapy camp. Keith stakes out the Oliveres's house while they are away and finds a neighbor going into the Oliveres’ house using their security code to get some beer from their kitchen. However, that is apparently normal for him. Keith finds a toy school bus in their fish tank and the security code scribbled on the back of a piece of scrap paper with the name of the lawyer firm representing the school's district. Logan is kidnapped by unknown bikers, who subjects Logan to torture involving Russian roulette with various body parts. Logan says that he does not remember the night of the murder of Felix Toombs, and he is let go but not before stealing one of their cell phones. Logan threateningly calls Weevil. Veronica talks to Vincent about Marcos being gay, and he denies that. Vincent says that Marcos was almost beaten up for a romantic situation, as described in the anonymous letter. Keith proves that someone in the family was responsible for the last toy bus and the security code on the back of the piece of paper from the school's law firm. Veronica goes to the house of the “jealous girlfriend” and finds out that a boy was actually responsible for the harassment. He was in love with Marcos, and while they were flirting, Marcos’s parents came in and sent him to the conversion therapy camp. Marcos became depressed, and when he died, the boy took revenge on his parents by haunting their memories. Duncan has another dream about Meg, and when he wakes up, he opens her letter and says \\"Oh my God!\\"  Cultural references  The following cultural references are made in the episode: *Weevil mentions John DeLorean. *The bar that Danny Boyd leads Veronica into is called The River Styx. *Liam references Lucky Charms. *Veronica compares Marcos to Howard Stern. *A running joke in the episode is that Mac is Q to Veronica's James Bond. *Mac asks Veronica to go to RadioShack. *The episode mentions Rosemary's Baby. *Logan makes a play on words with Nip/Tuck. *Logan also jokingly calls Veronica \\"Mars-wan Kenobi\\", a reference to Obi-Wan Kenobi. *Veronica sarcastically mentions Three Little Pigs when talking to Weevil. *When going into Principal Clemmons's house, Veronica and Mac say lines from The Rocky Horror Picture Show. *Veronica says a line from In Living Color.  Arc significance  *Duncan agonizes about reading Meg's letter, but finally does. *Veronica tries to help Logan by getting more information about Dr. Tom Griffith. She goes to see Danny who had a bar fight wound treated by Dr. Griffith, and finds that he's a friend of the Fighting Fitzpatricks. Liam Fitzpatrick spots Veronica and she almost gets hurt before Logan arrives and threatens him with a gun.

The interior of the old Passage in the 1850s. The Passage, from the French word passage,The first Paasage was built in Paris in 1798: the '. is an élite department store on Nevsky Avenue in Saint Petersburg, Russia, which was founded in 1848. The Passage premises have long had associations with the entertainment industry and houses the Komissarzhevskaya Theatre. 19th century The site where the Passage sprawls had been devoted to trade since the city's foundation in the early 18th century. It had been occupied by various shops and warehouses (Little Gostiny Dvor, Schukin Dvor, Apraksin Dvor) until 1846, when Count Essen-Stenbock- Fermor acquired the grounds to build an elite shopping mall for the highest echelons of the Russian nobility and bourgeoisie. The name came from a vast gallery between Nevsky Avenue and Italianskaya Street which provided the main passage through the mall. The gallery was covered over by an arching glass and steel roof, thus giving it a claim to being one of the world's first shopping malls, along with Passage du Caire in Paris (1798) Burlington Arcade in London, Galerie Vivienne in Paris (1823) and Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert in Brussels. The three-storey building of the Passage opened its doors to consumers on May 9, 1848. It was one of the first structures in Russia to employ gas for lighting. Another innovation was an underground floor, where an electric station would be installed in 1900. Although the store specialized in jewellery, expensive clothes and other luxury goods, crowds of common people flocked to see the most fashionable shop of the Russian Empire. A fee of 50 kopecks had to be introduced in order to limit admissions. Stenbock-Fermor conceived of the Passage as more than a mere shopping mall, but also as a cultural and social centre for the people of St Petersburg. The edifice contained coffee-houses, confectioneries, panorama installations, an anatomical museum, a wax museum, and even a small zoo, described by Dostoyevsky in his extravaganza \\"The Crocodile, or Passage through the Passage\\". The concert hall became renowned as a setting for literary readings attended by the likes of Dostoevsky, Turgenev, and Taras Shevchenko. Within the renovated Passage, 1902. 20th century In 1897 the ownership of the Passage passed from Stenbock-Fermor's heirs to Princess Nadezhda Boryatinsky. A great fire in 1898 necessitated a major renovation, funded by the Crédit Lyonnais, a bank which leased a large portion of the store as its offices. In 1900, the building was revamped, with the addition of a further storey, and refaced in Radom sandstone. The new owner transformed the former concert hall into a theatre employing Vera Komissarzhevskaya as its artistic director. To draw even more consumers to the store, the Soleille, one of the largest cinemas in the Russian capital, was opened in the complex in 1908. After the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the following several years of disorder, the store was reopened as the Passage Supermarket in 1922. It continued in this capacity until 1933, when the municipal authorities declared the Passage a \\"model department store\\", the only one in Leningrad (as the former St Petersburg was then known) and one of only three such stores in the Soviet Union. The renovated \\"palace of Soviet trade\\" (as the media touted it) opened in 1934 and offered about 30,000 types of goods, all manufactured in the USSR. The Children's World section became especially popular with the inhabitants of Leningrad. The Passage remained a showcase of the Soviet industry until the onset of World War II. During the Siege of Leningrad, the shop was closed but the majority of employees chose to remain day and night. The building's glass roof was subjected to intensive bombing, but amazingly the interior sustained little damage. The Passage was restored and reopened for business in 1947. Since 1961, this historic department store has been specializing in goods for women. 21st century Contemporary interior of the Passage The Passage is now privately owned by employees and shareholders. Updates and renovations throughout the entire building were done to meet modern international standards. Expanded showrooms welcomed more customers. Passage established relations with new trade and business partners, such as Escada, and other international department stores. One of the first upscale food markets in Russia, with a wide variety of international produce, opened in the basement. New restaurant opened on the upper level with the panoramic view of the Nevsky Prospect. Jensen Group (real estate investment and development company based in Saint-Petersburg, Russia) acquired Nevsky Passage from VTB Bank in September 2011.

It revolved around life at a newly started TV morning show, Jump Start, and focused on the life of the main character, Casper (played by Casper Christensen). Langt fra Las Vegas consisted of 53 episodes, aired over 5 seasons with each episode lasting 25 minutes. It ran from 2001-2003. Overview The sit-com takes places in the studio and offices of fictional TV channel show Jump Start and in the main character Casper's apartment, both located in Copenhagen, Denmark. Generally the main story revolves around Casper (in later seasons referred to as by his full name, Casper Christensen) who is usually in trouble and tries to fix it with a lie, but always ends up getting caught. Issues of relationships and sex are often central to the show, and topics such as paedophilia and other taboos are touched upon often with a rich imagery (mainly by Casper's boss Niels Buckingham). The show originated on a cable-channel targeting young adults (TV2 Zulu) and successfully made it to the parent, nationwide channel TV2 without any censoring. The city of Las Vegas is never featured nor even mentioned in Langt fra Las Vegas, possibly a reference to the lack of professionalism and showmanship of the characters. The show drastically changed tone from season 1 to 2. Two characters, Wulff and Anne, were completely written out, and several characters returned with their personalities completely changed, such as Kenny being changed from the office smart-ass to a geeky character; Robert being changed from a childish security chief to a seemingly retarded cameraman; and Niels Buckingham, who had been an off-beat character whose sexual deviances were often briefly mentioned, being amplified into a full-blown pervert with every conceivable sexual fetish. Characters * Casper Christensen - Casper Christensen (Season 1-5) **Casper is a young man working as a host/comedian on an unspecified TV-show on the TV channel \\"Jump Start\\". Throughout the series he battles with relationships which he sometimes takes very seriously and at other times views with indifference or engages himself with women out of spite (of former or to-be girlfriends) or in search of sex. He is light tempered and forgiving but often childishly stubborn and a (selfproclaimed?) sex symbol. * Kenny Nickelman - Frank Hvam (Season 1-5) **Kenny is Casper's best friend. The first season aside, he is a sports journalist on the TV channel \\"Jump Start\\". He is usually impeccably dressed in outfits meant for much older or more distinguishble men (tweed, caps, suspenders etc.). Often in bad luck and quite a geek, he is in many ways the complete opposite of Casper. * Niels Buckingham - Klaus Bondam (Season 1-5) **Niels is an anchor-man at the TV channel \\"Jump Start\\" and from season 2 and onwards the CEO of the station. Niels has worked as a foreign correspondent throughout his seemingly long career and often regales in absurd stories from his experiences. He is a blatant pervert with many sexual fetishes, including some illegal ones such as paedophilia and necrophilia. Additionally, he also has various extreme or elaborate fetishes which he often hints at in a rather obvious language. He is also very outspoken about non- sexual intimacies, such as bowel-movements (in one episode he ceremoniously informs the staff that he has diarrhea and then confines himself to his office, ordering Robert to fetch him a large bowl and some old newspapers, his preferred brand of toiletpaper etc.). Niels continuously finds himself in embarrassing situations but sometimes fails to see the problem. At other times he is quite vain. * Liva Eberhardt - Iben Hjejle (Season 2-5) **On-off girlfriend of Casper. An architect by trade but is later hired as a chief of public relations at the TV channel \\"Jump Start\\". Is very intelligent, caring and openminded of some things, but obliviously not to the problems of others, in particular Casper's. * Lisa Bremer Harris - Katja K (Season 1-5) **Lisa is a secretary at the TV channel \\"Jump Start\\". In real life, Katja K was a porn star before being cast for the role as Lisa, a fact that is played upon in the pilot. She is the most sensible and stable person on the Jump Start staff and has frequent run-ins with Robert, her direct opposite. * Robert Dølhus - Lars Hjortshøj (Season 1-5) **Robert is a cameraman and video-editor on the TV- channel \\"Jump Start\\". He is practically a child in a grown person's body, lives on candy and junk food and is constantly making childish references to breasts. Is the favored Guinea pig of Niels who often experiments with different things on Robert or gives him absurd tasks, almost always to Roberts annoyance. Robert is a Hi-Fi enthusiast - purist even. * Kim Dorowsky - Sofie Stougaard (Season 1-5) **Kim is at first the chief at the TV channel \\"Jump Start\\", but after season one resigns to write a book on boxing. Is briefly married to Casper (unhappily). * Wulff - Mikael Wulff (Season 1) * Anne - Stine Stengade (Season 1) =Regular guest cast= * Mogens Knibbe Eberhardt - Henning Jensen **Authoritative father of Liva. An MD by trade and a very orthodox one at that. Cares immensely for Liva's well being and is very suspicious of Casper and his motives with Liva. * Vibeke Eberhardt - Solbjerg Højfeldt **Seemingly submissive wife of Mogens and mother of Liva. Is often being bullied by husband Mogens who, however, loves her dearly.

In 1872 ownership was passed over to the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company of London. In 1873 Hibernia was also under contract to repair the French Atlantic Cable, that stretched from Brest to Saint-Pierre and Miquelon with Wilson Robert Cato as Master at Sheerness. Hibernia assisted in her laying telegraph cables from Heart's Content, Newfoundland to Valentia, County Kerry, Ireland in 1873 and 1874. This cable was originally ordered by the French Atlantic Telegraph Company just before its takeover by the Anglo-American Telegraph Company. After completion, because of the shorter route, of cable was left and so additional cable was ordered to enable another cable to be laid, this being done in 1874. Hibernias task was the laying the short ends of the cables that came ashore. After completion of the cable laying at Heart's Content Hibernia was sent to Brazil to replace broken cables between Pará, Maranhão and Pernambuco. On 21 November 1877, Hibernia sank while anchored off Ponta d'Areia, near São Luís, Maranhão. All crew members were rescued and a few miles of cable were recovered.

Robinson. The company also received a Hunger Hero Award from Second Harvest Heartland in 2014, recognizing C.H. Robinson’s “compassionate and transformational impact on those who are hungry in the heartland.”  History  = Origins and early history = In the early 1900s, Charles Henry Robinson owned a small wholesale brokerage house that provided produce throughout North Dakota and Minnesota. He partnered with the Nash Finch brothers on April 11, 1905, and became the company’s first president. Nash Finch Company was the leading wholesaler in the region, owning and operating grocery stores. Following Charles Henry Robinson’s death in 1909, the Nash Brothers assumed control of the C.H. Robinson Company. C.H. Robinson became the procurement arm for Nash Finch Company as it rapidly expanded in Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Texas. In the 1940s, the FTC found Nash Finch Company to have a price advantage, and under the Robinson-Patman Act of 1936, C.H. Robinson Co. was split into two companies. The first, C.H. Robinson Co., was formed by the offices that sold produce to Nash Finch’s warehouses, and ownership was retained by C.H. Robinson employees. The second company, C.H. Robinson, Inc., was still owned by Nash Finch. = Expansion into logistics and trucking = C.H. Robinson’s entry into the trucking business came after the Federal Highway Act of 1956 expanded interstate commerce and the roadways of America. C.H. Robinson and other shippers had previously relied on trains to transport goods. In 1968, the firm entered the regulated truck business as a contract carrier named Meat Packers Express based in Omaha, Nebraska. Robco Transportation Inc. was formed by merging Meat Packers Express with additional carriers three years later and was sold in 1986. In the mid-1960s, C.H. Robinson Co. and C.H. Robinson, Inc., consolidated their operations under the name C.H. Robinson Co. Nash Finch still held a 25% stake in the brokerage company, with C.H. Robinson employees owning the remainder. By 1976, the Nash Finch shares had been bought out and the company was 100% employee owned. C.H. Robinson focused on using emerging technology, and adopted IBM mainframes in 1979. The Motor Carrier Act of 1980 deregulated transportation industries in America and increased competition for logistics providers and shippers. C.H. Robinson created a contract carrier program, expanded its freight contract operations, and established itself as a middleman sourcing operation for virtually all shippable goods. The company’s average annual growth, measured by truckloads, doubled and C.H. Robinson posted more than $700 million in sale within five years. Forty per cent was generated by truck brokerage, with the remainder of revenue coming from produce sales. = Renaming and IPO = The company renamed itself C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc., in 1997 and had an IPO that raised $190 million for the 101 employees who sold their shares. The initial market value totaled $743 million, and the firm began trading on NASDAQ under the symbol CHRW. Gross revenues for 1997 reached $1.79 billion, while net revenues amounted to $206 million, a 15.1% increase over the previous year.  Acquisitions  Beginning in 1989, C.H. Robinson began expanding its international logistics operations with the opening of its Monterrey, Mexico office. It acquired C.S. Greene International in 1992 to add international freight forwarding, air freight operations, and refrigerated containers. In 1993, C.H. Robinson bought a 30% stake in Transeco, a major French motor carrier, and eventually bought the entire company. C.H. Robinson enhanced its operations by purchasing companies including Daystar International, a distributor of fruit juice, and FoodSource. It also became an exclusive marketer for Tropicana, Motts, Glory and Welch’s. The company continued expanding its logistics services by purchasing regional logistics firms like the Chicago-based American Backhaulers, Inc., for $136 million in 1999. Also acquired the Minnesota-based Trans-Consolidated Inc. At the end of the 1990s, the company began making targeted acquisitions to broaden its global presence and position it to better deliver shipping and logistics services in international markets. These acquisitions include: Preferred Translocation Systems; the Argentina-based Comexter Group; the Western European transportation provider Norminter; New York-based Vertex Transportation Inc.; Smith Terminal International Services, one of the largest third-party logistics providers in Florida; the Germany-based international freight logistics provider Frank M. Viet GmbH Internationale Spedition; Dalian Decheng Shipping Agency Co.; FoodSource Procurement LLC; Apreo Logistics S.A.; and other major European, Indian, Chinese, and North American logistics providers. In 2012, C.H Robinson purchased Phoenix International for $635 million and doubled its ocean freight capacity. The company also acquired the Polish shipping firm Apreo Logisitics S.A., which provides trucking, air, and ocean shipping services throughout Europe. The company launched a technology- enabled platform called Navisphere in 2012. The service provides facilities to C.H. Robinson employees, customers, and service providers to manage supply chain logistics, transportation, and sourcing activities on a global scale. TMC, a division of C.H. Robinson,Mytmc.com provides support for C.H. Robinson’s network through its Managed TMS a combination of global transportation management system (TMS) software and logistics process management.

The trail runs primarily on the abandoned right-of-way of the Tennallytown (Tenleytown) and Rockville Railroad, also known as the Washington and Rockville trolley. Where the trail is not on the right-of-way, it runs on-road, on sidewalks or on side paths. Planning for a trail on the old streetcar right-of-way began in the 1970's. The right-of-way was used by streetcars from 1890 to 1935, when it converted to buses. Some of the right of way then sat fallow for decades. Building a trail on the unused part of the right-of-way was first suggested in Montgomery County's 1978 Countywide Bikeways Master Plan, but design of the trail didn't begin until the early 1990s. Construction was held up for many years due to opposition from neighbors and funding issues, but funding for the bridges over I-495 and I-270 was approved in 1999. Construction of the trail began in fall of 2000 and lasted nearly a decade. Money to reconstruct existing sections of the trail was diverted to the Forest Glen Metro overpass project, delaying work on the trail and it was further delayed by the bridge fabrication. Bridges over I-495 and I-270 opened in 2002 and 2003 respectively, adding to narrow, discontinuous sections that existed prior to 2002 between Nicholson Lane and Beech Avenue. Paving and building the trail from the intersection of Cedar Lane to the intersection of Randolph Road with Rockville Pike began in November 2005, and continued into 2006. Between Charles Street and Cedar Lane and north of Nicholson Lane, the trail was on sidewalks. Around the same time, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) built a trail along the south edge of their facility connecting Rugby Avenue to the sidewalk along Old Georgetown Road. In 2008, the new sections of the trail, including the sidewalks, were signed. As part of the Montrose Parkway West project in 2009, a section of trail — a side path along Rockville Pike — was constructed from Per Sei Place to Hubbard Drive, north of the White Flint Metro Station. That section connected to a path built along Montrose Parkway at the same time.

He started his career as a cathedral organist as Assistant Organist in Hereford Cathedral before becoming the organist of Truro and Gloucester Cathedrals. Heavily influenced by Jean Langlais and Pierre Cochereau, Briggs is regarded as one of the world's finest improvisors, and now works as a concert organist. Briggs is a composer of choral and organ music, and has also transcribed many orchestral works into versions for solo organ, as well as many of Cochereau's recorded improvisations. Biography David Briggs was educated at Solihull School. He was organ scholar at King's College, Cambridge from 1981 to 1984. At the relatively early age of 17 he was awarded the Fellowship of the Royal College of Organists (FRCO). He was also sometime Principal Viola of the National Youth Orchestra. Whilst at university, he toured Australia, New Zealand, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany with the college choir. In 1983 he received the Countess of Munster Award to study Interpretation and Improvisation with Jean Langlais in Paris, with whom he furthered in his interest in the art of improvisation by his transcriptions of the recordings of the late Pierre Cochereau. Transcribing the remarkable improvisations from Cochereau's cassette recordings took eleven years. Briggs' subsequent performances and recordings of them earned him his initial acclaim. He was also the first British organist to win the Tournemire prize for improvisation at the St Albans International Organ Festival. On leaving university, he was appointed as Assistant Organist at Hereford Cathedral where he also took over the directorship of Hereford Chamber Choir and Hereford String Orchestra. He was appointed Organist and Master of the Choristers of Truro Cathedral in 1989, before moving to the similar post at Gloucester Cathedral in 1994. While at Gloucester he oversaw the rebuilding of the organ which included the installation of the \\"Divided Pedal\\". This allows the Pedal Board to be 'split', meaning the pedal stops sound on the lower section, the upper section can be set to reproduce the sound of any of the manuals. Briggs also oversaw the installation of this system on the Father Willis organ of Truro Cathedral in its rebuild in 1991. In May 2002,Hart, David Little style in unfussy approach, 22 August 2002, The Birmingham Post (www.thefreelibrary.com). Retrieved 29 June 2010. Briggs left Gloucester to pursue a freelance career as a concert organist and composer, succeeded for a second time by Andrew Nethsingha. Briggs is Organist Emeritus at Gloucester Cathedral, and gives regular masterclasses at the Royal Northern College of Music and Cambridge University. He has a busy schedule as a concert artist, composer and organ advisor. He resides in Boston, Massachusetts. He married his second wife, Margaret Nimocks, in 2004, adopting a daughter, Eloise, and has two daughters from his previous marriage.Weddings/Celebrations; Madge Nimocks, David Briggs, 4 July 2004, The New York Times.

He made his debut at the BBC Proms on 14 August 2010 as part of \\"Bach Day\\" playing pieces by J S Bach, some originally for organ, others in arrangements, including Briggs' own arrangement of the Orchestral Suite No. 3 in D major, BWV 1068. In September 2012, Briggs became Artist-in-Residence at the Cathedral Church of St. James in Toronto, Canada. His responsibilities included giving celebrity recitals, playing regularly at services, composing liturgical music for the Cathedral, and working on the establishment of a vision for the music program, including the design and installation of a new organ or organs and relevant acoustical enhancements. In October 2017, he became Artist-in-Residence at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City.

Directed by Nick Marck, the episode was co-written by Phil Klemmer and Dayna Lynne North. The episode was first shown on November 30, 2005, on UPN. The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life as a high school student while moonlighting as a private detective. In this episode, Veronica finds her mother's old high school records and starts digging into her mother's past, discovering information about the Kane family in the process. Meanwhile, Beaver (Kyle Gallner) proposes a business plan to help Kendall (Charisma Carpenter). \\"My Mother, the Fiend\\" features the third and final appearance by Alyson Hannigan on the show. The show's crew found it difficult to work an episode into Hannigan's schedule because of other projects. The episode was accompanied by an alternate ending, a publicity move made by executive producer Joel Silver and the UPN promotions department. The episode was initially viewed by 2.82 million viewers and received mostly positive reviews. For example, Rowan Kaiser, of The A.V. Club, wrote \\"I am intrigued by the decisions to make Veronica less than pure, but this time, I'm not as disappointed by the followthrough.\\"  Synopsis  In health class, the whole class starts taking care of fake babies. Vice Principal Clemmons (Duane Daniels) calls Veronica into his office and gives her detention for having keys to his file cabinet. Beaver walks up to Mac (Tina Majorino) and asks her for a few favors. For Veronica's detention, she has to alphabetize files and put them in cabinets. Veronica finds her mother's permanent file and figures out that she was troubled in high school. Logan (Jason Dohring) punches Weevil (Francis Capra) and Logan's cronies beat up on him. Veronica talks to a teacher and finds out that Lianne and that teacher spread false rumors around the school and got suspended because of it. Weevil gets duct-taped to the flagpole. Veronica asks Vice Principal Clemmons about who might have known her mom in high school. Veronica talks to Principal Moorhead, who tells her that her mom was \\"vicious\\". Trina (Alyson Hannigan) is coming back to perform in a play at Neptune High. Kendall tries to seduce Duncan (Teddy Dunn) again. Trina meets Kendall, and the interaction is rife with sarcasm. Veronica looks through her mom's yearbook and eventually tracks down one of her mother's old friends, who provides more information on the love triangle between Celeste (Lisa Thornhill), Jake (Kyle Secor), and Lianne. Veronica asks Keith (Enrico Colantoni) about Lianne's suspension, which she thinks was about spreading a rumor that Celeste was pregnant. Keith says that he doesn't know anything about it. Trina slips and falls during a play rehearsal. Beaver meets with Kendall and confronts her about selling his father's possessions for little money. Beaver gives her his plan, which involves her being the face of his business idea. Keith checks the birth records and finds that no baby was born to either \\"Kane\\" or \\"Carnathan\\" (Celeste's maiden name) at that time. However, he finds a mysterious baby found in the girls' bathroom at the Neptune high prom. Veronica bad-mouths Celeste in Duncan's room before Celeste comes in and Veronica learns that Duncan never told his parents about their relationship. Celeste insults Veronica's mother, and Veronica deduces that Celeste's cleaning lady, Astrid, is probably her daughter. Weevil confronts Logan angrily, and they fight, despite agreeing that they need to team up to find out who actually killed Felix. Mac shows her work to Beaver, which involves his new business project. Veronica, under a disguise, meets with the prom baby's temporary foster mom. Veronica learns that the baby's foster mother committed suicide and her father was in jail, hinting that the baby is Trina Echolls. Veronica talks to Trina and tells her the news of her parentage. Trina actually wants her story to go to the tabloids. However, a deaf lunch lady storms in and says that she's actually Trina's mother. The lunch lady says that Lianne was a friend who covered up her pregnancy to protect her. Trina's father is Principal Moorehead, and Trina confronts him about leaving her at the prom in front of many faculty. Veronica finds the dead rat that Keith picked up at the bus. Veronica finds out that Vice Principal Clemmons deliberately gave Veronica her detention task so that she would find her mother's permanent file and expose Principal Moorehead, leaving Clemmons to be promoted to Principal. Veronica picks up Abel Koontz's (Christian Clemenson) belongings and walks into Meg's (Alona Tal) room and discovers that Meg is pregnant.  Production  \\"My Mother, the Fiend\\" features the final appearance by Alyson Hannigan as Trina Echolls. Thomas said it was difficult trying to write an episode for Hannigan, because of her busy schedule Directed by Nick Marck, \\"My Mother, the Fiend\\" was written by Phil Klemmer and Dayna Lynne North. The episode marks Klemmer's eighth writing credit, the fifth and penultimate writing credit for North, and Marck's seventh directing credit. Despite being credited, Wallace (Percy Daggs III), Dick (Ryan Hansen), and Jackie (Tessa Thompson) do not appear in the episode. Among the episode's guest stars are Alyson Hannigan and Charisma Carpenter, who portray Trina Echolls and Kendall Casablancas, respectively. The two previously starred together in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, with Hannigan playing Willow Rosenberg and Carpenter portraying Cordelia Chase. Although the two characters had appeared previously, they had never shared a scene together. Jason Dohring, who portrays Logan, stated that he had a special connection with Hannigan on-set: \\"We get together and just tease each other, she sucker-punches me. There's just a total, I don't know, we really have a sister-brother thing going on. I've never had that kind of connection with an actress before. It totally works.\\" Dohring also noted that Hannigan responded strongly to any spoilers that she was given during filming of the episode. \\"My Mother, the Fiend\\" also marks Hannigan's third and final guest appearance on the show. Hannigan was open to appearing in another episode, but she was unsure whether or not her busy schedule would allow it. She also felt that the character's arc had come to a natural close in this episode. In an interview, Rob Thomas said that due to her busy schedule, it was difficult to write an episode featuring Hannigan. On Hannigan's role in the episode and her future availability, Thomas commented: Joel Silver wanted to promote the alternate ending for the episode. The episode also features a reappearance by Celeste Kane (Lisa Thornhill), a recurring character during the first season. The second season DVD includes an alternate ending to this episode, which was released around the airing of the episode as a promotional tool. The alternate ending starts the same way as the regular ending, with Veronica discovering that Meg is pregnant. But instead of the episode ending there, Meg's mom comes into the room while Veronica hides in the bathroom. When the mom leaves, Meg is dead with a pillow over her face, indicating smothering. However, Veronica takes the pillow off before a nurse comes in. Thomas commented that the alternate ending was never going to be the actual conclusion to the episode. He said: \\"We never seriously considered having that be the ending. There were various other endings that we did have, but they were so subtly different, it was like, 'When does Veronica enter the room?' \\" The idea to promote the alternate ending was a joint venture from the UPN promotions department and executive producer Joel Silver. After Thomas learned that others wanted an alternate ending, he decided to make it very different from the episode's actual conclusion. \\"But once we could have a [very different] alternate ending, we thought, 'Let's make it rock.' The beauty of having that alternate ending is that we don't have to play it out in the next episode.\\"  Reception  = Ratings = In its original broadcast, \\"My Mother, the Fiend\\" received 2.82 million viewers, marking an increase from \\"Ahoy, Mateys!\\" and ranking 101st (out of 112) in the weekly rankings. = Reviews = The episode received mostly positive reviews. Price Peterson, of TV.com, gave the episode a positive review, writing that he \\"[l]oved this episode. That reveal was simultaneously shocking and heartbreaking. Plus it took one of the show's most annoying characters (Trina) and made her both sympathetic and heartbreaking.\\" He also praised the information found on Veronica's mother: \\"It was nice that Veronica got to see a better side of her mother than we usually do…Heartwarming!\\" Maureen Ryan, of the Chicago Tribune, called the episode \\"engrossing\\" and that it is a better use of a viewer's time than Lost, which aired at the same time as Veronica Mars. Rowan Kaiser, of The A.V. Club, lauded Veronica's characterization as an antiheroine in the episode. \\"I've discussed times when [Veronica has] behaved in ways that I'm not certain are ethical, but this might be the most blatant case. […] Once again, I am intrigued by the decisions to make Veronica less than pure, but this time, I'm not as disappointed by the followthrough.\\" Television Without Pity gave the episode a \\"B\\". Alan Sepinwall singled out the scene between Carpenter and Hannigan and the Weevil and Logan subplot as particular points of praise. Sepinwall also called the alternate ending \\"an interesting little feature\\" while going on to state that he was \\"glad the real show didn't go in that direction.\\" BuzzFeed ranked the episode 48th on its ranking of Veronica Mars episodes, writing that it made the viewer \\"bored.\\" On a similar list, TV Line ranked the episode 19th.

Wodehouse, first published in the United States on 18 August 1939 by Doubleday, Doran, New York, and in the United Kingdom on 25 August 1939 by Herbert Jenkins, London.McIlvaine (1990), p. 76–77, A61. It is set at the idyllic Blandings Castle, home of Clarence, Earl of Emsworth, the fifth full-length novel to be set there. It also features Uncle Fred, who first appeared in the short story \\"Uncle Fred Flits By\\", which was included in the 1936 collection Young Men in Spats, and would feature in three further novels. Plot summary In London, Pongo Twistleton is having money troubles, and his wealthy friend Horace Pendlebury-Davenport is in trouble with his fiancée, Pongo's sister Valerie, for hiring Claude \\"Mustard\\" Pott to trail her during the Drones Club weekend at Le Touquet. Horace having refused to loan him money, Pongo resolves to call on his Uncle Fred, 5th Earl of Ickenham, for assistance. Meanwhile, at Blandings, Horace's uncle Alaric, Duke of Dunstable, as well as demanding eggs to throw at whistling gardeners, has taken it into his head that the Empress needs some fitness training, and Lord Emsworth needs help. In the absence of his trusty brother Galahad, Emsworth calls on Gally's old friend Uncle Fred for assistance in stopping the Duke from taking his prized pig. Horace, having fallen out with his cousin Ricky Gilpin over Gilpin's fiancée Polly Pott, daughter of Mustard, inadvertently makes trouble for Pongo by being dressed as a Zulu rather than a Boy Scout during a round of the \\"Clothes Stakes\\", run by Pott at the Drones. Pongo’s mistaken bet loses all his money, adding to his already large debt. Uncle Fred ponders how to get Polly into Blandings to court her prospective uncle-in-law; Fred thinks the Duke will like her and ignore her background if they meet in a neutral situation. Emsworth creates an opening by insulting Sir Roderick Glossop by calling him a name from their school days, Pimples; Glossop then refuses to come to Blandings to analyse the increasingly loopy Duke of Dunstable, as Emsworth’s sister Connie has requested. Fred heads to Blandings posing as Glossop, with Pongo playing the role of his secretary and nephew, and Polly his daughter Gwendoline. They unexpectedly meet Glossop on the train, who had later been persuaded by Connie to come despite the insult. Fred tells Glossop the Duke is on the train and Glossop can save time by talking with him, and then heading back to London. Fred is not aware that the stranger is Rupert Baxter, now working for the Duke. Arriving at Blandings, they are met by Lord Bosham, who was conned out of his wallet by Uncle Fred the previous day. The Duke sacks Baxter, because he was seen at a ball in London by Horace, but is taken on again when Uncle Fred persuades Horace, and the Duke, that Horace is suffering delusions. Horace heads off for a rest-cure, and Baxter is left unable to reveal that he has seen through Fred's disguise, having met the real Glossop before. Baxter is put on his guard, and informs Lady Constance; she in turn wants to hire a detective to deal with these imposters. Bosham remembers Mustard Pott, and calls him to Blandings. Dunstable's scheme to acquire the pig continues apace, and he calls in his strapping nephew to help. When Gilpin asks for funds to buy an onion soup bar, thus enabling him to marry Polly, the two row and part. Dunstable ropes in Baxter instead. Uncle Fred, meeting Pott just after he has taken £250 from Lord Bosham at \\"Persian Monarchs\\", takes the money off him, insisting it will help Polly marry wealthy Horace. Pott, meeting Gilpin at The Emsworth Arms, tells him about Polly being engaged to Horace, and the enraged poet chases a fearful Horace back to the Castle. Fred gives the money to Pongo to pass on to Polly for Gilpin's benefit, but she is spurned by him, and Pongo then uses the cash to pay off his debts. When Fred has reunited the couple, more money is required. Pott is persuaded to take it from Dunstable at \\"Persian Monarchs\\", but the wily peer wins himself £300. Both Fred and Pott try to get it back, but Dunstable has the pig, captured earlier by Baxter, hidden in his bathroom, and is keeping his room under lock and key. Having knocked out the vigilant Baxter with a Mickey Finn, Fred finally gains access to the room shortly after Pott has done the same, Pongo having lured Dunstable away with a rendition of \\"The Bonnie Banks o' Loch Lomond\\". Fred is caught by a shotgun-bearing Bosham, just as Pott, having discovered the Empress in the bathroom, drinks a second Mickey destined for Dunstable. Bosham locks Fred in a cupboard. Valerie arrives, reunited with her man and hot for vengeance on the uncle that made Horace think himself insane, and confirms Fred's identity; Fred convinces all that Emsworth has become infatuated with Polly, and that he is there to put a stop to it. He takes Dunstable's roll of cash under the pretext of paying Polly off—insisting that his visit remain a secret from Lady Ickenham to maintain the Threepwood dignity—and heads back to London with not only the money for Gilpin's soup bar, but an extra fifty quid for himself to blow on a few joyous weeks in the city.

Hall Jr., the proportion of dialogue to narrative prose increased in Wodehouse's work over time, beginning in the 1920s, after he had started his intensive involvement with the theatre. In Wodehouse's 1904 novel The Gold Bat, the first six chapters (over 10,000 words) contain 42 percent dialogue and 58 percent narrative, whereas in Uncle Fred in the Springtime, which Hall considered representative of Wodehouse's mature humour, the first three chapters (also over 10,000 words) contain 67 percent dialogue and only 33 percent narrative. In Wodehouse's mature style, longer narrative passages usually set the stage for conversational exchanges, while shorter narrative passages often describe actions which, in a theatrical performance, would be directly visible to the audience. However, Wodehouse also uses these narrative passages to make more detailed humorous comments about the dialogue and characters than would be possible in a play when staged.Hall (1974), p. 53–54. Wodehouse generally uses conservative verbal inflection in his narrative prose and dialogue, but occasionally contrasts this with an informal verbal inflection in conversation, such as when Lord Bosham and Lady Constance discuss the Duke of Dunstable's accident in chapter 12: > \\"It's true, is it, that the old bird has bust a flipper?\\" > \\"He has wrenched his shoulder most painfully,\\" assented Lady Constance, with > a happier choice of phrase.Hall (1974), p. 71. Where there is a difference between British and American usage of syntax, Wodehouse often follows the British pattern. While American English uses the simple form of a verb in subjunctive clauses (after verbs referring to desire, necessity, and the like), British English uses the inflected form wherever it is available. For example, in chapter 7, Lord Ickenham says: \\"It is essential [...] that Polly goes to Blandings and there meets and fascinates Dunstable.\\" In American usage, this would be It is essential that Polly go, meet, and fascinate.Hall (1974), p. 72. Commercial products, patent medicines, and other items often have comical names in Wodehouse's stories. For example, in imitation of the names of swords like Excalibur and Durendal, Lord Ickenham's great bath-sponge is called Joyeuse.Hall (1974), p. 103. Exaggerated synonyms are used in Wodehouse's stories to vary the dialogue in humorous ways, such as when a character speaks of squashing in with the domestic staff (chapter 8).Hall (1974), p. 94. Publication history The story was first published as a serial in The Saturday Evening Post from 22 April to 27 May 1939, illustrated by James Williamson. The first US edition dust jacket was illustrated by Peggy Bacon. The first UK edition dust jacket was illustrated by Fenwick. Adaptations The novel was adapted as a radio drama by Archie Scottney in 2012 for BBC Radio 4, directed by Martin Jarvis, who also portrayed Lord Emsworth. The cast also included Ian Ogilvy as the narrator, Patricia Hodge as Lady Constance, and Alfred Molina as Uncle Fred. The radio drama first aired in two parts on 22 April and 29 April 2012. Scenes from the novel were adapted in the first episode of the second series of the Blandings television series, \\"Throwing Eggs\\", which first aired on 16 February 2014.

He was influential in terms of introducing local audiences to European art. He is noted for his portraits and landscapes, painted in the Realist style. Life and Career Abdul Qadir Al Rassam was born in the Maysan Province, Qal'at Saleh District in 1882. Qadir's life straddled two distinct eras in Iraqi history: he was born during Ottoman rule and died in the royal era (1921-1958). He was the first well-known painter in modern Iraq and the leader of realism school in Iraq. He studied military science and at the Military College, Istanbul, Turkey, (then the capital of the Ottoman Empire) from 1904, Ali, W., Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity, University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 46 where drawing and painting were part of the curriculum. Tejel, J., Writing the Modern History of Iraq: Historiographical and Political Challenges, World Scientific, 2012, p. 476 There, he was exposed to the European traditional style and learned to paint in the naive manner of the Turkish soldiers. Along with contemporaries, Salim Mohammed Saleh Zaki (1888-1974) and Hajj Mohammed Salim (1883-1941) who was a relative; all of whom also studied at the Military Academy, this group of Iraqi artists were first generation to paint in the European style.Ali, W., Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity, University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 47 This group became known as the Ottomon artists. Reynolds, D.F., The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture, Cambridge University Press, 2015, p.199 During his military career, he was stationed in Istanbul. However, after retiring in the 1920s, he returned to Baghdad. His wife and family, however refused to leave Istanbul, forcing the artist to live alone in a house in Baghdad. Carpet Ghazi recalled visiting the artist with his father in the 1930s:\\"A journey with memories of eighty years and places where I have gone and symbols: Carpet Gazi recalls the Iraqi creators who did not take their luck from the spotlight on their giving,\\" in Altaahi Press, 20 September, 2016, Online: (translated from Arabic) He was the first local artist to offer painting lessons in his studio, and many modern Iraqi painters began their careers by studying with him.Ali, W., Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity, University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 47; Reynolds, D.F., The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture, Cambridge University Press, 2015, p.199 He was also the first modern Iraqi artist to paint a mural in a public building - at the entrance to the Cinema Royal in Baghdad.Ali, W., Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity, University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 47 He was a major figure among the first generation of modern Iraqi artists and was a founding member of the Art Friends Society (AFS, Jami’yat Asdiqa’ al-Fen). He became a landscape painter, and painted many landscapes of Iraq in the realism style, using shading and composition to suggest time periods. A prolific painter of oils, the majority of his works are now in private hands. A small collection of his work is hung in The Pioneers Museum, Baghdad, Faraj, M., Strokes Of Genius: Contemporary Iraqi Art, London, Saqi Books, 2001, p. 195 but many of these works were looted in 2003.Shabout, N., \\"Ghosts of Futures Past: Iraqi Culture in a State of Suspension,\\" in Denise Robinson, Through the Roadbloacks: Realities in Raw Motion, [Conference Reader], School of Fine Arts, Cyprus University, 23–25 November, pp 94-95 Very little is known about his early life and career. It was only when the researcher and art historian, Jabra Ibrahim Jabra investigated the history of art education in the city of Amarah 1917-1958 that his name was found in the Register of Teachers in the school of Qal'at Saleh for 1916. Work He painted scenes of everyday life in Iraq and landscapes, especially of area around the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. A collection of his work is in The Pioneers Museum, Baghdad.

For now his research concerns particularly social and political philosophy and philosophy of technology. His list of publications shows a great scope (in fields of medical care, labour, third-world-philosophy). In 1967 he took his doctoral degree on Albert Camus. His latest books handle the topics of utopianism (‘De erfenis van de utopie’, ‘The Legacy of Utopia’) and the tension between morality and politics in relation to the Kosovo War (“Politiek van Goede bedoelingen’, ‘Policy of good intentions’). He is co-author of the volume American Philosophy of Technology; The Empirical Turn. This work includes contributions on Albert Borgmann, Hubert Dreyfus, Andrew Feenberg, Donna Haraway, Don Ihde and Langdon Winner.  Main thoughts  His ideas add up to a philosophy of things (objects) and a plea for a morality of machines. Rather than being morally neutral, things guide our behaviour (barriers in the subway forcing us to buy a ticket). This is why they are capable of exerting moral pressure that is much more effective than imposing sanctions or trying to reform the way people think. Utopia has been superseded but the world can still be improved, if we take seriously our moral ties to the machines and devices that surround us.  Philosopher Laureate  In 2011 Achterhuis was chosen as the first Philosopher Laureate of the Netherlands. This honorary title was an initiative of the Magazine Filosofie, and the Philosophy Month Foundation (Stichting Maand van de Filosofie), together with the newspaper Trouw. The person is chosen by a group of journalists and academics. The aim of the initiative is to allow a philosophy heavyweight to speak in the media, to place news events in a broader context. In 2013 Achterhuis was succeeded as Philosopher Laureate by René Gude (Soerabaja, 2 March 1957 – Amsterdam, 13 March 2015).  Publications  *Achterhuis, H.J.

It is now on display in the Hull and East Riding Museum, in Hull. The boat was located and excavated at Hasholme, on the north bank of the River Foulness in the broad river channel. The boat was situated in mostly waterlogged clay (silty-clay, silt, and sand) deposits, which greatly helped the preservation of the timbers. Apart from the boat itself, the excavations did not produce any major associated artifacts, with the exception of a single pottery shard. For dating purposes two techniques, tree-ring dating and radiocarbon 14C/thermoluminescence, were employed. Both methods gave rather comparable results of some time between 750 and 390 BC, which approximately correlates with the later European Iron Age. Based on reconstruction of the landscape around the site, we know that it was dominated by mixed oak, birch, and alder woodland, with some meadows and marshes, as well as many river tributaries and oxbow lakes. Size Side view The University of Hull described it in 2010 as the largest surviving log boat in the UK. \\"Parent log\\" of the boat's hull  The hull of the Hasholme Logboat was made out of an oak tree (Quercus sp.). After all the measurements of the hull were taken, it was estimated that the parent log (oak log the boat was made of) had to be approximately long with at least circumference. Thus the theoretical weight of this log must have been around 28.5 tons but because of the presence of “heart rot” (the natural process of rotting of the interior of the log) these estimates are exaggerated. Based on the size of the oak and other dendro measurements, it was suggested that this kind of tree was between 810 and 880 years old on felling. Oaks of such advanced age and size must have developed a rot known as “brittle heart,” which originates at the base and spreads upward. In the case of Hasholme, this rot spread almost to the very top of the trunk. This meant that even though the hollowing was much easier, the openings on both ends had to be closed and made watertight. It was no accident to select a tree with an extensive rot along its entire length and thus save a tremendous amount of time.  Shape  The Hasholme boat is made of one whole log and is generally log-shaped. It has a flat bottom outboard and also inboard. With the bottom horizontal, the top edge of the sheer-line generally slopes down towards the bow. However, when the boat is afloat the sheer-line becomes horizontal and the bottom gradually slopes upward. Near the bow, the bottom becomes even more rounded and distinctly angled. At the stern, the thickness of the bottom gradually increases to provide sufficient timber to support a transom. The forward upper edges on both sides of the hull are curved in sections and rebates to support extensions in the form of a washstrake. The overall length of the Hasholme logboat is , in maximum beam, and in maximum height.  Bow  The bow section of the Hasholme logboat has a most original design. It is made of two parts, lower and upper bow timbers, which together formed a front enclosure to the log. The lower bow piece is long and thick. On both sides of this timber there are symmetrical rebates which match similar rebates on the main hull as well as series of cleats with transverse holes through which the second and third transverse timbers passed. Those transverse timbers, three in total, not only fasten the lower bow timber to both sides of the hull, but also strengthened and linked the bow section. Forward of the groove for the foremost timber, there were three large vertical holes. The upper bow piece is also around 60 cm long and has a rather complex shape. The bottom section of the upper bow timber has a transverse lip to envelope the leading edge of the lower bow timber, and a series of longitudinal grooves on both sides to fit over the forward ends of the washstrakes of the upper part of the hull. This upper timber was fastened to the lower timber by three vertical tree-nails through corresponding holes in the lower bow. Those tree-nails were approximately long and 0.6 cm (¼ in) thick.  Stern  In general, the stern is at the right angle to the rest of the boat. Approximately forward of the stern, a transverse groove was cut into the bottom and sides to support the transom piece. Forward of the transom several grooves were cut to support transverse shelves, with the most aft shelf covering the transom. Such fitted transoms, which enclose the end of the log, were relatively common in prehistoric logboats. In the case of the Hasholme boat, the rotted heart prevented the construction of an integrated bow and stern, therefore both sections had to be precisely fitted and watertight. The transom itself is 1 m high and 1.08 m in breadth, with rounded lower profile and upper corners cut away. The thickness varies from 25 mm to 90 mm. At the top portion of the transom there are two horizontal holes without any visible wear. Since the original transom weighed between those holes were necessary to place it inside the grooves. Those grooves were later caulked with some mixture of mosses and twigs to make the whole structure watertight. The upper corner of the starboard was cut away and a long tree- nail driven through both sides of the hull. tightening the transom in place. The second function of this tree-nail was to form a tie between both sides of the hull, with similar beam-ties in the bow section of the boat. Fitted transoms are relatively common in pre-historic logboats since it is much easier to construct a transom and make it watertight than to hollow an entire healthy log.  Beam-ties  Beam-ties are transverse timbers fitted athwartship near the stern and their function was to tie the two sides of the hull together. This becomes especially important for logboats without integral ends: that is, with fitted transom and bow. At the bow section, transverse timbers were fitted and these also functioned as beam-ties.  Thickness gauges  At seven points along the length of the boat, thickness gauges were cut, usually at the bottom of the boat. Those holes were bored from outside the log after the outside of the boat was formed. The depth of the holes equated to the required thickness of the boat bottom. In the Hasholme logboat, however, the thickness gauges were bored not at the bottom but at the turn of the bilge, and later corked by oak tree-nails.  Holes near the sheer  There are eleven pairs of equally spaced holes (60 mm in diameter) near the top edge of the sheer line. Close analysis of those holes showed no signs of any intensive wear or fitting marks inside them so their purpose is still a mystery. Possible functions of the holes: * Expansion of the hull: unlikely with Hasholme because it was made of thick oak, which does not expand. The thickness of the sides would not allow expansion. * Holes for lashings during the construction phase. * Cross-beams/ Ribs: also discounted because there is no evidence of any pressure or attachment, nor the need for any. * Carrying- handles: poles could have been passed through those eleven pairs of holes to carry the boat. However, the great weight of the boat would require some 44 men. Nobody knows either if such thin poles would support the weight. * Fastening holes for hides: Holes could be used as some sort of fastening points for hides to keep cargo or men dry during longer expeditions.  Washstrakes  Both sides of the front-upper hull consisted of washstrakes fastened to the hull by a series of tree-nails and rebate grooves. Given the limitations of the log, the washstrakes were probably fitted to the hull to increase the height of the sides near the bow section. They were directly attached to both sides of the hull and fitted inside special grooves in the upper bow timber.  Repairs  It appears that there was a repair done on the portside hull. To patch it, a larger portion of the hull was worked away and a rebate was cut around the edges. Then, a repair patch, some 1.25 m long, was manufactured with similar rebates so both parts would perfectly match. In both parts, the corresponding holes were cut and tree-nails used to fasten them from outside. The other repair, which was done to the starboard inner face of the hull at the stern, was patched by an insertion of a pre-shaped block and fastened by a tree-nail. Based on the analysis of the hull, this repair was initiated as a split stopper. Boring a hole at one end of a split is a recognized way of minimizing a possibility of its spreading. The split was therefore caulked, a section of wood around the transom removed, and the repair block inserted and the transom finished.  Design and build  Based on ethnographic evidence, it is assumed that this kind of log could be cut by the use of some primitive stone or iron tools, but mostly by the use of controlled fire. After the log was cut, it was moved on wooden rollers to the construction site. There work generally had to start from the bottom of the hull and followed by shaping the hull sides. A major requirement while working with such an enormous log must have been to minimize the number of times the log had to be turned over. The first stage would be to externally flatten the bottom and slightly upturn the bow and stern and shape the hull sides, as well as drilling holes for thickness gauges as required. The log would then be rolled over and placed on some sort of timber framework so that access to the bottom was still possible. The next stage would be to work the upper section of the log to produce a sheerline and then work the inside until thickness gauges were reached. In this case, because of the presence of extensive rot, hollowing was probably done by tools rather than by fire. The thickness of the sides would be achieved by eye or by sound, simply by tapping the log. For the bottom, however, the holes left by the thickness gauges were later plugged by tightly fitted and dried oak tree-nails to ensure they were completely watertight upon expansion of the timber. The log would then be finished internally, with all the rebates for fitting bow timbers, transom, washstrakes, and holes along the sheerline cut. As the final step, bow and stern timbers, which were separate pieces from the hull log, would be caulked with moss and the whole structure made watertight. For many measurements, natural units, such as thumb, palm, foot, appear to have been used. For example, the thickness gauges were approximately one thumb in diameter, and the holes near the sheer approximately two thumbs. The overall time to build the Hasholme logboat would directly depend on the number of men involved. Based on other ethnographic evidence it has been estimated that the total time taken would have been roughly one month. Even though building a log-boat was always a communal effort, the complexity of the bow and stern sections suggest that a master boat builder with specialized knowledge must have been employed in this case. There is no evidence to suggest that this boat has ever been fitted with a mast or sail of any kind. The major means of propulsion were either paddles or long poles, while steering was likely to have been done by an oar. Judging from the size of the boat, there were probably nine pairs of paddlers, 18 men in total, and two steersmen. Paddlers would most likely paddle from a standing position, while steersmen would stand on the stern platform. With this arrangement, an important function of the boat would have been to demonstrate the power and high status of the group to their neighbours. Another function of the boat might have been simply to transport cargoes such as iron ore, rocks, timber, grain or meat, among others, with a maximum load as high as . In this case, the arrangement and number of paddlers may have been adjusted to take account of the cargo carried.

The series featured character designs by Yuriko Chiba and music by Toshihiko Takamizawa (of the rock band The Alfee). The series is unusual due to it having an hour time slot per episode (46 minutes of actual episode) rather than the standard half hour time slot. Plot The anime covers a small portion of the life of the timid, shy, Tsubasa Shiina, a grade schooler who is forced to move to Hokkaidō from Tokyo with her father as he pursues his dream of becoming a baker in the aftermath of her mother's death. At her new school, she is so shy and unsociable that her classmates ignore her at best, and abuse her inability to defend herself at worst. Shortly after the two begin to settle in, an alien spaceship comes crashing down to earth in the forest behind her house. Stumbling across the ship with her dog, Tsubasa discovers the pilot, unconscious and wounded, and a monster who is trying to kill him. When the monster attacks, the alien wakes and tries to fight off the monster. Tsubasa, in her fright, runs for the ship to hide from the monster. The monster quickly takes care of the alien, seemingly killing him and in the process releasing him from some sort of transformation, and then tries to reach into the ship to get at Tsubasa. In its effort to reach her, the monster accidentally cracks a mysterious container, the contents of which leak out onto the floor next to Tsubasa. Moments later, the liquid converges upon her and transforms her into what appears to be a young teenage equivalent of the form the man had possessed while fighting the monster. With the aid of this mysterious 'power-up', Tsubasa is able to defeat the monster, though doing so is somewhat accidental on her part. When the battle is over, instead of simply reverting to her usual form, Tsubasa finds that the strange substance has turned into a near-perfect copy of herself on separation. This new girl introduces herself, claiming the name Hikaru. The alien awakens, but does not transform into the appearance he had on Tsubasa's arrival at his ship. Together, all three return to Tsubasa's house and stay the night in her room. The next day the man introduces himself as D.D. -an alien- and explains that he was transporting the seeds of a monster called a Maguar, when suddenly one of the seeds hatched and attacked him, forcing him into a crash landing on Earth. Unfortunately, the Maguar that Tsubasa defeated was only 1 of 6 that he had been transporting, and D.D. explains that the other 5 have escaped the ship and are each scattered somewhere throughout Hokkaidō. He tells the girls that he needs them to help him destroy the remaining 5 Maguar since the atmosphere of the earth has enhanced both Hikaru- who is a form of combat suit known as a Figure- and the Maguar in a similar way, while he waits for reinforcements. To facilitate the problem of suddenly having a twin that no one knows about, D.D. decides to modify the memories of Tsubasa's father, making him believe that he had twin daughters all along, and that Hikaru was simply living elsewhere with an aunt. D.D. proceeds to monitor the Maguar from his ship, while Tsubasa and Hikaru live together at Tsubasa's house, go to school together at Tsubasa's school, fight together as Figure 17 against the Maguar, and essentially become siblings in a more emotional sense. Each episode consists of about 35–40 minutes of Tsubasa's & Hikaru's school life, and is typically concluded by about 5–10 minutes of Maguar fighting. The main point of this series is more about Tsubasa growing up and learning how to cope with life events- such as the loss of her mother and her familiar environment- than the alien-monster fighting which is present throughout each episode. The plot is driven as much by Tsubasa learning from Hikaru and her experiences with her new sister at school as it is by the presence of the Maguar, and there tends to be less cross-interference of mundane and fantastic life than is typical of 'magical girl' type anime.

It was written and directed by Wil Shriner, and produced by New Line Cinema and Walden Media. The film stars Luke Wilson, Logan Lerman, Brie Larson, Tim Blake Nelson, Neil Flynn and Robert Wagner. Filming took place from July to September 2005 in Florida, with additional shooting in California the following January. The project was released on May 5, 2006. Hoot was a box office bomb in its initial theatrical run, and received mixed reviews from critics. The film is about a group of children trying to save a burrowing owl habitat from destruction. Its habitat is located on the intended construction site of a pancake house. The developer of the project intends to proceed regardless of the environmental damage it would cause. Hoot features live burrowing owls and music by Jimmy Buffett. Buffett is also listed as a co- producer, and he played the role of Mr. Ryan, the science teacher. Plot Middle school student Roy A. Eberhardt (Logan Lerman) and his parents (Neil Flynn and Kiersten Warren) have just moved to Coconut Cove, Florida from Montana. Roy is mercilessly teased and bullied at his new school by Dana Matherson (Eric Phillips), until he accidentally breaks Matherson's nose while getting harassed on the school bus and is struggling to get free. As a result, Roy gets suspended from riding the school bus for three days and must write Dana an apology letter as a punishment. Roy slowly becomes friends with Beatrice \\"The Bear\\" Leep (Brie Larson), and her stepbrother \\"Mullet Fingers\\" (Cody Linley). Meanwhile, someone is responsible for sabotage on a local construction site where a \\"Mother Paula's Pancake House\\" restaurant, overseen by corrupt regional manager Chuck Muckle (Clark Gregg), is about to be built. In order to catch the trespassers and prevent further vandalism, Officer David Delinko (Luke Wilson) has parked his police cruiser on the building site. Delinko falls asleep and an unknown prankster vandalizes the car by spray painting its windows black. The next day at breakfast, Roy and his parents read about the spray painted police car. The police chief then gives Delinko a small police scooter to replace the vandalized cruiser. Soon, Roy learns that in order to build the pancake house, they must first destroy the burrowing owls living on site. Mullet Fingers has been covertly pulling pranks to stop construction (including the tagging of Delinko's car), but Beatrice must take Roy into their confidence when he is badly bitten by guard dogs. Roy joins their crusade to save the endangered owls. Leroy \\"Curly\\" Branitt (Tim Blake Nelson), the beleaguered construction foreman, is trying to keep the construction schedule going, despite the presence of the owls, due to daily abuse from Muckle over the phone, and later in person. In the end, the trio reveals to Delinko and the rest of the town that there are burrowing owls on the lot. They then manage to get everyone to be quiet long enough for the owls to emerge. As Muckle is fired from his job and arrested for his actions, Kimberly (Jessica Cauffiel), the actress who plays Mother Paula, offers Coconut Cove the site as an owl preserve in the interest of damage control. Ultimately Roy's parents decide to stay in Florida, Officer Delinko finally gets promoted to detective and gets an unmarked patrol car (until he accidentally backed it off a fishing pier), Dana is sent off to military school where he gets tortured by his drill sergeant, Muckle does community service for 90 days (But then gets sentenced to another 30 days by the judge due to lying down on the job after getting hit in the head with a coconut), the land becomes donated and turned into an animal sanctuary and the owls continue to live there, Curly and Kimberly leave Mother Paula's Pancake House to raise dogs, and Roy continues to be friends with Beatrice and Mullet Fingers.

Markward von Annweiler (died 1202) was Imperial Seneschal and Regent of the Kingdom of Sicily. Biography Markward was a ministerialis, that is, he came not from the free nobility, but from a class of unfree knights and administrators whose purpose was to serve loyally the Imperial administration in any capacity. During the reign of the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, Markward became one of the most important figures in the administration. Markward can be proved at the latest since the Diet of Pentecost. From 1184, Markward served Barbarossa's son Henry VI in Italy. Henry appointed him Margrave of Ancona and Count of Abruzzo, placing him in a highly strategic position in north-central Italy. After the death of Henry, Markward at first supported his widow Constance of Sicily, but later found himself her enemy. He had been excommunicated by Popes Celestine III and Innocent III, who were trying to take over lands in central Italy. Markward stayed in Italy, and became a supporter of Philip of Swabia, the brother of Henry. Markward's political and military activities caused great problems for the Popes, whose control of Sicily gradually weakened. Two years after Constance's death (1198), Philip gave Markward the lordship of Palermo, where the under-age heir, the future Emperor Frederick II, was resident. Despite the opposition of Innocent III, Markward became Guardian of Frederick II and Regent of Sicily. However, Markward died within a few years. He was succeeded in Palermo by William of Capparone.

Chilton was educated at Manchester Grammar School and Durham University where he won the British Universities tournament in 1997. The same year he made his debut for Lancashire, aged 20. Chilton has been compared in batting style to fellow Manchester Grammar School student and former Lancashire and England batsman John Crawley. Chilton began the 2002 season as one half of Lancashire's first-choice opening partnership with Alec Swann who joined the club in the off-season. For most of the season Chilton struggled for runs in the County Championship, although he was more successful in one-day cricket, scoring two hundreds in the Benson & Hedges Cup. In September 2002, towards the end of the season, Chilton was awarded his county cap by Lancashire. He was appointed Lancashire captain when Warren Hegg resigned in September 2004 after relegation to County Championship Division Two. Chilton must consider the 2005 season, his first as Lancashire skipper, as a minor success after leading the county to promotion in the Championship and to the final of the Twenty20 Cup before losing out to Somerset Sabres at The Oval. Lancashire also progressed to the semi-final of the Benson & Hedges Cup where they lost to Warwickshire. Chilton was close to tears after the match, which was the club's seventh defeat in a semi-final in six years. The 2007 County Championship was closely contested and going into the final round of matches, Lancashire were at the top of the table. A 24-run defeat to Surrey in their final fixture saw Lancashire finish as runners-up. Chilton was in tears afterwards and said \\"I'm extremely proud of what our guys have achieved though. As captain I'm privileged to have seen the efforts they have put in. To get close to our target was a phenomenal effort but the lads are just broken. Our players have risen to an almighty challenge and to come so close is an enormous effort\\". At the end of the season, Chilton resigned as Lancashire captain after three years in the position, citing reasons of form. He had managed 616 runs in the Championship that year at an average of 28.00. Although the team only won one trophy under Chilton's leadership, they came close on numerous occasions, narrowly missing out on two County Championship titles, two Twenty20 cups, and the C&G; Trophy. Having relinquished the captaincy, Chilton spent most of the 2008 season in Lancashire's Second XI, struggling for form and trying to force his way back into the First team. In stark contrast, in 2009 he was voted Lancashire's Player of the Year. After retirement, Chilton returned to Manchester Grammar where he took the position of director of cricket. Chilton was awarded a benefit season for 2011. That year Lancashire won the County Championship for the first time since they shared the title in 1950, and their first outright win since 1934. Chilton contributed 478 runs in 13 Championship matches that season at an average of 22.76. At the end of the 2011 season he announced his retirement from playing cricket.

Born around 1842 to an arabized Nubian family in Halfaya Al-Muluk, a suburb of Khartoum, he first served with the irregular Egyptian cavalry in the Ethiopian campaign, during which he was wounded. When Rabih left the army in 1860s, he became the principal lieutenant of the Sudanese slaveholder Sebehr Rahma.  Lieutenant of al-Zubayr (1870–1879)  In the 19th century, Khartoum had become a very important Arab slave market, supplied through companies of Khartumi established in the region of Bahr el Ghazal, where they resided in zarības (), thornbush-fortified bases kept by bāzinqirs (firearm-equipped slave soldiers). The warlord and slaveholder al-Zubayr Rahma Mansur assumed control of the region's zaribas, and was nominated in 1872 pasha and governor of Bahr el Ghazal for the khedive Isma'il, ruler of Egypt. Rabih, who was possibly a relative of al-Zubayr, was the chief lieutenant of the pasha. In 1874, al-Zubayr conquered the Sultanate of Darfur. In 1876, he went to Cairo to request the khedive to officially sanction his position in Darfur, but was instead imprisoned. This caused in 1878 the revolt of al-Zubayr's son, Suleyman, and of his lieutenants, like Rabih. In reaction the governor-general of Sudan, Charles George Gordon, made Romolo Gessi governor of Bahr el Ghazal, and sent him to suppress the rebellion; Suleyman surrendered July 15, 1879, and was executed. Rabih instead is said to have left Suleyman the day before he surrendered, but Gessi reports instead that he had retreated already in June, after having suffered heavy losses. Warlord (1879-1890) To escape from Egypt, Rabih left the Bahr el Ghazal, heading south with 700–800 bazingiris and 400 rifles. Using the tactics of the Khartumi, in the 1880s he carved out a kingdom between the basins of the Nile and the Ubangi, in the country of Kreich and Dar Benda, south of Ouaddai, a region he utterly devastated. In 1885, he attempted to return in Sudan following the invitation of the Mahdi Muhammad Ahmad, who had taken Khartoum from Egypt. The Mahdi had sent as ambassadors Zin el-Abeddin and Jabar, and Rabih followed them back to Darfur, proposing to meet the Mahdi at Omdurman; but when he learned of a plot to kill him, he changed his mind and returned to Chad. In 1887, Rabih's forces invaded Darfur, recruited bazingirs, and settled down in Dar Kouti; however, his campaign against the aguid Salamat Cherif ed-Din, commander of the sultan of Ouaddai's troops, failed. In 1890, he attacked the Muslim chief Kobur in the north of Oubangui-Chari, deposed him and established in his place his nephew Mahdi al-Senoussi, on whom he imposed his suzerainty. This alliance was sealed by the marriage of Khadija, daughter of Al-Mahdi al-Senoussi, with Rabih's son Fadlallah. Together Mohammed and Rabih attacked Dar Runga, Kreich, Goula and then Banda Ngao.  First confrontations with France (1891–1893)  Mohammed al-Senoussi's alliance with Rabih worried the colonial powers, especially France that was considering taking control of central Africa. Mohammed al-Senoussi remained faithful to Rabih and in 1891 killed the French Paul Crampel in Dar Banda. Rabih recovered the expedition's weapons. In the south-east of Lake Chad, he attacked the Baguirmi Kingdom in 1892, blaming the Mbang (king) Abd ar Rahman Gwaranga for having signed a protectorate with the French. Gwaranga was besieged for three to five months in Manjaffa, and was later forced to leave his capital, which was completely destroyed in March 1893.  Conquest of Borno (1893)  Statue of Rabih at the National Museum Maiduguri, Borno, Nigeria In 1893, Rabih also turned his attentions to the Borno Empire of Shehu (king) Ashimi of Borno. Borno was a Sahelian Kingdom that traced its origins back to the Middle Ages. That year, the empire consisted of 80,000 soldiers, mostly slaves commanded by slaves, and was in full decline. On the road to Borno, Rabih made prisoner the sultan of Karnak Logone, whose capital promptly opened its doors to his host. Shehu Ashimi of Borno sent 15,000 men to confront Rabih; the latter routed them in May or September 1893 first at Am Hobbio (south of Dekoa) and then at Legaroua with only 2,000 horse. Ashimi fled north of the Komadougou Yobe from where he may have tried to negotiate with Rabih; but he was assassinated at the instigation of his nephew Kyari, who then became shehu and decided to fight Rabih. Rabih met Kyari at Gashegar, a two days' walk from Kukawa, the capital of Borno; Kiyari defeated Rabih and captured his camp. The following day Rabih gathered his forces, and ordered 100 lashes be given to all his bannermen, including his own favored son Fadlallah. Only Boubakar, who had fought bravely, was spared. Then he ordered a victorious counter-offensive; Kyari, who had refused to flee, was captured and beheaded. As for the capital city, Kukawa, it was plundered and razed to the ground. Rabih made Dikwa his capital, and there built a palace which was to win later the admiration of the French governor Émile Gentil. Local legend says that during construction there was a shortage of water, and blood was substituted to mix with sand for its walls.  Borno's Lord (1893–1900)  Wanting to modernize his army, Rabih attempted in 1895 to make an accord with British Royal Niger Company in Yola and Ibi so to obtain gunpowder and ammunition, but without success. He started confronting the British in 1896 and the following year even started marching on Kano, while his vassal Muhammad al-Senussi in Dar al Kuti founded a fortified capital, Ndele, between Bahr Aouk and the Ubangi River, which the Senussites held until 1911. For seven years Rabih was shehu of the Borno Empire, and spent much effort to reinvigorate a decadent empire that had until then maintained the same feudal structures it had in the 16th century. Rabih kept the vassal sultans in place, but subjected them to his lieutenants, mostly Arab Sudanese like him. He promulgated a legal code based on the sharia, rationalized taxation through the creation of a budget, imposed on Borno a military dictatorship, which aroused the attention of the colonial powers. Émile Gentil was to speak of Rabih's reforms in Borno with a certain degree of interest; they would later inspire him in organizing the territory of Chad. Much is told about his brutality (for example, he once had one of his concubines executed because she kept a talisman designed to obtain Rabih's love, and with her the marabout that had deciphered the talisman); or about the evenings he passed listening to Ali, the poet who sang his exploits. More importantly, Rabih launched a regular series of razzias to plunder and capture slaves; this was a return to the traditional activity of the sultans of Borno, which had been described in 1526 by Leo Africanus. It is estimated that 1,500–2,000 slaves were exported every year by his vassal Mahdi as-Senoussi, excluding the deaths, casualties, and other losses he inflicted. The totals for Rabah must have been much higher.  Direct conflict with the French (1899–1900)  One of Rabih's cannons captured by the French In 1899 Rabah had at his disposal 10,000 men among infantry and cavalry, all provided with rifles (mostly obsolete, except for 400 rifles of newer make), plus a great number of auxiliaries equipped with spears or bows. He kept garrisons at Baggara and Karnak Logone. In 1899, Rabih received in Dekoa the French explorer Ferdinand de Béhagle. The talks between them degenerated, and Béhagle was arrested. On July 17, Lieutenant Bretonnet, who had been sent by France against Rabih, was killed with most of his men at Togbao, at the edge of the Chari River, in present-day Sarh. Rabih gained three cannons from this victory (which the French recaptured at Kousséri) and ordered his son Fadlallah, who he had left in Dikoa, to hang Béhagle. In response, a French column proceeding from Gabon and led by Émile Gentil, supported by the steamboat Leon Blot, confronted Rabih at Kouno at the end of the year. Even if the French were repulsed with losses, this did not prevent them from continuing and taking Kousséri. Here, they combined with the Lamy column, which had arrived from Algeria, and the Joalland-Meynier column, which had marched from Niger. Lamy assumed command of the combined forces. The final showdown between Rabih and the French took place on April 22, 1900. The French forces disposed of 700 men, plus the 600 riflemen and 200 cavalry provided by the allied Baguirmians. Leaving Kousséri in three columns, the French attacked Rabih's camp. Although the commander Lamy was killed in the ensuing battle, Rabih's forces were overwhelmed and, while fleeing across the Chari River, Rabih was killed. With Rabih's defeat, his empire rapidly disintegrated. A year later his son Fadlallah was defeated and killed. All Rabih's territories fell into French hands, except for Borno which went to Britain.

Written by Russell Smith and directed by John T. Kretchmer, the episode premiered on UPN on December 7, 2005. The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life as a high school student while moonlighting as a private detective. In this episode, Veronica serves on a jury in the trial of two '09er boys in the assault of a woman. Meanwhile, Keith (Enrico Colantoni) investigates when the Aaron Echolls-Lilly Kane sex tapes are stolen.  Synopsis  It is almost Christmas break at Neptune high. Veronica tells Duncan (Teddy Dunn) that Meg (Alona Tal) is pregnant, and Duncan says that he already knew because of the letter he got previously. Dick (Ryan Hansen) comes up and invites Veronica and Duncan to a party while informing them that Meg has woken up. Veronica decides to sneak into the hospital. Woody Goodman (Steve Guttenberg) tells Keith that someone has stolen the Lilly Kane-Aaron Echolls sex tapes. Keith agrees to help him with the case. Veronica and Duncan visit Meg, who talks to them. Meg says that her parents want to give the child up for adoption and don't want Duncan to have a say in the matter. After Duncan leaves, Meg asks Veronica to prevent the adoption if \\"anything happens to\\" her. That night, Veronica learns that she has jury duty. Veronica is voted jury foreman. Keith talks to Sheriff Lamb, who says that the Sheriff's department is secure. One member of the jury gives the facts of the case—two men are charged in the assault of a woman named Anissa. The prosecution and defendant have very different accounts of the incident. Veronica takes a vote, and the vote is 11 innocent, 1 guilty. Keith interrogates another member of the Sheriff's department but gets nowhere. The holdout identifies herself and makes the other jurors question their votes. Keith talks to Leo D'Amato (Max Greenfield), who says that someone probably sold the tapes. Keith talks to an acquaintance in journalism, who agrees to contact the tabloids. One of the bikers comes up to Veronica and threatens her about the jury case. The holdout makes more deductions that support the guilty vote. Keith interrogates Logan before the journalism insider tells him that the sex tapes are on the open market for $500,000. The jurors take another vote, and another juror and Veronica have switched over to guilty. Veronica decorates the apartment for Keith. Veronica finds out that Anissa's \\"pimp\\" was actually a sports star. Veronica ties up some loose ends that show that the defendants are guilty. However, one juror refuses to change his vote no matter what. The entire Sheriff's department received an email about the sex tapes. Logan (Jason Dohring) has the tapes and is watching them, crying. Afterwards, Logan burns the tapes. Keith comes in and finds out that Logan bought the tapes. The remaining juror changes his vote, believing that the defendants will appeal and win. After, one of the jurors invites Veronica to Hearst College. Veronica finds that her car is vandalized. Leo actually stole the tapes in order to pay for his sister with Down syndrome to go to a private school. Leo knowingly sent the tapes to Logan. Later, Keith tells Veronica that Meg has died, but her baby daughter has survived. On New Years' Eve, Veronica hears a knock on the door, and Wallace (Percy Daggs III) appears. They spend New Years' Eve together.  Cultural references  The following cultural references are made in the episode: *The plot-line involving disagreement among the jury is based on the plot of Twelve Angry Men. *Veronica says \\"God bless us, every one,\\" a famous line said by Tiny Tim in A Christmas Carol. *Logan says that he's saved the Daria marathon. *Logan says a famous line spoken by Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire. *Veronica and Keith watch the Times Square Ball on New Years' Eve.  Arc significance  *The Aaron Echolls-Lilly Kane sex tapes are stolen from the evidence locker by Leo D'Amato. Instead of selling them to the tabloids, Leo sells them to Logan, who erases them. *The letter Duncan found was to Meg's aunt. Meg was going to go there to have the baby until the bus crash. *Meg is awake and apologizes to Veronica. She then tells her that if anything happens to her she doesn't want her parents to get control of her baby. *Meg dies from a blood clot, but her baby lives. *Wallace returns from Chicago after an absence of four episodes.  Music  The following music can be heard in the episode: *\\"The Christmas Song\\" by The King Cole Trio *\\"Edge of the Ocean\\" by Ivy *\\"Diamond In the Mine\\" by Holidays on Ice  Production  Recurring character Meg Manning (Alona Tal, pictured) dies in \\"One Angry Veronica\\". Except for a brief cameo in a dream sequence in \\"I Am God\\", this would be her final appearance on the show. \\"One Angry Veronica\\" was written by Russell Smith and directed by John T. Kretchmer, marking Smith's second and final writing credit for the show (after writing the teleplay for \\"Drinking the Kool-Aid\\") as well as Kretchmer's sixth directing credit for the show. The episode features the first reference on the show to Hearst College, the main location for the show's third season of the show. Despite being credited, Weevil (Francis Capra), Cassidy Casablancas (Kyle Gallner), and Jackie (Tessa Thompson) do not appear in \\"One Angry Veronica\\". In the episode, the character of Meg Manning (Alona Tal) dies while giving birth to her and Duncan's daughter. Tal appeared in 8 episodes previously. Except for a small cameo in \\"I Am God\\", this would be her last appearance in the series. On the departure of Meg, Rob Thomas commented, \\"\\"The intention was always to get Meg to survive long enough to give birth. What we were really interested in was having that baby. So for our storytelling, it's less about wanting to kill Meg [and more about] wanting to have this baby that's in jeopardy, that's Duncan's baby, that brings a point of crisis with Duncan and Veronica.\\" In addition, the character of Wallace Fennel (Percy Daggs III) returns after an absence of four episodes. The episode's title refers to Twelve Angry Men and its film adaptation. Similarly to both, \\"One Angry Veronica\\" depicts a jury deliberating on and eventually changing its verdict. The episode would also be the final episode of the series to air in 2005.  Reception  = Ratings = In its original broadcast, \\"One Angry Veronica\\" received 3.42 million viewers, marking a sharp increase in 600,000 viewers from \\"My Mother, the Fiend.\\" At the time of its airing, the episode was the highest-rated episode of the series, surpassing the season premiere \\"Normal Is the Watchword\\". This ratings high would be broken roughly a season later, with \\"Spit & Eggs\\". = Reviews = The episode received a polarized reaction from both critics and fans. Television Without Pity gave the episode a \\"C+,\\" its lowest rating for the series thus far. Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, gave a fairly negative review, saying that \\"those last three twists at the end put it at a whole different, odd, bad level.\\" The reviewer criticized the out-of-the-blue nature of the plot twists involving Meg and Leo. \\"Leo, like Meg, is a character we have history with, suddenly wiped away by something that takes place essentially off-screen. […] It doesn't feel like a betrayal from the character—it feels like a betrayal from the author.\\" On the other hand, Price Peterson, writing for TV.com, gave a more positive review, saying that \\"the episode was surprising (and surprisingly heartbreaking!). Also I'm an absolute sucker for Christmas episodes of any show.\\" The episode is controversial among fans, with The A.V. Club even comparing it to the episode \\"Seeing Red\\" of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

It is situated in a half square-mile valley bordered by the Arroyo Seco and the historic 110 freeway to the west, El Sereno to the south, and South Pasadena to the north and east. The community has been part of Los Angeles since 1912, but has retained its own unique identity. It is primarily a residential community, with a small business district in the center, one elementary school, a charter high school, two city parks, and an off-leash dog park opened in 2005. History Hermon was established in 1903, when the Free Methodist church group obtained the isolated valley from owner Ralph Rogers to establish a school. He provided an additional one hundred building lots to sell for operating funds. Around the campus was organized the community of Hermon named after the biblical Mt. Hermon at the headwaters of the River Jordan., largely populated by families whose children attended the school. The school grew to become Los Angeles Pacific College in 1934, then merged with Azusa College in the mid-1960s to become Azusa Pacific University. Up until 2003, the school campus held a private college prep high school, Pacific Christian. It is now owned by Bethesda Christian University and has been leased to Los Angeles College Prep Academy (LACPA) Los Angeles College Prep Academy -- formerly L.A. International Charter High School. Better links were established between Hermon and the rest of Los Angeles with the construction of a bridge across the Arroyo Seco at Avenue 60 in 1926, the Monterey Road pass through Walnut Hill to the south in 1930, and the Hermon Avenue bridge (renamed Via Marisol, over the objections of many community members, by the late Los Angeles City Council member Art Snyder in 1978 to honor his young daughter, Erin Marisol Snyder) to the west in 1939. In the 117 years since its inception, the neighborhood has grown from 100 small lots into a community of approximately 3,500 residents. The Hermon Neighborhood Council was certified in May 2017 as the 97th and smallest Los Angeles City neighborhood advisory board (Neighborhood councils of Los Angeles).

Fejér was born Weisz Leopold, and changed to the Hungarian name FejérWeiss in German means \\"white\\", fejér is archaic spelling in Hungarian for \\"white\\". Biography around 1900. Biography Fejér studied mathematics and physics at the University of Budapest and at the University of Berlin, where he was taught by Hermann Schwarz. In 1902 he earned his doctorate from University of Budapest (today Eötvös Loránd University). From 1902 to 1905 Fejér taught there and from 1905 until 1911 he taught at Franz Joseph University in Kolozsvár in Austria- Hungary (now Cluj-Napoca in Romania). In 1911 Fejér was appointed to the chair of mathematics at the University of Budapest and he held that post until his death. He was elected corresponding member (1908), member (1930) of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. During his period in the chair at Budapest Fejér led a highly successful Hungarian school of analysis. He was the thesis advisor of mathematicians such as John von Neumann, Paul Erdős, George Pólya and Pál Turán. Lipót Fejér is buried in Kerepesi Cemetery in Budapest. Fejér's research concentrated on harmonic analysis and, in particular, Fourier series. Fejér collaborated to produce important papers, one with Carathéodory on entire functions in 1907 and another major work with Frigyes Riesz in 1922 on conformal mappings (specifically, a short proof of the Riemann mapping theorem).  Pólya on Fejér  Pólya writes the following about Fejér, telling us much about his personality: > He had artistic tastes. He deeply loved music and was a good pianist. He > liked a well-turned phrase. 'As to earning a living', he said, 'a > professor's salary is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition.' Once he > was very angry with a colleague who happened to be a topologist, and > explaining the case at length he wound up by declaring '... and what he is > saying is a topological mapping of the truth'. > > He had a quick eye for foibles and miseries; in seemingly dull situations > he noticed points that were unexpectedly funny or unexpectedly pathetic. He > carefully cultivated his talent of raconteur; when he told, with his > characteristic gestures, of the little shortcomings of a certain great > mathematician, he was irresistible. The hours spent in continental coffee > houses with Fejér discussing mathematics and telling stories are a cherished > recollection for many of us. Fejér presented his mathematical remarks with > the same verve as his stories, and this may have helped him in winning the > lasting interest of so many younger men in his problems. Lipót Fejér, (standing to the right) with Greek mathematician Constantin Carathéodory (1873-1950) (left) In the same article Pólya writes about Fejér's style of mathematics: > Fejér talked about a paper he was about to write up.

He was the author of two antiquarian works published after his death: Antiquitates Rutupinae (‘Antiquities of Richborough’) and Antiquitates S. Edmundi Burgi ad Annum MCCLXXII Perductae (‘Antiquities of St. Edmundsbury to 1272’). John Battely was the brother of Nicholas Battely, who edited William Somner’s Cantuaria sacra, the first account of the antiquities of Canterbury. John Battely was born on 11 November 1646 in the Parish of St. James, Bury St. Edmunds. His father, Nicholas Battely, was an apothecary. After his education at the King Edward VI Grammar School, Bury St. Edmunds, he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge in 1662 (B.A. 1665–6; Fellow, 1668; M.A. 1669; D.D. 1684). He was ordained at Ely in 1675 and became domestic chaplain to Archbishop Sancroft and subsequently to Archbishop Tillotson.C. S. Knighton, ‘Batteley, John (bap. 1646, d. 1708)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 , accessed 9 Jan 2010 Battely was Rector of Hunton in Norfolk 1682–1684, and on 19 November 1684 he became Rector of Adisham in Kent. It was probably at this time that Battely began his research at Richborough Castle. In 1687, however, Battely returned to East Anglia. He was made Archdeacon of Suffolk, which entitled him to a stall at Norwich Cathedral and gave him nominal pastoral oversight of his native county. He was installed as Archdeacon of Canterbury on 24 March 1688 and became Master of the Eastbridge Hospital in the same year. On 5 November 1688 (the same day William of Orange landed at Torbay), he became a canon of Canterbury Cathedral (Stall I), and on 10 November he subscribed to the Articles of Religion. John Battely died on 10 October 1708 and his papers were inherited by his nephew Oliver Battely. In 1711 Oliver published the work on Richborough, before co-operating with Sir James Burrough to print the work on Bury St. Edmunds in 1745.  Sources  *John Battely (ed.

This game was also ported by Kuusou Kagaku to the PlayStation and Sega Saturn for Psikyo and re-released by Success in 2000. Agetec released Strikers 1945 II for the PlayStation in North America under the title Strikers 1945 in 2001, and Midas Games released it in Europe as a budget title in 2003. The game was also included in Psikyo Shooting Collection Vol. 1: Strikers 1945 I&II; by Taito for PlayStation 2, later was released as a downloadable title for PlayStation Network by GungHo Online Entertainment, and finally for Android and iOS by Mobirix (as STRIKERS 1945-2). Also, after S&C; Entertainment developed another version, they released it on Google Play, with the plane fire button removed, making it autofire and only tap the bomb and charge icons. Gameplay P-38 Lightning engaging in battle with Huge Flying Boat Syumi Type-0. As in Strikers 1945, the player chooses one of six World War II-era fighter planes, then uses machine guns and bombs to fight through eight stages (the first four stages being in random order and the latter four stages in linear fashion). Once the game is beaten, a report showing how well the player did is displayed, and the game 'loops' with the difficulty much higher. Each game begins with three lives, and an extend is earned at 600,000. When all lives are lost, the option to continue is given but the score is reset. In the console versions, from the fifth stage onwards, in addition to the score being reset, the player must also replay the stage where they lost all their lives from the beginning. Plot Continuing where the last game ended, the forces of C.A.N.Y. have been demolished by the Strikers. However, a faction known as the F.G.R. now has the C.A.N.Y. technology and plans to initiate global warfare with massive mecha technology. Once again, the Strikers are called into action to save the world. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Strikers 1945 II on their November 15, 1997 issue as being the sixth most- successful arcade game of the year. Strikers 1945 II was mostly well received. Three reviewers from the Japanese Sega Saturn Magazine gave the version for this system the scores of 9-8-8/10, while French magazine Consoles + rated both the Saturn and PlayStation ports an 88%. Similarly, the original arcade version received a score of 88% from French magazine Player One. On the other hand, Miguel Lopez from GameSpot gave the PlayStation release only a 5.8/10, recommending it just for the fans of the genre. IGN's David Smith voiced a similar opinion, but nevertheless gave it a \\"good\\" score of 7.3/10. Chester Barber reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for Next Generation, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \\"Strikers is a decent shooter of a type that's all but dead. Unfortunately, it hasn't aged well over the years, though if you're into old games, this would be worth a rental.\\" References External links * at Nintendo Store *STRIKERS 1945-2 at Google Play *STRIKERS 1945-2 at App Store * *Strikers 1945 II at MobyGames *Strikers 1945 II at World of Arcades *Strikers 1945 II at Sega Retro Category:1997 video games Category:Alternate history video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Arcade games Category:IOS games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Psikyo games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Sega Saturn games Category:Vertically scrolling shooters Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Video games set in 1945 Category:Video games set in Japan Category:Video games set in Greenland Category:Video games set in Arizona Category:Video games set in France Category:Video games set in Namibia Category:Video games set in Brazil Category:World War II video games ","title":"Strikers 1945 II"},{"id":"3934410","text":"William James Stairs (born September 30, 1956) is a Canadian politician.

They were propitiated in order to avoid those ills, that carried off so many children before they reached adulthood.http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/india/jagat/jagat13.html They come to play a protective role in later mythology, although some of their inauspicious and wild characteristics still persist in these accounts.Kinsley, David. Hindu Goddesses: Visions of the Divine Feminine in Hindu Religious Tradition. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1988. p.151 Thus, they represent the prodigiously fecund aspect of nature as well as its destructive force aspect.Jain p.162 In the Brihat-Samhita, Varahamihira says that \\"Mothers are to be made with cognizance of (different major Hindu) gods corresponding to their names.\\"Brhatsamhita, Ch.57, v.56. They are associated with these gods as their spouses or their energies (Shaktis). Originally believed to be a personification of the seven stars of the star cluster the Pleiades, they became quite popular by the seventh century and a standard feature of goddess temples from the ninth century onwards.Wangu Glossary p.187 Origins and development upright According to Jagdish Narain Tiwari and Dilip Chakravati, the Matrikas were existent as early as the Vedic period and the Indus Valley civilization. Seals with rows of seven feminine deities or priestesses are cited as evidence for the theory.Jagdish Narain Tiwari, \\"Studies in Goddess Cults in Northern India, with Reference to the First Seven Centuries AD\\" p.215-244; as referred in Kinsley p.151Dilip Chakravati in Archaeology and World Religion By Timothy Insoll, Published 2001, Routledge, , pp.42–44 The Rigveda (IX 102.4) speaks of a group of seven Mothers who control the preparation of Soma, but the earliest clear description appears in select chapters of the epic Mahabharata dated to 1st century AD.Kinsley p.151Pal in Singh p.1836 Wangu believes that Matrika description in Mahabharata is rooted in the group of seven females depicted on Indus valley seals. It was assumed that the people locally worshipped these goddesses, such an example is also described in Zimmer Heinrich book The Art Of Indian Asia, about the seven shrines of seven Mother Goddesses worshipped locally. By the fifth century, all these goddesses were incorporated in mainstream orthodox Hinduism as Tantric deities.Zimmer Heinrich, 1960,2001 The Art Of Indian Asia, Its Mythology and Transformations.Motilal Banarsidas Publication. New Delhi (Page B4C,257,135)Harper in Harper and Brown, p.48 David Kinsley proposes that the Matrikas may be non-Aryan or at least non-Brahmanical (orthodox Hinduism), local village goddesses, who were being assimilated in the mainstream. He cites two reasons for his assertion: their description in Mahabharata as dark in colour, speaking foreign languages and living in \\"peripheral areas\\" and their association with non-Brahmanical god Skanda and his father, Shiva, who though Vedic has non-Brahmanical attributes.Kinsley, Hindu Goddesses, p.155 Sara L. Schastok suggests that the Matrikas maybe inspired by the concept of Yakshas, who are associated with Skanda and Kubera – both are often portrayed with the Matrikas.Schastok, Sara L. The Śamalājī Sculptures and Sixth-Century Art in Western India. Leiden: Brill, 1985. pp.58–60 In contrast to Indus valley origins theory, Bhattacharyya notes: > The cult of the Female Principle was a major aspect of Dravidian religion, > The concept of Shakti was an integral part of their religion [...] The cult > of the Sapta Matrika, or Seven Divine Mothers, which is an integral part of > the Shakta religion, may be of Dravidian inspiration.Bhattacharyya, N. N., > History of the Sakta Religion, Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers Pvt. Ltd. > (New Delhi, 1974, 2d ed. 1996). The Sapta-Matrikas were earlier connected with Skanda (Kumara) and in later times, associated with the sect of Shiva himself. During the Kushana period (1st to 3rd century), the sculptural images of the matrikas first appear in stone. The Kushana images merged from the belief in Balagraha (lit \\"destroyers of children\\") worship related to conception, birth, diseases and protection of children. The Balagraha tradition included the worship of the infant Skanda with the Matrikas. The goddesses were considered as personifications of perils, related to children and thus, were pacified by worship. The Kushana images emphasize the maternal as well as destructive characteristics of the Matrikas through their emblems and weapons. They appear to be an undifferentiated sculptural group but develop in standard and complex iconographic representation during the following Gupta period.Wangu pp.58–59 In the Gupta period (3rd to 6th century A.D.), folk images of Matrikas became important in villages.Wangu p.67 The diverse folk goddesses of the soldiers like Matrikas were acknowledged by the Gupta rulers and their images were carved on royal monuments in order to strengthen the loyalty and adherence of the armed forces.Wangu p. 68 The Gupta kings Skandagupta and Kumaragupta I (c. second half of fifth century) made Skanda (Kumara) their model and elevated the position of Skanda's foster mothers, the Matrikas from a cluster of folk goddesses to court goddesses.Wangu p.76 Since the fourth century, Parhari, Madhya Pradesh had a rock-cut shrine been solely devoted to the Sapta Matrika.Berkson p.212 The Western Ganga Dynasty (350–1000 CE) kings of Karnataka built many Hindu temples along with saptamatrika carvings p51 and memorials, containing sculptural details of saptamatrikas.Kamath (2001), p52 The evidence of Matrika sculptures is further pronounced in the Gurjara–Patiharas (8th to 10th century A.D.) and Chandella period (8th to 12th century A.D.). The Chalukyas claimed to have been nursed by the Sapta Matrikas. It was a popular practice to link South Indian royal family lineage to a Northern kingdom in ancient times.Dr. Suryanath U. Kamath (2001), A Concise History of Karnataka from pre-historic times to the present, Jupiter books, MCC (Reprinted 2002), p60 During the Chalukya period (11th to 13th century), all Matrikas continued to figure among the deity sculptures of this period. The Kadambas and Early Chalukyas from the fifth century praise the Matrikas in their preambles, as giver of powers to defeat enemies.Lorenzen, David in Harper and Brown, p.29Harper in Harper and Brown, p.121 In most of the relevant texts, their exact number has not been specified, but gradually their number and names became increasingly crystallized and seven goddesses were identified as matrikas, albeit some references indicate eight or even sixteen Matrikas.Kinsley p.156 Laura K. Amazzone cites: > The inconsistency in the number of Matrikas found in the valley [Indus] > today (seven, eight, or nine) possibly reflects the localization of > goddesses [.] Although the Matrikas are mostly grouped as seven goddesses > over the rest of the Indian Subcontinent, an eighth Matrikas has sometimes > been added in Nepal to represent the eight cardinal directions.

Devi bhagwatam mentions 2 other Matrikas Varuni(shakti of Varuna) and Kauberi (shakti of Kubera).Pal in Singh p.1846 Legends 9th–10th century granite Chola statue of Matrika Maheshvari, seen with a trident in a hand, adorned by serpent ornaments and her vahana (mount), the bull Nandi is seen on her seat — Musée Guimet, Paris. There are several Puranic texts related to the origin of Matrikas. Matsya Purana, Vamana Purana, Varaha Purana, Kurma Purana and the Suprabhedagama contain references to Matrikas, and this asserts their antiquity.The stories are quoted in (Rao, T.A. Gopinatha, Elements of Hindu Iconography, Vol.I, Part-II, 2nd Edition, Indological Book House, Varanasi, 1971, pp.379–383). According to the Shumbha-Nishumbha story of Devi Mahatmya, Matrikas appear as Shaktis from the bodies of the gods – Brahma, Shiva, Skanda, Vishnu, Indra;Kinsley p. 156, Devi Mahatmya verses 8.11–20 having form of each, approached Chandika (identified with Devi) with whatever form, ornaments and vehicle the god possessed. In that form, they slaughter the demon army.Kinsley p. 156, Devi Mahatmya verses 8.38, 44, 49, 62 Thus, the Matrikas are goddesses of the battlefield. They are described as assistants of Durga having sinister as well as propitious characteristics. After the battle, the Matrikas dance drunk with their victim's blood.Kinsley p. 156, Devi Mahatmya verses 8.62 This description is repeated with little variation in Devi Bhagavata Purana.Kinsley p. 156, verses 5.28–29 and It names 10 goddesses and then says that some shaktis of other gods also came to battle. and Vamana Purana.Kinsley p. 156, verses 30 The Devi-Bhagavata Purana mentions three other goddesses, Shaktis of other gods in addition to Saptamatrikas making a group of 10 Matrikas.Kinsley p.242 According to latter episode of Devi Mahatmya, Durga created Matrikas from herself and with their help slaughtered the demon army. In this version, Kali is described as a Matrika, who sucked all the blood of demon Raktabija. Kali is given the epithet Chamunda in the text. When demon Shumbha challenges Durga to a single combat, she absorbs the Matrikas in herself and says that they are her different forms.Kinsley p. 158, Devi Mahatmya verses 10.2–5 In the Vamana Purana too, the Matrikas arise from different parts of Devi and not from male gods although they are described and named after the male deities.Kinsley p. 158, verses 30.3–9 In Matsya Purana, Shiva had created seven Matrikas to combat the demon Andhaka, who had the ability to duplicate from each drop of his blood that falls from him when he is wounded. The Matrikas drink up his blood and help Shiva defeat the demon. After the battle, the Matrikas begin a rampage of destruction by starting to devour other gods, demons and peoples of the world. Narasimha, Vishnu's man-lion incarnation, creates a host of thirty-two benign goddesses who calm down the terrible, fire-breathing Matrikas. Narasimha commanded the Matrikas to protect the world, instead of destroying it and thus be worshipped by mankind. At the end of the episode, Shiva's terrible form Bhairava is enshrined with the images of the Matrikas at the place where the battle took place.Kinsley p. 158-159, verses 179.8–90Pal in Singh p.1835-6 This story is retold in Vishnudharmottara Purana.Kinsley p. 159, verses 1.225 Vishnudharmottara Purana further relates them with vices or inauspicious emotions like envy, pride, anger etc.Kinsley p. 159, verses 17.33–37 In Varaha Purana, they are created from the distracted mind of goddess Vaishnavi, who loses her concentration while doing asceticism. They are described as lovely and act as the goddesses' attendants on the battlefield.Kinsley p. 159, Verses 44.1–96 In Bhagavata Purana, when beings created by Vishnu are enlisted; the Matrikas are listed with rakshasas (demons), bhutas (ghosts), pretas, dakinis and other dangerous beings. In the same text, milkmaids offer a prayer for protection of the infant-god Krishna from the Matrikas.Kinsley p. 159, verses 2.10.37–39 and 10.63.6 ff., 10.6,27–29 The Devi Purana (6th – 10th century) mentions a group of sixteen matrikas and six other types of Matrikas mentioned, apart from the Saptamatrikas.Pal in Singh p.1839 It introduces the Loka-matara (mothers of the world), a term used in the Mahabharata, in the very first chapter. Kind to all creatures, the Matrikas are said to reside in various places for the benefit of children.Pal in Singh p.1835 The text paradoxically describes the Matrikas as being created by various gods like Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, Indra as well as being their mothers.Pal in Singh p.1844 Devi Purana describe a pentad of Matrikas, who help Ganesha to kill demons.Pal in Singh p.1840, Chapters 111–116 Further, sage Mandavya is described as worshipping the ' (the five mothers) named Ambika (Kaumari), Rudrani, Chamunda, Brahmi and Vaishnavi and who have been established by Brahma; for saving king Harishchandra from calamities. The Matrikas direct the sage to perform worship of '(interpreted as a Yantra or Mandala or a circular shrine to the Matrikas), established by Vishnu on the Vindhya mountains, by meat and ritual sacrifice.Pal in Singh p.1840, Chapter 116(82–86) =Mahabharata= A Hoysala sculpture of Chamunda, Halebidu. Surrounded by skeletons, the goddess has large nails and protruding teeth and wears a garland of skulls. The Mahabharata narrates in different chapters the birth of warrior-god Skanda (the son of Shiva and Parvati) and his association with the Matrikas – his adopted mothers. In one version, Indra (king of gods) sends the goddesses called \\"mothers of the world\\" to kill him. However, upon seeing Skanda, instead they follow their maternal instincts and raise him. In the chapter Vana-parva version, the Saptamatrikas are mentioned.Mahabharata verses 215.16 – 215.18, two of the goddesses are described in 215.21–22 Later in the Mahabharata; when absorption of these indigenous goddesses in the Brahmanic pantheon was initiated, a standardized group of seven goddesses – the Saptamatrikas, Shaktis or powers of Brahmanic gods are mentioned as Brahmi, Maheshvari, Kumari, Vaishnavi, Varahi, Indrani and Chamunda. In other accounts of Skanda's birth in Mahabharata, eight ferocious goddesses emerge from Skanda, when struck by Indra's Vajra (thunderbolt). These are Kāki, Halimā, Mālinī, , Āryā, Palālā and Vaimitrā, which Skanda accepted as his mothers, who stole other children – a characteristic of the Matrikas.Kinsley p.152 Another account mentions the Maha-matrikas (the great mothers), a group of the wives of six of the Saptarishis (7 great sages), who were accused of being Skanda's real mothers and thus abandoned by their husbands. They request Skanda to adopt them as his mothers. Skanda agrees and grants them two boons: to be worshipped as great goddesses and permission to torment children as long as they are younger than 16 years and then act as their protectors. These six goddesses as well as the Saptamatrikas are identified or associated with Vedic Krittikas, the constellation Pleiades.Harper in Harper and Brown, p.116 The Shalya Parva of the Mahabharata mentions characteristics of a host of Matrikas, who serve Skanda. Ninety-two of them are named but the text says there exist more. The Shalya Parva describes them as young, cheerful, most of them fair but having dangerous features like long nails and large teeth. They are said to fight like Indra in battles, invoking terror in minds of enemies; speak different foreign tongues and lives in inaccessible places away from human settlements like crossroads, caves, mountains, springs, forests, riverbanks and cremation grounds.Kinsley p.153Pattanaik pp.132–3Vaishampayana said... The Mahabharata translated by Kisari Mohan Ganguli (1883 -1896), Book 9: Shalya Parva: Section 46. Notable among these lists of Matrikas is Putana, a goddess who tried to kill the infant Krishna (an incarnation of Vishnu) by suckling him with poisoned breast milk and consequently killed by Krishna.Kinsley p.154 Depictions Bronze group with (from left) Ganesha; Brahmi, Kumari, Vaishnavi – the 3 Matrikas, and Kubera taken at the British Museum; Originally from Eastern India, Dedicated in 43rd year of reign of Pala king Mahipala I (about AD 1043) The textual description of Matrikas is generally frightening and ferocious. In the Mahabharata, all the seven mothers are described as fatal or serve as threats to foetuses or infants. They are described as living in trees, crossroads, caves and funeral grounds and they are terrible as well as beautiful. But, in the sculptural portrayal, they are depicted quite differently as protectors and benevolent mothers. They are armed with the same weapons, wear the same ornaments, and ride the same vahanas and carry the same banners as their corresponding male deities. The Saptamatrkas are generally carved in relief on a rectangular stone slab in the sequential order of Brahmani, Maheshvari, Kumari, Vaishnavi, Varahi, Indrani and Chamunda, being flanked by two male figures – a terrible form of Shiva (Virabhadra) and his son Ganesha in both sides (first – on their right and last – on their left). Thus, the Matrikas are considered Saivite goddesses. They are often depicted on the lintel slabs of the main door of a Shiva temple – mainly in Jaunsar- Bawar region, with their respective mounts forming the pedestal. Sometimes, they are occupied by the couple Uma-Maheshvara (Parvati and Shiva). The earliest instance of their portrayal with Uma-Maheshvara is at Desha Bhattarika, Nepal although now the Matrika images have withered away.Singh p.1855 The 12th century Sanskrit author Kalhana mentions worship of Matrikas with Shiva in Kashmir, his work Rajatarangini.Pal in Singh p.1858 Nataraja–Shiva (left) with Virabhadra and the first three Matrikas. Matrikas are depicted with children – Ellora Three panels of Saptamatrikas appear near the Shiva cave at Udayagiri, Bhopal.Harper in Harper and Brown, p.117 They are also depicted in the Shaiva caves of Elephanta and Ellora (Caves 21, 14, 16 and 22).Berkson p.87 In sixth century Rameshvara cave (Cave 21) at Ellora, \\"With the terrific aspect repressed entirely, the matrikas are depicted as benign and are worshipped in adulation. Sensuous, elegant, tender, beautiful adolescents, they are yet haughty and grand, quintessentially the creatrix.\\"Berkson p.134 Karrtikkeyi (Kumari) is depicted with a child on her lap and even Varahi is depicted with a human head, rather than the usual boar one.For images see Berkson pp.136 – 144 In Ravana-ka-kai cave (Cave 14), each of the matrikas is with a child.Berkson p.186 In eighth century Kailash Temple (cave 16) – dedicated to Shiva – of Rashtrakuta period, the Matrikas appear on the southern boundary of the temple. As the influence of Tantra rose, the fertility area and upper parts of body in the Matrika sculptures were stressed.Berkson pp.186–7 In each of the four depictions at Ellora, the matrikas are accompanied by Virabhadra, Ganesha and also on their left (besides Ganesha) by Kala (Time personified or Death).Berkson p.135 The presence of Kala in form of a skeleton, seems to indicate the darker aspect of the matrikas' nature. At Osian, the Matrikas is flanked by Ganesha and Kubera (the treasurer of the gods and a devotee of Shiva) while Virabhadra sits in the middle of the group.Kalia p.109 In Gupta and post-Gupta art, like in 6th Century caves of Shamalaji, the Matrikas are accompanied by Shiva's son Skanda. Associations =Yoginis= Kaumari, folio from Devi Mahatmya. Often the Matrikas are confused with the Yoginis, a group of sixty-four or eighty-one Tantric goddesses.Dehejia, Vidya, Yogini Cult and Temples In Sanskrit literature the Yoginis have been represented as the attendants or various manifestations of goddess Durga engaged in fighting with the demons Shumbha and Nishumbha, and the principal Yoginis are identified with the Matrikas.Bhattacharyya, N. N., History of the Sakta Religion, Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers Pvt. Ltd. (New Delhi, 1974, 2d ed. 1996), p. 128. Other Yoginis are described as born from one or more Matrikas. The derivation of sixty-four Yoginis from eight Matrikas became a common tradition, by mid- 11th century. The Mandala (circle) and chakra of Yoginis were used alternatively. The eighty-one Yoginis evolve from a group of nine Matrikas, instead of seven or eight. The Saptamatrika (Brahmi, Maheshvari, Kumari, Vaishnavi, Varahi, Indrani and Chamunda) joined by Chandika and Mahalakshmi form the nine Matrika cluster. Each Matrika is considered to be a Yogini and is associated with eight other Yoginis resulting in the troupe of eighty-one (nine times nine).Wangu p.114 Thus, Yoginis are considered as manifestations or daughters of the Matrikas.Banerji p.296 The yoginis also occupy an important place in Tantra, one of their chief temples in India are in 'Ranipur-Jharial' and the 'Chaushathi Jogini' (the 64 yoginis) temple near Bhubaneswar, Odisha. The rise of Yogini cult is also analogous to the rise of the Matrikas' cult. Bhattacharyya sums it this way: \\"The growing importance of Shaktism [of the matrikas and yoginis in the first millennium CE] brought them into greater prominence and distributed their cult far and wide. [...] The primitive Yogini cult was also revived on account of the increasing influenced of the cult of the Seven Mothers.\\" =Script characters= Matrika (Sanskrit mātṛkā) is also a term used to denote features of Indic scripts (also in combination with aksara, matrikaksara), though there is considerable variation in the precise interpretation of the term from one author to another. Sometimes it denotes a single character, the entire collection of characters (an \\"alphabet\\"), the alphabetic \\"matrix\\" used as a collation tool, vowels in particular (considered erroneous by Georg Bühler), or the sound of the syllable represented by the character. Various traditions identify the script matrikas with the personified divine Matrikas. According to K.C. Aryan, the number of Matrikas is determined in the structure of the Devanagari alphabet. First is the (A) group which contains the vowels, then the (Ka), (Cha), (Ta), (ta), (Pa), (Ya) and (Ksha) groups. The seven mother goddesses (Saptamatrikas) correspond to the seven consonant groups; when the vocalic (A) group is added to it, the eight mother goddesses (Ashtamatrikas) are obtained.Aryan (1980), p. 9 The Shaktas hold that the Mothers preside over impurities (mala) and over sounds of the language. The Mothers were identified with fourteen vowels plus the anusarva and visarga – making their number sixteen.Jain p.163 In Tantra, the fifty or fifty-one letters including vowels as well as consonants from A to Ksha, of the Devanagari alphabet itself, the Varnamala of bija, have been described as being the Matrikas themselves. It is believed that they are infused with the power of the Divine Mother herself. The Matrikas are considered to be the subtle form of the letters (varna). These letters combined make up syllables (pada) which are combined to make sentences (vakya) and it is of these elements that mantra is composed. It is believed that the power of mantra derives from the fact that the letters of the alphabet are in fact forms of the goddess.Aryan (1980), pp. 24–28 The 50 Matrika Kalas are given in the same account as follows: Nivritti, Pratishtha, Vidya, Shanti, Indhika, Dipika, Mochika, Para, Sukshma, Sukshmamrita, Jnanamrita, Apypayani, Vyapini, Vyomarupa, Ananta, Srishti, Riddhi, Smriti, Medha, Kanti, Lakshmi, Dyuti, Sthira, Sthiti, Siddhi, Jada, Palini, Shanti, Aishvarya, Rati, Kamika, Varada, Ahladini, Pritih, Dirgha, Tikshna, Raudri, Bhaya, Nidra, Tandra, Kshudha, Krodhini, Kriya, Utkari, Mrityurupa, Pita, Shveta, Asita, Ananta.Woodroffe, p. 103 Sometimes, the Matrikas represent a diagram written in the letter, believed to possess magical powers.Banerji p.61 Worship =In India= Shrine of the \\"Seven Mothers\\" in Ramanathapuram District, Tamil Nadu. According to Leslie C. Orr, the Saptamatrika, who first appeared in South India in the eighth century, had once temples dedicated exclusively to them, but the ninth century onwards, they were demoted to status of \\"deities of the entourage\\" (parivara devata) of Shiva. Their images moved from the sanctums to corners of temple complexes and now they are as guardian deities in small village shrines.Leslie C. Orr, Gods and Worshippers on South Indian sacred ground in The World in the Year 1000 By James Heitzman and Wolfgang Schenkluhn, pp.244–5, Published 2004, University Press of America, 338 pages, . The Saptamatrikas are worshipped as Saptakanyakas (the celestial nymphs) in most South Indian Shiva temples especially in Tamil Nadu. But the Selliyamman temple at Alambakkam in Tiruchirapalli district (In 1909 called Trichonopoly district) is important in worship of the Matrikas. Here once stood a temple dedicated to the Saptamatrika, which was replaced by the present temple.The Madras Epigraphical Department, Annual Report 1909-10 p. 285 as quoted in pp.285–6 South Indian shrines illustrated By P. V. Jagadisa Ayyar. Published 1993, Asian Educational Services, In Tamil Nadu, the matrikas are called as Kannimargal or Saptakannigal and are worshipped in every nook and corner. This worship in Tamil Nadu is very ancient and still in practice for thousands of years. In India, shrines of the Saptamatrikas are located in \\"the wilderness\\", usually near lakes or rivers, and are made of seven vermilion smeared stones. It is believed that the Matrikas kill fetuses and newborns unless pacified with bridal finery and prayers by women.Pattanaik p.131 Devdutt Pattanaik says: \\"The cult of the Seven Mothers is found all over India. ... Pregnant women and nursing mothers worship them. When these goddesses are angry, they make women barren and strike newborns with fatal fevers. When they are appeased, they ensure the health and happiness of children.\\" A prominent Saptamatrika temple is located near Baitarani River, in Jajpur. The Saptamatrika images are worshipped by women on Pithori – new moon day, with the 64 yoginis represented by rice flour images or supari nuts. The goddesses are worshipped by ceremonial offerings of fruit and flower and mantras.The Hindu Religious Year By Muriel Marion Underhill; Published 1991; Asian Educational Services, 194 pages, , p.110 =In Nepal= The Matrikas function both as city protectors and individual protectors in both Hinduism and Buddhism. The Astha matrika are considered as Ajimas (grandmother goddesses, who are feared as bringer of disease and misfortune as well act as protectresses) in the Newar pantheon. Temples (pithas i.e. seats) of the ashta matrika built in and around Kathmandu are considered powerful places of worship.The Rough Guide to Nepal By David Reed, James McConnachie p.521 Published 2002 Rough Guides The pithas are usually open-air shrines, but may be closed structures too. In these pithas, the Matrikas are worshipped with their followers (ganas) in form of stone statues or natural stones, while in dyochems (god-houses) in towns and villages, they are represented in brass images. The brass images (utsav-murtis) are paraded around town and placed at their respective pithas once every year. Like Vishnudharmottara Purana (discussed in Legends), the Matrikas are considered as representing a vice and are worshipped by pithapuja (a pilgrimage around the pithas) to free oneself from them.van den Hoek, Bert in Nas, p.362 Though each pitha is primarily dedicated to a Matrika, the other Matrikas are also worshipped as subordinate deities.van den Hoek, Bert in Nas, p.367-8 The pithas, which are \\"theoretically located at the outer boundaries of the city\\" are said to form a protective mandala around the city and assisted to a certain compass point.van den Hoek, Bert in Nas, p.364 In other temples like the ones dedicated to Pacali Bhairava, the Asthamatrikas are worshipped as a circle of stones. In Bhaktapur, the Ashtamatrikas are believed to the preserver goddesses of the city guarding the eight geometrical directions. Mary Sluser says \\"Not only do the guard the compass points but they are also regarded as regents of the sky.\\"White p.61 Sometimes, they are paired with the Ashta Bhairava (Eight aspects of Bhairava) and sculpted on temple roofs or terraces. Nepali Buddhists worship the Matrikas as described in Dharanisamgrahas.Pal in Singh p.1851 The Malla king of Nepal Srinivasa Malla built the Patan durbar (court) in 1667 AD and is believed to have seen the Matrikas dance in the durbar one night. The king ordered that the Ashta-matrika be worshipped during the Ashwin Navaratri and cost is defrayed by the durbar. The custom continues til this day.p.245 History of Nepal: With an Introductory Sketch of the Country and People of Nepal. By Daniel Wright Published 1996, Asian Educational Services,340 pages, Another festival Ghorajatra is celebrated in Patan with animal sacrifices to the Matrikas.Nepal Handbook By Tom Woodhatch Published 1999 Footprint Travel Guides 572 pages In the Kathmandu valley of Nepal, the Ashta-matrikas with a central village goddess are worshipped as protectors of the city or town. They are identified with the guardians of directions (digpala), places (lokapala) or lands (kshatrapala), satiated by blood sacrifice. Newar Buddhists associate the Matrikas with 24 human qualities, which can mastered by visiting three sets of eight Matrika pithas.Hiltebeitel p. 260 =Tantric worship= Veerabhadran, Brahmani, Vaishnavi, Maheswari, Kaumari, Varahi, Indrani, Chamundi and Ganesha at Panchalingeshvara temple in Karnataka. The 7th century Sanskrit author Banabhatta mentions the propitiation of Matrikas by a Tantric ascetic in his Harshacharita.Banerji p.34 The text mentions use of ' (mandala of the Matrikas) or Yantra along with a special anusthana (ritual) to cure the ailing king.Joshi, M.C. in Harper and Brown, p.48 The text describes \\"young nobles [..](of the king) burning themselves with lamps to propitiate the Matrikas in a temple dedicated to the Matrikas ('). Banabhatta's Kadambari, Bhasa's Cārudatta, Shudraka's Mrichakatika mention the ritual offerings of food and shrines of Matrikas at crossroads. Other offerings include flowers and clothes and meat and wine for some Matrikas. Tantric works like Tantrarāja-Tantra (unknown date, author) and discuss the worship of Matrikas as Shaktis or letters of the alphabet.Banerji p.148 and 205 A process of this worship, Matrika-nyasa (lit. \\"installation of the Mothers\\"), is described in Devi Gita, part of Devi Bhagavata Purana.Brown, p.292 Verses 10.6–8 It involves installation of powers of Matrikas – as letters of the alphabet – in one's body, by \\"feeling the deity worshipped in different parts of the body\\" like head, face, anus and legs and reciting mantras.Banerji p.27 The Hrillekha-matrika-nyasa, a more specialized form of Matrika-nyasa, combines the installation of \\"most powerful set of all letters (Matrikas)\\" with the seed syllable ' of Goddess Bhuvaneshvari.Brown, p.293-4 Stone inscriptions of Tantric worship of The Matrikas are found in Gangadhar, Rajasthan(by king Vishvavarman- 423 C.E., identified as the first epigraphic evidence of Tantra worship); in Bihar (by Guptas – fifth century) and in Deogarh, Uttar Pradesh (by – sixth century). The Gangadhar inscripture deals with a construction to a shrine to Chamunda and the other Matrikas, \\"who are attended by Dakinis (female demons)\\" and rituals of daily Tantric worship (Tantrobhuta) like the ritual of Bali (offering of grain). The eight Matrikas are said to reside the second line of bhupura in Sri Chakra. They are frequently aligned with the Eight Bhairavas, as in '. The (1.33) explains that the primary function of Matrikas is to preside eight groups (vargas) of letters of Devanagari alphabet, while Brahmayāmala states they issue originate from the vowels.Brooks p.143-4 =Rituals and goals of worship= The Natya Shastra (13.66) recommends worship to Matrikas before setting up the stage and before dance performances. Indra declares in chapter 90 of Devi Purana that the Matrikas are the best among all deities and should be worshipped in cities, villages, towns and shields.Singh p.1850 Matrikas are generally to be worshipped on all occasions with Navagraha (the nine planets) and the Dikpala (Guardians of the directions) and at night with the Goddess.Singh p.1850-51 The Matsya Purana and Devi Purana prescribe that Matrika shrines should be north-facing and be placed in northern part of a temple-complex.Pal in Singh p.1850-1 The temples of the Matrikas are found earliest dating to the fourth century and from textual evidence, it is predicated that \\"there must be impressive shrines all over the [Indian] subcontinent\\".Pal in Singh p.1854 Although circular Mandalas and Chakras are mentioned in religious texts, most existing shrines are rectangular in nature. Pal speculates that earlier circular shrines, which open to the sky or under trees of less durable material were replaced by the Guptas in stone as rectangular shrines. The Devi Purana mentions the Matrikas or Deva Shaktis (powers of the gods) as group of seven or more, who should be worshipped for Mukti (liberation) by all, but particularly kings for powers of domination. The Saptamatrika are worshipped for \\"personal and spiritual renewal\\" with Mukti as the ultimate goal as well as for powers to control and rule and earthly desires (Bhukti).Harper in Harper and Brown, p.122 Also important are the banners of the Saptamatrikas, which are carved outside the Udayagiri caves. These banners are called \\"Indra's sisters\\" in the Devi Purana. The Purana lists them as: swan, bull, peacock, conch, discus, elephant and skeleton – attributes of the Matrikas. A king installing these banners is believed to get mukti and bhukti. As per the Nitisara, Matrikas acted as the king's tangible Shaktis and conferred the power to conquer and rule.Harper in Harper and Brown, p.125-7  See also  * Devi Kanya Kumari * Kaumari * Kumari (goddess) * Kanwari Notes b.

It was first released in Japan on October 15, 1988 for the Sharp X68000 computer. A year later, it was ported to the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis game console and released in Japan (under the name Thunder Force II MD), Europe, and the United States. Thunder Force II was one of the six launch titles for the U.S. Genesis release. The Genesis port was later included in Thunder Force Gold Pack Volume 1 for the Sega Saturn. It is the second chapter of the Thunder Force series. Gameplay Stages in the game are now split into two formats: the free-directional scrolling, overhead stage format from the previous game (referred to as \\"top-view stages\\"), and horizontal forward- scrolling stages (referred to as \\"side-view\\" stages) which would become the series mainstay, dropping the former entirely. Each stage begins in the top- view perspective, where the player has to locate the cores of a certain number of major enemy bases and destroy them. After this is accomplished, the stage continues from the side-view perspective, which plays like a traditional horizontal scrolling shooter. After the boss of the side-view sub stage is defeated, the player moves on to the next stage. Building upon its predecessor, Thunder Force II introduced a weapon system that would become the staple for the rest of the series. The player's ship now has default arsenal of weapons which include a twin, forward firing shot (the \\"Twin\\" shot), a single forward, and single backward firing shot (the \\"Back\\" shot), and a bomb shot in the top-view stages. By collecting certain items, the default weapons can be upgraded to more a powerful level. Also, the player could obtain a certain number of new weapons with various unique abilities by collecting the weapon's corresponding item (the \\"Hunter\\", a signature weapon of the series, debuts in this game). Once obtained, the weapons can be switched between at the player's desire, but if the ship is destroyed, all weapons are lost except for the defaults. The top-view and the side-view stages have different sets of weapons; losing weapons in the top-view stages do not affect the weapons equipped in the side-view stages and vice versa. Thunder Force II also introduced the CRAW add-ons; small pods which revolve around the ship. The function of the CRAWs is to block weak incoming bullets, and to provide extra firepower by firing single, normal shots. The player may acquire up to two CRAWs at a time, but will lose them upon ship destruction. Exclusive to this game is an item which temporally increases their orbit speed, making them more likely to block bullets. Plot Taking place soon after Thunder Force, the ORN Empire creates a powerful new battleship, the Plealos (a.k.a. Preareos). Using this battleship, ORN once again attacks the Galaxy Federation. The outcome of the attacks result in the destruction of the Galaxy Federation affiliated planet of Reda, and heavy destruction on the planet Nepura (a.k.a. Nebula), which ORN eventually captures from the Galaxy Federation. Eventually, the Galaxy Federation learns that ORN houses Plealos deep below Nebula's surface when not in use and takes the opportunity to plan an operation to take it down. They send the next iteration of their Fire Leo series of fighter craft, the FIRE LEO-02 Exceliza, to destroy ORN bases on Nepura and eventually find and destroy Plealos. The player controls the Exceliza and travels through a variety of stages to accomplish this goal. The cover image for the Thunder Force II Sega/MD/G package by Illustrator Marc Ericksen describes the attack of the advanced FIRE LEO-02s on Nepura utilizing its forward and rear firing ordinance (above right). Reception Japanese magazine Famitsu gave the Mega Drive version of the game a score of 28 out of 40. UK magazine Mean Machines gave also reviewed the Mega Drive version, and gave it a score of 82%.

It is the third chapter in the Thunder Force series. It was then retooled into an arcade game named Thunder Force AC. In 1991, Thunder Force AC was ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System under the title Thunder Spirits. Gameplay For Thunder Force III, the free- directional, overhead stage format featured in the previous two games is removed and replaced entirely by the horizontally scrolling stage format. The horizontal format became the new standard for the series. The player is allowed to choose which of the initial five planets (Hydra, Gorgon, Seiren, Haides, and Ellis), to start on. After the first five stages are completed, the game continues for three more stages into ORN headquarters. The weapon system from Thunder Force II returns in this game, with some modifications. Some weapons from Thunder Force II are reused or modified slightly (the enhanceable Twin shot and Back shot remain the defaults), while others are completely new and exclusive to the game. This time, when the player's ship is destroyed, only the weapon that was currently in use is lost (unless it is a default weapon and assuming the game is operating at the default difficulty settings). On any higher difficulty modes than the default one, all weapons are lost when the ship gets destroyed. CLAWs also make their return and have the same behavior and functions, except now when the player collects the CLAW item, the ship automatically receives its maximum two CLAWs (again, CLAWs are lost upon ship destruction in every difficulty modes). Also, when using most weapons, the CLAWs will mimic the ship and fire the same weapon (similar to the Options in Gradius games). The final new addition is that the player's ship now has a speed setting, which can be increased or decreased across four levels at the press of a button. Plot Thunder Force III takes place about 100 years after Thunder Force and directly after Thunder Force II. Despite their successes, the Galaxy Federation has not been faring well in their battle against the ORN Empire. ORN has installed cloaking devices on five major planets in their space territory that conceal their main base, making it difficult for the Galaxy Federation to locate and attack their headquarters. Also, ORN has built a remote defense system to protect itself named Cerberus, which is especially efficient at neutralizing large ships and fleets. Knowing this, the Galaxy Federation creates the FIRE LEO-03 Styx; a craft small enough to avoid detection by Cerberus, yet equipped with the firepower of a large starfighter. The Galaxy Federation deploys Styx (which is controlled by the player) on a mission to destroy the five cloaking devices, infiltrate the Empire's headquarters, and destroy ORN emperor, the bio-computer \\"Cha Os\\". Ports Thunder Force III was released on June 9, 1990, in Japan. Due to the success of the game for the Mega Drive/Genesis, it was decided that the game would be brought to the arcade scene under the name Thunder Force AC. Ported to Sega's System C-2 hardware, Thunder Force AC is almost graphically identical to its Mega Drive counterpart, with only very minor and often unnoticeable differences. Thunder Force AC has been described as a retooling of Thunder Force III because it borrows enemies and stages from the earlier Thunder Force II as well as adding some original content. Thunder Force AC was also ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1991 as Thunder Spirits, by Toshiba. The SNES version does away with level selection, changes several levels, and features a modified soundtrack. In 1996, Thunder Force III was re-released in Thunder Force Gold Pack 1 for the Sega Saturn. Thunder Force AC was re-released in Thunder Force Gold Pack 2, also for the Sega Saturn. With Sega buying the rights to the series in 2016, it was confirmed in 2020 that Thunder Force AC would be re-released on Nintendo Switch worldwide in May 2020 as part of the Sega Ages line. This version includes an easy mode, online leaderboards, improved sound, and various other improvements. Reception The original Genesis version received much praise. GamePro called it \\"a straightforward flying shooter with gorgeous graphics\\", particularly mentioning the large, detailed enemies and \\"intricate backgrounds\\". They described it as extremely difficult, most suited for hardcore shooter fans. MegaTech magazine praised the use of parallax, as well as the sound and gameplay. In 1992 Mega placed the game at #17 in their Top Mega Drive Games of All Time.Mega magazine issue 1, page 76, Future Publishing, Oct 1992. In 1997 Electronic Gaming Monthly listed it as the 59th best console video game of all time, calling it the best shooter on the Genesis. Note: Contrary to the title, the intro to the article explicitly states that the list covers console video games only, meaning PC games and arcade games were not eligible. Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu gave it a score of 31 out of 40. In Japan, Game Machine listed Thunder Force AC on their February 1, 1991 issue as being the sixteenth most-successful table arcade unit of the year. Famitsu gave Thunder Spirits version a lower score, giving it only 23/40.

It is the fourth installment in Technosoft's Thunder Force series, and the third and final one created for the Genesis. It was developed by the team at Technosoft that ported Devil's Crush to the Genesis rather than the team that developed the previous Thunder Force games. Like its predecessors, it is a horizontally scrolling shooter, but it also features extensive vertical scrolling with large playing fields. The game was considered by journalists as one of the best shooters on the Genesis when it was launched. Critics especially praised the game's graphics, including the vertical and parallax scrolling for illustrating the immense environments. Some believed that underneath the graphical sheen, the gameplay was relatively average however. Thunder Force IV was rereleased on the Sega Saturn in 1996 and the Nintendo Switch in 2018.  Gameplay  Battling with a boss Thunder Force IV is a horizontal shoot 'em up. The story takes place two years after the events of Thunder Force III. The player takes on the role of a fighter pilot to battle the Ohn Empire, which is plotting the extinction of the human race. The first four stages can be selected in any order. There are ten stages total. They scroll horizontally automatically, and the player can also explore up and down to scroll the screen vertically and reveal a larger playing field. The player can change the speed of their ship at any time for easier maneuverability. Scrolling up and down will reveal different waves of enemies the player can shoot down, as well as hidden power-ups. At the end of each stage is a boss, and sometimes there are bosses mid-stage. Some enemies will drop power-ups that if picked up by the player will arm the ship with new weaponry, including a variety of missiles and lasers that fire in different patterns. Each weapon has advantages and drawbacks, and are more effective depending on the battle situation the player finds themselves in. The player can hold multiple weapons and cycle through them at will. Other power-ups include shields and satellite ships that revolve their ship and multiplies their firepower. Half-way through the game, the player gains a powerful \\"Thunder Sword\\" attack which deal massive damage to enemies. It requires that the player has two satellite ships.  Development  Thunder Force IV was developed in Japan by Technosoft as the third Thunder Force game for the Sega Genesis (known as the Mega Drive outside North America). Only the sound department was brought over from the original staff of Thunder Force II (1988) and Thunder Force III (1990); the rest of the team had previously ported the pinball game Devil's Crush to the Genesis. They chose to develop Thunder Force IV when given the opportunity to develop an original game. Having taken the reins for the Thunder Force series, the team felt a responsibility to surpass the quality of earlier series titles. They borrowed code from the previous games, and built upon it using what they learned when porting Devil's Crush. (Translation ) The composer for Thunder Force IV previously worked on Thunder Force III and also composed some original music for Devil's Crush. The sound team staff, lead by Naosuke Arai, were fans of heavy metal, so they worked on finding a method to create an electric guitar sound using the Genesis's FM synthesizer. They ran into difficulties and eventually settled on using the system's distortion sound effects to positive results.  Release  Technosoft held a promotional event for the game at a convention in Tokyo on June 7, 1992. The event included a tournament, giving fans an early opportunity to play the game. The game was released in Japan on July 24, 1992, and in Europe and North America in January 1993. Sega of America renamed the North American version to . The game was ported to the Sega Saturn as a part of Thunder Force: Gold Pack 2, a compilation disc released on November 29, 1996 in Japan. The compilation also includes Thunder Force AC (an arcade port of Thunder Force III). This version improved on the original by eliminating sluggish frame rate issues, adding an easier mode which gives the player bonus defensive abilities, as well as adding the fighter from Thunder Force III as a secret playable ship. In 2016, Sega acquired the rights to the Thunder Force series, and announced they were looking to revive Thunder Force IV. Two years later, in 2018, they announced a rerelease of Thunder Force IV along with other Sega games for the Nintendo Switch under the Sega Ages brand. The game was released on September 20, 2018 along with Sonic the Hedgehog (1991). Players can choose between the Japanese and international versions and take advantage of the improvements and other features from the Saturn port. Reception Thunder Force IV was quickly identified as one of the best Genesis shooters when it was released. Critics agreed that the graphics were one of the game's best qualities. Mean Machines called them \\"state of the art\\" and highlighted the vertical scrolling for \\"evoking a sense of vastness.\\" The vertical scrolling also impressed other journalists. Mega wrote that the landscapes were expansive, and appreciated the parallax scrolling effects. The parallax scrolling was also picked up by Mega Drive Advanced Gaming, which called it \\"the most stunning use of parallax ever seen on the 16-bit Sega.\\" They believed the game pushed the technical capabilities of the Mega Drive. Other visual aspects highlighted by critics included the large sprites and smooth animation. Most critics liked the music and sound effects as well. Mega disliked the music, calling it \\"aimless, twittery, Japanese meanderings.\\" GameFan called the graphics and sound great quality considering the game was on a cartridge and not a CD. The graphical quality came at a cost however, as some reviewers experienced slow frame rate issues when the screen was busy with action. The high quality presentation of Thunder Force IV was not enough to cover up some concerns with its gameplay. While most critics enjoyed the game, even calling it \\"addictive\\" and \\"pure adrenaline\\", some thought the game lacked originality and felt like an average shooter. Mean Machines wrote that it was similar to Thunder Force III and called it \\"\\"the best shoot 'em up you'll get on the Mega Drive, but suffers from complete lack of originality. This is the genre taken to its extreme.\\" Sega Force agreed that it was similar to the earlier Thunder Force games. Mega added on to this, saying \\"beneath the graphical gymnastics of the surface, the game really is...decidedly average.\\" Critics that were more receptive to the gameplay commended the level of difficulty, the ability to pick the stage order, and the variety of weapons and power-ups. = Retrospective coverage = Thunder Force IV continues to be regarded as one of the best shoot 'em ups of its era. IGN rated it as the fourth best classic shoot 'em up, calling it Technosoft's best shooter and \\"the pinnacle of Genesis shooters.\\" Retro Gamer placed it among their top ten Mega Drive games, praising its sense of scale, exotic environments, frenetic action, and graphical fidelity. In another review, Retro Gamer called Thunder Force IV \\"Technosoft's masterpiece\\" and an essential game for shooter fans. Both USGamer and Hardcore Gaming 101 discussed the game's presentation in high regard. Paul Brownlee, writing for Hardcore Gaming 101, called it one of the best looking Genesis games and said of the soundtrack: \\"it's one of the best on the system from both an artistic and technical standpoint, standing among greats such as Streets of Rage 2 and MUSHA.\\" Notes References External links * Category:1992 video games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:Sega Genesis games Category:Sega Saturn games IV Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in Japan ja:サンダーフォース#サンダーフォースIV ","title":"Thunder Force IV"},{"id":"3934487","text":"\\"Donut Run\\" is the eleventh episode of the second season of the American mystery television series Veronica Mars, and the thirty-third episode overall. Written and directed by series creator Rob Thomas, \\"Donut Run\\" premiered on January 25, 2006 on UPN. The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life as a high school student while moonlighting as a private detective. In this episode, after Meg's death in \\"One Angry Veronica\\", Duncan (Teddy Dunn) steals his baby daughter and runs away with her. Meanwhile, Logan (Jason Dohring) and Weevil (Francis Capra) work together on solving Felix Toombs's murder. \\"Donut Run\\" was the first episode of the series to be directed by Rob Thomas. The episode also features the final regular appearance by series regular Duncan Kane (Teddy Dunn). Fans often expressed their dislike for the character and his relationship with Veronica, preferring the Veronica-Logan relationship. \\"Donut Run\\" was the lowest-rated episode of the series. Nevertheless, it was critically acclaimed.  Synopsis  Veronica and Logan ride the elevator and reach the apartment before finding Kendall (Charisma Carpenter), indicating that Duncan was sleeping with her. Veronica confronts Duncan, who abruptly breaks up with her in the middle of the fight. After their breakup, Veronica slips into a depression; Keith (Enrico Colantoni) attempts to console her to no avail. Logan and Weevil discuss who killed Felix, and they deduce that whoever it was in cahoots with the Fitzpatricks. Sheriff Lamb (Michael Muhney) comes in and informs Veronica that Duncan has disappeared and kidnapped his daughter, Faith. He arrests Veronica as a supposed accomplice. At the police station, Keith pressures Veronica to tell the truth about her unknowing involvement in supplying the finances for the kidnapping. Afterwards, Sheriff Lamb requires her to write down everything she knows on a notepad. Logan asks Dick (Ryan Hansen) to get some drugs for the Pacific Coast Highway biker gang. Vinnie Van Lowe (Ken Marino) talks to Veronica and says that he’ll find Duncan before she does. Veronica learns that Wallace didn’t come back to Neptune to play basketball, as he originally said. Dick delivers the drugs, and Logan learns that Hector is now the prime suspect in Felix's death. Two FBI agents talk to Sheriff Lamb, intent on getting the baby back. Veronica shows some information about Duncan’s computer. Weevil talks to Hector, who denies the accusation. The FBI agents and Sheriff Lamb learn that Duncan bought a boat. However, when the boat is searched they do not find anyone—just evidence that people were there. Veronica thinks that Duncan has been picked up by someone. Veronica asks Vinnie Van Lowe to give a letter to Duncan. Weevil talks to Sean Friedrich (Kevin Sheridan), a drug dealer, but learns that he wasn’t working for the Fitzpatricks. Veronica talks to Wallace (Percy Daggs III), who says that a teammate crashed his car into a man and drove away while he was in it. He felt incredibly guilty and decided to come back. Veronica receives a short call from Duncan just as the FBI agents track Duncan’s location. Veronica goes into an abandoned apartment, where she meets Duncan. It turns out that the set of events that seemed to point towards Duncan having stolen the baby were a scam so that Veronica and Duncan could successfully smuggle Duncan and the baby to Mexico together. Sheriff Lamb learns this fact just as Keith finds diapers in the apartment. A reporter contacts Wallace. Sheriff Lamb goes down to Mexico and asks around for Duncan Kane. Keith confronts Veronica about her actions regarding the baby, angry that she used him and tells her he'll never be able to fully trust her again. The FBI agents search Veronica’s apartment, but Keith has removed the diapers and continues to claim he doesn't know anything. Weevil learns that Felix was dating Molly Fitzpatrick. Sheriff Lamb continues his search before finding his trunk unloaded. Duncan, disguised as a hitchhiker, gets picked up by Vinnie Van Lowe and Astrid (Celeste’s assistant), and they drive off into the distance.  Arc significance  *Duncan escapes Neptune and leaves the United States with his baby daughter, Faith Manning, whom he has renamed Lilly. Veronica aided him in this escapade, and when Keith learns about her involvement, he states that he will never be able to trust her again. *Wallace returned to Neptune because he was involved in a drunk driving incident in Chicago. *Weevil and Logan continue to work together to solve Felix's murder and learn that Felix was dating Molly Fitzpatrick.  Production  Series creator Rob Thomas (pictured) wrote and directed the episode. The episode was written and directed by series creator Rob Thomas. Although Thomas had previously written \\"Pilot\\", \\"Credit Where Credit's Due\\", \\"Leave It to Beaver\\", and \\"Normal Is the Watchword\\", this is his first directing credit for the show and his first professional directing credit. In an interview, Thomas expressed nervousness around the shoot, especially when to call \\"Action.\\" Thomas also made sure that he directed an episode that he'd written. When asked about how it came to be that Thomas directed an episode, he replied: Series regular Teddy Dunn (pictured, who portrays Duncan Kane) made his final regular appearance in \\"Donut Run\\". The episode features the final regular appearance by Duncan Kane (played by Teddy Dunn), after his character was written off the series. Duncan would later cameo in the season two finale, \\"Not Pictured\\". Thomas attributed Duncan's departure to the lack of fan interest in Veronica and Duncan's relationship and the more enthusiastic reception to the Veronica-Logan relationship, stating that \\"You know, we had two romantic possibilities for Veronica. One sort of dominated the fans' interest. And it became clear that one suitor won out.\\" From the very beginning of the series, fans had expressed dislike towards the character of Duncan. However, he decided to keep playing the character. In a later interview, he said, \\"Obviously, I acted because I wanted the fans to like the experience. You want your performance to be liked. You don't want to suck. You don't want people to think you suck. That wasn't the goal.\\" Towards the end of the airing of the first season, he stated, \\"I'm going to be there in every episode next season if we get a second season. So people will either continue to hate me or things will change. Things are going to change for Duncan anyway, as the season resolves. There are going to be different sides of him that you're going to get to see.\\" Before going into the filming of season two, Thomas had told Dunn that he was being written off the show, and Dunn did not react badly to the news, as by that point, it \\"was actually a decision\\" for him to return for the second season at all. The episode features a special guest-starring appearance by actress Lucy Lawless as an FBI agent. \\"Donut Run\\" marks the final appearance of recurring character Celeste Kane.  Reception  = Ratings = In its original broadcast, \\"Donut Run\\" received 1.62 million viewers, becoming the lowest-rated episode of the series overall and marking a sharp decrease in 1.8 million viewers from the previous episode, \\"One Angry Veronica\\" and ranking 118th of 121 in the weekly rankings. = Reviews = The episode received critical acclaim. Writing for The A.V. Club, Rowan Kaiser gave the episode a positive review, stating that the characters knowing facts that the audience doesn't worked. \\"'Donut Run' actually does this well, in large part because the heist that we're seeing—Duncan and Veronica stealing the coma baby—requires that Duncan and Veronica stage a breakup, meaning that Veronica seems to be a free, bitter agent for the bulk of the episode.\\" Price Peterson of TV.com heavily praised what he called a \\"great episode\\" and \\"a fitting send-off for Duncan\\". He elaborated that \\"as much as he and Veronica were a good match, there's only so much you can do dramatically with a happy relationship, you know? I'm kind of glad she's back to being a free agent again.\\" Amy Ratcliffe of IGN called the episode the third best episode of the series, behind \\"Weapons of Class Destruction\\" and \\"Leave It to Beaver\\". The publication stated that \\"this fast- paced episode…had switches and secrets and is a tad reminiscent of Oceans 11\\" and that the characterization of Vinnie Van Lowe was \\"a pleasing little touch.\\" Vulture listed the episode's use of \\"How Can You Mend a Broken Heart\\" by Al Green and \\"Adelaide\\" by The Old 97's on its list of \\"16 Perfect Musical Moments from Veronica Mars\\". Katie Atkinson of Entertainment Weekly ranked \\"Donut Run\\" as one of \\"the 10 essential episodes of Veronica Mars\\", noting \\"The Air That I Breathe\\" by The Hollies as a musical standout. Kath Skerry of Give Me My Remote called the episode the 2nd best of the series, behind \\"Not Pictured\\", writing that \\"This episode is arguably the biggest game-changer of Veronica Mars. It’s also one of the saddest,\\" also writing that it \\"featured one of the most moving scenes of the series.\\" BuzzFeed ranked the episode 14th on its list of the best Veronica Mars episodes, writing that \\"so many great things happen in this one.\\" Reviews were not all positive. Television Without Pity gave a more mixed review, saying that there were \\"quite a few problems\\" with the episode and grading it a B-. The reviewer argued that the episode lacked clarity in the supporting characters' involvement in the story and did not provide a satisfying or realistic conclusion to Veronica and Duncan's relationship. TVLine ranked the episode 40th out of 64 on its list of Veronica Mars episodes.

The general direction of the call-and-repeat describes how the prone person is looking worse and worse, followed by saying \\"she is dying,\\" and, finally, \\"she is dead\\". Variations of the spoken part of the game occur. In a common, modern version, the person being lifted is told a story about their death and asked to imagine it happening to them. This is intended to unsettle the participants, and to convince them that something may have changed making it easier to lift the person than before. All versions of the game end with the phrase \\"light as a feather, stiff as a board\\" chanted by those standing around the \\"dead\\" player as they attempt to lift their companion's body using only their fingertips. Some versions omit the story entirely and only the \\"light as a feather...\\" chant is used. After these repetitions, the person being lifted is described by the group as having become lighter or even entirely weightless. Another variation of the game takes place with one person seated in a chair. Four volunteers agree to stand around the sitter, two on the sitter's left side and the other two on their right. Each of the four places two fingers under each corner of the chair's seat and the four together will attempt to lift the chair and sitter, which generally fails. The volunteers will then perform some small ritual, usually involving rubbing their hands together or circling the chair in various direction (counter-clockwise, walking backwards, etc.) After this ritual, the volunteers hold their hands over the sitter's head to \\"transfer\\" energy into the sitter, which will presumably make them weightless. The lifters then retry lifting the sitter the same way as before. Also, it can be that the lifters lift the person sitting in the chair; doing the rest of the ritual as so but holding at the four main points of the body (Under the knees on each side and under the shoulders.) Explanation of the trick The key to the trick is timing: each of the lifters must apply the lifting force at the same moment. When this is done, the weight of the subject is divided equally between each lifter, requiring each person to contribute only of lift, to raise a person. This is about the same as each person lifting a heavy shopping bag. If the trick is performed without synchronising the lift, it will fail: as participants attempt to lift at slightly different times, they are instead performing a series of lifts by smaller groups, resulting in a much heavier weight per person. This fact may be used as a deliberate form of misdirection from the person explaining the trick, first asking the group to \\"go ahead, try to lift\\" to show that it cannot be done, and then asking them to try again on the count of three, where it succeeds. Some people who remember performing the trick as a child will have exaggerated their memory of the effect, recalling the performance as lifting the subject high into the air for some time, when in reality they would only have lifted them for a moment. History The oldest known account of levitation play comes from the diary of Samuel Pepys (1633–1703), a British naval administrator. Pepys’s account of levitation play comes from a conversation with a friend of his, Mr. Brisband, who claimed to have seen four little girls playing light as a feather, stiff as a board in Bordeaux, France. Pepys’s account of Mr. Brisband’s experience reads: Pepys also spoke of the chant that accompanied this performance. The next recording of the game being played comes from The Magician’s Own Book (1857). This account differs from that of Pepys, as it is a direct account of the game being played. Also, this account focuses on a different version of the game than the version played by the girls in Samuel Pepys’ account. In this account, the heaviest man at a party in Venice, Italy, sits in a chair, and is unable to be lifted by six other persons, initially. However, after coordinated hand-clapping and synchronized inhalations and exhalations, the man in the chair is able to be lifted on the forefingers of the six lifters.Arnold, George. (1862). The Magician’s Own Handbook or The Whole Art of Conjuring. New York: Dick Fitzgerald. The phenomenon has been observed into modern times, often being described as a form of spiritualism or seance and considered anathema by some religious groups. It is widely considered a simple spooky party game along the lines of Bloody Mary and the telling of ghost stories. The game appears in the 1996 film The Craft, which follows the story of four young girls as they familiarize themselves with witchcraft and various arcane experiments—one of which is light as a feather, stiff as a board. In the movie, the girls are seen performing the version of the game described in Samuel Pepys’ diary, which involves one participant lying down, while the others kneel around her. The girls chant “Light as a feather, stiff as a board,” several times before lifting the prone participant into the air. In the movie, this scene involves special effects, which has the effect of the prone participant levitating above the hands of the lifters.

The taps began sometime near the beginning of August 2004 and were removed in March 2005 without discovering the identity of the perpetrators. The phones tapped included those of the Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis and members of his family, the Mayor of Athens, Dora Bakoyannis, most phones of the top officers at the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry for Public Order, members of the ruling party, ranking members of the opposition Panhellenic Socialist Movement party (PASOK), the Hellenic Navy General Staff, the previous Minister of Defense and one phone of a locally hired Greek American employee of the American Embassy. Phones of Athens-based Arab businessmen were also tapped. Foreign and Greek media have raised United States intelligence agencies as the main suspects. AFP reported that one Greek official stated on background that the likely initial penetration occurred during the run-up to the 2004 Athens Olympics, stating: \\"it is evident that the wiretaps were organized by foreign intelligence agencies, for security reasons related to the 2004 Olympic Games.\\" The leader of the PASOK socialist opposition George Papandreou said that the Greek government itself had pointed towards the US as responsible for the wiretaps by giving up the zone of listening range, in which the US embassy was included. In 2015, after an investigation lasting 10 years, Greek investigators have found conclusive evidence linking the wiretapping to the US Embassy in Athens. As a result of the investigation, Greek authorities have issued an arrest warrant for a certain William George Basil, a NSA operative from a Greek immigrant background. Exploitation of Vodafone's network Ericsson AXE The Ericsson switches used by Vodafone Greece were compromised and unauthorized software was installed that made use of legitimate tapping modules, known as \\"lawful interception\\", while bypassing the normal monitoring and logging that would take place when a legal tap is set up. This software was eventually found to be installed on four of Vodafone's Ericsson AXE telephone exchanges. In modern mobile telecommunication networks, legal wiretaps, known as lawful interceptions, are performed at the switch. Ericsson AXE telephone exchanges support lawful intercepts via the remote-control equipment subsystem (RES), which carries out the tap, and the interception management system (IMS), software used for initiating addition of the tap to the RES database. In a fully operating lawful interception system the RES and IMS both create logs of all numbers being tapped, allowing system administrators to perform audits in order to find unauthorized taps. To successfully wiretap phone numbers without detection, as the intruders did, a special set of circumstances had to be present. The RES had to be active on the exchange, but the IMS had to be unused. At the time of the illegal wiretaps, Vodafone had not yet purchased the lawful intercept options, meaning the IMS was not present on their systems. However, an earlier exchange software upgrade had included the RES. In addition, the intruders needed to continue to have access to the exchange software to change tapped numbers, without alerting system administrators that the exchange had been modified. Normally, all changes to exchange software would be logged. To get around this, the intruders installed a rootkit on the exchange, a piece of software that would modify the exchange software on the fly to hide all changes and, in case of an audit, to make the exchange appear as though it had been untouched. When one of the tapped phones made or received a phone call, the exchange, or switch, sent a duplication of the conversation to one of fourteen anonymous prepaid mobile phones. As these phones are not associated with a contract, retrieving details of their owners is very difficult. About half of the intercepting phones were activated between June and August 2004. The base stations that serviced those phones were in an area near the center of Athens. Discovery of illegal taps On January 24, 2005, an intruder update of exchange software resulted in customer text messages not being sent. Vodafone Greece sent firmware dumps of the affected exchanges to Ericsson for analysis. On March 4, 2005, Ericsson located the rogue code, 6500 lines of code written in the PLEX programming language used by Ericsson AXE switches. Writing such sophisticated code in a very esoteric language required a high level of expertise. Much of Ericsson's software development for AXE had been done by an Athens-based company named Intracom Telecom, so the skills needed to write the rogue software were likely available within Greece. On March 7, 2005, Ericsson notified Vodafone of the existence of rogue wiretaps and software in their systems. The next day the general manager of the Greek Vodafone branch, George Koronias, asked for the software to be removed and deactivated. Because the rogue software was removed before law enforcement had an opportunity to investigate, the perpetrators were likely alerted that their software had been found and had ample opportunity to turn off the \\"shadow\\" phones to avoid detection. According to the head of Greece's intelligence service, Ioannis Korantis: \\"From the moment that the software was shut down, the string broke that could have lead us to who was behind this.\\" On March 9, the Network Planning Manager for Vodafone Greece, Kostas Tsalikidis, was found dead in an apparent suicide. According to several experts questioned by the Greek press, Tsalikidis was a key witness in the investigation of responsibility of the wiretaps. Family and friends believe there are strong indications he was the person who first discovered that highly sophisticated software had been secretly inserted into the Vodafone network. Tsalikidis had been planning for a while to quit his Vodafone job but told his fiancée not long before he died that it had become \\"a matter of life or death\\" that he leave, says the family's lawyer, Themis Sofos. There is speculation that either he committed suicide because of his involvement in the tapping of the phones, or he was murdered because he had discovered, or was about to discover, who the perpetrators were. After a four-month investigation of his death, Supreme Court prosecutor Dimitris Linos said that the death of Tsalikidis was directly linked to the scandal. \\"If there had not been the phone tapping, there would not have been a suicide,\\" he said. In November, 2007, press reports in Greece quoted the Tsalikidis family attorney, Themistokles Sofos, as saying they had commenced legal action against Vodafone, \\"suspect[ing] he was poisoned\\". On March 10 Koronias asked to meet Prime Minister Karamanlis to discuss matters of national security. At 20:00 on the same day he presented the facts to the Minister of Public Order and the Prime Minister's chief of staff, and on the next day he presented them to the Prime Minister. A preliminary judicial investigation was carried out, which, due to the complexity of the case, lasted until February 1, 2006. The preliminary investigation did not point out any persons connected with the case. The investigation was hindered by the fact that Vodafone disabled the interception system, and therefore locating the intercepting phones was no longer possible (the phones were apparently switched off), and that Vodafone had incorrectly purged all access logs. Police rounded up and questioned as suspects persons who called the monitoring phones, but all callers claimed they called these phones because their number was previously used by another person. Ericsson has checked their equipment in other markets world-wide and has not found the illegal software installed anywhere else. \\"As far as Ericsson knows, this is a unique incident. We have never discovered anything like this before or since.\\" Vodafone spokesman Ben Padovan said. Fallout The investigation into the matter was further hampered when Greek law enforcement officials began to make accusations at both Vodafone and Ericsson, which forced experts on the defensive. A recent appeal of the main opposition party, PASOK, to form an investigating parliamentary committee was rejected by the governing party. In December 2006 Vodafone Greece was fined €76 million by the Communications Privacy Protection Authority, a Greek privacy watchdog group, for the illegal wiretapping of 106 cellphones. The fine was calculated as €500,000 for each phone that was eavesdropped on, as well as a €15 million fine for impeding their investigation. On October 19, 2007, Vodafone Greece was again fined €19 million by EETT, the national telecommunications regulator, for alleged breach of privacy rules. On September 2011, new evidence emerged indicated the US Embassy in Athens was behind the telephone interceptions. The key evidence of complicity was that out of the 14 anonymous prepaid mobile phones used for the interception, three had been purchased by the same person at the same time as a fourth one. The fourth phone called mobile phones and landlines registered with the US Embassy in Athens. With a sim card registered to the US Embassy, it also called two telephone numbers in Ellicott City and Cantonsville, Maryland, both NSA bedroom communities. A criminal investigation was launched,\\"Translation: USA Espionage against Greece\\", WikiLeaks Press, September 23, 2013\\"Courtcase Evidence: USA Espionage against Greece\\", WikiLeaks Press, September 23, 2013. Retrieved 2013-09-23 and in February 2015, Greek investigators were finally able to finger a suspect, William George Basil, a NSA operative from a Greek immigrant background. Greek authorities have issued a warrant for Basil's arrest, who has since gone into hiding.

He is a right- handed batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler, who played for the Victorian Bushrangers from season 2000/01 to 2006/07. Biography Moss was born in Sydney, where his parents had emigrated to from England only a few years before, and is Jewish.\\"Jews and cricket\\" - Jerusalem Post\\"A history of Jewish first-class cricketers\\"  Maccabi AJAX Cricket Club His older brother, Phil Moss, was born in London, and has been notable in Australian soccer circles as both a player and a manager. Prior to his first-class debut, Moss played for Australia in the Maccabiah Games in Israel, a competition in which the best Jewish sportsmen from around the world compete representing their country. The bridge collapsed as Moss and the Australian team was walking on the bridge in Tel Aviv on the way to the opening games, killing four people. Moss fell into the river. Early career The Sydney native first played cricket for Hampshire's Second XI in one game in 2000, before moving back to his home country and playing for Victoria, as he was unable to crack the New South Wales squad. His performance as a middle-order batsman in the Victorian team assisted them to the finals of the 2000–01 and 2003–04 Pura Cup finals; Moss averaged around 60 for the tournament. Moss then moved to England, where he appeared almost two months later for Derbyshire for the first time. He struggled to make himself a part of the first team during his first two seasons at the club, and made a failed transfer request to return to New South Wales. Later highlights In season 2005/06 international selection was suggested by numerous journalists (such as Darren Berry), after a strong start to the season with both bat and ball, but his age of 32 was seen as a barrier, and it never eventuated. However, he finished off an excellent season with 295 runs (at an average of 29.50) in the ING Cup, and 413 (at an average of 27) runs in the Pura Cup, plus 20 wickets in the same competition, as Victoria made the Pura Cup final. In 2006/07 he faced an inconsistent season in Pura Cup cricket, scoring just 149 runs (at an average of 18.62), whilst his medium pacers proved handy, taking 14 wickets (at 28.14) in a decent return, but it was not enough to make Moss a permanent fixture, and he was in and out of the side at times. Moss was more consistent in the renamed Ford Ranger (OD) cup, scoring 344 runs (at 31.27), playing every match, but failing to score a century. Moss is also an accomplished golfer, playing off single figures and taking the trophy at this year's Tin Cup XI Golf Tournament at the Mollymook Hilltops Golf Club on the NSW South Coast. At the end of his agreed one-year contract it was amicably agreed to part ways with Victoria and he returned to Sydney in 2007, bringing to a close a career which featured 4482 first-class runs (at 35.01), with 7 centuries and 30 half centuries, the honour of being vice captain and stand in captain, in a match which brought upon his highest ever FC score of 172 (not out), and 131 wickets (at 33.93) in FC cricket as well. On his return he played for the Sydney Cricket Club (formerly UTS Balmain) in Sydney Grade Cricket. By 2011 he was putting his skills to use with sportsgear maker Puma SE Australia, as a well regarded motivating speaker and as part of the Fox Sports Cricket Commentary Team.

The Kababish comprise about 19 different groups, which are all led by a single nazir or chief. Their main occupation is as camel herders, which gives them a high standing in Arabic society as camels are highly prized and valued. Background A Kababish man The main religion of the Kababish is Islam, adhering to the Sunni denomination. They trace descent from Arabian forefathers, and speak a form of Sudanese Arabic. Women classically dress in a long blue cloth wrapped a few times around their body, while the men wear long white tunics, loose white pants and white turbans. Most men will carry a dagger or sword and perhaps a rifle or shotgun, due to the harshness of desert life and the threat of banditry due to their valuable stock. Herders The Libyan Desert, a common migration route for Kababish and camels From a young age children start to work at herding camels for water and feeding. What makes the Kababish stand out from other nomads is that the tribe does not all move together, often the women will stay at their camps or dikkas while the men move north towards the Libyan desert. The Home The Kababish's home is a simple place made of canvas or cloth walls and roofs made of camel hairs and hides. Inside will be a few ornaments and a large bed raised off the ground and bound together by leather straps. Meat, berries and whatever can be traded makes up the diet, as well as the Arabic staple of spiced tea. Modern Times Since the famine in the 1980s life has become more strenuous for the Kababish, which has seen many turn towards the cities or take up a more semi-nomadic life. Today the tribe is estimated to be anywhere between 70,000 and 350,000, most of whom are illiterate.

It is named after the chemists Akira Hosomi and Hideki Sakurai. The Sakurai reaction Lewis acid activation is essential for complete reaction. Strong Lewis acids such as titanium tetrachloride, boron trifluoride, tin tetrachloride, and AlCl(Et)2 are all effective in promoting the Hosomi reaction. The reaction is a type of electrophilic allyl shift with formation of an intermediate beta-silyl carbocation. Driving force is the stabilization of said carbocation by the beta-silicon effect. Various reactions The Hosomi-Sakurai reaction can be performed on a number of functional groups. An electrophilic carbon, activated by a Lewis acid, is required. Below is a list of different functional groups that can be used in the Hosomi–Sakurai reaction. Mechanism Figure 1: Hosomi-Sakurai reaction showing allylation of a ketone Figure 2: Hosomi- Sakurai reaction showing allylation of an enone The Hosomi-Sakurai reactions are allylation reactions which involve use of allyl silanes as allylmetal reagents. This section demonstrates examples of allylation of different ketone groups. In figure 1, allylation of a carbonyl ketone (compound containing a ketone group and two different functional groups) has been shown. In the given reaction, the electrophilic compound (carbon with a ketone group) is treated with titanium tetrachloride, a strong Lewis acid and allyltrimethylsilane. According to the general principle, the Lewis acid first activates the electrophilic carbon in presence of allyltrimethylsilane which then undergoes nucleophilic attack from electrons on the allylic silane. The silicon plays the key role in stabilizing the carbocation of carbon at the β-position. Hosomi-Sakurai reaction is also applicable for other functional groups such as enones, where conjugate addition is usually seen. In figure 2, the Hosomi- Sakurai reaction has been shown using a cinnamoyl ketone. This reaction follows the same mechanism as the previous reaction shown here. Beta-silicon effect stabilization As displayed in the mechanism, the Hosomi–Sakurai reaction goes through a secondary carbocation intermediate. Secondary carbocations are inherently unstable, however the β-silicon effect from the silicon atom stabilizes the carbocation. Silicon is able to donate into an empty p-orbital, and the silicon orbital is shared between the two carbons. This stabilizes the positive charge over 3 orbitals. Another term for the β-silicon effect is silicon-hyperconjugation. This interaction is essential for the reaction to go to completion.

Biography  =Education and early career= Connolly graduated with a BA in English from Trinity College, Dublin,https://www.tcd.ie/courses/undergraduate/az/course.php?id=DUBJH- ENLT-1JH and a Masters in journalism from Dublin City University.http://www.shotsmag.co.uk/author_view.aspx?author_id=2 Before becoming a full-time novelist, he worked as a journalist, a barman, a local government official, a waiter and a gofer at Harrods department store in London.http://www.darleyanderson.com/authors/john-connolly =Writing career= After five years as a freelance journalist for The Irish Times newspaper, he became frustrated with the profession, and began to write his first novel, Every Dead Thing, in his spare time (he continues to contribute articles to the paper, most frequently interviews with other established authors).https://www.irishtimes.com/news/laurel-wreath-for-a-woman-1.142325 Every Dead Thing introduced readers to the anti-hero Charlie Parker, a former police officer hunting the killer of his wife and daughter. It was nominated for the Bram Stoker Award for Best First Novel and went on to win the 2000 Shamus Award for Best First Private Eye Novel, making Connolly the first author outside of the US to win. Connolly has since written further books in the Parker series, 19 as of 2019, and a non-Parker thriller, as well as venturing outside of the crime genre with the publication of first, an anthology of ghost stories and later, a novel about a young boy's coming-of- age journey through a fantasy realm during World War II England. Film and television adaptations of his works are currently in development; the earliest to appear to audiences was partially based on the short story \\"The New Daughter\\", and starred Kevin Costner and Ivana Baquero. Connolly also tours to promote the launch of his books. In 2007, he made book store appearances in Ireland, United Kingdom, United States, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Taiwan to promote The Unquiet. John Connolly signing a copy of The Black Angel, 2005 The seventh book in the Charlie Parker series, The Reapers, was published in 2008. It differs from the earlier books in that the story is told from the point of view of Parker's close friends and allies in combat, Louis and Angel. Louis and Angel are an unlikely couple whose quibbles and good humour are sometimes the source of comic relief. Louis is an enigmatic, large black man who was a hired killer but who now seems to be in semiretirement; Angel is a small part-Latino man and ex-burglar. They appear episodically throughout the Charlie Parker books as his only close friends, revealing themselves when Parker is in need of help and professional protection from his enemies. The ninth Parker novel, titled The Whisperers, was published in 2010; the tenth, The Burning Soul, in 2011. The Wrath of Angels, the eleventh Charlie Parker novel, was published by Hodder & Stoughton in the UK in August 2012, and was released by Atria/Emily Bestler Books in the US on 1 January 2013. The Wolf in Winter, published in 2014, represented a shift from Charlie Parker's customary first-person narration to a third-person point of view, a shift that continues in A Song of Shadows (2015) and A Time of Torment (2016). A Book of Bones (2019) marks the end of the sequence that began with the novella \\"The Fractured Atlas,\\" included in Night Music: Nocturnes Vol. 2 (2015), and is a true sequel to The Woman in the Woods. 2009 marked the publication of Connolly's first novel specifically for younger readers, The Gates. A sequel was published in 2011 as Hell's Bells in the UK and as The Infernals in the US. The third book in the Samuel Johnson series, The Creeps, was published in 2013. Connolly also collaborated with his partner, journalist Jennifer Ridyard, on The Chronicles of the Invaders, a fantasy trilogy for teen readers: Conquest (2013), Empire (2015), and Dominion (2016). Connolly collaborated with fellow Irish author Declan Burke to edit Books to Die For: The World's Greatest Mystery Writers on the World's Greatest Mystery Novels, a nonfiction anthology published in August 2012 by Hodder & Stoughton and in October 2013 by Atria/Emily Bestler Books. Books to Die For was nominated for an Edgar Award by the Mystery Writers of America, won the Agatha Award for Best Non-fiction, and won the Anthony Award for Best Critical Nonfiction Work. In 2017, Connolly turned a decades-long fascination with the comedian Stan Laurelhttps://www.newstatesman.com/culture/film/2017/08/love-affairs-stan- laurel-if-i-had-do-it-over-again-things-would-be-different into the novel he, a fictional exploration of the comedian's last yearshttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/books/review/john-connolly-he.html. Horror Express, a monograph based on the 1972 filmhttps://lovehorror.co.uk/horror-features/100-pages-of-horror-horror- express-by-john-connolly/, was nominated for a Bram Stoker Award for Superior Achievement in Non-Fiction.http://thebramstokerawards.org/  Themes  Connolly was drawn to the tradition of American crime fiction, because it seemed the best medium through which he could explore the issues of compassion, morality, reparation and salvation. He credits veteran authors Ross Macdonald, James Lee Burke, and Ed McBain as influences, and is often praised for writing in a rich and introspective style of prose.

Vidal-Naquet was a specialist in the study of Ancient Greece, but was also interested (and deeply involved) in contemporary history, particularly the Algerian War (1954–62), during which he opposed the use of torture by the French Army, as well as Jewish history. Having participated with Michel Foucault and Jean-Marie Domenach in the founding of the Groupe d'information sur les prisons (GIP), one of the first French new social movements, he criticized negationism. Vidal-Naquet, who never abandoned his fascination with Antiquity, was also a supporter of Middle East peace efforts. Biography Vidal-Naquet's family belonged to the Sephardic Jewish community rooted in the Comtat Venaissin (Carpentras, Avignon). He was born in Paris, and he was raised in bourgeois, Republican and secular environment. His father Lucien was a lawyer, of \\"Dreyfusard\\" temperament, who quickly entered the Resistance in order to avoid exile. In June 1940, the family moved to Marseille. Arrested by the Gestapo on 15 May 1944, Vidal-Naquet's father was deported, along with his wife, in June 1944. They were sent to Auschwitz, where they died. At 14 years old, Pierre Vidal-Naquet then hid in his grandmother's house in the Drôme. There, he read a lot, including the Iliad, and came to know his cousin, the philosopher Jacques Brunschwig. He later learnt that the Nazis had made \\"his father dance,\\" something he would never forget. After his studies at the lycée Carnot in Paris, he specialized in the history of Ancient Greece, as well as in contemporary subjects such as the Algerian War (1954–1962) and the Holocaust. He read Marc Bloch's Strange Defeat, a book attempting to explain the causes of the defeat during the 1940 Battle of France, which is one of the origins of his vocation as a historian. He discovered surrealism (André Breton, René Char and also Antonin Artaud), and founded a review at 18 years old, along with Pierre Nora, Imprudence. The 1949 Rajk trial definitively took out his will to adhere to the French Communist Party (PCF). Pierre Vidal-Naquet first taught history at Orléans's high school (1955), before going to Caen's university (1956–60) and then Lille (1961–62). Reading Dumézil and Lévi-Strauss, he would become a member of the \\"Paris School\\", originally composed of Jean-Pierre Vernant, Nicole Loraux, Marcel Detienne and himself. Their work would renew approaches to the study of Ancient Greece. He then worked at the CNRS (1962–64) and was named maître de conférences at the University of Lyon (1964–66). He was then named professor at the École pratique des hautes études, which became the EHESS. Vidal-Naquet co-authored several books with Jean-Pierre Vernant, with whom he was friends. However, although Vernant was a \\"comrade\\" of the French Communist Party (PCF), Vidal-Naquet never belonged to any political party, with the exception of the Unified Socialist Party (PSU), which he considered a \\"mere discussion circle.\\"“Le Dernier des dreyfusards”, article on Vidal-Naquet in Le Figaro, September 6, 2004 Pierre Vidal-Naquet was married and the father of three children. He was also officer of the Légion d'honneur and, in Greece, commander of the Phenix Order. Pierre Vidal-Naquet was an atheist.\\"In 1950 Vidal-Naquet declared to his future wife Genevive Railhac that \\"as an atheist, history is for me the only possible substitute for religion\\".\\" Oswyn Murray, Obituary: Pierre Vidal-Naquet, The Independent (London), August 4, 2006, Pg. 43. Activism Pierre Vidal-Naquet defined himself as an \\"activist historian\\", and while pursuing his studies never ceased engaging in political struggles and taking part in political committees, etc. A member of the Comité Audin, along with Jérôme Lindon (editor of the Minuit publishing house), he was one of the best known opponents of the use of torture by the French Army during the Algerian War (1954–62). Along with Jean-Paul Sartre and 119 others, he signed the Manifesto of the 121, a call for civil disobedience against the Algerian war. As an anti-colonialist, Vidal-Naquet was opposed to Guy Mollet's French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) reformist party because of Mollet's support of the First Indochina War and Algerian War. He was also opposed to the Regime of the Colonels (1967–74) in Greece. He supported peace efforts in the Middle East as well as the Europalestine group. He thus declared: \\"I consider Sharon a criminal.\\" With Michel Foucault and Jean-Marie Domenach, on 8 February 1971 he signed the manifesto of the Groupe d'informations sur les prisons, which, rather than speaking in the name of prisoners, aimed to give back to them the chance of speaking in their own voice. Vidal-Naquet was also active in condemning denial of the Armenian Genocide. Vidal-Naquet, who had answered or criticized Holocaust negationist Robert Faurisson in several of his works, once employed Faurisson as an example to illustrate \\"what the Armenian minorities might feel\\": > Let us imagine a negationist Robert Faurisson as a governmental minister, a > Faurisson president of the Republic, a Faurisson general, a Faurisson > ambassador, a Faurisson president of the Turkish Historical Commission and a > member of the senate of the University of Istanbul, a Faurisson member of > the United Nations, a Faurisson responding in the press each time the > question of the Jews is raised. In brief, a state-sponsored Faurisson paired > with an international Faurisson and, along with all that, a Talaat-Himmler > blessed, since 1943, with an official mausoleum in the country's > capital.Vidal-Naquet, Pierre. The Jews: History, Memory, and the Present. > 1996, page 169 Vidal-Naquet was one of the first scholars to deconstruct historical revisionism, notably in The Assassins of Memory and Reflexions on Genocide. He was also opposed to the 23 February 2005 French law on colonialism passed by the conservative Union for a Popular Movement (UMP), but which was finally repealed by president Jacques Chirac in the beginning of 2006. Vidal-Naquet also criticized the 1990 Gayssot Act which prohibits revisionist discourse, claiming that the law shouldn't interfere in historical matters.Interview with Vidal-Naquet on the Human Rights League (LDH) website Vidal-Naquet's arguments against legislation relating to historical studies is not, however, a door opened to revisionist speech. He once declared that he would rather name revisionists \\"negationists\\", and that he wouldn't engage with them for \\"simple and scientific reasons. An astronomer doesn't debate with an astrologer. I wouldn't discuss with someone who supports the idea that the moon is made of Roquefort ... it is impossible.\\"“Au service du racisme”, in L'Humanité, 7 June 1990 Criticism While his analyses e.g. of Greek tragedy and the institution of the Athenian ephebia has been favourably received by many French intellectuals, they have been violently challenged elsewhere, particularly by Italian philologists who, like Vidal-Naquet himself, were favourably inclined towards a Marxist analysis. His structuralist approach has been called ahistorical, his analyses of the texts as lacking in thoroughness and even manipulative, using categories like polysemy and ambiguity which his critics found do not apply.Vincenzo Di Benedetto, Il Filottete e l'efebia secondo Vidal-Naquet, in: Belfagor 33 (1978), p. 191-207; see also Vincenzo Di Benedetto, L'ambiguo nella tragedia greca: una categoria fuorviante, in: Euripide \\"Medea\\", introd. di V.

Little Flower Junior College  Little Flower Junior College is a Catholic minority institution established by the Montfort Brothers of St. Gabriel. At present the College buildings comprise two imposing four storied-blocks. Spacious grounds and plenty of greenery all round, give the college an impressive look and create a congenial atmosphere for academic pursuits. From about 200 students when the college functioned in the school premises, today the number of students has risen to 1600.  History  Little Flower Junior College was established in 1974 by upgrading the High School of the same name in Abids, Hyderabad. The need for the college arose as a result of a change in the Government's education policy. The multipurpose scheme was given up in favor of the Junior college systems The interest shown by the chief Minister Mr. Vengal Rao, led to the grant of a piece of land in Ranga Reddy District and LFJC began to take shape. There was an initial difficulty in the form of paucity of funds. So LFJC began its life in the school premises itself with two sections, one each of MPC and BPC. The college functioned there for eight years. Work on the building at Uppal, was taken up in 1980. The late Bro. James Pannivelil was placed in charge, Mr. Srinath Magal was the Engineer and Architect, and the college shifted to its present premises on 1 July 1982. A small auditorium was built in 1989. An additional floor on top of the office block was finished in 1998 Co-education was introduced in 1997.

Pilots can find RCO frequencies in charts or publications such as the Chart Supplement or Canada Flight Supplement. The RCO is used to make a radio call to the outlet as if the pilot were making the call directly to the FSS or FIC. The outlet will relay the call (and the briefer's response) automatically. RCOs are sometimes confused with RTRs, or remote transmitter/receivers. In fact, the difference between the two is subtle. While RCOs serve flight service stations, RTRs serve terminal air traffic control facilities. RCOs and RTRs may be UHF or VHF and are divided into a variety of classes determined by the number of transmitters or receivers. Classes A through G are used mainly for air/ground communications. Class O facilities were created specifically to provide ground-to-ground communication between air traffic controllers and pilots located at satellite airports. The idea was to create a way for pilots to receive en-route clearances or departure authorizations and cancel IFR flight plans. Class O RTRs also were intended to allow pilots flying below the coverage of the primary air/ground frequency to continue to receive advisories from air traffic control. Class O facilities are non-protected outlets and are subject to prolonged outages which may go undetected and unreported. There is also a special variant of RCO which in Canada is called a Dial-up Remote Communications Outlet (DRCO) and in the U.S. is called a Ground communication outlet (GCO). DRCOs and GCOs connect to an FIC or FSS over a phone line, and pilots initiate the connection by keying their microphones in a prescribed pattern.

Khattuni is in the west Khattuni is located on the left bank of the Khatuni River, a right tributary of the Dzhalka River. It is located north-west of the village of Vedeno. The nearest settlements to Khattuni are Elistanzhi in the south-east, Makhkety in the south-west, Tevzana in the west, and Agishty in the north-west.  Name  The name \\"Khottanye\\" translates roughly from Chechen as \\"swampy\\" or \\"muddy\\".  History  In 1944, after the deportation of the Chechen and Ingush people and the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was abolished, the village of Khattuni was renamed to Konkhidatli, and settled by people from the neighboring republic of Dagestan. From 1944 to 1957, it was a part of the Vedensky District of the Dagestan ASSR. In 1958, after the Vaynakh people returned and the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was restored, the village regained its old Chechen name, Khottanye.

The garagistes refers to a group of winemakers in the Bordeaux region, producing \\"vins de garage\\", \\"garage wine\\". A group emerged in the mid-1990s in reaction to the traditional style of red Bordeaux wine, which is highly tannic and requires long ageing in the bottle to become drinkable. The garagistes developed a style more consistent with perceived international wine tastes. For red wines this means \\"bigger, bolder, fruitier wines, often with sometimes a higher alcohol content.\\" The new style for white wines is a more pronounced oak taste with some residual sugar. This new style of wine is controversial, and purists claim that the wines will not age well and they don't reflect well the terroir of the region, nor the typicity of the grape varieties used. Characterised as \\"winemaker's wine whose attributes reflect a disregard for the traditional handling of its particular terroir\\", the term is sometimes used somewhat as a backhanded compliment; in light of this, vins de garage wines come from previously unknown estates without proven track record or pedigree. Alternately, such wine is referred to as \\"super-cuvée\\" or \\"microchâteau\\". The wines produced by these estates often receive very high wine ratings from Robert Parker, and are usually sold at prices driven high by rarity, hyperbole, and fashion.winepros.com.au. History Many notable garagiste wines come from the Bordeaux wine regions of Saint-Émilion (pictured) and Pomerol. Considered a predecessor of the garage wine, Château Le Pin founded by the Belgians Marcel and Gérard Thienpont on less than two hectares in the late 1970s, wine was produced by microcuvée from a farmhouse basement in Pomerol. Following the efforts of Jean-Luc Thunevin and Murielle Andraud, and the emergence of Château Valandraud came the description of a \\"movement\\". Founded in 1989 on a 1 hectare plot in Saint-Émilion, with limited funds for equipment, much work was done primitively by hands and feet in their garage, with high detail labour resulting in low output yields defining the methods of the model. Several wines fashioned in this same model appeared on the market, such as La Mondotte from Château Canon-la-Gaffelière, La Gomerie from Château Beau-Séjour-Bécot, Le Dôme, Vieux Château Mazerat, Les Astéries and Le Carré from Château Teyssier, Quinault L'Enclos, Rol Valentin, Barde- Haut, Gracia, L'Hermitage and Marojallia. The terms \\"Vins du garage\\" and \\"Garagistes\\" have been attributed to French writers Nicholas Baby and Michel Bettane.Jean-Luc Thunevin's Blog, November 26, 2007 After Robert Parker rated Valandraud a better 1995 vintage than Pétrus, the economic effects were substantial. Developments in the market saw Garage wines attain surprisingly high prices, sometimes well beyond historically top-priced products. However, the early 2000s saw indications of a reverse in the trend. Wine writer Jancis Robinson noted that the Garage wine market had \\"shrivelled considerably in recent years\\", and Robert Parker stated that while the wines are \\"here to stay ... only the best will survive.\\" Steven Spurrier commented further, \\"the belief that ridiculously low yields make better wine has finally been exploded by the quality of [the abundant] 2004, as it should have been by 2000, 1996 and 1990. Goodbye to a fad.\\" The American garagiste movement received its first exposure in 2011 at the inaugural Garagiste Festival in Paso Robles, California. Paso Robles represents the core of the garagiste movement, according to WinesVinesDATA. It lists some 127 wineries with annual production of 1,000 or fewer cases in Paso's home county, San Luis Obispo (SLO). Every year dozens of artisan winemakers pour at the non-profit festival. Criticism Some of the criticism for vins de garage is that with their high prices and limited production, they appear to be made more for wine collectors rather than for wine drinkers. Despite the critical acclaim and high prices that have been fetched by some vins de garage, both the term and the movement have faced criticism. In addition to wine experts such as Steven Spurrier described it a fad, some writers, noted by Graham Harding, have gone so far as to suggest the cult following of these wines are an example of \\"The Emperor's New Clothes syndrome\\" and that the wines are made more for collectors than for wine drinkers.G. Harding \\"A Wine Miscellany\\" pg 102-103, Clarkson Potter Publishing, New York 2005 Another critic is Master of Wine Michael Palij, who compares garagistes, particularly those of Château Valandraud, to the large California wine producer E & J Gallo Winery saying \\"Each is a triumph of style over substance.

A longstanding misconception was that George Sinclair, a nephew of the George Sinclair, 5th Earl of Caithness was the commander of the forces; in fact, he was subordinate to Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Ramsay.The Battle of Kringen, 26th August 1612 (Iain Laird) Background The Scottish forces (Skottetoget) were partly recruited, partly pressed into service by Sir James Spens, apparently against the preferences of James VI, who favored the Danish side in the war. Two ships sailed from Dundee and Caithness in early August, met up on the Orkney Islands and sailed for Norway. Because sea routes had been blocked by Danish forces in the Kalmar War, the Scots decided to follow a land route to Sweden that other Scottish and Dutch forces had successfully used. On 20 August the ships landed in Isfjorden in Romsdal, though the pilot apparently put the forces on shore in rough terrain. The soldiers proceeded to march up the valley of Romsdalen and down into the Gudbrandsdal. Having been warned of the incursion, and probably inflamed by a massacre of Norwegian conscripts at Nya Lödöse and the events of Mönnichhoven’s march (Mönnichhoven-marsjen) earlier in July, the farmers and peasants of the Vågå, Lesja, Dovre, Fron, and Ringebu mobilized to meet the enemy. Legend has it that the sheriff of the area, Lars Gunnarson Hågå ( 1570 – 1650), came into the church in Dovre with a battle axe, struck it on the floor, and shouted \\"Let it be known - the enemy has come to our land!\\" (Gjev ljod - fienden har kome til landet!).Lars Gunnarson Hågå (Store norske leksikon) Order of battle As the Scottish forces progressed southward, they were reportedly followed by Norwegian scouts. The Scottish forces included two companies on foot, commanded by George Sinclair and Ramsay. In recent years, it has been argued that the Scots were lightly armed but this is not probable and the bodies were looted afterwards for weapons and belongings. The Norwegians were armed with swords, spears, axes, scythes, a few muskets and some crossbows.Scottish Expedition In Norway IX 1612 (John Beveridge, M.B.E., B.D., F.S.A. Scot.) According to folklore, the force of the Scottish troops was between 900 and 1,100 or more, but historians generally discount the estimate, placing the probable strength as low as 300. The strength of the Norwegian militia troops is estimated to have been no more than 500.The Battle of Kringen, 26th August 1612 (Sinclair's Club of Otta) Combat operations Landing of Scottish Forces at Isfjorden Adolph Tidemand There are few entirely credible accounts of the battle, but the oral history has two Norwegians on horseback following the Scottish troops, possibly on the other side of the valley. One was a woman by the name of Guri, known as Prillar-Guri to posterity; the other was an unnamed man. The man rode his horse facing backward, providing a distraction for the marching troops. When the Scots reached the narrowest section of the Gudbrandsdal at Kringen, Guri blew her horn, signaling the ambush.Prillar Guri (Daughters of Norway) The chosen place of assault is fairly steep, and the river runs close to what would be considered the only passable road at the time. Thus, the Scots would be trapped between the river and the mountain side, which they could not possibly scale. According to folklore, the Norwegian troops let loose logs and rocks down the valley, crushing the marching soldiers, but this is not confirmed. It is known, however, that they shot at the soldiers with crossbows and muskets. Among the first to fall was George Sinclair, apparently shot by a militiaman named Berdon Sejelstad. It is his name that is most commonly associated with the battle. Sinclair was a nephew of the Earl of Caithness and a historical figure in the Clan Sinclair.The Scottish Expedition in Norway in 1612 (Articles on Scottish History) Close combat ensued, the militiamen fighting with swords, axes, scythes, and presumably other improvised weapons. Most of the Scots were killed during the battle. Some may have escaped, but others were captured. All but 14 of around 300 were summarily executed at Kvam in what is now Nord-Fron, the survivors then sent to Christiania for imprisonment. Those killed were thrown into a mass grave at the local cemetery, north of the Scottish barn (Skottelåven), in which captured soldiers had been held; this was later called Skottehaugen (Scottish barrow). Among the survivors were the officers Alexander Ramsay, Sir Henry Bruce, James Moneypenny, and James Scott, who were eventually repatriated. Aftermath and legacy Scottish barn Skottelåven at Klomstad, Kvam in Oppland county, Norway Monument in Otta over the battle site A statue depicting Prillar-Guri is located in the community of Otta, Norway. The peak where she allegedly stood bears her name to this day, and a local broadcasting antenna is symbolically set on the top. A number of places were named after the Scottish incursion, notably along the route. The barn was destroyed by artillery fire during the intense British-German hostilities at Kvam in 1940. Captured Scottish weapons, including a pistol, a Lochaber axe, a broadsword and several basket hilt claymores, were put on display at the Gudbrandsdal War Museum at Kvam (Gudbrandsdal Krigsminnesamling i Kvam) to commemorate the battle. The display also includes a model of one of the Caithness Scots.The Battle of Kringen, 1612 There is evidence that some Scots may have settled in Norway and farm names may confirm that. There is a \\"Sinclair's Club\\" in Otta and there are regular re-enactments of the battle. Sinclair's grave is now a local landmark though the Norwegians at the time sought to desecrate his memory by burying him outside the church walls. Part of the bunad design for this area--known as rutaliv--is reminiscent of the Sinclair red tartan. In literature and music Norwegian poet Edvard Storm wrote a poem that tells the story of the battle, Zinklarvisa (\\"Sinclair’s ballad\\"). Henrik Wergeland wrote a historical tragedy called Sinklars død (The Death of Sinclair). The plotline concerns Sinclair and his lady, telling of the fatal choices that led to the tragic deaths at Kringen. The Norwegian folk-rock band Folque's song \\"Sinclairvise\\" makes use of Storm's poem. The Faroese metal group Týr included a version of this song on their 2008 album Land, called \\"Sinklars Vísa\\". The ballad is still being sung in the Faroe Islands along with the traditional chain dance without any use of musical instruments.Herr Sinklar on Youtube, sung and dance by Havnar Dansifelag, the Faroese dance association of Tórshavn In 2009, the Norwegian rock band Street Legal released an instrumental song called \\"The Battle of Kringen\\" on their album titled Bite the Bullet.

It is managed by the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust. The Ida Darwin Hospital site is situated behind Fulbourn Hospital. It is run and managed by the same trust, with both hospitals sharing the same facilities and staff pool. History =Early history= The Lunacy Act 1845 and County Asylums Act 1845 mandated that all rate-levying authorities must provide a public asylum. In 1848 there was an agreement to set up a pauper lunatic asylum between Fulbourn and Cherry Hinton. The Justices met in Quarter Session of the County and Borough of Cambridge and the Liberty of the Isle of Ely (later known as The Three Bodies) who would have to raise the money to pay for the Asylum. They set up a committee with representatives from the three authorities to be known as The Committee of Visitors. On 30 September 1856 Admiral The Earl of Hardwicke, the Lord Lieutenant of the county and a member of the Visitors committee, laid the foundation stone and builder William Webster completed the construction. The asylum opened on 6 November 1858 as the County Pauper Lunatic Asylum for Cambridgeshire, the Isle of Ely and the Borough of Cambridge. Dr Edward Langdon Bryan was the first Medical Superintendent, and his sister Miss Bryan was matron. One of the earliest performances of the Footlights Revue was an entertainment given by a group of Cambridge University undergraduates, with a cricket match included, at Fulbourn's \\"pauper lunatic asylum\\" in 1883. After 1939 the hospital also served Huntingdonshire. A county asylum for Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and Huntingdonshire was originally erected near Arlesey in 1858. It opened in 1860 and was known as the Three Counties Asylum. This became Fairfield Hospital in 1960 and it finally closed in 1999. Patients from the then Soke of Peterborough, including the \\"Northamptonshire Peasant Poet\\" John Clare, were committed to Northampton General Lunatic Asylum. In 1876, Northampton County Lunatic Asylum (later Northampton Mental Hospital, then St Crispin's Hospital which closed in 1995) opened for pauper patients and the original general asylum changed its name to Northampton General Lunatic Asylum for the Middle and Upper Classes. This became St Andrew's Hospital for mental diseases in 1887. =International prominence= During the 1960s, Fulbourn Hospital became internationally prominent for its pioneering therapeutic community, under Dr David Clark, who was the last holder of the title of Medical Superintendent, and later Consultant for the Cambridge Psychiatric Rehabilitation Service. In 1976, an Academic Department of Psychiatry was established (as part of the new Cambridge University Clinical School). Headed by Professor Sir Martin Roth (with G. E. Berrios as University Lecturer), the Department took clinical charge of half of the old Friends Ward, rendered the Hospital into a national training centre, organized rotations, and ran the regional MRCPsych course. =Recent developments= After a major refurbishment programme in early 2013, the new Mulberry wards have replaced Adrian House, Friends Ward and Cedars Recovery Unit, as part of the new 3-3-3 model introduced at Fulbourn. The model is made up of three stages – three days’ assessment (at Mulberry 1), three weeks of treatment (at Mulberry 2) and three months of recovery (at Mulberry 3). This new system sets out for patients what care they will receive at each stage of their treatment and for how long they can expect to stay on each ward. From day one, patients work with staff to look at their treatment and recovery so they can get themselves back into the community as soon as they are able. Services Services at the hospital are provided within specialist wards: Adult Mental Health Wards *Mulberry 1 - 14 bed assessment unit for adults aged 17–65. It has 11 acute psychiatric beds and 3 alcohol and opiate detoxification beds. *Mulberry 2 - 16 bed assessment, treatment, care and recovery unit for adults aged 17–65. *Mulberry 3- 16-bed recovery unit for adults aged 17–65. Specialist Mental Health Wards *Springbank Ward - 12-bed unit providing in-patient psychiatric service for women with personality disorders. Forensic Mental Health Services *George McKenzie House - 20 bed Low security ward for people whose condition and/or current legal status makes it difficult for them to be nursed on open wards. Older peoples' Mental Health Services *Willow Ward - 18 beds for patients over 65 that have an acute functional mental health illness. *Denbigh Ward - 18 beds for residents of Cambridgeshire over 65 who are living with dementia. Ida Darwin Hospital From 1960 the land behind the original hospital was used for new learning disability wards, as well offices and out-buildings. Today The Ida Darwin Hospital forms part of Fulbourn Hospital and houses a number of child and adolescent wards, a learning disability ward as well as various community teams and office buildings. The wards are as follows: *Darwin Centre for Young People - 14 bed residential assessment and treatment unit for those aged between 12-17 who are suffering from mental health illnesses. *Phoenix Centre - specialist 14 bed residential treatment unit for those aged between 11-17 who suffer with complex eating disorders and whose needs can not be met by generic child and adolescent mental health services. * The Croft Child and Family Unit - a specialist and unique intensive in-patient and day-patient service for children under 13 and their families. The ward offers 12 residential places for children and their accompanying families. It is the only NHS in-patient service for children in the United Kingdom where the family members are admitted alongside their children.  The Cavell Centre Fulbourn Hospital has a sister facility run by the same trust located on the Edith Cavell Healthcare Campus in Peterborough. The Cavell Centre is a purpose-built unit opened in 2009, comprising seven mental health wards servicing those living in the city of Peterborough and surrounding areas.

Cooktops are often found integrated with an oven into a kitchen stove but may also be standalone devices. Cooktops are commonly powered by gas or electricity, though oil or other fuels are sometimes used. Gas Gas cooktop flame Gas cooktops consist of one or more gas burners with arrangements to control the rate of flow. They often have integral lighters or (in older models) pilot lights, and may have safety interlocks designed to reduce the risk of hazardous gas leaks. Gas cooking has been associated with negative health effects, such as reduced pulmonary function and a higher rate of respiratory symptoms in children. Electric A coil-top electric range =Coil= Electric coil cooktops use electric heating elements that directly heat pots placed on them. They are inexpensive to buy and maintain, but are considered more difficult to clean than smooth-top models. =Ceramic= A ceramic hob with two multi-zone radiant heaters. A ceramic hob consists of a low-expansion thermal glass-ceramic that is transparent to infrared. This surface houses radiant or halogen heaters below it. The advantage of this arrangement is that the heat can be quickly controlled. =Induction= Top view of an induction cooktop Induction cooking involves the electrical heating of a cooking vessel by magnetic induction instead of by radiation or thermal conduction from an electrical heating element or from a flame. Because inductive heating directly heats the vessel, very rapid increases in temperature can be achieved and changes in heat settings are fast, similar to gas. Paper presented at the 2014 ACEEE Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings In an induction cooktop (\\"induction hob\\" or \\"induction stove\\"), a coil of copper wire is placed under the cooking pot, and an alternating electric current is passed through it. The resulting oscillating magnetic field induces a magnetic flux that repeatedly magnetises the pot, treating it like the lossy magnetic core of a transformer. This produces large eddy currents in the pot, which, because of the resistance of the pot, heat it. For nearly all models of induction cooktops, a cooking vessel must be made of, or contain, a ferromagnetic metal such as cast iron or some stainless steels. However, copper, glass, non-magnetic stainless steels, and aluminum vessels can be used if placed on a ferromagnetic disk that functions as a conventional hotplate. Induction cooking is quite efficient, which means it puts less waste heat into the kitchen, can be quickly turned off, and has safety advantages compared to gas stoves. Cooktops are also usually easy to clean, because the cooktop itself does not get very hot. Downdraft cooktops Downdraft gas cooktop Downdraft cooktops have an integrated ventilation system that pulls cooking fumes downwards. This can be useful when updraft (or overhead) ventilation is not possible, such as in open kitchen designs where an overhead ventilation hood is not desirable. However, updraft ventilation is considered more effective; downdraft systems may not be able to extract the fumes from taller pots. Placement =Installed= Cooktops are virtually ubiquitous in kitchens. They may be built into a stove along with an oven. Alternatively, cooktops are often installed independently in work surfaces. =Hot plate= An electric tabletop burner A hot plate is a portable self-contained tabletop small appliance cooktop that features one, two or more electric heating elements or gas burners. A hot plate can be used as a standalone appliance, but is often used as a substitute for one of the burners from an oven range or a kitchen stove. Hot plates are often used for food preparation, generally in locations where a full kitchen stove would not be convenient or practical. A hot plate can have a flat or round surface. Hot plates can be used for traveling or in areas without electricity.

Introduced in 1992 by Leonard Lewis, the character was incorporated gradually and brought back as a regular following a brief stint due to a popular reception. He is depicted as a lovable loser and a nerd. Bradley quit the role and Nigel was written out of the serial in April 1998 and was given a happy ending. The door was left open for a possible future return. Storylines Nigel attended school with Phil and Grant Mitchell (Steve McFadden and Ross Kemp) and starts frequenting the Mitchells' home town of Walford in 1992, before finally moving there himself following the death of his mother later that year. He lodges with Dot Cotton (June Brown) and is known in the community for his extravagant shirts and ties, and his mop of shaggy curly hair. Dot comes to think of Nigel as the son she never had because he is the complete opposite of her own son Nick (John Altman). This causes trouble between Nigel and Nick when Nick bullies Nigel, jealous of Dot's friendship with him. In 1993, he falls in love with Debbie Tyler (Nicola Duffett). Debbie is estranged from her abusive husband, Liam (Francis Magee); however, Liam returns in 1993 to reunite with Debbie and visit their young daughter Clare (Gemma Bissix). He reacts with fury when he realises Nigel is seeing Debbie and bullies both in an attempt to split them up. Eventually, Liam is frightened away by Grant. Nigel and Debbie marry in 1994 and are happy until 1995, when Debbie is killed in a hit and run accident. Nigel is devastated for some time. Liam returns and fights Nigel for custody of Clare but is unsuccessful because of his history of violent behaviour towards Debbie; Nigel legally adopts her. Following a long period of mourning, Nigel grows close to Lorraine Wicks (Jacqueline Leonard) and attempts to ignite a relationship. This goes awry as Lorraine does not return Nigel's romantic feelings and is instead attracted to Grant, which deeply hurts Nigel. In 1997, he meets Julie Haye (Karen Henthorn), Clare's school teacher, who occasionally dropped into Nigel's video shop to rent French films. Their friendship blossoms into romance but Nigel remains reticent believing he is tarnishing Debbie's honour. He almost loses Julie after she announces she is moving to Scotland, but on the night of her departure, Nigel sees sense and pledges his love for Julie and in April 1998, he and Clare leave Walford for Scotland to be with Julie and her son, Josh Saunders (Jon Lee). Dot occasionally visits Nigel off-screen. Clare returns to Walford in February 2008 to stay with Dot. Nigel is meant to visit her in July 2008, but does not arrive. This upsets Clare and she confides in Bradley Branning (Charlie Clements) that her and Nigel's relationship had become strained in her time away from Walford. According to Clare, Nigel had transferred his affections to Julie's son Josh as he struggled to cope with Clare's teenage dalliances. In October 2009, Pat reveals that Nigel had suffered a heart attack and Dot goes to visit him. Creation and development Nigel was one of several introductions occurring in 1992. Executive producer Leonard Lewis took a tentative approach to introducing new characters in 1992. Most were introduced gradually, making an initial appearance and then joining the programme full-time a couple of months later. This allowed the producers and writers to create new characters and see them brought to life by the actors before committing them to a longer contract. Characters introduced in this way included Mandy Salter (Nicola Stapleton), Christine Hewitt (Lizzie Power) and Nigel Bates, played by Paul Bradley. Nigel first appears in March 1992 as a friend of established characters Grant (Ross Kemp) and Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), when he comes to Walford and buys Frank Butcher's (Mike Reid) Mercedes. After a successful first appearance, Nigel moves to the soap's setting permanently later in the year following the death of his mother and became the lodger of Dot Cotton (June Brown). Paul Bradley has discussed his casting in Larry Jaffee's book, Albert Square & Me: The Actors of Eastenders, conducted in 1994: \\"I was only supposed to do three episodes and I think they just liked the character. Nigel is kind of light and funny and arrived just after Gill [Fowler] (Susanna Dawson) had died of AIDS and the show was accused of being a bit gloomy. I came back for one more episode and then I've been back ever since.\\" Bradley has described Nigel as \\"harmless and amiable ... I suppose he's a bit of a wallie. Nigel is very well-meaning. He was best mates at school with Phil and Grant. Where they would use their fists, he would use jokes to get out of trouble.\\" Author Kate Lock has described him as \\"a lovely, lovely man with two flaws: his inability to say 'no' to a fry-up and his faith in Grant Mitchell.\\" Lock suggested that Nigel and Grant were diametrically opposed personalities. Lock added, \\"Nigel was overweight, shy, had the world's worst taste in shirts and ties and sported a mop of shaggy curls reminiscent of 70s footballers, so it wasn't often he found success with the opposite sex, although women were drawn to his gentleness and humour more than he realised.\\" Author Rupert Smith classified Nigel as a \\"soft touch\\" character, the type of characters who were \\"permenently confused, sexually bungling men [...] These poor souls exist to be trampled, disappointed and taken for a ride by any crook or schemer that crosses their path.\\" In 1993, two characters central to Nigel's narrative are introduced: A love-interest Debbie Tyler (Nicola Duffett) and her daughter Clare (Gemma Bissix). Their introduction stems around a storyline focusing on spousal abuse, when it is revealed that Debbie is being abused by her estranged husband Liam Tyler (Francis Magee). Nigel and Debbie's eventual marriage is the focus of EastEnders' celebratory episode on 12 July 1994, which marked the show's 1000th episode. EastEnders' writer Colin Brake has selected it as 1994's episode of the year. Off-screen the show's Series Producer Barbara Emile decided to mark the 1000th episode with a celebration and the wedding of Nigel and Debbie was chosen as the event. It was scripted to be a happy occasion in the soap, with Debbie and Nigel's ceremony going ahead despite threats of intrusion from Liam. The Bateses happiness was short-lived on-screen, as in 1995, Debbie's actress Nicola Duffet requested to be written out of the soap; Debbie was killed off in the serial leaving Nigel a grieving widower, fighting for custody of his step daughter, Clare. In December 1996, it was announced that Bradley decided to quit EastEnders for fear of being typecast as a nerd and \\"lovable loser\\". He was the third senior cast member to quit in as space of two months, following the announced departures of Jacqueline Leonard and Paul Nicholls who played Lorraine and Joe Wicks. Bradley said, \\"I have made a decision about leaving EastEnders and I have told the BBC about it. I know it is regular work and you are in the public eye, but it is time to move on. Much as I love playing Nigel, I would not like people to think that was all I did. I did a lot of work before EastEnders and I will after. I don't want to be like some people who've been in [ITV soap opera] Coronation Street for 20 years - I'm much too restless.\\" A BBC insider commented, \\"It's a real blow that Paul wants to go, but we hope that he doesn't close the door altogether. It's very worrying that so much of the top talent is wanting out of Albert Square.\\" The character remains on-screen until April 1998 and was given a \\"happy ending\\", leaving to begin a new life with a newfound love Julie Haye (Karen Henthorn), allowing for a future return. Henthorn has suggested that because Nigel was \\"such a popular character\\", and because he had such an unsuccessful love life throughout the course of the show, the producers of EastEnders felt that the viewing public would not want him to have anything other than a \\"happy ending\\".

Robert John Welch (22 July 1859 – 28 September 1936) was an Irish photographer interested in natural history, particularly mollusca. Welch, born in Strabane, County Tyrone, and lived for a time in Enniskillen. He was the son of an accomplished Scottish amateur photographer. After the death of his father Welch established his own business in 1883 in Lonsdale Street in Belfast. Much of his time was spent taking pictures that reflected the life of the people and the contemporary landscape. Welch specialised in outdoors photography and took thousands of photographs of the towns and scenery of Ireland. He was a skilled craftsman and his studies of Ireland and Irish life in the late 19th and early 20th centuries are today justly famous. Welch also took many important photographs of national monuments, megaliths and dolmens, particularly of sites such as Carrowmore, Loughcrew, the Hill of Tara and Newgrange. Welch had an excellent sense of composition often got local people or landowners to stand in his photographs as models. The Titanic sails through Belfast Lough by Robert Welch. The National Museum of Northern Ireland has a collection of over 4,000 photographs by Welch covering a fifty year span, in addition to his diaries and maps. A permanent exhibition at the Ulster Museum features twenty enlarged photographs of his works on the subject of travel and transport. Welch was a member of the Royal Irish Academy as well as serving as president of both the Belfast Naturalists' Field Club and the Conchological Society of Great Britain & Ireland. In 1923 to recognise his work Queen's University Belfast awarded him an honorary Master of Science degree. He was hired by the shipyard Harland and Wolff to take photographs of the constructions of R.M.S. Olympic and R.M.S. Titanic. William Alfred Green, another noted Belfast photographer was an apprentice of Welch, and photographed many of the same subjects and sites as his mentor.

The Treaty of Wallingford, also known as the Treaty of Winchester or the Treaty of Westminster, was an agreement reached in England in the summer of 1153. It effectively ended a civil war known as the Anarchy (1135–54), caused by a dispute between Empress Matilda and her cousin Stephen of Blois over the English crown. The Treaty of Wallingford allowed Stephen to keep the throne until his death (which was to come in October 1154), but ensured that he would be succeeded by Matilda's son, Henry II. Prelude to the treaty In 1153, the civil war had dragged on for nearly 15 years of armed combat, in which neither side could achieve victory. This long period was characterised by a breakdown in law and order and allowed rebel barons to acquire ever greater power in northern England and in East Anglia, with widespread devastation in the regions of major fighting. By the early 1150s the barons and the Church mostly wanted a long-term peace. King Stephen, however, targeted Matilda's supporter Brien FitzCount at Wallingford Castle by building countercastles near Wallingford. Henry launched attacks on those countercastles, and a battle between the forces was expected. However William d'Aubigny, 1st Earl of Arundel successfully argued the futility of further fighting. A temporary truce was reached at Wallingford on the banks of the Thames, but Stephen's son Eustace opposed settling. However, after Eustace's sudden death in August 1153, it appears that a more formal agreement was written at Winchester in November 1153, signed later at Westminster. Fighting continued after Wallingford, but in a rather half-hearted fashion. Stephen lost the towns of Oxford and Stamford to Henry while the king was diverted fighting Hugh Bigod in the east of England, but Nottingham Castle survived an Angevin attempt to capture it.Bradbury, p. 184. Meanwhile, Stephen's brother Henry of Blois and Archbishop Theobald of Canterbury were for once unified in an effort to broker a permanent peace between the two sides, putting pressure on Stephen to accept a deal.King (2010), pp. 279–280; Bradbury, p. 187. Stephen and Henry FitzEmpress's armies met again at Winchester, where the two leaders would ratify the terms of a permanent peace in November.King (2010), p. 280. Terms of the treaty Stephen announced the Treaty of Winchester in Winchester Cathedral: he recognised Henry FitzEmpress as his adopted son and successor, in return for Henry doing homage to him. Other conditions included: *Stephen promised to listen to Henry's advice, but retained all his royal powers; *Stephen's remaining son, William, would do homage to Henry and renounce his claim to the throne, in exchange for promises of the security of his lands; *Key royal castles would be held on Henry's behalf by guarantors, whilst Stephen would have access to Henry's castles; *The numerous foreign mercenaries would be demobilised and sent home.King (2010), pp. 280–283; Bradbury pp. 189–190; Barlow, pp. 187–188. Stephen and Henry sealed the treaty with a kiss of peace in the cathedral.King (2010), p. 281. Henry II later rewarded Wallingford for its assistance in the struggle by giving the town its royal charter in 1155. See also *List of treaties References Sources * Bradbury, Jim.

It is responsible for the movement of the gluteus maximus in activities requiring the hip to extend the thigh, such as climbing stairs. Injury to this nerve is rare but often occurs as a complication of posterior approach to the hip during hip replacement. When damaged, one would develop gluteus maximus lurch, which is a gait abnormality which causes the individual to 'lurch' backwards to compensate lack in hip extension. Anatomy The largest muscle of the posterior hip, gluteus maximus, is innervated by the inferior gluteal nerve.Skalak, A.

It branches out and then enters the deep surface of the gluteus maximus, the principal extensor of the thigh, and supplies it. =Origin= The muscle is supplied by the inferior gluteal nerve which arises from the dorsal branches of the ventral rami of the fifth (L5), the first (S1) and second (S2) sacral nerves.Ling, Z. X., and V. P. Kumar. \\"The Course of the Inferior Gluteal Nerve in the Posterior Approach to the Hip.\\" Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery-British Volume 88B.12 (2006): 1580-83. Print. The lumbosacral trunk, which is made up of L5 and a small branch of L4, effectively connects the lumbar and sacral plexuses.Petchprapa, C. N., et al. \\"Mr Imaging of Entrapment Neuropathies of the Lower Extremity Part 1. The Pelvis and Hip.\\" Radiographics 30.4 (2010): 983-1000. Print. The lower branches of the L4 and the L5 nerves enter the sacral plexus. The sacral plexus is formed by the lumbosacral trunk, the first to third sacral ventral rami, and part of the fourth, the remainder of the last joining the coccygeal plexus. The sacral plexus is formed in the pelvis in front of the piriformis muscle. The sacral plexus is formed anterior to the piriformis muscle and gives rise to the sciatic nerve, the superior and inferior gluteal nerves, and the pudendal and posterior femoral cutaneous nerves. However, most of the sacral plexus nerves are scarcely recognizable, because they leave the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen. From the pelvis, the anterior primary branches of the nerves entering the plexus (the first sacral nerve being a particularly large one) and a mass of nerves on the piriformis can be recognized.Mirilas, P., and J. E. Skandalakis. \\"Surgical Anatomy of the Retroperitoneal Spaces, Part Iv: Retroperitoneal Nerves.\\" American Surgeon 76.3 (2010): 253-62. Print. =Course= The inferior gluteal nerve leaves the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen and runs underneath the piriformis muscle. It then divides into muscular branches to supply the gluteus maximus that pass posteriorly into the deep surface of the gluteus maximus muscle.Apaydin, N., et al. \\"The Course of the Inferior Gluteal Nerve and Surgical Landmarks for Its Localization During Posterior Approaches to Hip.\\" Surgical and Radiologic Anatomy 31.6 (2009): 415-18. Print. The inferior gluteal nerve is superficial to the sciatic nerve. It has been described as having multiple branches with subsequent innervation of the overlying gluteus maximus. The inferior gluteal nerve entered the deep surface of gluteus maximus very inferiorly. At the lower border of the piriformis muscle, the nerve turns backward and divides into upward and downward diverging branches, which enter the gluteus maximus. The nerve may also send a branch to the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve. The inferior gluteal nerve reliably emerged inferior to the piriformis muscle. The branching characteristics of the nerve falls into two broad categories.One category is short stalks which came under the piriformis and then gave rise to all of the terminal branches of the nerve which spanned the muscle of the gluteus maximus. The number of branches from the stalk ranged from four to six. The second category occurs as a partial split of the stalk that occurred proximal to the coverage of the piriformis. There were two to three divisions of the inferior gluteal nerve under the piriformis that would further divide close to the insertion of the nerve into the actual muscle belly. The nerve was always seen close to and medial to the sciatic nerve when it left the sacral plexus inferior to the piriformis. In all specimens, the nerve entered the deep surface of gluteus maximus approximately 5 cm from the tip of the greater trochanter of the femur and entered the deep surface of gluteus maximus over the inferior one-third of the muscle belly. The inferior gluteal nerve is accompanied by the inferior gluteal artery, a branch of the anterior trunk of the internal iliac artery. However the relationship between the inferior gluteal nerve and artery was found to be unpredictable. No consistent relationship between the inferior gluteal artery and the inferior gluteal nerve was observed in current studies. There is a relationship between the common stalk of the inferior gluteal nerve and external anatomic landmarks. The targeted region should be aimed inferior to the most prominent aspect of the greater trochanter, and medial to the landmark of the ischial tuberosity, at the depth of the posterior border of the proximal femur. Triangulating using these three coordinates, one can reliably reach the source of the inferior gluteal nerve. This will result in maximal stimulation of the gluteus maximus musculature when using electrical stimulation for the purpose of prevention of pressure ulcers. The sciatic nerve (L4 to S3), the largest nerve of the body, immediately leaves the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen, below the piriformis. The superior gluteal nerve passes backward through the greater sciatic foramen, above the piriformis: the inferior gluteal nerve also passes backward through the greater sciatic foramen but below the piriformis.\\" Function The major function of the gluteus maximus is to extend the flexed thigh and bring it inline with the trunk. It may prevent the forward momentum of the trunk from producing flexion at the supporting hip during bipedal gait. It is intermittently active in the walking cycle and in climbing stairs and continuously active in strong lateral rotation and abduction of the thigh and also stabilizes the femur on the tibia when the knee extensors are relaxed. In addition to this, the gluteus maximus has an important role during some activities like running or standing up. The gluteus maximus, a large muscle with numerous attachments, is a powerful extensor of the thigh or of the trunk lower limbs are in a fixed position. The gluteus maximus is also a strong hip stabilzer. It extends thigh at the hip, assists in laterally rotating the thigh. It contracts at heel-strike, slowing forward motion of trunk by arresting flexion of the hip and initiating extension. This movement prevents trunk from falling forward. Surprisingly, however, the gluteus maximus is not important posturally, is relaxed when one is standing, and is little used in walking. It is employed in running, climbing, and rising from a sitting or stooped position. It also controls flexion at the hip upon sitting down. Injury =From hip replacement= Inferior gluteal entrapment neuropathy is rarely reported but is recognized as a complication of the posterior approach to hip arthroplasty. Injuries to the peripheral nerves occur in 0.5% to 8% of patients undergoing total hip replacement. The posterior approach has been assessed most widely and is perhaps the most frequently used, but it is also the one most likely to be associated with damage to the inferior gluteal nerve since this structure is not usually seen. Direct abnormalities of the nerve may be difficult to detect due to the small size of the nerve, although signal intensity alterations in the gluteus maximus may be encountered Diagnostic imaging of peripheral nerves about the hip is a challenging task due to the complex regional anatomy, the small size and intricate course of many nerves. There are also a variety of clinical situations leading to local disturbances in the nerve function the positioning of the inferior gluteal nerve makes it vulnerable to iagtrogenic injury during posterior and posterior approaches to the hipTagliafico Alberto, et al. \\"Imaging Of Neuropathies About The Hip.\\" European Journal of Radiology (n.d.): ScienceDirect. Web. 16 Nov. 2012 It is subject to injury by compression and ischemia in sedentary individuals, resulting in difficulty in rising from a sitting position and difficulty climbing stairs.Dejong, P. J., and T. W. Vanweerden. \\"Inferior and Superior Gluteal Nerve Paresis and Femur Neck Fracture after Spondylolisthesis and Lysis - a Case-Report.\\" Journal of Neurology 230.4 (1983): 267-70. Print. The incidence of damage to the inferior gluteal nerve after replacement of the hip is still uncertain. Peripheral nerve injury may occur during operations on the hip as a result of operative trauma associated with stretching and retraction of the nerve. Few studies have focused on damage to the inferior gluteal nerve during hip replacement. In ten other patients who had a posterior approach, nine had abnormal electromyographic findings in inferior gluteal innervated muscles and eight of the ten also had abnormalities in superior gluteal innervated muscles. They suggested that abnormalities of gait after the operation may be due to injury to these nerves. The reduction in walking speed and persistently abnormal gait, sometimes seen in patients one year after total hip replacement, were associated with a decrease in the extensor moment with a resultant decrease in the range of extension of the hip and a reduction in the abductor moment.Mondelli, M., et al. \\"Mononeuropathies of Inferior and Superior Gluteal Nerves Due to Hypertrophy of Piriformis Muscle in a Basketball Player.\\" Muscle & Nerve 38.6 (2008): 1660-62. Print. When a muscle-splitting incision is made across gluteus maximus as part of the classical posterior approach and the muscle parted by hand-held or self- retaining retractors, the likelihood of damage to the inferior gluteal nerve is high. The nerve enters the deep surface of the muscle and is not easily visualised and differentiated from other structures running with it, such as the blood vessels. Parting the muscle damages the nerve further by stretching or even rupturing its branches which run superiorly on its deep surface. Entrapment neuropathy is an underrecognized cause of pain and functional impairment caused by acute or chronic injury to peripheral nerves. Although nerves may be injured anywhere along their course, they are more prone to compression, entrapment, or stretching as they traverse anatomically vulnerable regions, such as superficial or geographically constrained spaces. Subclinical electromyographic abnormalities of both the superior and inferior gluteal nerves have been described in up to 77% of patients after total hip replacement, regardless of the surgical approach. The posterior approach is the most common and practical of those used to expose the hip joint. The posterior approaches allow excellent visualization of the femoral shaft, thus are popular for revision joint replacement surgery in cases in which the femoral component needs to be replaced. The likelihood of damage to the inferior gluteal nerve is reported to be high when a muscle-splitting incision is made across the gluteus maximus as a part of the classical posterior approach to the hip. This may cause selective denervation of the gluteus maximus since the inferior gluteal nerve courses along the deep surface of the muscle and is not easily visualized and differentiated from other structures running with it, such as blood vessels. =Gluteus maximus lurch= Injury to this nerve leads to a gluteus maximus lurch. When gluteus maximus is weak/injured, trunk extends (lean back) on heel-strike on weakened side. This compensates for weakness of hip extension. Damage to the inferior gluteal nerve causes loss of extension at hip, and causes the buttock to waste. The normal gluteus maximus gait is when the gluteus maxims begins to contract at moment of heel-strike, slowing forward motion of trunk by arresting flexion of hip and initiating extension. When gluteus maximus is weak, trunk lurches backward (gluteus maximus lurch) at heel-strike on weakened side to interrupt forward motion of the trunk. There is great difficulty in preventing the flexion of the trunk heel strike so the person may use trunk extension before heel strike to maintain balance causing a backwards lurch. The trunk lurches back on the stance phase side hyperextending. The backwards trunk lurch persists throughout the stance to maintain the gravitational force line behind the hip axis locking the hip into extension. There is an apparent forward protrusion of the affected hip due to exaggerated hip motion and the person may also hold the shoulders backward to keep the center of gravity behind the joint. The hamstring muscles often compensate for the gluteus maximus weakness resulting in a near normal gait pattern but most often these muscles are affected together.

Weakness or paralysis of these muscles caused by a damaged superior gluteal nerve can result in a weak abduction in the affected hip joint. This gait disturbance is known as Trendelenburg gait. In a positive Trendelenburg's sign the pelvis sags toward the normal unsupported side (the swing leg). The opposite, when the pelvis is elevated on the swing side, is known as Duchenne limp.

The word asemic means \\"having no specific semantic content\\", or \\"without the smallest unit of meaning\\".From Greek: asemos (αόεμoβ) = without sign, unmarked, obscure, or ignoble. With the non-specificity of asemic writing there comes a vacuum of meaning, which is left for the reader to fill in and interpret. All of this is similar to the way one would deduce meaning from an abstract work of art. Where asemic writing distinguishes itself among traditions of abstract art is in the asemic author's use of gestural constraint, and the retention of physical characteristics of writing such as lines and symbols. Asemic writing is a hybrid art form that fuses text and image into a unity, and then sets it free to arbitrary subjective interpretations. It may be compared to free writing or writing for its own sake, instead of writing to produce verbal context. The open nature of asemic works allows for meaning to occur across linguistic understanding; an asemic text may be \\"read\\" in a similar fashion regardless of the reader's natural language. Multiple meanings for the same symbolism are another possibility for an asemic work, that is, asemic writing can be polysemantic or have zero meaning, infinite meanings, or its meaning can evolve over time. Asemic works leave for the reader to decide how to translate and explore an asemic text; in this sense, the reader becomes co-creator of the asemic work. In 1997 visual poets Tim Gaze and Jim Leftwich first applied the word asemic to name their quasi-calligraphic writing gestures. They then began to distribute them to poetry magazines both online and in print. The authors explored sub-verbal and sub-letteral forms of writing, and textual asemia as a creative option and as an intentional practice. Since the late 1990s, asemic writing has blossomed into a worldwide literary/art movement. It has especially grown in the early part of the 21st century, though there is an acknowledgement of a long and complex history, which precedes the activities of the current asemic movement, especially with regards to abstract calligraphy, wordless writing, and verbal writing damaged beyond the point of legibility. Jim Leftwich has recently stated that an asemic condition of an asemic work is an impossible goal, and that it is not possible to create an art/literary work entirely without meaning. He has begun to use the term \\"pansemic\\" to describe this type of work. Others such as author Travis Jeppesen have found the term asemic to be problematic because \\"it seems to infer writing with no meaning.\\" Styles of asemic writing Asemic writing exists in many different forms. It is often created with a pen or brush, but can range from being hand drawn in the sand with a stick and documented by photography, or to works on canvas, paper, computer images, and animations. The key to asemic writing is that even though it is traditionally \\"unreadable\\" it still maintains a strong attractive appeal to the reader's eye. Various asemic writing includes pictograms, or ideograms the meanings of which are sometimes suggested by their shapes, though it may also flow as an abstract expressionist scribble which resembles writing but avoids words. Asemic writing, at times, exists as a conception or shadow of conventional writing practices. Reflecting writing, but not completely existing as a traditional writing system, asemic writing seeks to make the reader hover in a state between reading and looking. Asemic writing has no verbal sense, though it may have clear textual sense. Through its formatting and structure, asemic writing may suggest a type of document and, thereby, suggest a meaning. The form of art is still writing, often calligraphic in form, and either depends on a reader's sense and knowledge of writing systems for it to make sense, or can be understood through aesthetic intuition. True asemic writing occurs when the creator of the asemic piece cannot read their own asemic writing. Relative asemic writing is a natural writing system that can be read by some people but not by everyone (e.g. ciphers, wildstyle, etc.). Most asemic writing lies between these two extremes. Influences on asemic writing are illegible, invented, or primal scripts (cave paintings, doodles, children's drawings, etc.). But instead of being thought of as mimicry of preliterate expression, asemic writing may be considered to be a global postliterate style of writing that uses all forms of creativity for inspiration. Other influences on asemic writing are alien languages in science fiction, artistic languages, sigils (magick), undeciphered scripts, and graffiti. Uses for asemic writing include mental and creative idea stimulation, non-verbal communication, meditation, hoaxes, and general authorial self-expression. =History= Newsletter from Mirtha Dermisachedermisache-9 Newsletters & 1 Reportaje 2000: Newsletter, 2000 from Mirtha Dermisache, Nueve Newsletters & Un Reportaje, Buenos Aires : El borde, Marseille : Mobil-Home, Montpellier : Manglar, 2004. Offset printing, 440 copies. Asemic writing occurs in avant-garde literature and art with strong roots in the earliest forms of writing. The history of today's asemic movement stems from two Chinese calligraphers: \\"crazy\\" Zhang Xu, a Tang Dynasty (circa 800 CE) calligrapher who was famous for creating wild illegible calligraphy, and the younger \\"drunk\\" monk Huaisu who also excelled at illegible cursive calligraphy. Japanese calligraphers subsequently expanded upon Chinese abstract calligraphic expression by Hitsuzendō (the way of Zen through brush), allowing their works to move past formal presentation and \\"breathe with the vitality of eternal experience\\". In the 1920s Man Ray, who was influenced by Dada, created an early work of wordless writing with his poem Paris, 1924, which is nothing more than dashes on a page. Later in the 1920s, Henri Michaux, who was influenced by Asian calligraphy, Surrealism, and Automatic writing, began to create wordless works such as Alphabet (1925) and Narration (1927). Michaux referred to his calligraphic works as \\"interior Gestures\\". The writer and artist Wassily Kandinsky was an early precursor to asemic writing, with his linear piece Indian Story (1931) exemplifying complete textual abstraction. In the 1950s there is Brion Gysin (whose calligraphy was influenced by Japanese and Arabic calligraphy), Isidore Isou (who founded Lettrisme/Letterism), Cy Twombly (a former US Army Cryptologist), and Morita Shiryū/Bokujin-kai Group (Ink Human Society) all of whom expanded writing into illegible, abstract, and wordless visual mark-making; they would help lay the foundation for asemic writers of the future. Mira Schendel was an artist from Brazil who created many illegible works over the course of her life, for example her piece Archaic Writing (1964). Mirtha Dermisache is another writer who had created asemic writing since the 1960s. Dermisache actively said that even though her graphisms have no meaning, they still retained the full rights of an autonomous work. 1971 was the year when Alain Satié released his work which contains asemic writing throughout the entire graphic novel.Alain Satie, Écrit en Prose, Éditions PSI, 1971. León Ferrari was another artist/poet who created many asemic works in the 1960s and 1970s, such as Escritura (1976). 1974 saw the release of Max Ernst's work Maximiliana: The Illegal Practice Of Astronomy: hommage à Dorothea Tanning; this book is a major influence on asemic writers such as Tim Gaze, Michael Jacobson, and Derek Beaulieu. Roland Barthes was also involved with asemic writing; he titled his asemic works Contre-écritures. A modern example of asemic writing is Luigi Serafini's Codex Seraphinianus (1981). Serafini described the script of the Codex as asemic in a talk at the Oxford University Society of Bibliophiles held on May 8, 2009. In the 1980s, Chinese artist Xu Bing created Tiānshū, or A Book from the Sky which is a work of books and hanging scrolls on which were printed 4000 hand carved meaningless characters. The 1980s also saw artist Gu Wenda begin the first of a series of projects centered on the invention of meaningless, false Chinese ideograms, depicted as if they were truly old and traditional. One exhibition of this type was held in Xi'an in 1986, featuring paintings of fake ideograms on a massive scale. Also in China, during the 1990s, an abstract calligraphy movement known as \\"Calligraphy-ism\\" came into existence, a leading proponent of this movement being Luo Qi. Calligraphy-ism is an aesthetic movement that aims to develop calligraphy into an abstract art. The characters do not need to retain their traditional forms or be legible as words. In Vietnam during the 2000s, a calligraphy group called the Zenei Gang of Five appeared. To this group of young artists, “Wordless” means that which cannot be said, that which is both before and beyond the specificity of naming. To be without words is saying nothing and saying everything. Satu Kaikkonen, a contemporary asemic artist/writer from Finland, had this to say about asemic writing: Bruce Sterling comments about asemic writing on his Wired magazine blog Beyond the Beyond: False writing systems False writing systems are artificially constructed alphabets or scripts used (sometimes within the context of a false document) to convey a degree of verisimilitude. Examples of this include alien dialogue in comic strips, animated cartoons, and graphic novels (such as Alan Moore's The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, and the Valérian and Laureline series). The script in Luigi Serafini's 1981 Codex Seraphinianus was confirmed by the author to have no occult meaning. The Voynich manuscript, a mysterious work on which the Codex Seraphinianus was likely based, uses an undeciphered writing system which some have speculated to be false.

He was the leader of the Chechen-Ingush ASSR and later an ambassador of Russian Federation to the republic of Slovenia. Communist leader In 1989, Zavgayev, a former collective farm manager and senior Soviet Communist Party official, was elected as the first Chechen First Secretary of the Chechen- Ingush ASSR since the Chechens' return in 1957. In August 1991 Zavgayev, then communist leader of the Chechen-Ingush ASSR, was accused of support for the failed Moscow putsch against Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. Taking advantage of the Soviet Union's collapse, Dzhokhar Dudayev and his militants acted against the legitimate government and Zavgayev's administration. On September 6, 1991, militants of the All-National Congress of Chechen People (NCChP), who mainly consisted of freed inmates from Chechen jails, headed by Dudayev, stormed a session of the Chechen-Ingush ASSR Supreme Soviet, killing the Soviet Communist Party chief for Grozny, Vitali Kutsenko, severely injuring several other Soviet members, and effectively overthrowing the legitimate government of the Chechen-Ingush ASSR. Zavgayev, the Chairman of the Soviet, was not present. Trying to avoid further bloodshed he was compelled to leave the republic, publicly announcing that he would return. Chechen war By the spring of 1994 the atrocities and lawlessness in Chechnya have reached its toll. Both the president of Russia, Boris Yeltsin and the heads of the \\"force ministries\\" were convinced that Russia should actively intervene in Chechnya. Zavgayev was appointed a pro-Moscow head of state on 24 of October 1995, and was elected in December the same year with 96% of the votes. On December 8, 1995, Zavgayev and Viktor Chernomyrdin signed an agreement as a basis for a Russian-Chechen federation treaty which would give Chechnya broad autonomy along the lines of the between Russia and Tatarstan.

G. Wodehouse, first published in the United Kingdom on 4 October 1940 by Herbert Jenkins, London and in the United States on December 27, 1940 by Doubleday, Doran, New York.McIlvaine (1990), pp. 78–79, A63. In the novel, businessman James Duff wants to obtain a portrait that is in a country house. He makes a deal with young Lord Holbeton and Holbeton's fiancée Sally Fairmile to get them to steal the painting. Joss Weatherby, an advertising artist at Duff's company, falls in love with Sally and soon becomes involved in Duff's plotting.  Plot  Mrs and Mr Steptoe, from Los Angeles, live in Claines Hall, near Loose Chippings, Sussex. Over the fireplace hangs a portrait by artist Jocelyn \\"Joss\\" Weatherby of Mrs Beatrice Chavender, widow of Mrs Steptoe's brother, with a haughty expression. The rich, socially ambitious Mrs Steptoe, who gives her poor relation Sally tasks to earn her keep, tells Sally to go to London to find a valet who can make her reluctant husband dress respectably for high society. Mrs Chavendar finds the breakfast ham uneatable. Since it is a Paramount Ham, a product sold by Duff and Trotter, she decides to complain to her former fiancé James Duff, managing director of the firm, because he used to bore her about ham. George, second Baron Holbeton, worries this will upset Duff. Duff is the trustee of his inheritance (since George's father was Duff's business partner) and George wants the money. George's fiancée Sally volunteers to talk to Duff. Joss Weatherby, advertising artist for Duff and Trotter, sees Mrs Chavendar at Duff's office. Duff has stepped out to avoid her. Mrs Chavender thinks Duff has become a grouch because he is not married and asks if Joss is married. Joss has not married but is eager to marry someday, and tells Mrs Chavender that she will see quick service as soon as the right girl comes along. Later, Duff thinks of using Joss's portrait of Mrs Chavender for a Paramount Ham advertising poster (with her looking at a non-Paramount ham with haughty disapproval), but Mrs Steptoe refuses to sell the painting for fear of offending Mrs Chavender, since she might someday inherit Mrs Chavender's wealth. Duff fires Joss for eating company fruit. Sally appears, and Joss quickly falls in love with her. She needs a valet, and Joss takes the job to be near her. Duff makes a deal with Sally that George can get his money if he steals the portrait, claiming he wants the painting because he still loves Mrs Chavender. At Claines Hall, Joss befriends the butler Chibnall and blackmails Mr Steptoe, who tried to win money off the cook in a game of craps, into dressing correctly for high society. He gives Mr Steptoe advice on playing craps, and Steptoe confides in Joss that he wants to be an actor in Hollywood but lacks money for transportation. Duff doubts George will steal the painting and offers to buy it from Mr Steptoe, who recruits Joss to steal it. George tries to steal it but fails. Joss also makes a failed attempt, and Chibnall, influenced by his fiancée Vera who reads crime novels, is now suspicious of Joss. Mrs Chavender tells Joss she wants a share of Duff's payment for the painting, since she actually lost her money in a stock crash. She has kept this secret from Mrs Steptoe, who is not generous with her poor relations. She also informs Joss about Sally's engagement to George. Duff tells Sally about Joss's feelings for her. Both Joss and Sally hope to steal the painting during Mrs Steptoe's garden party, but the party is ruined by rain. Mr Steptoe has lost badly at craps and needs money, so Joss takes a chance and steals the painting. He also tells Sally he wants to marry her and impulsively kisses her. George sees this and ends their engagement, since he no longer wants to marry her anyway. Joss apologizes, but Sally reveals she wants to marry Joss. Mrs Steptoe finds Joss smoking in her room and fires him. Duff changes his mind about George and gives him his money, and inadvertently proposes to Mrs Chavender, who accepts, having heard he still loves her. Joss and Duff plan to retrieve the painting from Joss's room; Vera eavesdrops and warns Chibnall. Chibnall finds the painting, apprehends Joss and Duff, and brings Joss to Mrs Steptoe. Joss tries to take the blame for stealing the painting, and so does Mrs Chavender, who admits she needs the money. Mr Steptoe, impressed with Joss for not revealing his involvement, becomes more assertive and defends Joss. He declares he will sell Duff the painting and convinces Mrs Steptoe to come with him to Hollywood where there is less rain. At Mrs Chavender's insistence, Duff rehires and promotes Joss, and bribes Chibnall to keep quiet about Duff's misadventures, allowing Chibnall and Vera to buy a pub. Duff is uncertain about marrying Mrs Chavender, until he realises they are soulmates when she suggests using her portrait in a ham advertisement.

According to the Heimskringla, there was something resembling a town there several centuries earlier — the first known town in North Norway, known as \\"Vågar\\". There are several attractions in Kabelvåg: the Lofoten Museum, Lofoten Aquarium, and Espolin Gallery. Vågan Church (also known as the Lofoten Cathedral) is located in Kabelvåg. The European route E10 highway runs through the village.

There are only sparse traces of settlements in the area now known as Kabelvåg during the Iron Age. A coupleHer lå Norges viktigste by of kilometers west of the present-day center of Kabelvåg, Vágar existed as a city between 1000 and 1400. It was Northern Norway's first city. During the Middle Ages the settlement known as Vågan experienced a rise in importance. This happens mostly because of the seasonal fishing, \\"Lofotfisket\\", which mostly takes part in an area of the sea known as Hølla, located between modern day Kabelvåg, Svolvær, and Skrova.  Lofotfiske  The Lofoten is the spawning grounds for the northern Atlantic cod. When spawning season begins, it creates an extreme increase in the activity of the fishing industry. A result of the \\"Lofotfiske\\" event, a great need for storage arises, as the fish is processed and cured in large amounts. This led to the drying and salting of fish. Due to the special weather of the Lofoten islands, it is an ideal place to make the product known as tørrfisk (). During the Middle Ages, dried fish became a very important commodity in the Catholic countries of Southern Europe, and the backbone of the local economy. According to historians, dried cod from Nordland in the 13th century accounted for 80 percent of all of Norway's exports.

The surviving members of El Ciento combined various scientific, arcane and alchemical methods of life extension in order to render themselves immortal. At a later point in time, they were driven out of Aragon by the Spanish Inquisition, but by then they had granted themselves vastly extended lifespans. They later discovered that the only way they could stay alive was to own the land they lived on and to feed off the despair and negative emotions of the human tenants on their lands; they also learned how to become immaterial and possess human bodies. Though most members of El Ciento feed off human suffering, some few have been able to survive by feeding on positive emotions. The immortal known as Ra's al Ghul considers El Ciento to be a threat to his plans.As seen in Black Lightning: Year One #4 (April 2009). DC Comics. A member of El Ciento later established himself in Metropolis's Southside, an area which would later be known as Suicide Slum. The 100 held a firm grip on the city's criminal underworld for years, indulging in crimes such as drug trafficking and racketeering. They later seem to have spread across the country with branches operating in other cities. They have also made enemies of many heroes, including Rose and Thorn (whose father they murdered), Halo (whom they murdered as well as her parents), and Superman himself.

He returned to Northern Ireland to play for Ards, Glenavon, and Portadown. He finished his playing career with Crusaders. Walker is also a Born-again Christian. Managerial career =Crusaders F.C.= He later became player-manager of Crusaders, in 1989. Walker was a player with Crusaders and was appointed manager in 1989. Walker brought huge success to the North Belfast club by winning the Irish League in 1995 and 1997, also winning the Gold Cup in 1996, the Ulster Cup in 1994, the County Antrim Shield in 1992, and the Stena Line Trophy in 1997, the same year he won the league. Walker had a very good number of players who would become Crusaders legends. Kirk Hunter was a fan favourite along with future manager of Crusaders Stephen Baxter. Other players included Sid Burrows, Glenn Dunlop, Kevin McKeown, Glenn Hunter, and future Glentoran pair Darren Lockhart and Chris Morgan. Walker stunned not only Crusaders fans but the whole Irish League by resigning from the club in 1998. He later became manager of Glenavon. =Glenavon F.C.= Walker became manager of the Lurgan Blues hoping to bring success as he did with Crusaders. He did bring a little success to Glenavon by winning the local Mid-Ulster Cup in 1999. Walker resigned in 2000. After leaving Glenavon on 31 July 2000Walker quits Glenavon post he became a pundit for BBC Radio Ulster. =Glentoran= After becoming a co-commentator for Northern Ireland's local radio show BBC Radio Ulster for Sportsound (the football show to cover all games and bring the final scores) Walker showed a huge interest in becoming new Glentoran manager after the sacking of Paul Miller. In May 2007 Millar was sacked as manager of Glentoran, and Walker finally realised his dream of being appointed Glens manager on 24 May.Walker takes over as Glens boss However, Walker had informed the Glentoran board before his appointment that he did not have the relevant UEFA \\"A\\" coaching badge to compete in Europe, the board informed him that this was not an issue and he was therefore Glentoran manager. Less than 48 hours later, it appeared that this was a problem for Glentoran and Walker was informed by then Glentoran Director For Football Tom Dick, that Alan McDonald (at the time Glentoran 1st team Coach) had been appointed caretaker manager.Walker unable to take Glens job Roy Walker was not fired as Glentoran manager, and the resulting days became a media circus at the club, with some directors resigning. On 29 May, Alan McDonald was appointed Glentoran manager. Roy Walker then issued a statement in the Belfast Telegraph, informing the fans of the entire situation, and revealing that he believed he was still Glentoran manager. He also revealed that he had been offered a place on the Glentoran board,Walker offered Glens board role but McDonald refused to be part of the club if Walker assumed that position. No board member issued a statement at that time, leaving many Glentoran fans unsure of the situation. The board later released a statement saying that Walker was considering a place on the Glentoran board.Dick wants Reynolds to step down =Ballymena United= After failing for the Uefa badges as Glentoran, Walker was appointed new manager of Ballymena United. Walker has come close to a few cup finals but losing in the quarter finals and knock out stages. Walker is currently still with the club. On 20 May 2008, Walker was announced as the new manager of Ballymena United, following another convoluted managerial situation. After the resignation of previous manager Tommy Wright, Ballymena had initially announced Wright's assistant Jim Grattan as his successor until the appointment was vetoed by Grattan's full-time employers, the Irish Football Association. Walker didn't win any trophies with the Sky Blues but brought the best out of players who didn't really get opportunities at former clubs, Gary McCutcheon and Gavin Taggart were two of those players who soon became key players at the club. Allan Jenkins, Dwayne Nelson and Wayne Drummond were also players who became key players. In the 2011/12 season, Walker resigned as manager after the Sky Blues lost to his former club Crusaders in the Irish League Cup semi-final on 13 December 2011. After Ballymena United Walker is currently among the possible contenders to be new manager of East Belfast giants Glentoran. Walker applied for the job on 1 February 2012. Walker lost to former Cliftonville manager Eddie Patterson.

He was born in Vodňany (hence his surname), in southern Bohemia. He studied at the University of Prague and in 1596 and was made Master of Liberal Arts there. He became a teacher in Prague and Kutná Hora. From 1603 he taught Greek and Latin at the University of Prague. He also taught history and Latin poetry. He was repeatedly appointed as dean, prorector, and rector of this university. Campanus was a Hussite before renouncing this faith and becoming a Catholic in 1622.  Works  Campanus usually wrote his works in Latin, but also wrote occasionally in Czech, Greek, and German. Some of his works, like the play Břetislav und Jitka (Bretislaus) (1614), were forbidden, because they were critical of the dukes of Bohemia. His works were recognized in Europe for their metrical perfection. Campanus' first collection of musical works, Sacrarum odarum libri duo, was published in Frankfurt in 1613. The Sacrarum odarum, which includes Rorando coeli, contains primarily short vocal works set in a simple, homorhythmic style. *Turcicorum tyrannorum qui inde usque ab Otomanno rebus Turcicis praefuerunt, descriptio (1597) *Heilige Oden/Posvátné ódy (Umdichtung der Psalmen Davids/Přebásnění Davidových žalmů) *Cechias (a history of Bohemia in verse form) *Bretislaus (play) *Elegie der Angst (Elegie o strachu) *Bitte um Frieden (Prosba o mír) His chants include: *Ad Jehovam *Ad puelli Jesuki cunas *Rorando coeli: Rorando coeli has two choirs. They imitate one another throughout. The double choir technique utilized in this motet evokes the more complex antiphonal works of Campanus' contemporaries in Venice.  Poems  *Tristitia (In lectulo quaero meo) *Surge iam linquens (Surge iam linquens thalamum tepentem) These were published in 1612, and can be found in the Cantica canticorum in Odaria, LIII, od. 17.

In 1899-1900, the French organized three armed columns, one proceeding north from Congo, one east from Niger and another south from Algeria. The objective was to link all French possessions in Western Africa, and this was achieved April 21, 1900 on the right bank of the Chari in what is now Chad opposite Kousséri, in what today is northern Cameroon.  Prelude  In 1899, Sudanese warlord Rabih az-Zubayr could field some 10,000 infantry and cavalry, all provided with rifles (except for 400 rifles, these were mostly obsolete), plus a great number of auxiliary troops equipped with lances or bows. His forces held fortified garrisons at Baggara and Karnak Logone. In 1899, Rabih received in Dikoa the French representative Ferdinand de Béhagle. The talks between them degenerated, and Béhagle was arrested. On July 17, 1899, Lieutenant Bretonnet, whose force was then sent by France against Rabih, was killed with most of his men at Togbao at the edge of the Chari River, present- day Sarh. Rabih gained three cannons from this victory (which the French later retook at Kousséri) and ordered his son Fadlallah, whom he had left in Dikoa, to hang Béhagle. In response, a French column proceeding from Gabon and led by Émile Gentil, supported by the steamboat Leon Blot, confronted Rabih at Kouno at the end of the year. The French were pushed back, suffering losses, but regrouped and continued to the town of Kousséri. Here, they linked up with the Lamy column (proceeding from Algeria) and the former Voulet-Chanoine Mission, proceeding from Niger. This column was now commanded by Joalland-Meynier, after Voulet and Chanoine murdered the French officer sent to relieve them, when news reached the European press of the mission's brutality to local people. Lamy took command of the united forces.  Battle  The final showdown between Rabih and the French took place on April 22, 1900. The French forces consisted of 700 troops, plus the 600 riflemen and 200 cavalry provided by the allied Baguirmians. Leaving Kousséri the French in three columns attacked Rabih's camp, and in the ensuing battle, the French commander Major Amédée-François Lamy was killed. However, Rabih's forces were overwhelmed and, while attempting to flee across the Chari River, Rabih was shot in the head by a skirmisher from the Central Africa mission. Hearing there was a bonus for Rabih's corpse, the skirmisher returned to the field and brought back Rabih's head and right hand. The casualties amounted to 28 dead and 75 wounded on the French side; 1,000 to 1,500 dead and more than 3,000 wounded on Rabah's side, including women and children accompanying the army.  Significance  With the defeat of Rabih's forces, the French ensured their control over most of Chad, which became part of the French colonial empire. The march of the infamous Voulet-Chanoine Mission through modern Burkina Faso and Niger brought nominal protectorate status to these areas, and forces from Algeria showed that a cross-saharan conquest and administration was possible. Gentile's mission from Gabon, added to these, helped define the practical borders of French and British imperial control, and linked the three most stable French colonial possessions in Africa (Senegal and the Upper Niger River Valley, Gabon and Congo-Brazzaville, and Algeria). In French colonial histories, the Battle of Kousséri is usually seen as the ending point of the Scramble for Africa and the beginning of the \\"pacification\\" phase of French West and Equatorial Africa.

He first appeared as Demolition-Man in Captain America #328 (April 1987). Fictional character biography Dennis Dunphy was born in Lincoln, Nebraska. Dennis becomes an aspiring athlete who receives the strength augmentation treatments offered by Power Broker, Inc. Finding himself too strong now for normal sports, he becomes a professional wrestler and member of the Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation (UCWF) along with other superheroes and supervillains such as the Beyonder, the Thing, and Screaming Mimi. He refuses to throw a fight with the Thing, and is defeated.Thing #28 (October 1985). The Puppet Master later mentally compels him to attack the Thing.Thing #34 (April 1986). Dunphy refuses the Power Broker's order to help kill Ms. Marvel. He reveals his addiction to the Power Broker's drug to the Thing, and goes through a painful withdrawal when the Power Broker cuts off his drug supply.Thing #35 (May 1986). After the fall of the UCWF, Dunphy becomes the Demolition Man and teams up with Captain America to investigate Power Broker, Inc. His costume is intentionally designed so the body of it is a duplicate of Daredevil's first costume, and the hood is a knock-off of Wolverine's. He successfully rescues Captain America from Karl Malus and helps Captain America catch him.Captain America #328 (April 1987). Dunphy is captured by the Power Broker and is subjected to further treatments which augment his strength further but damage his heart. While under the influence of the stimulant, he goes mad and attacks Captain America. Dunphy suffers a heart attack, his second augmentation is reversed and he is hospitalized.Captain America #330-331 (June–July 1987). Dunphy then takes a step back from superhero activity to take over Captain America's hotline. Soon after this, Steve Rogers is stripped of his Captain America costume by the Commission on Superhuman Activities (CSA) and goes missing. Demolition Man joins Falcon, Nomad, and Vagabond to search for Rogers. They discover Rogers, who had renamed himself simply \\"The Captain\\", and they all become a short- lived informal team.

When Dennis is finally released by the CSA, he seeks out the Captain, discovering that not only had his team disbanded, but that the East Coast Avengers team had also just disbanded and that the Captain is seeking new members. The Captain asks Demolition Man to join the Avengers and they immediately leave on a mission at the request of Battlestar. Battlestar's partner is John Walker, Captain America's replacement, who was captured by Flag-Smasher and his group ULTIMATUM. While Battlestar and the Captain investigated ULTIMATUM's Arctic base, Demolition Man is left with their plane. During the fight, the Captain discovers that Flag-Smasher's base contains a doomsday weapon (an electromagnetic pulse generator), and he orders Dunphy to set the plane on course to crash into the base and then bail out. Dennis sets the course, but then sees an enemy agent land on the plane. Dunphy elects to stay on the plane to ensure that it crashes. The plane explodes, apparently with Dunphy in it, and Captain America is unable to find any trace of him. left In a later adventure with Jack Frost, Captain America sees what he believes to be Dunphy's body frozen in suspended animation in ice near the North Magnetic Pole in the Arctic. However, he is unable to free him.Captain America #384 Demolition Man survived the explosion, but suffered wounds that rendered him mute and in a stupor, and is discovered living among the Inuit.

It was later established that Dunphy had become delusional and mentally unstable.The Pulse #13 (March 2006). His intentions remain pure, but he had begun to believe that a \\"Cosmic Gamemaster\\" had asked him to retrieve the seven Infinity Gems, which D-Man carried out by stealing common jewelry.

During the Dark Reign storyline, D-Man is shown to be serving in the U.S. military in his civilian identity and covertly in his Demolition Man costume. For a while, he inspires several of his fellow soldiers to operate covertly in costumes as well, but he puts a stop to it out of concern for their military careers. He continues operating by himself.

Operation Built at Swindon Works in August 1929 for a cost of £4375, the locomotive worked from a wide variety of sheds all over the GWR network, until withdrawal by British Railways in May 1963. It covered 1,344,464 miles over that period. Acquired by Woodham Brothers scrapyard in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, South Wales in October 1963, it was purchased by Dr John Kennedy in 1984. Preservation Moved to Tyseley Locomotive Works, it was restored to full mainline standard, and moved under its own power once again in February 2004. It made its first public appearance in 42 years at the Crewe Great Gathering in September 2005. It obtained its mainline certification in December 2005, after making the required light and loaded test runs from Birmingham to and back. In February 2007 the locomotive attended the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway's Winter Steam Gala, and on 19 May 2007 performed in tandem with 4965 Rood Ashton Hall on a trip to Bristol from their Tyseley base.

Milan- Sanremo  It is mainly known from cycling, as it is the final climb in the classic Milan–San Remo. The climb is 4 kilometers long with an average gradient of 3.7%. It is often the site of decisive attacks to the win. From the top of the Poggio, 7 km from the finish, the course heads down via a fast and curvy descent towards the center of San Remo where the race traditionally finishes on the Via Roma, the city's illustrious shopping street. In recent years there has rarely been a big selection in the latter stages of the race. Many sprinters are able to keep up with the main peloton on the climbs, and therefore the race most often ends in a group sprint. Nonetheless, the location of the Poggio close to the finish has often meant that riders' position on top of the Poggio is crucial in order to win the race. Despite its flat course and long finishing straight, sprinters' teams have been foiled from time to time by a determined attack on the last hills. In 2012 Vincenzo Nibali and Fabian Cancellara attacked on the Poggio, followed by Australian Simon Gerrans who outsprinted them at the finish.

On August 27, 2003 while working as the chairman of the Council of Directors of the Open Society Group of the company Milan he was registered by the electoral committee of the Chechen Republic as a presidential candidate.  Controversies  On September 11 , after Saidullaev - who is known in criminal circles as \\"the businessman of FSB\\" - was defamed by another presidential candidate, the Lubyanka poet Nikolay Paizullaev, the Supreme Court of the Chechen republic decided to cancel Saidullaev's registration, clearing the way to the president in Grozny for another pro-Moscow candidate Akhmad Kadyrov, who notoriously dismissed Saidullaev as 'too weak to rule'. Saidullaev commented at the briefing in Moscow: \\"Under the present circumstances I think the forthcoming elections to be a farce.\\" Following Akhmad Kadyrov's murder, Saidullaev again attempted to run for president until it was claimed that he was using a false Chechen passport.

In the film, he was portrayed by Lenny Montana, an ex-wrestler and ex-bodyguard for the Colombo crime family. Fictional character biography Luca Brasi is Mafia boss Vito Corleone's personal enforcer, and the only man in the world that he fears. While he is slow-witted and brutish, Brasi is feared throughout the criminal underworld as a savage killer. In one two-week killing spree, he murders six men who had attempted to assassinate Don Corleone, continuing his ferocious rampage until Vito called a halt to it, ending the \\"Olive Oil War.\\" Brasi's loyalty to Don Corleone is unquestioned, and he is said to have killed a Corleone soldier for making the Corleone family look bad. Brasi says he would sooner kill himself than betray the Godfather. In one early incident, Brasi kills two of Al Capone's henchmen who were hired to assassinate Don Corleone. Brasi subdued both men, binding and then gagging them with towels. As Brasi dismembered one with an axe, the other terrified man choked to death on the towel. Later in the novel, an old Sicilian woman, a former midwife, tells Vito's youngest son, Michael, that years earlier, Brasi murdered an Irish prostitute hours after she gave birth to his child. He then forced the midwife to put the live infant into a burning furnace. The distraught woman sought Vito Corleone's help. Don Corleone intervened, protecting the woman while covering up Brasi's crime and gaining his undying service and loyalty. Brasi was surprised to be invited to Connie Corleone's wedding, though Vito included him reluctantly, doing so only as a professional courtesy. To express his respect and gratitude, Brasi personally presents the Don a large cash gift for his daughter's bridal purse, purportedly the largest sum given. During the reception, Michael's girlfriend, Kay Adams, asks Michael about Brasi. He explains that his father once helped his godson Johnny Fontane's singing career with Brasi's assistance. Don Corleone had offered bandleader Les Halley $10,000 to release Fontane from a personal service contract that unfairly exploited Fontane's rising fame. When Halley refused, Don Corleone returned the next day with Luca Brasi to make Halley, \\"an offer he couldn't refuse\\". In the novel, Vito, accompanied by Brasi and consigliere Genco Abbandando, holds Halley at gunpoint after initially offering the bandleader $20,000, telling him that either his signature or his brains would be on the contract. The Don then pays $10,000 after forcing Halley to sign the release. In the film, Michael explains to Kay, Halley signed a release for only $1,000. To draw out rival mobster Virgil Sollozzo, Don Corleone orders Brasi to feign dissatisfaction working for the Corleones and desires to switch allegiances. Don Tattaglia, hearing this, arranges a meeting between Brasi and Sollozzo. Brasi arrives, wearing a bulletproof vest. Sollozzo, unfooled by the ruse, has him killed, then sends the vest stuffed with dead fish to the Corleones, an old Sicilian message saying that Brasi, \\"sleeps with the fishes\\". Luca Brasi's role as personal enforcer/bodyguard to the Don is later filled by Albert \\"Al\\" Neri. Following Neri's initiation, Vito tells Michael that he has his \\"Luca\\" now.  In other media  Luca Brasi plays a major role in the prequel novel The Family Corleone by Ed Falco. During the Great Depression, Luca Brasi is the leader of a small but feared gang, which makes deals with Vito's oldest son Sonny. The younger Brasi is described as a psychopath who kills his own newborn child by having it thrown alive into a burning furnace, lets its mother, his Irish- American girlfriend Kelly O'Rourke die, and abuses drugs. Brasi also wants to kill Tom Hagen for having a one-night stand with Kelly, a feud that Vito settles by paying Brasi off. Brasi suffers a drug overdose, which leads to a mental breakdown and stroke-like behavior. Although Vito dislikes and fears Brasi, he recruits him into his crime family, knowing that Brasi's formidable reputation would intimidate the Corleone family's enemies. Luca Brasi appears early on in The Godfather: The Game. Vito tells Brasi to rescue the protagonist, Aldo Trapani, from a brutal gang and train him. Brasi functions as a \\"trainer\\" for the player, demonstrating how to perform various game functions, such as shooting and punching. The player witnesses Brasi's eventual death and must escape to inform the family. Brasi inspired Baton Rouge rapper Kevin Gates to create his 2013 mixtape, The Luca Brasi Story, and its sequel, Luca Brasi 2, hosted by DJ Drama and released on December 15, 2014. According to film historian Laurent Bouzereau, the strangling death at the hands of Leia Organa of crime boss Jabba the Hutt's in Return of the Jedi was suggested by script writer Lawrence Kasdan. George Lucas decided Leia should strangle him with her slave chain, as he was inspired by Brasi's death scene from The Godfather.Bourezeau, Annoted Screenplays, p. 259.

of building Minis made of Fiber-Glass is gestated. After more than a year, on April 1990 an agreement is reached with RoverGroup Ltd. to obtain support, technical supervision, and to provide all the mechanical parts as well as all electric components, Facorca would assume the body, interior trim, radiator, radio, wheels, and tires. The factory molds itself for a maximum production of 10 cars per day, but the normal production would eventually become of 6 cars per day. 1992 Mini Cord built with a glass-fibre body in Venezuela On December 1991, the series production commences, assembling total of 113 Mini Cord on that month. Two basic models with 1000cc enter the market (the project of launching a 1275cc engine was never achieved): The Mini Cord FA, deluxe version, which brought amongst other things, air conditioning, complete leather interior trim, central console with tachometer, chrome bumpers, spotlights, Minilite Type GB wheels ; and the SB Mini Cord, Standard Version, with cloth interior trim, and steel wheels with deluxe wheel cups. All Colombian versions came with Minilite type GB wheels. In 1992 768 Mini Cords were produced, specifically for the Colombia, Venezuela, and Antilles market, of which 164 were imported to Colombia. That was the best year of production. If you visit the BMIHT museum (British Motor Industry Heritage Trust) you’ll be able to find, in a privileged place, amidst the most important Minis, a Red Mini Cord FA, with white roof. By 1993, a few improvements are made to both models, changing the interior trim to a better one, much more comfortable, original Rover rearview mirrors, and new design on the forward emblem. The 1993 Production descends to 391 units, due to the different economical problems, and problems among the partners, which drive the Factory to an almost decisive shut down. 62 Units are officially imported to Colombia, and the Distributors in Colombia, Mini City, cease to function as well. In 1994 it found itself in a very difficult financial situation, but the success in sales and of possible exportations to Colombia take the Company to the hands of Abisaad Janna & Cia, to which become convinced (by the partners left at Facorca) to re-open production. Projects of assembling Mini Cords restart, and two Beach Minis prototypes get to be built first, two unique convertibles, a conventional Mini with Kit Cooper 1.0 with 10-inch wheels, and another standard engine and Pilmico Style. Together with those, the Mini Cord with John Cooper 1.0 Kit deluxe is launched, with 13 inch Revolution wheels, Three-Clock-Central Drive Board, and Leather Interior. All should have been silver, although, because of special requests, some were painted otherwise, on other colors. The total production with Cooper and the standard versions by 1994 was of 24 units a great deal of these series reach Colombia, and all this due to the Economical situation of Facorca. This takes Abisaad Jana & Cia, to cancel their contract. In 1995 only 16 units are assembled and commences the dismantling the installations. Between the years 1991 and 1995, only 1310 Mini Cord were produced, in the standard and the Deluxe Version, Cooper and Convertibles, which takes it to be the smallest or at least of the smallest Mini Productions of a Mini ever.

Its successor was branded Windows Live. Office Live consisted of two services, Office Live Workspace, which was superseded by OneDrive,\\"Office Live Workspace to Bow to Office Web Apps, OneDrive\\" - Windows IT Pro and Office Live Small Business, which was superseded by Office 365. Office Live Workspace Office Live Workspace was a free service for storing and sharing documents online. The company claimed it was most commonly used for work, school, and home projects because documents could be managed from remote locations without a flash drive. The service required web access and a compatible browser; the interface was available in over 25 languages. Certain functionalities were tied to a browser plug-in called Silverlight, reducing the portability of the service in comparison to other providers of online office suites. In order for workspaces to be accessed directly from Office, users of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint needed to install an Office Live Update.Office Live Update from Microsoft Files couldn't be edited from within a workspace, but clicking on \\"edit\\" would open them up in Microsoft Office.\\"Office Live Workspace vs Google Docs: Feature-by-Feature Comparison\\" from ReadWriteWeb.com The workspace didn't offer offline collaboration — instead documents were \\"checked out\\" and \\"checked in\\" — but the service did integrate with SharedView for real-time screen sharing. =Features= * Online storage – Office Live permits users to save up to 5 gigabytes (GB) of information in many file formats from Microsoft, which can be accessed from any computer with an internet connection, even if Office isn't installed. The company claims this replaces the need for flash drives or CDs as a storage solution, and provides capabilities for updating project schedules, organizing events, and delegating assignments without scheduling a meeting or relying on email *Information sharing – Office Live Workspace is designed so that computer users can share a single document or a workspace containing multiple documents, as well as collaborate online as a group. Workspaces are password-protected and users can control who views and edits information. Files or workspaces can be shared with up to 100 people *Software compatibility – While Office Live Workspace works with Microsoft Office programs such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook, it also allows users to store documents of other file types. If the Office Live update is installed, files and documents may be opened and saved directly from Microsoft Office XP, 2003, 2007 or 2008 for Mac. Users may also synchronize,Connect your list to Outlook from Microsoft contact, task, and event lists with Outlook 2003 and 2007, and workspace lists can be exported to Excel.Export list content to an Excel spreadsheet from Microsoft However please note that the Office Live update is no longer available for download from Microsoft and is not supported. *Resources and support – Microsoft established a Community Support website,Office Live Workspace Community hosted by Microsoft which includes a blog, wiki, how-to videos, and the opportunity for customers to ask and answer questions about using Office Live Workspace =System requirements= Office Live Workspace requires an Internet-connected computer running Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Mac OS X 10.2.x and later.

Cyanophycin, also known as CGP (cyanophycin granule polypeptide) or multi-L-arginyl-poly (L-aspartic acid), is a non-protein, non-ribosomally produced amino acid polymer composed of an aspartic acid backbone and arginine side groups. Cyanophycin was first detected in 1887 by the Italian botanist Antonino Borzì and can be found in most cyanobacteria and a few heterotrophic bacteria such as Acinetobacter sp. Cyanophycin is largely insoluble under physiological conditions and is accumulated in the form of granules in the cytoplasm during phosphate or sulfur starvation, generally in the early and mid-stationary phase. It is used as a nitrogen- and possibly carbon-storage compound and also serves as a dynamic buffer for fixed nitrogen in cyanobacterial heterocysts. Nitrogen and carbon are mobilized from cyanophycin by intracellular cyanophycinase in the form of aspartate-arginine dipeptides. Cyanophycin is synthesized from arginine and aspartate in an ATP-dependent reaction catalyzed by a single enzyme, cyanophycin synthetase. Cyanophycin is of potential interest to biotechnology as a source of polyaspartic acid. Due to its unusual polyamphoteric character, cyanophycin is soluble in water under acidic (0.1 M HCl) and alkaline conditions. Heterologous expression of cyanophycin synthetase allows production of cyanophycin in a number of biotechnologically relevant bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Corynebacterium glutamicum. Since insoluble forms of CGP are easily purified, most studies have overlooked the synthesis of CPG that is soluble at a neutral pH. To compare the two, insoluble CGP can be solubilized by only weak acids while soluble CGP can be separated with the process of precipitation by using acetone or ethanol. In 2014, an experiment by Steinbüchel and Wiefel determined that the amount of lysine residue can regulate the solubility of cyanophycin, with higher levels of lysine negatively correlating to the temperature needed to make the polymer soluble with aqueous solvents. It was concluded that insoluble and soluble CGP are not distinct polymers, since they originate from the same polymer mixture, but are instead classified as mixes of cyanophycin mixtures with varying concentrations of lysine residues. The ability of lysine to partially replace the arginine side chain encouraged research of CPG variants with amino acids such as ornithine and citrulline. Lysine, ornithine and citrulline all have an affinity for cyanophycin synthase (L-aspartate-adding) enzyme CphA. Wiefel, Bröker and Steinbüchel conducted an experiment demonstrating that citrulline- rich cyanophycin can be produced through the introduction of a citrulline- producing strain. It was also determined that insoluble CGP only exhibited minuscule concentrations of citrulline while soluble CGP was able to produce a high concentration of citrulline. This trend is also similar for ornithine.

The condition is marked by induration (swelling or hardening of normally soft tissue) of a normally aerated lung. It is considered a radiologic sign. Consolidation occurs through accumulation of inflammatory cellular exudate in the alveoli and adjoining ducts. The liquid can be pulmonary edema, inflammatory exudate, pus, inhaled water, or blood (from bronchial tree or hemorrhage from a pulmonary artery). Consolidation must be present to diagnose pneumonia: the signs of lobar pneumonia are characteristic and clinically referred to as consolidation. Signs Signs that consolidation may have occurred include: *Expansion of the thorax on inspiration is reduced on the affected side *Vocal fremitus is increased on the affected side *Percussion is dull in the affected area *Breath sounds are bronchial *Possible medium, late, or pan-inspiratory crackles *Vocal resonance is increased. Here, the patient's voice (or whisper, as in whispered pectoriloquy) can be heard more clearly when there is consolidation, as opposed to the healthy lung where speech sounds muffled. *A pleural rub may be present. *A lower PAO2 than calculated in the alveolar gas equation Diagnosis =Radiology= * Typically, an area of white lung is seen on a standard X-ray. Consolidated tissue is more radio-opaque than normally aerated lung parenchyma, so that it is clearly demonstrable in radiography and on CT scans.

Because DWF files are highly compressed, they are smaller and faster to transmit than design files, without the overhead associated with complex CAD drawings (or the management of external links and dependencies). With DWF functionality, publishers of design data can limit the specific design data and plot styles to only what they want recipients to see and can publish multisheet drawing sets from multiple AutoCAD drawings in a single DWF file. They can also publish 3D models from most Autodesk design applications. DWF files are not a replacement for native CAD formats such as AutoCAD drawings (DWG). The sole purpose of DWF is to allow designers, engineers, project managers, and their colleagues to communicate design information and design content to anyone needing to view, review, or print design information – without these team members needing to know AutoCAD or other design software. An Autodesk DWF advocate blog cites as DWFs strengths over alternatives that the files have very high mathematical precision, and contain meta-data for sheets, objects and markup data. Another significant strength is that comments and markup can be reintroduced to, and edited in, some Autodesk products, such as Revit and AutoCAD. The AutoCAD file format (.dwfx) is based on ISO/IEC 29500-2:2008 Open Packaging Conventions.http://blogs.msdn.com/opc/archive/2009/05/18/adventures-in- packaging-episode-1.aspx  Technology  DWF is a file format developed by Autodesk for representing design data in a manner that is independent of the original application software, hardware, and operating system used to create that design data. A DWF file can describe design data containing any combination of text, graphics, and images in a device independent and resolution independent format. These files can be one sheet or multiple sheets, very simple or extremely complex with a rich use of fonts, graphics, color, and images. The format also includes intelligent metadata that captures the design intent of the data being represented. The DWF technology centers on three components: * C++ libraries for developers * a viewer for project team members who wish to view design data without knowing AutoCAD * a writer that allows anyone to create a DWF file from any application = DWF Toolkit = DWF is an open file format. Autodesk publishes the DWF specification and makes available C++ librarieshttp://www.autodesk.com/dwftoolkit for any developer who wants to build applications around the DWF format, with the DWF Toolkit. Furthermore, DWF is based on other industry standards such as ZLIB, XML, and common image formats. DWF files (since version 6.0) are a ZIP-compressed container for the drawing files; despite the first few bytes of the file containing a DWF header, renaming a .dwf file to .zip will allow the component files inside to be viewed with archive compression software. Amongst various XML and binary files, is a PNG format thumbnail preview. DWF can be interfaced with .NET Libraries. = Design Review = Autodesk Design Review is a free viewing application that enables all members of the project team to easily view, measure, markup and print designs shared electronically. Built around the DWF file format, Design Review enables users to view and print complex 2D and 3D drawings, maps, and models published from Autodesk design applications or from the DWF Writer. Also, all Markups and Annotations created in Design Review can be imported to the original file when using Autodesk applications, such as AutoCAD, Inventor or Revit Architectural. This feature makes DWF the ideal format for design reviewing and collaboration processes. The below statement is no longer true as an update to Autodesk Design Review was released in 2017 According to an Autodesk representative on the Official Autodesk user Forums, the Design Review software is being discontinued. No new versions have been released since 2013. The 2013 version will remain available as a free download until such time as Autodesk decides that the functionality of Design Review can be replaced with some combination of other cloud-based products, such as Autodesk 360, Vault.. = DWF Writer = Autodesk DWF Writer software publishes the DWF format from CAD applications that do not offer built-in DWF publishing, such as Bentley MicroStation or Dassault's Solidworks software. Autodesk DWF Writer is a Windows printer driver that converts files to DWF format. The result is that the entire project team can standardize on a common file format to exchange and review designs and sheet sets, at no additional cost. = Freewheel = In 2007, Autodesk introduced an online translator for DWFs called Freewheel. Freewheel was a way to view a DWF file without downloading software. It was also a web service which offered developers a web-based interface for viewing, querying, and manipulating DWF files. Freewheel has been replaced by the web based viewing and editing web service Autodesk 360. = Platforms = Autodesk's DWF viewers (except for Freewheel) are all based on Microsoft Windows. The DWF Toolkit is available on Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. Third parties have created DWF tools on other platforms besides Windows; an example is the Mac OS X viewer McDwiff .  History  The DWF format first appeared in 1995 as part of the unveiling of Autodesk's \\"WHIP!\\" Netscape Navigator plug-in. The format was originally referred to as the Drawing Web Format, since DWF files were generated by the Autodesk Internet Publishing Kit. As the format grew in use beyond just AutoCAD, it was renamed to Design Web Format. Although originally a 2D-only format, DWF has evolved to include 3D. Today DWF files are generated by all Autodesk products. In addition, there are a variety of third-party applications that make use of the format.  Alternatives  PDF is an internationally recognized open file format developed by Adobe Systems to allow electronic exchange of any printable document, independent of the source application software, hardware and operating system. PDF/E is a subset of v1.6 of the PDF specification specifically designed for engineering use. SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an open, XML based file format. It is suitable for use both as a format for creating and editing drawings and as a format for viewing and publication. For instance, Inkscape uses SVG as its native format, and both the Firefox and Opera browsers natively display SVG.

The species was first described by Johan Christian Fabricius in 1793. Description Aberration of zebra blue butterfly seen in Bangalore Opened wings of a female This form closely resembles, in both sexes, on the upperside of Tarucus theophrastus, but the character and disposition of the markings on the underside are completely different. Male upperside: dark violet with, in certain lights, a rich blue suffusion. Forewing: no discocellular black spot so conspicuous as in T. theophrastus; terminal margin with a narrow edging of fuscous black, widest at the apex, gradually decreasing to the tornus, followed by an inconspicuous anteciliary jet-black line. Hindwing: costal margin slightly but broadly shaded with fuscous, which is continued as a slender anteciliary black line to the tornus. Underside: white. Forewing: with the following brownish-black markings: an irregular edging along the costa to near the apex from which extends downwards a subbasal band, broadened across the cell and below it; an irregular band that extends along the discocellulars and below them to interspace 1 where it ends in a point; an upper discal curved band of more even width but dislocated below vein 4, the lower portion of it shifted inwards forms a large quadrate spot in interspace 3, below vein 3 the band is continued downwards by two small inconspicuous spots, beyond this is a very short acutely pointed comma- shaped mark; a very regular evenly curved complete transverse lunular line, a transverse series of subterminal spots and an anteciliary slender line. Close to the base of the wing extended obliquely upwards and outwards from the dorsum is a triangular mark, the edging of white colour left near the base forms above the apex of this mark an acute angle; between the band that crosses the middle of the cell and the transverse discocellular band is a more or less slender, irregular, similarly coloured line; and between the discocellular and upper discal bands another much shorter line that extends from the costa downwards but does not reach vein 4, this is slightly clavate anteriorly and posteriorly. Hindwing: mottled with brownish black that leaves only basal, subbasal, medial and discal transverse lines or bands of the ground colour; the medial and discal bands, which are highly irregular, enclose here and there small brownish markings, the bands themselves coalescing above a very irregularly shaped brown mark that is placed on the posterior half of the middle of the wing; terminal markings as on the forewing but the subterminal spots larger, the apical one especially so, the tornal two spots jet-black and each encircled by a glittering slender ring of metallic green scales. Cilia of both forewings and hindwings, the antennae, head, thorax and abdomen much as in T. theophrastus. Female. Upperside very closely resembles that of female T. theophrastus, but the extent of white on the forewing is greater so that there is a greater area of white to be seen between the brown markings superposed on it, these markings have the appearance of an irregularly formed V on a white background. Hindwing much as in T. theophrastus. Underside: similar to that of its own male but the brown bands less broken, more regular. Cilia, antennae, head, thorax and abdomen as in the male. It is found in the Ethiopian region, the north-western Himalayas to Kumaon, the plains of northern India; central and western India, Sri Lanka, Assam, Myanmar, Tenasserim in the low hot valleys of the north; extending to China and in the Malayan subregion to Java. The description given above is taken from males and females of wet-season broods. Specimens of the dry-season broods are paler on the upperside with, in the male only anteciliary black lines to the wings. On the underside the markings on the wings will, on careful examination, be found very similar but paler brown and all very much reduced in width so that a greater extent of the white ground colour is visible.

Its predecessor regiment was raised in 1685 as Henry Cornwall's Regiment of Foot. In 1751, it was numbered like most other British Army regiments and named the 9th Regiment of Foot. It was formed as the Norfolk Regiment in 1881 under the Childers Reforms of the British Army as the county regiment of Norfolk by merging the 9th (East Norfolk) Regiment of Foot with the local Militia and Rifle Volunteers battalions.The other regiment linked with Norfolk, the 54th Regiment of Foot, became part of the Dorsetshire Regiment. The Norfolk Regiment fought in the Great War on the Western Front and in the Middle East. After the war, the regiment became the Royal Norfolk Regiment on 3 June 1935. The regiment fought with distinction in the Second World War, in action in the Battle of France and Belgium, the Far East, and then in the invasion of, and subsequent operations in, North-west Europe. In 1959, the Royal Norfolk Regiment was amalgamated with the Suffolk Regiment, to become the 1st East Anglian Regiment (Royal Norfolk and Suffolk); this later amalgamated with the 2nd East Anglian Regiment (Duchess of Gloucester's Own Royal Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire), the 3rd East Anglian Regiment (16th/44th Foot) and the Royal Leicestershire Regiment to form the Royal Anglian Regiment, of which A Company of the 1st Battalion is known as the Royal Norfolks.

Cornewall resigned his post following the Glorious Revolution and command went to Colonel Oliver Nicholas in November 1688.Cannon, p. 4 In December 1688, Nicholas was also removed due to his personal Jacobite sympathies and command passed to John Cunningham.Cannon, p. 5 In April 1689 the regiment, under Cunningham's command, embarked at Liverpool for Derry for service in the Williamite War in Ireland. Cunningham led a failed attempt to relieve the besieged city of Derry. The regiment briefly returned to England, but in May 1689 Cunningham was replaced by William Stewart, under whom the regiment took part in a successful relief of Derry in summer 1689.Cannon, p. 6 The regiment also saw action at the Battle of the Boyne in July 1690,Cannon, p. 9 the Siege of Limerick in August 1690 and the Siege of Athlone in June 1691.Cannon, p. 10 It went on to fight at the Battle of Aughrim in July 1691Cannon, p. 11 and the Siege of Limerick in August 1691.Cannon, p. 12 Soldier of 9th regiment, 1742 In 1701, over the objections of General William Selwyn, the threat of war led the English government to post an Independent Company of regular soldiers, detached from the 2nd Regiment of Foot, to Bermuda, where the militia continued to function as a standby in case of war or insurrection.

Crew and passengers were saved and conducted to Calais. =Napoleonic Wars= Sir John Moore's tomb in San Carlos Garden at A Coruña: the 9th Regiment conducted the burial in January 1809 In June 1808, the regiment sail for Portugal for service in the Peninsular War.Cannon, p. 44 It saw action at the Battle of Roliça and the Battle of Vimeiro in August 1808.Cannon, p. 46 Following the retreat from Corunna, the regiment buried Sir John Moore (commander of the British forces in the Iberian peninsula) and left Spanish soil.Cannon, p. 49 The regiment then took part in the disastrous Walcheren expedition to the Low Countries in summer 1809.Cannon, p. 52 The regiment returned to the Peninsula in March 1810 and fought under Wellington at Battle of Bussaco, Portugal in September 1810,Cannon, p. 53 the Battle of Sabugal in April 1811 and the Battle of Fuentes de Oñoro in May 1811.Cannon, p. 58 It also saw action at the Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo in January 1812, the Siege of Badajoz in March 1812 and the Battle of Salamanca in July 1812.Cannon, p. 61 It saw further combat at the Siege of Burgos in September 1812,Cannon, p. 62 the Battle of Vitoria in June 1813Cannon, p. 64 and the Siege of San Sebastián in September 1813.Cannon, p. 66 The regiment pursued the French Army into France and fought them at the Battle of Nivelle in November 1813Cannon, p. 71 and the Battle of the Nive in December 1813.Cannon, p. 72 The regiment was sent to Canada with most of Wellington's veteran units to prevent the threatened invasion by the United States, and so arrived in Europe too late for the Battle of Waterloo.Cannon, p. 76 The 1st Battalion participated in the Army of Occupation in France, whilst the 2nd Battalion was disbanded at the end of 1815.Cannon, p. 79 =The Victorian era= An officer of the East Norfolk Militia, which later became 4th Battalion, Royal Norfolk Regiment The regiment saw action at Kabul in August 1842 during the First Anglo-Afghan WarCannon, p. 92 and at the Battle of Mudki and the Battle of Ferozeshah in December 1845Cannon, p. 102 and the Battle of Sobraon in February 1846 during the First Anglo-Sikh War.Cannon, p. 109 The Norfolk Artillery Militia was formed in 1853.The History of the 4th Battalion Norfolk Regiment 1899 -p122 \\"The Norfolk Artillery Militia marched into the barracks at Southtown on Friday last, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel Astley.\\" Such are almost the words of the announcement under our Yarmouth heading this week.

The regiment saw action at Kabul again in 1879 during the Second Anglo-Afghan War. The regiment was not fundamentally affected by the Cardwell Reforms of the 1870s, which gave it a depot at Gorleston Barracks in Great Yarmouth from 1873, or by the Childers reforms of 1881 – as it already possessed two battalions, there was no need for it to amalgamate with another regiment. The depot was the 31st Brigade Depot from 1873 to 1881, and the 9th Regimental District depot thereafter Under the reforms the regiment became The Norfolk Regiment on 1 July 1881. It had two regular battalions (1st and 2nd) and two militia battalions (the 3rd and 4th - the latter formed from the East Norfolk Militia). It inherited all the battle honours and traditions of its predecessor regiment.Beckett, p. 86 The 1st battalion was stationed in Gibraltar from 1887, then in British India. The 3rd (Militia) Battalion (the former 1st Norfolk Militia) was embodied in January 1900 for service during the Second Boer War in South Africa. 540 officers and men left Queenstown in the SS Orotava the following month for Cape Town. As the Norfolk Regiment, it first saw action at the Battle of Poplar Grove in March 1900 during the Second Boer War. In 1908, the Volunteers and Militia were reorganised nationally, with the former becoming the Territorial Force and the latter the Special Reserve; the regiment now had one Reserve and three Territorial battalions.These were the 3rd Battalion (Special Reserve), with the 4th Battalion at St. Giles in Norwich, the 5th Battalion at Quebec Street in Dereham and the 6th (Cyclist) Battalion at Rosary Road in Norwich (since demolished) (all Territorial Force). =First World War= Regular Army The 1st Battalion was serving in Ireland upon the outbreak of the war and was given orders to mobilise on 4 August, the day that Britain declared war on Germany. Part of the 15th Brigade, 5th Division the battalion left Belfast on 14 August and immediately embarked for France, where they became part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). They saw their first action of the war against the German Army at the Battle of Mons in August 1914. The 2nd Battalion was serving in Bombay, India in the 18th (Belgaum) Brigade, part of the 6th (Poona) Division, of the British Indian Army, upon the outbreak of war. The 2nd Battalion of the Norfolks fought in the Mesopotamian campaign. The treatment of prisoners after the fall of Kut al Amara in April 1916 mirrors that that would later befall the Royal Norfolks in the Far East during the Second World War. Territorial Force The two Territorial Force battalions, the 4th and 5th, were both part of the Norfolk and Suffolk Brigade, part of the East Anglian Division. In May 1915 these became the 163rd (Norfolk and Suffolk) Brigade, 54th (East Anglian) Division.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 125–31. The two territorial battalions both served in the Gallipoli campaign in mid-1915. The 1/5th included men recruited from the Royal estate at Sandringham. On 12 August 1915, the 1/5th Battalion suffered heavy losses at Gallipoli when it became isolated during an attack. A myth grew up long after the War that the men had advanced into a mist and simply disappeared. A BBC TV drama, All the King's Men (1999), starring David Jason as Captain Frank Beck, was based upon their story. In the Second Battle of Gaza in 1917, the 1/4th and 1/5th battalions suffered 75% casualties, about 1,100 men.Eastern Daily Press Sunday section, 5 May 2007 The 1/6th (Cyclist) Battalion was in Norwich on the outbreak of war: however, the 1/6th never served overseas and remained instead in Norfolk throughout the war until 1918 when it was sent to Ireland. The 2/4th and 2/5th battalions were both raised in September 1914 from the few men of the 4th and 5th battalions who did not volunteer for Imperial Service overseas when asked. Therefore, Territorial units were split into 1st Line units, which were liable to serve overseas, and 2nd Line units, which were intended to act as a reserve for the 1st Line serving overseas. To distinguish them, all battalions adopted the '1/' or '2/' prefix (1/4th Norfolks as a 1st Line unit, 2/4th Norfolks as a 2nd Line unit). The 2/4th and 2/5th were part of the 2nd Norfolk and Suffolk Brigade, 2nd East Anglian Division, later, in August 1915, they became 208th (2/1st Norfolk and Suffolk) Brigade, 69th (2nd East Anglian) Division.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 91–8. However, both battalions were disbanded in 1918: the 2/4th in June and the 2/5th in May. The 2/6th (Cyclist) Battalion, formed in October 1914 as a duplicate of the 1/6th (Cyclist) Battalion, had much the same history as the 1/6th Battalion and remained in the United Kingdom until May 1918 when it was disbanded. The Norfolk Yeomanry (TF), having fought dismounted in the Gallipoli Campaign, were withdrawn to Egypt, where they were reorganised as infantry and redesignated as the 12th (Norfolk Yeomanry) Battalion, Norfolk Regiment, in the 74th (Yeomanry) Division (the 'Broken Spur' division). The battalion fought in the Palestine Campaign at the Third Battle of Gaza (the Battles of Beersheba and Nebi Samwi) in 1917, and distinguished itself at the Battle of Tell Azur in March 1918. The 74th Division was then sent to reinforce the BEF in France, where the 12th Norfolks were detached to the 31st Division, with which the battalion served during the final Hundred Days Offensive.Norfolk Yeomanry at Long, Long Trail.Mileham, p. 101.Ward.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 117–22.Becke, Pt 3b, pp. 11–9. Service battalions Sir John Anderson, the Governor General of Bengal; Dacca, British India, 1933. The 7th (Service) Battalion, Norfolk Regiment was raised in August 1914 from men volunteering for Kitchener's New Armies: it landed at Boulogne-sur-Mer as part of the 35th Brigade in the 12th (Eastern) Division in May 1915 for service on the Western Front. The 8th (Service) Battalion landed at Boulogne as part of the 53rd Brigade of the 18th (Eastern) Division in July 1915 and was present on the first day of the Battle of the Somme on 1 July 1916. The 9th (Service) Battalion landed at Boulogne as part of the 71st Brigade in the 24th Division in August 1915 for operations on the Western Front. The 10th (Service) Battalion, raised in 1914, became the 10th (Reserve) Battalion in April 1915. Victoria Cross During the war, Lieutenant Colonel Jack Sherwood Kelly, a Norfolk Regiment officer, was awarded the Victoria Cross while leading a trench assault by Irish troops during the Battle of Cambrai in 1917. =Second World War= John Niel Randle VC The regiment was renamed to the Royal Norfolk Regiment on 3 June 1935 to celebrate 250 years since the regiment was first raised and also to celebrate the Silver Jubilee of King George V. In 1940, the first decorations for gallantry awarded to the British Expeditionary Force in France were gained by men of the 2nd Battalion. Captain Frank Peter Barclay, was awarded the Military Cross, and Lance-Corporal Davis the Military Medal. Captain F.P. Barclay would later lead the 1st Battalion in the North West Europe Campaign towards the end of the war. Five members of the Royal Norfolks, the highest number of any British Army regiment during the Second World War, were awarded the Victoria Cross: * David Auldjo Jamieson * John Niel Randle * George Gristock * Sidney Bates * George Arthur Knowland Regular Army battalions The 1st Battalion was a regular army unit that was stationed in India at the outbreak of war and was recalled to Britain, arriving in July 1940 during the Battle of Britain. They were part of the 185th Infantry Brigade originally assigned to the 79th Armoured Division but the brigade (including the 2nd Royal Warwickshire Regiment and 2nd King's Shropshire Light Infantry) transferred to the 3rd Infantry Division, with which it would remain with for the rest of the war. The battalion landed on Red Queen Beach, the left flank of Sword Beach, at 07:25 on 6 June 1944, D-Day, and fought with distinction through the Normandy Campaign and throughout the North West Europe Campaign. On 6 August 1944 at Sourdeval, Sidney Bates of B Company was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for his great courage in the Battle of Sourdevallee against the crack 10th SS Panzer Division. Lieutenant General Miles Dempsey, the British Second Army commander, stated that by holding their ground in the battle the battalion made the subsequent breakthrough in August possible. By the end of the war in Europe, the 1st Battalion had gained a remarkable reputation and was claimed by Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery, the 21st Army Group commander, as 'second to none' of all the battalions in the 21st Army Group. The 1st Royal Norfolks had suffered 20 officers and 260 other ranks killed with well over 1,000 wounded or missing in 11 months of almost continuous combat.Further information on this unit can be found in Thank God and the Infantry - From D-Day to VE-Day with the 1st Battalion The Royal Norfolk Regiment, by John Lincoln who himself served as a young 20-year- old Officer Commanding 17 Platoon, D Company, in the 1st Battalion in 1944 and was awarded the Military Cross. Monument at Biéville-Beuville, Normandy, in memory of 116 comrades who fell between D-Day 6 June and 9 July 1944. During the Battle of France in 1940, Company Sergeant-Major George Gristock of the 2nd Royal Norfolks was awarded the Victoria Cross. During the battle, members of the Royal Norfolks were victims of a German war crime at Le Paradis in the Pas-de-Calais on 26 May. Men of the 2nd Battalion, Royal Norfolk Regiment receive their rum ration before going out on patrol in France, 26 January 1940. The 2nd Battalion, Royal Norfolk Regiment, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Eric Hayes, were attached to the 4th Infantry Brigade, part of the 2nd Infantry Division, which was holding the line of the La Bassée Canal and covering the retreat to Dunkirk. Units became separated from each other and HQ Company had formed a defensive position based at the Duriez farmhouse. They carried on their defence until the afternoon, by which point many were injured and the enemy were shelling the farm. Making a last stand in the open they were outnumbered and surrendered to a unit of the 2nd Infantry Regiment of the SS 'Totenkopf' (Death's Head) Division, under SS Obersturmfuhrer Fritz Knoechlein. The 99 prisoners were marched to some farm buildings on another farm where they were lined up alongside a barn wall. They were then fired upon by two machine guns; 97 were killed and the bodies buried in a shallow pit. Privates Albert Pooley and William O'Callaghan had hidden in a pigsty and were discovered later by the farm's owner, Mme Creton, and her son. The two soldiers were later captured by a Wehrmacht unit and spent the rest of the war as prisoners of war. The bodies of the murdered soldiers were exhumed in 1942 by the French and reburied in the local churchyard which now forms part of the Le Paradis War Cemetery. A memorial plaque was placed on the barn wall in 1970. The massacre was investigated by the War Crimes Investigation Unit and Knoechlein was traced and arrested. Tried in a court in Hamburg, he was found guilty and hanged on 28 January 1949. The 2nd Battalion, still as part of the 4th Infantry Brigade of the 2nd Infantry Division, also served in the Far East in the Burma Campaign participating in battles such as the Battle of Kohima until the end of the war against Japan in 1945. They served with the British Fourteenth Army, known as the 'Forgotten Army' as their actions were generally over-looked and the main focus was in the North West Europe Campaign. The Fourteenth Army was commanded by the popular and highly respected William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim. Both John Niel Randle and George Arthur Knowland were posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross whilst serving with the 2nd Battalion in the Far East, both for extraordinary heroism. Territorial Army battalions The 4th, 5th and 6th battalions, all part of the Territorial Army, served in the Far East. The 5th and 6th (City of Norwich) were both assigned to the 53rd Infantry Brigade, and the 4th Battalion the 54th Infantry Brigade. Both brigades were part of the 18th Infantry Division. Throughout most of their existence, all three battalions remained in the United Kingdom assigned to coastal defence duties and training to repel a German invasion and, in October 1941, the division left, destined for the Middle East. The 18th Division fought in the defence of Singapore and Malaya against the Japanese advance. The men of these battalions, and other East Anglian battalions of other regiments, ended up as prisoners of war when Singapore fell in February 1942. They would remain so until August 1945, during which time they were used as forced labour on projects such as the Death Railway through Burma. The 7th Battalion, Royal Norfolk Regiment was formed in May 1939 as a 2nd Line Territorial Army duplicate of the 5th Battalion and, therefore, contained many former members of the 5th. Together with the 5th and 6th battalions, the 7th was assigned to the 53rd Infantry Brigade, part of the 18th Infantry Division until November when it assigned to pioneer duties in France with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). In May 1940, it was assigned to the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division. The 51st Division was stationed on the Maginot Line and therefore escaped encirclement with the rest of the BEF during the Battle of France where they spent some time attached to the French Tenth Army. The 7th Royal Norfolks suffered heavy casualties when the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division was surrounded and had no choice but to surrender, on 12 June 1940, with only 31 members of the battalion managing to return to Britain. In October 1940 the battalion was assigned to 205th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home), then the 220th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home). On 14 October 1942, the battalion was transferred to the 176th Infantry Brigade, alongside the 7th Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment and 6th Battalion, North Staffordshire Regiment, of the 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division.Joslen, p. 355 The 59th Division was one of the follow-up units after D-Day in June 1944 and was considered by General Bernard Montgomery as one of his best divisions. On the night of 7/8 August 1944, Captain David Auldjo Jamieson of D Company was awarded the Victoria Cross for his heroic leadership which greatly helped to fend off several enemy counter-attacks in a 36-hour period. Due to an acute shortage of infantrymen in the British Army at the time, the battalion and division were disbanded in late August 1944 and its men used as replacements for other British divisions in the 21st Army Group who had also suffered heavy casualties in Normandy. Monument on Royal Norfolkplein, Helmond, Netherlands, recording the liberation of the town on 25 September 1944 by the 1st Battalion, Royal Norfolk Regiment. Hostilities-only battalions The 8th Battalion was raised in 1939 alongside the 9th Battalion with many veterans of the Great War. Both battalions were used mainly to supply reinforcements to those battalions of the regiment that were overseas. Neither of these battalions saw service overseas and remained in the United Kingdom throughout the war as part of the Home Forces with the 9th Battalion apparently being disbanded in August 1944 when its parent unit (25th Brigade attached to 47th (Reserve) Infantry Division) was disbanded.Joslen, p. 272 The 8th Battalion was renumbered as the 30th Battalion and used for garrison duties in Italy during which the 43rd Infantry Brigade, which included 30th Battalion, Somerset Light Infantry and 30th Battalion, Dorset Regiment, was made to appear as a full division for deception purposes. The battalion remained in Italy until it was disbanded in 1946. The 50th (Holding) Battalion was raised in late May 1940. The role of the Holding battalion was to temporarily 'hold' men who were homeless, medically unfit, awaiting orders, on a course or returning from abroad. The battalion was renumbered as the 9th Battalion in October and was assigned to the 220th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home), part of Norfolk County Division in early 1941.Joslen, p. 383 The 70th (Young Soldiers) Battalion was raised in late 1940 for those young soldiers, mostly around the ages of 18 or 19, who had volunteered for the Army and therefore had not reached the compulsory age for conscription. The battalion spent most of its time in the UK guarding against a German invasion. However, the battalion was disbanded in 1943 due to the British government lowering the age of conscription to the British Armed Forces to 18 earlier in the year. This decision was due to a growing shortage of manpower, especially in the British Army and in the infantry in particular and the young soldiers of the disbanded 70th were sent to other battalions of the regiment serving overseas. =Post Second World War= The regiment served in Korea in 1951–52 during the Korean War, and in Cyprus in the fight against EOKA in 1955–56. In 1959 the Royal Norfolk Regiment was amalgamated as part of the reorganisation of the British Army resulting from the 1957 Defence White Paper becoming part of a new formation, the 1st East Anglian Regiment, part of the East Anglian Brigade. Regimental museum The history of the Royal Norfolk Regiment and its predecessors and successors is recorded at the Royal Norfolk Regimental Museum. The museum moved from the Britannia Barracks, now part of Norwich prison, to the Shirehall and then to the Norwich Castle Museum. Although archives and the reserve collections are still held in the Shirehall, the principal museum display there closed in September 2011, and relocated to the main Norwich Castle Museum, reopening fully in 2013. Its exhibits illustrate the history of the Regiment from its 17th-century origins to its incorporation into the Royal Anglian Regiment in 1964, along with many aspects of military life in the Regiment. There is an extensive and representative display of medals awarded to soldiers of the Regiment, including two of the six Victoria Crosses won. Uniform and insignia The dress worn by the Regiment's predecessor units in the late 17th and early 18th centuries included orange and subsequently green facings. In 1733, official permission was given to change from bright green back to light orange facings. By 1747, this unusual shade had evolved into yellow, which was retained until 1881 when, in common with all English and Welsh regiments, the newly renamed Norfolk Regiment was given white distinctions on its scarlet tunics. In 1905, the traditional yellow facings were restored for full dress and mess uniforms. Another distinction of the Norfolk Regiment was the inclusion of a black line in the gold braid of officers' uniforms from 1881 onwards. When the regiment was redesignated as the \\"Royal Norfolk Regiment\\" in 1935, it was specially permitted to retain the yellow facings instead of changing to blue. The figure of Britannia was officially recognised in 1799 as part of the insignia of the 9th Regiment of Foot.Horse Guards Letter dated 30 July 1799: \\"His Majesty has been pleased to confirm to the 9th Regiment of Foot the distinction and privilege of bearing the figure of Britannia as the badge of the Regiment.\\" Regimental tradition claimed that it was granted to the regiment by Queen Anne in 1707 in recognition of its service at the Battle of Almanza. However, there is no evidence that it was used before the 1770s, and it was not listed as an authorised device in the royal warrants of 1747, 1751 or 1768. It subsequently became a central part of the badge of the Norfolk Regiment. Traditions The Royal Norfolk Regiment held an anniversary on 25 April for the Battle of Almansa, which they inherited along with the regimental nickname of the \\"Holy Boys\\" from the 9th Regiment of Foot. They gained the \\"Holy Boys\\" nickname during the Peninsular War from the misidentification by a Spanish soldier of Britannia on their cap badge as the Virgin Mary.

He is most widely known as the founder of the neopolicial genre of novel in Latin America and is also a prominent member of the international crime writing community. His Spanish language work has won numerous awards including two Latin American Dashiell Hammett Prizes. In 2018, Taibo was appointed as head of the Fondo de Cultura Económica by President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Biography Taibo has lived in Mexico City since the age of 9, when in 1958 his family fled from Spain to escape the fascist dictatorship of Francisco Franco. Taibo II is an intellectual, historian, professor, journalist, social activist, union organizer, and world-renowned writer. Widely known for his policial novels, he is considered the founder of the neopolicial genre in Latin America and is the president of the International Association of Political Writers.Editor's introduction. Paco Ignacio Taibo II. 2003. Suenos de Frontera/Desvanecidos Difuntos/Adios Madrid. Editorial Planeta. Mexico. One of the most prolific writers in Mexico today, over 500 editions of his 51 books have been published in 29 countries and over a dozen languages, and include novels, narrative, historical essays, chronicles, and poetry. Some of PIT's novels have been mentioned among the \\"Books of the Year\\" by The New York Times, Le Monde, and the Los Angeles Times. He has received numerous awards including the Grijalbo, the Planeta/Joaquin Mortiz in 1992, the Dashiell Hammett three times for his policial novels, and the 813 for the best police novel published in France. His biography of Ernesto \\"Che\\" Guevara (Ernesto Guevara, tambien conocido como el Che, 1996) has sold over half a million copies around the world and won the 1998 Bancarella Book of the Year award in Italy. PIT's readership has developed into a cult following. Once when he gave a talk about Mexican Independence hero Miguel Hidalgo in Mexico City, his presentation turned into a rally. His readers consider him their friend and when his presentations are over, people approach him to give him gifts such as cigarettes, apples, and sodas. A socially and politically conscious writer, PIT's writings respond to and speak of the social pressures he experienced as a young man and allow him to tell what's behind every criminal story: corruption and repression of the political system in Mexico. A militant and veteran of the 1968 student movement in Mexico, his book '68 (published by Seven Stories Press in 2004) was inspired by the events of that year and direct personal experience, it tells the story of the movement including the Tlatelolco massacre of student protesters in Mexico City by government troops: at the La Plaza de las Tres Culturas, thousands of people were arrested, hundreds killed, and hundreds are still missing. To date nobody has been held accountable for these crimes.Taibo, P.I. 2004. 68. Editorial Planeta, Mexico. Among PIT's most popular works is a series of detective novels, written against the prevailing bourgeois state in Mexico in the last few decades of the 20th century, with the protagonist, Mexican Private Investigator Héctor Belascoarán Shayne, who was introduced in the novel Días de combate. PIT wrote eight more novels with this character. Other novels include: Cuatro manos (Four Hands); Sombra de la sombra (Shadow of the Shadow); Amorosos fantasmas; and Temporada de Zopilotes: Una historia narrativa sobre la Decena Trágica (Buzzards' season: A narrative history about the Ten Tragic Days) and, the last of the series, Muertos incómodos (The Uncomfortable Dead), co-authored with Subcomandante Marcos.

He is often attributed as one of the originators of the tai sabaki (whole body movement) method. He was known for his weapon skills including shuriken and tonfa. He was born on December 5, 1944 outside Hiroshima in Japan. He was raised by his grandparents in a small village called Nomicho. As a boy he was a restless soul and often got into fights. He first came into contact with Budo when he started training in Kendo at the age of 10 to get an outlet for his energy. In 1960, when he was 15 years old, he moved to Tokyo and started working at a petrol station. This was his working place for six years. In September 1961, he first entered a karate club. He saw karate practitioners train and spar hard and realistically, something he liked immediately. The club was Oyama Dojo, later the Kyokushinkai Honbu Dojo run by Masutatsu Oyama. He trained intensely and participated in every possible training session. His stubbornness and perseverance finally made it possible for him to grade to Shodan on March 26, 1964. He was then only 19 years old, and no one at the dojo could defeat him in kumite. In 1966, he was made instructor in Kyokushinkai Karate at the Honbu Dojo. He performed well, and it was decided that he would have the honour of travelling to Brazil to instruct and spread Kyokushinkai Karate, something he had dreamed of for years. Unfortunately it was not to be. He got into a fight and defeated five persons, who attacked him in the street. The police brought him into questioning, and the whole incident was reported to the Kyokushinkai Honbu Dojo. He was suspended from all training. After two months suspension he was pardoned and sent to Nomura on the island Shikoku in southern Japan. After three months he was called back to Tokyo and received a new chance to travel to Brazil. This time he declined. He wanted to return to Nomura and continue the work, he had started there. This was granted, and now his reputation as a fighter and instructor started to spread in that part of Japan. Nomura soon became too small, and he moved to the neighbouring city Yawatahama. He quickly founded one of the biggest Kyokushinkai clubs in Japan, and the activities were extended to two additional cities, Uwa and Uwajima. It was during this period that the concept of Sabaki was developed by him. Three principal points for Ashihara Karate was formed. Preparation, and the use of the four positions represented by the circular symbol of Ashihara Karate became the first point. The importance of timing and evaluation of distance (maai) became the second point. The third point is the stance, which must always be maintained whatever the situation to give maximum mobility. He continued to the city Matsuyama, and Ashihara Karate quickly became popular there as well. He started to instruct the police force, and universities started clubs in the area. Clubs were developed in Hiroshima, Osaka, Kyoto, Kobe, Nara, Shiga and other places. In March 1978, the construction of the Dojo in Matsuyama commenced and he moved there at the end of the year. In 1979, the building was completed. He was still associated with the Kyokushinkai organisation, but instructors in neighbouring districts were complaining about his expansion of clubs. To avoid conflict within Kyokushinkai, he choose to resign from actively practising Karate at an official meeting in Tokyo in March 1978. He announced that he was willing to give up leadership for the clubs, he had developed to concentrate on running his club in Matsuyama. It turned out that this was not enough, and he was expelled from Kyokushinkai shortly thereafter, following urge by competing instructors. It was with this background that he created the New International Karate Organisation (NIKO) - Ashihara Karate Kaikan in September 1980 based at his Dojo in Matsuyama and adopted the title Kancho (Grandmaster). In 1987 came the first signs of his illness. He had ALS a rare disease of the nervous system also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. In the beginning of the 1990s his condition worsened and he died on April 24, 1995 in Matsuyama, only 50 years old. Over 1000 people attended his funeral. Three autobiographies were written the first in 1981 \\"Sasurai Karate. Kagiri naki Charenji Supirittu\\", the second in 1986 \\"Karate ni moe karate ni ikiru\\" and the third \\"inochi no kotoba : Karate o aisuru hitobito e\\" translated is titled \\"The Word of life: For those who love Karate\\" was published after his death with the final chapter written by senior Honbu instructor Hiroshi Harada. Students include Joko Ninomiya, Kazuyoshi Ishii and Makoto Yoshida. Joko Ninomiya was a very successful tournament fighter (8th 1973 All-Japan, 3rd 1975 World Open, 2nd 1976 All-Japan and 1978 All-Japan champion) and would later go on to establish Enshin Karate in 1988. Ninomiya described him as his \\"first and only karate teacher\\". Kazuyoshi Ishii established the Seidokaikan karate style and later created the K-1 kickboxing competitions. Makoto Yoshida, who changed his name to Makoto Hirohara, was a successful tournament fighter (1987 Sabaki US Open Karate Challenge Heavyweight champion and again in 1988) and his student was the 1991 Middleweight Sabaki Challenge champion (Enshin karate). He established Shintaiikudo karate in 1995.

Clohessy has been widely quoted by news organizations covering the sex abuse scandal, including The New York Times, and he has appeared on numerous television shows, including Good Morning America, The Oprah Winfrey Show, The Phil Donahue Show, and 60 Minutes. Clohessy has publicly stated he was the victim of sexual abuse by priest Fr. John J. Whiteley during his teenage years (from 1969-1973). Clohessy struggled with the fact that his brother, Father Kevin Clohessy (who has since left the priesthood voluntarily), also had eventually \\"a credible accusation\\" against him for being inappropriate sexually while a priest. The allegation was never proven but in 2019, Kevin's name was posted on the diocese's list of 'credibly accused' clerics on its website. Clohessy is a 1978 graduate of Drury University in Springfield, Missouri. He has worked as a union organizer for the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now or ACORN, a public relations director and also served on the staff of St. Louis Mayor Freeman Bosley Jr. Recently, Clohessy has faced legal trouble for failing to release information on alleged clergy abuse victims. He has stated that he may be fined or jailed for failing to comply with the court order mandating him to release the records. The information was originally requested by the court because they believe an attorney for the plaintiff in a sexual abuse case violated a gag order by leaking details of the case to SNAP. The state Supreme Court has refused to intervene on his behalf, a decision that they made after his deposition. According to Clohessy, this is the most significant legal challenge faced by the group in its 23 years.

With a population of nearly 70,000, it is the second most populated municipality in Cyprus, after Limassol, and the most populated municipality of Nicosia District. It was established in 1986. Strovolos is now a town covering divided into six parishes: Chryseleousa, Ayios Demetrios, Apostolos Varnavas kai Ayios Makarios, Ayios Vasilios, National Martyr Kyprianos and Stavros. History The name Strovolos is said to originate from the Greek word \\"strovilos\\" (Στρόβιλος) as in \\"anemo-strovilos\\" which means whirlwind or twister. There are references to Strovolos or Strovilos as early as the Middle Ages from the well-known medieval chronicler Leontios Makhairas, and from Florius Boustronius a little later. According to these sources, Strovolos was a royal field during the years of Frankish Rule. A major and definitive figure in the history of Strovolos was the National Martyr, Archbishop Kyprianos, who before the 1821 Revolution in Greece, contributed greatly to the preservation of the Greek spirit and Christianity. The Turks hanged Archbishop Kyprianos and other high priests and dignitaries of Cyprus on 9 July 1821. Strovolos evolved into its present form after the events of 1974, when Turkey invaded Cyprus and occupied 38% of the island’s territory. This led to the settlement of many refugees within the Municipality. The Chryseleousa parish was named after the Greek orthodox church of the same name that was built around the 12th Century. = Former mayors = *1986–1996: Iosif Hadjiosif *1997–2012: Savvas Eliofotou *2012–2016: Dr Lazaros S.

Its size is for about 870 people including seats for people with special needs. This place has been designed with high standards. Particular attention has been paid to the study and implementation of the acoustic demands. Up to today the acoustic results have been proved to be very good according to the positive comments and the enthusiasm of the musical conductors, the soloists, and of the musicians who participated in several activities in the Hall. In 2014 the busts of Vasilis Michaelides and Demetris Lipertis, which had been placed outside the theater in 2013 were inaugurated at a ceremony which also celebrated El Greco. So a current photo in this article could update the existing one (this phrase should also change accordingly when the new photo is in place). The whole set of buildings has a big reception place which is connected with the reception place of the Municipal Building, modern and comfortable dressing rooms with hygienic places, a modern practice hall, a refreshment room for the artists, offices and storing places. It has all the equipment that is necessary for the successful organization and attendance of performances. For the development of athletics, an area for which the Municipality of Strovolos has a long tradition, the Municipality established the Municipal Athletic Center in which, among other facilities, includes four (4) futsal pitches, a mini football pitch, a running track and four (4) tennis courts. Environment In the area of Strovolos Municipality, 65 organized parks have been created as spaces for the entertainment of the citizens. More than 250 green places have been created, 340,000m² in total, while at the same time approximately 40,000 trees were planted in public areas, municipal parking lots and other areas. There are 32 organized green areas with amphitheatres, lakes, fountains and 65 playgrounds. The biggest and best parks are those of Acropolis and Ayios Demetrios which are one of a kind. Social policy and welfare The Municipality of Strovolos has also played a pioneer role in other areas such as social services, with the establishment of a club for the elderly in which specialized people offer their care to the elder people. Youth clubs for the recreation and education of primary children have also been established. In addition, the Municipality of Strovolos has established a Counseling Center that offers free services on issues of mental health, addictive substances, marriage, family, etc. The Center also organizes different activities for a financial support for those who suffer.

The comparatively short text of 32 folio-size pages (1126 lines) contains the history of the kings of Singhasari and Majapahit in eastern Java. Pararaton opens with a formal incarnation of the founder of Singhasari kingdom (1222–1292), Ken Arok (or Ken Angrok). Almost half of the manuscript is the story of Ken Arok's career before his accession to the throne in 1222. This part is clearly mythical in character. There then follow a number of shorter narrative fragments in chronological order. Many of the events recorded here are dated. Towards the end the pieces of history become shorter and shorter and are mixed with genealogical information concerning the members of the royal family of Majapahit. Since the oldest colophon in the manuscripts contains the date 1522 Saka (1600 CE), the final part of the text must have been written between 1481 and 1600 CE. Title This chronicle is most commonly known as the Pararaton, a title which does not appear in the body of the text, but only in the colophons of around half of the surviving manuscripts.Wayan Jarrah Sastrawan (2020) \\"How to read a chronicle: the Pararaton as a conglomerate text\\", Indonesia and the Malay World, pp. 4 The body of the text itself begins with the statement: \\"Thus follows the Story of Ken Angrok\\" (nihan katuturanira Ken Angrok), which indicates that this was the original title of the text or at least of its first part, which focusses on Ken Angrok's life. The edition of the text published by J.L.A. Brandes furnishes both alternative titles: Serat Pararaton atawa Katuturanira Ken Angrok (\\"The Book of Kings, or the Story of Ken Angrok\\"). The addition of serat, a Modern Javanese term for \\"book\\", seems have been an innovation by Brandes. It is inappropriate to refer to the Pararaton as a serat, because it does not belong to the Modern Javanese tradition in which serat are found. Furthermore, no manuscript of the Pararaton refers to the text as a serat. The most widely acceptable title for this text is thus simply the Pararaton. This term is clearly a nominal derivation from the stem ratu (\\"monarch\\"). In the Pararaton itself, the word ratu is completely gender-neutral, so it should be translated as \\"monarch\\" or \\"royal\\", rather than as \\"king\\". The analysis of the derivation from ratu to pararaton is not fully certain, but the morphology clearly denotes plurality. Thus the term pararaton can best be translated into English as The Monarchs or The Royals.  Prelude  Pararaton commences with a brief prelude telling how Ken Arok incarnated himself in which he became the king. He offered himself as a human sacrifice to Yamadipati, the Javanese Door God, in order to save himself from death. As a reward, he was promised that upon his death he would return to Vishnu's heaven and be reborn as a superior king of Singhasari. The promise was fulfilled. Ken Arok was begotten by Brahma of a newly-wed peasant woman. On his birth, his mother laid him in a graveyard where his body, effulgent with light, attracted the attention of Ki Lembong, a passing thief. Ki Lembong adopted him, raised him and taught him all of his arts. Ken Arok indulged in gambling, plunder and rapine. In the manuscript, it is written as such that Ken Arok was saved many times by divine intervention. There is a scene in Mount Kryar Lejar wherein gods descend in conference and Batara Guru (Shiva) declares Ken Arok his son. Ken Arok is also destined to bring stability and power to Java. The prelude of Pararaton is followed by the meeting of Ken Arok with Lohgawe, a Brahmin who came from India to make sure Batara Guru's instructions were fulfilled. It was Lohgawe who asked Ken Arok to meet Tunggul Ametung, ruler of Tumapel. Ken Arok then killed Tunggul Ametung to gain possession of Ametung's wife, Ken Dedes, and also the throne to Singashari.  Analysis of the manuscript  Some parts of Pararaton cannot be accounted as historical facts. Especially in the prelude, fact and fiction, fantasy and reality go together. Scholars such as C. C. Berg argued that texts such as these are entirely supernatural and ahistorical, and intended not to record the past, but instead determine future events. However, the majority of scholars accept some historicity in the Pararaton, noting numerous correspondences with other inscriptions and Chinese sources, and accept the manuscript's frame of reference within which a valid interpretation is conceivable. The manuscript was written under the nature of Javanese kingship. For Javanese, it is the function of the ruler to link the present with the past and the future and to give human life its appropriate place in the cosmic order. The king, in the Javanese realm, is the sacral embodiment of the total state, just as his palace is a microcosmic copy of the macrocosmos. The king (and a founder of a dynasty) possesses an innate divinity to a far higher degree than ordinary men. Ras compared the Pararaton with the Sanskrit Canggal inscription (732 CE), the Śivagŗha (Siwagrha) inscription (856 CE), the Calcutta Stone (1041 CE) and the Babad Tanah Jawi (1836 CE). These show clear similarities in character, structure and function and also similarity with texts from the Malay historiography.J.J. Ras, 2001, Sacral kingship in Java. In: Marijke J.

Mission parameters *Spacecraft: Soyuz 7K-ST *Mass: 6450 kg *Crew: None *Launched: 16 December 1979 *Landed: 25 March 1980 Mission highlights Four months had passed since the last Salyut 6 crew (Soyuz 32) had landed, and since the same amount of time had passed between the previous space station's long-duration crews, a December 1979 launch was considered a real possibility by observers. However, though the secretive Soviets did launch a craft that month, it was not what observers expected. Soyuz T-1 was launched 16 December, and was the fourth unmanned test flight of a modified version of the Soyuz spacecraft, the first to be given a \\"Soyuz\\" designation. Two days later, it approached the space station, but overshot it. A second dock attempt was made 19 December, and Soyuz T-1 successfully docked at the forward port. The Soyuz lifted the orbit of the space station on 25 December and remained docked to it for 95 days, during which time the station remained unoccupied. It undocked on 23 March 1980, performed several days of tests, then was de-orbited 25 March. The landing date was outside a normal landing window as the craft was being flight-rated over the standard two-and-a-half months and the Soviets were planning to launch Soyuz 35 during the next launch window in April. The mission was unusual for several reasons. Unlike other previous long unmanned missions, Soyuz T-1 was not powered down while docked to the space station. And, its recovery saw a change from the norm as well. Previous Soyuz missions saw the entire spacecraft de-orbit. But with the Soyuz T craft, the orbital module was separated prior to retro-fire, to save propellant. This allowed for more maneuvers prior to de-orbit.

In November, several European newspapers re-published the images, triggering more protests. Labour strikes began in Pakistan the following month, and several organizations criticized the Danish government. More protests occurred in January 2006, and later that month a boycott of Danish goods began. Comedian Omar Marzouk ridicules Muhammad as he defends freedom of speech. Several countries withdrew their ambassadors to Denmark, and widespread protests, some of them violent, began. The protests continued in February. In Damascus, Syria, both the Norwegian embassy and a building containing the Danish, Swedish, and Chilean embassies were stormed and set on fire by protesters. In Beirut, thousands of people protested on the streets, and the Danish General Consulate was stormed and set on fire. As of 2 March 2006, at least 139 people have died primarily during riots stemming from protests. On 1 January 2010, a man was shot whilst attempting to kill Kurt Westergaard, one of the original cartoonists. 2003 = April = Jyllands-Posten denied an unsolicited submission that caricatured the resurrection of Jesus, with the reason, that they were not funny, and would \\"offend some readers, not much but some\\". 2005 = September = *Flemming Rose, the cultural editor of Jyllands-Posten, commissions twelve cartoonists to draw cartoons of Islamic prophet Muhammad. This based upon a motivation explained as stemming from difficulties that Danish writer Kåre Bluitgen had trouble finding artists to illustrate his children's book about Muhammad. Artists in Denmark have been reluctant to provide these images due to a fear of assassinations by Islamists as journalist Troels Pedersen wrote in an article for the Danish news agency Ritzaus Bureau. 30 September *The cartoons are printed in the Danish daily newspaper, Jyllands-Posten, accompanied by an editorial text in Danish stating that Muslims are like any other and will have to put up with insults, mockery, and ridicule. = October = 14 October *Up to 5,000 people stage a peaceful demonstration outside the Copenhagen office of Jyllands- Posten. *Two of the cartoonists are advised to go into hiding after receiving death threats. 17 October *Egyptian newspaper El Fagr publishes six of the cartoons during Ramadan along with an article strongly denouncing them. The publication of the images does not provoke any known protests from either Egyptian religious authorities nor the Egyptian government. 19 October *Ambassadors from ten Muslim countries request a meeting with the Prime Minister of Denmark, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, to ask him to distance himself from the cartoons in Jyllands-Posten as well as various other allegedly derogatory comments about Islam in the Danish media.

It was later discovered that this was a considerable exaggeration, based on a small note in a local newspaper, citing Jamaat-e- Islami as promising a reward up to a million rupees for the deaths of the cartoonist. Jamaat-e-Islami claims to be wrongly cited, having merely suggested that the Pakistani government could promise such a reward. On its way through the Danish ambassador to the Danish media, this fact is exaggerated as involving multiple papers and flyers with the reward. 5 December *The first delegation of five Danish Imams, headed by Abu Bashar of The Community of Islam, landed in Egypt on 3 December 2005 and returned 11 December 2005. Among the people the group met on their visit to Egypt were: The General Secretary of the Arab League Amr Moussa, the Egyptian Grand Mufti Ali Gomaa, the Sheik of Cairo's Al-Azhar university Muhammad Sayid Tantawy and Muhammed Shaaban, an advisor to the Egyptian Foreign Minister.

Unlike the Danish People's Party Youth's drawings, this episode was not condoned by the youth movement, but was done by individuals. =October= 1 October *The national Norwegian TV-channel, TV2, airs a one-hour documentary about the printing of the Muhammad cartoons, the controversy and the aftermath of them.

Threats were also allegedly made towards Danish MP Naser Khader, who defended the publication of the cartoons. 2008 = February = 12 February * On 12 February 2008, Danish police arrested three men (two Tunisians and one Danish national originally from Morocco) suspected of planning to assassinate Kurt Westergaard, the cartoonist who drew the Bomb in the Turban cartoon. Shortly afterwards, the Dane was released without charge; the two Tunisians were not charged either, but expelled to Tunisia. Despite this, Westergaard has since been under police protection. He has said he is angry that a \\"perfectly normal everyday activity [drawing political cartoons] which I used to do by the thousand was abused to set off such madness.\\" The next day, 13 February 2008, Jyllands-Posten, and many other Danish newspapers including Politiken and Berlingske Tidende, reprinted Westergaard's Bomb in the Turban cartoon, as a statement of commitment to freedom of speech. The liberal newspaper Politiken had been critical of the original publication of the cartoons, but reprinted this one now as a gesture of solidarity in the face of a specific threat. In Denmark, some public disturbances with burnt-out cars and a school set ablaze followed these events, but the police are unsure if it is directly related to the cartoons controversy or the fact that the two Tunisians were subsequently sentenced to deportation without a trial. Other sources claim the riots in the Nørrebro district of Copenhagen, which started before the arrests, were wholly unrelated to the cartoons controversy, and were rather set off by police harassment of ethnic minorities in areas of Copenhagen. Some disturbances had occurred already in the days preceding the arrests. Peaceful demonstrations were held in Copenhagen after Friday prayers, with the flags of Hizb ut-Tahrir prominent. 13 February Several Danish newspapers, including Jyllands- Posten, reprints one of the cartoons as a response to the news of the arrest made the day before. 19 February Egypt banned editions of four foreign newspapers including the New York-based Wall Street Journal and Britain's The Observer for reprinting the controversial Danish cartoons criticizing Muhammad.Editor and Publisher article Egypt Bans Four Foreign Newspapers Over Republication of Anti-Prophet Cartoons published 19 February 2008 =March= 20 March A video allegedly from Osama Bin Laden threatens the EU over the reprinting of the cartoon. =June= 2 June  An attempt to blow up the Danish embassy in Islamabad.Blast rocks Danish embassy in high-security area Dawn.com =October= In October 2008, Ekstra Bladet published excerpts from an interview with Taliban spokesman Qari Yousuf AhmadiTaleban truer Danmark ekstrabladet.dk, 20 October 08.

News of the decision sparked criticism from some prominent Yale alumni as well as from the American Association of University Professors. Yale defended its rationale by saying it feared inciting violence if the images were published. Flemming Rose, the cultural editor who commissioned the cartoons, has described Yale's action as \\"[giving] in to intimidation... not even intimidation but an imagined intimidation\\".

Westergaard drew the best known of the cartoons, which depicted Muhammad with a bomb in his turban. The man was described as a 28-year-old Somali linked to the Islamist al-Shabab militia. He reportedly shouted in broken English that he wanted to kill Westergaard, who alerted police after locking himself into a panic room in the house, which was a specially fortified bathroom. Police said that the man was \\"armed with an axe and a knife in either hand\\", and broke down the entrance door of the house with the axe. The man attempted unsuccessfully to break down the door of the panic room while shouting swear words. He was shot in his right leg and left hand after reportedly throwing the axe at a police officer who arrived at the scene. Westergaard's five-year-old granddaughter was present in the living room of the house during the incident, but neither Westergaard nor his grandchild were harmed. Bomb disposal experts searched the home in order to ensure that a device had not been planted. The Somali man was carried into court on a stretcher to face two charges of attempted murder, which he denied. He was not named at the time of his arrest as the result of an injunction in the Danish courts. A spokesman for al-Shabab, Sheikh Ali Muhamud Rage, commented: \\"We appreciate the incident in which a Muslim Somali boy attacked the devil who abused our prophet Mohammed and we call upon all Muslims around the world to target the people like him.\\" On 4 February 2011, the attacker, named in court as Mohamed Geele, was sentenced to nine years in prison for attempting to commit an act of terrorism.

We apologize to anyone who was offended by our decision to reprint the cartoon drawing.\\" The apology prompted criticism from leading Danish politicians, among them prime minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen, who stated that \\"Politiken is bowing to other's views of our freedom of speech and this can lead to further attacks on Danish freedom of speech,\\" as well as the head of the Danish Union of Journalists, but Politiken has replied that the settlement did not mean that it had imposed on itself a ban on future publications of the drawings. =September= 8 September German Chancellor Angela Merkel honours cartoonist Kurt Westergaard.

Symptoms include a dry cough, shortness of breath, wheezing and feeling tired. These symptoms generally get worse over weeks to months. It is not related to cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, previously known as bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia. Causes include breathing in toxic fumes, respiratory infections, connective tissue disorder or complications following a bone marrow or heart-lung transplant. Symptoms may not occur until two to eight weeks following toxic exposure or infection. The underlying mechanism involves inflammation that results in scar tissue formation. Diagnosis is by CT scan, pulmonary function tests or lung biopsy. A chest X-ray is often normal. While the disease is not reversible, treatments can slow further worsening. This may include the use of corticosteroids or immunosuppressive medication. A lung transplant may be offered. Outcomes are often poor, with most people dying in months to years. Obliterative bronchiolitis is rare in the general population. It, however, affects about 75% of people by ten years following a lung transplant and up to 10% of people who have received a bone marrow transplant from someone else. The condition was first clearly described in 1981. Prior descriptions occurred as early as 1956, with the term \\"bronchiolitis obliterans\\" used first by Reynaud in 1835. Signs and symptoms Obliterative bronchiolitis results in worsening shortness of breath, wheezing, and a dry cough. The symptoms can start gradually, or severe symptoms can occur suddenly. These symptoms represent an obstructive pattern that is non-reversible with bronchodilator therapy, and need to be related to various lung insults. These insults include inhalation damage, post transplant auto-immune injury, post-infectious disease, drug reactions, and several auto-immune diseases. Cause Obliterative bronchiolitis has many possible causes, including collagen vascular disease, transplant rejection in organ transplant patients, viral infection (adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, HIV, cytomegalovirus), Stevens–Johnson syndrome, Pneumocystis pneumonia, drug reaction, aspiration and complications of prematurity (bronchopulmonary dysplasia), and exposure to toxic fumes, including diacetyl, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ammonia, chlorine, thionyl chloride, methyl isocyanate, hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen bromide, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen sulfide, phosgene, polyamide-amine dyes, mustard gas and ozone. It can also be present in patients with IBD, systemic lupus erythematosus, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, GERD, IgA nephropathy, and ataxia telangiectasia. Activated charcoal, have been known to cause it when aspirated. The ingestion of large doses of papaverine in the vegetable Sauropus androgynus has caused it. Additionally, the disorder may be idiopathic (without known cause). = Lung transplant = Obliterative bronchiolitis is a common complication in lung transplant, because transplanted lungs are at greater risk of alloimmunization as compared to healthy lungs. The disease is often termed bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) in the setting of post lung transplantation and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Patients who develop BOS post lung transplant vary in time frame and disease severity. Patients often initially have normal lung function on pulmonary function testing and have normal chest radiographs. As the disease progresses they begin to have symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and wheezing as their lung function declines. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation published updated guidelines in 2001 for grading the severity of BOS. The original guidelines and classification system were published in 1993 by the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation. Their scoring system is based on the changes in FEV1 in patients from their baseline. When patients are first diagnosed with BOS they have their baseline lung function established by doing pulmonary function testing at the time of diagnosis. The BOS scoring system is as follows: BOS 0: FEV1 > 90% of baseline and FEF25-75 > 75% of baseline BOS 0-p: FEV1 81-89% of baseline and/or FEF25-75 <= 75% of baseline BOS 1: FEV1 66-80% of baseline BOS 2: FEV1 51-65% of baseline BOS 3: FEV1 50% or less of baseline The scoring system shows an increased severity of the disease as the BOS number increases. = Hematopoietic stem cell transplant = Obliterative bronchiolitis affects up to 5.5% of people who have received HSCT. One of the biggest risk factors after HSCT is the development of GVHD with a 14% risk. Other risk factors post transplant including tobacco use, age of donor, age of recipient, lower baseline FEV1/FVC ratio, non-caucasian race, peripheral and lower circulating IgG levels. Studies have, however, shown mixed results regarding these other risk factors. There has been an association shown between the increased use of peripheral stem cells and the risk of developing obliterative bronchiolitis. Also, research has shown an increased risk for developing the disease within the first year of transplant if the person is infected with respiratory syncytial virus or parainfluenza virus within the first 100 days post transplant. =Inhalants= alt= There are many industrial inhalants that are known to cause various types of bronchiolitis, including obliterative bronchiolitis. Industrial workers who have presented with bronchiolitis: *nylon-flock workers *workers who spray prints onto textiles with polyamide- amine dyes *battery workers who are exposed to thionyl chloride fumes *workers at plants that use or manufacture flavorings such as diacetylCalifornia Department of Public Health Diacetyl is a chemical used to produce the artificial butter flavoring in many foods such as candy and microwave popcorn and occurring naturally in wines. This first came to public attention when eight former employees of the Gilster-Mary Lee popcorn plant in Jasper, Missouri developed obliterative bronchiolitis. Due to this event, obliterative bronchiolitis began to be referred to in the popular media as \\"popcorn lung\\" or \\"popcorn workers lung\\". It is also referred to as \\"flavorings-related lung disease\\". = Post-infectious = High resolution CT scan of a child with post-infectious obliterative bronchiolitis showing glass pattern with air trapping and bronchial thickening Typically found in young children and is the most common cause at this age. Generally occurs after a viral infection of adenovirus (types 3, 7, and 21), measles (rubeola), mycoplasma, CMV, influenza, and parainfluenza. Swyer-James syndrome is a rare complication of obliterative bronchiolitis caused by measles or adenovirus. Post-infectious obliterative bronchiolitis is most common in the southern hemisphere particularly in countries such as Brazil, Argentina, Australia, Chile and New Zealand. There was a large prevalence of the disease in these areas during the 1990s and early 2000s. In one hospital in Buenos Aires, the Ricardo Gutiérrez Children's hospital, the disease accounted for 14% of their inpatient respiratory population from 1993 to 2002. As such, much of the information about post-infectious obliterative bronchiolitis has come from research out of South America. The most significant risk factors for the disease are infection with adenovirus and the need for ventilator support. In contrast with another cause of obliterative bronchiolitis in children, Steven's Johnson's syndrome, post-infectious obliterative bronchiolitis tends to be a chronic but non- progressive disease. The disease can have varying impact on children and their quality of life, which has been studied by lung function tests, as well as their exercise tolerance. Children with lower lung function based on their pulmonary function testing, have lower exercise tolerance, which compounds the impact of the disease on cardiovascular function as they are not able to maintain age appropriate aerobic fitness. This ultimately affects their activities of daily living (ADLs) and their quality of life going forward. =Burn pits= A form of constrictive bronchiolitis is starting to present in Iraq and Afghanistan veterans. It has been attributed to veterans being exposed to trash burn pits. Veterans present with shortness of breath and other asthma-like symptoms. The only way to diagnose this condition is by doing a lung biopsy as chest X-rays and CT scans come back as normal. The government still denies that there is any correlation between burn pits and health problems but the government has started an \\"Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry\\" to begin tracking the health of veterans who were exposed to burn pits to see if there is a connection.http://www.usmedicine.com/compendium/where-theres-smoke-dod- investigates-causes-of-deployment-related-pulmonary-symptoms-reported-by- troops.html#.UsH-jNJDvSs =E-cigarettes= The American Lung Association lists flavored e-cigarettes as a risk in 2016. Health Canada has, however seen no cases as of 2019. Public Health England writes that the association has come about as \\"some flavourings used in e-liquids to provide a buttery flavour contain the chemical diacetyl... however, diacetyl is banned as an ingredient from e-cigarettes and e-liquids in the UK.\\" Mechanism The underlying mechanism involves injury and inflammation of epithelial and sub-epithelial cells. These cells then lose the ability to repair the tissue, in particular they lose the ability to regenerate the epithelial or outermost layer, leading to the excess growth of cells that cause scarring. There are multiple pathways of the disease including fibrotic, lymphocytic, and antibody-mediated that have been described. However, while each pathway has a more unique starting point and cause, the end result is still injury and inflammation leading to scarring of the lung tissue. The scarred tissue then makes the expiration phase of respiration more difficult, leading to air not being expelled from the lungs. This is termed \\"air-trapping\\", which can be seen on medical imaging. Since the scarring is non-reversible, the disease generally does not improve over time, and depending on the inciting can progress to death. Diagnosis Example of early disease with mild flattening of the diaphragm Obliterative bronchiolitis involving the terminal airways Obliterative bronchiolitis is often diagnosed based on the symptoms of obstructive lung disease following lung injury. The definitive diagnosis is through biopsy, but due to the variable distribution of lesions, leading to falsely negative tests, and invasive nature of this procedure it is often not performed. Several tests are often needed to diagnose obliterative bronchiolitis, including spirometry, diffusing capacity of the lung tests (DLCO), lung volume tests, chest X-rays, high-resolution CT (HRCT), and lung biopsy. = Pulmonary function testing = Spirometry tests usually show an obstructive pattern and is the most common presentation. A slightly reduced to normal forced vital capacity (FVC), and a reduced FEV1 to FVC ratio and forced expiratory volume (FEV) with little to no correction with the use of bronchodialators are common findings. Lung volume tests may show hyperinflation (excessive air in lungs caused by air trapping). Diffusing capacity of the lung (DLCO) tests are usually normal; people with early-stage OB are more likely to have normal DLCO. FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) should be above 80% of predicted values to be considered normal. Obliterative bronchiolitis reduces this to between 16% and 21%. = Medical imaging = Early in the disease chest radiography is typically normal but may show hyperinflation. As the disease progresses a reticular pattern with thickening of airway walls may be present. HRCT can also show air trapping when the person being scanned breathes out completely; it can also show thickening in the airway and haziness in the lungs. A common finding on HRCT is patchy areas of decreased lung density, signifying reduced vascular caliber and air trapping. This pattern is often described as a \\"mosaic pattern\\", and may indicate obliterative bronchiolitis. = Lung biopsy = Transthoracic lung biopsies are preferable for diagnosis of constrictive BO compared to transbronchial biopsies; regardless of the type of biopsy, a diagnosis may only be achieved by examination of multiple samples. Transthoracic biopsies are preferred over transbronchial due to the heterogeneity and distribution of the lesions. OB can be further classified into two categories: constrictive or proliferative. The constrictive pattern is demonstrated by peribronchiolar cellular infiltrates which eventually causes small airway damage and leads to subepithelial fibrosis. The bronchial muscle can eventually become fibrosed which can be identified with trichrome staining. In regards to proliferative disease, intraluminal buds called \\"Masson bodies\\" fill the lumen, which results in bronchiolar plugging. Often people with proliferative disease will show butterfly wing-like appearance under microscopy. One key determinate that can be seen on biopsy to differentiate constrictive from proliferative disease is the extent of lesions. Both lesions are localized from the small bronchi to the membranous bronchi, but in constrictive disease the lesions are intermittent while proliferative disease has a continuous distribution. = Differential diagnosis = Other conditions that can present similarly include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, bronchiectasis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and pneumonia.  Prevention  = Inhalants = Disease caused by exposure to industrial inhalants and burn pits can be prevented with the use of engineering controls (e.g., exhaust hoods or closed systems), personal protective equipment, monitoring of potentially affected personnel, worker education and training. = Transplant = The primary prevention of obliterative bronchiolitis in people who have received either lung transplant or HSCT therapy is immunosuppression. In regards to post lung transplantion, the combination of calcineurin inhibitor combined with a purine synethesis inhibitor and a glucocorticoid is the general regimen used. People also have a baseline post-transplant lung function testing done in order to determine over time if their lung function is declining. People who are post HSCT their immunosuppressive regimen typically includes methotrexate in combination with a calcineurin inhibitor to prevent GVHD, a risk factor for developing obliterative bronchiolitis. Treatment While the disease is not reversible, treatments can slow further worsening. This may include the use of corticosteroids or immunosuppressive medication which may have an effect on the ability to receive a lung transplant if offered. If patients have difficulty breathing (hypoxemia) oxygen can be supplemented. Routine vaccinations are recommended for patients with chronic lung disease to prevent complications from secondary infections due to pneumonia and influenza. Transplant recipients are at risk for re-developing the disease, as obliterative bronchiolitis is a form of chronic rejection. Evaluation of interventions to prevent obliterative bronchiolitis relies on early detection of abnormal spirometry results or unusual decreases in repeated measurements. Terminology \\"Bronchiolitis obliterans\\" was originally a term used by pathologists to describe two patterns of airway disease. One was bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), also known as cryptogenic pneumonia, and the other is now known as obliterative bronchiolitis. The name cryptogenic obliterative (constrictive) bronchiolitis is used when a cause is unknown. Obliterative bronchiolitis is also not to be confused with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). BOS is defined as a person who has had either a HSCT or lung transplant and develops symptoms or radiographic findings consistent with bronchiolitis obliterans, but has not been confirmed by biopsy.

It is the first in Cordell's \\"Mortymer Trilogy\\", followed by The Hosts Of Rebecca (1960) and Song of the Earth (1969).Stephens, Meic (1986). The Oxford Companion to the Literature of Wales. OUP. The book has been translated into seventeen languages. In addition to the book having been adapted for numerous plays over the years and more recently. There also exist audio versions of the book in circulation read by Philip Madoc and there have been successive attempts to get the book made into a film. Cordell's style and subject matter are reminiscent of Richard Llewellyn's How Green Was My Valley. Plot summary The plot concerns the Welsh iron-making communities of Blaenavon and Nantyglo in the 19th century. The action is seen through the eyes of young Iestyn Mortymer who grows up in times of growing tensions between ironmasters and Trade Unionists. In 1826, when the book starts, Iestyn is eight years old and already beginning work at the Garndyrus furnaces near Blaenavon. His sister Morfydd has strong feelings about women and children working in mines and ironworks. She sympathises with the Chartist movement and condemns the action of the militant Scotch Cattle. In this she is in opposition to Hywel Mortymer, their conservative father who later begins to question his own loyalty to the ironmaster. Story Cordell's first successful novel draws the hardship of life in early industrial Wales with the father starting off as positive towards the English coal and iron masters of the time but then on seeing his family and neighbours suffer (and sometimes die) he revolts with his son, Iestyn to protest. The family life leads to the fight for trade unions and Chartism. The historical background against which the novel is set is described in considerable detail with profoundly researched factual events like the 1839 Newport Rising show this book to be worthy of the bestseller status it achieved in the UK as well as the USA. Cordell told of the story of the Chartist movement starting in Wales accurately and clearly like no other, but with a background of humanity of the Mortymer family.

But no salmon leap in the river now, for it is black with furnace washings and slag, and the great silver fish have been beaten back to the sea or gasped out of their lives on sands of coal. No alders stand now for they have been chopped as fuel for the cold blast. Even the mountains are shells, groaning in their hollows of emptiness, trembling to the arrows of the pit-props in their sides, bellowing down the old workings that collapse in unseen dust five hundred feet below. Plundered is my country, violated, raped.\\" \\"The pot that had simmered for fifty years boiled over. Colliers and miners, furnacemen and tram-road labourers were flooding down the valley to the Chartists' rendezvous: men from Dowlais under the Guests, Cyfarthfa under the Crawshays, Nantyglo under Bailey and a thousand forges and bloomeries in the hills: men of the farming Welsh, the Staffordshire specialists and the labouring Irish were taking to arms.\\" Bibliography External links *Cordell Country - a look at the landscape the book was based around *Review in Clarion - covers both the book and a recent theatre adaptation Category:1959 British novels Category:Anglo-Welsh novels Category:Novels set in Wales Category:Torfaen Category:Blaenau Gwent Category:Ethically disputed working conditions Category:Books about labour Category:Victor Gollancz Ltd books Category:Doubleday (publisher) books Category:Novels by Alexander Cordell Category:Blaenavon ","title":"Rape of the Fair Country"},{"id":"3935483","text":"AN/APG-77 in the National Electronics Museum The AN/APG-77 is a multifunction low probability of intercept radar installed on the F-22 Raptor fighter aircraft.

Shelton, 535 U.S. 654 (2002), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court upheld the Alabama Supreme Court's ruling that counsel (a lawyer) must be provided for the accused in order to impose a suspended prison sentence.  Background  Shelton was accused of third-degree assault, which, in Alabama, is a misdemeanor and carries a maximum sentence of one year in prison and a $2,000 fine. The court repeatedly warned Shelton of the dangers of representing himself during the trial, yet failed to offer him counsel. He represented himself both in the local court, where he was convicted, and the Alabama Circuit Court, where he was also convicted. However, the Circuit Court gave Shelton a 30-day suspended sentence and 2 years' probation. The Criminal Court of Appeals found that it was not compulsory to offer the defendant counsel for a suspended sentence because the sentence did not result in actual confinement. The Supreme Court of Alabama stated that: (1) a defendant may not be sentenced to a term of imprisonment absent provision of counsel; and (2) for purposes of this rule, a suspended sentence constitutes a \\"term of imprisonment,\\" even though incarceration is not immediate or inevitable.

Rowland Ellis becomes a Quaker as a result of the influence of a neighbour, but his wife does not share his religious beliefs. Following her death, he marries a sympathetic cousin. He is betrayed to the authorities by a servant he has dismissed, who describes a \\"secret room\\" he claims to have seen in the house, containing objects of Catholic worship.

He amassed Primeira Liga totals of 295 games and 88 goals over the course of 14 seasons, in representation of Olhanense and Sporting da Covilhã. Subsequently, he went on to have a coaching career that lasted more than two decades, and included spells with Benfica and the Portugal national team. Playing career Born in Lagos, Algarve, Cabrita played 14 of his 18 years as a senior in his country's top division, starting out at S.C. Olhanense. In the 1943–44 season, he scored a career-best 20 goals in only 18 games to help his team to the fifth position out of ten clubs. Cabrita also represented Angers SCO (France, second level), S.C. Covilhã and Portimonense S.C. before retiring in 1960 at the age of 37. He gained seven caps for Portugal in twelve years, making his debut on 11 March 1945 in a 2–2 friendly draw against Spain and netting his only goal in his next appearance, a 1–5 away loss to the same opponent for the 1950 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, on 2 April 1950. Managerial career Cabrita started working as a coach as he was still playing with Portimonense, in 1959. His first full-time stop at the professional level came during the 1967–68 campaign, when he acted as interim at S.L. Benfica and led the club to the national championship, before Otto Glória took over. In the Portuguese top flight he was also in charge of U.F.C.I. Tomar, S.C. Beira-Mar, Rio Ave FC, Académico de Viseu FC and F.C. Penafiel. Cabrita served as Portugal's manager during nine matches starting in 1983, after the resignation of Glória. He led a technical commission with three other members – José Augusto, António Morais and Toni – and coached the national side to the semi-finals at UEFA Euro 1984, where they lost 2–3 to France in extra time.

The municipality has a population of 20,783 (2011) and is contiguous with Nicosia Municipality. Aglandjia is near the buffer zone. It has an area of about 31 km2, of which 14 km2 are agricultural land occupied by the Turkish army since 1974. Of the remaining 17 km2, 9 km2 are national forest parks (Athalassa park, 8.6 km2 and Pedagogical Academy park 0.4 km2). Name The word Aglandjia is of Turkish origin, deriving from , meaning \\"entertainment\\". Its pronunciation in Cypriot Greek is . Another theory states that the name derives from the surname of the Frankish family de Aglande who owned the area in the period of Frankish rule during the Middle Ages. Geography Aglandjia is Nicosia's highest suburb, since its largest part is built either on hills or at tableland level. Aglandjia was built in mediaeval times, before Ottoman rule, on an important site for defensive purposes, which also offered natural resources and a healthy climate. Aglandjia contains many green spaces. The largest is the \\"big lung\\" of Nicosia, Athalassa Forest, but the municipality also offers Ayios Yeorgios Park, Aglandjia Municipal Park, and 45 small parks and green spaces. Aglandjia is built along the road that led from Nicosia to Larnaca before the invasion. Two trapezoidal hills overlook the road on both sides. The hill on the north is Arona hill, which is now under Turkish occupation. The hill on the south is called Aronas of Athalassa or Mount Lion or Liontarovounos. Demography Aglandjia has a population of 22,000 inhabitants, of whom 7,500 are refugees. It maintains a nucleus with traditional brick houses with yards and narrow streets, surrounded by more recently constructed houses, blocks of flats, and refugee housing. Administration A street in Aglandjia Aglandjia was declared a Municipality by a referendum in May 1986. The Municipal Council is made up of the Mayor and sixteen Municipal Councilors. The current Mayor is Charalambos Petrides.Aglandjia Municipality employs 24 permanent employees and 30 workers (permanent and casual) who staff the services below, which have their seat in the Town Hall: * Secretariat * Technical services * Financial services * Greenery and Environment services * Hygiene services * Cultural services Sites of Interest Two television broadcasting stations, the state station CyBC, are based in Aglandjia. The Police Headquarters and the Agriculture Research Institute, the Veterinary Clinic offers, the International Conference Centre, the Higher Technological Institute, and the Higher Hotel Institute are also located in Aglandjia. Previously, the Pedagogical Academy was also based in Aglandjia, but the University of Cyprus now occupies the building; the new campus of the University is also located in Aglandjia. The Melkonian Educational Institute operated in Aglandjian between 1926 and 2005. Aglandjia is also home to several churches and chapels. Ayios Yeorgios church stands in the heart of Aglandjia. Apostle Andreas church was built on the initiative of refugees. Ayios Nektarios church, Ayios Yeorgios Athalassa chapel, and the country churches of Panayia, Ayios Yeorgios and Ayia Mavri are all located in Aglandjia. The municipality has six elementary schools and three secondary schools. The Skali Cultural Center is also located in the municipality. History A park in Aglandjia The history of Aglandjia goes back as far as 3888 BC. Several tombs dating to the Bronze Age have been found on Arona hill (Mount Lion or Liontarovounos). The hill is strategically located for the defense of the area, so the settlement there was most likely a military deployment during the first phase of its history. Around the hill there was an ancient settlement, from which the city of Ledra may have originated. Important archaeological works of art and inscriptions in the Cypriot syllabary have been found in Kafizin or Small Aronas, a historic site with a cave dedicated to the worship of a Nymph. These objects indicate the site was in use as a place of worship during the Hellenistic period, specifically between 225 and 218 BC, during the reigns of Ptolemy the Benefactor and Ptolemy Philopatoras. A variety of unique, locally manufactured pottery was also found at the site, including various bowls, two-handled vessels, cup-bearers, feeding bottles, mud-lighters, jars, cooking utensils, frying pans, wash basins, jugs, combined pots, urns, amphorae, rhytons, large jars and jar lids, and objects testifying to the practice of weaving. In the Middle Ages, the Lefkomiatis settlement was in the area of Aglandjia. The area seems to have been inhabited towards the end of Frankish rule, during the reign of Jacques II (1468–1473). The medieval La Cava castle, built on Arona hill around 1385 by King Jacques I, was used as an observatory for the control of the road leading from Larnaca to Nicosia.The castle took its name from the large rock cistern which still survives today. The castle was blasted by the Venetians during the third decade of the 16th century, while the Ottomans used the bigger of its two towers as a powder magazine. Up until 1870 a considerable amount of the Castle was still standing, including the vaulted hall, the curtain walls, and two towers. However, the majority of the Castle was pulled down in that year to build the Church of Phaneromeni. In 1888 the area was excavated by a Mr M R James. The Castle was proclaimed an ancient moment in 1915.Rupert Gunnis, Historic Cyprus, 1936 Today a portion of the Great Tower and Second Tower exists together with the cistern.Touring Guide of Nicosia 1994 After the conquest of Cyprus by the Ottomans, the Aglandjia settlement declined. It started to form a self-sufficient rural settlement around the end of the 18th century whose inhabitants engaged in farming, stockbreeding, and quarrying. Around the end of the 18th century, dragoman Hadjigeorgakis Kornesios erected Ayios Yeoryios church on the site of the cemetery and Ayios Yeoryios church in Athalassa. Aglandjia contributed organized groups to the EOKA struggle, and local volunteers also participated in the events of 1964. During the Turkish invasion of 1974, Aglandjia was bombed. The Turkish army continues to occupy 45% of the municipality's territory.

Rather than having its spokes mortised into a wooden nave (hub), it has them fitted together in a keystone fashion with miter joints, bolted into a two-piece metal nave. Its tyre is shrunk onto the rim in the usual way but it may also be bolted on for security. The design evolved over the nineteenth and early twentieth century, and was ultimately imitated in drawn steel for auto wheels which sometimes show little immediate resemblance to most of their design ancestry. Wood artillery wheels Armstrong gun with artillery wheels Wheels with wood spokes fitted together in a keystone fashion with miter joints, bolted into a two-piece metal nave, were called \\"wedge wheels\\" by Walter Hancock who described them in 1834, as he used them on his steam-powered road vehicles. In response to Hancock's description, John Robison said he had wheels of the same description built in 1811 for artillery carriages, and that \\"A construction very analogous to this has long been in use in the Madras Artillery; in which service I have always understood that it gave every satisfaction.\\" The 1917 standard 209-pound 56-inch artillery wheel of the US Army, for horse-drawn guns. This wheel design that came be called artillery wheels was extensively used with artillery. For example, this type of wheel was used on the pictured Armstrong gun, used in Japan in 1868. A similar design was used for a gun carriage for the US Army's 3.2 inch gun in 1881, with a wheel diameter of , based on testing of an Archibald Wheel Company design. By 1917, the 14-spoke wheel evolved to have 16 spokes, high-carbon-steel tires, felloes (8 sawed or 2 bent), improved spoke shoes, and 0.25 inch per foot (21 mm per meter) dishing, to arrive at the \\"standard\\" wheel pictured. For motor-drawn guns, the wheel further evolved, primarily to smaller diameters to accommodate solid rubber tires. Motor vehicles Artillery wheel for a motorcar Wood-spoke artillery wheels were used on early automobiles, as a stronger alternative to wire wheels. By the 1920s, many motor cars used wheels that looked at a glance like wooden artillery wheels but which were of cast steel or welded from steel pressed sections. These too were usually called artillery wheels. Whether wood, pressed steel, or wire wheels were preferred varied greatly in different markets. =British cars= Joseph Sankey and Sons developed and patented the first pressed-steel and welded detachable motor car wheel. Production started in 1908, with customers including Herbert Austin and, later, William Morris. By 1920, Sankey were supplying wheels to many UK manufacturers. Though Sankey did not market their steel wheels as artillery wheels, the term Sankey wheels was used interchangeably with steel artillery wheels by 1930. Sankey belatedly, circa 1935, publicly recognized the connection of their steel wheels to artillery wheels. =US cars= In the 1930s, US manufacturers, whose markets often preferred wheels of substantial appearance, moved to stamped steel wheels which imitated large-hub artillery wheels. Ford Motor Company adopted this in 1935, Chevrolet brought out its now iconic wheel in 1936. These wheels were based on large-hub wheels, and do not superficially resemble most small-hub wood wheels.

It is an important commercial center on the Brasília-Salvador highway. Location Alvorada do Norte is part of the Vão do Paranã Microregion. Neighboring municipalities are Iaciara, Posse, Simolândia, Buritinópolis, Sítio d'Abadia, Damianópolis, and Flores de Goiás. The distance to Goiânia is 457 km. and highway connections are made by BR-153 / Anápolis / BR-060 / Alexânia / Planaltina / Formosa / BR-020. Brasília is 250 km. away.Anuario de Transporte History The town of Alvorada do Norte appeared in 1958, created by the authorities of the town of Sítio d'Abadia. They knew that the valley of the Paranã River would be the future route of the new federal highway BR-020 and that it would link the Brazilian Northeast to the new capital of Brasília, so they founded a new town on the edge of the future highway. A curious fact is that Hermeliano Alves de Brito, who had been mayor of Sítio D’Abadia, was behind the move since his candidate had lost the election in Sítio. He had the complete support of Mauro Borges, state governor at the time. As late as 1976, Alvorada was quite isolated from the rest of the country. The small town lived off of the hardwoods extracted from the abundant forests nearby. From Alvorada to Formosa there was not even any asphalt and there was neither television nor telephone. Located on the banks of the Rio Corrente, it is an obligatory stop for all those travelling between the states of the north and the south. People came from all around to start shops or to look for work. Soon other economic activities began such as rice, bean, corn, and manioc cultivation, taking advantage of the fertile soils. Cattle raising did not take long to become an important part of the economy. Nearby is Itiquira or (Itiquirinha) waterfall, with a height of 70 meters. Curiously the name Itiquira is the same as the much higher waterfall in the municipality of Formosa. Economy The economy is mainly dependent on agriculture and services. Main agricultural activities (2006) were cattle raising and agriculture (corn and soybeans). In 2007 there were 93 retail units and three banks—Banco do Brasil S.A, BRADESCO S.A., and Banco Itaú S.A. The main employer in the town was commerce and then small transformation industries (furniture making, wood processing, cereal transforming). Agriculture was the largest source of employment with 1,150 persons dependent on this livelihood.IBGE and Sepin Motor vehicles in 2006 *Automobiles: 670 *Pickup trucks: 122 *Trucks: 103 *Buses: 4 *Motorcycle: 336 *Number of inhabitants per automobile and pickup truck: 10.37 Agricultural data 2006 *Farms: 298 *Total area: 65,952 ha. *Area of permanent crops: 124 ha. *Area of perennial crops: 1,741 ha. *Area of pasture: 44,388 ha. *Area of woodland and forests: 14,303 ha. *Cattle herd: 34,523 head Health and education *Infant mortality rate in 2000: 36.25 *Hospitals: 01 with 30 beds (2006) *Literacy rate in 2000: 80.5% *Schools: 14 with 3,244 students Alvorada do Norte is ranked 218 out of 242 municipalities in the state of Goiás on the United Nations 2000 Human Development Index with a score of 0.688.

The book begins with a preface explaining the term quotation. The dictionary has been compiled from extensive evidence of the quotations that are actually used in the way they have been listed. This book is not—like many quotations dictionaries—a subjective anthology of the editor's favourite quotations, but an objective selection of the quotations which are most widely known and used. Popularity and familiarity are the main criteria for inclusion, although no reader is likely to be familiar with all the quotations in this dictionary. The quotations are drawn from novels, plays, poems, essays, speeches, films radio and television broadcasts, songs, advertisements, and even book titles. It is difficult to draw the line between quotations and similar sayings like proverbs, catch-phrases, and idioms. For example, some quotations (like “The opera ain’t over till the fat lady sings”) become proverbial. These are usually included if they can be traced to a particular originator. Catch-phrases are included if there is evidence that they are widely remembered or used. Quotations are also cross-referenced. For example, on looking up Napoleon's quotation about Britain being a nation of shopkeepers, one also finds Adam Smith, who said it first. Quotations about absolute power are cross-referenced to Lord Acton, and from him to William Pitt the Elder, who said something similar. The dictionary has been jokingly called the Oxford Dikker of Quotaggers using the Oxford \\"-er\\". The first edition in 1941 was compiled by a committee drawn from the staff of the OUP under the editorship of Alice Mary Smyth (later Alice Mary Hadfield).Smith, Preface She recounts some of the details of choosing and processing quotations in her book on the life of Charles Williams (one of the committee).Hadfield, p. 114-115 Later editions of the Dictionary were published in 1953 and thereafter, the 6th edition appearing in 2004 (), the 7th in 2009 (), and the 8th in 2014 (), all edited by Elizabeth Knowles.

He typically plays as left-back, but occasionally acts as a midfielder. Career =Tranmere Rovers= Neil Ashton started his career with Tranmere Rovers as a youth player in 2001 and turned professional in 2003, he was part of the senior squad until 2005 making just one league appearance during his time at Prenton Park. In the 2004–05 season he was loaned out to Shrewsbury Town and made 24 appearances. =Shrewsbury Town= At the start of the 2004–05 season, the manager at that time, Gary Peters, bought in Ashton on loan from Tranmere Rovers to offer competition to left back Trevor Challis. By the end of that season, the deal was turned into a permanent one that saw Ashton make over 130 appearances in all competitions, before his subsequent move to Macclesfield Town. In January 2008, Ashton joined Macclesfield Town on loan for the rest of the 2007–2008 campaign in a bid to find first team football.http://www.shropshirestar.com/news/2008/01/11/ashton-to-benefit-from- loan-switch/ Ashton made 19 appearances, scoring once in his spell with Macclesfield. =Chester City= In the summer of 2009 Ashton signed for Chester City who had recently been relegated to the Conference Premier. However, he was left without a club on 26 February 2010 after Chester were expelled from the Football Conference after breaching five league regulations, then wound up. =Wrexham= After the demise of Chester, Ashton joined the club's fierce rivals Wrexham on trial playing twice for the reserves, impressing then manager Dean Saunders. He signed for the Conference club ahead of the 2010–2011 campaign. He took the number 3 shirt and was a regular in the side and in his first season with the Dragons Ashton made 42 appearances including playing in both legs of the defeats to Luton Town in the Conference Play-off semi-finals. In the 2011–12 season, Ashton was part of the Wrexham side that finished second in the league gaining 98 points, but like the previous season they lost in the play-off semi finals to Luton Town. However, as a consolation to Ashton, he earned the club's player of the year award for the season after making 48 appearances including an FA Cup 3rd round match against Brighton & Hove Albion when they lost on penalties after a replay. He scored his first goal for Wrexham from the penalty spot, making it a 5–1 win against Braintree Town in what was virtually the last kick of the regular season. In the 2012–13 season, Ashton stayed at the Racecourse and was still a regular in the Dragons defence. After the departure of regular penalty taker Jake Speight to Mansfield Town Ashton took over penalty duties scoring his first in a 2–1 loss to Blackpool in a pre-season match. He scored his first goals of the season in a game away to Stockport County with two penalties but due to \\"over celebrating\\" he picked up a second yellow card and was sent off. On 6 November 2012 Ashton signed a new 3-year contract with Wrexham which would last until 2015. His next goal came in a 4–2 FA Cup first round loss to Alfreton Town. On 8 December 2012 Ashton scored his first goal in open play against Nuneaton Town before scoring a second in the match from the penalty spot in a memorable 6–1 win. In March 2013 Ashton picked up his first career honour by winning the FA Trophy with Wrexham, Ashton played in every round but missed the final at Wembley due to injury. A month and a half later, Ashton played at Wembley in a Wrexham shirt, in a 2–0 loss to Newport County in the Conference play-off Final.

Robida (June 13, 1987 – February 5, 2006) was an American neo-Nazi and murderer. Robida attacked three patrons at a gay bar in New Bedford, Massachusetts on February 2, 2006 before fleeing by vehicle to Charleston, West Virginia, where he picked up passenger Jennifer Rena Bailey and drove southwest. He was stopped for a traffic violation by Gassville, Arkansas police officer James W. Sell, whom Robida shot and killed before fleeing east. Robida lost control of his vehicle in Norfork, Arkansas shortly after running over a spike strip laid by police. He then engaged in a firefight with police, during which he fatally shot Bailey and then shot himself in the head. Robida died in a hospital in Springfield, Missouri at 03:38 CST on February 5, 2006. Attack Puzzles Lounge About midnight on February 2, 2006, Robida entered Puzzles Lounge, a popular gay bar in New Bedford, Massachusetts, south of Boston. The 18-year-old, dressed in black, proceeded to order a drink using a fake ID indicating he was 23. After downing his first drink, he asked the bartender if the lounge was a gay bar. The bartender confirmed it was. After a second drink Robida then swung a hatchet at a patron's head, injuring him. Other patrons tackled him and relieved him of the weapon, whereupon Robida produced a handgun and began shooting, wounding at least three more people. Police treated the incident as a hate crime, and Robida was sought by police for three counts of attempted murder. Robida fled the scene in a green 1999 Pontiac Grand Am to Charleston, West Virginia, where he was joined by Jennifer Rena Bailey and drove southwest. It has been reported that Robida lived with Bailey in West Virginia in 2004. It is unclear whether Bailey joined him willingly or if she was abducted. Manhunt and capture Police immediately began a manhunt for Robida and raided his mother's home in New Bedford. She told them she had last seen him at 1am bleeding from the head and that he had left soon after. They found weapons of all types, including hatchets, knives, handguns and a shotgun. In his bedroom they found \\"Nazi regalia\\" and anti- Semitic writings on the walls. Fearing he may have left Massachusetts, state police contacted the FBI, sparking a nationwide manhunt. Before long, flyers depicting Robida were distributed all over Massachusetts. In the afternoon of February 4, 2006, Robida's vehicle was seen about away in Arkansas, where Jim Sell, a Gassville police officer, initiated a traffic stop at the Brass Door Restaurant parking lot. After talking with Sell for about half a minute, Robida opened fire with a 9mm handgun, killing the officer. He turned onto Arkansas Highway 201 headed south and continued to Arkana, Arkansas, where he fired at Arkansas State Police Sgt. Van Nowlin. Police pursued him and laid spike strips; although these flattened his front tires, they failed to stop the car. Robida fled for about 18 miles down Arkansas Highway 5, where he turned south and drove into the small town of Norfork. In the middle of town he lost control of the car due to the front tires, spun out, and hit two parked vehicles. He then exchanged gunfire with police. During the gunfight, he shot Bailey in the head at point blank range with a Ruger 9mm semi- automatic pistol, killing her instantly. After Bailey's death, Robida shot himself in the right side of the head. He was flown more than 100 miles to Springfield, Missouri for medical treatment, where he died of his injuries the next day, on February 5.  Responses to the attack  At first the mayor of New Bedford, Scott Lang, attributed the attack in part to video games: > This was a hate crime... the actions of a single deranged individual act as > a wake up call to our community and once again the nation... This cycle of > violence must stop. The guns have to come off the streets. The violent video > games have to be taken out of our homes. Believing the mayor was jumping to conclusions, gamers and members of GamePolitics wrote to Lang, citing that nobody had even mentioned video games as connection to the mass murders, nor had Robida ever mentioned games on his MySpace weblog. In reply to Andrew Eisen, a member of GamePolitics.com who had written to the mayor over his comments, Mr Lang wrote: > When you get a chance please explain to me the social benefits behind police > and military video games for the future of our children. > While I am not familiar with these videos I have seen enough to know they > can provide no healthy education for our children. Lastly, there is no doubt > in my mind that Mr. Robida played these video games on a regular basis as he > was completely obsessed with weapons, violence and destruction. See his my > space website for more details. I sincerely appreciate your comments. However, examination of Robida's MySpace website (archived on GamePolitics ) showed a passion for Neo-Nazism and Insane Clown Posse, known for its violent and dark lyrics. One song in particular mentions attacking people with a hatchet, similar to Robida's crime. On February 7, Insane Clown Posse released a statement on the Robida attacks. The group's manager Alex Abbiss extended members Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope's condolences and prayers to the families of the victims, stating \\"It's quite obvious that this guy had no clue what being a Juggalo is all about. If anyone knows anything at all about ICP, then you know that they have never, ever been down or will be down with any racist or bigotry bullshit.\\" =Comments from Jack Thompson= On February 7, 2006, Jack Thompson, a disbarred attorney, commented on the incident, describing the bar attack as a \\"killing scenario\\" from Postal² and the killing of Sell a \\"suicide by cop homicide\\" inspired by Grand Theft Auto. Police later dismissed the \\"suicide by cop\\" theory when it was discovered that Robida had fatally shot himself. Thompson claimed to have spoken to a New Bedford detective, who \\"repeatedly\\" said Robida's friends had said \\"he played the Grand Theft Auto games.\\" No further details have emerged, but the following day the Bristol County District Attorney rejected the video game link after examining all the evidence collected from Robida's apartment and car. > My look at the search warrant [for Robida's home] was that the investigators > turned up no video games. From the information we have here, there is no > proof video games were involved.

Voiced by Peri Gilpin, she made her first appearance in the episode \\"Where There's Smoke\\". Fictional character biography ;Superman The Animated Series The supervillainess known as Volcana was originally named Claire Selton. As a teenager, Claire showed an aptitude for pyrokinesis — the ability to start fires with one's mind. Her parents sent her to Metropolis' Center for Paranormal Studies so that she could learn to control and develop her power, but she was soon taken by government agents who had big plans for her. According to the director of the Center, the agents \\"stripped away her past, code-named her Volcana, and tried their hardest to turn her into a living weapon.\\" Volcana wouldn't go along with the plan. She escaped from the agents, became a hunted fugitive and survived the only way she could: by stealing. Following the fire activity on a ship, Volcana contacts her fence Donnie to find a way to get her out of town and to meet at the \\"usual place.\\" After the call with Volcana, Donnie was approached by three men in suits who ask him about where the \\"usual place\\" is. Superman later had a run in with Volcana where they had a brief fight before Volcana escaped. When Volcana arrived at the \\"usual place\\" to meet with Donnie only to run into Kurt (one of the three men in suits) who mentioned that he was the one who originally kidnapped her. Before Volcana can retaliate, she is hit by a powerful flame retardant by the other agents and captured. Superman later arrived at the same spot and managed to interrogate one of the men that worked for Kurt. Volcana ended up held in a gas tank in an underground facility where Kurt states that he will sell Volcana to another government where they will dissect her and discover the source of her abilities. When Superman arrives, he points out that Kurt is doing this for his own reasons as his \\"Project Firestorm\\" was shut down. During Superman's fight with Kurt's men, the gas tank that Volcana was in was damaged enough for her to break out. Volcana managed to wreak havoc on the facility to take revenge on Kurt with her attacks igniting several hydrogen tanks. The explosion managed to stun her while Superman evacuated the endangered combatants. Superman placed her on a deserted island where Superman delivered her food in exchange that she stayed on the island and didn't harm anyone. She later made a cameo appearance in the episode \\"Unity\\", having a brief fight with Supergirl. It is not explained why she left the island or why she returned to villainy despite having been on good terms with Superman. ;Justice League and Justice League Unlimited Justice League episode \\"Only a Dream\\" Volcana made appearances in the episodes \\"Only a Dream\\" and \\"Hereafter\\" of Justice League, voiced again by Peri Gilpin. In the episode Only a Dream Volcana is incarcerated at a Metropolis jail and takes advantage of a prison riot to escape with fellow villain Firefly. She shows a willingness to kill using her powers in this episode, which brings the character to a more sinister level than before. It was established that the government project that created her was part of a long-running collaboration between the U.S. military and major corporations to secretly experiment on metahumans and alien technology. An early version of Project Cadmus existed in the wake of Superman's attempted invasion of Earth while under Darkseid's control, producing the metahuman teenagers of the Royal Flush Gang and the creature Doomsday that fought the Justice Lords. The Justice Lords' attack gave Cadmus renewed focus under Amanda Waller, as the government realized it had no way to counter an attack by the Justice League should they go rogue, and led to the creation of Galatea and the Ultimen. She appears briefly also in a cameo in the episode \\"To Another Shore\\", seen onscreen by Mr. Terrific, while she battles the Red Tornado. She has also appeared as a member of Gorilla Grodd's Secret Society and was seen battling the invading forces of Darkseid in the series finale. In this episode she is shown to fly under her own power, which is probably how she left her island to rejoin society. Volcana witnesses Darkseid's return and was saved by Star Sapphire and Sinestro. She is one of the survivors alive at the end of the battle and was last seen taking advantage of the \\"five minute head start\\" the Justice League gives her after fighting with Darkseid ceased. Comics Volcana has only made two single appearances in the Superman Adventures comics based on her original appearances on the DC Animated Universe, in issues 20 and 41 respectively. In other media =Video games= She appears as a boss in Superman: Shadow of Apokolips and Superman: Countdown to Apokolips. Peri Gilpin reprises her role in both games. =Toys= In 2007, Volcana received her very own action figure as part of Mattel's Justice League Unlimited action figure line. The figure was released as part of a three-figure pack with Hawk and Green Arrow and is about 10 cm tall. However, due to poor distribution of many of the 2007 assortments of JLU action figures, Volcana quickly became one of the rarest and most sought after pieces in the Justice League line.

The Mandrilaftalen troupe consisted of Danish comedians Casper Christensen, Lasse Rimmer, Lars Hjortshøj and Frank Hvam. Heavily inspired by British humor, the show became known for its eccentric characters and absurd sketches, leading to multiple TV critics comparing it To Monty Python's Flying Circus. The show is of a talk show format and is hosted by the character Casper, who is a fictionalization of and is played by the program's creator, Christensen. As the star of the show, Casper usually sits at his desk while satirizing the Danish media industry and interviewing fictional guests. Surreal nonsense is a recurrent characteristic of the show, an example being the character Broder Salsa, who folds carpets to resemble great state leaders and sorts capital cities by muesli. In the show, Casper also holds talent shows with fictional participants, presents episodes of fictional TV series and displays advertisements for fictional products. Rimmer, Hjortshøj and Hvam plays an array of various characters, and the show saw guest appearances from other Danish comedians, the British Monty Python member John Cleese, the Danish actress Susse Wold, the rapper Al Agami, among others. More than 250 different named fictional characters appear in the show, with Broder Salsa, Svenne O'Lotta and Gentleman Finn being the most popular characters according to Christensen. The broadcasts were produced on a tiny budget in a garage on Amager, Copenhagen. Every episode lasts about half an hour and was written, recorded, edited and broadcast in approximately 14 hours. The manuscript for a broadcast was written in the morning, whereafter the broadcast was recorded and edited in four hours at most in the afternoon and finally driven to DR by taxi, from where it was broadcast at 11:30 pm. All sketches were recorded chronologically and edited together along the way. The show was a counterreaction to contemporary television programs, which the troupe considered to be monotonous and poor entertainment. The show had very low viewing figures, which was attributed to its undesirable airing time at 11:30 pm on weekdays as well as DR2's limited national coverage. However, the show received universal acclaim from Danish TV critics and won the prize for Best Entertainment at the Danish TV Prisen in 2000. The show quickly grew a cult following, which led to the launch of multiple fansites and fan clubs as well as bestselling DVD and VHS releases between 2002 and 2004. In the months after the end of the show, the troupe toured the country with eight sold-out live shows based on the broadcasts. They also recorded the spin-off Christmas calendar Casper & Drengene fra Brasilien in less than two days in November 1999. DR2 has since rerun Mandrilaftalen many times, and the show has been referred to as one of the absolute peaks of Danish satire. In 2008, all episodes of the show were digitalized and released on DR's archive website, DR Bonanza, where they can be watched free of charge from anywhere around the world. Background Casper & Mandrilaftalen was a surrealistic comedy sketch and talk show hosted by Casper Christensen. The show was created by Christensen and two other Danish comedians Lasse Rimmer and Lars Hjortshøj. Frank Hvam later joined the program. Many prominent Danish comedians were occasionally part of the program, e.g. Jan Gintberg, Anders Matthesen, , , , and Anders Lund Madsen. The English comedian John Cleese also made an appearance in one episode, as \\"Bosse\\" who pretends to be coach of the Danish national football team. This was a nod to the influence Monty Python had on the show. Episodes were typically written in the morning, filmed in the afternoon, and shown the same evening without much editing being done. This added to the impromptu humor of the show. The first 48 episodes of the show aired on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 23:30 during the first six months of 1999. The next 19 episodes were shown on Wednesday and Friday in the second half of 1999. In 2003, the four comedians met again and made a new episode called \\"Fisso\\". It was released on the second DVD (2006 re-release: third DVD) of Casper & Mandrilaftalen. Format The show revolved around Casper Christensen as the host of what was, ostensibly, a mix of a current events- show, a talkshow and a varietyshow, and the other comedians as guests and crew of the show, with occasional guest-performers and cameos by the actual crew. Christensen also introduced the sketches in the show. The guest were always very strange and abnormal characters, and the humor was very surreal. Recurring characters The show featured many fictional guests, usually interviewed by Casper Christensen in an \\"absurd talkshow\\" style. They were usually played by the Mandril crew. While many characters appeared only once, some would re-appear in many episodes. *Frank Hvam as Bjarne Goldbæk *Frank Hvam as Gentleman Finn *Frank Hvam as Sidney Kreutzfeldt *Frank Hvam as Kresten Pikhår *Frank Hvam as Klaas Gynhjalter *Frank Hvam and Lars Hjortshøj as Rulle & Cromwell *Lars Hjortshøj as Broder Salsa *Lars Hjortshøj as Claes- Jacob Baumspieler aka Jens-Jacob Baumspieler *Lars Hjortshøj as Thore Ellen Hanhøj *Lars Hjortshøj as Smokey Spartacus *Lars Hjortshøj as Peter Schmeichel *Lars Hjortshøj as Ebenezer Kvasthval *Lasse Rimmer as Wesley Snipes *Lasse Rimmer as Pelle Klumpfeber *Lasse Rimmer as Svenne O'lotta External links * Casper & Mandrilaftalen on IMDb * Watch the show free of charge in the DR Bonanza streaming archive Category:Danish comedy television series Category:1999 Danish television series debuts Category:1990s Danish television series Category:Danish-language television shows ","title":"Casper &amp; Mandrilaftalen"},{"id":"3935822","text":"Killzone 2 is a 2009 first-person shooter developed by Guerrilla Games and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 3. It is the second main installment in the Killzone series, following 2004's Killzone. Similar to its predecessor, Killzone 2 takes place in the 24th century and chronicles the war between two human factions; the Vektans, and the Helghast. The game takes place two years after the events of Killzone and follows protagonist Tomas \\"Sev\\" Sevchenko as he and his unit battle the Helghast as the Vektans invade Helghan. The protagonist of Killzone and Killzone: Liberation, Cpt./Col. Jan Templar, returns in a supporting role, along with Rico Velasquez. Killzone 2 is played from a first-person view and allows the player to use a variety of weapons. It was released worldwide in February 2009. Killzone 2 was widely anticipated prior to its release. It was critically acclaimed by critics and fans, who praised it as a superior title to the original Killzone. Additional praise was given to the game's visuals, action, multiplayer modes, soundtrack and atmosphere, although criticism was directed at the narrative. The game's critical and commercial success led to a sequel, Killzone 3, which was released in February 2011. Guerrilla Games announced that the servers for Killzone 2 and Killzone 3 would shut down in March 2018. The servers have since been offline, and can no longer be played online. Gameplay =Campaign= Killzone 2 at E3 2007 The game is presented almost entirely from a first person perspective, aside from vehicular combat. Killzone 2 features a \\"lean and peek\\" cover system which allows the player to take cover behind an object and then pop out to fire at enemies. The \\"lean and peek\\" mechanic stays in first-person view at all times. It is also possible for the player to pilot vehicles at two points in the game: a tank and an exoskeleton. Many classic weapons and vehicles from previous Killzone installments return, such as the M82-G and the StA-52 LAR. The Sixaxis motion control feature is also utilized in performing certain actions such as turning a valve, arming an explosive charge and sniping. =Multiplayer= Warzone, the title of the online multiplayer component of Killzone 2 has been developed by Guerrilla Games in conjunction with the game's single-player campaign. The online multiplayer gameplay is class-based, meaning the player can choose a class of character which is specialized for a specific role to better suit the player's needs in battle. There are 7 classes in total, in which the player can mix and match a main and sub ability according to their playing style, and can switch abilities upon death. There are 15 weapons available to the player, most of which cannot be used until the player reaches a certain rank. Two of these weapons are secondary firearms, and a further two weapons, the Boltgun and Flamethrower, are exclusive to the downloadable maps \\"Suljeva Cliffside\\" and \\"Arctower Landing\\". Players play as either the ISA or Helghast, with a few gameplay differences. The character model and respawn points, and the \\"lean and peek\\" cover systems were removed. Each class levels up with experience gained from killing enemies or completing mission objectives. With enough experience, players unlock new weapons and skills, as well as a new class. Each class has two badges, the Primary badge selects the class and their specified skill. The secondary badge has an extra skill for the specified class but can be swapped to create own custom class. Warzone plays out through dynamic matches where multiple game types are played in a single round. The game does not reset between game types, instead flowing between them, with the winning team determined by who wins the most modes. The game ships with five different game types including Assassination, Search & Retrieve, Search & Destroy, Bodycount and Capture & Hold. Online matches can connect 2 to 32 players, and they can group into six squads of up to four players. If an online match does not have a full 32 players, computer- generated \\"bots\\" can be added in to create bigger teams (but only in an unranked match). Killzone 2 also offers a clan system, which allows clans of up to 64 players to compete for \\"Valor Points\\", an in-game currency that clans can use to bet on tournaments. Players can also play offline against AIs with Skirmish mode and unranked online multiplayer, but there is no offline multiplayer mode for splitscreen players. Eight multiplayer maps are included on disc at release, but Guerrilla has released more maps as downloadable content. 6 more maps have been added to multiplayer since release via downloadable content purchasable from the PlayStation Store. Plot Two years after the attempted Helghast invasion of Vekta, an ISA fleet led by Colonel Jan Templar is sent to attack Pyrrhus, the capital city of Helghan, with the goal of deposing and arresting Emperor Scolar Visari on charges of war crimes. Among the ISA units taking part in the attack is Alpha Squad, led by Jan's old comrade Ricardo \\"Rico\\" Velasquez. Sergeant Tomas \\"Sev\\" Sevchenko, a veteran of the ISA \\"Legion\\" battalion, is assigned to serve as his second- in-command. Tasked with securing Pyrrhus against the fierce resistance of the Helghan Second Army, the team quickly discovers that the Helghast are well prepared for an invasion. Using Helghan's harsh environment to their advantage, they have developed new weapons and equipment, none of which the ISA has ever seen before. Furthermore, the planet's fog-like atmosphere, gritty deserts, and constant storms pose almost as much of a threat to the invaders as the enemy themselves. =Story= Led by Jan's flagship, the New Sun, the ISA bombard Pyrrhus as cover for a massive ground assault on the city. Despite stiff resistance from well-armed Helghast divisions, they steadily advance towards the Imperial Palace, ultimately capturing both Visari Square and the Helghan Military Academy. Just as the main convoy is set to attack the palace, Colonel Mael Radec, commander of the Second Army, activates a network of arc towers hidden beneath Pyrrhus, killing hundreds of ISA soldiers and breaking their momentum. Dante Garza, a member of Alpha Squad and close friend of Tomas's, retrieves a piece of a destroyed tower and sends it to ISA researcher Evelyn Batton, who learns that the towers are powered by Petrusite, a mineral capable of generating and channeling electricity. She also identifies an old mining outpost on the outskirts of Pyrrhus where the Helghast have been secretly extracting it for military use. While working to restore the outpost's communication antenna, Tomas and Rico are separated from the rest of Alpha Squad, allowing Radec's men to capture them. The two fight their way through the refinery where the captives were taken, stumbling upon an interrogation overseen by Radec himself. Oddly enough, he demands that Evelyn give him the launch codes to a set of stolen nuclear warheads in Helghast custody. Rico loses his temper and surprises Radec, saving the captives but leaving Garza mortally wounded. Blaming him for his friend's death, Tomas and the squad return to the New Sun. Before Garza can be properly mourned, an elite Helghast battalion led by Radec mounts a surprise attack on the fleet, boarding or destroying several ships including the Sun. The ship's crew manages to evacuate, but Radec reaches the bridge and executes Jan and Evelyn, downloading the codes before they can be deleted. With the last of his strength, Jan maneuvers the ship to crash into the center of Helghan's Petrusite distribution grid, causing it to explode and disrupt the arc network. Seizing the opportunity, the survivors attempt to regroup, only to witness Visari detonate the warheads over Pyrrhus, destroying it and killing both the entire population and most of the remaining ISA forces. With ISA captain Jason Narville leading an offensive on the remnants of the Second Army, Alpha Squad breaches the palace, where they encounter Radec and the imperial guard. After a pitched battle, the wounded commander and his men commit mass suicide out of disgrace, clearing the way to Visari's throne room. As Tomas moves to arrest him, Visari gloats that he has still won, as the Helghast are now united against the ISA, and without him, they cannot be stopped. Overcome with guilt, Rico kills him on the spot. Weary from fighting, Tomas exits the palace and sits on the steps. Above him, a large armada belonging to the Helghan First Army begins its attack on what is left of the ISA invasion force. Development At E3 2005, Killzone 2 was debuted with a trailer depicting soldiers landing in a hostile war-zone on Helghan and fighting Helghast forces. Critics in the media argued that the trailer shown at the trade show did not show actual gameplay footage, as its high level of visual detail has been argued to be impossible to render in real-time on the PlayStation 3 and the audio mix of the trailer was slightly delayed. SCEA's Vice President, Jack Tretton, stated that the footage of Killzone 2, that was believed to be pre-rendered, \\"is real gameplay everybody's seeing out there\\". Several days later, Phil Harrison, SCE Europe's Vice President of Development, stated in an interview that all of the footage of PlayStation 3 games at E3 2005 were \\"running off video\\" which was \\"done to PS3 spec\\". Further interviews eventually revealed the trailer was indeed a \\"target render\\", a prerendered video showing the developer's goals for the finished product. At the Game Developers Conference in 2007, a Killzone 2 teaser was shown behind closed doors, and was never released to the public. It featured various battles, destructible environments, and lighting effects among others. Killzone 2 was shown to a panel of journalists at a special pre-E3 2007 event in Culver City, California, and then the next day to the public at Sony's E3 press conference. An in-game trailer showing real-time gameplay of Killzone 2 was also released, along with several videos of extended gameplay. A number of media outlets since E3, such as the BBC, have referred to Killzone 2 as being \\"one of the most cinematic and immersive games ever produced on a console.\\" At the Leipzig Games Convention in 2007, Killzone 2 was presented in playable form to the media. It was the same demo level as shown at E3 2007, although journalists were allowed to play it hands-on. At Sony's PlayStation Day 2008, the first level in Killzone 2’s single-player campaign was presented, named \\"Corinth River\\". Michal Valient, a Senior Programmer at Guerrilla Games, presented details of their Killzone 2 proprietary game engine at a Developers Conference in July 2007. As with many other titles published by SCE, including LittleBigPlanet and Infamous, Killzone 2 uses a deferred shading engine which enables far greater control over the game's characteristic lighting palette, while maximising processor throughput and limiting shader complexity. Other games to use similar approaches include Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto IV and GSC Game World's S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl. However, this approach does create some additional problems; notably with respect to anti- aliasing and transparencies. The former was solved using a MSAA Quincunx (multisample anti-aliasing) solution, and the latter by the addition of a standard forward rendering path. The game's graphics were universally praised by critics. The animation was done in Maya 8.5 with some motion capture animations tweaked in MotionBuilder. 3D artists, animators and level designers used Maya as their production environment, which is unusual considering that most 3D games are produced using 3ds max. A large library of custom Maya tools and scripts was created to support these different disciplines. Tools like \\"Hyperion\\", a lightmap rendering software, were used in place of Maya's viewport rendering software. In-game animation was assisted with another tool they created called \\"AnimationBlender\\" and particle effects were edited using a tool called \\"Particle Editor\\". They also created a tool called \\"ColorTweaker\\", which gave them the possibility to do color correction on the PS3 in real-time. Most of the animation was done using motion capture with some animations, reload animations for example, done by hand. Facial animation was done using blendshapes with bones for the jaw and the eyes. Lead tech artist, Paulus Bannink, explains that \\"The main reason for going with blendshapes was the relative ease with which they can be transferred to different faces, it would also provide a more artist friendly way of editing the facial animation rig.\\". The cut scene facial animation was done using marker motion capture. In game dialog was done generically using MotionBuilder after audio files were plugged in. The game was developed not only by artists in Amsterdam, but also by people living in New Zealand, Australia, Japan, Korea, the UK and the US. The data files, gigabytes in size, were sent over the internet. Killzone 2s budget was originally US$ 20 million but rose to US$40–45 million at the end of the development. =Soundtrack= The score to Killzone 2 was composed by Joris de Man, who scored 60 minutes of in-game music and 30-minutes of live orchestral score for the game, recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London, with the Nimrod Studio Orchestra. The score was produced and mixed by Rich Aitken, regular mix partner for Joris de Man and Marc Canham, at Nimrod Productions. Release Beta access was given to a select number of North American and European PlayStation Network subscribers. The beta consisted of three online multiplayer maps; \\"Blood Gracht\\" (small), \\"Radec Academy\\" (medium) and \\"Salamun Market\\" (large), with unlockable ranks and character classes (\\"badges\\"). Beta testers had their own statistics and have the ability to enter clan competitions. Beta access was private and thus could not be shared with other PlayStation Network accounts. Also, beta testers are tied with Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. by a non-disclosure agreement; therefore they were not allowed to reveal contents of the beta experience. A technical demo of one of Killzone 2's TV commercials, known as the \\"Bullet\\" trailer, was released on the PlayStation Store on April 2, 2009. The demo features the commercial itself, the ability to shift camera angles and film speed, and several commentaries from key development staff at Guerrilla Games. On February 5, SCEE released a single player demo of Killzone 2 on the European/Oceanic PlayStation Store. The demo includes the first two sections of ‘Corinth River’ (the first level of the game) as well as the tutorial sequence from the final game. A demo card, granting access to a Killzone 2 demo was also offered to US gamers who pre-ordered the game at GameStop. The US demo was also made available to those customers on February 5, 2009. In the North American version of PlayStation Home, if users found an avatar dressed in a Helghast costume, the avatar with the Helghast costume would give that user a code for the demo. This occurred on February 16, 2009. On February 26, the demo was made available for download from the PlayStation Store in North America. Guerrilla Games announced that the servers for Killzone 2 and Killzone 3 would shut down on March 29, 2018. The servers have since been offline, and can no longer be played online. =PlayStation Home= In the North American version of PlayStation Home, if users pre-ordered Killzone 2 from Amazon.com, users received free male and female I.S.A. and Helghast uniforms for their avatar. In the European version of PlayStation Home, if users participated in the \\"Killzone AM\\" event that took place on Saturday March 28, 2009 at 11 am CET for one full round, the Home Managers gave the participants a code for the Killzone 2 uniforms. Requirement was that users had to have a United Kingdom PSN account. For a limited time in Japanese Home, users received an I.S.A. uniform for watching the Killzone 2 trailer and answering a questionnaire. To get the Helghast uniform in Japan, users had to do a pre-order. In Home's shopping complex, there are fourteen — seven for male and seven for female — Killzone 2 themed shirts available for purchase as well as the Helghast Tactician uniform. A costume for Radec was released on March 4, 2010 to the European Home and has been released in the North American. Guerrilla Games have released a Killzone 2 themed apartment called the \\"Visari Throne Room\\" for Home. The Visari Throne Room apartment is based on the throne room inside Visari's Palace from the final mission of Killzone 2. For the Visari Throne Room, there are five pieces of furniture based on actual palace furnishings from Killzone 2: two types of Visari-style chairs, an administrative desk, a plant container with authentic Helghan vegetation, and a freestanding painting which portrays an important moment in the colonial history of the Helghast. The Visari Throne Room and matching furniture were made available to the European Home on July 2, 2009, the North American on August 27, 2009, and the Asian and Japanese Home on October 9, 2009. =Downloadable content= On April 10, 2009 Hermen Hulst, Managing Director from Guerrilla Games announced on GameTrailers TV that Killzone 2 would get a DLC map pack named \\"Steel & Titanium\\" which would contain two new maps called Wasteland Bullet and Vekta Cruiser. With new gameplay elements and strategic twists. The first DLC map pack was released on Thursday, April 30. Hulst stated that the next Killzone 2 DLC map pack that they were releasing would have a 'Retro Vibe' to it. The second map pack was officially announced on May 20, 2009 as \\"Flash and Thunder\\", and features two maps previously seen in Killzone called \\"Beach Head\\" and \\"The Southern Hills\\". Both maps followed the first map pack by bringing new gameplay elements and strategic twists; Beach Head, the wide open battlefield, with rain-filled trenches, and Southern Hills with its intermittent nuke explosion. It was released on June 11, 2009. Both map packs have twelve trophies that go along with them, six for each map. On July 10 the third map pack was officially announced, even though Sony stated that there were no plans for a third pack. The DLC \\"Napalm and Cordite\\" was released on July 23, 2009, it contained two new maps \\"Suljeva Cliffside\\" and \\"Arctower Landing\\", in addition to the maps the Flamethrower and the Boltgun both from singleplayer made their debut in multiplayer. The Flamethrower is found in the Suljeva Cliffside map and the Boltgun is found in the Arctower Landing map. A multiplayer map pack bundle was also released to coincide with the release of Napalm and Cordite, containing all six maps from the DLC packs, for the price of four maps. The downloadable content pack three has eight trophies that go along with it, four for each map which are for the new weapons. With the fifth anniversary of the original Killzone taking place, the map pack \\"Flash & Thunder\\" was reduced in price in North America and Europe. Reception Killzone 2 received \\"universal acclaim\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Critics praised the graphics, presentation, intense action, gameplay, and multiplayer, with criticism aimed towards the story and characters. PlayStation: The Official Magazine said that players \\"will instantly tag this sequel as a powerful contender for best game of 2009.\\" GamesMaster said that the game's ambition \\"was to be the best FPS on PS3. At this moment in time, we're not going to argue.\\" 1UP.com said: \\"With its unparalleled graphics, incredibly well-paced single-player campaign and in-depth multiplayer offerings, Killzone 2 has established its place among top-tier console shooters. Expectations on Killzone 2 had reached ridiculous proportions; here's one of those cases where the game actually lived up to them.\\" GamePro praised the game's graphics technology and multiplayer depth. In their review, Edge praised the online multiplayer, attention to detail, \\"unparalleled graphics\\" and the pacing of the single-player campaign, but included criticism of the game's use of \\"gameplay clichés\\" and its weak storyline and characters. GameSpot did not review the game until after its release so that they could experience its online multiplayer features in more depth. Reviewer Kevin VanOrd said: \\"Killzone 2 boasts amazing visuals, an intense campaign, and extraordinary online play that will keep you coming back for more.\\" but described the game's story and characters as \\"forgettable\\" and said that the motion controls seemed \\"tacked-on\\". In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of 32 out of 40. The A.V. Club gave it an A− and said, \\"Consider the simplistic storyline a training ground for the surprisingly varied online game, and overdose on visual splendor every step of the way.\\" Wired gave it nine stars out of ten and said, \\"While Killzone 2 does walk on mostly well- trodden ground, it does so with a keen attention to style and detail, pushing beyond the gray-and-red color schemes that define its competition while encouraging gamers to put a little bit of thought behind every bullet they hurl.\\" The Daily Telegraph also gave it nine out of ten, saying that it was \\"not a revolution. It was never intended to be. However, it would be folly to disregard its importance, both to the PS3 and the console FPS. It's a refinement of the genre, distilled to its purest and polished to a glittering shine.\\" However, Teletext GameCentral gave it seven out of ten, calling it \\"One of the best looking games ever, but also one of the least ambitious in terms of anything else.\\" Killzone 2 won 'Best PS3 Shooter' from IGN. It won 'Best Competitive Multiplayer', 'Best Sound Design', 'Most Improved Sequel', and 'Best Shooter' from GameSpot editor's choice. It won 'Best Graphics' in the G-Phoria 2009 Awards. It also took in Game of the Year from Gamereactor. The soundtrack also won gaming's first Ivor Novello Award. =Sales= The debut sales of Killzone 2 in the United States were 323,000 within 48 hours of launch. The game failed to meet expectations in March and April, when it sold 296,000 and 58,000 units respectively; by the beginning of May, the game had sold 677,000 copies in the United States. Killzone 2 debuted at number one in UK sales to become the fourth fastest-selling Sony published title. In Japan, the game debuted at number 3, selling 41,000 units. On April 16, 2009, Sony announced that sales of Killzone 2 had surpassed one million worldwide.

Though Walter is portrayed as the antagonist of the strip, he is often a victim of Dennis' bullying. Walter made his first appearance in the Beano in 1953 and is the primary target of Dennis and his friends. His last name was first mentioned in \\"A Beano Christmas Carol\\" strip in 1994. Two issues in 2012 finally confirmed that his surname was indeed Brown. Profile Walter has traditionally been portrayed as a camp and effeminate boy, always very stereotypically girly in his behaviour: this varied from a strong aversion to typically \\"masculine\\" interests and situations, to full-blown transvestism. While these tendencies have vanished in modern years, Walter is still portrayed as a typical \\"geek\\", wearing a blue schoolboy's jumper, schoolboy's shorts, a bow tie, and has glasses and slicked-back hair. Walter lives next door to Dennis and his family. In earlier years, he often spent time in his Wendy house with his gang \\"the Softies\\", playing with dolls or pressing flowers etc. He regularly features in the Dennis the Menace strip; when he appears, he is usually either being attacked by Dennis or involved in a plot to attack Dennis himself—traditionally involving either chess or perfume. Though these attacks, in earlier years, arguably represented a legitimate feud between the Menaces and Softies, it was often difficult to interpret them as much deeper than his being bullied by Dennis for his effeminate nature or positive attributes. Walter is often seen as a devoted and seemingly \\"perfect\\" child. He does well in school and is adored by his teachers and parents. Indeed, Walter is a stereotypical mummy's boy and a spoiled brat, luxuriously pampered by his wealthy parents — who, rather uncannily, resemble each other. In earlier years, Walter had a white cat called Fluffy and a pink poodle named Foo Foo. In 2012, a new cat named Claudius was introduced. Issue 1712 (10 May 1975) featured a girl named Priscilla, described by Dennis as Walter's sister, but she has not appeared since. In one story, he and Dennis are revealed to be distant cousins, but nothing more has been said of this. = Personal life = Walter is Dennis' neighbour and arch-enemy, most likely because he is the complete opposite of Dennis: Dennis being wild and naughty, and Walter being calm, intelligent and \\"soft.\\" He is always Teacher's Pet at school. Walter is strongly disliked by Dennis because of his teddy-bear picnics and softy antics. Walter long had two apparent friends named Algernon 'Spotty' Perkins and Bertie Blenkinsop. They were equally as camp as Walter, and the three of them often wore their mothers' clothes and makeup. In more recent years, the former bit player Dudley Nightshirt has replaced Spotty as third-in-command. Walter also got himself a girlfriend named Matilda, who bore an eerie resemblance to him, except that she was a redhead, and obviously wore a schoolgirl's uniform. She also spoke with a lisp and can sometimes lose her temper. For example, Walter brings her a bunch of ragged nettles and dandelions because he had lost his glasses, and she angrily slams the door in his face. She appeared in the 1996 TV series of Dennis and Gnasher (although a character with the same name appeared in at least one comic library from 1993), and has also appeared in The Beano Video, to which she makes a cameo appearance during \\"Pink Glove\\". Also, his evil uncle, Slasher Brown, who owns a barber shop in Beanotown, tries to cut Dennis' hair live on TV, but fails, as it is revealed that Dennis had a wig, landing Walter in trouble. Walter is sometimes scared, but can sometimes act spoilt rotten as explained in the 1996, 2009 and 2013 series. Other Softies have included Sweet William, Jeremy Snodgrass, Softy Matthew and Nervous Rex, a boy who was scared of everything and everyone. They all share the same characteristics as Walter. Walter has been punished many times despite his well-behaved nature. In the recent comics, he has dropped his soft personality, and now is ingenious, ambitious, intelligent, and wants to rid Beanotown of all its fun. Truth be told, the Softies often seem to be bound together much more by fear of Dennis than by any real mutual liking; though they are scrupulously polite and strangely devoted to each other, they have occasionally decided to pick on someone perceived as a much bigger wimp than they are. Naturally, there are not many of these people. There have also been occasions in which Walter has willingly helped Dennis: when Gnasher went missing in the 80s, he tried to help Dennis find him, and more recently, he has helped Dennis several times: finding Gnipper's long-lost sisters when the puppy had been poisoned, helping Rasher win a pig race, and trying to save Dennis's favourite tree by chaining himself to it, thus changing his relationship with Dennis from enemies to, if not outright friends, civil rivals. A likely reason for this is increased public awareness of bullying and the increasing unacceptability of a comic featuring a bully/victim relationship that stars the bully as protagonist. Depictions over time In early years (1950s-60s), Walter was a prim boy but nevertheless brash, snooty, and often sneaky in his attempts to embarrass or otherwise hinder Dennis and Gnasher. By the late 1970s, however, the increasingly \\"soft\\" Walter became terrified of Dennis, as well as other (mostly harmless) aspects of life, such as butterflies, birds, rain, and the like. If he encountered the things that scared him, he often cried childishly and ran to his 'mummy', sure that she would pamper and protect him. In the 1980s and 1990s, Walter often dressed as a girl: typically wearing a pink ballerina tutu for dance purposes, but occasionally simply wearing a dress, along with his mother's makeup. His parents did not seem to be disturbed by Walter's transvestitism; in fact, on some occasions, they appeared to encourage it. In some strips, he was seen to wear pink boxer-shorts, mostly with either love-hearts or bunny rabbits on them. Walter had a teddy bear named 'Teddikins', which he often carried with him to complete the ensemble. In the 1996 television series, Walter was not scared of Dennis but instead acted like a snob, living in a huge house and behaving more like a spoiled brat than before. His behaviour generally resembled his pre-1970s comics behaviour, and is reflected again in his less \\"soft\\" modern comics roles. Walter's vindictiveness and determination to get Dennis into trouble have been highlighted in recent years, making Dennis' behaviour appear less like bullying. In a 2013 interview with The Guardian, Beano editor Mike Stirling said that Walter was Dennis' nemesis because \\"he strangles the fun out of everything. He doesn't want to be a kid, he wants to be a grownup and is always snitching on kids who are having fun\\". The paper suggested that Walter had become less weedy not just out of changing attitudes but because it was \\"hardly... dramatically satisfying\\" if Dennis could beat him up. Possible homosexuality Because of Walter's profoundly feminine behaviour, some critics have led to the assumption that Walter is actually gay. Because of this speculation, not only did he have a girlfriend created for him, but Dennis the Menace also had to soften his antics against Walter in fear it would be seen as homophobic bullying. Parodies * Walter is parodied in some editions of the adult comic Viz as \\"Cedric Soft\\" in the strip about popular character Biffa Bacon. Their relationship is in a similar vein to Walter's with Dennis, with extreme comic violence added. * In the Judge Dredd story Judgement Day, the villain's origin was a pastiche of the Beano: Soppi Walter, routinely terrorised and attacked by the bully Big Den (surname shown as \\"Mennis\\"). Soppi turned out to be a sociopath and learned necromancy in order to kill, resurrect, and torture his bully.2000 AD issue 797: Judgement Day Part 17 * In April 2018, Beano Studios issued a cease and desist letter to Jacob Rees-Mogg, a prominent British right-wing Conservative MP with upper middle-class mannerisms, asserting that Rees-Mogg was imitating Walter.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2018/04/04/jacob-rees-mogg-told- stop-impersonating-walter-softy-beano- threatens/https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/beano-accuses-jacob-rees-mogg-of- impersonating-walter-the-softy-1-4718271 References Category:DC Thomson Comics characters Category:Child characters in comics Category:Comics characters introduced in 1953 ","title":"Walter the Softy"},{"id":"3935843","text":"The Psylli (Seli) were a native Berber tribe inhabiting Ancient Libya. Historical accounts Pliny the Elder (Hist. Nat., vii 14) places the Psylli on the Syrtic coast above the Garamantes, and gives Psyllikos Kolpos as an early name of the Syrtic Gulf. According to John C. Murphy, \\"the Psylli were the displaced remnants of an ancient Libyan tribe that lived on the Gulf of Sidra. Conquered by the nomadic Nasamones, the Psylli became a well-known snake-charming sect.\\"John C. Murphy, Secrets of the Snake Charmer , 9781450221269 iUniversity 2010, p. 8 Of the Psylli, Herodotus described \\"a tribe that met with extinction\\" after the desert wind dried up their water holes (IV.173). Pliny the Elder said that they were \\"almost exterminated\\" in a war with their neighbours, the Nasamones, but the descendants of those who escaped \\"survive today in a few places\\" (VII.2.14). Strabo does not mention an unsuccessful war against either the desert wind or the Nasamones but only that the Psylli were still in existence, occupying \\"a barren and arid region\\" (XVII.3.23) below the Nasamones. Later writers, especially poets, bestowed on the Psylli a reputation as great snake charmers. In his Roman History, Cassius Dio makes reference to the Psylli as being sought out by Octavian to draw out the snake venom with which Cleopatra had poisoned herself (LI.14). According to Dio, the Psylli were completely immune to snake bites and were all male (LI.14). Lucan, speaking of the Psylli, whose peculiar property it was to be unhurt by the bite of serpents with which their country abounded, wrote: \\"Of all who scorching Afric's sun endure, None like the swarthy Psyllians are secure: With healing gifts and privileges graced, Well in the land of serpents were they placed: Truce with the dreadful tyrant death they have, And border safely on his realm the grave\\" (Pharsalia ix. 891, trans. by Rowe) Customs It is claimed that the Psylli employed tests by animals in order to find out if their offspring was genuine and at the same time if their wives were faithful. Infant Psylli were subjected to snake-bites. If the infant died of the snakebite, illegitimacy was supposed to be implied.

The bay at San Sebastián, Spain The Bay of Bengal in South Asia The Bothnian Bay at Kalajoki, Finland The bay of Baracoa, Cuba A bay is a recessed, coastal body of water that directly connects to a larger main body of water, such as an ocean, a lake, or another bay. A large bay is usually called a gulf, sea, sound, or bight. A cove is a type of smaller bay with a circular inlet and narrow entrance. A fjord is a particularly steep bay shaped by glacial activity. A bay can be the estuary of a river, such as the Chesapeake Bay, an estuary of the Susquehanna River. Bays may also be nested within each other; for example, James Bay is an arm of Hudson Bay in northeastern Canada. Some large bays, such as the Bay of Bengal and Hudson Bay, have varied marine geology. The land surrounding a bay often reduces the strength of winds and blocks waves. Bays may have as wide a variety of shoreline characteristics as other shorelines. In some cases, bays have beaches, which \\"are usually characterized by a steep upper foreshore with a broad, flat fronting terrace\\".Maurice Schwartz, Encyclopedia of Coastal Science (2006), p. 129. Bays were significant in the history of human settlement because they provided safe places for fishing. Later they were important in the development of sea trade as the safe anchorage they provide encouraged their selection as ports. Definition The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) defines a bay as a well-marked indentation whose penetration is in such proportion to the width of its mouth as to contain land-locked waters and constitute more than a mere curvature of the coast. An indentation shall not, however, be regarded as a bay unless its area is as large as, or larger than, that of the semi-circle whose diameter is a line drawn across the mouth of that indentation. Formation There are various ways in which bays can form. The largest bays have developed through plate tectonics. As the super-continent Pangaea broke up along curved and indented fault lines, the continents moved apart and left large bays; these include the Gulf of Guinea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Bay of Bengal, which is the world's largest bay. Bays also form through coastal erosion by rivers and glaciers. A bay formed by a glacier is a fjord. Rias are created by rivers and are characterised by more gradual slopes. Deposits of softer rocks erode more rapidly, forming bays, while harder rocks erode less quickly, leaving headlands.

As the Elora Gorge Conservation Area, it is one of many conservation areas owned by the Grand River Conservation Authority. About The Grand River flows through the bottom of the gorge, approximately long, with limestone cliffs reaching high. It was formed from glacial meltwaters from the previous ice age. The area includes a park with camping sites, hiking trails, and is also popular for kayaking and tubing. Located nearby is the \\"old swimming hole\\", at the Elora Quarry Conservation Area, a 0.8 hectare (two acre) former limestone quarry encircled by sheer cliffs up to high. Elora Quarry did not become a conservation area until 1976, but it was a popular swimming area long before that. Elora gorge The Elora Gorge Falls are a roughly tall waterfall located upstream from the Elora Gorge.Elora Gorge Falls - Great Lakes Waterfalls & Beyond Popular activities at the site include: camping, canoeing, fishing, hiking, cycling, swimming, picnicking, and tubing.

It stands on the southeastern shore of Llanquihue Lake, and also towers over Todos los Santos Lake. Osorno is considered a symbol of the local landscape, and is noted for its similar appearance to Mount Fuji. Osorno is one of the most active volcanoes of the southern Chilean Andes, with 11 historical eruptions recorded between 1575 and 1869. The basalt and andesite lava flows generated during these eruptions reached both Llanquihue and Todos los Santos Lakes. The upper slopes of the volcano are almost entirely covered in glaciers despite its very modest altitude and latitude, sustained by the substantial snowfall in the very moist maritime climate of the region. This mountain also produces pyroclastic flow, since it is a composite volcano. Osorno sits on top of a 250,000-year-old eroded stratovolcano, La Picada, with a 6-km-wide caldera. Trivia * Charles Darwin glimpsed Volcán Osorno from a distance in the course of the second voyage of the Beagle, catching sight of its eruption in January 1835. * Volcán Osorno was used as the backdrop for promotional photos and video in Motorola's 2005 global advertising campaign for the PEBL mobile phone.

The show is based upon the true story of Major John Singleton Mosby, a Virginia officer in the Confederate Army, whose cunning and stealth earned him the nickname \\"Gray Ghost\\". Synopsis The Gray Ghost stars Tod Andrews as Major Mosby, Phil Chambers as Sergeant Myles Magruder, and Sherwood Price in five episodes as General J.E.B. Stuart, also known for his cavalry skills. Recurring characters on the program were Donald Foster as Braddock, Jean Willes as Ansonia, Ralph Clanton as a general, Dick Jones as Ned Underwood, Otto Aldis as Mueller and John Banner as Major Heros von Borcke. Gray Ghost was cancelled after one season of thirty-nine half-hour episodes. High production costs may have made the program too expensive to continue. Production notes The series was created by Lindsley Parsons Productions; the producer was Russell Hayden. William Paul Dunlap wrote the theme song. Virgil Carrington Jones, an expert on Mosby, was historical consultant for some episodes. There are also two popular misconceptions about the series. The first is that it aired on the CBS network; it never did. The second is that the network and the sponsor did not wish to be affiliated with a show about Confederate soldiers. Syndicated shows, by definition, have no network sponsors. In New York City, The Gray Ghost ran not on WCBS-TV (Channel 2) but on WPIX (Channel 11), an independent station. It ran Thursdays from 8:30-9:00 p.m. The series was distributed \\"in association with CBS Television film series.\\" Such closing credits gave some the wrong impression that the program had aired on CBS.

Edict of Rothari; also Edictus Rothari or Edictum Rotharis) was the first written compilation of Lombard law, codified and promulgated on 22 November 643 by King Rothari. According to Paul the Deacon, the 8th century Lombard historian, the custom law of the Lombards (Lombardic: cawarfidae) had been held in memory before this. The Edict, recorded in Vulgar Latin, comprised primarily the Germanic custom law of the Lombards, with some modifications to limit the power of feudal rulers and strengthen the authority of the king. Although the edict has been drafted in Latin, few lombard words were untranslatable, as \\"grabworfin, arga, sculdhais, morgingab, metfio, federfio, mahrworfin, launegild, thinx, waregang, gastald, mundius, angargathung, fara, walupaus, gairethinx, aldius, actugild or, wegworin\\". The Edict, divided in 388 chapters, was primitive in comparison to other Germanic legislation of the time. It was also comparatively late, for the Franks, Visigoths, and Anglo- Saxons had all compiled codices of law long before. Unlike the 6th century Breviarium Alaricianum of Visigoth king Alaric II, the Edict was mostly Germanic tribal law dealing with weregilds, inheritance, and duels, not a code of Roman law. In spite of its Latin language, it was not a Roman product, and unlike the near-contemporary Forum Iudicum of the Visigoths, it was not influenced by Canon law. Its only dealings with ecclesial matters was a prohibition on violence in churches. The Edict gives military authority to the dukes and gives civil authority to a schulthais (or reeve) in the countryside and a castaldus (or gastald) in cities. It was written down by one Ansoald, a scribe of Lombard origin, and was affirmed by a gairethinx convened by Rothari in 643. The gairethinx was a gathering of the army that passed the law by clashing their spears on their shields in old Germanic fashion, a fitting passing for a Latin code that was so Germanic. The Edict makes no references to public life, the governance of trade or the duties of a citizen; instead, it is minutely concerned with compensations for wrongs, a feature familiar from the weregild system of Anglo-Saxons and the defence of property rights. Though Lombard women were always in some status of wardship to the males of the family—and a freeborn Lombard woman who married an aldius (semi-free man) or a slave might be slain or sold by her male kin—the respect, amounting to a taboo, that was owed to a freeborn Lombard woman was notable. Anyone who would \\"place himself in the way\\" (injure) of a free woman or girl must pay 900 solidi, an immense sum. For comparison, anyone who would \\"place himself in the way\\" of a free man had to pay him 20 solidi if there was no bodily injury, and in similar cases involving another man's slave, handmaid or aldius, 20 solidi to the lord had to be paid as the price for copulation with another man's slave. Roman slaves were of lower value in these matters compared to Germanic slaves. Physical injuries were all minutely catalogued, with a price set for damage done to each tooth, finger or toe. Property was a concern: many laws in the Edict dealt specifically with injuries to an aldius or to a household slave. A still lower class, according to their assigned values, were the agricultural slaves. In the laws pertaining to inheritance, illegitimate offspring had rights as well as legitimate ones. No father could disinherit his son except for certain grievous crimes. Donations of property were made in the presence of an assembly called the thinc, which gave rise to the barbarous Latin verb thingare, to grant or donate before witnesses. If a man wishes to thingare his property, he must make the gairethinx (\\"spear donation\\") in the presence of free men. Slaves might be emancipated in various ways, but there were severe laws for the pursuit and restoration of fugitives. In judicial procedure, a system of compurgation prevailed, as well as the wager of battle. The general assembly of free men continued to add ritual solemnity to important acts such as the enactment of new laws or the selection of a king. Lombard law applied to Lombards solely. The Roman population ruled by Lombard aristocracy expected to live under long-codified Roman law. The Edict stipulated that foreigners who came to settle in Lombard territories were expected to live according to the laws of the Lombards unless they obtained from the king the right to live according to some other law. Later, by the reign of King Liutprand (712–743), most inhabitants of Lombard Italy were considered Lombards regardless of their ancestry and followed Lombard Law.

He previously played in the Football League for Walsall, Rochdale, Chester City, Darlington, Torquay United and Barnet and in the USL First Division for the Puerto Rico Islanders and Rochester Rhinos. He first appeared for the Kenya national team in June 2009, and is currently employed as an intermediate coach at the FA.https://twitter.com/TyAtieno Club career =England= Born Opiyo Taiwo Leo Awounda, Atieno is the son of Moussa Awounda, a former Nation Newspapers correspondent, and Bridget Mary Glaisher,. As a teen he began his football career at the age of 15 with Walsall F.C.. After graduating from the club's youth system, during which time he spent a month with Southern League Premier Division club Nuneaton Borough on work experience, Atieno signed professional contract forms in July 2004 under then manager Paul Merson. He had loan spells at Rochdale, Chester City, Kidderminster Harriers, and Darlington. Atieno was released by the club at the end of the 2005–06 season following their relegation from League One. After leaving Walsall F.C. Atieno joined Conference National club Tamworth in August 2006. Atieno scored 12 league goals, though these were not enough to keep Tamworth from relegation to the Conference North in April 2007. =United States= Atieno left Tamworth after the 2006–07 season, moving to the United States to join USL First Division team Puerto Rico Islanders. Signing in July, Atieno started his spell well, scoring 7 goals in 12 games. The Islanders surpassed expectations reaching the semi finals of the USL playoffs. Atieno providing 2 goals against an experienced Montreal Impact side. In the 2008 campaign, Atieno scored a historic goal advancing Puerto Rico Islanders to CONCACAF Champions League group stages. Islanders overcame a 2–1 deficit to knock out the Primera División de Costa Rica L.D. Alajuelense. L.D. Alajuelense was the first Costa Rican team to win a CONCACAF Champions' Cup in 1986. In March 2009, Atieno joined Rochester Rhinos of the USL First Division; he had been traded to Charleston Battery during the off-season, but had not played for them. =Back to England= He moved back to England with Conference Premier team Luton Town in March 2010 on a short-term contract, but left in July. After training with South African club Supersport United during the English summer, he rejoined Luton on 2 September 2010 on a contract until January 2011 after no deal with the South Africans was forthcoming. Atieno scored his first goal for Luton against Bath City on 30 October. This was then followed up with two goals in a 4–2 FA Cup First Round replay victory over Corby Town on 17 November. Atieno's goal-scoring form continued into January where he followed up a brace of goals in the FA Trophy against Uxbridge with the final goal (his seventh of the season in all competitions) in Luton's 5–0 home win over York City on 18 January 2011. Despite this goalscoring run, Luton opted not to extend Atieno's contract. He was released on 31 January. On 11 February 2011, Atieno signed for League Two side Stevenage, and made his debut the next day, starting in their 1–0 away loss at Shrewsbury Town. It was to be Atieno's only appearance during Stevenage's 2010–11 campaign, and he was released by the club in May 2011 when his contract expired. Ahead of the 2011–12 season, Atieno went on a two-week trial with League Two side Torquay United. He scored in the club's first pre-season friendly, scoring from the penalty spot in a 2–1 win against Tiverton Town on 13 July 2011. Three days later, Atieno scored again in Torquay's 2–0 victory over Championship side Bristol City. He signed a one-year contract with Torquay on 25 July 2011, with manager Martin Ling stating -- \\"He has impressed us while he's been here and we've put in a contract that we feel is right\\". Atieno made his competitive debut for Torquay in the club's first game of the 2011–12 campaign, coming on as a 68th-minute substitute in a 2–2 draw at home to Burton Albion. A week later, Atieno scored his first goal for the club in a 2–1 win away at Bristol Rovers, finishing sharply on the turn. He was also awarded a penalty, which Rene Howe scored, for Torquay's second goal in the same match. On 13 and 17 May 2012, with Rene Howe injured, Taiwo was subbed on for the first leg of the play-off semi finals however failed to score. Similarly in the second leg he was subbed on however he did bag a goal, which only proved to be a consolation goal as Torquay United were beaten at home 2–1. Taiwo was released at the end of the season. On 26 December 2012, Atieno signed for Barnet. He made his debut as a 90th-minute substitute in a 2–2 draw away at Exeter City,Exeter 2 - 2 Barnet and scored his first goal in a 2–0 home win over Bradford City.Barnet 2 - 0 Bradford Atieno left the club by mutual consent on 1 February 2013.Taiwo Atieno leaves Barnet International career In January 2009 Atieno declared his desire to play for the Kenya national football team, telling a reporter for the Kenyan newspaper Daily Nation \\"It has been my dream to play for Kenya since I was 13\\". After Kenya's immigration minister stated that Atieno had to renounce his British citizenship before he could be granted a Kenyan passport, this seemed unlikely. Though reports the following day suggested he had received his passport and could play in the World Cup qualifier against Tunisia, this appeared not to have been the case. He made his debut as a late substitute in the June 2009 qualifier against Mozambique, played the whole of a friendly defeat in Bahrain, was again a substitute in the second qualifier against Mozambique, and played 46 minutes in the 1–0 qualifying loss to Tunisia. On 29 February 2012, Atieno returned to the international side after three years away, gaining his fifth cap, coming on as an 85th-minute substitute in a 2–1 win over Togo in 2013 Africa Cup of Nations qualification.

The species feeds by diving in deep waters, eating krill and a variety of small marine animals. It nests in dense colonies of up to 1 million individuals in the Bering Sea and the Sea of Okhotsk. It often breeds in mixed-species colonies with the least auklet, a smaller congener. The species is known for its sexual ornaments, found in both males and females. These include colorful plumage with a forehead crest, a striking scent recalling citrus fruit, and a loud trumpet call, all of which appear to have evolved through sexual selection. The total population is around 6 million, almost half in North America. It is in general considered to be of least concern, though the Alaskan population faces additional threats from predation and oil spills. Taxonomy The crested auklet was first described as Alca cristatella in 1769 by the German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas. The specific epithet cristatella is New Latin for \\"little crested\\" from Latin cristatus \\"crested\\" or \\"plumed\\". It is now placed in the genus Aethia that was introduced by the German naturalist Blasius Merrem in 1788. The genus includes four auklet species. There are no recognised subspecies of the crested auklet. Within the genus. it is most closely related to the whiskered auklet (A. pygmaea). The family Alcidae consists of many species of shorebirds including other auklets (not in the genus Aethia), puffins, razorbills, guillemots, and murres. Description Pair The crested auklet can measure in length, in wingspan and weigh .CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses by John B. Dunning Jr. (Editor). CRC Press (1992), . They have a reddish-orange and yellow tipped bill, yellowish white irises, and white auricular plumes from their eyes to their ears. Their bodies, wings, and tails are primarily dark sooty grey, while their legs and feet are grey and claws black. The males and females are very similar, although the females have slightly smaller and less curved bills, additionally slightly smaller crests. Crested auklets are known for their forehead crests, which is made of black forward-curving feathers. These forehead crests are highly variable, and can have between two and twenty three narrow forward curving feathers. The average auklet has 12 crest feathers, which are of variable length, between 8.1 and 58.5 millimetres. Auklets have auricular plumes and a bright orange bill with curved accessory plates. Like forehead crests, these features vary widely within auklet populations. The crested auklet is recognized primarily by two characteristics during the breeding season. The first is its crest, a group of bristle feathers located on top of its head above its eyes. The second is a social odor that the auklets produce during the breeding season, described as smelling like tangerines. This odor originates from tiny wick feathers, located in a small patch of skin between the shoulder blades. In winter plumage, their bills are smaller and dull yellow. They lack accessory plates and their crest and auricular plumes are reduced. Juveniles are similar to winter adults, but without auricular and crest plumes. Their bills are smaller, and colored a dull brownish yellow. Juveniles take 33 days to reach adult size. Distribution and habitat Crested auklets on a cliffside Crested auklets are found throughout the northern Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea. They are particularly prevalent during the non-breeding winter months along the Aleutian Islands, Kuril Islands and the Russian island of Sakhalin. They travel to breeding locations on the islands and shorelines of the Sea of Okhotsk and the Bering Sea during the late spring and summer. Their habitats consist of slopes, boulder fields, lava flows, and sea cliffs. They are often found with other auklet species such as the least auklet. On a daily basis, crested auklets circle 500 meters above the sea and the breeding colonies. This circling is triggered by disturbances and predators posing a threat. Behavior and ecology =Diet= Crested auklets primarily forage in deep waters, however sometimes in areas closer to the shore, but always in large flocks. Little is known about the winter diets, however, it is suggested that they feed on a variety of marine invertebrates. Crested auklets are planktivores. Their diet consists mainly of krill, but they are also known to eat copepods, pteropods (such as Limacina), amphipods and larval fishes. Crested auklets dive from the surface of the water to catch their food. This behavior has been described as underwater \\"flight\\". =Breeding and parental care= Chick in hand The crested auklet breeding season begins mid-May and ends mid-August. Their nesting sites are within the rocky crevices of North Pacific coast. They breed in dense colonies of up to one million birds. Because of this, nesting sites are in close proximity, with as little as 0.3 meters between nests. Even so, there is a high degree of territoriality, and adults show a high degree of site fidelity within a year. Because mating occurs at sea and males have no copulatory organ, males must hover over females for a successful mating. Mate choice is mutual, but females do have final choice on breeding partner. Crested auklets are highly social during the breeding season, before pair formation, and after pair formation. Within a breeding year, however, crested auklets are monogamous, with only 10% of the population having extra-pair copulations. Partners continue to self- advertise to other birds when they are not incubating. While some of this advertising behavior can be linked to extra-pair mating, it is suggested that continuation of the behavior allows birds to find pairs for the next breeding season. Only 45.5% of birds remain with the same partner in the subsequent breeding season. Both sexes invest highly in parental care; parents share equally in incubating the single egg and raising the chick. Since both sexes are ornamented, crested auklets align with Robert Trivers's parental investment theory, which predicts that with biparental care, mutual choosiness will arise. =Sexual selection= Crested auklets are unique in their use of optical, vocal, and olfactory signals in mating. Their communicative behavior is more complex and diversified than that of closely related species. There are three general evolutionary mechanisms proposed to address the origin of the elaborate display traits of crested auklets, and of showy mating signals by males in general: *Runaway selection: Fisher's theory of runaway sexual selection explains flamboyant traits in males as resulting from a genetic linkage between ornamental traits and a mating preference for such ornaments. Under this model, mating preferences could be spread by arbitrary or even deleterious traits that carry no benefits to fitness, besides sexual selection. *The good genes hypothesis: The second mechanism is the good genes or handicap processes, where mating preference focuses on ornamental traits that reflect the health or viability of the individual expressing them. These good genes convey genetic benefits to the offspring. Amotz Zahavi proposed the handicap hypothesis, where he suggests that individuals’ ornamental traits are indicators of good fitness, because they reflect the individual's success in spite of these traits as handicaps. *Sensory exploitation: The third proposed mechanism is sexual selection for sensory exploitation, which results in mating preferences that arise due to natural selection for inherent sensory biases. Mutations occur that result in a display trait which exploits the pre- existing sensory bias. =Ornamentation= Visual ornaments Illustration from 1913 Asserted dominance, with regards to claimed display area, has been correlated with crest length in both males and females. The existence of these showy monomorphic traits is indicative of intense sexual selection for both sexes. Large-crested adults of both sexes receive higher levels of sexual interest and displays from the opposite sex compared to those with smaller crests. Crested auklets with larger crests are more likely to obtain mates and to form pair bonds earlier. Based on divorce rate and mortality, more than half of individuals find a new mate each year. Female crest length is the primary factor of male mate switching between years. While there is variation in displays across populations, crested auklet crests and plume ornaments are consistent in expression within an individual over time. Furthermore, there is little sexual dimorphism or evidence of condition dependence. From studies, it seems to be a survival-neutral ornament. Some studies, however, offer up a functional purpose for these ornaments. One study suggests a link between habitat complexity and facial feathering, where tactile facial elongation helps individuals navigate complex underground crevices. The high density of crested auklet nesting sites can be expected to impose selective pressures on sensory mechanisms. Vocal ornaments Crested auklets have a wide variety of single and complex calls. Billing is \\"defined as pair courtship with mutual cackling vocal display.\\" It is a crucial part of successful pair formation and becomes harmonious once male and female partners are well acquainted. Trumpet calls are one of the most common advertising calls. The call represents a complex but stereotyped vocal sequence that is linked with a specific visual display. Between individuals, the calls differ in duration and frequency. Calls are primarily performed in males, but can also be seen in females. The call is particularly strong in widowed females. These calls stay stable from year to year, and individuals' specific calls are associated with the maintenance of long-term social bonds between pair mates and between neighbors. This suggests that trumpet calls can be used for both short-term and long-term individual recognition. Recognition of neighboring individuals' calls is advantageous because it minimizes energy expenditure on aggressive displays, and prevents conflict between neighbors and trusted individuals (the \\"dear enemy phenomenon\\"). Olfactory ornaments Crested auklets have a distinctive citrus-like plumage odor. The scent is released when there is ruffling of feathers on the nape and upper back of the individual from threat, trumpeting, or billing displays. The cloud of scent released encourages the ruff sniff display. A ruff sniff display is when birds fully insert their half open bill into the other's plumage. This display occurs in the absence of obvious aggression and is important for pair formation. For both sexes, a strong odor attracts more individuals, which then do a ruff sniff display. Odor secretions increase during the breeding season, highlighting its association with courtship and mate selection. The scent may also act as an ectoparasite repellent. This scent is also found in whiskered auklet. Conservation status Specimen covered in oil after the MV Selendang Ayu oil spill According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, crested auklets are of least concern. The global population exceeds 8.2 million individuals, while the North American population is estimated at 2.9 million birds. However, an accurate assessment of the number of birds is difficult, since those on the surface of the colony and in the nearby sea form only a small proportion of the variable and poorly understood population. There is greater concern for the Alaskan population. There has been high predation by rats which have escaped from fishing vessels in the harbor. The auklets' main predators are gulls, Arctic fox and common ravens. They have also been reported in the stomachs of halibut caught on St. Lawrence Island. Oil spills and collisions with light sources pose additional risks. In Alaska, there is some subsistence hunting of the species.

He is most noted for his television work, particularly his early 1960s collaborations with the playwright David Mercer, much of whose early work Taylor directed for the BBC. The BBC Born in Marylebone in London, Taylor attended Chiswick Grammar School and subsequently studied English Literature at Pembroke College, Oxford. While at university he became actively involved in student theatre, particularly with the Experimental Theatre Club. It was for the club that Taylor directed, in 1957, the world premiere of Epitaph for George Dillon by the acclaimed playwright John Osborne. After graduating, he joined the BBC as a general trainee in 1960, quickly becoming a television director in the drama department. His first directing work was an episode of the crime series Scotland Yard, but he rapidly became more associated with directing single plays. His association with David Mercer began in 1961 with Where the Difference Begins, the first instalment in what became the \\"Generations\\" trilogy, the subsequent instalments of which – A Climate of Fear (1962) and Birth of a Private Man (1963) – were also directed by Taylor. He also directed Mercer's Sunday Night Play episode A Suitable Case for Treatment (1962), which explored the writer's experiences of his own nervous breakdown. Taylor was greatly displeased by the arrival in December 1962 of the Canadian producer Sydney Newman as the new Head of Drama at the BBC. He regarded Newman as an uncultured populist with no theatrical knowledge or background; Taylor himself felt that the BBC should be the \\"National Theatre of the Air\\". He also disliked Newman's restructuring of the drama department, one of the features of which was the abolition of the BBC's traditional single producer/director role and the division of responsibilities of producing and directing to separate posts. Newman attempted to work with Taylor and offered him the producer's role on a series the Canadian himself had initiated – an educational science-fiction serial for children entitled Doctor Who. Taylor had no interest in the series. Taylor remained with the BBC for a time, but eventually in 1963 his unhappiness with the department under Newman drove him to resign from the corporation. Although he did return as a freelancer to direct two episodes of The Wednesday Play in 1965 – including a further Mercer play, And Did Those Feet? – he later claimed to have been \\"blacklisted\\" from working in the BBC's drama department for the remainder of the decade, and there is a deal of evidence to show that this was the case. Taylor himself quoted Lionel Harris as confirming this to Ellen Dryden in his memoir Days of Vision. Later career He was, however, able to find work with other departments of the BBC, directing several episodes of the arts documentary series Omnibus. He also began to find success as a playwright himself, for the theatre, with his first professional play Grounds for Marriage being premiered by the Traverse Theatre in 1967. From the early 1970s, he also began to work for BBC television drama again directing versions of his own plays The Exorcism in 1972, and The Roses of Eyam the following year. He also worked in television for the ITV network, including two episodes of Nigel Kneale's ATV anthology horror series Beasts in 1976. He went on to direct mostly classic theatrical adaptations for the BBC, including The Two Gentlemen of Verona in 1984 for their The Complete Dramatic Works of William Shakespeare series, which adapted all of Shakespeare's plays for the small screen. In 1986 he directed Oedipus Rex (Oedipus the King). His final television work was his own new translation of Iphigenia at Aulis by Euripides in 1990, after which he retired from the medium. That same year he published a memoir of his television work, Days of Vision, in which he was scathing of the state of modern television drama and the disappearance of the theatrical tradition from the medium. For the remainder of his career, Taylor was particularly active in radio and the theatre. The same year that he retired from television work, he and his wife established a radio production company called First Writes, producing plays independently for transmission on BBC radio. He both wrote and directed for radio himself, as well as working alongside his wife in the running of a youth theatre company they had established near their Chiswick home. He wrote a number of plays for the company, including \\"Daughters of Venice\\". Later in life, the family moved to the village of Banham, near Norwich, in Norfolk, where Taylor died in 2003. He had married the writer Ellen Dryden in 1960 – she and their two children survived him. Less than a year after his death, Katie Mitchell directed a production of his translation of Iphigenia at Aulis at the Lyttelton, to huge critical acclaim. The \\"National Theatre of the Air\\" had not come to pass, but finally his work was played at the National Theatre. This was followed in 2007 by the same director's production of his translation of Women of Troy, and in 2012 by Polly Findlay's production of his 'Antigone', with Christopher Eccleston and Jodie Whittaker.

History Up until the end of the 19th century, Rabac was a small fishing village. British explorer Richard Francis Burton visited the village in 1876 and mentioned it his book The Seaboard of Istria. The first summer mansion was built at that time by the Prohaska family but got later destroyed during World War II. The first hotel in Rabac, named Quarnaro, was opened on 11 June 1889. Hotels Three major hotels and a camping site are situated on the first beach. Along the 'Riva' apartments are available for rent. Along the second beach and Girandella countless hotels are situated, of particular note, the locally famous Albona hotel. Tourist activity Regular music concerts are held at Rabac beach and in the hotels. Magic shows at night are prevalent as are comedians. Tourist expeditions to Venice, Dubrovnik and Krka are common and operate daily at 1 and 3 pm. Fishing tours are also common and cost about 100 kuna.

Following in this tradition, Nixon's aggressive stance in Mesopotamia was not submitted for approval from London. It was approved in New Delhi, and that was enough. The advance into Mesopotamia met with initial success. The local Ottoman forces, mostly Arab troops under the overall command of Khalil Pasha in Baghdad and locally under Nur-Ud Din Pasha were not very well equipped nor experienced. As far as the Ottoman leader Enver Pasha was concerned, Mesopotamia was the least important campaign in the theatre, so the Caucasus, the Sinai, and the Dardanelles campaigns had priority when men and materiel were being allocated. From January 1915 until November, the British advanced up the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. The furthest advance was by General Townshend's 6th (Poona) Division which captured Kut on 26 September 1915. At this point, Townshend's forces were just about halfway between Basra and Baghdad and he wanted to call a halt. But in a rash of communications Nixon ordered a continuation of the expedition and so the 6th Poona division headed up river. By this time the Ottoman Army had brought a retired military expert into command - Baron von der Goltz - and sent experienced Turkish troops from Anatolia to defend Baghdad. General Nixon was sufficiently confident to embark with only his headquarters company and proceed upriver, hoping to be in Baghdad by Christmas. However, in late November, when news reached him that Townshend's forces had fought an inconclusive battle at Ctesiphon and were retreating to Kut, Nixon turned back towards Basra. His paddle steamer then came under attack from both sides of the river and ran aground. A sitting target, with only bales of straw around the deck for protection, casualties mounted until the Commander in Chief of Mesopotamia ran up a white flag and invited his attackers to parley. They turned out to be Arabs who had changed sides as the tide of war had turned the Turks' way. Nixon had to pay over a huge sum before he was allowed to continue to Basra. Everyone on board the steamer was treated to coffee but sworn to secrecy on pain of death.Eyewitness account of one Albert Maynard, who still believed in his eighties that he could be shot. Baron von der Goltz with his Ottoman army reached Kut a week behind the British. At this point, Townshend asked for permission to withdraw from Kut and, in another mistake, General Nixon refused. While Townshend's cavalry and some Royal Flying Corps assets were sent down the river, the vast majority of the 6th Poona Division stayed and dug in at Kut. Nixon had ordered transports and reinforcements from London. But by December 1915, the relief force was still in the Suez region. In three very specific memos Nixon expressed grave concerns at a worsening situation, and expressed deep urgency. The continuing prevarication and delay in Whitehall deliberating on the best course of action: was the threat that serious? Would one divisional reinforcement do, or would at least two be necessary? Nixon could not have known that almost all of Townshend's military communications were being intercepted by the enemy. Increasingly all sides of the British military establishment were operating with blinkers on. Nixon's apologists, that included the first historian of the Mesopotamian campaigns, Field Marshall Robertson, have pointed out that the War Office was undergoing extensive Imperial reorganization, amidst a critical time on the Western Front. The expedition had been authorized by the Viceroy of India in conjunction with the India Office. In future all military operations would be conducted by the joint commands of the War Office. The upheaval led to a change in the Imperial General Staff, and Cabinet war policy that had a delaying impact upon General Nixon's command.W.Robertson, \\"Mesopotamian campaigns\\" The issue of supplies for the defenders at Kut became critical. Once withdrawal became impossible, Major-General Townshend reported that he only had enough supplies for a month. In fact, his garrison held out for five months, though at reduced rations. The supply problem caused Nixon to rapidly gather his remaining divisions and launch a hasty effort to break the siege. The relief force, under the local command of Lieutenant-General Aylmer began its efforts in early January, 1916. They forced the Ottomans out of two fortified positions (Sheikh Sa'ad and Wadi) while suffering significant casualties. However, the Battle of Hanna was a complete failure. The British troops never even reached the Ottoman defensive positions at a loss of 2,700 casualties. Nixon had to take the blame for the looming disaster at Kut and the inability of his army to rectify the situation and so he was removed from command (officially it was due to ill-health). He was replaced by General Sir Percy Lake, who would also fail to rescue the garrison at Kut and be removed from command for his failure. The stress and fatigue became too great for Nixon himself. In the new year he had suffered a mental collapse, and in March 1916 asked to be retired from active duty. He returned to India. In 1917 an official commission reported on the failure at Kut. Nixon was found principally responsible for the failure of the Mesopotamian Expedition. This ended Nixon's military career and he died just four years later in 1921.First World War Biography Notes  Further reading   * External links *\\"The Indian Army of 1914\\" *Biography of Sir John Nixon *U.S. Military Academy map of the 1915 Campaign *U.S. Military Academy map of the Siege of Kut - Category:1857 births Category:1921 deaths Category:Indian Army generals of World War I Category:People educated at Rossall School Category:Graduates of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst Category:Knights Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George Category:Knights Commander of the Order of the Bath ","title":"John Nixon (Indian Army officer)"},{"id":"3936127","title":"Jay Wells"},{"id":"3936140","text":"Smokin' Aces is a 2006 dark comedy action thriller film written and directed by Joe Carnahan. The film centers on the chase for Las Vegas magician turned mafia informant Buddy \\"Aces\\" Israel (Jeremy Piven), on whom a one-million- dollar bounty is placed. The ensemble cast includes Ryan Reynolds, Ben Affleck, Jason Bateman, Common, Andy García, Alicia Keys, Taraji P. Henson, Ray Liotta, Chris Pine, and Matthew Fox, all co-starring as the various individuals attempting to either capture or protect Israel. Smokin' Aces was the official acting debut of Keys and Common. The film is set in Lake Tahoe and was mainly filmed at MontBleu Resort Casino & Spa, called the \\"Nomad Casino\\". It received generally mixed reviews, and was a commercial success. It was followed by a 2010 prequel, Smokin' Aces 2: Assassins' Ball, directed by P. J. Pesce and produced and co-written by Carnahan. Plot Las Vegas magician and wannabe gangster Buddy \\"Aces\\" Israel is hiding out in a Lake Tahoe hotel with his entourage. His agent, Morris Mecklen, discusses a potential immunity deal with FBI Deputy Director Stanley Locke. Agents Richard Messner and Donald Carruthers learn that ailing mob boss Primo Sparazza has issued a bounty on Israel worth one million dollars, and involving a mysterious assassin known only as The Swede, stipulating that he will bring Sparazza Israel's heart. A number of assassins also seek the reward, including Lazlo Soot, who specializes in disguises and impersonations; Sharice Watters and Georgia Sykes, two hitwomen hired by Sparazza's underboss; Pasquale Acosta, a calm torture expert and mercenary; and the psychotic neo-Nazi Tremor brothers, Darwin, Jeeves, and Lester. Locke dispatches Messner and Carruthers to take Israel into custody when the deal is struck. Meanwhile, a team of bail bondsmen, Jack Dupree and his partners, \\"Pistol\\" Pete Deeks and Hollis Elmore have been hired by the firm that posted Israel's bail to bring him into custody. The bondsmen are attacked by the Tremors, and only Elmore escapes alive. Messner is dispatched to the murder scene while Carruthers proceeds to Israel. At the same time, each of the assassins gain access to the hotel in their own various ways. Carruthers encounters Acosta, disguised as a security officer, in an elevator at the hotel. Carruthers senses something is wrong and both are mortally wounded in a gunfight. Meanwhile, Soot gains access to the penthouse by posing as one of Israel's henchmen. Israel's second-in-command, Sir Ivy, learns that Israel agreed to inform upon Ivy as part of the plea deal and attempts to kill him, but Israel injures Ivy long enough for the hotel security team to restrain him. Georgia finds Carruthers and Acosta in the elevator, but assumes Acosta is Soot. In Los Angeles, Locke abruptly withdraws from the deal with Israel and orders that Messner and Carruthers are not told. The Tremor brothers reach the penthouse floor, where they engage in a shootout with the security team and Ivy, who manages to kill Jeeves and Lester. Israel, learning of the FBI's new position, attempts suicide. Messner arrives at the hotel and sets up a position around Georgia's elevator. Sharice provides cover from another hotel with a .50-caliber, M82 sniper rifle, outgunning the FBI agents. Acosta, still alive, shoots Georgia, but is shot by Carruthers. Sharice, thinking Georgia is dead, refuses to escape and keeps shooting at the FBI team. Georgia escapes to the penthouse, where she stops Darwin Tremor before he can kill Ivy. Tremor escapes, and Messner, distraught over the death of Carruthers, stops Ivy and Georgia on the stairwell, but lets them escape. Sharice, after seeing the pair alive and free through her rifle scope, is gunned down by the FBI. Locke and a team of FBI agents descend on the penthouse and take Israel to the hospital, while Soot escapes by tearing off his disguise and dressing as a member of hotel security. Acosta, carted away on a gurney, is also shown to be alive. Darwin Tremor tries to escape, but is gunned down by Hollis Elmore. Messner arrives at the hospital and learns the truth about the day's events from Locke. It transpires that the mysterious Swede is a prominent heart surgeon and that Soot was hired by Sparazza to get Israel's heart so it could be transplanted into Sparazza's body. Sparazza is further revealed to be Freeman Heller, an FBI agent who went undercover and was thought to have been killed by the mob. But, in actuality, the FBI had attempted to kill Heller, after they thought his assignment had blurred the lines between being a mobster or an FBI agent. Heller survived, however, and ended up taking on the role as Sparazza full-time. The mobster has agreed to expose the mob's operations in exchange for Israel's heart as he is Sparazza's illegitimate son, thus, the most compatible donor. Messner, furious over the unnecessary deaths, especially Carruthers', protests and is ordered by Locke to leave the hospital and go home to Washington, D.C., as he is no longer on the case. Realizing that the FBI will never admit what they did, he walks into the emergency room, locks the door and pulls the plug on both Israel and Sparazza, killing them both. He then lays his gun and badge on the floor, apparently resigning from the FBI, while Locke and his men desperately try to break in.

Wayne Newton makes a cameo appearance as himself. Joe Carnahan, the film's writer-director, makes a cameo as an armed robber at the beginning of the film. Title sequence During the making of the film, Joe Carnahan's on-set photographer captured thousands of stills. These stills (over 3,000) were given to the London-based studio VooDooDog, who found sequential photographs that could be animated into title sequences. The images were then manipulated using After Effects giving control of camera movement and depth of field. The sequence takes inspirations from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and other 1970s movies. To give the rostrum type hand-made feel, ink textures were filmed using a Canon 5D stills camera. Originally two sequences were produced, an opening sequence and end sequence. However, only the end sequence was used. \\"Yes, Joe liked the opening credits we did but after their edit they felt it slowed the momentum of the introduction. That seems to be a big concern for filmmakers now—they're aware of the short attention span of audiences and don't want to delay the story. As a designer, I am not sure I would agree, of course. I think that if credit sequences are good and entertaining, they can hold an audience's attention\\". Soundtrack The movie itself contains 18 songs, leaving only one out of the official soundtrack which was \\"Spottieottiedopaliscious\\" by Outkast. The score music was composed by Clint Mansell who has also scored such movies as The Fountain and Requiem for a Dream. =Track listing= Release and reception =Box office= According to Box Office Mojo, the movie grossed $14,638,755 on its opening weekend (2,218 theaters, averaging $6,599 per theater).

The site's critical consensus reads, \\"A violent mess of a movie, Smokin' Aces has some of Quentin Tarantino's style but not much of his wit or humor\\". On Metacritic, the film has a score of 45 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". The film received praise for its cast, action sequences, and soundtrack, and criticism for its storylines and violence. David Denby of The New Yorker gave a negative review of the film, stating that it has \\"a rabid, itchy, crack-den heartlessness to it—screw-you nihilism as a joke\\" and \\"has been made with the kind of antic violence that wins a movie the honorific title of \\"black comedy.\\" What that indicates in this case is that nothing makes sense—and that's supposed to be cool.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film three out of four stars; although he noted that the film has \\"too many characters and too many plot strands\\" as well as an abrupt ending, he stated that the film is \\"shamelessly and unapologetically a guy movie... Carnahan can still fire up action and laughs like nobody's business.\\" During a rare talk session for Princeton University's series of film screenings in October 2016, director Terrence Malick praised the film, stating that it was \\"very well directed\\" and impressive in how it was able to balance numerous plotlines. =Home media= Smokin' Aces was released on DVD on April 17, 2007 and sold 1,853,397 DVD units which produced a revenue of $35,714,831, or more than double the movie's budget.

Jonathan Goforth became the foremost missionary revivalist in early 20th-century China and helped to establish revivalism as a major element in Protestant China missions. Goforth grew up on an Oxford County, Ontario, farm, the seventh of eleven children. As a young man he taught school in Thamesford, Ontario. Hearing fellow Oxford County native George Leslie Mackay, Presbyterian missionary to Taiwan, speak, he sensed a call from God to go to China. He attended University of Toronto, and Knox College, where he graduated in 1887, and was awarded the Doctor of Divinity in 1915. During his training, Goforth met Rosalind Bell-Smith at the Toronto Union Mission. She had been born in London, England, and had grown up in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. They married in 1887, in his final year at Knox, and eventually had eleven children, six of whom survived childhood. After initially subjecting him to teasing and even hazing, Goforth's classmates came to support him greatly in his quest to become an overseas missionary. Goforth had also read Hudson Taylor's book China's Spiritual Need and Claims, a book that he was so excited about that he ordered many copies of and mailed them to many pastors that he knew to promote missionary work in China. The Goforths were sent to pioneer the North Henan mission in 1888. Their work was difficult and they lost five of their eleven children to sickness. In 1900, the Goforths had to flee for many miles across China during the Boxer Rebellion. Jonathan was attacked and injured with a sword, but they both survived and escaped to the safety of one of the \\"Treaty Ports\\". The Goforths returned to Canada for a year. After their return to Henan in 1901, Jonathan Goforth felt increasingly restless. In 1904 and 1905 he was inspired by news of the great Welsh revival and read Charles Finney's \\"Lectures on Revivals\\". In 1907, circumstances brought him to witness firsthand the stirring Korean revival (\\"When the Spirit's Fire Swept Korea\\" [1943] represents his response). As Goforth returned to China through Manchuria, congregations invited him back in early 1908. During this extended visit there the \\"Manchurian revival\\" broke out. It was the first such revival to gain nationwide publicity in China as well as international repute. p.162 The revival transformed Goforth's life and ministry; from then on he was primarily an evangelist and revivalist, not a settled missionary. He also became one of the best known of all China missionaries, admired by many, but criticized by some for \\"emotionalism.\\" In 1925, he decided to remain within the Presbyterian Church in Canada, and his Henan station was transferred to the support of the United Church of Canada. He and Rosalind, despite their age and frailties, were then sent by the church to begin work in Manchuria, where they remained until Goforth's eyesight failed in 1935. He remained active into the 1930s, especially in Manchuria; in 1931 the Goforths coauthored \\"Miracle Lives of China\\". After his death in Toronto, Rosalind, a capable writer who had first published in 1920, wrote the popular \\"Goforth of China\\" (1937, with many reprints), and her own autobiography, \\"Climbing: Memories of a Missionary's Wife\\" (1940). Their final years in Canada were spent recounting their stories to many congregations. Goforth died at his son's manse in Wallaceburg, Ontario, after preaching the previous evening in nearby Wyoming, Ontario. The funeral service was held in Toronto's Knox Church, and Goforth is buried in the Mount Pleasant Cemetery in the same city.

Biography The band's history begins with brothers Andria and Ivan Busic forming their first bands, Platina (1984) and Cherokee (1988), respectively. At that time, guitarist Edu Ardanuy was already jamming with Busics eventually in São Paulo bars. In 1989, they performed as a backing band in recording the solo album of the recently outgoing guitarist of the band Rádio Táxi, Wander Taffo. Two years later, the band Taffo is formed, now no longer as a solo by Wander Taffo, but as a band. They record the beautiful CD Rosa Branca. As a guest, Andria goes on tour with the band Ultraje a Rigor. The Busic Brothers definitely invite Eduardo Ardanuy, who had previously played in bands such as Anjos da Noite and Chave do Sol. They become the backing band of vocalist Supla (ex-Tokyo). After a few shows, the trio decided it was time to invest in their own career. Already by the name of Dr. Sin, they travel to the United States to distribute and publicize their work, scheduling even some presentations. The band's first concert was on January 11, 1992 at the Black Jack in Sao Paulo. In February and March they do 3 shows in New York in the USA, in May open for Ian Gillan (Deep Purple) in Sao Paulo. In 1992, they signed a contract with the multinational Warner Music, which bet on the group, even without any material. In early 1993, the Hollywood Rock festival attracts thousands of fans of good old rock. Dr. Sin plays the same night as bands like Nirvana and L7. Also opened act for Pantera and at this same year, Warner releases the album Dr. Sin in 9 countries, having great repercussion. “Emotional Catastrophe” was a big hit on the music parades, presenting clips on MTV, and eventually became part of the soundtrack for TV Cultura's Brazilian TV series Confessions of Adolescents. “You Stole My Heart” and “Scream & Shout”, were the next videoclips released. The debut album is released on October 23, 1993. In 1994, they participated in numerous festivals, such as the M2000 Summer Concerts, which was a Festival held in the cities of Porto Alegre, Florianópolis and Santos, where they shared stage with bands like Mr. Big, The Lemonheads and Rollins Band. The festival Monsters of Rock (also participated in the 2013 edition), along with Slayer, Black Sabbath and Kiss. In July the band is headliner at Olympia Theatre in Sao Paulo. In 1995, the American MTV presented an 11 minutes interview with the band, with narration of the band's history and footage from their first album, clips, and shows in the US and Brazil. Brutal arrives the same year, released in Japan under the title of Silent Scream. The production this time was in charge of the band itself. In this album, it is possible to feel a great evolution in the band's sound, heavier and cohesive than the previous work. The album includes keyboardist Marcelo Souss (who had played with Busics at the time of the band Taffo) who also performed during the album's tour. A clip from “Down in The Trenches” is also recorded. In 1996, their success got them into a new opening marathon, opening act for Bon Jovi, Joe Satriani, Steve Vai and AC/DC. Andria and Ivan Busic participated in a fundraising campaign for the CACCC, which helps children with cancer. The video was recorded similar to Michael Jackson's 1980s campaign called USA for Africa. Other artists, such as Fábio Jr., Elba Ramalho, Sérgio Reis, Jair Rodrigues, Jair Oliveira, Luciana Mello and others, participated in the video. In July the band participates in the program of Jô Soares. In 1997's Insinity album, the trio returns to the United States to record at Michael Vescera Studios (former Yngwie Malmsteen) for the recording of the new album. Vescera co-produces the album, and participates in the track “No Rules”. Jonathan Mover (former drummer of Joe Satriani, Alice Cooper, Saigon Kick, Einstein) made a participation in the song “Insomnia”. Brazilian sports commentator Silvio Luiz collaborates with an irreverent participation in the song “Futebol, Mulher e Rock and Roll”, using the “football” jargon that made him popular. This song, together with “Emotional Catastrophe” becomes one of the greatest hits of the band. Once again the keyboards were recorded by Marcelo Souss. At the Skol Rock festival, where also played stars like Bruce Dickinson, Scorpions and Dio, the band makes a prodigious performance. In 1997, during the tour of the album Insinity, the keyboardist and friend of the band, Joey Gross Brown, plays in some shows, the partnership worked so well that shortly after he was already playing as a fixed guest musician, he stayed in the band from 97 until 2002. In April 98, the band plays in Curitiba, opening act for Quiet Riot. In May 98, the band opens act 3 shows for Swedish guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen, and that same year, they release an album of their performance called Live in Brazil. Malmsteen enjoyed the opening of the show so much that it included in its Japanese version an EP containing four tracks from Dr. Sin Live. In 2000, Vescera becomes a definitive member of the band and starts to share vocals with Andria. In quartet, they record the fourth self-titled album, Dr. Sin II. In a previously unheard of attitude in Brazil, the band releases this album in a magazine with the history of the band. This version could only be purchased at newsstands. The album was received by fans and critics in general, with fuss and admiration, as Vescera and his timbre fit the group's compositions perfectly. Also featuring Brazilian guitarist Sérgio Buss (Steve Vai, Tritone), Jason Himmelberger and Joey Gross Brown on keyboards and Roland Grapow (formerly Helloween). The song “Time After Time” was still the soundtrack of Fórmula Truck racing in Brazil, which was broadcast at the time on RedeTV! In mid-2001, vocalist Mike Vescera decides to leave the band because of the distance, he lived in the USA and it was difficult to come to Brazil constantly, at the end of 2002 another change, keyboardist Joey Gross Brown leaves and gives way to Rodrigo Simão which is officialized as a fixed guest keyboard player. 10 Years Live, released in late 2003, now on the Paradoxx Music label, are back again in a trio format. Recorded in May 2002 at SESC Ipiranga in São Paulo, it features the special participation of André Matos (former Shaaman, former Angra) in the song “Fire”. Marco Sergio on charango, Marco Cesar on percussion and keyboardists Joey Gross Brown and Marcelo Souss. In 2005, the album Listen to the Doctors was released, with cover recordings of classic rock songs. All the tracks have the word \\"Dr.\\" in their title, like the cover of Kiss “Calling Dr. Love” and “Dr. Feelgood” of Mötley Crüe. After nearly two years promoting the cover CD Listen to the Doctors, Dr.Sin releases his new work, Bravo (2007). The album was first place on CD sales and remains one of the best sellers. This album has the track “Think it Over” which is the soundtrack of the soap opera Amor e Intrigas, and has a guest appearance by Hudson Cadorini of the duo Edson & Hudson, playing the guitar solo. In 2008, Andria Busic joins as official member of the new formation of the anthological national rock n 'roll band Casa das Máquinas, and they play at the Psicodália festival and at the Virada Cultural festival. It is this year that the band Shining Star records a version of Dr. Sin's song \\"Karma\\", thus becoming the first official record of one version by another band. Soon after, singer Twiggy included her version of the song “You Stole my Heart” from Dr. Sin's first album on her first CD, which featured versions of several other national and international artists such as Rita Lee, Cazuza, Carlos Carlos, LS Jack , George Harrison, Leoni and some own compositions in partnership with Andria Busic, Ivan Busic, Edu Ardanuy, Liah and Rodrigo Leal. That same year, the band was invited to be part of an official tribute to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Beatles White Album. This is the second time Dr. Sin has recorded a Beatles cover. Chamas da Vida, a new Rede Record soap opera, featured the soundtrack of the song \\"Fire\\" and \\"Full Throttle\\" from the albums Brutal and Bravo, respectively. This is the third time that Dr. Sin is a soap opera soundtrack, and a second at Record TV.

Company titles included detective, adventure, romance, and Western fiction. They were also known for the several 'weird menace' titles. They also published several pulp hero or character pulps. The company was formed in 1930 by Henry \\"Harry\\" Steeger. It was the time of the Great Depression, and Steeger had just read The Hound of the Baskervilles. Steeger realized that people wanted escapist fiction, allowing them to forget the difficulties of daily life. Steeger wrote \\"I realised that a great deal of money could be made with that kind of material. It was not long before I was at it, inventing one pulp magazine after another, until my firm had originated over 300 of them.\\" In the late 1930s Steeger was under pressure to lower his rate of pay to below one cent a word, which he felt was the minimum decent rate he could offer. He didn't want to have Popular pay less than one cent per word, so a new company, Fictioneers, was started; it was essentially a fictional company, with an address (205 East 42nd St) that corresponded to the rear entrance of Popular's offices at 210 East 43rd St. It was given a separate phone number, and the switchboard girl was instructed to put calls through to staff working on Fictioneers titles only if the calls came to the Fictioneers number. Many staff were working on magazines for both companies at the same time, which made it difficult to maintain the pretense of separation. Science fiction writer Frederik Pohl, on the other hand, was hired specifically to edit two Fictioneers titles: Astonishing Stories and Super Science Stories.Pohl, Early Pohl, pp. 23-24. In 1934, Popular acquired Adventure from the Butterick Company. Around the same time, the purchased a number of titles from Clayton Publications such as Ace-High Magazine and Complete Adventure Novelettes. In 1940, they purchased Black Mask from The Pro-Distributors, Inc. In 1942 the firm acquired the properties of the Frank A. Munsey Company In 1949, they acquired all of the pulp titles Street & Smith had recently cancelled, with the exceptions of The Shadow (due to the radio show) and their other hero pulps, and Astounding, although Popular did not publish revivals of them all. Other imprints used included Fictioneers, Inc. (1939–58), All-Fiction Field, Inc. (1942–58), New Publications, Inc. (1936–60), Recreational Reading (1936–60), and Post Periodicals, Inc. (1936–60). In 1972, the company was sold to Brookside Publications, a company owned by advertising magnate David Geller. At the time it was still publishing Argosy, Railroad, recently ending Adventure and True Adventure. A handful of years later, Geller sold Popular to French publisher Hachette. In 1981, they sold the rights to Joel Frieman who established Blazing Publications, which in 1988 renamed itself Argosy Communications, Inc. Under those names, it published a few comic book version of characters, as well as allowed the reprinting of several of their properties. In 2014 most of its titles-including all copyrights and associated intellectual property-were acquired by Steeger Properties, LLC,http://www.steegerproperties.com/about-us/ with Argosy Communications retaining only a few pulp heroes such as The Spider, G-8, and Operator #5.

The band was formed in 1968 by Brian May, who went on to become Queen's guitarist. It included Tim Staffell as lead singer and bass guitarist, and later, drummer Roger Taylor, who also went on to play for Queen. They recorded only six songs and disbanded in 1970. These songs were titled \\"April Lady\\", \\"Step on Me\\", \\"Polar Bear\\", \\"Earth\\", \\"Blag\\", and \\"Doin' Alright\\" (later re-recorded by Queen for their self-titled debut album in 1973). These songs exist on the vinyl LP Ghost of a Smile. \\"April Lady\\" was dedicated to Roger Taylor's girlfriend at the time. History In 1968, Brian May, a student at London's Imperial College, and Tim Staffell formed a group when May placed an advertisement on the college notice board for a \\"Ginger Baker type\\" drummer, and a young dental student named Roger Taylor auditioned and got the job. Smile were signed to Mercury Records in 1969, and had their first experience of a recording studio in Trident Studios that year. Staffell was attending Ealing Art College with Farrokh (\\"Freddie\\") Bulsara, and introduced him to the band. Bulsara soon became a keen fan. The group's biggest public performance was on 27 February 1969 at the National Council for the Unmarried Mother and Her Child. Held at the Royal Albert Hall, May, Taylor and Staffell performed as a trio on guitar, drums and bass respectively. Keyboardist Chris Smith had been fired the day before, according to Staffell. (According to Smith, he was only briefly in the band and left on his own accord because he was interested in different styles.)\\"Smit's Smile\\". Originally from Queenfans.com. (Currently offline, retrieved through web archive on 2007-11-08.) Smile gigged quite a bit on the London scene, according to Time Out's listings. On 19 April, they played at the Speakeasy and on 31 May, appeared at the Whisky-A-Go-Go. In March 1969, the band played at a venue known as PJ's, using claims to have previously been played on BBC Radio 1 to secure an audience. It seems likely that the claims were fictitious, however. Shortly after they were given a one- off recording deal by Mercury Records to record three tracks, \\"Earth\\" (Staffell), \\"Step on Me\\" (May), and \\"Doin' All Right\\" (May/Staffell). These were recorded in June 1969 at Trident Studios in Soho. Ultimately this U.S. promotional recording was never published commercially, however, in September of the same year, Mercury Records commissioned them to record three more songs: \\"April Lady\\" (Stanley Lucas), \\"Blag\\", and \\"Polar Bear\\", a \\"gentle song about a polar bear\\" written and led by May, at De Lane Lea Studios. Again, the record was not released at the time. When Staffell left in 1970 to join another band, Humpy Bong, Smile effectively disbanded. Bulsara persuaded May and Taylor to continue, and at about the same time, changing his surname from Bulsara to Mercury, joined the band as lead vocalist, from which emerged \\"Queen\\". This new band tried a number of bass players during this period, namely Mike Grose, Barry Mitchell and Doug Bogie, none of whom fit with the band's chemistry. It was not until February 1971 that John Deacon completed the lineup, and they began rehearsing for their first album. This definitive lineup lasted until Mercury's death in 1991, their last album being Made in Heaven, released posthumously in 1995. For their debut album, Queen recorded \\"Doing All Right\\". According to the book Queen: The Early Years, Staffell has been well compensated through royalties from the sale of the album, given his co-songwriting credit for the song with May. Queen also recorded the song for their first BBC recording session with John Peel. That session, along with their third session, have been released in the UK as At the Beeb (Band of Joy Records) in 1989, and in the U.S. as Queen at the BBC (Hollywood Records) in 1995. Also in 1995, Queen issued their \\"Let Me Live\\" singles, one of which features three of the first session BBC recordings, including \\"Doing Alright\\". Smile reunited for several songs on 22 December 1992. Taylor's band The Cross were headliners and he brought May and Staffell on to play \\"Earth\\" and \\"If I Were a Carpenter\\".Tim Staffell Biography May also performed several other songs that night. In 2018, Smile reunited once more in Abbey Road to re-record \\"Doing All Right\\". This release was used in Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody movie. Discography Two legitimate releases of the six Smile tracks have since been issued: Gettin' Smile (LP) from Japan, released 23 September 1982, on Mercury Records. The sleeve contains notoriously inaccurate lyrics and songwriting credits for the songs. This release was used for all subsequent bootlegs which contain the songs. Ghost of a Smile (CD) from the Netherlands, released in 1997, on Pseudonym Records. The CD booklet is comprehensive and features new liner notes by Staffell. All the tracks were newly remastered. The album also features two versions of the Eddie Howell/Freddie Mercury collaboration \\"The Man from Manhattan\\" (no relation to Smile, except that May plays guitar on it). There is a bootleg album of their early tracks circa the Smile-era titled Pre-Ordained. Most of them also appeared on the 1995 Italian bootleg In Nuce.

It is centred west of Henley-on-Thames, north of Reading, Berkshire and southwest of Rotherfield Greys. The 2011 Census recorded the parish population as 1,649. The area includes Peppard Hill, which is west of the centre of the village and adjoins Sonning Common. Peppard Common is public woodland and meadow in between in a ravine. The far east of the parish is a golf course and the far west is Kingwood Common which is also wooded common land. In 1951, Elizabeth Goudgehttps://www.elizabethgoudge.org/ (1900-1984), novelist and winner of the Newberry Award for Best Children's Book (The White Horse), moved to Rotherfield Peppard, where she lived until her death. A blue plaque, unveiled in 2008, identifies her home.http://oxonblueplaques.org.uk/plaques/goudge.html Toponym Rotherfield derives from the Old English redrefeld meaning \\"cattle lands\\". In the middle of the area is the open-to-the-public land, Peppard Common, once used for grazing and which can be used by parishioners for small timber. Church and chapel The Church of England parish church of All Saints was Norman, but was almost completely rebuilt in 1874. All Saints' is a Grade II* listed building. The ecclesiastical parish has become part of the united benefice of Rotherfield Peppard, Kidmore End and Sonning Common. Providence Chapel was founded in 1795. It later became Peppard Congregational Church. It is now Springwater Congregational Church. Social and economic history Blount's Court is an early 19th-century house with neoclassical features, including a 15th-century doorway and 16th-century panelling. It was the childhood home of Francis Knollys, 1st Viscount Knollys and is now the Johnson Matthey Technology Centre. Wyfold Court was designed by Somers Clarke and built in 1872–78 for the Lancashire cotton magnate and Conservative politician Edward Hermon (1822–81). It is a Grade II* listed building. Early in the 20th century a local man, Bert Butler, operated a bus business called the Peppard and District Motor Service. This seems to have ceased operating in the First World War. In April 1918 the Reading Branch of British Automobile Traction (BAT) started a bus service between Peppard Common and Reading on a trial basis using petrol-engined buses. This was short-lived due to wartime petrol rationing and was discontinued in May 1918. BAT later reinstated the service, and from October 1919 extended it to Stoke Row. Reading Buses Pink 25 route now serves Peppard Common. Peppard Cottage was used as filming location for \\"Howards End\\" The village has thrice been used for settings in the television drama series Midsomer Murders and also for many of the scenes (including the eponymous house) in the Merchant Ivory Productions film Howards End. There was formerly a Peppard Football Club that played in the Combined Counties Football League in the 1990s and Hellenic Football League in the early 2000s until it disbanded.

Spectrochemical series of ligands The spectrochemical series was first proposed in 1938 based on the results of absorption spectra of cobalt complexes. A partial spectrochemical series listing of ligands from small Δ to large Δ is given below. (For a table, see the ligand page.) I− < Br− < S2− < SCN− (S–bonded) < Cl− < N3− < F−< NCO− < OH− < C2O42− < O2−< H2O < acac− (acetylacetonate) < NCS− (N–bonded) < CH3CN < gly (glycine) < py (pyridine) < NH3 < en (ethylenediamine) < bipy (2,2'-bipyridine) < phen (1,10-phenanthroline) < NO2− (N–bonded) < PPh3 < CN− < CO Weak field ligands: H2O, F−, Cl−, OH− Strong field ligands: CO, CN−, NH3, PPh3 Ligands arranged on the left end of this spectrochemical series are generally regarded as weaker ligands and cannot cause forcible pairing of electrons within the 3d level, and thus form outer orbital octahedral complexes that are high spin. On the other hand, ligands lying at the right end are stronger ligands and form inner orbital octahedral complexes after forcible pairing of electrons within 3d level and hence are called low spin ligands. However, it is known that \\"the spectrochemical series is essentially backwards from what it should be for a reasonable prediction based on the assumptions of crystal field theory.\\"7th page of http://science.marshall.edu/castella/chm448/chap11.pdf This deviation from crystal field theory highlights the weakness of crystal field theory's assumption of purely ionic bonds between metal and ligand. The order of the spectrochemical series can be derived from the understanding that ligands are frequently classified by their donor or acceptor abilities. Some, like NH3, are σ bond donors only, with no orbitals of appropriate symmetry for π bonding interactions. Bonding by these ligands to metals is relatively simple, using only the σ bonds to create relatively weak interactions. Another example of a σ bonding ligand would be ethylenediamine; however, ethylenediamine has a stronger effect than ammonia, generating a larger ligand field split, Δ. Ligands that have occupied p orbitals are potentially π donors. These types of ligands tend to donate these electrons to the metal along with the σ bonding electrons, exhibiting stronger metal-ligand interactions and an effective decrease of Δ. Most halide ligands as well as OH− are primary examples of π donor ligands. When ligands have vacant π* and d orbitals of suitable energy, there is the possibility of pi backbonding, and the ligands may be π acceptors. This addition to the bonding scheme increases Δ. Ligands that do this very effectively include CN−, CO, and many others. Spectrochemical series of metals The metal ions can also be arranged in order of increasing Δ, and this order is largely independent of the identity of the ligand.http://www.everyscience.com/Chemistry/Inorganic/Crystal_and_Ligand_Field_Theories/b.1013.php Mn2+ < Ni2+ < Co2+ < Fe2+ < V2+ < Fe3+ < Cr3+ < V3+ < Co3+ In general, it is not possible to say whether a given ligand will exert a strong field or a weak field on a given metal ion. However, when we consider the metal ion, the following two useful trends are observed: *Δ increases with increasing oxidation number, and *Δ increases down a group.

Planning for the area began in 1960s with Forest City Enterprises, a Cleveland real estate company and the powerful Buchholzer family, whose previous endeavors involved financing much of the Chapel Hill Mall area. Despite warnings by civic leaders and former Mayor Edward O. Erickson that the addition of a third mall in the Akron area would harm downtown department stores, the Rolling Acres area was born with Rolling Acres Mall serving as its anchor. Pulling from a diverse population of blue collar workers in Barberton, Ohio and Kenmore, and inner city neighborhoods such as West Akron and Lane-Wooster, the Rolling Acres shopping district blossomed. At its peak it was the most visited mall in Northeast Ohio. Today, Rolling Acres stands as a skeleton of what it once was, mirroring many other parts of the Midwest that have suffered from stagnant economic conditions, saturated markets, and unprofitable foot traffic. The shopping district is located in the City of Akron proper, and encompasses most of the area.

It is the only member of the genus Medusagyne of the tropical tree and shrub family Ochnaceae. The plant, thought to be extinct until a few individuals were found in the 1970s, gets its common name from the distinctive jellyfish-like shape of its dehisced fruit. Description They are small trees which can reach up to tall and have a dense rounded crown of foliage. The bark is dark and has many distinctive, deep fissures. The leaves are shiny and leathery in appearance with a slightly scalloped edge; they turn bright red with age. Leaves are up to in length. The small white flowers are difficult to see amongst the dense foliage; male and bisexual flowers are carried on the drooping inflorescence. The generic name Medusagyne was given to the plant by John Gilbert Baker who thought that the gynoecium of the flower resembles the head of Medusa from Greek mythology. Baker did not have the dehisced fruit, which resembles a larval hydrozoan or jellyfish, so he did not base the generic name on this resemblance; the vernacular name, jellyfish tree, was applied later possibly based on the appearance of the dehisced fruit and the coincidence that the word medusa is also used to describe the free-floating umbrella-shaped form of jellyfish.Robertson, Ann, Rosemary Wise, and Frank White. 1989. Medusagyne oppositifolia. Curtis's Botanical Magazine, 6: 166–171. doi: 10.1111/j.1467-8748.1989.tb00650.x This plant exhibits many adaptations to dry climate, strange on a moist archipelago. It can withstand drought, and its seeds disperse by the wind. This suggests it has Gondwanan origins. The fruits are green and rounded; the outer coat becomes reddish- brown with maturity and then dries, exposing the seeds within, which are then distributed by the wind. Classification The genus Medusagyne is in the family Ochnaceae, e.g. in the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification, though it is sometimes in the monogeneric family Medusagynaceae. The small tropical American family Quiinaceae is also included in this broad concept of Ochnaceae.Fay, M. F., Swensen, S. M. & Chase, M. W. (1997). Taxonomic affinities of Medusagyne oppositifolia. Kew Bulletin 52: 111-120. Habitat The tree inhabits exposed granite slopes, at present all locations are within of the sea. Threats The jellyfish tree presents a conundrum in that the seeds seem unable to germinate in the wild; no young plants have been observed in the natural stands. Successful cultivation in botanic gardens has occurred in very humid conditions, but high humidity is unlikely in the exposed habitat where these trees are found in the wild. It has been suggested that jellyfish trees have been lost from the more appropriate habitat of moist forests through competition with other species and climate change. Conservation Three of the existing populations of jellyfish tree on the island on Mahé (Bernica, Copolia and Mt. Jasmin) are protected within the Morne Seychellois National Park. Although seedlings have been grown in a number of botanic gardens, many problems remain and a conservation priority must be further research into the reproductive biology of this intriguing species before any effective Action Plan for its future can be devised.

Retrieved 3 December 2018.) was an English cellist best known for his membership of the Electric Light Orchestra (ELO) and related acts. Career McDowell started playing the cello at the age of four-and-a-half; by the age of 10, he had won a scholarship to the Yehudi Menuhin School. Only one year later he made his first professional appearance in Benjamin Britten's The Turn of the Screw, in which he sang. Later he attended Kingsway College of Further Education, the Royal College of Music and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. He played with the London Youth Symphony Orchestra, the London Schools Symphony Orchestra, National Youth Orchestra and London Youth Chamber Orchestra, until he was persuaded by Wilf Gibson to join The Electric Light Orchestra. =Electric Light Orchestra career= McDowell performed with the first live line-up of ELO in 1972 while only 19 years old, but left with founding member Roy Wood and horn player/keyboardist Bill Hunt to perform with the group Wizzard. During his time in Wizzard, he played both cello and Moog synthesizer, but returned to ELO in 1973 to replace Colin Walker. McDowell's return was partly motivated by a desire to play more cello and less keyboards as he had done with Wizzard. He remained with the group until Jeff Lynne removed the string players from the line-up. McDowell appeared in promotional videos for the Discovery album, despite not having played on the record. He performed with Electric Light Orchestra Part II in 1991. =Post-ELO life= In 1980, McDowell played on the album Gift Wrapped by former ELO cellist Melvyn Gale, who had founded the group Wilson Gale & Co.. That autumn he began teaching part-time at the musical instrument technology department of a London higher educational college, the London College of Furniture, now part of the Guildhall University. He conducted a children's orchestra and other orchestras at several London schools. For a short time, around 1982, he was a member of Radio Stars and recorded the single \\"My Mother Said\\" with the group. McDowell was a member of the 20th-century chamber groups George W. Welch, Harmonie Band and Quorum. He joined the Cornelius Cardew Ensemble, a contemporary music group, in 1995. More recently he worked on the 2004 Simon Apple album River to the Sea, on the 2005 Saint Etienne album Tales from Turnpike House, the 2005 Wetton Downes album Icon and appeared as a guest artist on the 2007 Port Mahadia album, Echoes in time. He also played cello on Asia's 2008 album Phoenix, on \\"An Extraordinary Life\\" and \\"I Will Remember You\\". McDowell also arranged and recorded for numerous pop, rock and jazz-fusion albums, as well as collaborating in dance, film, and theatre projects. He was involved with computer programming, and published a music composition program called Fractal Music Composer in 1992. He developed a suite of four programs: Mandelbrot Set Composer, Julia Set Composer, Mandelbrot Zoom and Play Midi. Death McDowell died of cancer on 6 November 2018.

Along with Brazilian artists Amilcar de Castro, Franz Weissmann, Lygia Pape and poet Ferreira Gullar, Clark co-founded the Neo-Concrete movement. From 1960 on, Clark discovered ways for viewers (who would later be referred to as \\"participants\\") to interact with her art works.

During Brazil's military dictatorship, Clark self-exiled to Paris, where in the 1970s she taught art classes at the Sorbonne. During this time, Clark also explored the idea of sensory perception through her art. Her art became a multi-sensory experience in which the spectator became an active participant. Between 1979 and 1988, Clark moved toward art therapy, using her objects in interactive sessions with patients. In 1977, Clark returned to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and she died of a heart attack in her home in 1988.  Influences Clark's early works were influenced by the Constructivist movement and other forms of European geometric abstraction, including the work of Max Bill, though she soon departed from the rationalism and idealism of much abstract art. Clark's early work reflected her interest in psychoanalysis, including the research of Sigmund Freud. She drew on the writings of French philosopher Maurice Merleau- Ponty, whose phenomenology resonated with the intertwining of subject and object she sought in her breakthrough work of the 1960s. Later in her career, her more holistic works displayed influences from experiences she had with psychotic and neurotic patients. Like many intellectuals of the 1950s and 60s, Clark was in therapy herself, and the propositions she was developing explored the frontier between art, therapy, and life.  Tropicália artistic movement Clark is one of the most established artists associated with the Tropicália movement. Clark explored the role of sensory perception and psychic interaction that participants would have with her artwork. An example of Clark's fascination with human interaction is her 1967 piece O eu e o tu (The I and the You). The piece consists of two industrial rubber suits joined together by an umbilical-like cord. The participants wearing the suits would be joined together but unable to see one another, forming an almost psycho- sexual bond between the two. Clark said of her pieces, \\"What's important is the act of doing in the present; the artist is dissolved into the world.\\"  Nostalgia of the Body  In 1964, Clark began her Nostalgia of the Body series with the intention of abandoning the production of art objects in order to create art that was rooted in the senses. The Nostalgia of the Body works relied on participant's individual experiences occurring directly in their bodies. These pieces addressed the simultaneous existence of opposites within the same space: internal and external, metaphorical and literal, male and female.  Art therapy  Art critic Guy Brett observed that Clark \\"produced many devices to dissolve the visual sense into an awareness of the body.\\" Clark's later works focused heavily on the unconscious senses: touch, hearing and smell. In her 1966 work, Breathe With Me, Clark formed a rubber tube into a circle and invited participants to hold the tube next to their ear. The participants could hear the sound of air entering and exiting the tube, which produced an individual sensory experience for each participant.  Stylistic periods  During the early part of Clark's career, she focused on creating small monochromatic paintings which were done in black, gray, and white.Brett Guy, \\"Lygia Clark: In Search of the Body,\\" Art in America (July 1994): During the 1960s, her work became more conceptual and she used soft objects that could be manipulated by the art spectator. Clark later moved on to co-found the Neo-Concrete movement, which was joined by fellow Brazilian Hélio Oiticica. Throughout her career, Clark's art has involved an exploration of art's effect on spectators. One of her primary goals as an artist was to appeal to the average, everyday person, not just the bourgeois crowd. In the late 1950s, Clark and some of her contemporaries broke away from the Concrete group to start the Neo-Concrete movement. They published their manifesto in 1959. Helio Oiticica would soon join the group in the next year. The Neo- Concretists believed that art was a matter of the subject's experience in real time and space, but unlike the Minimalists in the U.S. who had some similar interests, Clark and the Neo-Concretists equated 'real space' with liveliness and the organic. In Clark’s writings, she articulates that an artwork should not be considered \\"a ‘machine’ nor an ‘object,’ but rather, an almost-body\\" which can only be made whole through viewer participation.Bois, Yve-Alain and Lygia Clark. \\"Nostalgia of the Body.\\" The MIT Press 69 (Summer 1994): 85-109. Clark and Oiticica fused modern European geometric abstraction art with a Brazilian cultural flavor. The Brazilian Neo-Concrete movement borrowed their artistic ideas from Max Bill who was the director of the Ulm School of Design in Germany during the early 1950s. One of the goals of this newest artistic group was to create worldly, modern art as opposed to the provincial style currently popular in Brazil. The Neo-Concretists wanted art to be intuitive, yet expressive and subjective. The Neo-Concretists were interested in how art could be used to \\"express complex human realities.\\"Gullar, Ferreira. \\"Neo- Concrete Manifesto.\\" History of Modern Latin American Art Course Reader. Spokane: Whitworth University, 2014. They soon began making artworks the spectator could interact with physically, like Clark's Bichos (Critters), 1960-63, which are ingenious arrangements of hinged metal plates that can fold flat, or be unfolded into three dimensions and manipulated into many different configurations. Interacting with these works the spectator was meant to become more aware of his or her physical body and metaphysical existence. Viewer participation was essential for the artwork to be complete (in fact, Clark and Oiticica referred to the audience as \\"participants\\" rather than viewers. Clark described the exchange between viewer and Bicho as a dialogue between two living organisms. In addition, Neo-Concretists looked to push the limits of what art represented. For them, the art is the actual process of doing, and it is during this interaction that the spectator truly experiences what the artwork means. After the 1964 Brazilian coup d'état and the military dictatorship that took power in the fallout, a counterculture movement grew in response to the government's increasing scrutiny on the public. At this point in time, Institutional Act Number Five was enacted and artists were forced into exile or fled the country out of fear of persecution.Suely Rolnik, \\"The Body's Contagious Memory; Lygia Clark’s Return to the Museum,\\" translated by Rodrigo Nunes, Transversal (January 2007): http://eipcp.net/transversal/0507/rolnik/en Clark spent these years in Paris where she taught at the Sorbonne, UFR d’Arts Plastiques et Sciences de l’Art de l’Université de Paris 1, a newly founded school remarkable for its open, experimental model in contrast to the more traditional beaux-arts academy format. During the 1970s, Clark explored the role of sensory perception and psychic interaction that the participants would have with her artwork. She referred to this as \\"ritual without myth\\". For Clark, the artwork would have no representative meaning outside of its manipulation by the participants. Participants would take the art objects and fashion them in any way that they pleased. At this point, the line between the participant and artwork would become blurred. The participants would become one with the art piece. In a sense, the participant and artwork would become fused. In the final years of her career, Clark focused solely on psychotherapy and the use of art in healing patients. Clark's objective through her art was to surpass each phase since ideas that were originally considered groundbreaking were outdated with regard to her later works. Clark's later, more famous works were viewed as \\"living experiences,\\" a focus she had for three decades of her career.Simone Osthoff, \\"Lygia Clark and Helio Oiticica: A Legacy of Interactivity and Participation for a Telematic Future,\\" Leonardo, Vol. 30, No. 4. (1997), 279-289: She did not separate the mind from the body and believed that art should be experienced through all five senses. After 1963, Clark's work could no longer exist outside of a participant's experience. Her art became an interactive experience. She believed that a viewer, or \\"participant\\", served an active and important function in the art world. In most museums, works are affixed to a stand or on the wall, while Clark's works were meant to be manipulated by the viewer/participant. Her belief was that art should be a multi-sensory experience, not just one enjoyed through the eyes. At one point she wrote \\"We are the proposers: our proposition is that of dialogue. Alone we do not exist. We are at your mercy,\\" she then went on to say \\"We are the proposers: we have buried the work of art as such and we call upon you so that thought may survive through your action.\\" One of her most recognized interactive art pieces is Baba Antropofágica. This piece was inspired by a dream that Clark had about an anonymous substance that streamed out from her mouth. This experience was not a pleasurable one for Clark. She viewed it as the vomiting of a lived experience that, in turn, was swallowed by others. In a sense, Clark seemed to view this atrocity as a way of displaying its freedom. One of Clark's (and for that matter, Oiticica) aims was to create art directed toward a larger world audience, drawing attention toward its social issues thus achieving a sense of cultural freedom. For her interactive art pieces, Clark always used inexpensive everyday objects. These objects would then only have significance if they came into direct contact with a participant's body. In the latter part of her career, Clark focused more on art therapy and less on the actual creation of a work. When she returned to Rio de Janeiro in 1976, Clark's therapeutic focus rest upon the memory of trauma. When she changed her creative direction in 1971, she wrote \\"I discovered that the body is the house...and that the more we become aware of it the more we rediscover the body as an unfolding totality.\\" She wanted to uncover why the power of certain objects brought about a vivid memory in her psychotherapy patients so that she could treat their psychosis. Depending upon the individual, the sessions could be short-term or long-term, in which treatment came about through the relationship between the relationship object and how the participant interpreted its meaning.

She has starred in film, television, and theater across the United States, Mexico, and Spain. She has had popular and award-winning roles in works including Sex, Shame and Tears, Capadocia, Nos vemos, papá, and The House of Flowers. She has been honored with three lifetime achievement awards; she was the first woman to receive Mexico's lifetime achievement award in cinema. She was also the first Spanish-speaking actress to be nominated for an Emmy. Beyond campaigning against femicide, Suárez is also an activist for human rights and women's rights in Mexico and in Mexican media. Ignacio Sánchez Prado, an historian of Mexican cinema, writes that she has an \\"iconic status as an actress in Mexico's most successful movies\\".:152 Early life Suárez was born and raised in Tampico, a small coastal area in the northern Mexican state of Tamaulipas. She says that there was no theater there, and that her parents shielded her from too much play-acting as a child because \\"childhood was something to prolong and respect\\". She has three sisters, including the director Mafer Suárez; her father was Engino \\"Ben\\" and her mother is Ma̰ Elena. Suárez also has family from Asturias, Spain, and holds Spanish dual nationality from her grandfather, an Asturian who emigrated to Mexico. Career Suárez has said she never dreamed of being an actor. She moved to the United States in 1991 for university, attending Illinois State University; having intended to study law, she instead moved into theater, inspired by her older sister Mafer. She graduated as valedictorian of the theater program in 1995, receiving the Jean Scharfenberg Scholarship. As she left college, she also received the Steppenwolf Theatre Acting Fellowship Award, and her debut was at Chicago's Steppenwolf Theatre. With ties to the city, she is still a member of the Chicago-based Theater with a View/Teatro Vista group. While in Illinois, Suárez performed the lead role in several classical plays, and took part in the Illinois Shakespeare Festival. In the late 1990s she starred in Sex, Shame and Tears, the second film of the Nuevo Cine Mexicano, which was \\"her first triumph\\". When asked about her experience making Sex, Shame and Tears, she responded that she remembers it very positively, because it is how she \\"became a part of the story of the cinema of [her] country\\". Around this time, Suárez met future filmmaker Manolo Caro, when he was 14 years old. She went to a recital at his school in Guadalajara; her cousin was Caro's teacher and introduced the pair. Caro then studied architecture, but they became friends when he moved to Mexico City to pursue filmmaking. Suárez is described as Caro's muse, and she has starred in all but one of his works; she did not have a role in Amor de mis amores because Caro \\"did not want to force it\\". After the success of Sex, Shame and Tears, Suárez worked largely in major motion pictures in the early 2000s, including in Hollywood films Spanglish, The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, and The Air I Breathe. This was complemented with work across Mexican film and television. Suárez worked alongside actor Gael García Bernal on multiple occasions in both mediums, as well as with the director Ernesto Contreras, having acclaimed roles in two of his films. She also continued successfully working in theater, having roles alongside Juan Manuel Bernal on the stage as well as in film and television during this period. During the 2000s she was nominated for her first Ariel Award, among other accolades. She began starring in the HBO series Capadocia in 2008, first playing female prisoner La Bambi and then returning to the show as a prison psychologist after Bambi died. As the show dealt with more intense topics and was one of the first shows based around different personalities in a women's prison, Suárez spent time researching and then mentally preparing for both roles. In 2009, she was nominated for an Emmy Award for playing La Bambi, being the first Spanish-speaking actress to receive such a nomination. alt=Photograph of Cecilia Suárez at a red carpet event. In the 2010s, Caro began his career as a successful director and screenwriter. Suárez starred in his works, as well as the works of her sister, among other projects. After her son was born in 2010 she chose to stay in Mexico City for work. Despite many of her films from this period being attached to Caro, Suárez says she does not feel boxed-in as an actress, nor like she is playing it safe, as she works with Caro on projects that she knows he has put a lot of care into and that are challenging. Suárez starred in the film Nos vemos, papá, which focuses on how grief is expressed, exploring this through her character's response to the death of her father. The film was released shortly after Suárez's own father died at the end of 2012. Suárez said that though it was \\"a remarkable coincidence\\" to her family, she believed it was \\"no accident\\", and that her role in the film had happened to help her deal with her own grief. Following her second Ariel nomination in 2015, Suárez took roles in 2016 in the Netflix original series Sense8 and the Netflix-distributed film Macho, as well as the comedy film Cuando los hijos regresan with Carmen Maura. In 2017 she joined Netflix again, signing on to play a role in another original created by Caro, The House of Flowers, also beginning work on the American film Overboard. Gaining international recognition for her role as Paulina de la Mora in The House of Flowers, Suárez remained with the streaming network to star in more works created by Caro and voice a role in the Spanish-language version of Netflix's first animated feature film. Alejandro Mancilla, profiling the actress in 2018, wrote that although Suárez does not like working in telenovelas and only did a few at the start of her career, \\"the essence of Suárez is in her work in movies and series whose content and setting is eminently Mexican\\". She primarily works in the Spanish language and in Mexico on Mexican productions, not being supportive of \\"American culture's version\\" of Mexican narratives and disliking being offered only stereotypical roles. However, she has explained that she has no objection to working in Hollywood when the role is right, having only taken a break from international productions to settle down when her son was born – she also took a four-year break from theater after becoming pregnant. Her first Hollywood film was 2004's Spanglish; she says she took the role because she wanted to work with its director, James L. Brooks. She has said that she enjoys playing diverse roles and performing in different genres. In 2015, Suárez directed a short play, saying she would consider more directing, but only in theater; she says theater is her \\"greatest passion\\" and \\"refuge\\". She also has a program called TNT + Film, where she presents interviews, facts, and news about Mexican cinema. In 2009 she wrote the chapter \\"Una habitación propia\\" (\\"A room of one's own\\") for the book Gritos y susurros II: experiencias intempestivas de otras 39 mujeres.  Activism  Suárez is known to combat injustices in Mexico by using her platform to speak out on issues; Caro has said that she has faced backlash because people in Mexico are not used to such direct speech. She runs a project within Mexican public hospitals, with support from the Department of Health, to promote safe childbirth, and has spoken out against the culture of machismo; she is on the Mexican government's advisory board analyzing the representation of machismo and violence against women in media. She is also vocal about sexism within the Mexican film industry and has supported the Me Too movement. For many years Suárez was a partner and activist with Greenpeace, after beginning a campaign with them for the protection of Mexican maize in 2006. In 2018, Suárez reflected on her work with Greenpeace, saying that the organization taught her about the world of activism. Suárez began working with the United Nations (UN) in 2011 to create a UN Human Rights Initiative in Latin America after the Mexican government began cracking down on organized crime to the point of suppressing human rights activists. The campaign is called \\"Declárate\\", which she remains a spokeswoman of. In 2018, Suárez was named a Spotlight Initiative Champion to the UN campaign against femicide, and she gave a lecture to the UN assembly in New York City titled \\"Enough\\" in September that year. She was one of five representatives to give a speech when opening the UN and European Union's 2019 €50 million Spotlight Initiative campaign to end femicide in Latin America. Personal life alt= In 2001, Suárez was in a relationship with García Bernal, and the two were still being linked after starring in 2002's Fidel together. She then dated actor Osvaldo de León between 2009 and 2010. With de León, Suárez has a son, Teo. He was born in April 2010, and his godfather is Caro. Suárez met de León in 2009, and they began improvising flirtatious lines when starring together in the play Othello before starting a relationship. They split in August 2010, shortly after their son was born. Suárez retained custody of Teo and, in 2015, took out a restraining order against de León on behalf of the child, claiming that he had been both physically and psychologically violent to Teo and was not making child support payments. De León refuted the allegations, though the order was ruled in Suárez's favor. In November 2019, de León spoke about their relationship for the first time since the order, saying that \\"everything is fine\\" between the pair, though his other children have not met Teo. Awards and honors Suárez has twice been nominated for the Ariel Award. She received a nomination for an International Emmy in the Best Performance by an Actress category in 2009, for her role of La Bambi in the TV series Capadocia; she became the first native Spanish speaker and first Mexican to be nominated for this award. In 2013, she won the Best Actress award at the Guadalajara International Film Festival for her role in Tercera llamada. In 2004 and 2005 she was nominated for the Mexican MTV Movie Award, for roles in Sin ton ni sonia and Puños Rosas. In 2018, Suárez became the first woman to receive the Premio Cuervo Tradicional, Mexico's lifetime achievement award in film and television. That same year, she received the Bazaar Actitud 43/Actitud Expresiva award, a lifetime achievement award in Spain that was presented to her by Maura, and the Mexican National Theatre lifetime achievement award. This was presented to her during a performance of A Doll's House, Part 2, where she played the lead. In November 2012, Suárez and García Bernal were named \\"distinguished guests\\" of the city of Morelia, the location of the Morelia International Film Festival, one of Mexico's largest film festivals, for their contributions to cinema. In 2019, Suárez co-hosted the 6th Platino Awards, where she also won for playing Paulina de la Mora in The House of Flowers, in the Best Actress (TV) category. She won this again for the same role in 2020.  Filmography and theater  Suárez has had over 60 film and television roles, and over 30 theatrical ones, with over 20 combined awards and nominations for her performances.

Genetic equilibrium describes a theoretical state that is the basis for determining whether and in what ways populations may deviate from it. Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium is one theoretical framework for studying genetic equilibrium. It is commonly studied using models that take as their assumptions those of Hardy-Weinberg, meaning: *No gene mutations occurring at that locus or the loci associated with the trait *A large population size *Limited-to-no immigration, emigration, or migration (genetic flow) *No natural selection on that locus or trait *Random mating (panmixis) It can describe other types of equilibrium as well, especially in modeling contexts. In particular, many models use a variation of the Hardy–Weinberg principle as their basis. Instead of all of the Hardy–Weinberg characters being present, these instead assume a balance between the diversifying effects of genetic drift and the homogenizing effects of migration between populations. A population not at equilibrium suggests that one of the assumptions of the model in question has been violated. Theoretical models of genetic equilibrium The Hardy–Weinberg principle provides the mathematical framework for genetic equilibrium. Genetic equilibrium itself, whether Hardy-Weinberg or otherwise, provides the groundwork for a number of applications, in including population genetics, conservation and evolutionary biology. With the rapid increase in whole genome sequences available as well as the proliferation of anonymous markers, models have been used to extend the initial theory to all manner of biological contexts. Using data from genetic markers such as ISSRs and RAPDs as well as the predictive potential of statistics, studies have developed models to infer what processes drove the lack of equilibrium. This includes local adaptation, range contraction and expansion and lack of gene flow due to geographic or behavioral barriers, although equilibrium modeling has been applied to a wide range of topics and questions. Equilibrium modeling have led to developments in the field. Because allelic dominance can disrupt predictions of equilibrium,Kramer, Koen; van der Werf, D. C. (2010). \\"Equilibrium and non-equilibrium concepts in forest genetic modeling: population- and individually-based approaches,\\" Forest Systems, 19(SI): 100–112. some models have moved away from using genetic equilibrium as an assumption. Instead of the traditional F-statistics, they make use of Bayesian estimates. Holsinger et al. developed an analog to FST, called theta. Studies have found Bayesian estimates to be better predictors of the patterns observed. However, genetic equilibrium-based modeling remains a tool in population and conservation genetics-it can provide invaluable information about previous historical processes. Biological study systems Genetic equilibrium has been studied in a number of taxa. Some marine species in particular have been used as study systems. The life history of marine organisms like sea urchins appear to fulfill the requirements of genetic equilibrium modeling better than terrestrial species.. They exist in large, panmictic populations that don’t appear to be strongly affected by geographic barriers. In spite of this, some studies have found considerable differentiation across the range of a species. Instead, when looking for genetic equilibrium, studies found large, widespread species complexes.. This indicates that genetic equilibrium may be rare or difficult to identify in the wild, due to considerable local demographic changes on shorter time scales. In fact, although a large population size is a required condition for genetic equilibrium according to Hardy–Weinberg, some have argued that a large population size can actually slow the approach to genetic equilibrium. This can have implications for conservation, where genetic equilibrium can be used as a marker of a healthy and sustainable population.

Has now a count of 5 oneman stand up shows, from 1998 to 2007: 'Det ligger i generne' (It's in the genes)(1998), 'Gearet 2 tænder' (Geared 2 tacks)(2000), 'Op på fars jihad' (Onto dad's jihad)(2002), 'Den grimme melding' (The ugly announcement)(2004) and 'Big Time Paranoia' (2007). Gintberg is especially known for talking about politicians, political subjects and other current events in his shows. Mostly it's the Danish Government that's in his focus. On 1 November 2006 Gintberg published is first ever book, Dysfunktionel Far, about his life as a father, seen from Gintberg's characteristic, and humorous, point of view. Gintberg Verden (Gintberg's World), a book collecting Gintberg's best columns from a variety of newspapers, was published in the fall of 2007. He also gave voice to Mushu in the movie Mulan. Personal life Gintberg is the youngest of four siblings, with two sisters and one brother. Despite a lot of joking about marriage, Gintberg married his longtime girlfriend Nina Sepstrup. They have two children, Eline (b. 1997), and August (b. 2004). Eline suffers from Down syndrome. They currently live in Søborg, in Northern Zealand of Denmark. Although Gintberg is known to be a rather political-centered comedian, he has not revealed his own political views or party.

Of course, \\"divided Poland\\" in the 19th century was the territory of the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and not that one of today's Republic of Poland. After Polish independence was declared on 11 November 1918, the independent Polish state administered its own railways until control was surrendered to German and Soviet occupiers during World War II. During and after World War II major changes were made again, with the Polish borders shifted westward in 1945, putting many German railways under Polish control and leaving several Polish ones in the East.  1835-1914  =Prussian heritage lines= Breslau (Wrocław ), about 1880 Upper Silesian Railway Company In 1842, the Upper Silesian Railway Company, licensed since 1839, opened the first two sections of its main line: Breslau () to Ohlau () on 22 May and Ohlau () to Brieg () in August. These are the oldest railway sections of present Poland. Step by step the Upper Silesian Railway (Oberschlesische Eisenbahn, OSE) line was extended, in 1846 connecting Katowice. In 1847 Mysłowice at the border of Austrian Galicia was reached and the connection to Kraków and Upper Silesian Railway complete. In 1856 the Upper Silesian Railway Company built a line from Breslau (Wrocław) to Posen (), and took over the administration of Stargard–Poznań Railway, in order to control the traffic between Silesia and the Port of Stettin (). Oberschlesische Schmalspurbahn (OSSB) In 1851 inside its standard gauge main line, the Upper Silesian Railway Company started to build a narrow gauge network, connecting local mining trams. This Oberschlesische Schmalspurbahn (OSSB) survived the nationalization of the standard gauge lines, and in two steps 1920 and 1945 became present day Górnośląskie Koleje Wąskotorowe (GKW). By time it was extended to its top length of 233.5 km in 1965. A small rest is still busy, offering a tourist passenger service. Lower Silesian-Mark Railway In 1843, the Lower Silesian-Mark Railway (, NME) opened its first section from Breslau () to Königszelt (). In 1846 the line joining Breslau () to Berlin was completed. William Railway 1846 to 1848 the William Railway (, ) was built in Prussian Upper Silesia to link the Upper Silesian Railway (, ) from Cosel (, now in polish town Kędzierzyn-Koźle) to the Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway (, ) in Austrian Silesia now Czech Silesia. The junction and terminus of both lines at the border was in Oderberg (, ). The junction provided the communication between Berlin and Vienna as well as between Warsaw or Kraków and Vienna. Silesian Mountain Railway The Silesian Mountain Railway from Görlitz via Lauban () and Hirschberg () to Waldenburg () was opened in 1867 and extended to Glatz () in 1880. The station of Poznań in 1863 Stargard-Poznań Railway Poznań was connected with Berlin via Stettin (Szczecin) in 1848 by erecting Stargard-Poznań Railway. Prussian Eastern Railway At the same, the Prussian Eastern Railway was planned from Berlin to Königsberg (present day Kaliningrad), passing through stations like Küstrin (Kostrzyn nad Odrą), Schneidemühl (Piła), Bromberg (Bydgoszcz) with a branch to Danzig (Gdańsk). The station of Kreuz (Krzyż) at the crossing point of Stettin–Poznań and Berlin–Königsberg had primarily been laid out for the latter to line be the trunk. Most parts of this main line were opened in 1852, but the construction of the bridges across Oder river at Küstrin (Kostrzyn) and Vistula and Nogat rivers between Dirschau (Tczew) and Marienburg (Malbork) was not completed before 1857. In 1867, two other lines were opened: from Stettin/Szczecin to Danzig/Gdańsk via Stargard Szczeciński, Belgard (Białogard), Köslin (Koszalin) and Lauenburg in Pommern (Lębork); Frankfurt to Poznań via Reppen (Rzepin) and Bentschen (Zbąszyń). Prussian state railways An economic crisis caused by speculation in railway shares hit stocks in Germany and Austria in 1875. The Chancellor of Germany, Otto von Bismarck, supported the elimination of speculation on railway joint-stock companies. He also supported the state's compulsory purchase of railways from private owners, as well as the introduction of an exclusive goods rate for the transport of agricultural products from Pomerania and East Prussia to Berlin. Prussia nationalized its railways in 1880 in an effort both to lower rates on freight service and to equalize those rates among shippers. However, instead of lowering rates as far as possible, the government ran the railways as a profit-making undertaking, and the railway profits became a major source of state revenue. The nationalization of the railways slowed the economic development of Prussia because the state favoured the relatively backward agricultural areas in its railway building. Moreover, the railway surpluses substituted for the development of an adequate tax system.Rainer Fremdling, \\"Freight Rates and State Budget: The Role of the National Prussian Railways 1880–1913,\\" Journal of European Economic History, Spring 1980, Vol. 9#1 pp 21-40 In 1893, the Prussian state railways introduced the first modern fast trains (in German \\"D-Zug\\") using the new steam locomotive (S2/PKP class Pd1) which could reach a speed of . The trains also included 4-axle bogie coaches with compartments and side corridor and covered gangways (Corridor trains). One such fast train route was that from Berlin to Bromberg and Danzig. In 1898, the first locomotive using superheated steam in the world, designed by Wilhelm Schmidt, was produced by the Vulkan company in Stettin for Prussian state railways (KPEV Hannover 74 S4). This opened a new age of steam locomotive development. Construction of the prototypes of superheated steam locomotive classes by Robert Garbe started in 1902. These were: S4 (PKP class Pd2) for fast trains, P6 (PKP class Oi1) per passenger trains and G8 (PKP class Tp3) for goods trains. In the same year the Malborsko-Mławska Railway (the last large private railway under Prussian rule) was nationalized. 1906 saw the continued production of famous standard superheated steam locomotive classes by Garbe in the Linke-Hofmann locomotive factory in Breslau for the Prussian state railways. 584 of S6/PKP class Pd5 were produced, of which 82 units were operated by Polish State Railways (PKP). Approximately 4000 of P8/PKP class Ok1 were produced, of which 257 were operated by PKP before World War II, and 429 after the war. One of these, Ok1-359, is currently preserved in working order at the Wolsztyn museum. Öls-Adelnau-Ostrów line In 1910, the Öls-Adelnau-Ostrów line / Oleśnica-Odolanów-Ostrów Wielkopolski line that shortened the connection between Wrocław-Łódź and Warsaw was opened. Construction of the prototype of the long series 5-axle Prussian cargo locomotive G10 (PKP class Tw1) with exchange chamber with steam locomotive P8 (PKP class Ok1) by Garbe took place the same year. Three years later, production of cargo locomotive G8.1 of the Prussian state railways (PKP class Tp4) in the F. Schichau factory in Elbing commenced. Final production figures were 5267 items (459 items by PKP). That was the second longest locomotive series in Europe.The longest series of more than 7,000 items was DRB Class 52, a so called War Locomotive of World War II = Warsaw–Vienna line = Vienna Station in Warsaw, about 1850 Borsig engine from the 1860es of Warsaw–Vienna line In 1839, the Warsaw-Vienna Railway Company was founded as a joint stock company. In the same year it applied for a license to build the Warsaw-Vienna Railway line. Construction started in 1840, but in 1842 the company went bankrupt. The shares and property were taken over by the Government of Russian Poland in 1843 and construction continued. The first section (from Warsaw to Grodzisk Mazowiecki) was finished on 15 June 1845, and before December had reached Skierniewice. The whole line to Granica (\\"Border\\") station was completed in 1848, with a junction to Szkarpawa station of Kraków and Upper Silesia Railway. In the same year, after the outbreak of the Spring of Nations, the first large international railway-military operation dispatched over 200,000 mounted Russian soldiers from Warsaw to Vienna and Budapest to help the Emperor of Austria put down the uprising. In 1859, the Government of Russia turned over the Warsaw-Vienna Railway to private owners. Opened in 1865/66, the new double track branch of Warsaw–Vienna Railway from Koluszki to Łódź Fabryczna was the most profitable railway in Congress Poland. In 1894, the Warsaw-Vienna Railway ordered 13 fast steam locomotives with the Prussian S 2 design, and a series of modern 4-axle cars which covered transit routes from Schwartzkopff. It was decided to nationalize the Warsaw and Vienna and Warsaw and Bydgoszcz Railways and the broad gauge track Kaliska Railway managed by this society. One year later, a decision was made to readjust the Warsaw and Vienna Railway to broad gauge track, but it was not realized. In 1902, the Warsaw–Vienna Company built a wide gauge railway from Warsaw to Kalisz via Łowicz and Łódź (the Warsaw–Kalisz Railway), on a route different from the company's standard gauge line. At that time, Kalisz lay near the western border of Russian Empire. In 1906, it was joined to Nowe Skalmierzyce on the Prussian side of the border, providing a direct communication between Łódź and Lower Silesia. =Austrian heritage lines= ÖStB in Galicia Kraków and Upper Silesian Railway Kraków Main Station (Kraków Główny) In 1847, the Kraków and Upper Silesian Railway (Kolej Krakowsko-Górnośląska), connecting Kraków to Mysłowice in Prussian Upper Silesia was completed. Owned by the City of Kraków, it was the first railway in the Austrian ruled part of Poland. It was linked to the Upper Silesian railway (Wrocław/Breslau to Upper Silesia) in the same year and to the Warsaw–Vienna Railway in 1848. Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway Though in 1836 a licence had been issued to the Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway to connect Vienna, Ostrava, Kraków and Bochnia, that railway was only built from Vienna to Bohumín on the Austrian and Prussian border, and the only rail communication form Vienna to Kraków used Prussian rails in upper Silesia until 1856. Karol Ludvig Galician Railway After some reorganizations, the Karol Ludvig Galician Railway (after intermediate Eastern National Railway ÖStB descendant of the Kraków and Upper Silesian Railway), step by step extended eastward, connected Kraków to Lwów (Lemberg, Lviv) in 1861. = Russian heritage lines = Broad gauge locomotive St. Petersburg Station in Warsaw, 1862–1915 The standard gauge Warsaw and Vienna Line had been the first long distance railway under Russian rule at all. Saint Petersburg–Warsaw Railway Warsaw's first link to the system was the Saint Petersburg–Warsaw Railway, completed in 1862. One year before, a branch of the line had reached the Russian and Prussian border with Verzhbolovo Station in Kybartai. This first junction of Russian wide gauge and Prussian standard gauge networks passed the northeastern corner of Russian Poland, which did not become part of Poland again after Polish revival. Warsaw and Bydgoszcz Railway Also in 1862, the last standard gauge main railway line in Russian Poland was opened between Łowicz (at a branch of the Warsaw and Vienna Line) to Aleksandrów Kujawski near the Prussian border. It was the Russian part of the Warsaw and Bydgoszcz Railway, the first direct connection between Warsaw and the Prussian ruled parts of old Poland. Warsaw-Terespol Railway In 1866, the direct railway form Moscow to Warsaw via Brest was finished. Iwanogrodzko-Dąbrowska Railway Later, another wide gauge railway track was added: the Iwanogrodzko-Dąbrowska Railway from Dęblin via Radom-Bzin (now Skarżysko-Kamienna)-Kielce-Tunnel to Dąbrowa (now Dąbrowa Górnicza Strzemieszyce) and from Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski to Łódź via Bzin-Tomaszów Mazowiecki-Koluszki. This caused a temporary decrease of cargo transport (mainly coal) on the Warszawa-Vienna Railway. The Russian General Staff confirmed the exclusive production of wide gauge equipment in the territory of Russia. Wrocław-Warsaw Railway The Russian authorities refused extension of the Wrocław-Warsaw Railway (Oleśnica-Podzamcze) to Łódź and Warsaw on their territory. Warszawa Praga railway station built around 1877 (no longer existing) The Engineering Railway School in Warsaw was opened under the line's protection in 1873. Ring Railway (Kolej Obwodowa) In 1875, Warsaw's first railway bridge across Vistula river was opened (Gdański Bridge – former Ring Railway Bridge), connecting the wide gauge lines east of the river to the standard gauge lines starting from Vienna Station in the west. Ring Railway (Kolej Obwodowa), in 1876, connected the Warsaw-Vienna and Warsaw-Terespol Railways Other In 1888, all railroads in Russia were nationalized. The revolution of 1905 in Russia and Congress Poland led to the disorder of the rail traffic on many important routes and many important junctions. However, after the revolutionary events, the traffic was restored and many new technical improvements were implemented, especially for military sake.  World War I  Russian infantry marching along railway lines Soon after occupying Polish areas, the German railway army readjusted the railway from Russian (broad gauge) to . On the Russian side, most of the rolling stock of the Warsaw-Vienna Rail, Warsaw-Bydgoszcz and Kaliska Rail (as well as the headquarters of these lines) was relocated by the retreating Russian army. In its retreat the Tsar's army also destroyed the central locomotive hall of Russian-Polish standard gauge railways in Łowicz and Saint Petersburg Station in Warsaw. In response to a counter-attack by the Russian army, German General Ludendorff ordered the destruction of strategic parts of the Warsaw-Vienna line and the Kalisz Railway between Warsaw, Łódź, Kutno and Kalisz. In 1915, the German and Austrian armies completed adapting a significant portion of all broad gauge track to standard gauge. As the railway bridge over the Vistula River had been damaged, the Germans used ferries to move locomotives across the river in Warsaw. The same year saw construction of military railways on the Wielbork-Ostrołęka and Rozwadów-Sandomierz routes, as well as additional lines on the Kalisz Railway. Modern German railway rolling stock replaced the broad gauge stock which had been removed to Russia.  1918-1939  :For the state of Polish railways in 1939 see Polish National Railroads Summer 1939 On 3 January 1918, the Regency Council transferred the management of the state railway in the former Congress Poland to the Ministry of Business and Industry. In fact, the management belonged to Militäreisenbahn- Generaldirektion Warschau (MGD). In October of the same year, the Regency Council brought into being the Ministry of Communication. On 31 October 1918, Polish railwaymen took over the Railway Directorate in Kraków and railways in Galicia and Śląsk Cieszyński, beginning the takeover of railways in the former Russian and Austrian sectors. Polish railwaymen took over the management of railways in the Warsaw district on the same day. = Independent Poland railways = Polish locomotive Pm36-1 (140 km/h) dated 1937. PKP Pt31 series (1932–1940) One share of Polish First Locomotive Factory in Chrzanów Gaining independence on 11 November 1918 allowed Poland to reclaim the former Russian and Austrian sectors from military railways. The Railway Department in the Ministry of Communication was created and the Polish railways were officially named Polskie Koleje Państwowe. In December 1918, the Great Poland Uprising started. The rebels took over the former Prussian sector of railways. One year later, the fights for Lwów were over and the former Austrian railway directorate was taken over by Poland and their left-hand traffic infrastructure was reconstructed. Taking over the railways from Prussians lasted until 1921. In 1919, Stanislaw Rodowicz, Eng. developed the first draft of the container system in Poland. In 1920 he built the prototype of the biaxial wagon. The Polish-Bolshevik War halted the development of the container system in Poland. After the victory over the Red Army in the Polish- Bolshevik War (1920), a great deal of damage in railway structure was discovered on the route along which the communists were retreating. At the same time, the tense relations with Lithuania led the railways around Wilno and Minsk to a partial disintegration and stagnation. The Libau–Romny Railway was not recovered. Polish railways administration finally took over the railways in Upper Silesia in 1922. That same year, a decision was made to divide railways in Poland into nine administrative districts. An economic crisis in 1930s forced the state to cut back its budget for railway investment. Profit decreased by 50% compared to 1929. The next year, over 23,000 PKP employees had been dismissed and protests and strikes causes authorities to try to find a solution. The end of the crisis and an increase of cargo transport and income came in 1937. = Motive Power = The government of Paderewski purchased 150 steam locomotives type Consolidation from the United States in 1919. The same year French authorities offered one hundred captured German steam locomotives and two thousand cargo vehicles. Twenty-five items of PKP class Tr20 locomotives were ordered from the USA in 1920. The Poles fought to get compensation for railway rolling stock from the defeated Central Powers, mainly Germany, in accordance with Article 371 of the Versailles Treaty, and the Treaties of Saint Germain (from Austria) and the Trianon (from Hungary) took almost three years (1921-1923). They received around 2,900 steam locomotives from the former German railways and over 1,300 from the Austrian railways. In 1921, the first orders for steam locomotives for PKP from German factories (PKP class Ok1, PKP class Tp4 and PKP class Tw1) and Austrian (PKP class Tr12, PKP class Okm11). A reconstruction of Austrian steam locomotives PKP class Tr12 from spare parts in Warsaw Steam Locomotive Company Ltd. started as well. In 1923, construction of the First Locomotive Factory in Chrzanów, Poland started. The same year, local production began in the Warszawa Steam Locomotive Joint Stock Company. The first Polish steam locomotives in Germany and Belgium (PKP class Tr21, PKP class Ok22, PKP class Ty23) were ordered. A year after, steam locomotive production in H. Cegielski factory in Poznań began. The State's financial problems stopped orders for rolling stock abroad. After 1933, PKP had to deal with competition by \\"wild\\" carters and raftsmen, offering horse and river transport for distances over at lower prices than the railway. From 1936, the Factory in Chrzanów worked at its own cost (without PKP orders) on fast steam locomotive PKP class Pm36 in two versions. Engineer K. Zembrzuski was the contractor of this locomotive. In 1937, the prototype Pm36-1 with aerodynamic lagging won the gold medal on the world exhibition in Paris. The speed test of Pm36 on the back way from Paris reached over on German rails. = New railway lines = Opening of Warszawa–Radom connection In 1920, a decision was made to construct of new railway line urgently: Łódź-Kutno-Płock-Sierpc-Nasielsk, Kutno-Strzałkowo, and gaps in lines, bypassing the connections broken by the new border with Germany and Gdańsk. A year later, construction began on the Kutno-Konin-Strzałkowo railway, to shorten connections between Warsaw and Poznań. In 1922, construction of the Kutno-Płock and Swarzewo-Hel lines started. In 1924, the Nasielsk-Sierpc line and construction of a new port station and railway junction in Gdynia opened. A Customs War with Germany started in 1925, causing a rush to build a port in Gdynia and a detour line from Silesia to the coast by-passing German territory. In 1927, the first Polish electric railway was built: the private EKD Warszawa-Podkowa Leśna-Grodzisk/Milanówek with branches to Włochy near Warszawa. The French-Polish Rail Association finished construction of the Polish Coal Trunk Line between Bydgoszcz and Gdynia in 1933. In 1934, the beginning of the use of a new railway line, Warszawa-Radom, opening the new connection from Warszawa to Kraków, and preparation to electrification works on Warszawa railway junction and suburbs took place. In 1936 the first electric line based on 3,000 V DC from Warszawa to Otwock and Pruszków opened.  World War II  German panzer train On 1 September 1939, railwaymen of Szymankowo stopped a German armoured train before its arrival on the bridge over the Vistula River and blew up the bridge. After the Soviet invasion of eastern Poland on 17 September 1939, most Polish rolling stock fell into Soviet hands. The Polish railways in Silesia, Wielkopolska and Pomorze were adopted by German railways Deutsche Reichsbahn on 25 September. Until the last moment before the German attack on the Soviet Union in 1941, cargo trains transported goods from the Soviet Union to Germany. The beginning of German attacks on the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 resulted in the possession of railway and rolling stock by Ostbahn and the possession of PKP rolling stock with broad gauge track and reconstruction to standard gauge. The beginning of organized sabotage by the Polish resistance movement on railways took place about the same time. In 1942, global production of simple military steam locomotives, DR Kriegslok BR52 (PKP class Ty2), in Poznań and Chrzanów, and of steam boilers for these locomotives started in Sosnowiec. In 1944, production of the first steam locomotive BR52 in Chrzanów started. The Warsaw Uprising caused widespread damage of Warsaw rolling stock, network and electric traction; both bridges over the Vistula River and the tunnel on the Warsaw Cross-City Line were destroyed. The unfinished Warszawa Główna railway station was partially destroyed several times 1939-1941 and finally blown up by the Germans.  Communist period  Warszawa Centralna railway station in Poland (1975). At the beginning of 1945, the Ministry of Transport was created, as well as the Regional Directorate of National Railways. Many pre- war locomotives were sent to the Soviet Union. Poland received many German locomotives as a compensation for war losses. In June, the rail connection with Warsaw was opened, using a temporary railway station made of warehouses. On 15 September 1945, PKP took over management of all railway lines on new Polish territory from the Soviet Union. Most of these lines were either destroyed or inaccessible. The railways in the country were divided into 10 districts. In 1946, the Fablok and Cegielski factories started the production of PKP class Pt47 (pre-war PKP class Pt31) and PKP class Ty45 (pre-war PKP class Ty37) locomotives. Meanwhile, the production of PKP class Ty42 (German BR52) was in process and Poznań prepared to start the production of PKP class Ty43 (German BR42) which had been produced in Szczecin previously. The situation in the Polish railways was disastrous, so the government decided to buy 75 USATC S160 (Polish PKP class Tr201) American locomotives (on UNRRA basis), 30 British 9F (Polish PKP class Tr202) locomotives, and 500 S160 Polish PKP class Tr203) locomotives, what was left from American army in Europe. Another 100 locomotives ordered from USA (Decapol – Polish PKP class Ty246) were sent to service Śląsk-Gdynia line. In the same year, electric trains started an operating line from Warszawa to Otwock. Polish railways regained pre-war locomotives from Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia (in 1947), yet units from the eastern parts of Poland were taken over by USSR and rebuilt to operate on a wide gauge. Two years after the war's end, the first passenger cars are built in Cegielski (Poznań) and PaFaWag (Wrocław), while freight cars were being built in Chrzanów and Zielona Góra. At the same time, Warsaw railway lines were rebuilt together with the tunnel under the country's capital. As a part of the Ministry of Communication, the Bureau for Railway Electrification was founded. The first projects were to rebuild all lines that had been electrified before the war, and then the Warsaw-Żyrardów- Skierniewice-Koluszki and the Warszawa-Sochaczew lines would be electrified. The electrification was planned to bring 3000V AC into Polish railways. The modernised version of PKP class Pt31 locomotive started in 1948, the locomotive gaining a new name, Pt47. Reconstruction of German S-Bahn EMUs started the same year, which required building overhead lines in the Tricity area. Those EMUs were renamed EW90, 91 and 92 and soon after (in 1951) started operating on SKM lines. In 1949 the construction of Tomaszów Mazowiecki–Radom line was completed. The 50s in Polish railways were a time of serious development and improvements. In 1950, construction of TKt48 locomotives started and two years later a prototype of the Ol49 steam locomotive was built. 1953 brought several new types of electric rolling stock into PKP. Ten units of EP03 electric locomotives and 40 units of EW54 EMUs were ordered from Sweden. EW54 EMUs were sent to operate on lines connecting Warsaw with Mińsk Mazowiecki, Żyrardów and Sochaczew. Meanwhile, EP04 and EU20 locomotives were ordered from the DDR, along with EN56 and ED70 EMUs. Polish production in that period included PKP class EW53 EMU and PKP class EP02 locomotive. In 1954 the prototype of the last heavy freight steam engine - PKP class Ty51 - was built. New lines opened that year are Skierniewice-Łuków line and Sitkówka-Busko Zdrój line. Przemyśl-Zagórz trains travelled through the Soviet Union without stops. High speed Central Rail Line (designed in 1977 for speed equal 250 km/h) and Broad Gauge Metallurgy Line (1979) were constructed. The highest speed reached by railway in Poland during the communist period was 160 km/h in 1987 as a regularly scheduled operation from Warsaw to Kraków. It was premiere of the newest Polish electric locomotive EP09. Present-day Poland On 14 December 2014 PKP Intercity Pendolino trains under the name 'Express Intercity Premium' began operating on the CMK line (224 km line from Kraków and Katowice to Warsaw) with trains reaching 200 km/h (124 mph) as a regularly scheduled operation. There is a plan by PKP PLK to increase speed to 230 km/h (142 mph) on whole line soon.PKP PLK website 08.08.2013 The \\"Y\\" High-speed rail in Poland construction has been cancelled. The old building of the Łódź Fabryczna railway station has been removed and an underground station is being constructed. New railway is being constructed in Tricity. Rail history of Warsaw The first railway opened in Warsaw in 1845 (the Warsaw-Vienna Railway). In the next years, the following railways were opened: * Warsaw- Saint Petersburg, in 1862, through Białystok and Vilnius – broad gauge railway, * Warsaw-Moscow, in 1867 – through Terespol, thus called “Warsaw- Terespol Railway” – broad gauge, * Ring Railway (Kolej Obwodowa), in 1876, connected the Warsaw-Vienna and Warsaw-Terespol Railways, * Vistula Riverside Railway (Kolej Nadwiślańska), in 1877 - Mława-Warsaw-Lublin-Kovel – broad gauge, * Warsaw-Kalisz, in 1902 – Warsaw-Sochaczew-Łódź-Kalisz - broad gauge railway. Vienna railway station, ca. 1850 On these railways the following stations were built: Vienna St. (Dworzec Warszawsko-Wiedeński, 1845), Saint Petersburg St. (Dworzec Petersburski, 1863), Terespol St. (Dworzec Terespolski), Vistula St. (Dworzec Nadwiślański, 1878), Kalisz St. (Dworzec Kaliski, 1902). The Vienna St. and Terespolski St. survived World War I, the other stations were pulled down by Russians in 1915, but only the Kaliski St. was not rebuilt after the war. During the war and after it, the broad gauge railways were converted to standard gauge. But right up until 1933, the only line connecting both Vistula banks was the Ring Railway, with the bridge near today’s Gdański Bridge. In 1933, the connection between the Main Station (former Vienna St.) and the Terespol St. was built: as it ran through the densely built-up city center, it was built in a tunnel. This tunnel along with a bridge is called Średnicowy (Cross-City Tunnel) and has approximately . Year 1934 saw the opening of the railway to Radom and further to Kraków.

Hohmann to serve as the 41st Chief of the L.A.P.D., to June 28, 1949, when he resigned under pressure during a grand jury investigation of police corruption. Clemence Brooks Horrall was born in Washington, Indiana and graduated from Washington State University. Horrall had become chief when Hohmann, under pressure from Los Angeles Mayor Fletcher Bowron, voluntarily took a demotion to deputy chief after he had become ensnared in a police corruption trial that had embarrassed the mayor. During his tenure as chief many significant events occurred that would shape Los Angeles during the decade of the 1940s, when the population of the city proper surged from 1.5 million to nearly 2 million people. Events such as World War II, Japanese- American relocation and internment (see Japanese American internment), the Zoot Suit Riots of 1943 and the Black Dahlia homicide roiled the city, as did the Brenda Allen vice scandal of 1948–49 that led to Chief Horrall's resignation after it was found that officers involved with the Hollywood madam perjured themselves under oath during grand jury testimony, as did Horrall himself. He resigned in 1949, succeeded by Marine Major General William A. Worton. Clemence Horrall died in 1960 from a heart attack and was buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Park, by Hollywood Hills. In popular culture * When Jack Webb's radio program Dragnet commenced in 1949, Horrall's endorsement of the program was acknowledged at the end of every episode. That tradition continued with W. A.

It is a form of anisogamy (heterogamy) in which the female gamete (e.g. egg cell) is significantly larger than the male gamete and is non-motile. The male gametes are typically highly motile and are usually tasked with all of the travel necessary to bring the respective gametes together. The prevalence of oogamy in higher animals leads to the conclusion that this specialization of the gametes results in their performing their respective tasks better and more efficiently than those tasks could be performed by generalist isogametes, particularly the ability to concentrate high-energy substances in a smaller number of ova.  Evolutionary oogamy  Oogamy is seen to be the evolutionary step that led to internal fertilization, in response to selective pressures at work to inspire this adaptation. This has been most attributed to the independence of animals from liquid water as a means of fertilization among terrestrial species, however other differentiations at the microscale could have also contributed to the change between oogamy and internal fertilization. One explanation has been the cytoplasmic differences between two gametes, however Randerson & Hurst debunked this theory as unsupported (2001).Randerson, J P. and L D. Hurst. \\"The uncertain evolution of the sexes.\\" Trends Ecol. Evol. 16. n.p.: n.p., n.d.. 28 Mar. 2018. Most alternative explanations that followed focused on selection based on size, behavioral interactions between gamete cells, and the allocation of resources ecologically. For the selection of gamete size necessary to catalyze the transition from isogamy to oogamy, the fitness of an organism would have to increase as egg size increases, and increase as sperm size decreases. The number of gametes within the organism alone would exist as a type of selective pressure that promotes smaller sperm size, but disproportionately selects for less eggs as they grow larger within the organism. This supported Bell's theory (1997) that the selective pressure had to select for growth of egg size more than shrinkage of sperm. The standard assumption remains that the zygote fitness is exponentially increased with zygote volume, with zygote numbers declining. Most recently, Dusenbery (2000) proposed a physical model under the assumption that eggs produce a sperm attractant via pheromones. This provided a mechanism of selection that dramatically increased target size, allowing for a powerful selective force that would produce larger eggs. Assuming the resources available to produce pheromone were proportional to egg volume, the target area was determined as the radius of diffusion of the pheromone's active space, proportional to the rate of pheromone production, and this radius squared would be the target size. The results determined by Dusenbery suggested that this selection process would still occur if the assumption was lessened to only include pheromone production as proportional to egg surface area. Oogamy predominantly occurs in animals, but can also be found in many protists, certain orders of algae (Ochrophytes, Charophyceans), and some plants such as bryophytes, ferns, and some gymnosperms like cycads and ginkgo. In some algae, most gymnosperms and all angiosperms, a variation of oogamy occurs where the sperm cells are non-motile as well. It appears that isogamy was the first stage of sexual reproduction. In several lineages, this form of reproduction independently evolved to anisogamy with gametes of male and female types to oogamy. There is a good argument that this pattern was driven by the physical constraints on the mechanisms by which two gametes get together as required for sexual reproduction.Dusenbery, David B. (2009). Living at Micro Scale, Chapter 20. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts .  Oogamy in Diatoms  Since the discussion of the transition of oogamy generally involves the size proportions of certain sex cells, the ability to reproduce this way is closely associated to cell size of the organism themselves. The process of reproduction is the most prevalent method of restoring cell size and is often triggered when the size of the cell is less than critical level; however, this process differs between centric and pennate diatoms. Centric diatoms are oogamous. The male gametangial cell undergoes a series of four divisions to form a limited number of microspores, which are defined as sperm mother cells. These microspores undergo meiosis to form a flagellated sperm. The oogonial female cells can produce one to two eggs; this female protoplast can facilitate fertilization of the sperm via several different mechanisms, depending on the species. Fertilization results in a zygote, as characteristic in oogamy, which will enlarge into an auxospore after taking up water. It will be spherical in shape with a different valve morphology.

The Gulf of Carpentaria in northern Australia is named after him. Pieter de Carpentier was born in Antwerp in 1586, shortly after the formation of the newly independent Dutch Republic (Republic of the Seven United Netherlands, or United Provinces). He studied philosophy in Leiden, from 1603. In 1616 he sailed on board the sailing vessel De Getrouwheid to Indonesia. There he had a number of functions, including Director-General of the Trade, Member to the Council of the Indies, and member of the Council of Defence. From 1 February 1623 to 30 September 1627 he was the fifth Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies. He participated in the conquest of Jakarta and helped to build the town of Batavia. He did much for the town, including setting up a school, a Town Hall, and the first Orphanage Home. He also designed the structure of the churches in the town. On 12 November 1627 Pieter de Carpentier sailed from the East Indies as Head of the Fleet. He arrived in Holland on 3 June 1628, with five richly-laden merchant ships, and this, combined with the fact that the Government had recently succeeded in releasing three ships from an embargo laid upon them by the English a year previously, led the authorities to determine to send another fleet of eleven ships to the East, with which General Jacob Specks was to sail. Two ships and a yacht being soon ready to sail, the senate sent them to Texel so as to lose no time. These vessels were the Batavia (under Francisco Pelsaert) the Dordrecht (under Isaac van Swaenswyck) and the Assendelft (under Cornelis Vlack). They left Texel for their destination on 28 October 1628. De Carpentier was made Member of the Board of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in October 1629. His maternal uncle, Louis Delbeecque, had been one of the initiators of the VOC. Pieter de Carpentier married Maria Ravevelt in Middelburg on 2 March 1630. She died in September 1641 and was buried on in the Westerkerk in Amsterdam. De Carpentier died in Amsterdam on 5 September 1659, and was also buried in the Westerkerk. They had seven children. When Jan Carstenszoon (or Carstensz) and Willem van Coolsteerdt landed the Pera and the Arnhem on the west coast of Cape York Peninsula of New Holland (now Australia) in 1623, after the first discovery by Willem Janszoon in the Duyfken in 1606, they then named the 'Gulf of Carpentaria' after the Governor-General, Pieter de Carpentier.

They fought as part of the British 29th Division. Of the 2,280 men, most of whom came from Guernsey, who fought on the Western Front with the RGLI, 327 were killed and 667 were wounded. Many Guernsey men had already volunteered for regiments in the British Army before the RGLI was formed. The RGLI was created because there was no Guernsey-named regiment to underline the island's devotion to the Crown. The regimental motto, Diex Aïx, derives from the battle cry used by the Duke of Normandy 1,000 years earlier. The regiment was disbanded in 1919 but the regimental tradition lives on in the Guernsey Army Cadet Force (Det.) Light Infantry, who, although they do not wear the RGLI cap badge, still keep alive the history of the Regiment within the detachment.

He also published Children of Ham (1976).  Early life  The autobiographical Manchild in the Promised Land describes the cultural, economic, and religious conditions that suffused Harlem during Brown's early childhood and adolescence while constructing a narrative of Brown's tumultuous early life. The book explains that in the early 20th century, New York was thought to be the promised land for African Americans, but life in Harlem was more challenging than migrants expected. Brown’s parents, who had been sharecroppers, moved from South Carolina to Harlem in 1935 before they had children and lived in a tenement at 146th Street and Eighth Avenue. Brown had one younger brother and two sisters.Brown, Claude. Manchild in the Promised Land. Macmillan & Co., 1965. Print. From the age of six, his life involved stealing, alcohol consumption, truancy, and gang wars. These harsh realities of life in 1950s Harlem shaped his childhood. Hoping that a year away from Harlem would benefit him, his parents sent him to live with his grandparents in South Carolina. However, this just made Brown crave the violence of the streets.Washington Jr., William m. CliffsNotes on Brown's Manchild in the Promised Land. N.p.: Cliffs Notes, 1971. Print. At the age of 11, he was placed in the Wiltwyck School for Boys, a reform school, which he cycled in and out of more than three times. By that time he had made the acquaintance of Dr. Ernest Papanek, a psychologist and the director of the Wiltwyck School for Boys for deprived and emotionally disturbed boys, in Esopus, Ulster County, New York. Dr. Papanek, whom Mr. Brown described in his book as \\"probably the smartest and the deepest cat I had ever met,\\" encouraged him to seek an education. Although Dr. Papanek pushed him towards getting a better education, Brown still had criminal contacts at Wiltwyck and continued to be involved in street life. Brown had many brushes with the law and had to go to various juvenile detention institutions several times. During one robbery, Brown was shot in the stomach and almost died. In Brown’s mid-teens, he made a living by dealing drugs and becoming a con man. In 1953, he worked in the garment district, but he quit the job after a short time. His younger brother, who he had always thought of as being innocent, had become addicted to drugs. In Manchild in the Promised Land, Brown blames his brother’s unhealthy lifestyle on not having been exposed to the horrors of Harlem early enough in life. Acknowledging the damaging effects of drugs such as heroin and gang violence on his community and his friends, Brown decided to leave. He moved away from Harlem, heartbroken at seeing all his friends \\"strung-out\\" by drug addiction. After being one of the \\"hippest cats\\" (as he says in the book), he moved down to Greenwich Village, where he could start over. For the first time in his life, he decided to get an education and began attending night classes at a high school downtown, supporting himself by working as a busboy and deliveryman and at other odd jobs. He began to take piano lessons and sold cosmetics as he was trying to make up his mind about college. Many of his old friends were in prison or had moved on from Harlem, so he felt like he no longer had a place in Harlem. A friend had told Brown about Reverend William M. James, who was interested in helping young men from the ghetto get into college. Reverend James later tried to help Brown’s brother, but his brother was later arrested and sent to prison for armed robbery. Brown graduated in 1965 from Howard University (where his professors included sociologists E. Franklin Frazier and Nathan Hare), and later went on to attend Stanford and Rutgers law schools, but left when the lecture circuit proved more lucrative than law.David L. Dudley, Oxford Companion to African American Literature.  Career  Brown spent most of his professional life as a full-time lecturer, but also became increasingly active in urban issues, especially with respect to at-risk black adolescents. This lifetime concern led him to pursue criminal justice and rehabilitation issues. He visited juvenile detention centers and prisons to determine what was motivating the youth gangs and individual youths engaging in crime in America's inner cities, a problem that seemingly worsened with the passage of time. Manchild in the Promised Land demonstrated how someone could overcome great odds to become successful. His conclusion was that American society had abandoned these young individuals, causing a profound sense of alienation and ostracism, which led to futile outbursts of excessive, wanton violence and criminality. Brown remained critical of what he perceived as society's failure to address these existential crises afflicting African- American youth, particularly those residing in urban areas, and more broadly, underserved, alienated American youth in general. Manchild in the Promised Land has sold over 4 million copies and has been translated to 14 different languages. As of 2002 it was on the curriculum in many high schools and colleges.Worth, Robert F., \\"Claude Brown, Manchild of the Promised Land, Dies at 64\\", The New York Times. February 6, 2002. Web. March 2, 2013. However, the book was banned in certain schools for its use of frank language. In 1971, a complaint in the Chicago Daily Defender, asserted that the book is \\"pornographic literature,\\" and had \\"428 incidents of impure words.\\"\\"Black History Book Rapped\\" Chicago Daily Defender (1960-1973); May 25, 1971; ProQuest Historical Newspapers: Chicago Defender (1910-1975), p. 5. The book was banned in 1974 at a high school in Massachusetts because the headmaster found the language \\"filthy.\\"The English Journal, Vol. 63, No. 5 (May 1974), pp. 61–65. Brown published a second book, Children Of Ham, which explores the lives of several black teenagers from Harlem who escape the clutches of heroin. In comparison to sales of his first work, it was a failure. He also wrote several articles for national magazines, including Esquire and Look. In 1961, Brown’s article \\"Harlem, My Harlem\\" was published in Dissent. Claude Brown died of respiratory failure in 2002.

It is a Hamiltonian formulation of Einstein's general theory of relativity. The basic theory was outlined by Bryce DeWitt in a seminal 1967 paper, and based on earlier work by Peter G. Bergmann using the so-called canonical quantization techniques for constrained Hamiltonian systems invented by Paul Dirac. Dirac's approach allows the quantization of systems that include gauge symmetries using Hamiltonian techniques in a fixed gauge choice. Newer approaches based in part on the work of DeWitt and Dirac include the Hartle–Hawking state, Regge calculus, the Wheeler–DeWitt equation and loop quantum gravity.  Canonical quantization  In the Hamiltonian formulation of ordinary classical mechanics the Poisson bracket is an important concept. A \\"canonical coordinate system\\" consists of canonical position and momentum variables that satisfy canonical Poisson-bracket relations, \\\\\\\\{ q_i , p_j \\\\\\\\} = \\\\delta_{ij} where the Poisson bracket is given by :\\\\\\\\{f,g\\\\\\\\} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial q_i} \\\\frac{\\\\partial g}{\\\\partial p_i} - \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial p_i} \\\\frac{\\\\partial g}{\\\\partial q_i}\\\\right). for arbitrary phase space functions f (q_i , p_j) and g (q_i , p_j). With the use of Poisson brackets, the Hamilton's equations can be rewritten as, : \\\\dot{q}_i = \\\\\\\\{ q_i , H \\\\\\\\}, : \\\\dot{p}_i = \\\\\\\\{ p_i , H \\\\\\\\}. These equations describe a \`\`flow\\" or orbit in phase space generated by the Hamiltonian H. Given any phase space function F (q,p), we have : {d \\\\over dt} F (q_i,p_i) = \\\\\\\\{ F , H \\\\\\\\}. In canonical quantization the phase space variables are promoted to quantum operators on a Hilbert space and the Poisson bracket between phase space variables is replaced by the canonical commutation relation: : [\\\\hat{q} , \\\\hat{p}] = i \\\\hbar. In the so-called position representation this commutation relation is realized by the choice: : \\\\hat{q} \\\\psi (q) = q \\\\psi (q) and \\\\hat{p} \\\\psi (q) = -i \\\\hbar {d \\\\over d q} \\\\psi (q) The dynamics are described by Schrödinger equation: : i \\\\hbar {\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial t} \\\\psi = \\\\hat{H} \\\\psi where \\\\hat{H} is the operator formed from the Hamiltonian H (q,p) with the replacement q \\\\mapsto q and p \\\\mapsto -i \\\\hbar {d \\\\over d q}.  Canonical quantization with constraints  Canonical classical general relativity is an example of a fully constrained theory. In constrained theories there are different kinds of phase space: the unrestricted (also called kinematic) phase space on which constraint functions are defined and the reduced phase space on which the constraints have already been solved. For canonical quantization in general terms, phase space is replaced by an appropriate Hilbert space and phase space variables are to be promoted to quantum operators. In Dirac's approach to quantization the unrestricted phase space is replaced by the so- called kinematic Hilbert space and the constraint functions replaced by constraint operators implemented on the kinematic Hilbert space; solutions are then searched for. These quantum constraint equations are the central equations of canonical quantum general relativity, at least in the Dirac approach which is the approach usually taken. In theories with constraints there is also the reduced phase space quantization where the constraints are solved at the classical level and the phase space variables of the reduced phase space are then promoted to quantum operators, however this approache was thought to be impossible in General relativity as it seemed to be equivalent to finding a general solution to the classical field equations. However, with the fairly recent development of a systematic approximation scheme for calculating observables of General relativity (for the first time) by Bianca Dittrich, based on ideas introduced by Carlo Rovelli, a viable scheme for a reduced phase space quantization of Gravity has been developed by Thomas Thiemann. However it is not fully equivalent to the Dirac quantization as the \`clock-variables' must be taken to be classical in the reduced phase space quantization, as opposed to the case in the Dirac quantization. A common misunderstanding is that coordinate transformations are the gauge symmetries of general relativity, when actually the true gauge symmetries are diffeomorphisms as defined by a mathematician (see the Hole argument) – which are much more radical. The first class constraints of general relativity are the spatial diffeomorphism constraint and the Hamiltonian constraint (also known as the Wheeler-De Witt equation) and imprint the spatial and temporal diffeomorphism invariance of the theory respectively. Imposing these constraints classically are basically admissibility conditions on the initial data, also they generate the \`evolution' equations (really gauge transformations) via the Poisson bracket. Importantly the Poisson bracket algebra between the constraints fully determines the classical theory – this is something that must in some way be reproduced in the semi-classical limit of canonical quantum gravity for it to be a viable theory of quantum gravity. In Dirac's approach it turns out that the first class quantum constraints imposed on a wavefunction also generate gauge transformations. Thus the two step process in the classical theory of solving the constraints C_I = 0 (equivalent to solving the admissibility conditions for the initial data) and looking for the gauge orbits (solving the \`evolution' equations) is replaced by a one step process in the quantum theory, namely looking for solutions \\\\Psi of the quantum equations \\\\hat{C}_I \\\\Psi = 0. This is because it obviously solves the constraint at the quantum level and it simultaneously looks for states that are gauge invariant because \\\\hat{C}_I is the quantum generator of gauge transformations. At the classical level, solving the admissibility conditions and evolution equations are equivalent to solving all of Einstein's field equations, this underlines the central role of the quantum constraint equations in Dirac's approach to canonical quantum gravity.  Canonical quantization, diffeomorphism invariance and manifest finiteness  A diffeomorphism can be thought of as simultaneously \`dragging' the metric (gravitational field) and matter fields over the bare manifold while staying in the same coordinate system, and so are more radical than invariance under a mere coordinate transformation. This symmetry arises from the subtle requirement that the laws of general relativity cannot depend on any a-priori given space-time geometry. This diffeomorphism invariance has an important implication: canonical quantum gravity will be manifestly finite as the ability to \`drag' the metric function over the bare manifold means that small and large \`distances' between abstractly defined coordinate points are gauge- equivalent! A more rigorous argument has been provided by Lee Smolin: “A background independent operator must always be finite. This is because the regulator scale and the background metric are always introduced together in the regularization procedure. This is necessary, because the scale that the regularization parameter refers to must be described in terms of a background metric or coordinate chart introduced in the construction of the regulated operator. Because of this the dependence of the regulated operator on the cutoff, or regulator parameter, is related to its dependence on the background metric. When one takes the limit of the regulator parameter going to zero one isolates the non-vanishing terms. If these have any dependence on the regulator parameter (which would be the case if the term is blowing up) then it must also have dependence on the background metric. Conversely, if the terms that are nonvanishing in the limit the regulator is removed have no dependence on the background metric, it must be finite.” In fact, as mentioned below, Thomas Thiemann has explicitly demonstrated that loop quantum gravity (a well developed version of canonical quantum gravity) is manifestly finite even in the presence of all forms of matter! So there is no need for renormalization and the elimination of infinities. In perturbative quantum gravity (from which the non-renormalization arguments originate), as with any perturbative scheme, one makes the assumption that the unperturbed starting point is qualitatively the same as the true quantum state – so perturbative quantum gravity makes the physically unwarranted assumption that the true structure of quantum space-time can be approximated by a smooth classical (usually Minkowski) spacetime. Canonical quantum gravity on the other hand makes no such assumption and instead allows the theory itself tell you, in principle, what the true structure of quantum space-time is. A long-held expectation is that in a theory of quantum geometry such as canonical quantum gravity that geometric quantities such as area and volume become quantum observables and take non-zero discrete values, providing a natural regulator which eliminates infinities from the theory including those coming from matter contributions. This \`quantization' of geometric observables is in fact realized in loop quantum gravity (LQG).  Canonical quantization in metric variables  The quantization is based on decomposing the metric tensor as follows, : g_{\\\\mu u}dx^\\\\mu \\\\, dx^ u =(-\\\\,N^2+\\\\beta_k\\\\beta^k)dt^2+2\\\\beta_k \\\\, dx^k \\\\, dt+\\\\gamma_{ij} \\\\, dx^i \\\\, dx^j where the summation over repeated indices is implied, the index 0 denotes time \\\\tau=x^0, Greek indices run over all values 0, . . ., ,3 and Latin indices run over spatial values 1, . . ., 3\\\\. The function N is called the lapse function and the functions \\\\beta_k are called the shift functions. The spatial indices are raised and lowered using the spatial metric \\\\gamma_{ij} and its inverse \\\\gamma^{ij}: \\\\gamma_{ij}\\\\gamma^{jk}=\\\\delta_i{}^k and \\\\beta^i=\\\\gamma^{ij}\\\\beta_j, \\\\gamma=\\\\det\\\\gamma_{ij}, where \\\\delta is the Kronecker delta. Under this decomposition the Einstein–Hilbert Lagrangian becomes, up to total derivatives, : L=\\\\int d^3x\\\\,N\\\\gamma^{1/2}(K_{ij}K^{ij}-K^2+{}^{(3)}R) where {}^{(3)}R is the spatial scalar curvature computed with respect to the Riemannian metric \\\\gamma_{ij} and K_{ij} is the extrinsic curvature, :K_{ij}= -\\\\frac{1}{2}(\\\\mathcal{L}_{n}\\\\gamma)_{ij} =\\\\frac{1}{2}N^{-1}\\\\left( abla_j\\\\beta_i+ abla_i\\\\beta_j-\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\gamma_{ij}}{\\\\partial t}\\\\right), where \\\\mathcal{L} denotes Lie-differentiation, n is the unit normal to surfaces of constant t and abla_i denotes covariant differentiation with respect to the metric \\\\gamma_{ij}. Note that \\\\gamma_{\\\\mu u} = g_{\\\\mu u} + n_{\\\\mu}n_{ u} . DeWitt writes that the Lagrangian \\"has the classic form 'kinetic energy minus potential energy,' with the extrinsic curvature playing the role of kinetic energy and the negative of the intrinsic curvature that of potential energy.\\" While this form of the Lagrangian is manifestly invariant under redefinition of the spatial coordinates, it makes general covariance opaque. Since the lapse function and shift functions may be eliminated by a gauge transformation, they do not represent physical degrees of freedom. This is indicated in moving to the Hamiltonian formalism by the fact that their conjugate momenta, respectively \\\\pi and \\\\pi^i, vanish identically (on shell and off shell). These are called primary constraints by Dirac. A popular choice of gauge, called synchronous gauge, is N=1 and \\\\beta_i=0, although they can, in principle, be chosen to be any function of the coordinates. In this case, the Hamiltonian takes the form :H=\\\\int d^3x\\\\mathcal{H}, where :\\\\mathcal{H}=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\gamma^{-1/2}(\\\\gamma_{ik}\\\\gamma_{jl}+\\\\gamma_{il}\\\\gamma_{jk}-\\\\gamma_{ij}\\\\gamma_{kl})\\\\pi^{ij}\\\\pi^{kl}-\\\\gamma^{1/2}{}^{(3)}R and \\\\pi^{ij} is the momentum conjugate to \\\\gamma_{ij}. Einstein's equations may be recovered by taking Poisson brackets with the Hamiltonian. Additional on-shell constraints, called secondary constraints by Dirac, arise from the consistency of the Poisson bracket algebra. These are \\\\mathcal{H}=0 and abla_j\\\\pi^{ij}=0. This is the theory which is being quantized in approaches to canonical quantum gravity. It can be shown that six Einstein equations describing time evolution (really a gauge transformation) can be obtained by calculating the Poisson brackets of the three-metric and its conjugate momentum with a linear combination of the spatial diffeomorphism and Hamiltonian constraint. The vanishing of the constraints, giving the physical phase space, are the four other Einstein equations. That is, we have: Spatial diffeomorphisms constraints : C_a (x) = 0 of which there are an infinite number – one for value of x, can be smeared by the so-called shift functions \\\\vec{N} (x) to give an equivalent set of smeared spatial diffeomorphism constraints, : C (\\\\vec{N}) = \\\\int d^3 x \\\\, C_a (x) N^a (x). These generate spatial diffeomorphisms along orbits defined by the shift function N^a (x). Hamiltonian constraints : H (x) = 0 of which there are an infinite number, can be smeared by the so-called lapse functions N (x) to give an equivalent set of smeared Hamiltonian constraints, : H (N) = \\\\int d^3 x \\\\, H (x) N (x). as mentioned above, the Poisson bracket structure between the (smeared) constraints is important because they fully determine the classical theory, and must be reproduced in the semi-classical limit of any theory of quantum gravity.  The Wheeler–De-Witt equation  Hamiltonian constraint of LQG The Wheeler-De-Witt equation (sometimes called the Hamiltonian constraint, sometimes the Einstein-Schrödinger equation) is rather central as it encodes the dynamics at the quantum level. It is analogous to Schrödinger's equation, except as the time coordinate, t, is unphysical, a physical wavefunction can't depend on t and hence \`Schrödinger's equation' reduces to a constraint: : \\\\hat{H} \\\\Psi = 0. Using metric variables lead to seemingly un-summountable mathematical difficulties when trying to promote the classical expression to a well-defined quantum operator, and as such decades went by without making progress via this approach. This problem was circumvented and the formulation of a well-defined Wheeler-De-Witt equation was first accomplished with the introduction of Ashtekar-Barbero variables and the loop representation, this well defined operator formulated by Thomas Thiemann. Before this development the Wheeler-De-Witt equation had only been formulated in symmetry-reduced models, such as quantum cosmology.  Canonical quantization in Ashtekar–Barbero variables and LQG  Many of the technical problems in canonical quantum gravity revolve around the constraints. Canonical general relativity was originally formulated in terms of metric variables, but there seemed to be insurmountable mathematical difficulties in promoting the constraints to quantum operators because of their highly non-linear dependence on the canonical variables. The equations were much simplified with the introduction of Ashtekars new variables. Ashtekar variables describe canonical general relativity in terms of a new pair canonical variables closer to that of gauge theories. In doing so it introduced an additional constraint, on top of the spatial diffeomorphism and Hamiltonian constraint, the Gauss gauge constraint. The loop representation is a quantum hamiltonian representation of gauge theories in terms of loops. The aim of the loop representation, in the context of Yang-Mills theories is to avoid the redundancy introduced by Gauss gauge symmetries allowing to work directly in the space of Gauss gauge invariant states. The use of this representation arose naturally from the Ashtekar-Barbero representation as it provides an exact non-perturbative description and also because the spatial diffeomorphism constraint is easily dealt with within this representation. Within the loop representation Thiemann has provided a well defined canonical theory in the presence of all forms of matter and explicitly demonstrated it to be manifestly finite! So there is no need for renormalization. However, as LQG approach is well suited to describe physics at the Planck scale, there are difficulties in making contact with familiar low energy physics and establishing it has the correct semi-classical limit.  The problem of time  All canonical theories of general relativity have to deal with the problem of time. In quantum gravity, the problem of time is a conceptual conflict between general relativity and quantum mechanics. In canonical general relativity, time is just another coordinate as a result of general covariance. In quantum field theories, especially in the Hamiltonian formulation, the formulation is split between three dimensions of space, and one dimension of time. Roughly speaking, the problem of time is that there is none in general relativity. This is because in general relativity the Hamiltonian is a constraint that must vanish. However, in any canonical theory, the Hamiltonian generates time translations. Therefore, we arrive at the conclusion that \\"nothing moves\\" (\\"there is no time\\") in general relativity. Since \\"there is no time\\", the usual interpretation of quantum mechanics measurements at given moments of time breaks down. This problem of time is the broad banner for all interpretational problems of the formalism.  The problem of quantum cosmology  The problem of quantum cosmology is that the physical states that solve the constraints of canonical quantum gravity represent quantum states of the entire universe and as such exclude an outside observer, however an outside observer is a crucial element in most interpretations of quantum mechanics.

Hohmann was the 40th Chief of the L.A.P.D., succeeding acting Chief David A. Davidson in July 1939. He previously had been a lieutenant. Becoming Chief Los Angeles Mayor Fletcher Bowron had preferred that Captain R.R. McDonald become chief, but he left the decision up the Police Commission, which decided to base the appointment on merit. The civil service exam for chief was a two part test, which was traditional with the L.A.P.D., when testing was first implemented for promotions. The first part of an L.A.P.D. civil service exam was written, which accounted for 95% of the score, followed by an oral exam. Those who took the test were given a score and placed on a promotion list, off of which promotions were supposed to be made. In 1939, Mayor Bowron, a reformer who had closed down 600 bordellos in L.A. after assuming office in a drive against corruption, and his Police Commission had all the extant promotion lists jettisoned and new round of testing implemented. The office of chief was officially put up for grabs, and acting chief Davidson declined to test for it. The written exam for chief was undertaken by 175 candidates. Of these, 31 qualified to take an oral examination. Lieutenant Hohmann placed first on the list of candidates and thus won the position, which surprised many. (Acting Captain William H. Parker, a future police chief who is credited with cleaning up the L.A.P.D. during the 1950s, placed eighth.) Mayor Bowron appointed Hohmann chief as the official selection of the Police Commission. The members of the Commission had been personally appointed by Bowron. Reassignment Hohmann's reign as L.A.P.D chief was brief. During his time as chief, he created a new headquarters division, which he himself personally oversaw with Captain McDonald as his administrative officer. He was succeeded by Clemence B. Horrall on June 16, 1941, after he voluntarily took a demotion to deputy chief after he had become ensnared in a police corruption trial that had embarrassed Mayor Fletcher Bowron. Once Horrall became chief, he demoted his former mentor to lieutenant. After accepting the demotion, Hohmann sued the L.A.P.D. to get his rank restored. The police corruption trial and Hohmann's struggles with Horrall further upset an already demoralized police force. Ironically, Horrall himself would resign as chief in 1949, when he too became ensnared in a police corruption scandal during the Brenda Allen vice scandal. Horrall had become chief when Hohman, under pressure from Los Angeles Mayor Fletcher Bowron, stepped down.

Produced by Harold Battiste, it was released on Atco Records in 1968. The musical style of Gris-Gris is a hybrid of New Orleans rhythm and blues and psychedelic rock. Despite the New Orleans style, it was recorded in California, albeit with several native New Orleans musicians. Gris-Gris failed to chart in the United Kingdom and the United States. It was re-issued on compact disc decades later and received much greater praise from modern critics, including being listed at #143 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Production Before recording the album, Rebennack was an experienced New Orleans R&B; and rock musician playing as a session musician, songwriter, and producer in New Orleans. Due to drug problems and the law, Rebennack moved to Los Angeles in 1965, joining a group of New Orleans session musicians. Rebennack survived by playing with various pop and rock recording sessions, receiving much of this work with the help of New Orleanian arranger Harold Battiste. Rebennack desired to make an album that combined the various strains of New Orleans music behind a front man called Dr. John, after a black man named Dr. John Montaine, who claimed to be an African potentate. Rebennack chose this name after hearing about Montaine from his sister, and feeling a \\"spiritual kinship\\" with him. Rebennack originally wanted New Orleans singer Ronnie Barron to front the band as the Dr. John character, but Don Costa, who managed Barron at the time, advised him against it, claiming it to be a bad career move. Rebennack took on the Dr. John stage name himself. Gris-Gris was recorded at Gold Star Studios in Los Angeles, California. With an album due and no singer prepared, Dr. John managed to book studio time originally reserved for Sonny & Cher. Release and reception Gris-Gris was released in 1968 on Atco Records, a sub-label of Atlantic Records. Atlantic records president Ahmet Ertegun was reluctant to release the record at first, exclaiming \\"How can we market this boogaloo crap?\\". Gris-Gris failed to chart in the United States and United Kingdom. Modern reception of the album has been very positive. Richie Unterberger of Allmusic gave the album five out of five stars, referring to it as \\"The most exploratory and psychedelic outing of Dr. John's career\\".

Its international popularity peaked in the 1930s, and it has been continually enjoyed since. History Following World War I, a number of American expatriates settled in Paris and began to build up a jazz scene. France did not suffer from racial discrimination as much as the US, so a mixture of musical styles from different cultures began to emerge. As with Brazil, the French were at first concerned it was too American of an influence before \\"making it their own.\\" Although in the case of the French the adjustment proved faster as by the 1930s jazz had become acceptable. Between the 1930s and 1950s, the biguine, a style of jazz from the French Caribbean was popular among dance orchestras. Lacking recognition at home, several biguine artists from Martinique moved to mainland France, where they achieved greater popularity in Paris, especially in the wake of the colonial exhibition in 1931. Early stars like Alexandre Stellio and Sam Castandet became popular in Paris. An important event in that is the creation of the Quintette du Hot Club de France in 1934. This is among the most significant jazz groups in European history. Starting in the late 1940s the Le Caveau de la Huchette would become an important place for French and American jazz musicians. Many American jazz artists have lived in France from Sidney Bechet to Archie Shepp. These Americans would have an influence on French jazz, but at the same time French jazz had its own inspirations as well. For example, Bal-musette had some influence on France's form of Gypsy jazz. Similarly, the violin, and to an extent the guitar, were traditionally more popular in French jazz than American. Related to that, Jean-Luc Ponty and Stéphane Grappelli are among the most well-respected violinists in the history of jazz. That stated, the violin is also popular in Eastern European jazz.

As an independent and neutral employee, the organizational ombudsman ideally should have no other role or duties. This is in order to maintain independence and neutrality, and to prevent real or perceived conflicts of interest. Using an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) sensibility, an organizational ombudsman provides options for people with concerns, including whistleblowers, who seek to bring their concerns forward safely and effectively. Additionally, an organizational ombudsman offers coaching on ethics and other management issues, provides mediation to facilitate conflict resolution, helps enable safe upward feedback, assists those who feel harassed and discriminated against. Overall, the organizational ombudsman helps employees and managers navigate bureaucracy and deal with concerns and complaints. The organizational ombudsman role has evolved from at least two sources: a) an evolution from the concept of the 'classical' ombudsman and b) a spontaneous creation and re- inventionof the idea of an internal, neutral conflict resolveroften by senior managers who had never heard of the classical model. Evolution from the classical model: the classical ombudsman appeared in Sweden in the early 19th century as an independent high-level public official responsible to the parliament or legislature and appointed by constitutional or legislative provisions to monitor the administrative activities of government. This model has been copied and also adapted in many ways in many countries and milieus. The spontaneous creation model: the organizational ombudsman role has also been regularly \\"re-invented\\" by employers who did not know of the classical ombudsman but valued the importance of a senior manager who is a neutral, independent, confidential and informal problem-solver and systems change agent. Examples appeared in the 1920s in the US and probably appeared here and there in many cultures. In many organizations the organizational ombudsman is seen as part of a complaint system or link to a complaint system, but the office is intended to function, and to appear to function, independently from all regular line and staff managementand to report to the CEO or Board of Directors. The concept has been widely implemented, and has been spread around the globe, with many corporations, universities, government and non-government entities establishing organizational ombudsman programs. Impartial third party role Currently, the role is considered by some as a hallmark of an ethical organization and a key component of an integrated dispute resolution system, or complaint system. Sometimes referred to as the ultimate 'inside- outsider', an organizational Ombudsman adheres to professional standards strictly governing their confidentiality and neutrality. By virtue of their protected and highly placed internal role (e.g., reporting to a board of directors rather than to line or staff management), they can be particularly effective at working long-term with management to help effect change in policies, procedures, systems or structures that are problematic for employees or inefficient for the organization. Associations and professional standards The International Ombudsman Institute supports ombudsmen institutions to cooperate. The umbrella professional association for organizational ombudsmen is the International Ombudsman Association, which provides training and establishes standards of practice. Other non-profit think tanks, such as the Institute for Collaborative Engagement, have strongly supported the work and growth of the profession, as has the American Bar Association, through its support of standards and guidelines to establish organizational ombudsman offices. Specific examples Universities appoint ombudsmen to handle student and staff complaints and grievances.http://www.miami.edu/sa/index.php/ombudsperson/ Retrieved 2013-10-29http://ombudsman.cornell.edu/ Retrieved 2009-11-15 Corporations and businesses contract or hire an ombudsman to enable businesses and organizations to realize their goals. Some practitioners are certified mediators from organizations such as The Center for Dispute Resolution. Other practitioners have received a masters or Ph.D. in programs such as Mediation and Conflict Studies. In this case study involving a home services organization,http://www.resologics.com/impact-studies/2015/9/1/impact-study- home-services-organization the organization used an Ombuds Office for monitoring, reporting, conflict resolution and engagement. Team coaching tools were deployed as well. In a case study involving a manufacturing business,http://www.resologics.com/impact-studies/2014/10/29/impact-study- manufacturing the role of the ombudsperson included mediation, coaching individuals within the team, coaching with leadership to discover overall goals, team diagnostic assessments, ongoing team coaching centered on organizational culture, communications, team agreements, etc., and finally, training in conflict awareness.

It calls for increased focus on education, and recognizes the lifelong efforts of the Rebbe for education. Since 1978, Education & Sharing Day, USA has been proclaimed annually by the President on the Rebbe's birthday on the Jewish calendar (11 Nissan), which is four days before Passover and thus generally can fall between March 21 and April 21 on the Gregorian calendar. History In 1978, the U.S. Congress asked President Carter to designate the Rebbe's birthday as the national Education and Sharing Day to recognize and pay tribute to his efforts for a better education for all American citizens. The Rebbe was an advocate for children and spoke about the need for each child to be given an education that would offer them the opportunities to succeed. He spoke about the need for education to focus not only on academic achievements but also on character building. The Rebbe's emissaries established a network of several thousand Jewish schools and educational centers in the United States and across the globe. The Rebbe often argued that the most important part of a child's education is instilling in him or her \\"[awareness of] a Supreme Being and a Law higher than man’s\\" or \\"fear or love of a force greater than man\\". To honor these accomplishments, his birth date has since been commemorated as Education & Sharing Day, U.S.A., by Congress and the President.Joseph Telushkin, Rebbe: The Life and Teachings of Menachem M. Schneerson, the Most Influential Rabbi in Modern History. HarperCollins, 2014. pp.30–36.Fishkoff, Sue. The Rebbe's Army, Schoken, 2003 (08052 11381). Page 192. Each year on that day, the President issues a proclamation which calls on American citizens to follow the example set by The Rebbe and focus on education and betterment of society. The goal of Education and Sharing Day, in the Rebbe's words, is to: \\"Put greater emphasis on the promotion of fundamental human rights and obligations of justice and morality, which are the basis of any human society, if it is to be truly human and not turn into a jungle.\\" It stresses the need for mindfulness in the general education system. The Rebbe called for local governing bodies and schools to join the call and attention given to this day, and to make a point out of it around the country and around the world, to the point, the Rebbe envisioned, it will become a nationally celebrated day, the same way Mother's Day and Father's day are celebrated. There has been a recent movement to proclaim local Education and Sharing Days in States and Cities across the United States to correspond to the national occurrence. Education Day 2018 had the distinction of being proclaimed at the state level in all 50 States by the respective Governors or State Legislatures, in addition to the usual national proclamation by the President.  Excerpts of texts of proclamations  President Ronald Reagan wrote in his proclamation of 1982: > One shining example for people of all faiths of what education ought to be > is that provided by the Lubavitch movement, headed by Rabbi Menachem > Schneerson, a worldwide spiritual leader who will celebrate his 80th > birthday on April 4, 1982.

The L.A.P.D. employed 800 duly sworn police officers.

L.A.P.D. intelligence operatives were bolstered with private investigators, who were given captain's badges. The L.A. City Council eventually disbanded the intelligence operation after three years.

Despite being less well-known than his fellow gang members, he has since been referred to as \\"the wildest of the Wild Bunch\\", having reputedly killed at least nine law enforcement officers in five shootings and another two men in other instances. He was involved in numerous shootouts with police and civilians and participated in several bank and train robberies with various gangs during his outlaw days. Early life Logan was born in Richland Township, Tama County, Iowa in 1867. His mother died in 1876, and his brothers, Hank, Johnny and Lonny, moved to Dodson, Missouri to live with their aunt Lee Logan. Until at least 1883, Harvey made his living breaking horses on the Cross L ranch, near Rising Star, Texas. While there, he met and befriended a man named \\"Flat Nose\\" George Curry, from whom he took his new last name. His brothers soon adopted the same last name. The Logan brothers were known as hard workers until they got paid. Money did not stay in their pockets for long. They all had a taste for alcohol and women. Kid Curry would often return from a train or bank robbery, get drunk and lay up with prostitutes until his share of the take was gone. After Kid Curry became famous, the prostitutes would frequently name him as the father when they became pregnant. The children were referred to as \\"Curry Kids\\". It is believed that Kid Curry was credited with as many as eighty-five children, though the number of children he actually fathered was probably fewer than five. Descendants of the \\"Curry Kids\\" remain scattered throughout Eastland County, Texas and the surrounding areas to this day. In 1883, Curry rode as a cowboy on a cattle drive to Pueblo, Colorado. While in Pueblo, he was involved in a saloon brawl. To avoid arrest, he fled, settling in southern Wyoming, where he began work at the \\"Circle Diamond\\" ranch. By all accounts, when sober, Curry was mild-mannered, likable, and loyal to both his friends and brothers. Outlaw life The events that changed the course of his life began when his brother Hank and friend Jim Thornhill bought a ranch at Rock Creek, in what was then Chouteau County, Montana (now Phillips County). The ranch was near the site of a mine strike made by local miner and lawman Powell \\"Pike\\" Landusky. Landusky, according to some reports of the day, confronted Curry and attacked him, believing Curry was involved romantically with Landusky's daughter, Elfie. Landusky then filed assault charges against Curry, who was arrested and beaten [by whom?]. Two friends of Curry's, A.S. Lohman and Frank Plunkett, paid a $500 bond for Curry's release. Landusky's daughter, Elfie, later claimed it was Curry's brother, Lonny, with whom she had been involved. However, the confession came much too late. On December 27, 1894, Curry caught Landusky at a local saloon and hit Landusky, stunning him. Curry, evidently believing the fight was over, began walking away. Landusky pulled his pistol and began threatening Curry, who was unarmed. Curry's friend and his brother's partner, Jim Thornhill, gave Curry his pistol. Landusky's gun jammed and Curry shot him dead. Curry was arrested but was released at an inquest when it was judged that he acted in self-defense. However, a formal trial was set. Curry believed he would not get a fair trial because the judge was close friends with Landusky. For this reason, Curry left town. Riding with the Black Jack Ketchum gang Curry started riding with outlaw Tom \\"Black Jack\\" Ketchum. Pinkerton detectives began trailing Curry shortly after his departure from Montana. In January 1896, Curry received word that an old friend of Landusky's, rancher James Winters, had been spying on him for the reward offered in his arrest. Curry and two of his brothers, Johnny and Lonny, went to Winters' ranch to confront him. However, a shootout erupted. Johnny was killed, while Curry and Lonny escaped. Shortly after, Curry and Lonny argued with Black Jack Ketchum over the take in a train robbery. The two brothers left the gang and joined the circus. Forming his own gang The brothers then received employment on a cattle ranch, arranged by their cousin, Bob Lee, near Sand Gulch, Colorado. Pinkerton agents trailing Curry gave up his trail briefly. Curry, Lonny, Walt Putnam and George Curry formed their own gang around this time. Curry temporarily left Colorado, intending to scout good targets for potential robberies. On April 15, 1897, Curry was reportedly involved in the killing of Deputy Sheriff William Deane of Powder River, Wyoming, as he and his gang gathered fresh horses on a ranch in the Powder River Basin. After this, he returned to Colorado to the ranch where he was working. By June 1897, the cowboy job had ended, and Curry ventured north with the rest of the gang. They robbed a bank in Belle Fourche, South Dakota, and met resistance outside the bank from the townspeople. One of their friends, Tom O'Day, was captured when his horse spooked and ran away without him. The others escaped, but while planning a second robbery a posse from the town caught up with them in Fergus County, Montana. During a shootout, Curry was shot through the wrist, and his horse was shot from under him, resulting in his capture. George Curry and Walt Putnam were also captured. All three were held in the Deadwood, South Dakota jail, but only briefly; they overpowered the jailer and escaped. They headed back into Montana and robbed two post offices. Riding with Butch Cassidy and the Wild Bunch During this time Curry began riding with Butch Cassidy's Wild Bunch gang. On June 2, 1899, the gang robbed the Union Pacific Railroad Overland Flyer passenger train near Wilcox, Wyoming, a robbery that became famous. Many notable lawmen of the day took part in the hunt for the robbers, but they were not captured. During one shootout with lawmen following that robbery, Kid Curry and George Curry shot and killed Converse County Sheriff Joe Hazen. Tom Horn, a noted killer-for- hire and contract employee of the Pinkerton Agency, obtained information from explosives expert Bill Speck that identified George Curry and Kid Curry as Hazen's murderers, which Horn passed on to Pinkerton detective Charlie Siringo. The gang escaped into its hideout at the Hole-in-the-Wall. Curry and the Sundance Kid may have used a log cabin, now preserved at Old Trail Town in Cody, Wyoming, as a hideout while planning to rob a bank in Red Lodge, Montana. However, they never robbed the Red Lodge bank and the Sundance Kid's participation has never been proven. Butch Cassidy, the Sundance Kid, and other desperados met at another cabin brought to Old Trail Town from the Hole- in-the-Wall country in north-central Wyoming. It was built in 1883 by Alexander Ghent. Siringo had been assigned the task of bringing in the outlaw gang. He became friends with Elfie Landusky. Elfie was using the last name of Curry, alleging that Lonny Curry had got her pregnant. Through her, Siringo intended to locate the gang. Siringo changed his name to Charles L. Carter, disguised himself as an on-the-run gunman, and began mingling with people who might know the Currys, becoming friends with Jim Thornhill. Logan with Della Moore However, Kid Curry was hiding in Robbers Roost, another hideout used by the Wild Bunch in the remote canyon country of Utah. Curry then went to Alma, New Mexico, with Cassidy and others, intending to hide for a while. On July 11, 1899, while working at the W.S. Ranch, Curry robbed a Colorado and Southern Railroad train near Folsom, New Mexico with gang members Elzy Lay and Sam Ketchum, the brother of Tom \\"Black Jack\\" Ketchum. A posse led by Huerfano County, Colorado Sheriff Ed Farr cornered the gang near an area called Turkey Creek, which resulted in two gun battles over a period of four days. Lay and Ketchum were both wounded and later captured, with Lay killing the sheriff and mortally wounding Colfax County Deputy Henry Love in the process. Ketchum died from his wounds days later while in custody, and Lay received a life sentence for the murders. Curry escaped, but he, Cassidy, and other members of the gang were forced to leave New Mexico. Curry traveled to San Antonio, where he stayed briefly. While there he met prostitute Della Moore (also known as Annie Rogers or Maude Williams), with whom he became romantically involved. At the time of their meeting, she was working in Madame Fannie Porter's brothel, which was a regular hideout for the Wild Bunch gang. Revenge killings On February 28, 1900, lawmen attempted to arrest Lonny Curry at his aunt's home. Lonny was killed in the shootout that followed, and his cousin Bob Lee was arrested for rustling and sent to prison in Wyoming. Kid Curry was now the last surviving Logan brother. Meanwhile, Curry was identified in St. Johns, Arizona as he was passing notes suspected of being from the Wilcox robbery. Local Apache County Sheriff Edward Beeler gathered a posse and began tracking Curry, who was accompanied by Bill \\"News\\" Carver. The posse shot it out with Curry and Carver on March 28. Curry and Carver killed Deputy Andrew Gibbons and Deputy Frank LeSueur. On May 26, Kid Curry rode into Utah and killed Grand County Sheriff Jesse Tyler and Deputy Sam Jenkins in a brazen shootout in Moab. Both killings were in retaliation for Tyler and Jenkins having killed George Curry and his brother Lonny. Curry then returned to the Wild Bunch. On August 29, 1900, they robbed Union Pacific train No. 3 near Tipton, Wyoming, from which newspaper stories claimed the gang got more than $55,000. The gang again split up, with Kid Curry and Ben Kilpatrick heading south to Fort Worth, Texas, while Cassidy, the Sundance Kid, and Bill Carver immediately pulled off another robbery in Winnemucca, Nevada. The dynamited Great Northern express car robbed July 3, 1901 Siringo, still working the case for the Pinkertons, was in Circleville, Utah, where Butch Cassidy had been raised. Curry rejoined the gang, and they hit a Great Northern train near Wagner, Montana on July 3. This time, they took over $60,000 in cash. Gang member Bill Carver was killed in Sonora, Texas by Sutton County Sheriff Elijah Briant during the pursuit following that robbery. Again the gang split up. In October 1901, Della Moore was arrested in Nashville, Tennessee for passing money tied to an earlier robbery involving Curry. On November 5 and 6, gang members Ben Kilpatrick and Laura Bullion were captured in St. Louis, Missouri. On December 13, Kid Curry shot Knoxville, Tennessee policemen William Dinwiddle and Robert Saylor in a shootout and escaped. Despite being pursued by Pinkerton agents and other law enforcement officials, Curry returned to Montana, where he shot and killed rancher James Winters, who was responsible for the killing of his brother Johnny years before. Capture, escape, and death Curry then traveled back to Knoxville. In a pool hall on November 30, 1902, Curry was captured after a lengthy physical fight with lawmen. He was convicted of robbery because facts in the murder of the two policemen were not definite and no witnesses would testify, and he received a sentence of 20 years of hard labor and a $5,000 fine. On June 27, 1903, Curry escaped. Rumors that a deputy had received an $8,000 bribe to allow his escape spread, but this was never proven. On June 7, 1904, Kid Curry was tracked down by a posse outside of Parachute, Colorado. Curry and two others had robbed a Denver and Rio Grande train outside Parachute. As they escaped, they stole fresh horses owned by Roll Gardner and a neighbour. The next morning, when they discovered their horses had been stolen, Gardner and the neighbour set out in pursuit of the gang. They joined up with a posse and continued tracking the outlaws. The gang shot Gardner's and his neighbour's horses from under them; Gardner found cover while his neighbour started running. Kid Curry took aim at the neighbour and Gardner shot Curry. The wounded Curry decided to end it at that time, and fatally shot himself in the head to avoid capture. The other two robbers escaped. The rifle Gardner used is still in the family today. Rumors persist that Curry was not killed in Parachute and was misidentified, having actually departed for South America with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Charlie Siringo resigned from the Pinkertons, believing they got the wrong man. Curry is buried in Pioneer (Linwood) Cemetery overlooking Glenwood Springs, Colorado, a short distance from fellow gunfighter Doc Holliday's memorial. In popular culture Curry appears as a character in Mr American by George MacDonald Fraser. The novel, set in 1909, uses the controversy surrounding Curry's death to portray him as surviving the shootout near Parachute and later tracking the novel's protagonist, Mark Franklin, to England, where Curry attempts to kill Franklin. Phillip Pine played Kid Curry in the episode \\"Kid Curry\\" on the TV series Tales of Wells Fargo (1959). Ted Cassidy played Curry in the 1969 film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Ben Murphy portrayed a fictionalised Kid Curry in the 1970s television show Alias Smith and Jones. The MythBusters tested the claim that Curry could drop a silver dollar off his hand and then draw and fire five shots from his revolver before it hit the ground. They found the claim to be highly unlikely. Curry appears in the video game Call of Juarez: Gunslinger and is a boss-level duel opponent. In 2015, Rocky Mountain Distilling + Bottling located in West Valley City, Utah began producing Kid Curry Vodka. In 2016, Kid Curry Silver Rum was released by the same company.

Dinoprostone is used in labor induction, bleeding after delivery, termination of pregnancy, and in newborn babies to keep the ductus arteriosus open. In babies it is used in those with congenital heart defects until surgery can be carried out. It is also used to manage gestational trophoblastic disease. It may be used within the vagina or by injection into a vein. PGE2 synthesis within the body begins with the activation of arachidonic acid (AA) by the enzyme phospholipase A2. Once activated, AA is oxygenated by cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes to form prostaglandin endoperoxides. Specifically, prostaglandin G2 (PGG2) is modified by the peroxidase moiety of the COX enzyme to produce prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) which is then converted to PGE2. Common side effects of PGE2 include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and excessive uterine contraction. In babies there may be decreased breathing and low blood pressure. Caution should be taken in people with asthma or glaucoma and it is not recommended in those who have had a prior C-section. It works by binding and activating the prostaglandin E2 receptor which results in the opening and softening of the cervix and dilation of blood vessels. Prostaglandin E2 was first synthesized in 1970 and approved for medical use by the FDA in the United States in 1977. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Prostaglandin E2 works as well as prostaglandin E1 in babies. Physiological effects Dinoprostone has important effects in labor by inducing softening of the cervix and causing uterine contraction, and also stimulates osteoblasts to release factors that stimulate bone resorption by osteoclasts. Natural prostaglandins, including PGE1 and PGE2, are important in the structure and function of the ductus arteriosis in fetuses and newborns. They allow the ductus arteriosis to remain open, providing the necessary connection between the pulmonary artery and descending aorta that allows the blood to bypass the fetus's underdeveloped lungs and be transported to the placenta for oxygenation. The ductus arteriosis normally begins to close upon birth due to an increase of PGE2 metabolism, but in newborns with congenital heart disease, prostaglandins can be used to keep the ductus arteriosis open longer than normal to sustain healthy oxygen saturation levels in the blood. Although PGE1 is more commonly used in this setting, there has been a report of oral PGE2 being used to treat ductus-dependent congenital heart diseases in newborns to delay surgical treatment until the pulmonary arteries grew. In addition, PGE2 was used in another report to dilate the ductus arteriosis in newborns with various cardiovascular defects to allow for better perfusion of the lungs and kidneys. On the other hand, the post-partal synthesis of PGE2 in newborns is considered one cause of patent ductus arteriosus. The aerosol form of PGE2 serves as a bronchodilator, but its use in this setting is limited by the fact that it also causes coughing. PGE2, similarly to PGE1, acts as a direct vasodilator by acting on smooth muscle to cause dilation of blood vessels. In addition, PGE2 inhibits platelet aggregation. PGE2 also suppresses T cell receptor signaling and proliferation, and may play a role in resolution of inflammation. In addition, PGE2 limits the immune response by preventing B-lymphocyte differentiation and their ability to present antigens. = Central and peripheral nervous systems effects = Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) has a variety of functions within the Central Nervous System and Peripheral Nervous System. When PGE2 interacts with EP3 receptors, it increases body temperature, resulting in fever. PGE2 is also a predominant prostanoid that contributes to inflammation via enhancing edema and leukocyte infiltration from increased vascular permeability (allowing more blood flow into an inflamed area of the body) when acting on EP2 receptors. The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) blocks the activity of COX-2, resulting in a decrease of PGE2 production. NSAIDs blocking COX-2 and decreasing the production of PGE2 remediates fever and inflammation. Additionally, PGE2 acting on EP1 and EP4 receptors are a component in feeling pain via inflammatory nociception. When PGE2 binds to EP1 and EP4 receptors, an increase in excitability via cation channels as well as inhibition of hyperpolarizing potassium (K+) channels, increase membrane excitability. As a result, this causes peripheral nerve endings to report painful stimuli. = Immunity = As mentioned previously, PGE2 contributes to the inflammation when bound to EP2 receptors. In terms of immunity, prostaglandins have the ability to regulate lymphocyte function. PGE2 affect T-lymphocyte formation by regulating apoptosis of immature thymocytes. In addition, it can suppress an immune response by inhibiting B lymphocytes from forming into antibody- secreting plasma cells. When this process is suppressed, it causes a decrease in a humoral antibody response because of the decrease in production of antibodies. PGE2 also has roles in inhibition of cytotoxic T-cell function, cell division of T-lymphocytes, and the development of TH1 lymphocytes. =Neurological effects= In response to physiologic and psychologic stress, prostaglandin E2 is involved in several inflammation and immunity pathways. As one of the most abundant prostaglandins in the body, Prostaglandin E2 is involved almost all typical inflammation markers such as redness, swelling, and pain. It regulates these responses through binding to G coupled protein prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) receptors (EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4). The activation of these different EP receptors is dependent on the type of triggering stress stimuli and results in the corresponding stress response. Activation of EP1 via PGE2 results in the suppression of impulse behaviors in response to psychological stress. Prostaglandin E2 is involved in regulating illness induced memory impairment via activation of EP2. Prostaglandin E2 activation of EP3 results in regulation of illness induced fever. EP4 is functionally similar to EP2 and has also been shown in studies to have a role in hypothermia and anorexia. Generally, prostaglandin E2, has been shown to increase psychological stress and impair memory. In addition to inflammatory effects, Prostaglandin E2 has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects as well, due to its different actions on varying receptors. = Smooth muscle effects = Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) serves a significant role in vascular smooth muscle tone regulation. It is a vasodilator produced by endothelial cells. It promotes vasodilation of smooth muscles by increasing the activity of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) to decrease intracellular calcium levels via the IP and EP4 receptors. Conversely, Prostaglandin E2 can also induce vasoconstriction via activation of EP1 and EP3 receptors, which activates the Ca2+ pathway and decreased cAMP activity. Within the gastrointestinal tract, PGE2 activates smooth muscles to cause contractions on longitudinal muscle when acting on EP3 receptors. In contrast, PGE2 effects on respiratory smooth muscle result in relaxation. = Kidney effects = Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), along with other prostaglandins, are synthesized within the cortex and medulla of the kidney. The role of renal COX-2-derived PGE2 within the kidney is to maintain renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) through localized vasodilation. COX-2-derived prostanoids work to increase medullary blood flow as well as inhibit sodium reabsorption within kidney tubules. PGE2 also assist the kidneys with systemic blood pressure control by modifying water and sodium excretion. In addition, it is also thought to activate EP4 or EP2 to increase renin release, resulting in an elevation of GFR and sodium retention to raise systemic blood pressure levels within the body.  Medical uses  = Cervical ripening = In the setting of labor and delivery, cervical ripening (also known as cervical effacement) is a natural process that occurs before labor, in which the cervix becomes softer, thinner, and dilated, enabling the fetus to pass through the cervix. A ripe cervix is favorable prior to induction of labor, which is a common obstetric practice, and increases the chances for a successful induction. Pharmacological methods are sometimes required to induce cervical ripening that does not occur naturally. The natural ripening of the cervix is mediated by prostaglandins, thus a common pharmacological method is to use external prostaglandins such as PGE2, or dinoprostone. PGE2 achieves cervical ripening and softening by stimulating uterine contractions as well as directly acting on the collagenase present in the cervix to soften it. There are currently two formulations of PGE2 analog available for use in cervical ripening: Prepidil, a vaginal gel, and Cervidil, a vaginal insert. PGE2 is similar to oxytocin in terms of successful labor induction and the time from induction to delivery. = Termination of intrauterine pregnancy = Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a common pharmacological method of termination of pregnancy, particularly in the second trimester or for missed abortion, which is a miscarriage in which the fetus did not evacuate the uterus. However, PGE2 is not feticidal, and only induces abortion by stimulating uterine contractions. It is recommended that 20 mg of dinoprostone vaginal suppository be administered every three to five hours to evacuate the uterus. The abortion should occur within 24 hours after the beginning of administration of dinoprostone; if it does not, dinoprostone should no longer be given and other interventions would be required, such as dilation and curettage. Side effects A common side effect of Prostaglandin E2 is its effect on gastrointestinal smooth muscle resulting in nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Other side effects include headache, shivering, and chills. The suppository form of Prostaglandin E2 is associated with increased severity of these symptoms. Fever is also a common side effect with use of prostaglandin E2. Administration of Prostaglandin E2 should be stopped if a person experiences side effects such as fever. The insert and gel forms have been shown to have minimal gastrointestinal effects, but are more associated with increase stimulation of the uterus as well as fetal distress. Uterine hyperstimulation is effectively treated by stopping use of Prostaglandin E2. Other monitoring parameters include sustained uterine contractions and fetal distress. In babies there may be decreased breathing and low blood pressure. Care should be taken in people with asthma or glaucoma and it is not recommended in those who have had a prior C-section. Mechanism of action Prostaglandin E2 binds to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4 to cause various downstream effects to cause direct contractions in the myometrium. In addition, PGE2 inhibits Na+ absorption within the Thick Ascending Limb (TAL) of the Loop of Henle and ADH-mediated water transport in collecting tubules. As a result, blockage of PGE2 synthesis with NSAIDs can limit the efficacy of loop diuretics.  Administration  Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) should only be administered by, or under the direct supervision of, a physician and careful monitoring should be performed. PGE2 comes in many dosage forms with varying pharmacokinetic properties. For example PGE2 can come in a gel formulation that requires six hour dosing or it can come as a slow release dinoprostone pessary that does not need to be re-administered and can be taken out if necessary. In a quality improvement project done in UK, the switch from prostaglandin gel to the slow release dinoprostone pessary was able to lower cesarian section rates in women undergoing induction of labor in maternity care. For the vaginal insert (brand name Cervidil), the manufacturer recommends keeping the medication frozen until use since it does not need to be warmed to room temperature. Once the package is open, a water miscible lubricant may be used to insert the medication, using your finger place the device into the vagina and position the device transversely in the posterior vaginal fornix. The person receiving the drug should remain laying down for two hours after administration of the insert is complete. The manufacturer also recommends waiting 30 minutes after removal of insert before starting oxytocin. The vaginal gel (brand name Prostin E2, Canada) is administered through a prefilled syringe and the medication is placed in the posterior fornix of the vagina. After administration people should stay laying down for at least 30 minutes after they have received the drug.  Contraindications  Contraindications to a medication are any reasons to not use the drug. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is used to induce labor and should not be used in people that are contraindicated to give birth vaginally or spontaneous labor. PGE2 should not be used in people with allergies to prostaglandins or any components in the drugs formulations. PGE2 should be stopped before other oxytocic agents like oxytocin are given. Dinoprostone as a vaginal suppository is contraindicated for women with acute pelvic inflammatory disease or active disease of the cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic, or renal systems. Caution is required for people with a history of cervical malignancy, hypo- or hypertension, anemia, epilepsy, jaundice, asthma, or pulmonary diseases. The suppository formulation is also not indicated for viable fetus evacuation. Endocervical gel is contraindicated in those with who have a history of C-sections or major uterine surgery, if the fetus is in distress and delivery is not imminent, vaginal bleeding throughout the pregnancy that is unexplained, past history of difficult labors and deliveries, have cephalopelvic disproportion, less than six previous term babies with nonvertex presentation, hyper or hypotonic uterine patterns.  Toxicity  When prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is given in excess, hyper-stimulation of the uterus occurs and immediate discontinuation of the drug usually results in resolution of toxic effects. If symptoms continue a beta adrenergic drug (e.g. terbutaline) can be used. There are many different dosage forms of PGE2. The pharmacokinetic properties vary between dosage forms and should not be interchanged. A medication error was cited in the Institute for Safe Medication Practices where Prostin E2 was used in place of Cervidil. The hospital had run out of Cervidil which is a 10 mg endocervical insert and the provider decided to use half of a 20 mg Prostin E2 vaginal suppository. Cervidil delivers the drug at a constant rate and can be removed as necessary while Prostin E2 dissolves immediately and can not be removed. This error resulted in an emergency C-section since the fetus's heart rate dropped suddenly.  Pharmacokinetics  PGE2 has a half-life of approximately 2.5–5 minutes, with most metabolites being excreted in the urine.  History  Swedish physiologist Ulf von Euler and British physiologist M.W. Goldblatt, first discovered prostaglandins independently in 1935 as factors contained in human seminal fluid. Prostaglandins were noted for having blood pressure reducing effects and smooth muscle regulation effects. Prostaglandin E2 itself was identified in 1962 by Swedish biochemist Sune Bergström in the seminal fluid of sheep. The structure of prostaglandins is conserved in mammals, but it is also produced by marine organisms which allowed for more research into their biological roles. Prostaglandins were discovered to be products of arachidonic acid and with the ability to radio label arachidonic acid in the early 1960s, American chemist E.J. Corey was able to synthesize Prostaglandin E2 in the lab in the 1970. This advancement paved the way for later studies that helped define the actions and response of Prostaglandin E2. Prostaglandin E2 was approved for medical use in the United States in 1977 and it is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Prostaglandin E2 was approved by the FDA in 1977.

It aired on CBC on January 7 and 8 of 2007. Synopsis The film focuses on several stories about Asian Canadian organized gangs, set mostly in Vancouver and Richmond, British Columbia, Canada. One of them involves an Asian-Canadian Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officer, Tommy Jiang (played by Mann), who is seeking to bring down two Asian gangsters named Willie the Duck and Movie Star (played by Tsang and Chou, respectively), in the process risking losing everything, including his marriage, as he goes deeper into the criminal organization. Eventually, the final showdown occurs between Movie Star and Jiang. Another story focuses on the Wahs, an immigrant family from China. The parents in that family (played by real life husband and wife Tzi Ma and Christina Ma) are concerned about their son Jason (played by Wong), who is constantly the victim of racial bullying. Jason soon receives help, but from a Chinese-Canadian youth with gang connections. They attempt a robbery but fail, and Jason is forced to flee for his life while his father Henry tries to save him. The third story is about an illegal Cambodian immigrant named Chavy Pahn (Steph Song) who comes to Vancouver to seek a modelling career but is instead trapped in Canada with no friends, no passport and a $30,000 debt. Forced into prostitution at a senior gang member's wife's massage parlour because she cannot pay her debts, she seeks the help of a gang-enforcer (Quon), who befriends her, as means of escape. In the conclusion of all three stories, Jiang investigations and frequent confrontations with Movie Star, end up getting him framed and suspended from the RCMP who receive a false complaint that Jiang was sleeping with a prostitute and abused her. Jiang who spends most of his time trying to catch and arrest Movie Star who ordered a home invasion finally catches a confession from Movie Star, who admits to ordering of a home invasion which belonged to a cleaning lady who worked for Belinda Lok, Belinda who was sent the recording confronts and murders Movie Star. Jason who was on the run from being involved manages to finally reunite with his family, as his parents scare off the triad teens who were attempting to silence him. Sorrows a Triad enforcer, protects Chavy Pahn from Fat-Ass and presumably kills him and removes Fat Ass's testicles as proof to Chavy has nothing to fear anymore but it remains unclear whether Chavy decides to stay in Vancouver or go back to Cambodia. The Lok's and Au's older brother Lincoln Au discuss a deal but its secretly being tape recorded by the RCMP implying that the police will soon close in on the Lok family soon. Jiang finally gets to see his family again but its left ambiguous if his wife will accept him again.

Besides that, a year was spent researching Asian Canadian gangs in the Vancouver area, in cooperation with the RCMP. In addition, the series' writer Ian Weir immersed himself in Asian Canadian and Asian American culture before writing the script. He also worked with some in the Chinese community during the script's writing, checking to see what worked and what didn't. This resulted in some of the tongue-in-cheek references made about Chinese stereotypes by some of the characters, such as Jiang, in the miniseries. Critical response and viewership The critical response for Dragon Boys have been overwhelmingly positive, in large part due to its depth and realism resulting from the performances of the internationally based cast from Hong Kong, Canada and the United States. According to CBC executives, the producers of the miniseries have been given permission to start a sequel to Dragon Boys. The writers have already started writing the script, and the production is hoping to start filming in the fall of 2007. However, the viewership numbers fell short of expectations on the first night, with approximately 383,000 viewers. It did slightly better on the finale the next night, with 391,000 viewers. Controversy and community involvement Before the miniseries aired, there was concern from the Chinese Canadian community about possible backlash from other communities; the villains in the miniseries are predominantly Asian Canadian, leading to possibly racist implications. Some Chinese Canadian film and television personnel even threatened to boycott the miniseries. This led to the producers hiring several prominent Asian Canadians in the community to look over the script to filter out what could be insulting. One of the changes made to accommodate Asian Canadians more was the omission of the character of a Caucasian police chief; it was decided that going with a white boss would be counter-productive to the story, and a senior Asian Canadian officer was added instead to add complexity to the script. Another change that was made took previously submissive and weak Asian female characters in the miniseries and making them outspoken and stronger. More Asian characters were also added to the protagonists' side, so not all the \\"bad guys\\" are Asian. Despite the content of the miniseries, the writer and the director are both Caucasian. Steph Song (who plays Chavy Pahn) found that to be an advantage, in contrast to the alleged racism accusations made by the Chinese Canadian community before it aired. Song claimed that if the miniseries was written and directed by Chinese Canadians, there would be too much sympathy on the part of the Asian characters, and that the \\"truth\\" about the Asian drug dealing industry would not have been exposed in an adequate manner. Filming locations The film was filmed in the Vancouver, Richmond and Langley, British Columbia area, but takes place in Richmond, a city famous for its Golden Village Asian district on No. 3 Road, as well as its large Asian community which makes up 60 percent of the city's population. Some scenes were shot at one of the malls within the Golden Village, Parker Place. Because of the area's high concentration of Asian Canadians, Eric Tsang (a very well known actor in Hong Kong films) was mobbed by fans who recognized him. Partly due to the setting of the miniseries, some of the songs on the series' soundtrack were performed by Asian Canadian musicians from Richmond.

He is also a member of the party's central committee, and a member of the executive of World Agudat Israel. Biography Born in Cluj in Romania in 1939, Halpert is the grandson of Rabbi Mordechai of Nadvirna and Rabbi Yisroel Yaakov of Khust. He studied at the Vyzhnytsia Institute of Talmudic Studies, and was ordained as a rabbi. He made aliyah in 1960. Halpert was first elected to the Knesset in the 1981 elections on the Agudat Israel list. However, he lost his seat in the next elections in 1984. He re-entered the Knesset after the 1988 elections, and was appointed Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister's Office in November 1990. In June 1991, he became Deputy Minister of Labour and Social Welfare. For the 1992 elections, Agudat Israel formed an alliance with Degel HaTorah, which included a seat rotation agreement. Halpert was elected to the Knesset, but served only half a term (until 1994) as part of the arrangement. He retained his seat served full terms after the 1996 and 1999 elections, but lost it in the 2003 elections. However, after United Torah Judaism split towards the end of the Knesset term in 2005, Yisrael Eichler resigned as an MK, and was replaced by Halpert as part of another rotation agreement. Halpert was also appointed Deputy Minister of Transportation. For the 2006 elections, the alliance was reformed, and Halpert was elected to the Knesset on the UTJ list. Like many other religious politicians in Israel, he objected to the 2006 Jerusalem gay pride parade, asking, \\"Have we become like Sodom? Let go of this ugliness. It will oust the divine presence.\\" He has also caused controversy by admitting to hitting his children during a Knesset committee meeting'Corporal punishment is educational' The Jerusalem Post, 19 November 2006 and calling for the separation of the sexes in the Western Wall Plaza.Haredim propose Kotel entry separation The Jerusalem Post, 9 March 2006 He lost his seat in the 2009 elections.

History The party was established in Fort Lamy in 1945.Virginia Thompson & Richard Adloff (1960) The Emerging States of French Equatorial Africa, Stanford University Press, p563 Following the General Council elections, members of the Chadian-French Progressive List (which had won 7 seats), Republican Union (four seats) and Franco-Chadian Progressive Group (unrepresented) formed the new party, which was also joined by two of the three elected independents.Bernard Lanne (1998) Histoire politique du Tchad de 1945 à 1958: administration, partis, élections, KARTHALA Editions, p102 Its founders were mainly by African traditional leaders including Gontchomé Sahoulba, with the party representing French commercial interests and a bloc of traditional leaders composed primarily of Muslim and Ouaddaïan nobility. It was linked with the Rally of the French People (RPF), a Gaullist conservative political party representing the Europeans in Chad, and also sided with the other political parties founded in Chad by European expatriates. Members of the UDT party at first won easily local elections; it won both seats in the June 1946 French National Assembly elections. Although it only won one seat in the November 1946 elections, it won all three seats in the 1951 elections. In the 1952 Territorial Assembly elections the party received 72% of the Second College vote, winning 24 of the 30 seats, whilst the RPF won all 15 First College seats. However, from 1953 it began to be superseded by Chadian Social Action, which had broken away from the UDT. As a result, the UDT started dissolving itself, having also come under threat from the emergence of the Chadian Progressive Party (PPT), which was more radical and nationalistic. In the 1957 Territorial Assembly elections, which saw a victory for the PPT, the UDT had only a marginal role as an ally of the PPT. The party was dissolved in 1960.Chad: Defunct parties EISA References Category:Defunct political parties in Chad Category:1945 establishments in Chad Category:Political parties established in 1945 Category:1960 disestablishments in Chad Category:Political parties disestablished in 1960 ","title":"Chadian Democratic Union"},{"id":"3936708","text":"Pepperell may refer to: People *Albert Pepperell (1922–1986), rugby league footballer *Derek Pepperell (born 1968), English cricketer *East Bay Ray (born Raymond John Pepperell, born 1958), punk guitarist *Eddie Pepperell (born 1991), English golfer *Russell Pepperell (1918–2003), rugby league footballer *Stan Pepperell (1914–1985), rugby league footballer *William Pepperrell (1696–1759), merchant and soldier in Colonial Massachusetts *William Pepperell Montague (1873–1953), philosopher Places *Pepperell (CDP), Massachusetts *Pepperell, Massachusetts, U.S. **Pepperell Center Historic District *Pepperrell Air Force Base, a decommissioned U.S. military base located in St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada *East Pepperell, Massachusetts See also *Pepperrell (disambiguation) ","title":"Pepperell"},{"id":"3936709","text":"The Christy Awards are awarded each year to recognize novels of excellence written from a Christian worldview.

Set mainly in southern France, the film is about a highly intelligent criminal—pursued by international police and the Russian mafia—whose extensive plastic surgery makes him unrecognizable, even to his girlfriend, who enlists the help of an unsuspecting stranger on a train. The film was shot on location in Gare de Lyon in Paris 12, the Hôtel Carlton in Cannes, the Hôtel Negresco in Nice, Ibiza in the Balearic Islands, and on the TGV Paris-Nice train. Anthony Zimmer was released on 27 April 2005 in France, and was critically well received—described as \\"better than average\\" by Variety, \\"a good, strong story with a final twist well told\\" by Urban Cinefile, and \\"an especially well-made Hitchcock-style odyssey\\" by Shadows on the Wall. The film did well at the box-office, with 774,469 seats sold in France, and eventually earned $6,306,533 internationally. For his directorial debut, Jérôme Salle received a nomination for the César Award for Best First Feature Film. Plot Anthony Zimmer is a genius career criminal wanted by police around the world. He has used ingenious methods to launder money legally, using dummy corporations that file lawsuits against firms outside France. Zimmer is also being pursued by the \\"White Collar Barons\\"—a powerful Russian mafia with whom he once did business. Zimmer is an elusive character, however, with no known description of his appearance following his recent plastic surgery. One standout detective named Akerman is getting close to catching the criminal mastermind; he knows that Zimmer will risk everything to reunite with the lover he left behind, Chiara Manzoni, who has not seen him since his plastic surgery. Anticipating a reunion with Zimmer, Chiara arrives at a restaurant, where she receives a message from her boyfriend, telling her to \\"pick up\\" a stranger whose general appearance matches his own in order to mislead his pursuers. Chiara boards a TGV high-speed train and chooses François Taillandier, a bland 38-year-old translator who reads detective novels and whose wife left him over six months ago. Fascinated by this beautiful mysterious woman, François has difficulty concentrating on his yogurt and reading. When they arrive at Cannes, Chiara invites François to stay over with her at the Carlton Hotel. She also gives him a watch that bears Zimmer's name on the back. The next morning, François wakes up alone and finds himself the target of two hitmen. He frantically escapes and seeks shelter at a nearby police station. There, he befriends Lt. Camel Driss, who provides him with clothes and a room at a nearby hospital. They discover that Chiara checked out of the Carlton Hotel that day. Driss believes François' story after seeing a bullet hole in the hotel room, which is now occupied by members of the White Collar Barons and their leader, Nassaiev. Later that night, Driss is murdered. When he sees Nassaiev and his goons outside his room, François escapes and unexpectedly reunites with Chiara, who takes him to a secret hideout in Nice. There, she explains that she set him up because he matches Zimmer's build, and she tells him to stay in the hideout for a few days. The next day, however, François leaves the hideout and stalks her outside the Hotel Negresco, hoping to get more answers from her. Soon François is nabbed by the police and interrogated by Akerman, who reveals to him that Chiara is in fact an undercover DGDDI agent. That night, Akerman secretly meets up with Chiara to discuss the rendezvous Zimmer proposed in a classified ad. Akerman tells her that while she will be at the rendezvous point, he will keep an eye on François. With François in custody, Akerman and his men park their surveillance truck and post their snipers within the vicinity of the rendezvous point: Zimmer's old mansion. Chiara enters the mansion and confronts the White Collar Barons and Nassaiev, who threatens to kill her if Zimmer does not arrive within five minutes. François leaves the truck and rushes into the mansion to save her, but is immediately placed on the ground at gunpoint by Nassaiev's men. After Nassaiev rejects her claims that François is not Zimmer, Chiara gives the signal and the snipers shoot down the Russian mobsters. As the police remove the Russian bodies from the scene, François reveals to Chiara that he is, in fact, Anthony Zimmer. She tells him to flee, but Zimmer refuses, even though he knows Chiara is an agent. He opens a secret safe and takes out a notebook filled with his banking information, and leaves it by the front door for Akerman—his way of giving up his life of crime for the woman he loves. Knowing what he's given up for her, Chiara decides not to reveal his true identity to the police, and the two drive away together.

It was released in DVD format that same year. Reception =Critical response= Anthony Zimmer was critically well received. In her review in Variety magazine, Lisa Nesselson wrote that the \\"well-staged antics are not of the breathless variety, but a handful of original moments and a satisfying twist make the movie better than average.\\" In his review on the DVD Talk website, Svet Atanasov called Anthony Zimmer a \\"modest French production\\" that \\"tiptoes somewhere on the verge between being a sugary melodrama and an action-packed nailbiter with plenty of unexpected twists\\". Atanasov noted that the film \\"manages to pull quite a few intelligent stunts with an admirable finesse\\". Atanasov singled out first-time director Jérôme Salle and veteran actress Sophie Marceau for their work on the film: Andrew L. Urban on the Urban Cinefile website wrote that the performances of Sophie Marceau and Yvan Attal \\"make this thriller fully engaging and the locations are a great bonus. A good, strong story with a final twist is well told, and the tension never lets up. In their review on the Get the Big Picture website, the Three Abiding Dudes also applauded the performances of Marceau and Attal, noting the chemistry between the two actors is a key reason for the film's success. \\"We can actually see the attraction between the two prinicple actors,\\" they write, \\"It's strong enough to carry the film when these two are on the screen, and when they are by themselves we can understand their motives and reasoning.\\" In his review for the Shadows on the Wall website, Rich Cline gave the film four out of five stars, calling it \\"an especially well-made Hitchcock-style odyssey that really keeps us guessing where it's going\\". Cline singles out first-time director Salle who \\"keeps things cracking from start to finish, continually subverting our expectations\\". Cline concludes: =Box office= The film did well at the box- office, with 774,469 seats sold in France. =Accolades= The film received a nomination for the César Award for Best First Feature Film for director Jérôme Salle. Remake The film was remade under the title The Tourist, which was directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, and starred Johnny Depp, Angelina Jolie, Paul Bettany, and Timothy Dalton. Filming began on February 23, 2010 in Paris and was released on December 10, 2010. Despite being a box- office success and receiving three nominations (Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Actress) in the Musical or Comedy picture category at the 68th Golden Globe Awards, the remake was met with mostly negative critical reviews.

History In the second half of the 14th century Livonian Order built the Aizkraukle Castle, a few kilometres downstream from the ancient hillfort of Livs. The ruins of the castle still remain today. Before World War I, the settlement that stood near the site of modern-day Aizkraukle was known by its German name of Ascheraden. The modern town was established in 1961 as a settlement to house the builders of the nearby hydroelectric power plant of Pļaviņas.Pospelov, p. 24 It was originally called StučkaLatvijas PSR Administratīvi Teritoriālais Iedalījums, p. 47 (or \\"\\", StuchkaLatvijas PSR Administratīvi Teritoriālais Iedalījums, p. 118 and \\"\\", imeni Petra Stuchki in Russian), for Pēteris Stučka, a Latvian communist. Town status was granted to it in 1967, which is also when it became the administrative center of Stučkas District. In 1990, it was renamed Aizkraukle, after the nearest railway station.

The characters served as supporting cast members in Thor. The Warriors Three are the Asgardians Fandral, Hogun, and Volstagg. Though the characters are gods of Asgard, they are original creations of Marvel Comics and not based on characters from Norse mythology. The Warriors Three have appeared in various media adaptations of Thor, including the 2011 Marvel Cinematic Universe film Thor, its 2013 sequel Thor: The Dark World, and the 2017 sequel Thor: Ragnarok. Publication history Fandral, Hogun, and Volstagg first appeared in Journey into Mystery #119 (Aug 1965) and were created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. They are first referred to as the \\"Warriors Three\\" not in a story, but in the letters page of Thor #244 (February 1976). The Warriors Three were the stars in issue #30 of the tryout series Marvel Spotlight. Though it did not result in the characters getting their own series, the comedy-oriented issue became a fan favorite and has been cited by writer Len Wein as one of his favorite stories: \\"It was just such a joy to write, and the late, great John Buscema's artwork didn't exactly hurt it no-how.\\" In late 2010 (with cover dates January–April 2011), the Warriors Three finally got their own four-issue mini-series, written by Bill Willingham and illustrated by Neil Edwards. Fictional biography The Warriors Three have played a supporting role in Marvel's Thor title since the late 1960s. For some time, Volstagg was the coward of the group, succeeding more with luck than skill. He gained courage over time and is now more than ever, likely to be found on the front lines of battle. They first appeared when going on a quest with Thor and other Asgardians to prevent Ragnarok. The trio have multiple adventures with their friend Thor, such as when they battled the Thermal Man.Thor #170 (November 1969). Marvel Comics. For a time, they quest with him in outer space; one of their adventures involved saving an alien world from a naive tentacled beast.Thor #256 (February 1977). Marvel Comics. In the limited series Thor: Blood Oath (published in 2005, but chronologically set much earlier), Thor and the Warriors Three are sent on a quest as penance for accidentally killing an enemy giant during a time of peace. Although they fail in their quest, through the use of each warrior's unique capabilities, the adventure eventually comes to a good end. The group is allied with the earth-bound group the New Mutants. During the mutants' first trip to Asgard, they drank and celebrated with Roberto da Costa (Sunspot). During the group's second visit, the Three encounter new members of the group and do not find their story of Hela's plan to kill to Odin believable. Volstagg's children do and free the group, helping them on their way. Boom Boom, Warlock and the New Mutant ally, the wolf-prince Hrimhari, rescue the Three from the fatal attentions of Queen Ula and her hive. Hrimhari's honor is enough to convince the Three and Queen Ula to join in on the attempt to defeat Hela. Other Asgardians join in on the fight and soon, Odin is saved.New Mutants #83–87 (1989–90). Marvel Comics. When Bragi, the god of poetry, had become lost in the wilds of Asgard, just a little bit before he was due to entertain at All- Father Odin's Mid-Summer celebration, the Warriors Three braved multiple problems in order to rescue the poet and bring him home.Marvel Fanfare #13. Marvel Comics. Another Fanfare issue focused on the wife of Ulik the Rock Troll. Despite the many attacks by Ulik against Asgardians, his wife feels she has nowhere else to go when she thinks her husband is in trouble. Hogun wants nothing to do with her, but Volstagg convinces him to at least consult with Fandral. The conclusion of the story has Ulik yet again attacking. =Ragnarok= When Thor's misunderstood brother Loki brought Ragnarök down upon Asgard, two of the warriors (Fandral and Hogun) were killed off-panel by an arrow storm launched from the deck of the flying ship Naglfar. Volstagg survived and was discovered by Thor hiding inside a statue, only now being emaciated and frail. Nevertheless, he would fight on with the army Thor had raised, which included Sif and Beta Ray BillThor vol. 2 #82. Marvel Comics.

He refused to become involved in the Intelligence-led 'Clockwork Orange' project, alleged to have been an attempt to smear various individuals including a number of senior British politicians in the early 1970s. He also attempted to draw public attention to the Kincora Boys' Home sexual abuse scandal several years before the Royal Ulster Constabulary finally intervened. He was wrongly convicted of manslaughter in 1981, for which he spent six years in prison, until 1987. The conviction was later quashed in the light of new forensic and other evidence that raised serious questions about the dubious nature of the evidence used to convict Wallace initially. The journalist Paul Foot, in his book Who Framed Colin Wallace?, suggested that Wallace may have been framed for the killing, possibly to discredit the allegations he was making. This view was similarly expressed by Alex Carlile QC (now Lord Carlile), who later speculated that this may have been the motive not just for the alleged frameup, but also for murder. Early life Wallace was born in Randalstown, Northern Ireland, in 1943 and educated at Ballymena Academy. He was initially commissioned into the Territorial Army in 1961, and later became a marksman in the paramilitary Ulster Special Constabulary, or 'B Specials'. A former cadet officer in the Irish Guards, he was commissioned in 1972 into the Ulster Defence Regiment, part of the Regular Army, and was immediately granted the rank of captain. He became the Regiment's Psychological Operations officer. He was seconded to the New Zealand SAS before working for British Intelligence as a psychological warfare officer. During the early 1970s he ran the British Army's free-fall parachute display team in Northern Ireland, taking part in a variety of 'Hearts and Minds' projects throughout the Province. Several members of that team were also members of the Special Air Service (SAS) or the Intelligence Corps. In 1969, The Irish Guards Association Journal carried this reference to Wallace: \\"He is a great training enthusiast and is never happier than when he is on top of one 3,000-foot peak busily engaged in plotting his hop to the next one. He will eventually achieve great fame as he will, no doubt, be the first Brigade officer to visit RHQ without getting salute at the main gate - as knowing him, he will surely parachute in.\\"Irish Guards Association Journal, February 1969, page 35 Information officer Wallace joined the Ministry of Defence on 15 March 1968 as an assistant information officer for the British Army at its Northern Ireland headquarters at Thiepval Barracks in Lisburn. He became an established information officer from 14 December 1971, and a senior information officer with effect from 27 September 1974, having first held this latter post on temporary promotion from 1972.Commons statement on Wallace As well as carrying out overt information work for the British Army, Wallace was also working for 14 Intelligence Company as a member of the ultra-secret Army Psychological Operations unit (Information Policy), covertly attempting to undermine, disrupt and control paramilitary groups. In the years following his appointment to the Information Policy unit, Wallace received high praise from the senior staff at Thiepval. In 1971, his Annual Confidential Report concluded: 'This is an officer of the highest calibre. Totally dedicated to the Army, he demonstrates this by a devotion to duty that is truly remarkable.' The counter-signing officer scribbled underneath: 'I heartily agree.' In 1972, the Chief of Staff recorded that enthusiasm and dedication were not his only virtues. His abilities were just as remarkable: 'Continues to demonstrate that his talents are of the very highest standard.'Extracts from Wallace's Annual Confidential Reports released by the MOD in 1975 Wallace's former boss, Major Tony Staughton, confirmed that by 1973 he had twice recommended Wallace for the MBE, and could not understand how and why the recommendations were turned down. \\"I've never known such a deserving case,\\" he told journalist Paul Foot. In February 1975, Ian Cameron, senior MI5 officer attached to Army HQ Northern Ireland, wrote a report on Wallace’s role in Northern Ireland: =Clockwork Orange= In 1973 and 1974, Wallace was involved with an operation called Clockwork Orange. Wallace alleges that this involved right-wing members of the security services in a disinformation campaign aimed not at paramilitary organisations in Northern Ireland, but at British MPs. He was supported by a covert specialist military troop (possibly an SAS unit made up of specially-trained Northern Ireland personnel). This group was shrouded in secrecy. Journalists from foreign news organisations would be given briefings and shown forged documents, which purported to show that politicians were speaking at Irish republican rallies or were receiving secret deposits in Swiss bank accounts. On 16 March 1976 the British Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, retired suddenly without any apparent reason. In the days leading up to his resignation there had been no hint that he was about to go. Two months later, on 12 May, Wilson invited two BBC reporters, Barrie Penrose and Roger Courtiour to visit him at his home at 5 North Street, near Parliament. He told the reporters that he believed members of MI5 had been involved in a plot to undermine his Government. He said that he had called in the head of MI6, Sir Maurice Oldfield, who told him that there was a section of MI5 that \\"was unreliable\\" and that he (Oldfield) was \\"going to bring it out\\". Wilson also said that he had called in the head of MI5, Sir Michael Hanley, who confirmed the existence within his Service of a disaffected faction with extreme right-wing views. Later, the two reporters interviewed Sir Michael Hanley at his home and asked him if there had been talk of a coup to overthrow the Wilson Government in the mid 1970s. The former Head of MI5 replied: \\"I think it is generally accepted. Yes\\". On 19 May 1976, The Daily Telegraph published a story under the headline: \\"Campaign in US to smear MPs\\". The story claimed that \\"persistent efforts have been made in recent months to discredit leading members of the three major British political parties by planting derogatory stories about them in news agencies in Washington\\". One of the news agencies to be given such information said: \\"So far this year we have been offered similar matter about some eleven MPs, a Conservative, two Liberals and eight Labour\\". The Pencourt File by Barrie Penrose and Roger Courtiour, Secker and Warburg1978 In his book, Spycatcher, former senior MI5 officer, Peter Wright stated: The information appears to bear a striking similarity to some of the material contained in the notes which Colin Wallace had been instructed two years earlier as part of the 'Clockwork Orange' project. People named in Colin Wallace's notes as having been targeted in this manner included Harold Wilson, Edward Heath, Merlyn Rees, Cyril Smith, Jeremy Thorpe, Tony Benn and Ian Paisley. On 20 March 1975, Hugh Mooney, a member of the top secret Information Research Department run by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, wrote a memo to his superiors claiming that the former Head of Army Intelligence in Northern Ireland told him that Colin Wallace \\"had been one of his best sources.\\" MI5 accused Colin Wallace of leaking information to the press about William McGrath, the leader of the Loyalist paramilitary group Tara, who had been sexually abusing children at the Kincora Home.https://villagemagazine.ie/index.php/2018/05/licence-to- deceive/ However, official records later showed that he had been instructed by his superiors to draw the attention of the press to McGrath's activities. Mooney also gave an interview to the Sunday Correspondent on 18 March 1990 about Colin Wallace's attempts to expose the sexual abuse at Kincora,. The Sunday Correspondent report said: On 21 February 2019, Colin Wallace wrote to the then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley MP, and provided her with documentary evidence that three of the official Inquiries into the abuses at Kincora had deliberately misled Parliament. He also queried why the investigations had failed to interview key, identified witnesses from the Intelligence Services. His comments and questions remain unanswered. After HQNI Wallace resigned from the Ministry of Defence in 1975 in order to avoid disciplinary action, ostensibly for privately briefing journalists with classified information. Wallace always claimed that this action was consistent with his secret job duties as a member of the Intelligence Services and that the real reasons for his dismissal were related to his refusal to continue working on the Clockwork Orange project in October 1974, and his exposure of a child abuse scandal at the Kincora Boys' Home. He claimed his allegations were blocked because the leading perpetrator was both a leading member of a loyalist paramilitary group and an undercover agent for MI5. The government later admitted that Wallace had the authority to take decisions on the release of classified information in support of psychological operations.https://villagemagazine.ie/index.php/2019/10/her-majestys- hatchetman-the-murder-of-pat-finucane/ In the 1980s, to support his claims, Wallace produced a collection of documents, including a series of handwritten notes on material which formed part of the Clockwork Orange project. The notes were later subjected to an independent forensic analysis by Dr Julius Grant, and the results were consistent with the notes having been made contemporaneously during the 1970s.Foot, Paul (1989) - details below in Bibliography Wallace was probably the first member of the security forces to attempt to draw public attention to the sexual abuse of children at the Kincora Boys' Home in Belfast. In 1973, at the request of his superior officers, he gave several journalists the name of the loyalist paramilitary leader running the home, together with his address and telephone number. He also pointed out that the man was \\"a known homosexual.\\" None of the newspapers he briefed published the story and the abuse of children continued unabated for a further seven years before the police were finally forced to take action following revelations in the Irish Independent. Several commentators have pointed to the coincidence that the events which led to Wallace being wrongly convicted of manslaughter took place shortly after Kincora was finally exposed in the Irish Independent. Writing in the New Statesman in 1986, Duncan Campbell revealed that, at about the time Wallace was charged with manslaughter, intelligence officers wrote to Sir Frank Cooper, Permanent Under Secretary of State at the Ministry of Defence, warning him that \\"Wallace had both the information and the motivation to reveal the story behind Kincora\\".http://www.duncancampbell.org/menu/journalism/newstatesman/newstatesman-1986/gov%20must%20answer%20kincora%20questions.pdf Entries in intelligence notebooks kept during 1974 by former Special Military Intelligence Unit Officer, Captain Fred Holroyd, who had met Colin Wallace in Northern Ireland at that time,New Statesman, 4 May 1984 refer to the Kincora hostel by name, and say of leading Protestant politicians that they are \\"all queers\\", as British Army and RUC intelligence officials had had no difficulty coupling information about homosexual Protestant extremist politicians to the Kincora hostel. Holroyd is also quoted as saying that, while being trained for his Northern Ireland duties, he was told that the Tara organisation was in effect controlled by British intelligence, and was not a real security threat, implying that William McGrath, a former house-father at Kincora and leader of Tara, had come under intelligence control before 1973. Clive Ponting, a former senior official in the Ministry of Defence, told the Sunday Times that he had attended meetings with MI5 officers at the MOD to discuss how to prevent Wallace and Fred Holroyd from making allegations about 'dirty tricks' in Northern Ireland. Ponting said that MI5 were \\"genuinely worried about what Wallace might say\\".\\"Irish firm in bid to publish Wright book\\". Sunday Times 17 May 1987. In March 1987, a former MI5 agent, James Miller, told the Sunday Times that he knew Wallace when he was working in Northern Ireland during the 1970s. Miller said that his first task for MI5 was to spy on William McGrath. He said that his MI5 handler told him to leave McGrath to them (MI5) and he understood that \\"they used his information to recruit McGrath as an informer.\\"Sunday Times 29 March 1987 After the Kincora story was initially exposed in the press, the Northern Ireland Secretary, James Prior, asked Sir George Terry, the Chief Constable of the Sussex Police, to carry out an investigation into the affair. Terry's full report was never shown to Parliament. In a summary of the report, Terry said: \\"Military sources have been frank, and I am satisfied there is no substance to allegations that Army intelligence had knowledge of homosexual abuse at Kincora.\\" This inexplicable conclusion almost certainly misled the British Parliament. Moreover, Terry failed to inform Parliament that MI5 had refused to allow one of their senior officers, who had blocked prior military investigations into Kincora, to be questioned by his investigators.'The Kincora Scandal' by Chris Moore It was, therefore, no surprise that Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly ridiculed the report. John Cushnahan, a spokesman for the non-sectarian Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, was indignant: he found one of the most disturbing aspects of Terry's conclusions was the complete dismissal of any possibility that military circles knew about the scandal. He then referred to a number of people as having been interviewed by British Army people for British military intelligence about William McGrath and Kincora. Cushnahan concluded by saying that it was misleading and blatantly dishonest for Terry to claim that the whole matter had been fully ventilated.The Irish Times, 10 November 1983 Despite the obvious and unexplained weaknesses of the Terry Inquiry, Prior told Parliament that a 1921 Act Inquiry was not justified. Instead, Prior proposed to establish a public inquiry under the powers contained in article 54 of the Health and Personal Social Services (Northern Ireland) Order 1972 to examine the administration of Kincora and of young people's hostels in Northern Ireland. That Inquiry would be led by a retired circuit judge, Judge William HughesHansard.House of Commons Debate 18 January 1984 vol 52 cc319-26 and it was decided that \\"It will be up to the Inquiry and the eminent judge who will preside over it to examine anything which is relevant to the particular boy's home (Kincora), or to the other five boys' homes, and the circumstances which led up to the problems.\\"Hansard House of Commons Debate 18 January 1984 vol 52 cc319-26 When asked on The World At One (BBC Radio 4, 18 January 1984) if the inquiry would take evidence on the alleged activities of the intelligence agencies, Prior replied that if there was any evidence, it would.'The World at One', BBC Radio 4, 18 January 1984 Despite these assurances given by Prior, Judge Hughes made it clear in his report: \\"The conduct of the police, or elected representatives, or clergymen, or military intelligence or any other persons who may have been in receipt of allegations, information or rumours relating to Kincora or any other home, was not under scrutiny in this Inquiry.\\"Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Children s Homes and Hostels the Hughes Inquiry 31 12 1985 Colin Wallace's evidence was, therefore, excluded from the Hughes Inquiry. In July 2014, Exaro News reported that the late Lord Havers, as Attorney General in 1984, limited the terms of reference for the Inquiry to exclude politicians and other key categories of people from investigation.http://www.exaronews.com/articles/5328/baroness- butler-sloss-faces-another-hitch-in-heading-csa-inquiry In 1974, Wallace's Army Annual Confidential Report described his performance in Northern Ireland as \\"outstanding\\" and said that he had made \\"one of the most effective personal contributions of any to the standing and reputation of the Army in these troubles.\\" The Report was signed by the Commander Land Forces, Northern Ireland, Major General Peter Leng.Documents released by the MOD at Wallace's disciplinary hearing in 1975 Later that year, Wallace was promoted to Senior Information Officer and, shortly afterwards, he wrote a lengthy memorandum to his superiors complaining that no action was being taken to stop the sexual abuse of children at the Kincora Home. A few weeks later he was removed from his job on the grounds that his life \\"was in danger\\", and posted to an Army HQ in England. Former BBC journalist, Martin Dillon, who has written several best-selling books on the Northern Ireland conflict, says: > One of the ghastly aspects of what became known as 'The Kincora Scandal' was > that McGrath and McKeague (another Loyalist paramilitary paedophile), as > Intelligence assets, were agents of the State.

Why have elected representatives, including MPs from > Northern Ireland itself, been so reluctant to become involved in uncovering > the truth?'The Kincora Scandal In 1980, David McKittrick of the Irish Times, reported how he had been briefed by Wallace \\"many times\\" during the 1970s: > It was clear that he had access to the highest levels of intelligence data. > He had a encyclopaedic memory, which he occasionally refreshed with calls > made on his personal scrambler telephone to the headquarters intelligence > section a few floors above his office.Irish Times 21 March 1981 Peter Broderick, Head of the Army Information Services at HQ Northern Ireland in 1973, said: > To my knowledge, he (Wallace) worked at least 80 hours a week: coming to his > desk every day.

In order to do his job, he had constant and free access to > information of the highest classification and extreme sensitivity. =Imprisonment= In 1980, shortly after the Kincora story appeared in the press, Wallace was arrested and subsequently convicted of the manslaughter of the husband of one of his colleagues. It was reported that Wallace had beaten antiques dealer Jonathan Lewis to death before attending a dinner party with the dead man's wife. Later that night, Wallace was alleged to have dumped the body in the River Arun.The Guardian; Man gaoled for killing, 21 March 1981 He served six years in gaol, from 1981 to 1987. The conviction was quashed in 1996 in the light of new forensic and other evidence. During the appeal hearing, a Home Office pathologist, Dr Ian West, admitted that some of the evidence that he had used at Wallace's trial had been supplied to him by \\"an American security source\\". The journalist Paul Foot, in his book Who Framed Colin Wallace?, suggested that Wallace may have been framed for the killing, possibly by renegade members of the security services in a bid to discredit his allegations about the Kincora scandal, and the fact that members of the intelligence community had attempted to rig the 1974 general election after which Harold Wilson came to power with a minority government. Wallace himself suggested that Lewis had been murdered by 'rivals in the antiques trade' and that the police had suppressed evidence to that effect.Steve Boggan, 'Wallace faces possibility of new death trial', The Independent, 9 October 1996 In June 1998, a former Special Branch officer who was familiar with the Wallace case wrote to Paul Foot saying: > I sincerely believe that Colin Wallace was 'fitted up' by corrupt members of > the Establishment embarrassed by the events described in the early part of > your book. I do not suggest for a moment that any Sussex Police officer > involved in this enquiry was corrupt, because I do not believe they were, > but I feel there was a hidden agenda, and that the senior officers knew a > lot more about the matter than they would ever care to reveal.Paul Foot > private collection 4 June 1998 As the controversy over the Kincora affair gathered momentum, Alex Carlile QC (now Lord Carlile), the SDP–Liberal Alliance's Legal Affairs spokesman, issued a statement saying: \\"It is clear that Colin Wallace, a principled man, knew too much about the Kincora Boys' Home scandal.\\"Alliance Party News Release, 2 March 1987 Two months later, Mr Carlile was quoted in the Sunday Today newspaper saying: > I believe there are many people in high places and within the security > services who feel ill-will towards Wallace for exposing their activities. > The question is that if MI5 was prepared to kill to get even with Wallace, > why not kill him?

I have tried repeatedly in the > House to get an adjournment on the conviction and will continue to do so. In 1987, a former senior Ministry of Defence official, Clive Ponting, was quoted on Channel 4 News about high-level meetings he had taken part in with MI5 officers regarding Wallace's case. > There was never any suspicion that Wallace was making these stories up or > that it was totally unfounded and very easy to rubbish. It was very much a > matter that, OK the story was being contained at the moment because he was > in jail, but that in a few years' time he would be back out again and could > be expected to start making the allegations again and then that would be a > serious problem.Channel 4 News, 25 June 1987 =After Dark= In 1987 Wallace appeared on the first programme of the Channel 4 discussion series After Dark alongside Clive Ponting, T. E. Utley, Peter Hain and others. =Government re-examination= On 12 December 1989, the then Defence Secretary, Tom King, wrote a memo, classified 'Secret', to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher regarding an internal MoD investigation which examined the nature of Colin Wallace’s clandestine role in Psychological Operations in Northern Ireland. MOD memo MO 19/3/19L dated 12 December 1989 That investigation, initiated by Sir Michael Quinlan, the then PUS at the Ministry of Defence, found that Government Ministers had misled Parliament on a number of occasions when answering questions about Colin Wallace and his role in what is referred to as ‘the dirty war’. Remarkably, instead of publishing the findings of the MoD’s own investigation, Tom King suggested to Mrs Thatcher that the Government should create another, much more limited and less damaging, inquiry to explain away why Parliament had been seriously misled for a period of years. In his memo, Tom King said: > Mr David Calcutt QC, the Master of Magdalene College Cambridge, has carried > out a previous sensitive inquiry most satisfactorily and, if you agree, I > would approach him to see if he would be willing to undertake this > investigation. I am confident that we could rely on him to approach these > very sensitive issues with complete discretion. It would be important to > restrict his terms of reference to that handling of Mr Wallace’s CSAB > appeal, so that he could avoid getting drawn into Kincora, ‘Clockwork > Orange’, assassinations etc. I envisage that his recommendations and my > subsequent decision should be published; but that Mr Calcutt should not make > a published report. The Defence Secretary’s suggestion can only be described as both astonishing and deeply worrying. Either the Government genuinely wanted to investigate Colin Wallace’s allegations thoroughly, or they did not. In the absence of information to the contrary, it would appear that David Calcutt was being deliberately used as a totally innocent ‘fall guy’ to get the Government off a very sharp hook. It is not unreasonable to assume, therefore, that had Tom King’s memo to Mrs Thatcher been shown to MPs at that time, there would have been a justifiable outcry in the House. Why, for example, should the Defence Secretary and the Prime Minister want to prevent David Calcutt from investigating Colin Wallace’s allegations regarding the sexual abuses of children at Kincora, or the alleged attempts by members of the Intelligence Services to discredit Harold Wilson and other politicians during the 1974 General Elections? What David Calcutt was being asked to do was purely a ‘smoke and mirrors’ exercise to avoid the whole truth from emerging. It was no surprise that when Tom King announced the setting up of the Inquiry by David Calcutt, he was strongly challenged by MPs on all sides of the House, including both Nationalist and Unionist politicians from Northern Ireland. For example, Jim Marshall (Member for Leicester, South) challenged Tom King saying: > The argument that we are seeking to put to the Secretary of State and to get > him to accept is that, if there is evidence that Mr. Wallace has been > telling the truth in this particular, there may well be validity in his > general arguments and points. Therefore, for that reason if no other, there > is a need for a far wider-scale inquiry than is being proposed at present. > The Secretary of State must know that the piddling little inquiry that he > has set up is to determine whether Mr. Wallace was fairly or unfairly > dismissed in the light of the new evidence - but that just will not do.House > of Commons Hansard 1 February 1990 In the end, the Government got its way and no meaningful investigation took place, and so the cover-up continued and the sovereignty of Parliament was undermined yet again. In a letter to Terence Higgins MP on 30 January 1990, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher referred to earlier statements made by Government Ministers about the Wallace case and said: > I regret to say that a re-examination of departmental papers has brought to > light information which shows that there were a number of statements in my > letters, and in other Ministerial statements and official correspondence, > which were incorrect or require clarification.letter from Margaret Thatcher > to Terence Higgins MP dated 30 January 1990 Later that same day, in the House of Commons, the Government did make a very limited admission that Ministers had \\"inadvertently misled\\" Parliament over Wallace's role and confirmed that he had been involved in disinformation activities on behalf of the security forces and that he had been authorised to supply, on occasions, classified information to journalists. As Tom King had suggested to Mrs Thatcher in his memo dated 12 December 1989, that account fell far short of any admission regarding the abuses of children at Kincora, 'Clockwork Orange', or other really contentious issues such as attempts to discredit leading politicians during the 1974 General Elections. The Armed Forces Minister, Mr Archie Hamilton grudgingly admitted that several key allegations consistently made by Colin Wallace were in fact true. > Papers which have now come to light indicate that, when the case was made to > establish Mr. Wallace's post, it was proposed that its duties should include > responsibilities for providing unattributable covert briefings to the press > ; and it was stated that the incumbent would be required to make on-the-spot > decisions on matters of national security during such interviews. It seems > that, in the event, the arguments for including these responsibilities in Mr > Wallace's job description were made orally rather than in writing to those > who approved the establishment of the SIO post. But presumably Mr. Wallace > was told what duties he was expected to carry out; and indeed it would > appear that he had already been undertaking unattributable briefing > activities of this kind, which may have included disinformation.House of > Commons Hansard Debates for 30 Jan 1990 The inquiry undertaken by Sir David Calcutt QC confirmed that Colin Wallace had, indeed, been working for the intelligence services during the 1970s and that his enforced resignation from the Ministry of Defence had been made on the basis of a false job description designed to conceal his covert role in psychological warfare. Sir David Calcutt also found that members of the Security Service (MI5) had manipulated the disciplinary proceedings taken against Wallace. In the light of the Inquiry's findings, Wallace was awarded compensation by the Government. Although Tom King had informed Mrs Thatcher that part of Colin Wallace's role not only involved the dissemination of Intelligence, but also the gathering Intelligence, and was described by the former heard of Army Intelligence in Northern Ireland as one of his \\"best sources\\", there was no mention of that critically important fact in Archie Hamilton's statement to Parliament. Wallace's solicitor, Jim Nicol, referred Sir David Calcutt's report to the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, on the basis that the conclusions indicated that Security Service officers who manipulated the proceedings had attempted to defraud Wallace. The Metropolitan Police referred the matter to the DPP for guidance. The DPP concluded that it would not be in the public interest for the police to pursue the matter. Despite the findings of the Calcutt Inquiry, the Ministry of Defence refused to allow the Defence Select Committee to have access to Wallace's secret job description. In a letter dated 11 February 1991, the Ministry of Defence said that Wallace's job description contained \\"sensitive information relating to the security and intelligence matters\\" and that the provision of such papers, even under the conditions relating to the Committee's access to classified information, \\"would be inconsistent with the conventions\\"MOD letter D/S of S/PS/20/229J dated 11 February 1991 =Dublin bombings inquiry= Evidence from Wallace was used by the Barron Report, an Irish government inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. A letter from Colin Wallace to Tony Staughton, the Chief Information Officer of the Army Information Service at Lisburn, on 14 August 1975 noted the connections between Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) paramilitaries and intelligence agencies of the British Army and of the RUC Special Branch: > There is good evidence the Dublin bombings [see Dublin and Monaghan > bombings] in May last year were a reprisal for the Irish government's role > in bringing about the [power sharing] Executive.

In short, it would appear that loyalist > paramilitaries and Int/SB members have formed some sort of pseudo-gangs in > an attempt to fight a war of attrition by getting paramilitaries on both > sides to kill each other and, at the same time, prevent any future political > initiative such as Sunningdale.Death Squad Dossier, Irish Mail on Sunday by > Michael Browne, 10 December 2006, see also, Irish Daily Mail, 30 November > 2006 for further information In a further letter dated 30 September 1975, Colin Wallace revealed that MI5 was trying to create a split in the UVF in order to foment violence: > because they wanted the more politically minded ones ousted. I believe much > of the violence generated during the latter part of last year was caused by > some of the new Int people deliberately stirring up the conflict. As you > know, we have never been allowed to target the breakaway UVF, nor the UFF, > during the past year. Yet they have killed more people than the IRA!Report > of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan > Bombings In December 2003, the Dáil's Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, published the Report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings which took place in May 1974. The Inquiry was led by a former Irish Supreme Court Judge, Mr Justice Henry Barron. Judge Barron interviewed Wallace on a number of occasions during the Inquiry and comments: Judge Barron also refers to what he calls \\"the dubious nature of his (Wallace's) conviction for manslaughter in 1981\\", and points out that the \\"conviction was quashed on 21 July 1996.\\" In his book, Inside Intelligence, former SIS officer Anthony Cavendish confirms that he knew Wallace and says that his story is \\"frightening and disquieting, but one which ties in with many events to which I have been privy\\". Cavendish sent Wallace a first edition of his book which contains the following inscription: \\"Colin - a great help and a true friend.\\" Cavendish, a close friend over many years of Sir Maurice Oldfield, former Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service, says that Wallace's assertion that Oldfield was the target of a black propaganda campaign by MI5, \\"match closely details which were told to me privately by Maurice.\\" In his biography of Sir Maurice Oldfield. Richard Deacon [Donald McCormick] writes: > Who were Oldfield's enemies? Who wanted to hound him even in retirement and, > if possible, to destroy him totally?

The intelligence world in which Wallace operated in Northern Ireland was graphically described by Lord Stevens, former Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. Lord Stevens had presided over the Stevens Inquiries into collusion between the intelligence services, the British Army, the RUC and loyalist paramilitaries in the murders of Irish nationalists. In May 2011, he gave evidence to the Joint Committee on the Draft Detention of Terrorist Suspects (Temporary Extension) Bills and said: > When you talk about Intelligence, of the 210 people we arrested, only three > were not (Intelligence) agents. Some of them were agents for all four of > those particular organisations (Army, MI5, MI6 and Special Branch), fighting > against each other, doing things and making a large sum of money, which was > all against the public interest and creating mayhem in Northern Ireland. Any > system that is created in relation to this country and Northern Ireland has > to have a proper controlling mechanism. It has to have a mechanism where > someone is accountable for what the actions are and that has to be > transparent.Minutes of The Joint Committee on the Draft Detention of > Terrorist Suspects (Temporary Extension) Bills, 3 May 2011 Summary To this day, Wallace's full role on behalf of the Army remains a mystery. Former members of the Special Forces admit that Wallace worked with them as far afield as Berlin and the Oman during the Cold War, but the Ministry of Defence and the Intelligence Services still try to distance themselves from what Wallace was doing in Northern Ireland. He had been part of the Army team preparing for the Widgery Tribunal into the Bloody Sunday killings of protesters in Derry, and in 2002 he testified at the Saville Inquiry into the events. One of Wallace's close friends in the Army described him as follows: \\"I played golf with the General. That was an accident. Colin was needed by the General. Everyone needed him. They just could not do without him.\\"\\"Who Framed Colin Wallace\\" by Paul Foot Page 14 Lieutenant-Colonel Tony Yarnold, who worked with Wallace in Northern Ireland, said: \\"Let's face it, Colin was the lynchpin of the whole operation. He was terrific - way ahead of us all in his knowledge and his readiness to work. Everyone wanted him all the time, and somehow he was always available.\\"\\"Who Framed Colin Wallace\\" by Paul Foot Page 13 A former Ministry of Defence Chief Information Officer commented: \\"For loyalty and dedication to the Army, Colin Wallace was in a class of his own. I just cannot conceive of any situation in which he would act maliciously against the interests of the Crown or the Army.\\" Formal statement made by Peter Broderick, Chief Information Officer, Ministry of Defence, in support of Colin Wallace at the disciplinary hearing on 17 October 1975 References External links *Archie Hamilton's answers on Wallace, Hansard 30 January 1990 *Article by Wallace in Lobster magazine, December 2019, accessed 18 August 2020.

The character is a small chimpanzee that's sent into space in a test rocket and exposed to cosmic radiation, which makes him grow to gigantic size and gives him the ability to shoot Kryptonite energy from his eyes. As a \\"Super-Ape\\", Titano rampaged through Metropolis several times in Superman and Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen during the 1960s and 70s, and also appeared in some \\"Tales of the Bizarro World\\" stories in Adventure Comics. After a poorly-received 1978 return fight, Titano was dropped from the canvas. The character also appeared in the post-Crisis on Infinite Earths and New 52 continuities, with different origin stories. Publication history Titano first appeared in Superman #127 (February 1959) in a story called \\"Titano the Super-Ape!\\" He was created by writer Otto Binder, penciler Wayne Boring and inker Stan Kaye. The character was inspired by the 1933 movie King Kong, one of the many famous science-fiction and horror films swiped by Superman editor Mort Weisinger during this period. The character was well received, so Weisinger decided to bring him back for a second story in July 1960. In the first story, Boring drew the character with a chimpanzee head on a giant gorilla body; for the rematch, Boring drew a gorilla head instead, making the character look more like King Kong. Titano made another brief appearance in a January 1961 Superman story (\\"Superman Meets Al Capone!\\", issue #142), where he served as an introductory plot device to get Superman lost in time. By August 1961, Titano became a novelty character, appearing in a Superman backup feature starring Krypto the Superdog (\\"Krypto Battles Titano\\", issue #147), and this trend continued over the next few years, as Titano appeared in occasional \\"Tales of the Bizarro World\\" backup stories in Adventure Comics, and made lightweight appearances in a few Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen stories between 1962 and 1965. After a cameo in a Superman story in 1970, Titano disappeared from the canvas for a while. In 1978, Martin Pasko brought Titano back for a two-part story with the Atomic Skull in Superman #323 and 324 — a story that Pasko looked back on with regret. \\"I thought — foolishly, in retrospect — that I might be able to treat a giant ape that shot kryptonite energy from its eyes with the same straight face I brought to Bizarro,\\" he said in a 2007 interview. \\"I couldn't, and matters were not helped by the art. We kept forgetting that what you got when you called upon the hyper-realistic and earthbound Curt Swan to draw menacing giant monsters invariably looked cute and cuddly at best, and at worst, like something that reminded you of an old Toho movie and made you look for the zipper. I seem to recall that the mail suggested that Titano was one Weisingerism that was best relegated to obscurity.\\" Fictional character biography =Pre-Crisis= Originally named Toto, he was a common chimpanzee who was dubbed \\"one of the world's most intelligent apes\\". Rocketed into space, he and his ship are bombarded with radiation, which change him into a giant ape with incredible strength and the ability to emit beams of Kryptonite radiation from his eyes. Superman stops his first rampage through Metropolis by throwing him across the time barrier into the prehistoric past. A year later, Superman accidentally transports Titano back to modern Metropolis, and has to trick him in order to return him to the past. Over the next few years, Titano is visited in the past by several characters, including Superman, Krypto the Superdog, Bizarro and Jimmy Olsen. After another trip through time to the present day, Titano is picked up by Allura, the ruler of a world of giants, who agrees to transport the ape to her planet. Titano settles down with a female ape his own size. Writer Martin Pasko revived Titano in Superman #324 (June 1978). In this revival, Titano is manipulated by the Atomic Skull into becoming a ferocious killer, rather than the misunderstood super-ape of his original appearance. The Pre-Crisis Titano appears in a dream of the character Ambush Bug. =Post- Crisis= The post-Crisis version first appeared in the \\"Tears for Titano\\" story in Superman Annual #1. Titano was originally a normal baby chimpanzee used in cruel scientific experiments for the US government. This lab is headed by Dr. Thomas Moyers, an irresponsible man who caused the creation of Rampage, the super-strong alter-ego of Dr. Kitty Faulkner, also in the employ is Amanda Waller operating under the orders of Sarge Steel. The chimpanzee gains his name from a mean-spirited joke by the other staffers. A brief visit by Lois Lane to the government laboratories ended soon after Titano tried to escape his tormentors by leaping into Lane's arms. An accident caused the ape to gain super-strength and grow to enormous proportions. Attempting to kill Moyers, whom he saw as his tormentor, Titano was stopped by and engaged in a battle with Superman. The presence of Lane causes Titano to calm down, as he considered her a friend. Moyers used his equipment to reverse the transformation. The reversal is too much for the chimpanzee, who dies in Lane's arms. She later writes the Daily Planet article \\"Tears for Titano\\" in honor of the animal. Another version of Titano appeared as the mascot of \\"Titano's Pizza\\". Television advertisements showed a giant ape in a chef's hat defeating \\"Turtle Boy\\", who represented the slower delivery of other pizzerias. However, Turtle Boy (played by Jimmy Olsen) proved to be much more popular than Titano, and the commercials were discontinued. In Action Comics #854, a monkey experimented upon by the Kryptonite Man was imbued with Kryptonite radiation, gaining the ability to grow in size and fire Kryptonite beams from his eyes, like the Pre-Crisis Titano. He was eventually calmed down by \\"Mr. Action\\" (Jimmy Olsen) and placed in the care of S.T.A.R. Labs. Titano's Pre-Crisis version would make a reappearance of sorts in Superman/Batman #28, as a guise for a shape-shifting telepathic alien entity. =The New 52= In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Titano was redesigned and given a new origin. Titano was now only slightly bigger than a regular gorilla rather than the giant of earlier versions, and was now an albino. He also was given a new origin in which he was a genetic mutation created by a deranged biophysicist. He was later shown on life support in a Metropolis laboratory and is executed by a creature appearing to be Superman. Titano was again redesigned by the creative team of Geoff Johns and John Romita Jr. This version was a giant chimpanzee robot with green-glowing inside parts, alluding to a Kryptonite origin. Other versions A Bizarro version of Titano from Bizarro World. Cover of Adventure Comics #295 (April 1962). Art by John Forte. =JLA: Earth 2= An antimatter version of Titano, appeared near the end of Grant Morrison's JLA: Earth 2. This version is actually a genetic experiment conducted by Brainiac and Ultraman (Subject 773, \\"Ultra-Titanus\\") freed by Brainiac and fires Anti- Kryptonite beams at Superman. Being an opposite version of Titano, the beams make him stronger. He is later caught by the Green Lantern. =DC One Million= In DC Comics' DC One Million setting, Titano One Million is the Superman-like defender of the Gorilla Galaxy, a direct descendant of Solovar. =Dark Nights: Metal= In the Dark Nights: Metal series, Titano is the Superman-analogue of Earth-53, a newly revealed DC Multiverse world analogous to the Gorilla Galaxy, along with a lemur Atom, Atlantean Sea Ape and Batape. In other media =Television= * The 1942 episode \\"Terror on the Midway\\" of the Fleischer Superman cartoons featured a battle between Superman and a massive escaped circus gorilla called \\"Gigantic\\". * A 1967 episode \\"The Chimp Who Made it Big\\" of The New Adventures of Superman was another version of the Titano story. This was done at the instigation of Superman editor Mort Weisinger, who served as story consultant for the animated series. A collision of a Kryptonite meteor and a uranium asteroid crash near the capsule Toto was in causes it to lose control. Superman saves the capsule and brings it down to Earth. When Lois Lane reports at the rocket base, Toto bursts from the capsule and transforms into Titano. He grabs Lois Lane and Superman tries to stop him but is hit by the giant ape's Kryptonite eye beams. When the military fires missiles at Titano, Superman protects him from the attack. Titano then escapes with Lois Lane while Superman pursues them. He makes a shield of lead and then knocks out Titano. A headline in the Daily Planet newspaper states that the Kryptonite's effects on Titano wore off and he was restored to his normal size. A clip from this episode was broadcast in the first test episode of Sesame Street. * Although not appearing in the 1988 animated series Superman, a large ape (presumably Titano) is seen in the opening credits scaling the side of the Daily Planet, in front of Clark Kent, Perry White, Jimmy Olsen, and Lois Lane, before Clark changes into Superman and pulls him off the building. * A different version of Titano, conceptually very similar to the original Titano from the Silver Age, appeared in the Superman: The Animated Series episode \\"Monkey Fun\\" with his vocal effects done by Frank Welker. This Titano was a chimpanzee astronaut that was kept in the home of Lt. Colonel Sam Lane. The chimp formed a bond with Lane's 8-year-old daughter Lois. Titano's ship, the Titan 0, from which he got his name, was lost in space and eventually found twenty years later in a meteor shower by Superman. Gases contained in the meteor caused him to grow to enormous proportions. The now- gigantic Titano wreaked havoc on Metropolis. Sam Lane, now a flag officer, rushes to Metropolis to aid Lois by giving her the one thing that could calm Titano: a toy monkey named Beppo that played Pop Goes the Weasel when squeezed. S.T.A.R. Labs is able to put an end to Titano's growth spurts. Superman then relocated Titano to a remote island to live a normal life-span, leaving Beppo for him as a memento of Lois. * Young Justice has a slight nod to the character in \\"Performance\\", where a poster at Haly's Circus advertises an elephant named Titano. * Titano appears in Justice League Action. In the episode \\"Harley Goes Ape\\", he was tended to by Dr. Harleen Quinzel before she worked at Arkham Asylum. Titano's history of being launched into outer space and coming in contact with a Kryptonite meteor is still intact. Placing a special helmet on Titano, Gorilla Grodd takes control of Titano and fights Superman in Metropolis. When Harley Quinn recognizes Titano, she helps Stargirl free Titano who then throws Gorilla Grodd into the direction of a police van. Titano then grabs Harley Quinn and climbs the Daily Planet until Stargirl calms Titano down before the police helicopters can fire on Titano. =Miscellaneous= * Titano made a cameo appearance in the comic book series based on Superman: The Animated Series. He nearly returned to Metropolis after an environmental terrorist group released him considering his relocation animal rights abuse. Titano was subdued and returned home before he made it to Metropolis. * In Tom DeHaven's 2005 novel, It's Superman!, Titano's equivalent \\"Gigantic\\" from the Fleischer cartoon is mentioned twice near the end of the novel. Homages Characters based on Titano have occasionally appeared in comics homaging the Silver Age Superman. * In Alan Moore's Supreme, the Titano equivalent is Stupendo, the Simian Supreme. Stupendo has a similar origin to the Silver Age Titano (except with Supremium radiation), but was subsequently befriended by Supreme, and given a home on Conqueror Island.
