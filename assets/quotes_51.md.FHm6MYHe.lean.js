Arthi is a form of bhakti devotion. The word also refers to the traditional devotional song that is sung during the ritual. Arthi is performed and sung to develop the highest love for God as incarnated in the person of Valmiki. Arthi is generally performed daily, and usually at the end of a pooja, bhajan session, or after reading the Ramayana in the Ashram. It is performed during almost all Balmiki ceremonies and occasions. It involves the circulating of an Arthi plate in front of the moorti of Valmiki and is accompanied by the Balmiki Arthi song. The poojari circulates the plate to all those present. They cup their down-turned hands over the flame and then raise their palms to their forehead - the purificatory blessing, passed from Valmiki's image to the flame, has now been passed to the devotee. The arthi plate is generally made of metal, usually silver, bronze or copper. On it must repose a lamp made of kneaded flour, mud or metal, filled with oil or ghee. A cotton wick is put into the oil and then lighted, or camphor is burnt instead. The plate also contains flowers, incense and akshata.

It consists of five versions. The first two, WZT-1 and WZT-2 were built on T-55/T-55A hull, the WZT-3 was built on T-72M hull, the WZT-3M was built on PT-91 hull and the WZT-4 was built on PT-91M hull for Malaysia. WZT-1 =History= In the early 50s USSR started developing an ARV built on the hull of T-54 that was just entering production. A prototype vehicle was completed after a short while and was named BTS-1 (BTS - Bronirowannyj Tjagacz Sriednij). Production was launched and it became the basic ARV of the Soviet army. In 1955 BTS-1 was upgraded with a hoist and a small folding crane. This upgraded version was given the name BTS-2. It was built on the T-54 hull and later on the T-55 hull. In the end of the 60s Poland and Czechoslovakia bought the BTS-2. Basing on BTS-2 technical data the Zak≈Çad Produkcji Do≈õwiadczalnej Zak≈Çad√≥w Mechanicznych \\"Bumar-≈Åabƒôdy\\" (Experimental Production Institute of \\"Bumar- ≈Åabƒôdy\\") prepared a prototype of WZT-1 ARV. It was accepted into the Ludowe Wojsko Polskie and became its basic ARV replacing the older designs. Production started in 1970 in \\"Bumar-≈Åabƒôdy\\" and continued until 1978 when it was completely replaced by WZT-2. The WZT-1 were used in the upgrade of Newa SAM system to Newa-SC standard. The launcher was mounted on a WZT-1 chassis (many sources claim the vehicle to be T-55 tank but as a matter of fact vehicles never had tank turret in the first place). Upgrade replaced many analogue components with digital ones for improved reliability and accuracy also improving mobility and also adds IFF capability and data links. Unlike oryginal ARV variant the Newa launcher is still in use in the armed forces of Poland. =Operators= * - former, some are used as chassis for Newa SC. WZT-2 Polish ARV built on T-55 hull. It was built to perform repairs on T-55 and T-55A tanks. When it entered service in 1973 it was probably the best ARV in the Warsaw Pact. It is still able to carry out tasks that NATO gives ARVs of its class. Unlike the T-55 and the WZT-1, the WZT-2 is still the basic ARV of the Polish army used for field repairs. It can carry out repairs not only on Soviet tanks like the T-54/T-55 and T-72 but also on Polish PT-91 and German Leopard 2A4 tanks. However because all tanks currently in Polish service weigh more than 40 tonnes it is not able to tow them. It is used to tow lighter vehicles like BWP-1 and 2S1.

The WZT-3M has an 850 hp (634 kW) PZL-Wola S12U 12-cyl. 38.9 litre diesel from PT-91.

He trained as an architect and joined the BBC design department in the 1970s, quickly gaining a reputation for great imagination and flair. He began working on Doctor Who when Philip Hinchcliffe took over as producer in late 1974. Hinchcliffe's vision for the series included giving a high priority to set design and he quickly realised that Murray-Leach was one of the most, if not the most, imaginative and resourceful designers on the BBC staff. Murray- Leach designed several Doctor Who serials under Hinchcliffe's reign, many of which remain amongst the most popular serials in the show's history. For the serial Planet of Evil, Murray-Leach designed an alien jungle at Ealing studios that so impressed Hinchcliffe that he wrote to the Head of the BBC design department, suggesting that Murray-Leach should be nominated for a BAFTA or a Royal Television Society Award. David Maloney, a director who had worked on a number of the Doctor Who serials designed by Murray-Leach, went on to produce Blake's 7 for the BBC and immediately secured the services of Murray-Leach to design the interior of the Liberator spacecraft. Murray-Leach was eventually nominated for a BAFTA award for his design work on the 1981 series Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years. His talent was finally being recognised and he broke into feature films, working as production designer on Local Hero, Defence of the Realm, Clockwise and A Fish Called Wanda. His movie career extended into the 1990s with The Mighty Quinn, Twenty-One and Fierce Creatures. In recent years he has appeared in a number of television and DVD documentaries discussing his work on Doctor Who, including A Darker Side, a retrospective feature included in the 2entertain/BBC DVD release of Planet of Evil, in which he and Hinchcliffe returned to Ealing studios to discuss the story's design and production.

Their secondary armament comprised eight 45-caliber quick-firing (QF) guns in casemates. For anti-torpedo boat defense, they carried four 45-caliber QF guns on the forecastle deck, as well as ten QF and four QF Hotchkiss guns. They were also armed with two submerged torpedo tubes. The Harvey armor belt of the Gueydon-class cruisers covered most of the ships' hull. The lower strake of armor was generally thick, although it reduced to forward, aft, and thinned to at its lower edge. The upper strake of armor had thicknesses of and between the main and upper decks. The curved lower protective deck ranged in thickness from 51 to 56 millimetres. In addition there was a light armor deck thick at the top of the lower armor strake. A watertight internal cofferdam, filled with cellulose, stretched between these two decks. The gun turrets were protected by armor and had roofs thick. The 100-millimetre guns were protected by gun shields and the sides of the conning tower were 160 millimetres thick.

It is a deep-bodied fish, occasionally confused with other similar species that occur within its range, but is generally distinguished from these species by a lack of yellow ventral and anal fins. Southern black bream are endemic to Australia, inhabiting the southern coast from Shark Bay in Western Australia to Mallacoota, Victoria, as well as Tasmania. The species is primarily an inhabitant of estuaries and coastal lakes, rarely entering the ocean, as it cannot complete its life cycle in a fully marine environment. During the breeding season, the species is known to penetrate into the upper reaches of rivers to spawn, causing an influx of juveniles in the estuaries a few months later. Southern black bream are opportunistic predators, consuming a wide range of crustaceans, molluscs, polychaetes and fish. The southern black bream is a major target for both commercial and amateur fishermen due to its high quality flesh, with over 300 tonnes of fish taken each year by commercial fisheries. Anglers also seek out the fish for its sporting qualities, with the development of lure fishing for bream adding to this attraction. Aquaculture techniques for the species are being developed, with a slow growth rate the major hurdle to large scale food production. Taxonomy and naming The southern black bream is one of 20 species in the genus Acanthopagrus, part of the porgy family Sparidae. The Sparidae are perciform fish in the suborder Percoidei. The southern black bream was at first confused with its nearly identical east coast relative, the surf bream (Acanthopagrus australis), with specimens initially grouped under the name Mylio australis by Rudall, Hale and Sheriden. In a 1949 review of the Australian \\"silver breams,\\" Ian Munro found that M. australis was in fact two separate species, creating the new species name of Mylio butcheri to accommodate the southern black bream. Munro based this classification on a number of new specimens, one of which was from the Gippsland Lakes, Victoria, which he designated to be the holotype. Mylio butcheri was later changed to Acanthopagrus butcheri when the true genus of the species was identified. Acanthopagrus butcheri has a number of common names, many of which are applied to a number of related fish species, both in Australia and worldwide. The species is commonly referred to in publications as the \\"southern black bream\\" to avoid confusion with the black sea bream and other closely related species loosely given the name \\"black bream.\\" The species is known regionally by the names \\"black bream,\\" \\"Perth bream,\\" \\"Gippsland bream\\" and the \\"blue-nose bream.\\" The latter name is given to mature fish over 1 kg in weight, as at this point their snouts begin to develop a bluish tinge. The Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts of the Federal Government designated black bream as preferred name. Black bream has also been designated the standard name by the CSIRO Division of Marine and Atmospheric Research in commercial fishing in Australia. Description The southern black bream has a deep, moderately compressed body, with both the dorsal and ventral profiles equally curved. The mouth is of moderate size in comparison with the body, and contains six curved, peg like incisors in the front of both upper and lower jaws. The molars are set in series of four or five on each side of the upper jaw, and in series of three or four on the sides of the lower jaw, becoming smaller in size anteriorly. The body is covered with large scales, which may be cycloid or weakly ctenoid in shape. The head is mostly scale-free, with the exception of parts of the operculum. A low, scaly sheath covers the bases of the soft dorsal, anal and caudal fins. The lateral line scale count is 52‚Äì58. There is a single dorsal fin originating a little behind the posterior edge of the operculum, consisting of 10 to 13 spines set in front of 10 to 13 soft rays. The anal fin consists of 3 spines anterior to 8 to 10 soft rays, while the pectoral fin has 14 to 16 rays and the ventral has one large spine and 5 soft rays. The southern black bream is golden brown or bronze coloured on the back and sides, with greenish reflections when fresh, while the belly and chin are white. The fins are all dusky in colour, with the caudal fin often a dusky olive brown. The species has been known to reach a total maximum length of and a weight of , but is much more common around and under 2 kg. Distribution and habitat The southern black bream is endemic to southern Australia, inhabiting coastal waters from Shark Bay, Western Australia in the west to Mallacoota, Victoria in the east and south around the entire Tasmanian coastline. The species is primarily an inshore species, although has been found on rare occasions on deeper reefs on the continental shelf. Southern black bream primarily inhabit estuarine environments, penetrating into the far reaches of freshwater creeks and rivers during the summer spawning season. They are also known from a number of coastal lakes and intermittently open estuaries. In estuarine and freshwater environments they seek out the cover of structures such as fallen tree branches, jetties, oyster leases and rocky areas, while in deeper areas of coastal lakes, they are often found over bare mud and sand substrates. The species is rarely found in the ocean, but are often washed out of creeks during times of high river flow and are able to survive in the marine environment, where they inhabit inshore reefs and rocky shorelines. The species is most common in southern Victoria, where it inhabits numerous estuaries. The Gippsland Lakes, Mallacoota Inlet and Lake Tyers are the most densely populated bodies of water in the state and the species is often found along the coast. It is not as prolific in South Australia, with the Coorong and Kangaroo Island being the main bream-producing areas in the state. The low numbers may be correlated with the state's lack of rivers and estuaries, although bream have been caught in unexpected areas, including the Gulfs, as well as deep rocky reefs off Streaky Bay in lobster traps. Southern black bream are prevalent in southern Western Australia, with large numbers of estuaries holding the species. The Culham and Stokes Inlets are known to have large populations of the fish. Biology =Diet and feeding= Southern black bream are opportunistic omnivores, consuming a wide range of prey, including sessile, burrowing, benthic and pelagic species. The diet of the species varies between rivers, with their opportunistic feeding methods showing little pattern between seasons, although they appear to have certain prey preferences when two or more possible prey species are present. Crustaceans, including crabs, prawns, amphipods and copepods, are commonly taken, as are a number of polychaete and annelid worms. Bivalves such as mussels and cockles are crushed in the bream's powerful jaws, with small fish such as gobies and anchovies also taken. Algae of the genus Enteromorpha are also a major component of most fish's diets. Fish feeding in the upper reaches of river have different prey, reflecting the freshwater fauna, with insects, hardyheads, tadpoles, brine shrimp and gastropods taken. Studies from the Swan River suggest that there is a shift in diet with age. Younger fish consume amphipods, polychaetes and small individuals of various molluscs. The number of amphipods consumed decreased in the diets of older fish while the number of large molluscs, crabs and teleosts taken increased. The fish actively forage the substrate while swimming with their head down, snapping their prey down with little chewing. =Life cycle= Southern black bream become sexually mature at different ages throughout their range, with Western and South Australian fish maturing by two to three years of age, while Victorian fish mature at five years. There is also a difference in maturation age between the sexes, as females generally mature one year later than males. The timing of spawning is also variable over the species range, with fish in Western Australia able to spawn from July to November, South Australian fish spawning between November and January and Victorian fish in October to November. Reproducing fish migrate into the upper reaches of rivers and streams, where they shed their eggs, with each fish producing up to three million per season. The eggs are small and pelagic, hatching two days or so after fertilisation. The young bream spend the next four years of their lives living in rivers, estuaries and parts of the coastline, often seen schooling over seagrass beds in shallow reaches of estuaries. It is when they reach five years in age that fish living in the marine environment move offshore to deeper reefs, returning to the rivers to spawn, as they cannot complete their life cycle in the ocean. Southern black bream are known to live to 29 years of age. A number of unusual reproductive features have been observed in the species including a number hermaphroditic individuals which have both functional ovaries and testes, with the ability for a change to the preference of one sex also occasionally observed. The species has also been known to hybridise with the closely related species Acanthopagrus australis forming viable offspring, themselves able to backcross with the parent species. This is only known from one coastal lake where the two species are landlocked together for extended periods, promoting interbreeding and the production of offspring with morphological traits intermediate between the two species. The setting required to cause hybridisation, however is too rare to consider the two species subspecies, or even a single species. =Predators= Apart from humans, a variety of seabirds are the southern black bream's main predators, with the pelican, little black cormorant and great cormorant prominent. The species is also taken by larger fish including sharks, rays and a number of large predatory teleosts such as mulloway and flathead. A number of ectoparasites are known from the species, including species from the Copepoda, Monogenea, Branchiura, Isopoda and Hirudinea. Relationship to humans Southern black bream are one of the most important species to both commercial and recreational fisheries throughout its range, valued for its flavoursome and moist flesh. Due to its marketability, as well as its high tolerance to a wide range of salinity, the species has become a candidate for inland aquaculture in saline dams. =Commercial fishery= The southern black bream is one of the most important species to the commercial fisheries in both Victoria and southern Western Australia, although only small numbers are harvested in South Australian waters due to the lower populations. Victoria produces the majority of the catch, with the Gippsland region alone producing 80% of the state's haul. A. butcheri has been taken from the Gippsland Lakes since the 1880s when they were the predominantly targeted species, although during the 1920s mullet became the most frequently caught species in the lakes. The bream catch from the lakes now fluctuates between 200 and 400 tonnes per year. The Mallacoota inlet and Lake Tyers make up the other important bream-producing regions of the state. In South Australia, bream are only commercially taken from the Coorong which has yielded 10 to 70 tonnes of the species per year since the 1970s. In lower Western Australia the Culham and Stokes inlet produce the bulk of the state's catch, with annual hauls far greater now than during the early 1990s. During the 1970s and 1980s, Western Australia had a modest bream catch of around 26 tonnes per year, a figure which rocketed to 103.9 tonnes in the 1992/3 season before receding to around 28 tonnes per year since 2000. The species is commonly taken by gill nets, beach seine and haul nets, as well as by handline. The fish are normally sold fresh whole or as fillets in local markets throughout the states they are taken in. =Recreational fishery= A southern black bream caught from Snowy River, Victoria Southern black bream have long been a favourite target for anglers who seek out the species for both its fighting qualities and high quality flesh. Bream are also popular due to their accessibility, with fish commonly caught from harbour and estuary banks, piers and rock walls, therefore eliminating the need for a boat in most regions. Research in Western Australia has shown that anglers take more bream than commercial fishermen, with a 1979 study indicating that at least 232 tonnes were taken, more than double that of the commercial harvest at its peak, although with the advent of catch and release fishing this figure has dropped. Bream are commonly caught around structures within an estuary, including fallen branches, piers, rock walls, bridge abutments and other man made structures as well as on mud and sand banks where shellfish and crustaceans dwell. Although bream are opportunistic feeders, they can often be very difficult to catch in areas subject to high fishing pressure. Light fishing lines and sinkers are used to avoid spooking the fish and, as with all fishing, live bait produces the best results. Various crustaceans such as nippers, prawns and crabs are commonly used alongside various species of beach and tube worm. Frozen and cut bait such as prawns, mussels, cockles and fish pieces are also effective. Rigs are usually kept simple and light, with running ball or bean sinkers used on a light line from two up to four kilograms in breaking strength tied to a size 6 ‚Äì 1 hook. In fast flowing waters, heavier sinkers may be needed to keep the bait in the target area long enough to be noticed by a fish. Burley is often introduced into the water, with chopped pilchards or chicken pellets soaked in fish oil popular amongst anglers. In recent years, the use of lures and flies on southern black bream has been successfully developed, with the species known to attack both hard bodied minnow and spinnerbait type lures, as well as soft plastic lures and saltwater flies. The southern black bream is protected by size and bag limits in all the states it inhabits, which anglers must be aware of or face fines. In Western Australia the size limit is 25 cm with only 2 fish over 40 cm allowed to be taken from the Swan or Canning Rivers, while the bag limit varies throughout the state with West Coast allowing 4 per angler, Gascoyne 8 per angler, and Southern and Northern 20 per angler. In South Australia the daily bag limit is 10 per person, with a minimum legal size of 30 cm, which is the same limit as Victoria. =Aquaculture= Southern black bream are relatively easy to grow in captivity, with fish usually spawning during their natural season without needing the addition of hormones.Partridge G.J., Jenkins G.I. & Frankish K.R. (2003) Hatchery Manual for the Production of Snapper (Pagrus auratus) and Black Bream (Acanthopagrus butcheri). WestOne Publishing, Perth, Australia. Despite this, bream are not bred on a commercial basis due to a comparatively slow growth rate and a low fillet recovery. Studies by Sarre in 1999, however, showed that the species can survive well in saline ponds with deep enough waters as long as food is supplemented to the ponds. This has led to the proposal of the breeding of the species to stock inland saline ponds for the use of recreational fishing, much like trout and barramundi are stocked elsewhere in Australia. Although the growth rate is currently too slow for food production purposes, genetic selection may allow the breeding of faster-growing fish for market purposes. Southern black bream are currently bred to stock depleted estuaries, and thus their requirements for farming are already well known. Similar species A number of other members of the Sparidae inhabit Australian waters and maybe confused with A. butcheri. The yellowfin bream, Acanthopagrus australis is the most similar species to A. butcheri, overlapping in northern Victoria, with hybridisation events suggesting a recent divergence time, allowing few genetic differences to accumulate between the species. As its name suggests, the yellow fins of the yellowfin bream are distinctive. Overlapping the distribution of A. butcheri in the west is Acanthopagrus morrisoni, the western yellowfin bream, which can be distinguished by the prominent yellow ventral, anal and lower caudal fins. The tarwhine, Rhabdosargus sarba, is also similar in shape, but possesses gold horizontal stripes which allow for identification.

Biography  Latham became an orphan in early childhood when his parents Thomas Latham (a coast guard) and Isabella (n√©e Isum) died before the age of 8. Latham moved to New South Wales in Australia with his siblings in 1890 and married Marie Louisa von Allw√∂rden on 24 June 1903 at Hay in the same state. In 1910, Latham moved to Western Australia to take up of land at East Kumminin (now Narembeen), east of Perth. In his early farming days, he was unsuccessful, but was not deterred by the 1914 drought and owned of land in 1921 when he entered parliament. In 1916 Latham enlisted in the entirely volunteer-run First Australian Imperial Force and was promoted to the rank of Corporal in January 1917. He was wounded in France in March 1918. Latham was promoted Sergeant in 1919 and was discharged in May of that year.  Political career  Latham became the Country Party (now National Party) candidate for the Legislative Assembly seat of York in 1921 and became a MLC following this endorsement. Before the First World War Latham was a member of the Bruce Rock Road Board before the war, but upon his return to Australia he became the chairman of the Narembeen Road Board in 1924. In 1930 Latham became the parliamentary leader of the Country Party and fervently rallied for farmers' rights. Later that year he joined the Party with the Nationalist Party and served as deputy Premier of Western Australia under James Mitchell from 1930 to 1933. From 1933 onwards, Latham was the Leader of the Opposition until 1942, when he resigned to fill a vacancy in the Australian Senate but lost the 1943 election. Latham then returned to Parliament in 1946 to serve as a Member of the Legislative Council, became Minister for Agriculture in 1952‚Äì53 and retired in 1960, after another two years as the President of the Legislative Council.

B. Priestley. Written in 1929, it follows the fortunes of a concert party on a tour of England. It is Priestley's most famous novel, and it established him as a national figure. It won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize and was adapted twice into film.  Plot summary  Judi Dench in \\"The Good Companions\\" The novel is written in picaresque style, and opens with the middle aged, discontented Jess Oakroyd in the fictional Yorkshire town of Bruddersford. He opts to leave his family and seek adventure \\"on t'road\\" (throughout the novel Priestley uses dialect for all non-RP speakers of English). He heads south down the Great North Road. Intertwined with the story of Oakroyd's travels are those of Elizabeth Trant and Inigo Jollifant, two similarly malcontented individuals. Miss Trant is an upper-middle class \\"spinster\\" and Jollifant is a teacher at a down-at-heel private school. All three ultimately encounter each other when a failing concert troupe ('The Dinky Doos') are disbanding as a result of their manager's running off with the takings. The independently wealthy Miss Trant, against the advice of her relatives, decides to refloat the troupe, now known as 'The Good Companions'. Inigo plays piano and writes songs, Oakroyd is the odd-job man, and the troupe has also been joined by Mr Morton Mitcham (a travelling banjo player and conjuror whom Inigo met earlier on his own odyssey). The other members of the troupe are comedian Jimmy Nunn; song-and- dance man Jerry Jerningham; singers Elsie Longstaff, Courtney (aka Joe) Brundit, and Joe's wife (referred to as \\"Mrs. Joe\\"); and singer-comedienne Susie Dean. The troupe have various adventures round the shires of middle England. After a sabotaged performance, the troupe disband: Jerry marries Lady Partlit, a fan; Susie and Inigo become successful and famous in London; Miss Trant marries a long lost sweetheart; Jess Oakroyd emigrates to Canada and the other performers carry on with their life on the road.  Literary significance and reception  The Good Companions was an instant hit on publication, but was not particularly well regarded by critics. Despite this, it remained popular for over forty years. It then fell out of favour, not only because the novel was written from a (rather old fashioned) middle class perspective but also because it deals with a phenomenon (a travelling music hall troupe) which no longer exists. More recently there has been a reappraisal of this and other Priestley works: a new edition of The Good Companions appeared in October 2007 with a foreword by Dame Judi Dench, accompanying a reappraisal of the various versions by Ronald Harwood, Andr√© Previn and Alan Plater amongst others.  Dramatic adaptations  = 1931 theatrical adaptation = Priestley collaborated with Edward Knoblock on a stage version of his novel, which opened at His Majesty's Theatre, London on 14 May 1931. It ran for nine months, with Edward Chapman, Edith Sharpe and John Gielgud in the cast. = 1933 film version = The first film version appeared hard on the heels of the play. Produced by Gaumont, it starred John Gielgud as Ingo Jollifant, Jessie Matthews as Susie Dean and Edmund Gwenn as Jess Oakroyd. = 1957 film version = A Technicolor remake was directed by J. Lee Thompson for Associated British Picture Corporation, and starred Eric Portman as Oakroyd, Celia Johnson as Miss Trant, Joyce Grenfell as Lady Partlit, Janette Scott as Susie Dean, John Fraser as Inigo Jollifant and Rachel Roberts as Elsie and Effie Longstaff. This version updates the narrative and music to the late 'fifties (with a score by Laurie Johnson) when touring shows were in decline. It did not replicate the success of the book, and signified the end of the novel's popular success. It came to be typified by the contemporaneous Angry Young Men of British stage and screen as the kind of unrealistic depiction of working class Britain they were struggling to be free of. = 1974 stage musical = On 11 July 1974 a musical adaptation, directed by Braham Murray with a libretto by Ronald Harwood, music by Andr√© Previn and lyrics by Johnny Mercer (in his last show) opened at Her Majesty's Theatre in London ‚Äì the same venue of the stage play over forty years earlier (having had its world premiere at the Palace Theatre in Manchester).

The city hall is located here. Rijen is situated north of the A58, between Breda and Tilburg. Surrounding places are: Dorst, Dongen and Oosterhout. Rijen has over 16,840 inhabitants.  History  Rijen has been a hamlet of Gilze for years, which belonged to the Barony of Breda. In 1464 a chapel was added to this hamlet and was raised to an independent parish. Rijen stayed smaller than Gilze for a long time. In the period of 1831-1838, during the Belgian Revolution, many Dutch soldiers were encamped at Rijen. A few years later, in 1863, the Gilze-Rijen station was opened. This gave the opportunity for the industry to grow. Especially the leather industry grew very fast and the town with it. During the second World War, the existing town hall in Gilze was destroyed and rebuilt in the now bigger Rijen.  Public transport  Gilze- Rijen railway station is located at the south of Rijen, trains in the directions of Breda, Tilburg, 's-Hertogenbosch and Dordrecht leave here.

The Army became the core for the Soviet occupational force (OKSVA) in Afghanistan in 1980s, officially named as the limited contingent of Soviet forces in Afghanistan. First formation (World War II) It was first formed, after Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, had commenced, from elements of the 26th and 37th Armies under the command of Major General Kuzma Petrovich Podlas in August 1941 at the boundary of the Bryansk Front and the Soviet Southwestern Front. By 25 August 1941 the 135th and 293rd Rifle Divisions, 2nd Airborne Corps, 10th Tank Division, and 5th Anti-Tank Brigade had been assembled to form the force.John Erickson, The Road to Stalingrad, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London, 1975, p.202 As part of the Southwestern Front, it then took part in the Battle of Kiev (1941), where the Army was badly shattered, and General- Major Semenchenko's 10th Tank Division was reduced to twenty tanks.Erickson, The Road to Stalingrad, 2003 paperback edition, p.207, 210 By the time of the main German offensive against Moscow at the end of September, 40th Army was on the extreme right flank of Southwestern Front defending the Kursk axis. The German offensive was directed primarily at Soviet forces to the north of 40th Army, though the attack of the German 48th Motorised (Panzer) Corps, which was operating on the extreme southern flank of Second Panzer Group, also hit 40th Army's right flank positions. 40th Army began a slow and steady retreat to the east. By 3 November 40th Army had been driven from Kursk, but by the end of the month it had brought the German advance to a halt near the town of Tim some 50 kilometres further east. As part of a general winter offensive by the Red Army across the entire Eastern Front, on 1 January 1942 40th Army, by then based on six rifle divisions and two tank brigades, attacked German positions east of Tim. Off 40th Army's right flank the 13th Army had for several weeks been conducting offensive operations towards Orel, advancing some 50 kilometres to the west and retaking Elets and Kastornoye in the process. The advance of 40th Army was less rapid. By 3 January 40th Army, in conjunction with 21st Army further south, was involved in heavy fighting on the line of the Seym river as the two armies attempted to advance on Kursk and Oboyan respectively. 40th Army retook Tim and advanced to within 30 kilometres of Kursk before being stopped by determined German resistance in mid-January. Thereafter the frontline stabilised west of Tim through the rest of the winter and through the spring. On 3 April 40th Army and its sector of the frontline was assigned to the command of Bryansk Front. On 12 May 1942 Southwestern Front launched a major offensive to retake Kharkov by an encirclement from north and south. At the same time Bryansk Front was preparing an offensive of its own to retake Orel. However, by 16 May the offensive by Southwestern Front north of Kharkov had stalled and Bryansk Front was ordered to divert the bulk of its combat aircraft to 40th Army in the south and to launch an immediate offensive by 40th Army to support Southwestern Front's right wing. However, this hurriedly prepared offensive by 40th Army in the second half of May made little progress. In June 1942, Operation Blau saw Hoth's Fourth Panzer Army thrust in full force against 40th Army, which had its headquarters overrun by 24th Panzer Division on 29‚Äì30 June. The 40th Army fell back from the Kastornoye area back to Voronezh, alongside the 4th, 17th, and 24th Tank Corps.Erickson, 2003, p.356-8 In response, the STAVKA hastened to establish the new Voronezh Front. During July, 40th Army, subordinated to Voronezh Front, was assigned to defend the river Don along the Liski - Pavlovsk sector, positions that it held throughout the remainder of 1942. On 12 January 1943 40th Army began offensive operations against the left flank of the Hungarian Second Army north of Liski. This offensive was coordinated with an attack by a Soviet tank army further south to surround Axis forces on the Liski - Novaya Kalitva sector of the Don front. By 18 January most of the Hungarian army and an Italian corps had been surrounded east of Alekseyevka. The advance of 40th Army had left the German Second Army in exposed positions at Voronezh and, in a hurriedly prepared offensive coordinated with three other Soviet armies further north, 40th Army struck north on 24 January to surround much of Second Army east of Kastornoye. Having barely completed this operation, on 2 February 40th Army was launched into an offensive on the Kharkov axis to the southwest. It took Novy Oskol on 5 February and reached Belgorod four days later. Continuing to the southwest, 40th Army had reached Akhtyrka northwest of Kharkov by 23 February, but by then a German counter-offensive on the Kharkov axis had developed and 40th Army was pushed back to defensive positions east of Sumy. These defensive positions, which were to form part of the southern face of the Kursk Salient, remained largely unchanged through April, May and June 1943. In March 1943 6th Pontoon Bridge Brigade joined the army. On 5 July 1943 Germany's last strategic offensive on the Eastern Front (Operation Citadel) opened with attacks on the northern and southern shoulders of the Kursk Salient. The objective was to envelop and destroy the defending Central and Voronezh Fronts north and south of Kursk. At that time 40th Army, occupying what was expected to be a relatively quiet sector of the frontline facing the left flank of the German Fourth Panzer Army, was based on seven rifle divisions with armoured support. During the Battle of Kursk, where the Army fought as part of Voronezh Front, it transferred a number of reinforcements to 6th Guards Army to help 6th Guards hold back the 48th Panzer Corps, including the 29th Tank Destroyer Brigade and the 1244th and 869th Tank Destroyer Regiments, a total of over 100 antitank guns.Walter S. Dunn Jr, Kursk: Hitler's Gamble 1943, Praeger Publishers, 1997 (Chapter 9: Cracking the Second Defensive Line) 40th Army also transferred a tank brigade to 38th Army at the same time. After the battle, it was involved in the crossing of the Dnepr in September 1943 in conjunction with airborne operations.Nikolai Viktorovich Staskov, 1943 Dnepr airborne operation: lessons and conclusions Military Thought, July 2003 The Army was later involved in the Battle of Kiev (1943) and in 1944, as part of 2nd Ukrainian Front, actions around the Korsun- Cherkassy Pocket, Kamenets-Podolsky pocket, and the Uman-Botoshany, Iassy- Kishinev, Bratislava-Brno, and Prague Offensives.Aberjona Press, Slaughterhouse, 2005 It also fought in the Battle of Debrecen, at which, due to its low priority, it only had five divisions assigned. 40th Army was disbanded in July 1945. Second formation (OKSVA) The Army was re-created on December 16, 1979, in the Turkestan Military District on the directive of the General Staff of the USSR Armed Forces.

The commanding officer of the army was appointed Lieutenant General Yuri Tukharinov, who was the first deputy CO of the Turkestan MD. To cover the boundary with unstable Afghanistan, three motor rifle divisions (the 5th Guards, 108th and 68th) were pulled to the region. From December 3‚Äì16, 1979 two battalions of the 345th Separate Guards Airborne Regiment and the special operation GRU unit (Muslim battalion) was deployed to the airport in Bagram (Afghanistan) as the situation in the Central Asian country had deteriorated. December 1979, the last operation of the Soviet Army Airborne (Grudzie≈Ñ 1979 - ostatnia operacja powietrznodesantowa Armii Radzieckiej) On December 8, 1979, a meeting between Brezhnev, Andropov, Suslov, and Gromyko took place to discuss the situation in Afghanistan. In a couple of days the minister of defense Marshal Dmitriy Ustinov communicated to the Chief of the General Staff Nikolai Ogarkov that the Politburo adopted a decision on the temporary introduction of troops in the country and ordered to prepare somewhere around 75,000-80,000 concentration of force. Ustinov issued an oral order \\"No. 312/12/00133\\" on creation of a new general purpose army in the Turkestan MD. Only on December 12, 1979, the Politburo has officially adopted the decision on the introduction of the Soviet Army in Afghanistan. Next day an operative group of the Ministry of Defense was formed led by the deputy Chief of the General Staff General Sergei Akhromeyev, later replaced by the Marshal of the Soviet Union Sergei Sokolov. On December 14 at 22:00 the operative group arrived to Termez, Tajik SSR, the same day the special KGB group \\"Grom\\" arrived to Kabul to reinforce another group \\"Zenit-2\\". The field headquarters of the army was deployed in the Turkestan MD, while its aviation support by the 34th Mixed Aviation Corps in the Turkestan MD. On December 24, 1979 Minister of Defense Ustinov officially announced about the adopted decision to invade Afghanistan and signed the directive #312/12/001. Next day there were deployed around 100 different units. Out of the reserves were drafted additional 50,000 people from the Central Asian republics and the Kazakh SSR, some 8,000 units of automobiles were transferred out of the public sector. =Turkestan MD contingent= * 5th Guards Motor Rifle Zimovniki Division in Kushka ** 101st Motor Rifle Regiment ** 12th Guard Motor Rifle Regiment (introduced in March 1985) ** 371st Guards Motor Rifle Berlin Regiment ** 373rd Guards Motor Rifle Regiment (transformed into 70th Separate Guard Motor Rifle Brigade in March 1980) ** 24th Guards Tank Paris Regiment (introduced in October 1986) ** 1060th Artillery Regiment ** 1008th Flak Artillery Regiment (transformed into 1122nd Anti-Aircraft Missile Regiment in February 1980) ** 1122nd Flak Missile Sevastopol Regiment (introduced in October 1986) * 108th Motor Rifle Nevel Division in Termez ** 177th Motor Rifle Dvina Regiment ** 180th Motor Rifle Regiment ** 181st Motor Rifle Regiment ** 186th Motor Rifle Vyborg Regiment (in March 1980 transformed into 66th Separate Motor Rifle Brigade) ** 285th Tank Uman-Warsaw Regiment (transferred from 201st Motor Rifle Gatchina Division, in March 1984 transformed into 682nd Motor Rifle Regiment) ** 682nd Motor Rifle Uman-Warsaw Regiment ** 1074th Lvov Artillery Regiment ** 1049th Flak Artillery Regiment (introduced in November 1981) ** 1415th Flak Missile Regiment (dropped in October 1986) * 353rd Gun Artillery Brigade * 2nd Anti- Aircraft Missile Brigade * 56th Guards Air Assault Brigade * 103rd Separate Communications Regiment * 28th Rocket Artillery Regiment * 58th Motor Rifle Division (reserve) =Turkestan MD Contingent= Soviet 40th Army in the opening days of the invasion of Afghanistan * 860th Separate Motor-Rifle Regiment * 186th Separate Motor-Rifle Regiment (former 108th Motor-Rifle Division) * 68th Motor-Rifle Division (reserve) * 201st Motor Rifle Division (reserve) =Aviation support= * 136th Fighter-Bomber Aviation Regiment * 217th Fighter-Bomber Aviation Regiment * 115th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment * 181st Helicopter Regiment * 218th Helicopter Regiment * 302nd Helicopter Squadron of the 5th Guard Motor-Rifle Division =Additional support= * 103rd Guards Airborne Division ** 317th Airborne Regiment ** 350th Airborne Regiment ** 357th Airborne Regiment ** 1179th Artillery Regiment * 345th Guards Airborne Regiment The army entered Afghanistan (as part of the beginning of the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War) in December 1979 without the last division, but had the 201st MRD added to its composition during January 1980.

The track is the album's only song that was neither written nor co-written by Nicks. Written by Tom Petty and Mike Campbell as a Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers song, Jimmy Iovine, who was also working for Stevie Nicks at the time, arranged for her to sing on it. Petty sang with Nicks in the chorus and bridge, while his entire band (save Ron Blair, whose bass track was played by Donald \\"Duck\\" Dunn instead) played on the song. A performance of the song in the studio was used as the promotional video. The video was the 25th video to be played on MTV's launch date on August 1, 1981. Petty and Nicks also sang together on the songs \\"Insider\\" (from Petty's album Hard Promises (1981)) and \\"I Will Run to You\\" (from Nicks' album The Wild Heart (1983)), and frequently performed impromptu live versions of these and 1960s classic \\"Needles and Pins\\" in many shows through the 1980s. As of 2017, \\"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around\\" remains a mainstay of Stevie Nicks's solo performances, and on July 9, 2017, Nicks performed the song together with Petty and the Heartbreakers at the British Summer Time festival at Hyde Park in London, in what turned out to be their final performance of the song together before Petty's death in October 2017. The song peaked at No. 3 on the American Billboard Hot 100 for six consecutive weeks. However, in the United Kingdom, the song only managed to peak at No. 50. The song also appeared in the drama film Taps (1981). Content In a November 2003 interview with Songfacts, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers guitarist and primary songwriter Mike Campbell explained the song's origins: The lyrics are about a woman who feels weighed down by relationships and wants to part despite a strong sentimental attachment to her lover. The melody is described by All Music as \\"dark and sinister\\", probably because of the dense drumming of Stan Lynch which is the most prominent feature of the song's rhythm. Apart from the intro before the first verse and a solo following the second verse (where there is some fairly heavy riffing), however, the guitar sound is laid-back in typical Heartbreakers style. The song was originally recorded for Petty's album Hard Promises, but the producers felt the song came from a female point of view and it was left unreleased until it was agreed to be put on the Bella Donna album instead. A demo version of the song, recorded without Nicks, was eventually released on Petty's boxed set Playback (1995). Single release formats \\"Stop Draggin' My Heart Around\\" was released as a 7\\" vinyl single in the picture sleeve featured above in many territories.

This motion disturbs the double layer that exists at the particle-fluid interface. The picture illustrates the mechanism of this distortion. Practically all particles in fluids carry a surface charge. This surface charge is screened with an equally charged diffuse layer; this structure is called the double layer. Ions of the diffuse layer are located in the fluid and can move with the fluid. Fluid motion relative to the particle drags these diffuse ions in the direction of one or the other of the particle's poles. The picture shows ions dragged towards the left hand pole. As a result of this drag, there is an excess of negative ions in the vicinity of the left hand pole and an excess of positive surface charge at the right hand pole. As a result of this charge excess, particles gain a dipole moment. These dipole moments generate an electric field that in turn generates measurable electric current. This phenomenon is widely used for measuring zeta potential in concentrated colloids.

History In the 7th and 8th century the Slavs started to settle the areas along the Saale and Roda, two local rivers. The origin of the community Tr√∂bnitz is most probably to find at a sorbian hamlet at the beginning of the 12th century. It is mentioned in a document from 29 September 1223 the first time. At this date Sorbs cleared the woodlands near the confluence of the Roda (former Rodaue) and the Rothehofbach. Around 1300 Tr√∂bnitz was the manor of earl Otto de Trebnitz, but later the earls of Meusebach owned it. Hans and Apitz, two earls from Meusebach, became the first medieval judges and landlords of the early settlement. As the last member of the house of the Meusebacher died in 1753 things changed. The woodsmen decided to work as farmers. The new farmers bought huge areas of the former large scale land-holding and a long lasting economy was established. Up to the halfway of the 20th century the economical establishment in Tr√∂bnitz was pushed on by the family Prager and later the families Letsch and John. They had had a similar influence on the development of this village as the earls from Meusebach in the past. The rural structure remained till the foundation of the GDR. In 1956 a transformation of the small farms into a big cooperation took place (so called \\"LPGs\\", Landwirtschaftliche Produktionsgenossenschaften, were formed). With the separation of livestock production and agriculture in 1975 the traditional farming ended. The cooperations were less productive. That's why a mill that could grind and cut and a brewery were built at the beginning of the industrialization. After Germany was reunited the mill and the brewery were not competitive enough and so they had to be shut down. =The name of the village= The name Tr√∂bnitz is based on the name \\"trebenic\\", as it was called around 1115. As languages can develop throughout the time, this name did as well: 1266 ‚ÄûTrebenitz‚Äú, 1300 ‚ÄûTrebnitz‚Äú und um 1310 ‚ÄûTrebenicz‚Äú. The origin of this term is to find in the settlements of the slavs that lived in this region before. A lot of Slavic settlements that still exist have typical suffixes, like -ow, -in, -itz and ‚Äìgast. Culture and sights The so-called \\"Art and Music Village\\" is well known for its two orchestras, the ‚ÄûTr√∂bnitzer Musikanten‚Äú and the ‚ÄûJugendblasorchester Tr√∂bnitz‚Äú. You can find a new arranged museum, that shows regional history, the YMCA and the \\"Klingenpresse\\", an art club, in Tr√∂bnitz as well.

He came from Kaga Province, the centre of the lands of the Maeda clan. He fell afoul of his teacher, Kan≈ç Tan'y≈´, and became the Maeda clan's official painter. His sympathy for farmers and the poor people of the Edo period is reflected in his works. His daughter, Kiyohara Yukinobu (1643‚Äì1682), was also an artist, one of the few female painters of the Edo period.  Background  Little is documented about Morikage‚Äôs career as an artist. It is apparent, however, that his skills were revered amongst the most talented Kan≈ç pupils. His work was most prominent when he was commissioned as a proficient Kan≈ç painter to paint the Landscape of the Four Seasons. Today, Morikage is best known as the Kan≈ç pupil who departed from the famous school and its rigid beliefs to pursue individual expression. His passion is evident in the transformation of his conservative art style into one that captured cultural values of Edo Japan, ultimately creating art that held social value. Although his artistic career is not well chronicled, Kusumi Morikage can be considered a pioneer who visually conceptualised ‚Äúrural manners and customs‚Äù. Some notable works include: Family Enjoying the Evening Cool, Falconry Folding Screens and Farming in the Four Seasons.  Edo Period  Morikage is best known as a Kan≈ç artist in the Edo period. This period was also known as the Tokugawa period (1603 ‚Äì 1867), named after its founder, Tokugawa Ieyasu. In this era, Tokugawa created a nation that aimed for economic growth, political stability and social harmony in order to maintain overall peace and national prosperity. In his shogunate (military dictatorship), determining that the nation was still susceptible to the influence of external ideas and interventions, Tokugawa implemented a long era of national seclusion to protect his rule from political and religious instability. However, since it was vital to preserve social order in a way that would continue to sustain the nation and generate economic profit without external affiliations, the shogun tightened the reins on social order and outlawed movement between social classes. These social classes were divided into four groups - warriors, farmers, merchants and artisans, where farmers made up eighty percent of the population and were prohibited from engaging in activities that were non- agricultural. In this way, the Tokugawa shogunate placed considerable importance on agricultural production, which became a sizeable source of income for those in places of power. Farmers were thus viewed as vital to the stability of the economy, as their labour also paved the way to dynamic art cultures. One such dynamic art culture is found in Morikage‚Äôs sympathy with the social and political circumstances surrounding rural Edo Japan, as the agricultural industry‚Äôs labour fuelled Edo Japan. This prominent theme is manifested in many of his artworks during later stages in his life.  Education  = Kan≈ç School = Morikage was often recognised as one of Tan‚Äôy≈´‚Äôs best four pupils in the Kan≈ç School of Painting. Also known as the Kan≈ç School, this art academy was run by a family of artists who crafted a specific style of art considered to be politically ideal for many generations. It was founded during a period where Chinese cultural ideals were popular. However, under the guidance of Kan≈ç Motonobu, it incorporated the Japanese style of ink painting, thereby transforming it into the ‚ÄúKan≈ç style‚Äù. = Style = Initially, when the school was founded, Kan≈ç Masanobu adopted the Chinese painting style favoured by Zen philosophy - depicted by strong brushwork, dominant use of ink and minimal use of pigments. It is thought that Masanobu implemented this style in order to maintain a favourable political standing with the shoguns of that time. As generations passed, this style continued to develop and evolve to include bold use of colour, native Japanese motifs and decorative embellishments to continue to appeal with the wealthy merchants and ruling classes. It was later under Kan≈ç Tan‚Äôy≈´ that the school developed a strict art regime with high academic standards. The Kan≈ç School of Painting became known as the official school of painting in Japan during the Edo period. Due to strong affiliations with the Tokugawa shogunate, Kan≈ç Tan‚Äôy≈´ established an art style that was ‚Äòconsistent with the Tokugawa‚Äôs emphasis on social control‚Äô, holding a strong preference for lucrative production over individual interpretation. Morikage‚Äôs education in Kan≈ç School thus arrived in the form of various academic expectations and rigorous teaching styles. As expected of Kan≈ç students, Morikage trained under Tan‚Äôy≈´ to create an art style that was politically rigid. After spending some time as Tan‚Äôy≈´‚Äôs pupil, the artist came to rebel against the core principles of Kan≈ç School, abandoning strict Kan≈ç laws and traditions to instead pursue spirited creativity. His vision posed a threat to Kan≈ç academicism and ultimately led to Morikage‚Äôs estrangement from Tan‚Äôy≈´. When Morikage was cast out by his master, Kan≈ç Tan‚Äôy≈´, he was appointed as the official painter for the Maeda Clan of the Kaga Province. The artist then became known as the celebrated Kan≈ç school student who left the academy to pursue his desire for individual expression.  Maeda Clan  The Maeda Clan was a powerful family from the Kaga Province that stood second in power to the ruling Tokugawa family. They were allies with the Tokugawa family and maintained a stable relationship all throughout the Edo period. As a result, the Kaga domain also held strong ties with Kan≈ç school‚Äôs artists. It is thus assumed that Morikage‚Äôs connection to the Maeda family was formed when he contributed to work on painting the fusuma (sliding door), Landscape of the Four Seasons, in the clan‚Äôs family temple, Zuiryuji. Today, Landscape of the Four Seasons is a notable artwork that reflects the deep ties between the Maeda Clan and Kan≈ç School. This affiliation also played an important role in the progression of Morikage‚Äôs artistic career. When Morikage relocated to Kaga after being cast out by Tan‚Äôy≈´, he resided in Kanazawa, and formed important relationships with Maeda lords, Imaeda and Obata families, as well as the city magistrate, Kataoka Magobee. It is said that during this time in Kaga, Morikage experienced a major leap in his art career. The artworks Ritual of Racehorse at Kamigamo Shrine and Picking Tea at Uji are believed to be some of Morikage‚Äôs best artistic successes, painted during his stay in Kanazawa.  Themes  The significance of the agricultural industry in Edo Japan is reflected in many of Morikage‚Äôs works. His main source of inspiration comes from the increasingly important role of farmers in cultivating rice, as well as the changing cultural norms of ‚Äúfamily‚Äù and familial relationships. In the Tokugawa period, taxes were levied in rice. For most farmers, rice thus became a symbol of pain and pride, and the ‚Äòsustenance of the Japanese soul‚Äô. As farmers became vital in providing a continuous source of income for the economy, Morikage‚Äôs empathy for them grew and realised itself in the form of capturing the daily life of Japanese farmers. This theme is also resonant in the works of Hanabusa Itch≈ç (1652 - 1724), who similarly departed from the Kan≈ç school and came to be known for painting the ‚Äòcustoms of city life or pastoral villages‚Äô.  Personal Life and Family  The Kan≈ç school highly valued ‚Äòkinship ties‚Äô, as they formed strong, affinal relationships. Kusumi Morikage‚Äôs talent was held in such high regard by his master, Tan‚Äôy≈´, that the artist was eventually married into Tan‚Äôy≈´‚Äôs family. Through this marriage, Morikage was officially recognised as a member of the Kan≈ç family, marking a noteworthy stage in Morikage‚Äôs life. Although these successes also followed his children, it‚Äôs suspected that their later transgressions eventually stripped Morikage of his status as an official painter. = Kiyohara Yukinobu = Morikage‚Äôs daughter, Kiyohara Yukinobu (1643 - 1682), developed an artistic reputation that was well-received and recognised by numerous artists at the time. Yukinobu‚Äôs popularity as an artist was often defined by her elegant style and feminine delicacy in the use of line and colour. Her accomplishments are said to have stemmed from Tan‚Äôy≈´‚Äôs traditional Kan≈ç teachings, and came to be known as the most celebrated female artist in the Kan≈ç School of Painting. During her time as a Kan≈ç pupil, Yukinobu is said to have later eloped with another student in Tan‚Äôy≈´‚Äôs atelier. = Hikojuro = Also a Kan≈ç student who studied under Tan‚Äôy≈´, Hikojuro was a talented painter who was admonished for frequenting houses of ill reputation, such as the Yoshiwara pleasure quarter, and was eventually exiled to Sado Island after showing hostile behaviour towards another student. However, despite this tumultuous reputation, it‚Äôs understood that Hikojuro continued to receive commissions for paintings even while in exile due to his faithful mastery of Kan≈ç teachings and traditions.  Notable Works  Morikage‚Äôs profound and intriguing view of the world was evident in his vivid depictions, including animals rendered with human expressions and plants brought to life with curious and expressive brush strokes. Examining his most notable artworks reveals his ‚Äòrich array of ideas‚Äô and ‚Äòbreadth of his artistic terrain‚Äô. =Family Enjoying the Evening Cool= Family Enjoying the Evening Cool Family Enjoying the Evening Cool is Morikage‚Äôs most notable folding screen painting as it indicates that Morikage depicted happiness in a family structure that was not common at the time. The nuclear family depicted in this painting - a husband, wife and child - reflects major rural familial changes that occurred in the beginning of the seventeenth century. Considered a national treasure, this painting illustrates a peasant family using a combination of fine brushwork, rough brush strokes as well as dilute ink. Additionally, other than visualising a unique take on rural and familial structures in Edo Japan, it is also proposed that Morikage was inspired by a waka poem by the poet Kinoshita Katsutoshi (1569 - 1649), otherwise known by his pen name, Ch≈çsh≈çshi. Another study observes that the painting is constructed with ‚Äòeremitic recluse ideas that would have been learned in a Chinese style education‚Äô, found in motifs such as the gourd. The overall significance of this piece in rendering a peaceful peasant family amidst agricultural crisis prompted its selection for the Tokyo National Museum exhibition in 2001. =Falconry Folding Screens= Falconry Folding Screens is regarded as one of the most important pieces by Kusumi Morikage. The painting largely illustrates falconry, while other birds such as swans and cranes are also hunted ‚Äì depicting a scene that would be common in the Tokugawa family. The realist renditions of the birds and the people on the folding screen appear to be reminiscent of Tan‚Äôy≈´‚Äôs style. While the screen is adorned with Mitsuba-aoi crests of the Tokugawa family, it also depicts various trees, of which plum trees were often associated with the Maeda family‚Äôs crest. The artwork is an important piece as it demonstrates a connection between the Maeda and Tokugawa families. =Farming in the Four Seasons screens= Painted as a pair of six folding screens, Farming in the Four Seasons depicts rural customs in Japan, representing Morikage‚Äôs sympathy for the agricultural industry. Peasants are illustrated to be working in the fields to produce crops over the span of four seasons, Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter. However, the order of the seasons are reversed, showcasing Morikage‚Äôs art style as a personal touch on a classical subject and reveals a vision that set Morikage apart from other artists of his time.

The Wodeyar dynasty ruled the Southern Karnataka region until Indian independence in 1947, when the kingdom was merged with the Union of India. The peak of Mysore's economic power was under Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan in the post-Mughal era of the mid-late 18th century. They embarked on an ambitious program of economic development, aiming to increase the wealth and revenue of Mysore. Under their reign, Mysore overtook Bengal Subah as India's dominant economic power, with highly productive agriculture and textile manufacturing. Under Tipu Sultan, Mysore had India's highest real wages and living standards in the late 18th century, and was comparable to Britain, which in turn had the highest living standards in Europe. Mysore's average per-capita income was an estimated five times higher than subsistence level. Early history The economy of the Kingdom was based on agriculture, due to the majority of its people being villagers. Ownership of land was considered a prestige and people from all trades aimed to own a piece of land, whether they were directly involved in cultivation or not. The agrarian population consisted of landlords (, , ) great and small who tilled the land by employing a number of landless labourers. Payments for services were in kind, usually grain, and even minor cultivators were willing to hire themselves out as labourers if the need arose.Sastri (1955), p297 It was due to the availability of these landless labourers that kings and landlords were able to execute major projects such as palaces, temples, mosques, anicuts (chack dam) and tanks.Chopra et al. (2003), p123, part III Because land was abundant and the population relatively sparse, no rent was charged on land ownership. Instead, landowners paid tax for cultivation, normally amounting up to one half of all produce that was harvested. Tipu Sultan Portrait of Tipu Sultan, 1792 Tipu Sultan, who ruled Mysore from 1782 to 1799 is credited with founding the state trading depots in various locations of his kingdom. In addition, he founded depots in foreign locations such as Karachi, Jeddah and Muscat, where Mysore products could be sold.M.H.Gopal in Kamath 2001, p235 It is to Tipu's credit that French technology was used for the first time in carpentry and smithy. Also, Tipu's rule saw Chinese technology used for sugar production, while technology from Bengal helped improve the sericulture industry.Kamath (2001), p235-236 State factories were established in Kanakapura and Taramandelpeth for producing cannons and gunpowder respectively. The state monopolised the production of essentials such as sugar, salt, iron, pepper, cardamom, betel nut, tobacco and sandalwood, as well as the extraction of incense oil from sandalwood and the mining of silver, gold and precious stones. Sandalwood was exported to China and the Persian gulf countries and sericulture was developed in twenty one centres within the kingdom.Kamath (2001), p236-237 A bond existed between the landlords and his labourers who were called or . In this system, when work ceased to exist in a land, the labourers were free to find employment elsewhere, but were bound to come back whenever required by the landlord. This had a mutual benefit in that it ensured regular employment to the landless and prevented their starvation. Landlords, however, were not required to increase labour rates during times when labour was in demand. Instead, they judiciously gave loans and presents to the labourer during times of need such as marriages and other family ceremonies. These loans bound the labourer to the estate who was not charged with interest on the loan. Instead, the labourer was required to pay back the principal amount only if he wished to free himself permanently from his bond to the landlord and seek employment elsewhere.Chopra et al. (2003), p129-130 Silk industry The Mysore silk industry was first initiated during the reign of Tipu Sultan. Later it was hit by a global depression, and competition from imported silk and rayon. In the second half of the 20th century, it revived and the Mysore State became the top multivoltine silk producer in India. British rule This system changed under the British, when tax payments were in cash, and were used for the maintenance of the army, police and other civil and public establishments. A portion of the tax was transferred to England and called \\"Indian tribute\\".Chopra et al. (2003), p124 Unhappy with the loss of their traditional revenue system and the problems they faced, peasants rose in rebellion in many parts of south India. The construction of anicuts and tanks helped alleviate problems in some areas of the peninsula, though there were variations in living conditions in different regions.Chopra et al. (2003), p129 After 1800, the Cornwallis land reforms came into play. Reade, Munro, Graham and Thackeray were some administrators who improved the economic conditions of the masses.Chopra et al. (2003), p130 However, the home spun textile industry suffered during British rule, due to the manufacturing mills of Manchester, Liverpool and Scotland being more than a match for the traditional hand woven industry, especially spinning and weaving.Kamath (2001), p286 Only weavers who produced the very finest cloth not manufacturable by machines survived the changing economy. Even here, the change in the dressing habits of the people, who adapted to English clothes, had an adverse impact. Only the agricultural and rural masses with their need for coarse cloth sustained the low quality home industry.Chopra et al. (2003), p132 Also, the British economic policies created a class structure consisting of a newly found middle class. This class consisted of four occupational groups; the trading and merchant class consisting of agents, brokers, shopkeepers; the landlords created under the Zamindar system and Janmi system of land tenure; the money lenders; and the white collared lawyers, teachers, civil servants, doctors, journalists and bankers. However, due to a more flexible caste hierarchy, this middle class consisted of a more heterogeneous mix of people from different castes.Chopra et al. (2003), p134 The 19th century brought about the so-called \\"backward classes movement\\", a direct result of the hegemony in employment (in educational and government sectors) by the wealthy few and the loss of jobs across southern India due to the Industrial Revolution in England. This movement was heralded first by the Lingayats followed by the Vokkaligas and the Kurubas.Kamath (2001), p285 The economic revolution in England and the tariff policies of the British caused massive deindustrialization in India, especially in the textile sector. For example, Bangalore was known to have had a flourishing textile industry prior to 1800 and the gunny bag weaving business had been a monopoly of the Goniga people, a state of events that changed significantly when the British began ruling the area. The import of a chemical substitute of saltpetre (potassium nitrate) affected the Uppar community, the traditional makers of saltpetre for use in gunpowder. The import of kerosene affected the Ganiga community who supplied oils. Foreign enamel and crockery industries affected the native pottery business and the mill made blankets replaced the country made kambli.Kamath (2001), p287 This economic fallout led to the formation of community based social welfare organizations such as the Lingayat Vidyavardhakara Sangha in Dharwad in 1883, the Vokkaligara Sanga in Bangalore in 1906 and the Praja Mitra Mandali in Mysore in 1917. The goal of these organizations was to help those within the community to cope better with a new economic situation. Community based youth hostels sprang up to help students seeking education and shelter.Kamath (2001), pp288-289 See also *Economic history of India Notes References  * Category:Kingdom of Mysore Category:Historical economies of Karnataka Category:16th-century economic history Category:17th- century economic history Category:18th-century economic history Category:19th- century economic history Category:Economic history of Karnataka Category:Economic history of India ","title":"Economy of the Kingdom of Mysore"},{"id":"13662141","text":"Nutation refers to the bending movements of stems, roots, leaves and other plant organs caused by differences in growth in different parts of the organ. Circumnutation refers specifically to the circular movements often exhibited by the tips of growing plant stems, caused by repeating cycles of differences in growth around the sides of the elongating stem. Nutational movements are usually distinguished from 'variational' movements caused by temporary differences in the water pressure inside plant cells (turgor). Simple nutation occurs in flat leaves and flower petals, caused by unequal growth of the two sides of the surface. For example, in young leaf buds the outer surface of each leaflet grows faster, causing it to curve over its neighbors and form a compact bud. As the bud expands, growth becomes more rapid on the inner surface of the leaves, causing the bud to open and the leaves to flatten out. Similar inequality of growth, but more sharply localized, leads to the folding and rolling of the leaf in the bud, and to the changing shapes of flower petals. A circumnutating plant stem Circumnutational movements are most obvious in growing seedlings, where the combination of circular movement and upward growth causes the tip to move up in a spiral path. The first detailed analysis of circumnutation was Charles Darwin's The Power of Movement in Plants; he concluded that most plant movements were modifications of circumnutation, but many counterexamples are now known. Circumnutation is not a direct response to gravity or the direction of illumination, but these factors and many physiological processes can influence its direction, timing and amplitude. Although the function of circumnutation in most plants is not known, many twining plants have adapted these movements to help them find and twine around vertical objects such as tree trunks, and to help tendrils find and wind around smaller supports. The growing tips of the vine or tendril initially swings in wide circles that maximize its chance of bumping into an obstacle (a potential support). Once the obstacle is encountered the circles tighten, causing the vine or tendril to wind around the support as it grows.

Fuzhou The Chinese Ry≈´ky≈´- kan (Li√∫qi√∫ gu«én in Chinese pinyin) is located in the city of Fuzhou. Along with the nearby Kaido-kan () and Kokushi-kan (),\\"Rekidai Hoan.\\" p13. it housed visiting dignitaries and scholars en route between Ryukyu and the Chinese capital of Nanjing or Beijing. In addition to officials sent by the kingdom to engage in formal diplomatic matters, Ryukyu regularly sent a small number of students to study a variety of traditional Chinese subjects in the capital, primarily in preparation for careers in the kingdom's government and bureaucracy. Kagoshima The Ry≈´ky≈´-kan in Kagoshima was located below the castle, on the site occupied today by Nagata Middle School and governmental food provisions offices. It played a central role in relations between the Ryukyu Kingdom and the han (feudal domain) to which it was a vassal after 1609, serving a function not unlike a modern-day embassy. Visiting dignitaries lived and worked in the Ry≈´ky≈´-kan, as did students studying classic subjects in preparation for careers in the kingdom's bureaucracy, and a number of Ryukyuan permanent residents of the city. Satsuma's control over the Ryukyuan officials was tight, however; wandering or loitering in the area around the building was forbidden, and guards posted at the entrance checked visitors in and out.Sakai. p401. Ryukyuans could travel around the city, and to other parts of the country, only on official business, and under tight supervision and strict regulations. Similarly strict policies applied to Japanese visiting the institution. The building was destroyed by British naval gunfire during the Bombardment of Kagoshima in 1863.

Career  Sidebottom was a powerful and fearless player ideal for playing at centre half forward or as a ruckman. A versatile forward good in the air and hard in the clinches, he kicked 227 goals while at Swan Districts and 145 goals while in the VFL. He played in the inaugural State of Origin team for Western Australia in 1977 when Western Australia defeated Victoria. In 1984 Sidebottom kicked six goals for Western Australia against Victoria in another famous victory to the Sandgropers. He represented Western Australia fifteen times in state games. He joined St Kilda in 1978 and was their leading goal kicker in 1979. In 1980, Sidebottom, while playing for St Kilda in a match against Hawthorn at Moorabbin was dazed when he was hit across his right eye by a flying beer can. He required medical attention before he was able to continue in the match.\\"'Sidey' downed by beer can\\", Football Times, Messenger Publications:Adelaide. 10 April 1980, p. 14. Despite captaining St Kilda in 1980, his contract was not renewed at the end of the season and he left the club to join Geelong in 1981. Sidebottom entered football folklore when he missed the Geelong team bus to play in the 1981 Preliminary Final against Collingwood due to a breakdown in communications. His team-mate Peter Johnston took his place at the last minute, despite being told earlier he had not been selected, and went on to play despite having half a chicken and a bucket of chips along with a strawberry thickshake for lunch, and having smoked half a pack of Winfield Blue cigarettes on the way to VFL Park. To this day, many Geelong locals call the place where the road from Lara enters the Princes Highway \\"Sidey's Corner\\". This is where Garry and the team bus were supposed to meet up, but never did. In April 1982 he was suspended by Geelong due to an unsatisfactory attitude. Despite suggestions that he may return to play for Swan Districts in the WAFL, he remained in Victoria and signed for , making his debut in July 1982. In 1985 he left Fitzroy to rejoin Swan Districts, where he was their leading goal kicker and won his second best and fairest award, nine years after his previous award, in 1976. Sidebottom returned to Swan Districts as a coach of the reserves side in 2007. He is the older brother of Allan Sidebottom who also played for Swan Districts, St Kilda and Fitzroy. He was inducted into the West Australian Football Hall of Fame in 2011. He died in March 2019 from cancer.

Owned by Fayetteville State University until May 2015, when it was purchased by the Chapel Hill-based public radio broadcaster, WFSS programmed jazz as well as an eclectic mix of formats on the weekend, including bluegrass, Gospel, blues, African and Latin music. Licensed to Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States, it serves the Fayetteville area and twelve surrounding counties. History Former logo In 1977, WFSS began broadcasting at 10 watts, and was operated by students using the station to prepare them for broadcasting careers. Its coverage area was limited to a two-mile radius of campus. In February 1983, power was increased to 100,000 watts, and the station joined NPR. From the beginning the station played jazz but went on to offer a wide variety of programming including blues, reggae and rhythm and blues. Joseph Ross, who came from Monrovia, Liberia, was the station manager from 1977 until the 1980s and again starting in 1995. In March 1993, in order to switch from 89.1 to 91.9 and reduce interference to WECT, WFSS signed off for five days and then came back at 30,000 watts before finally going back to 100,000 watts. On January 20, 2000, a winter storm caused significant damage to broadcasting equipment, and WFSS came back days later at 60 watts. The return to full power happened May 5 after $45,000 in repairs. Funding reductions since 2009 caused the station to lose money, and it soon became apparent that it was no longer viable as a standalone NPR member. On May 13, 2015, Fayetteville State trustees voted to sell WFSS to UNC Chapel Hill for $1.35 million. Though the sale still required Federal Communications Commission approval, WFSS began simulcasting WUNC at 10 a.m. the same day. WUNC's licensee, WUNC Public Radio, LLC, took over WFSS' operations under a local management agreement until the sale closed, during which two WFSS employees were required to stay on site. The sale was consummated on November 24, 2015.

It is considered an early declaration of the rights of working women. The focus is on the main character, Una Golden, and her desire to establish herself in a legitimate occupation while balancing the eventual need for marriage. The story takes place in the early 1900-1920s and takes Una from a small Pennsylvania town to New York. Forced to work due to family illness, Una shows a talent for the traditional male bastion of commercial real estate and, while valued by her company, she struggles to achieve the same status of her male coworkers. On a parallel track, her quest for traditional romance and love is important but her unique role as a working woman, doing a man's job, makes it tough to find an appropriate suitor. Una is on track to marry Walter Babson, who appears to be a good man but lacks the excitement of her eventual husband, Edward Schwirtz. He is a salesman with all the charm necessary to win her heart, but the marriage is doomed from the start. Una eventually determines to divorce him, which is also scandalous for the time. As the book closes, Una emerges triumphant in both her career and her personal life. The novel was published before Lewis achieved any significant fame and provides insights on working women as well as the unique nature (for the time) of having a woman as the lead character.

Early life Born in 1863 in the village GolƒÉ»ôei (Bujor Sat) near T√¢rgu Bujor, in Covurlui County, now Gala»õi county, he studied at the Vasile Alecsandri High School in Gala»õi from 1870 to 1878, and then to the Costache Negruzzi National College in Ia»ôi from 1878 to 1881. He then attended for a year the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Ia»ôi, before transferring to the Military School for Infantry and Cavalry in Bucharest. After graduating in 1884 with the rank of second lieutenant, Grigorescu pursued his studies in France, taking mathematics courses at the Sorbonne. He also attended special artillery and administration courses at the Military School of Saint-Cyr and at the French Ministry of War. In 1903 he was appointed director of the Artillery section at the War Ministry, and from 1907 to 1910 commander of the Artillery Officer School. World War I King Ferdinand I and General Grigorescu reviewing volunteer troops from Transylvania in summer 1917 In 1917, during the Romanian Campaign of World War I, Grigorescu was the commander of the Romanian armies in the Battle of MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti. It was there that he achieved his greatest success, managing to defeat Imperial German troops led by General August von Mackensen. After the battle, Grigorescu was nicknamed the \\"hero of MƒÉrƒÉ»ôe»ôti\\". His victory was praised in Entente countries, and earned the general a sword sent to him by Yoshihito, the Emperor of Japan. He was also a recipient of the Order of Michael the Brave (the highest military decoration of Romania), 3rd Class in October 1916, and 2nd Class in February 1918, as well as the French Legion of Honour, Grand Officer Class.

In the past 25 years the industry has seen continuous growth, and the demand for passenger air travel in particular is forecast to increase from the current level of 236 million passengers to 465 million in 2030. One airport, Heathrow Airport, is amongst the top ten busiest airports in the world. More than half of all passengers travelling by air in the UK currently travel via the six London area airports. Outside London, Manchester Airport is by far the largest and busiest of the remaining airports, acting as a hub for the 20 million or so people who live within a two-hour drive. Regional airports have experienced the most growth in recent years, due to the success of low-cost carrier airlines over the last decade. In 2013 the UK had the third highest number of passengers carried of any country, behind only the United States and China.World Bank Datebase, http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IS.AIR.PSGR 20th century: nationalisation and privatisation Imperial Airways and British Airways Limited were merged and nationalised as British Overseas Airways Corporation in 1939. In the 1970s, aircraft manufacturers were merged and nationalised as British Aerospace. In the 1980s, British Airways and British Aerospace were privatised again by the Thatcher government. 1990s: Advent of no-frills airlines The advent in the mid-1990s of 'no-frills' carriers, such as easyJet and BA's Go, has had a significant impact on air travel in the UK. In 2005 these airlines carried 77.5 million passengers, up from just 4.3 million in 1996.No-Frills Carriers: Revolution or Evolution?, ch.2, pp.4‚Äì5, figs. 2.4 & 2.5 They are responsible for the growth of regional airports, operating from 35 airports in 2006 compared to 10 in 1996, and increasing the choice of international destinations, serving 150 in 2006, compared to 12 a decade earlier.No-Frills Carriers: Revolution or Evolution?, ch.2, p.1, section 2.1 The annual rate of growth in the overall demand for air travel has remained stable since 1975, and current growth is being served by the no-frills airlines at the expense of traditional carriers which, since 2000, have experienced flat or declining traffic levels.No-Frills Carriers: Revolution or Evolution?, ch.2, pp.1‚Äì3 & pp.7‚Äì10No-Frills Carriers: Revolution or Evolution?, ch.3, p.3, section 3.13 & ch.3, p.6, section 3.25 In response, traditional carriers have lowered costs to compete more effectively on price, leading to lower prices on the short haul routes served by this sector, especially in business fares.No-Frills Carriers: Revolution or Evolution?, ch.3, pp.3‚Äì4 & ch.4, pp.12‚Äì13 They have also limited or reduced capacity and in some cases launched no-frills subsidiaries of their own.No-Frills Carriers: Revolution or Evolution?, ch.3, p.4 21st century =Airports= Although the number of airports in the UK runs into hundreds, many are smaller aerodromes dealing with general aviation rather than air transport. In terms of the latter, statistics are collected from 59 main airports, and the largest concentration of services is located in the London and South East of England areas. Heathrow is the largest airport in the country, handling over 67 million terminal passengers in 2006, making it the third busiest airport in the world, and the busiest if measured by the number of international passengers. Nearly a third of all overseas residents visiting the UK enter the country via this airport, which also handles more than a fifth of all overseas visits by UK residents. Heathrow is also a cargo gateway and usually has up to 20 dedicated cargo aircraft using its facilities every day. The largest of which is DHL who also lease cargo aircraft to British Airways for weekend operations. The Economic Contribution of the Aviation Industry in the UK, p33 Gatwick airport, with 34 million terminal passengers, is the second largest in the country, eighth busiest in the world and lays claim to the busiest single runway airport in the world. Between them the five London airports handle nearly 137 million terminal passengers, 59 per cent of the national total.Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Luton and London City. As far as dedicated cargo services are concerned, Stansted and East Midlands airports have both experienced large growth in freight handling over the past decade, and these two airports are the major hubs for express freight operations.The Economic Contribution of the Aviation Industry in the UK, p34 Outside London and the South East, the use of regional airports has increased dramatically in recent years, with the amount of air traffic using these facilities doubling in the period 1995 to 2005.No-Frills Carriers: Revolution or Evolution?, ch.1, p.8, section 1.32 To illustrate this growth, in the five years from 2001 passenger numbers at the regional airports of Exeter Airport, Bristol Airport, and Newcastle Airport increased by 191 per cent, 113 per cent, and 60 per cent respectively. In the same period the largest airports experienced some of the slowest growth, with Heathrow passenger numbers increasing by 11 per cent, and those of Gatwick increasing by less than 10 per cent. Exeter and Bristol airports changed their names to become 'International' airports in 2000 and 1997 respectively. =Airlines= The vast majority of all passengers travelling by air to or from the UK are carried by UK airlines, of which there are around forty, and at the end of 2006 the UK air transport fleet numbered 963 aircraft, flying just under 1.2 million flights and averaging over eight hours of flying daily. Together the two largest airlines as measured by passenger numbers; British Airways and easyJet, account for nearly half of the 127 million passengers flown on UK airlines. In terms of capacity, both available and used, British Airways is again the largest airline, whilst easyJet is pushed into third place by Virgin Atlantic. British Airways passenger flights also account for over 50 per cent of all cargo carried by UK airlines, and when combined with its cargo operations the airline carries over 60 per cent of all cargo carried by UK airlines. Capacity is measured in 'seat kilometres', i.e. the number of seats available/used multiplied by the distance flown. =Passenger travel= Just over a fifth of all terminal passengers are travelling on domestic routes only, whilst half are travelling between the UK and the rest of the European Union (EU). Of the latter, travel between the UK and Spain, France, Germany and Italy account for around half, with Spain almost matching the other three combined in terms of passenger numbers. Outside the EU, the US, the Far East, Switzerland and the Middle East together account for just over half of all passengers flying between the UK and the rest of the world, with the USA exceeding the other three combined in terms of passenger numbers. Air travel is the most popular mode of transport for visitors both to and from the UK. In 2005 it was used for 80 per cent of all visits by UK residents travelling overseas and by 74 per cent of all inbound visits. Just over a quarter of all passengers are travelling on business. The advent of no-frills carriers has had significant a significant effect on passenger travel profiles, with strong growth in business travel from regional airports, and a significant increase in inbound traffic generated for the purposes of non-UK residents visiting friends and relatives based in the UK. Whilst these carriers have been perceived to democratise air travel, providing the opportunity for lower income groups to travel more often, the main result is actually that middle and higher income groups travel more often, and often for shorter trips.No-Frills Carriers: Revolution or Evolution?, Executive Summary pp.4‚Äì6 & ch.4, p.11, section 4.18 The United Kingdom has a low usage for domestic (internal) flights, and after a high in 2005/06, has been in decline. In the year 2010/11 just 18.4 million internal passengers were carried (compared with 1,352 million rail journeys in the same period). Air's share of passengers has reduced significantly on certain key routes. For example, for London to Manchester, rail's market share (rail v. air passenger journeys) rose from 69% in 2008 to 79% in 2010; for Birmingham to Edinburgh, rail's market share rose from 14% in 2008 to 31% in 2010; and for London to Glasgow, rail's market share has risen from 12% in 2008 to 20% in 2010; although air still remains the leader on many London to Scotland journeys. International air travel Future of air transport The current availability of airport capacity has been identified as an important constraint on the ability to meet the increasing demand for air travel. In many cases airport capacity is already fully used in meeting current demand. At Heathrow and Gatwick airports the runways are full for \\"‚Ä¶ virtually the whole day\\". In 2003 the runway at Birmingham airport was expected to reach full capacity by 2009 at the latest, whilst terminal capacity at Edinburgh airport had reached its limit.The Future of Air Transport, para. 2.11‚Äì2.12, p24 Government forecasts that year suggested that by 2030 the number of passengers could rise to between 400mppa (million people per annum) and 600mppa, representing a two- to threefold increase, and a figure of 500mppa by 2030 was regarded by the Government as \\"robust\\".The Future of Air Transport, para.2.8, p23The Future of Air Transport, para. 25, p154 In 2006 the Government reported that at 228mppa the demand for air travel the previous year was in line with the 2003 forecast, but also revised the forecast demand for 2030 downwards to 465mppa as a result of capacity constraints, even taking into account proposed airport developments.Air Transport White Paper Progress Report 2006, paras. 4.4 & 4.11 =Policy= In December 2003 the Government published The Future of Air Transport White Paper which detailed the Government's approach to the future development of air transport. The White Paper does not in itself authorise or preclude any development, but seeks instead to define a \\"national strategic framework for the future development of airport capacity\\" over the next 30 years.The Future of Air Transport, para. 1.6, p17 The principal conclusion is that the two extremes of failing to provide additional airport capacity, and encouraging growth without regard for the wider impacts, are equally unacceptable options. Instead a \\"balanced and measured approach\\" to the future of air transport in the UK is adopted.The Future of Air Transport, para. 2.172.18, p26 The Government's approach is designed to cater for the forecast growth in demand, thus supporting economic prosperity nationally and enabling ordinary people to travel at reasonable cost, whilst at the same time managing and mitigating the environmental impacts of aviation and ensuring that the costs associated with them are reflected in the price of air travel (see detailed sections below).The Future of Air Transport, Executive Summary Conclusions & para. 2.18, p26 In December 2006 the Government published the Air Transport White Paper Progress Report 2006 to report on progress made in \\"‚Ä¶ delivering a sustainable future for aviation.\\"Air Transport White Paper Progress Report 2006 The report re- iterates the Government's commitment to the strategy defined in the original White Paper, stating that it \\"‚Ä¶ strikes the right balance between economic, social and environmental goals.\\"Air Transport White Paper Progress Report 2006, para. 1.2 In 2010 the new Coalition Government abandoned the approach taken in the White Paper and ruled out further airport expansion of London's three main airports (Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted). On 31 October 2011 at the Airport Operators Association, the Labour Party's Shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle announced that the Party had abandoned its support for a third runway at Heathrow Airport but said that the Government must also drop its moratorium on new airport capacity in the South East. On 2 November 2011 the Thames Hub proposal was launched by Lord Foster. This attempts to integrate several infrastructure components (flood barrier, hydroelectric generation, rail lines) and includes plans for one of the World's largest airports. It would be capable of handling 150 million passengers a year, have 4 runways and be built on a platform in the Hoo Peninsula in Kent. =Environmental impact= Whilst carbon emissions from all UK activities other than aviation had declined by 9 per cent in the 10 years between 1990 and 2000, carbon emissions from aviation activities doubled in the same period.Predict and decide - Aviation, climate change and UK policy, p4 Air transport in the UK accounted for 6.3 per cent of all UK carbon emissions in 2006. When the radiative forcing impact of other emissions are taken into account the total impact of emissions attributable to aviation is estimated to be twice that of its carbon emissions alone.Air Transport White Paper Progress Report 2006, para. 2.25 Although the Government has committed to reducing total UK carbon emissions by 80 per cent from existing levels by 2050, its policy is based on the use of \\"‚Ä¶ economic instruments to ensure that growing industries are catered for within a reducing total.\\"The Future of Air Transport, paras. 3.36 & 3.37, pp39 & 40 Even if this reduction in total carbon emissions is achieved, research published in February 2006 concluded that aviation could account for between 24 per cent and 50 per cent of the UK's carbon budget by 2050. There is some debate about whether the government's target of a 60% reduction, which would stabilise carbon emissions at 550ppmv, is sufficient to mitigate against climate change, and a more stringent target of 450ppmv has been suggested. Under this scenario aviation would account for between 50 and 100 per cent of the UK's carbon budget by 2050. The strategy adopted in the White Paper seeks to mitigate the global impact of air transport primarily through emissions trading schemes. Although the Kyoto Protocol implemented emissions trading as a means to reduce emissions at national levels, the global nature of air transport means that international (but not domestic) air travel is excluded from this mechanism. The Government is seeking to redress this through the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), but progress is slow. In the meantime efforts are being made to include aviation in the EU Emission Trading Scheme with an original target to implement this by 2008.The Future of Air Transport, paras. 3.39‚Äì3.40, p.40 In 2006 the Government re-affirmed this policy as the best approach for addressing the climate change impacts of aviation, and current proposals aim at accomplishing this for all flights within the EU by 2011, with the scheme being extended to include all flights to and from the EU the following year.Air Transport White Paper Progress Report 2006, paras 2.5 ‚Äì 2.11 Critics of the Government's policy advocate addressing climate change impacts by constraining demand for air travel. The study Predict and Decide - Aviation, climate change and UK policy concludes that the Government should seek an alternative aviation policy based on managing demand rather than providing for it.Predict and decide - Aviation, climate change and UK policy, p96, section 11.9 This would be accomplished via a strategy that presumes \\"‚Ä¶ against the expansion of UK airport capacity\\" and restrains demand by the use of economic instruments to price air travel less attractively. Other studies point to a significant contribution to aviation's climate change emissions by the social phenomenon hypermobility, and the increasing prevalence of hypermobility among UK and global citizens.G√∂ssling S, Ceron JP, Dubois G, Hall CM, G√∂ssling S, Upham P, Earthscan L (2009).

In: Climate Change and Aviation: Issues, Challenges and Solutions (), Earthscan, London. Key to the concerns expressed in these studies are: that vast distances are easily travelled in a relatively short time, entailing substantial greenhouse gas emissions; that these emissions are made at- altitude where they have much greater climate consequences than emissions made at ground-level; and that social pressuresSee also:\\"The Bill,\\" by Peter Wedel, distributed by GermanWatch. and marketing programs such as frequent flyer miles programs that both encourage a growing amount of travel and means to go. Climate scientist Kevin Anderson of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research demonstrated in 2009 that continued annual growth in UK air travel at the usual seven percent until 2012 and at three percent thereafter will lead to such travel consuming 70 percent of the UK's total planned national carbon emissions by 2030.Anderson, K. (2008, 17 June). Reframing climate change: from long-term targets to emission pathways (esp. slide 24 onward).Anderson K, Bows A (2008). Reframing the climate change challenge in light of post-2000 emission trends. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences (366:1882, p.3863-3882). In that less-than-business-as-usual scenario, UK air travel emissions would increase from 11 MT in 2006, to 17 MT in 2012, and 28 MT in 2030. His contention is that the consequences of not promptly reducing the demand or supply for air travel in the UK and elsewhere will result in severe consequences for society and the ecosystems upon which humanity depends.Anderson, K.

The station is owned by Jeffrey Andrulonis' Andrulonis Media. WFAY serves the Fayetteville area. WFAY is the flagship station of the Carolina Country network, a country music network covering portions of North and South Carolina, and having been in Andrulonis's hands on and off since 1995, it is the flagship of the entire Andrulonis Media portfolio. History WFAI signed on the air in 1947. At one time, WFAI was a CBS Radio affiliate carrying Arthur Godfrey, Art Linkletter and Ma Perkins. Jack Lee bought WFAI in 1960, and his \\"Open Mike\\" may have been the first talk show in Fayetteville. Danny Highsmith hosted \\"Talk Back\\" in the 1970s. \\"Talk Back\\" aired from 10‚Äì11 a.m. Monday to Friday. Lee had worked with Joy Pyne in Delaware, and her show was on WFAI at one time.Michael Futch, \\"Recalling the First Call-in,\\" The Fayetteville Observer, March 18, 2001. Curt Nunnery hosted \\"Curt's Coffee Club\\" from 1960 to 1991, later moving the show to WFLB.Michael Futch, \\"Familiar Sound Back on Radio,\\" The Fayetteville Observer February 16, 1997. WFAI was owned by Beasley Broadcasting in late 1970s and early 1980s. In the 1970s, WFAI carried ABC Radio News from the American Entertainment Radio Network. The radio station slogan as a country station was \\"Fayetteville's Friend WFAI.\\" Other slogans used were \\"WFAI Plays Favorites\\" coming out of ABC news at the bottom of the hour and the Station ID was \\"A Proud Part of the Beasley Broadcast Group, WFAI Fayetteville, North Carolina\\". The line up on WFAI in the mid- to late-1970s was Rudy Hickman 6-10A.M., Smoky King 10A.M.-2P.M., Terry Jordan 2-6P.M., and Scott Matthews 6P.M. to midnight. Also on the air was Ted Harris, who had come from WFNC; Mike Edwards, who had come from WHPY Clayton; and overnights Midnight-6 was Mike Huffman. Bob Brandon, who was in high school, went under the name Bob Clark at that time, and worked weekends. He went on to WFNC Fayetteville, and later, WSOC-FM in Charlotte. Bob Lee Chilcote handled Sunday mornings. Such programs as Fort Bragg Public Affairs, FCCYC, and Country Crossroads aired. Using the name \\"Bob Lee\\" and his show was \\"Turn Your Radio On\\" from 9‚Äì10:30 a.m., Bob played southern gospel music and used the Ray Stevens' song \\"Turn your Radio On\\" as the theme. Woody Gosnell usually handled the Sunday afternoons from Noon‚Äì6. One of the Sunday standards was Terry Jordan's \\"At the Console\\" in which he played organ music both church-oriented and classical, recorded at various churches in the Fayetteville area. \\"At the Console\\" aired from 10:30‚Äì11 a.m. From 11‚Äìnoon a church service aired live. In the area of local news, the standard bearer was Johnnie Joyce, having come over from WFBS Spring Lake, whose newscasts aired from 5:30 to 9:30 a.m. each day Monday to Friday and also in the afternoons, with updates as needed. Sue Morrison, a graduate of the Radio TV program at CCTI, now CCCC in Sanford, provided those news updates in the late 1970s. In the 1970s WFAI also carried Winston Cup NASCAR races,now known as Sprint Nextel racing, which at that time was provided by MRN the Motoring Racing Network.Dr. Anthony Ross Harrington, 1977 Intern from CCTI Sanford at WFAI Former BPT Instructor at CCCC Triton High School 1988-1999 and Lead History Instructor at CCCC 1999-2013 retired. In 1980, WFAI became a Mutual Broadcasting System affiliate of the Larry King Show, which aired from midnight to 5 a.m. WFAI management cancelled the show after numerous complaints from its country listening audience. As a country station, WFAI was a reporting station for Billboard magazine and had been awarded numerous platinum and gold records for its contribution to country music. In summer of 1981, WFAI hosted a free country concert. The top act was Ronnie McDowell. The opening act was Alabama. In the early 1980s the on-air staff included Tim Williams, Mike Kirchen, Mike Hankey. Keith Cramer [Keith Eckhardt], worked overnights until he graduated from Westover Sr. High. On March 1, 1991, WFAI changed from music of the big band era to traditional gospel music targeting African-American listeners. Station owners Henry Hoot and Rev. Gardner Altman also owned WFLB, which played more contemporary gospel music. WFAI would play Shirley Caesar, Willie Neal Johnson and The Gospel Keynotes, and the Rev. James Cleveland, while WFLB would play The Kingsmen, Chuck Wagon Gang and The Bishops. Station manager Rosa \\"Lady Gospel\\" Freeman said the station's announcers would be Don Reid, Bob Gay, Omega Sutton, Danny Davis and Dwayne Collins, and that WFAI would also have area ministers.David Bourne, \\"WFAI-AM Goes Gospel on Friday,\\" The Fayetteville Observer, February 28, 1991. Jeff Andrulonis and Colonial Radio Group bought WFAI from Altman in 1995 and changed it to news/talk. At the time, it had Spanish language broadcasts at night.Michael Futch,\\"Radio Station to Go Spanish,\\" The Fayetteville Observer, June 22, 2002.

On February 22, 2016, as it became clear that Andrulonis's Twin Tiers efforts had failed to make a significant impact (much less corner the market) against the established and stronger-signaled competition there, he announced he was buying back WFAY and WFBX as the company returned its focus to the Carolinas. He also announced that, as many other AM radio stations were doing at the time, both stations would be getting FM translators to boost their coverage. Colonial resumed operating the stations under a local marketing agreement March 1.Paul Woolverton, \\"Fayetteville-area sports radio stations are being sold,\\" The Fayetteville Observer, February 23, 2016 In addition to ESPN Radio programming, WFAY broadcasts ECU football and basketball. Jeff Andrulonis announced on October 4, 2016 that the station would not broadcast the game between the Pirates and the South Florida Bulls the following Saturday. This was in response to a protest made by members of the school's marching band prior to the UCF game the previous Saturday to address racial justice and police brutality. On October 8, 2016 WFAY went silent. On November 22, 2016, WFAY returned to the air with ESPN sports, branded as \\"ESPN Fayetteville\\". The purchase by Colonial Media and Entertainment, at a price of $771,641, was consummated on December 1, 2016.

Licensed to Lillington, North Carolina, United States, it serves the Fayetteville area. The station is currently owned by Estuardo Valdemar Rodriguez.  History  Bob Etheridge owned WLLN when it signed on Monday, February 12, 1979 at 11:00 AM with \\"Music Box Dancer\\" by Frank Mills as the only radio station in Lillington. The station operated a two-tower directional antenna array with 2500 watts of daytime power and 500 watts pre-sunrise authority. The station manager of WLLN was Cary Stedman, who was assisted by his father-in-law, Lincoln Faulk, who had been the first station manager of WCKB in Dunn in 1946. The station played (adult contemporary music) until August 4, 1980, when the station changed format to (country music). The new station manager was Charles Fowler, who had been a top salesman of commercial advertising at WPYB in Benson. Fowler brought with him the Good Morning Charlie Show. This was a buy and sell show, somewhat like a swap shop program. In the middle of this country music format, WLLN added in the summer of 1984 a Beach Music Program on the third Friday of each month. It was hosted by Selby Davis, who had done this program at WQTI in Dunn. It was entitled \\"At the Beach\\". In 1984, the station increased power to 5000 watts with a three-tower directional antenna array. On March 18, 1985, the station changed format to (top 40 music) with a heavy emphasis on music of the 50s, 60s, and 70s. On the weekends gospel music could be heard on Sundays from sign-on to 12 noon. Fowler left WLLN in October 1987 to purchase WCKB in Dunn, which he owns as of this writing in May 2010. There have been many air personalities at WLLN, some of which were: Dr. Anthony Harrington, Cary Stedman, Mike Dennis, Steve Norris, Abby Norris, Clay McCauley, Frankie Bellflower, Danny Phair, Gail Brown, Lottie Squires, Bill Sellers (who was also known as \\"Wagon Wheel Willie\\" on AFN Radio Korea), Kim Carpenter, Sherri James, Bill Blalock, Bob Klug, Lisa Herne, Gibson Smith, Kevin Johnson, Richard Longnecker, Lana Gardner, Dot Hood, Marc Parker, Larry Rickard and Mike Coats. Butch Halpin brought Beach Music back to WLLN in August 1989 with The Carolina Sounds Beach Show. That show was on WLLN for 18 months until it moved to another radio station. Al Anders handled Sunday morning gospel, as he had done at WCKB. In 1988, WLLN did a collaborative broadcast with WBLA in Elizabethtown and WBZB in Selma. This continued until WLLN was sold in 1991.Dr. Anthony Harrington, graduate of CCTI Radio Television Curriculum 1977, now known as CCCC Broadcast Production Technology, and Lead History Instructor at CCCC in Sanford, NC (1999-2013 retired). Etheridge admitted he never made a lot of money with the station, but he felt it provided a service to the citizens of central Harnett County and to the county seat of Lillington. In 1991, he sold WLLN to Christian Purities Fellowship, Inc., which was owned by O.T. Spence, who also was the President of Heritage Bible College in Dunn, NC. Spence later sold the station to Rodriguez, who came to the United States in 1961 and also owned a radio station in his native Peru. In October 1999, WLLN became Radio La Grande, which was one of three Spanish-language radio stations in North Carolina in July 2000. In addition to Harnett County, the 5000-watt station covered Lee, Johnston and Sampson Counties and part of Cumberland. Music included salsa, bachata, cumbia and Tejano music. Programming also included news, information and sports.

She was used by the Navy to patrol navigable waterways of the Confederacy to prevent the South from trading with other countries. On August 13, 1864 at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the Navy purchased Columbia, a wooden-hulled screw steamer built there earlier that year. The Navy renamed her Berberry, and she was placed in commission at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on September 12, 1864, Acting Ensign Milton Griffith in command. Assigned to the North Atlantic Blockade After about a fortnight‚Äôs towing duty that took her to Fort Monroe and Baltimore, Maryland, Berberry departed Philadelphia on September 29 and reached Beaufort, North Carolina, on October 1 for duty in the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. Two days later, she took station off the New Inlet entrance to North Carolina‚Äôs Cape Fear River where she labored to help tighten the blockade of Wilmington, North Carolina. Chasing after blockade runners in the dark of night At 03:00 on the morning of October 4, while patrolling east of Mount Light, the tug observed a steamer heading for New Inlet and gave chase. Although she fired two shots at the stranger, that blockade runner managed to cross Berberry's bow and escaped into New Inlet. At 21:45 on the following evening, a lookout in the tug sighted a long, low, two stack steamer standing out to sea from New Inlet. Later that night, Griffith reported that the blockade runner \\"...stood for us within 400 yards; then kept off to the southward.\\" Berberry immediately attempted to cut off the steamer by getting between her and the bar. Meanwhile, she opened fire on the stranger and sent up \\"...rockets in the direction in which she was steering.\\" Despite the fact that fellow blockaders and joined the chase, the runner's speed enabled her to steam out of sight of her pursuers; and she apparently made her way safely to the open sea. Attempting to free run-aground Aster, Berberry gets stuck Shortly after midnight on October 8, while Berberry was on station northeast of Mound Light, observers reported an approaching boat. Griffith hailed the stranger and ordered her alongside. She proved to be from the tug ‚Äî that had run aground on Caroline Shoals while chasing a blockade runner that was attempting to enter New Inlet ‚Äî and requested assistance. Berberry quickly set a course for New Inlet Bar where she took a hawser from Aster and attempted to pull the stranded tug free. However, the hawser parted without Asters budging; and Berberry made several more unsuccessful attempts before the falling tide compelled her to abandon the effort. She then tried to go alongside Aster so that she might rescue the tug's crew. It took Berberry some 20 minutes of difficult maneuvering to work into a position suitable for the transfer. She then took on board everyone from Aster with the exception of that vessel's captain, executive officer, and pilot who all remained behind to destroy their ship lest she fall into enemy hands. During the operation, Berberry thumped \\"...heavily on the bottom....\\" Then, as she moved away from Aster, Berberry ran over the hawser that became entangled with her propeller. Griffith then had his men raise all the awnings, blankets, and other large pieces of cloth as jury-rigged \\"...sails to drift the Berberry off shore.\\" Meanwhile, he burned Coston signal lights to call for help. Niphon comes to the rescue of Berberry while Aster burns When he saw Berberrys signal, Niphons commanding officer was preparing to launch boats to board and to destroy the stranded blockade running steamer Annie that Aster had been chasing. He immediately abandoned that project and headed for Berberry to render aid. About this time, Aster burst into flame, illuminating both Berberry and Niphon and enabling Confederate shore batteries to open fire on both Union ships. Despite the heavy barrage, Niphon pressed on with her rescue operations and pulled Berberry to safety. Unfortunately, the tug was leaking badly from striking the bottom and required repairs at the Norfolk Navy Yard. Continued North Carolina operations Ready to resume action late in November, Berberry departed Hampton Roads on the 23rd and headed back to waters off New Inlet. She arrived there on the morning of the 26th and, that night, her guns persuaded an unidentified blockade runner to give up her attempt to escape to sea and to retire to Wilmington, North Carolina. Early in December, illness compelled Ens. Griffith to request relief and Ens. Robert W. Browntree took command of the tug on December 4. On the 10th, a severe storm battered the tug and forced her to return to Beaufort for repairs. Mid-month found Berberry still at Beaufort in the Sounds of North Carolina, and she served there through the end of the year. On January 3, 1865, Acting Ens. Peter C. Asserson took command of the tug that then returned to blockade duty off New Inlet. She operated there until February 26. She then returned to Beaufort and operated in the sounds until after the collapse of the Confederacy. The tug left North Carolina's inland waters on 29 May and reached Hampton Roads the next day. Post-war decommissioning and sale She sailed north on June 1 and reached New York on the 2nd. Berberry was decommissioned at the New York Navy Yard on June 10. Sold at public auction there on July 12, she was redocumented as Rescue on July 31. The tug served through the turn of the century and was sold to a foreign purchaser in 1902.

They provide evidence of the discursive entanglements between National socialist in Germany and the USSR, demonstrate what one regime wrote about the other, and show how the propaganda methods and narratives of one side influenced the other. The narrative of the travelogue and the setup of the Anti- Komintern as an association clearly point to Soviet examples.  \\"Jewish Bolshevism\\" and ‚ÄúJewish World Conspiracy‚Äù  Between the summer of 1939 and the spring of 1941, when the Third Reich and the USSR agreed to an uneasy truce, the anti- Bolshevik propaganda was halted. Joseph Goebbels officially dissolved the Anti-Comintern and concentrated the efforts of his ministry on the British enemy. This had to change with the German aggression against the USSR. After the attack on the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, Goebbels noted in his diary that it was time to play the ‚Äúanti-Bolshevik record‚Äù once again. The propaganda ministry had to rally the concerned German public for the war against the USSR. It soon became apparent that the wartime propaganda was more than a mere repeat of the anti-Soviet campaign of the late 1930s. Nazi Germany propaganda again emphasized the global Jewish conspiracy against the Germanation, as the anti-Bolshevik rhetoric became a part of a discourse that served to legitimize the World War and the Holocaust.

Human euthanasia policies have also been developed by a variety of NGOs, most notably medical associations and advocacy organizations. , active human euthanasia is legal in the Netherlands, Belgium, Colombia, Luxembourg, Western Australia and Canada. Assisted suicide is legal in Switzerland, Germany, the Australian state of Victoria and in the U.S. states of Washington, Oregon, Colorado, Hawaii, Vermont, Maine, New Jersey, California, and in the District of Columbia. Euthanasia law by country =Argentina= On 9 May 2012, the Argentine Senate turned into law a project that enables to reject treatments that artificially prolong the life of patients with terminal or irreversible symptoms. The consent may be given by the patient or, if not in a position to do so, their relatives or legal representatives. It was promulgated on 24 May 2012 as \\"Law 26,742\\". =Australia= The Australian state of Victoria has a law allowing physician-assisted suicide which came into effect in June 2019, with Western Australia passing a similar law in December 2019. Physician- assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia is illegal in all other Australian states and territories. Although rare, charges have been laid for 'aiding and abetting' the suicide of others.. It was once legal in the Northern Territory, by the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995. In 1997, the Australian Federal Government overrode the Northern Territory legislation through the introduction of the Euthanasia Laws Act 1997. Unlike the states, legislation in the Northern Territory is not guaranteed by the Australian constitution. During the brief period in which euthanasia was legal in the Northern Territory, Dr. Philip Nitschke helped three people end their lives through assisted suicide using his Deliverance machine. Organizations such as Exit International want the government to bring back euthanasia rights to Australia. Exit made TV commercials which were banned before they made it to air in September 2010. =Belgium= The Belgian parliament legalised euthanasia on 28 May 2002. A survey published in 2010 reported that those who died from euthanasia (compared with other deaths) were more often younger, male, cancer patients and more often died in their homes. In almost all cases, unbearable physical suffering were reported. Euthanasia for nonterminal patients was rare. There have been about 1,400 cases a year since the law was introduced, and a record 1,807 cases were recorded in 2013. In December 2003, the Belgian Senate voted in favour of extending its euthanasia law to terminally ill children. Conditions imposed on children seeking euthanasia are that \\"the patient must be conscious of their decision and understand the meaning of euthanasia\\", \\"the request must have been approved by the child's parents and medical team\\", \\"their illness must be terminal\\" and \\"they must be in great pain, with no available treatment to alleviate their distress\\". A psychologist must also determine the patient's maturity to make the decision. The amendment emphasizes that the patient's request be voluntary. The first minor to be euthanized under these new regulations occurred in September 2016. In September 2014, the Federal Euthanasia Commission gave convicted rapist and murderer Frank Van Den Bleeken the right to assisted suicide. Van Den Bleeken had served decades in prison for a 1989 crime and no longer wished to live. Over a dozen other inmates filed similar petitions. In January 2015, the Justice Ministry acknowledged that Van Den Bleeken's doctors recommended against euthanasia and that alternative psychological care would be sought for him. In late 2014, a doctor administered a lethal dose of drugs to a patient after struggling with mental illness for years, upon the patient own request. Quote: \\"Belgium is one of five countries that allow doctors to kill patients at their request, and one of two, along with the Netherlands, that grant the procedure for people with mental illness. The idea is that those with a psychiatric illness should be afforded the same rights as those suffering from a physical one.\\" In January 2020, the assizes court in Ghent acquitted three doctors of murder charges for an euthanasia in 2010. =Canada= Voluntary active euthanasia, called \\"physician assisted dying\\", is legal in Canada for all people over the age of 18 who have a terminal illness that has progressed to the point where natural death is \\"reasonably foreseeable.\\" To prevent suicide tourism, only people eligible to claim Canadian health insurance may use it. Legalization of the practice came in 2015/2016 as a result of a series of Supreme Court rulings striking down Canada's ban on medically assisted suicide. Below is a timeline of events: On 6 February 2015, the Supreme Court of Canada unanimously ruled in Carter v Canada (AG) that Canadian adults who are mentally competent and suffering intolerably and permanently have the right to a doctor's help in dying. The court however suspended its ruling for 12 months to give the government an opportunity to write legislation and draft new laws and policies around assisted dying.Carter v. Canada (Attorney General), 2015 SCC 5, online at: http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc- csc/en/item/14637/index.do In January 2016 the court granted an additional 4-month extension to its ruling suspension to allow time for the newly elected Liberal government to consult with Canadians on drafting a law to comply with the ruling. As an interim measure, it also ruled that provincial courts can now begin approving applications for euthanasia until the new law passes. A parliamentary committee report tasked with studying the issue in light of the Supreme Court of Canada's ruling recommended that anyone experiencing \\"intolerable suffering\\" should be able to seek a doctor's help to die. On 14 April 2016, Canada's federal Liberal government introduced legislation to legalize assisted dying under more restrictive conditions than recommended by the committee, allowing access to only those with terminal illnesses for whom death is \\"reasonably foreseeable\\". The British Columbia Civil Liberties Association argues that the government's assisted dying law is unconstitutional, because it limits access to only those whose death is \\"reasonably foreseeable\\", rather than provide access to anybody suffering from a \\"grievous and irremediable\\" condition, the definition used by the Supreme Court of Canada in their court ruling that the BCCLA argues would include non- terminal conditions. The bill received considerable multi-partisan opposition within the Senate, where it was criticized as being drafted too quickly, and being too restrictive compared with the Supreme Court decision. As a result, the Senate made a series of amendments to the bill. The House of Commons accepted all of the amendments made by the Senate except one, which removed the requirement that death be \\"reasonably foreseeable.\\" On 17 June 2016, a bill to legally allow assisted suicide within Canada became law after it passed both houses of the Parliament of Canada and received Royal Assent. =Chile= Active euthanasia or assisted suicide are not legal in Chile. Passive euthanasia, however, is legal. Since 2012, the regulation of patients' rights creates the right to informed consent, which allows accepting or refusing any medical treatment. Patients can refuse treatment when they are terminal. Currently in 2019, a bill to allow active euthanasia and assisted suicide is being discussed by the congress. =Colombia= In a 6‚Äì3 decision, Colombia's Constitutional Court ruled in 1997 that \\"no person can be held criminally responsible for taking the life of a terminally ill patient who has given clear authorization to do so,\\" according to the Washington Post. The court defined \\"terminally ill\\" person as those with diseases such as \\"cancer, AIDS, and kidney or liver failure if they are terminal and the cause of extreme suffering,\\" the Post reported. The ruling specifically refused to authorize euthanasia for people with degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, or Lou Gehrig's disease. On 15 December 2014, the Constitutional Court had given the Ministry of Health and Social Protection 30 days to publish guidelines for the healthcare sector to use in order to guarantee terminated ill patients, with the wish to undergo euthanasia, their right to a dignified death. =Denmark= Parliament has assigned ethics panels over the years that have advised against legalisation each time however it is still not specifically outlawed and a study published in 2003 showed 41% of deaths under medical supervision involved doctors taking \\"end-of-life\\" decisions to help ease their patients' suffering before death (about 1% of which were via prescription drugs). =Finland= Active euthanasia is not legal in Finland. Passive euthanasia, however, is legal. =France= In July 2013, French President Fran√ßois Hollande stated his personal support for decriminalisation of voluntary euthanasia in France, which had been one of his presidential campaign promises (\\"introduction of the right to die with dignity\\"), despite objections from France's National Consultative Ethics Committee/ Comit√© national consultatif d'√©thique, which alleged \\"abuses\\" in adjacent jurisdictions that have decriminalised and regulated either voluntary euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide (Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg). More socially conservative members of the Catholic Church and other major religious groups in France had announced that after expressing an opposition to the introduction of same-sex marriage in France, their next target may be the possible decriminalisation of voluntary euthanasia. In January 2016 both houses of France's parliament approved a measure that, while stopping short of euthanasia, would allow doctors to keep terminal patients sedated until death. =Germany= Passive euthanasia is legal in Germany if the patient has requested it. On 17 May 2014 the Federal Constitutional Court legalized passive euthanasia by means of the withdrawal of life support to patients who request euthanasia. Forms of active euthanasia, including the lethal compound administration, are illegal. On 6 November 2015, the German Parliament passed a bill incriminating assisted suicide if it is done in a business-like manner. \\"Business-like\\" was meant by the legislator to include any recurrent assistance. Consequently, it typically included physicians. There did not need to be an intention to gain benefits. On 2 March 2017, the Federal Administrative Court ruled that, in extreme circumstances, it was illegal that an agency denied access to life-ending substances. The relevant legal basis must be interpreted in accordance with the fundamental right to personal self-determination. On 7 May 2019, the Federal Court of Justice, changing its previous judicature from 1984, confirmed that doctors have no obligation to stop the death of a person who, pursuant to a valid autonomous decision, attempts suicide. On 26 February 2020, the Federal Constitutional Court ruled the provision which penalized assisted suicide services unconstitutional and thus void. The provision violated the fundamental right to personal self-determination. =India= Passive euthanasia is legal in India. On 7 March 2018 the Supreme Court of India legalised passive euthanasia by means of the withdrawal of life support to patients in a permanent vegetative state. Forms of active euthanasia, including the administration of lethal compounds, are illegal. =Ireland= In Ireland, it is illegal for a doctor (or anyone) to actively contribute to someone's death. It is not, however, illegal to remove life support and other treatment (the \\"right to die\\") should a person (or their next of kin) request it. A September 2010 Irish Times poll showed that a majority, 57% of adults, believed that doctor-assisted suicide should be legal for terminally ill patients who request it. Doctors can stop giving a patient life sustaining treatments such as ventilators, feeding tube etc. after being sedated, allowing the patient to die peacefully in their sleep.This only occurs in certain circumstances. On 7 October 2020 the Dying with Dignity Bill passed its second reading and a delaying amendment was defeated, moving Ireland closer towards the legalisation of assisted dying. =Israel= The Israeli Penal Law forbids causing the death of another and specifically forbids shortening the life of another. Active euthanasia is forbidden by both Israeli law and Jewish law. Passive euthanasia is forbidden by Jewish law but has been accepted in some cases under Israeli law. In 2005, proposals were put forward to allow passive euthanasia to be administered using a switch mechanism similar to Sabbath clocks. In 2006, the Steinberg Commission was set up to look into whether life and death issues could be rethought in the context of Jewish law, which suggested that hospitals could set up committees to determine whether patients would be given passive euthanasia. =Japan= The Japanese government has no official laws on the status of euthanasia and the Supreme Court of Japan has never ruled on the matter. Rather, to date, Japan's euthanasia policy has been decided by two local court cases, one in Nagoya in 1962, and another after an incident at Tokai University in 1995. The first case involved (i.e., allowing a patient to die by turning off life support) and the latter case involved (e.g., through injection). The judgments in these cases set forth a legal framework and a set of conditions within which both passive and active euthanasia could be legal. Nevertheless, in both of these particular cases the doctors were found guilty of violating these conditions when taking the lives of their patients. Further, because the findings of these courts have yet to be upheld at the national level, these precedents are not necessarily binding. Nevertheless, at present, there is a tentative legal framework for implementing euthanasia in Japan. In the case of passive euthanasia, three conditions must be met: # the patient must be suffering from an incurable disease, and in the final stages of the disease from which he/she is unlikely to make a recovery; # the patient must give express consent to stopping treatment, and this consent must be obtained and preserved prior to death. If the patient is not able to give clear consent, their consent may be determined from a pre-written document such as a living will or the testimony of the family; # the patient may be passively euthanized by stopping medical treatment, chemotherapy, dialysis, artificial respiration, blood transfusion, IV drip, etc. For active euthanasia, four conditions must be met: # the patient must be suffering from unbearable physical pain; # death must be inevitable and drawing near; # the patient must give consent. (Unlike passive euthanasia, living wills and family consent will not suffice.) # the physician must have (ineffectively) exhausted all other measures of pain relief. The problems that arose from this, in addition to the problem faced by many other families in the country, has led to the creation of \\"bioethics SWAT teams\\". These teams will be made available to the families of terminally ill patients in order to help them, along with the doctors, come to a decision based on the personal facts of the case. Though in its early stages and relying on \\"subsidies from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare\\" there are plans to create a nonprofit organization to \\"allow this effort to continue.\\" =Latvia= Euthanasia is not legal in Latvia. However a doctor may refuse further treatment of a patient if they believe it is the best course of action.http://www.vvc.gov.lv/export/sites/default/docs/LRTA/Citi/Medical_Treatment_Law.pdf =Lithuania= Euthanasia is not legal in Lithuania.However, as of 2016 a draft of a law about the right to die has been produced. =Luxembourg= The country's parliament passed a bill legalizing euthanasia on 20 February 2008 in the first reading with 30 of 59 votes in favour. On 19 March 2009, the bill passed the second reading, making Luxembourg the third European Union country, after the Netherlands and Belgium, to decriminalise euthanasia. Terminally ill patients will have the option of euthanasia after receiving the approval of two doctors and a panel of experts. =Mexico= In Mexico, active euthanasia is illegal but since 7 January 2008 the law allows the terminally ill ‚Äîor closest relatives, if unconscious‚Äî to refuse medication or further medical treatment to extend life (also known as passive euthanasia) in Mexico City, in the central state of Aguascalientes (since 6 April 2009) and, since 1 September 2009, in the Western state of Michoac√°n. A similar law extending the same provisions at the national level has been approved by the senate and an initiative decriminalizing active euthanasia has entered the same legislative chamber on 13 April 2007. =Netherlands= In the 1973 \\"Postma case\\" a physician was convicted for having facilitated the death of her mother following repeated explicit requests for euthanasia. While upholding the conviction, the court's judgment set out criteria when a doctor would not be required to keep a patient alive contrary to their will. This set of criteria was formalized in the course of a number of court cases during the 1980s. In 2001, the Netherlands passed a law legalizing euthanasia including physician- assisted suicide. This law codifies the twenty-year-old convention of not prosecuting doctors who have committed euthanasia in very specific cases, under very specific circumstances. The Ministry of Public Health, Wellbeing and Sports claims that this practice \\"allows a person to end their life in dignity after having received every available type of palliative care.\\" The United Nations has reviewed and commented on the Netherlands euthanasia law. In September 2004 the Groningen Protocol was developed, which sets out criteria to be met for carrying out child euthanasia without the physician being prosecuted. =New Zealand= Assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia are illegal in New Zealand under Section 179 of the New Zealand Crimes Act 1961, which renders it a criminal offence to \\"aid and abet suicide.\\" Two decriminalisation attempts ‚Äì the Death With Dignity Bill 1995 and the Death With Dignity Bill 2003 ‚Äì failed, the latter by only a three-vote margin within the New Zealand Parliament. In May 2012, Labour Party of New Zealand MP Maryan Street introduced a private member's bill into the ballot box, the End of Life Choices Bill, which was taken over by MP Iain Lees-Galloway when she failed to get re-elected in the 2014 General Election. The bill was dropped in December 2014 at the request of Labour Party leader Andrew Little as the issue was deemed to be distracting from bigger issues that concerned the party. In November 2019, ACT MP David Seymour's End of Life Choice Bill, which will legalise assisted suicide for a select group of people if successful, passed its third reading 69 votes in favor to 51 opposed. In return for the New Zealand First party's support of the bill through its third reading, the bill be subject to a binding referendum held alongside the 2020 general election, which will take place on 17 October 2020. If a majority of voters support the referendum, the End of Life Choice Act will come into force 12 months after the official referendum results are declared. =Norway= Active voluntary euthanasia remains illegal, though a caregiver may receive a reduced punishment for taking the life of someone who consents to it. Passive euthanasia is legal. =Peru= Euthanasia is a delict under the laws of Peru, although there have been some attempts to reform them. In October 2009, the Reviser Special Commission of the Penal Code of the Parliament expressed its support of a proposal that tried to amend article 112 of the Penal Code, but it did not succeed. However, at the beginning of 2015, the case of the Chilean woman young Valentina Maureira, who suffered from cystic fibrosis, an incurable disease, and who asked that euthanasia be allowed in her country, attracted the interest of the press of Chile and also of foreign media. On 4 March of the same year, the Peruvian legislator Roberto Angulo √Ålvarez, membership of Dignity and Democracy parliamentary group, motivated by this case, presented a bill that proposed to allow assisted death in case of terminal or degenerative disease, with the objective of \\"avoid the physical and psychological pains of the patient, as well the unnecessary expenses for the family members and the State\\". Angulo √Ålvarez also argued that his legislative project \\"would contribute to respect for individual freedom and human dignity\\". =Portugal= The issue hit the headlines following a petition calling for euthanasia to be legalized, it rode headlong into controversy with the full knowledge of the nursing staff. One of the current ‚Äòhot topics‚Äô in Portugal, the deeply divisive issue was latest point of friction between faith and politics in a Catholic and a Republican country. A proposal to make Portugal one of only a handful of countries allowing euthanasia and doctor-assisted suicide was narrowly rejected (115-110 vote) by lawmakers on late May 2018. Following the 2019 elections the issue began to be discussed again in the Assembly of the Republic, where, as of February 2020, it is expected to be approved by left-wing and liberal parties. On 20 February 2020, Portugal's parliament voted to approve plans to introduce voluntary euthanasia laws. =Philippines= Euthanasia is illegal in the Philippines. In 1997, the Philippine Senate considered passing a bill legalizing passive euthanasia. The bill met strong opposition from the country's Catholic Church. If legalized the Philippines would have been the first country to legalize euthanasia. Under current laws, doctors assisting a patient to die can be imprisoned and charged with malpractice. =South Korea= The National Assembly and The Ministry of Health and Welfare voted in favor of active and passive euthanasia and went into effect since February 2018, and has announced to issue a \\"Well-Dying\\" Bill. However, the topic and debate of euthanasia in South Korea sparked for a long time, starting back on 4 December 1997 when a doctor was sent to prison for a major duration for voluntarily cutting life support of a braindead patient who injured himself from a head trauma, upon the request of his wife. This incident is well known in Korea as 'Boramae Hospital Incident' (Î≥¥ÎùºÎß§Î≥ëÏõê ÏÇ¨Í±¥). Another incident that sparked further debate was from the imprisonment of a father who plugged off a respirator for his braindead son. Patients who qualify for active or passive euthanasia in South Korea are reserved for the terminally ill with a nonexistent chance of recovery. Patients who have a beneficial reaction to any medications, or are not in a rapidly deteriorating state of health leading to imminent death may not be qualified. Patients must have a confirmation of a registered physician and a doctor to die under dignity, and comatose patients must have the approval of both guardians. =Spain= Active euthanasia or assisted suicide are not legal in Spain. Passive euthanasia, however, is legal. Currently, a bill to allow active euthanasia is being discussed by the senate. In February 2020 the Spanish parliament voted to approve plans to legalise voluntary euthanasia. The bill will now go to committee and the Senate before a final vote in the lower house. =Sweden= Passive euthanasia was deemed legal after a landmark court ruling in 2010. That means a health care professional can legally cease life support upon request from a patient if they understand the consequences stated by their health care provider, and administering a lethal substance is also illegal. =Switzerland= In Switzerland, deadly drugs may be prescribed to a Swiss person or to a foreigner, where the recipient takes an active role in the drug administration. More generally, article 115 of the Swiss penal code, which came into effect in 1942 (having been written in 1918), considers assisting suicide a crime only if the motive is selfish. =Turkey= Euthanasia is strictly forbidden in Turkey. The aide who helped a person to suicide or other ways to kill oneself will be punished for assisting and encouraging suicide under the stipulation of article 84 of the Turkish Criminal Law. In condition of active euthanasia, article 81 of the same law sets forth that any person who carries out this act will be judged and punished for life imprisonment just like a simple murder. =United Kingdom= Active euthanasia is illegal in the United Kingdom. Any person found to be assisting suicide is breaking the law and can be convicted of assisting suicide or attempting to do so.Suicide Act 1961 s.2 Between 2003 and 2006 Lord Joffe made four attempts to introduce bills that would have legalised voluntary euthanasia ‚Äì all were rejected by the UK Parliament. Currently, Dr Nigel Cox is the only British doctor to have been convicted of attempted euthanasia. He was given a 12-month suspended sentence in 1992. In regard to the principle of double effect, in 1957 Judge Devlin in the trial of Dr John Bodkin Adams ruled that causing death through the administration of lethal drugs to a patient, if the intention is solely to alleviate pain, is not considered murder even if death is a potential or even likely outcome. Passive euthanasia is legal, by way of advance decisions giving patients the right to refuse life saving treatment. Food and liquid can also be withdrawn from someone in a permanent vegetative state without the need for court approval. =United States= Active euthanasia is illegal throughout the United States. Patients retain the rights to refuse medical treatment and to receive appropriate management of pain at their request (passive euthanasia), even if the patients' choices hasten their deaths. Additionally, futile or disproportionately burdensome treatments, such as life-support machines, may be withdrawn under specified circumstances and, under federal law and most state laws only with the informed consent of the patient or, in the event of the incompetence of the patient, with the informed consent of the legal surrogate. The Supreme Court of the United States has not dealt with \\"quality of life issues\\" or \\"futility issues\\" and appears to only condone active or passive \\"euthanasia\\" (not legally defined) when there is clear and convincing evidence that informed consent to the euthanasia, passive or active, has been obtained from the competent patient or the legal surrogate of the incompetent patient. While active euthanasia is illegal throughout the U.S., assisted suicide is legal in Colorado, Oregon, Hawaii, Washington, Vermont, Maine, New Jersey, California, the District of Columbia, one county in New Mexico, and is de facto legal in Montana. Additionally, Louisiana specifically prohibits euthanasia in its Bill of Rights as cruel and unusual punishment. =Uruguay= Since 1933 the Penal Code of Uruguay, article 37, accept Compassionate Homicide, the first legal document that include euthanasia. It's important to say that this legal document didn't use this denomination. In another article, 127, the judge could waive the doctor, if this action was made by patient pledge and the doctor had an honorable reputation.Reta A, Grezzi O. C√≥digo penal de la Rep√∫blica Oriental del Uruguay. 4th ed. Montevideo: Fundaci√≥n de Cultura Universitaria; 1996. The main source of this Penal Code was Jimen√©z de As√∫a, a Spanish penalist, that introduce this concept in his book \\"Libertad de amar y derecho a morir: ensayos de un criminalista sobre eugenesia, eutanasia, endocrinolog√≠a\\", published in Madrid/Spain, in 1928.As√∫a LJ de. Libertad de amar y derecho a morir: ensayos de un criminalista sobre eugenesia, eutanasia, endocrinolog√≠a. Madrid: Historia Nueva; 1928. The first proposal to understand Euthanasia as homicide was made by Ruy Santos in his MD thesis, \\"Da resistencia dos estados m√≥rbidos √† therapeutica e da incurabilidade perante a euthan√°sia\\", at Faculdade de Medicina da Bahia/Brazil, in 1928. He made a difference between Euthanasia as homicide and Euthanasia as suicide, probably the first citation about Assisted Suicide.Santos R. Da euthan√°sia nos incur√°veis dolorosos. These de doutoramento. Salvador (Bahia): Faculdade de Medicina da Bahia; 1928. Non- governmental organizations There are a number of historical studies about the thorough euthanasia-related policies of professional associations. In their analysis, . found it necessary to distinguish such topics as euthanasia, physician-assisted suicide, informed consent and refusal, advance directives, pregnant patients, surrogate decision-making (including neonates), DNR orders, irreversible loss of consciousness, quality of life (as a criterion for limiting end-of-life care), withholding and withdrawing intervention, and futility. Similar distinctions presumably are found outside the U.S., as with the highly contested statements of the British Medical Association.On the BMA controversy. For professional policies in the English-speaking world, see this selection by an advocacy NGO. On euthanasia (narrowly defined here as directly causing death), Brody sums up the U.S. medical NGO arena: > The debate in the ethics literature on euthanasia is just as divided as the > debate on physician-assisted suicide, perhaps more so.

(2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, , p. 11 The Banned's original home pressing on Can't Eat Records (Eat Up 1) was taken up by EMI's Harvest label. The Banned originated from Tooting and Camberwell in London.

They recorded \\"Little Girl\\" in an attempt to take advantage of the popularity of punk rock, or in Aitken's words to \\"work a scam to do this punk thing\\". The line-up changed in the first few months with Tommy Steal (real name Jimmy Hughes) replacing Davie on bass and Ben Dover (Ben Grove) replacing Harvey on guitar. This line-up recorded the second single \\"Him or Me\\" with \\"You Dirty Rat\\" on the B-side. For their Top of the Pops performance of \\"Little Girl\\" in December 1977, Sordid, Fresh and Steal were joined by Sugar Kane (real name David Owen Smith) on 12 string guitar. Due to management problems the band folded six months later, but Aitken and Grove continued working together in a band called The Retros. Paul Sordid appeared on Never Mind The Buzzcocks in 2004. Jimmy Hughes joined the electronic pop band Cowboys International. The Banned reformed in 2009 and played at the 12 Bar Club in London, and the Rebellion Festival in Blackpool. The track \\"Little Girl\\" is on a number of compilation albums - notably The Best Punk Album in The World Ever 2, Totally Sensational 70s, and Rare Stuff. A historical CD of their recordings was released by Cherry Red Records in 2004, including tracks by Precious Little and The Retros. With only one single making the UK Singles Chart (No. 36 in December 1977 for \\"Little Girl\\"), the Banned join the list of one-hit wonders; a list that includes other UK punk or new wave acts such as John Cooper Clarke, Jilted John, 999, the Radio Stars, the Rich Kids and The Vibrators.

It went to take part in an action at Rohilkhand in April 1774 during the First Rohilla War before being absorbed by the Marine Battalion in 1803. It was re- raised as the 2nd Bengal (European) Regiment in 1822 and took part in a deployment to Burma in 1825 before being disbanded in 1830. =The Victorian era= Battles of Saddalupar and Chillianwala in January 1849 The regiment was re-raised as the 2nd Bengal (European) Light Infantry from a nucleus of 1st Bengal (European) Regiment in 1839. It saw action at the Battle of Chillianwala in January 1849 and the Battle of Gujrat in February 1849 in the Punjab during the Second Anglo-Sikh War. The regiment became the 2nd Bengal (European) Fusiliers in 1850 was deployed to Burma again in 1853 during the Second Anglo-Burmese War and then served at the Siege of Delhi in autumn 1857 during the Indian Rebellion. After the Crown took control of the Presidency armies in the aftermath of the Indian Rebellion, the regiment became the 2nd Bengal Fusiliers in November 1859 and then the 1st Royal Bengal Fusiliers in May 1861. It was then renumbered as the 104th Regiment of Foot (Royal Bengal Fusiliers) on transfer to the British Army in September 1862. Although a new commanding officer was appointed on transfer to the British Army, both majors and six of the twelve captains had prior service in the regiment. During the cholera epidemic of 1869, the regiment left its barracks at Peshawar on the North West Frontier for the countryside, to try to alleviate the impact of the disease. After the regiment had returned to barracks with the end of the epidemic, the commanding officer's wife, Elizabeth Webber Harris, was presented with a gold replica Victoria Cross, by the officers of the regiment, for her tireless endeavours tending the sick men. The presentation had the approval of Queen Victoria and was made by General Sir Sam Browne, commander of the Peshawar garrison. The regiment embarked for England in 1871. As part of the Cardwell Reforms of the 1870s, where single-battalion regiments were linked together to share a single depot and recruiting district in the United Kingdom, the 104th was linked with the 101st Regiment of Foot (Royal Bengal Fusiliers), and assigned to district no. 70 at Ballymullen Barracks in Tralee. On 1 July 1881 the Childers Reforms came into effect and the regiment amalgamated with the 101st Regiment of Foot (Royal Bengal Fusiliers) to form the Royal Munster Fusiliers.

Roberson had also signed on sister FM station WITN-FM at 93.3 MHz (today's WERO) on September 6, 1961.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC- YB/1972/B-2%20YB%201972%20All-12.pdf These stations shared the same callsigns on FM and AM until 1985, when the FM facility became WDLX and the AM reverted to the WRRF calls. They shared the same building until about 2004. In 1996, new owner Pinnacle Broadcasting changed the calls for WDLX to WERO as the station adopted an Arrow 93.3 moniker and a classic hits format; to protect the copyright to the call letters, they switched WRRF to WDLX, although no change was made in its talk format. WDLX is today the flagship station for East Carolina University Pirates athletics and also broadcasts Carolina Hurricanes games. Starting in 2010, WDLX aired the Baltimore Orioles. WGHB is licensed to Farmville, North Carolina and was once WFAG, meaning \\"Watch Farmville Area Grow\\". It exists mainly to improve WDLX' nighttime coverage in the Greenville area. WDLX must adjust its coverage to protect a silent clear- channel station in Montreal at AM 940, limiting its nighttime coverage to the immediate area around Washington.

Among his many ideas are those about racing to claim assets, multitasking, rationing by waiting, divided ownership of complex assets, measurement costs, and the economic origins of democracy. In the process Barzel's work unearthed the economic rationale for many institutions and offered a framework for analyzing them.

Geography  The municipality is situated in Naturpark Th√ºringer Schiefergebirge-Obere Saale on the Hohenwarte-Stausee.  History  Honewarte was first mentioned in 1361. The place belonged to the county of Schwarzburg-Menschenberg, and after its dissolution from 1564 to 1918 to the Schwarzburg-Rudolst√§dter sovereignty of the county (principality) of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt. The operation of mills has shaped the small town on the Saale for centuries. The Rudolstadt company Grosch & Zitkow built a cartonboard factory in Hohenwarte in 1904. The population increased rapidly due to the influx of many workers. The construction of the Hohenwarte dam fundamentally changed the townscape. The Hohenwarte church was rebuilt in 1934‚Äì38 as a replacement for the lost church of Presswitz. For the workers at the Hohenwarte pumped-storage hydroelectricity power plant new residential buildings were built. In the 1960s the town had over 300 inhabitants. Since the Die Wende, the town has been particularly affected by demographic change; the population more than halved. In recent years, the population increased from 140 to 180. From 1993 to 1995 the municipality belonged to the municipal association of Saale-Loquitz . With the dissolution of this on October 19, 1995, Kaulsdorf took over administrative duties for Hohenwarte.

WMYT, a 10,000-watt AM which had been off the air since 1996 (when Hurricane Fran damaged the transmitter site and operations), signed on as the first station in the network with Darryl \\"Chuck\\" Langley serving as station manager. In September 1999, 89.7 Dove FM made its debut with \\"All music, all the time.\\" Program director Al Lanier described the format as starting with \\"joyous music\\" as in Psalm 100 followed by softer music for reflection. The music included \\"upbeat, sing-along church camp favorites,\\" orchestra arrangements, and urban gospel artists such as Andre Murrell. A Spanish language program aired on weekends, and radio stations in Haiti, Sudan and Uganda were planned.\\"Business Digest,\\" Star-News, April 29, 1997.Ben Steelman, \\"Praise Radio; It's the Gospel Truth: Christian Radio Is Gaining Popularity,\\" Star- News, December 14, 1999.

He played as a midfielder, spending most of his career with Oxford United, Southampton and Bournemouth. He was known by the nickname \\"Chicken George\\" throughout his career. Playing career Lawrence was born in Kensington, London and was a pupil at Christopher Wren School where he was spotted by Southampton's London scouting network, joining The Saints as a trainee in August 1979. He made his debut in a League Cup match against Chelsea on 6 October 1981 replacing Nick Holmes. He made his first appearance in the starting line-up on 17 October, replacing Mick Channon in a league game against Notts County. According to Holley & Chalk's The Alphabet of the Saints, he \\"soon brought added meaning to the word unpredictable\\". He was \\"full of strong surging runs\\" and \\"would, when remembering to take the ball with him, completely perplex opposing defenders and cause havoc in the penalty area\\". In his first period at The Dell, Southampton had an abundance of strikers, including Channon and Steve Moran, together with Kevin Keegan, Steve Williams and David Armstrong in midfield, so his chances were limited. He spent the end of the 1981‚Äì82 season on loan at Oxford United and, after returning to Southampton for the start of the following season, he moved permanently to Oxford in November 1982. After two years with Oxford, he was rather surprisingly re-signed by the Saints' newly appointed manager, Chris Nicholl. Again, Lawrence was in competition with several strikers including Moran, Joe Jordan, Alan Curtis and Danny Wallace. Lawrence knuckled down and, always with a smile on his face, set out to try to make his second spell more productive than the first. The 1986‚Äì87 season was his most successful with Southampton, making 36 League appearances and was the club's (joint) second- best scorer for the season with eight goals (a long way behind Colin Clarke with twenty). It was somewhat of a surprise to the Saints fans, therefore, when he was sold to Millwall for ¬£160,000 in July 1987, although by now Matt Le Tissier and Alan Shearer were coming up through the ranks and were pushing for promotion to the first team. In his two periods with the Saints he made 104 appearances in all competitions, scoring 15 goals. In his first season at Millwall, he helped them win the Football League Division 2 championship, and then spent the 1988‚Äì89 season with them in the First Division. He then spent three years at Bournemouth before spending the summer of 1992 in Finland with Mikkelin Palloilijat. In 1993, he made 14 appearances for Portsmouth, all from the substitutes' bench (without scoring). He finished his playing career with a spell in Malta, playing with Hibernians F.C. where he won two consecutive titles, followed by lower-league football. Since retiring from playing professionally, he has continued to turn out in veterans' matches as well as earning a living as a player's agent. Honours ;Millwall *Football League Second Division championship: 1987‚Äì88 ;Hibernians *Maltese Premier League championship: 1993‚Äì94, 1994‚Äì95 Chicken George Throughout his career, he was affectionately known by the nickname \\"Chicken George\\", after the character in the TV series Roots which was being aired on British television at the time he started his career.

In 1862 she was sold to United States owners and briefly used as a Union Army transport before being acquired by the Union Navy. She served as the armed steamship USS Estrella during the remainder of the American Civil War, carrying three heavy guns as well as two howitzers for shore bombardment. Returning to commercial service in 1867, Estrella operated under the American flag and, later, as the British-flag Twinkling Star on services within the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico area. She was seriously damaged in 1870 in Jamaica and later sank in port.  Construction  The iron side-wheel paddle steamer Estrella was launched by Samuda Brothers at Blackwall, London on the River Thames on 20 August 1853 for the newly- established Magdalena Steam Navigation Company. She was designed with shallow draught of , suitable for her intended river and coastal transport, and was approximately in length, with a beam of and tonnage of . In later United States Navy service she was 438 tons displacement. Estrella had capacity for 60‚Äì90 passengers The ship was powered by a two-cylinder oscillating steam engine with an output of 120 nominal horse-power manufactured by Humphrys, Tennant and Dykes at their new engineworks at Deptford. On her official trials on 27 October she averaged 12 miles per hour. Two smaller vessels were also built and engined for the company by the same shipbuilder and engineers, Anita and Isabel, intended for the passenger trade on the Magdalena River in the Republic of New Granada (now in Colombia).  Commercial service  Estrella and Anita sailed from the Thames together on 20 November 1853 and the former arrived at Savanilla, then the main seaport at the mouth of the Magdalena, on 17 January 1854 (Anita a week later) to be prepared for service. The timing was unfortunate, as revolution had broken out in Bogota, suppressing the demand for river freight. Nevertheless Estrella made a profitable voyage from Santa Marta to Mompox and Magangu√©, and a little later was chartered to General Mosquera to carry imported munitions up river. On 1 August 1855 she sank in the river Magdalena near Conejo en route to Honda after being holed by a rock; her passengers and crew were saved, and the ship was reported at Lloyd's of London as lost, but in the event refloated and repaired. In May 1856, the Magdalena Steam Navigation Company concluded that the venture was not sufficiently profitable and should be wound up, for which they intended their three vessels, Estrella, Anita and Isabel, which had been operating under the British flag, should be returned to England for sale. However, the company first sought purchasers at Barranquilla in September, with bids to be received by 15 November. Remaining unsold, Estrella and Anita sailed for England on 23 December, but after only two hours steaming Anita developed a serious leak and began sinking in an increasing gale. Some three hours later the boiler of Anita exploded and she sank in deep water, with the loss of half of her crew of 24. Estrella, also hampered by the conditions, was unable to assist the other ship and decided to put back to Santa Marta where she was surveyed at the British Vice-Consul's behest. It was found that Estrellas deck was hogged, probably as a result the earlier sinking and numerous groundings in the Magdalena, and that she was not seaworthy; in addition, the ship's boats were condemned as \\"entirely worthless\\". The surveyors advised that she should not leave the coast before the end of May 1857, when weather could be expected to have improved, and that she should carry additional engineers. In December 1861 Estrella was still in New Granada and provided safe haven for some residents of Santa Marta during the Colombian Civil War. In 1862 the ship was purchased at Savanilla by the firm McLean & Lintz of New York, where she arrived on 28 May after a nine-day voyage in ballast via Kingston, Jamaica; during the voyage she struck a wreck which damaged the starboard paddle wheel and she completed the voyage using only one. She was then documented at New York as an American ship and chartered by McLean & Lintz to the US Army Quartermaster Department as United States Transport Estrella from 7 July 1862 at US$400 per day.  United States Navy service  Destruction of the CSS Queen of the West by USS Estrella (left), USS Arizona (center) and USS Calhoun (right) on April 11, 1863 Estrella was transferred from the Army to the Navy late in 1862, and commissioned before the end of October, Lieutenant Commander A. P. Cooke in command. She was armed with three heavy guns ‚Äì two 32-pounders and one 30-pounder with rifled barrel ‚Äì and with two 24-pounder howitzers, proving versatile and useful in both stopping blockade runners at sea and at bombarding shore positions. Assigned to the West Gulf Blockading Squadron, Estrella served throughout the war off Mobile, Alabama, and New Orleans, Louisiana, along the Texas coast, and up the rivers flowing into the Gulf of Mexico. During the first 13 days of November 1862 she took part in a series of engagements with and Confederate shore batteries along the Atchafalaya River and Bayou Teche. With her captain serving as commander of the flotilla maintained in Berwick Bay, Estrella led the attack on CSS Queen of the West 14 April 1863. The Confederate ship was set afire by Union gunfire and, after 90 of her crew had been rescued, exploded. Four days later, Cooke led his flotilla up the Atchafalaya once more, to attack the batteries at Butte-a-la- Rose, Louisiana. The batteries were captured intact, with their garrison of 60 men and large supplies of ammunition and commissary stores. A Union Army garrison was at once sent up to hold the town, another key point won by the Union Navy in its continuing campaign to take complete control of coastal areas. From 3 to 6 May 1863, Estrella sailed up the Red River to join in the attack on Fort De Russy, and during June and July participated in the attacks on Port Hudson, Louisiana which led to its fall on 9 July. Other events in her active service included the capture of schooner Julia A. Hodges in Matagorda Bay, Texas, on 6 April 1864 and a leading role in the attacks on Fort Powell in Mobile Bay on 5 August 1864. These attacks were made in coordination with the battle of Mobile Bay. After being repaired at New Orleans in the first 4 months of 1865, Estrella served as flagship of the West Gulf Blockading Squadron, continuing to cruise in the Gulf of Mexico and its tributary waters until 30 June 1867, when she sailed for New York Navy Yard. Estrella was decommissioned there on 16 July 1867, and sold 9 October 1867. Return to commercial service According to American Lloyd's Register of 1868, Estrella was re-purchased from the Navy, as the entry is based on a December 1867 survey in New York, and in 1868 she was transferred to Henry Winn, secretary of the Intertropical Company, New York. In March 1868 Estrella was described as an \\"American\\" steamer when reported condemned at Kingston, Jamaica, but in the same year was owned by Lamb & Co of Saint Thomas, then part of the Danish West Indies, when seeking parity of treatment in Venezuelan ports with British ships. On 21 December 1868 the \\"intercolonial packet sateamer\\" Estrella was reported wrecked in the Los Roques archipelago on a voyage from Saint Thomas to La Guaira, Puerto Cabello and Curacao, with passengers, mail and general cargo. The passengers and crew survived for five days on an uninhabited island and were rescued on 27 December by the Venezuelan war steamer Bolivar. After being salved she was taken to Jamaica and was registered on 4 October 1869 as a British ship at the port of Kingston under the ownership of a local, Ralph Nirnes. Renamed Twinkling Star, she was given Official Number 61881, and remeasured at 492 GRT, 334 NRT and dimensions in length, beam and depth . Soon afterwards, on 27 November, on voyage from Cap-Ha√Øtien to Port au Prince, Twinkling Star developed an underwater crack below the waterline and began to take water; amid general panic, five passengers, including the American Consul in Jamaica, took to a boat and reached M√¥le-Saint-Nicolas, Haiti. The ship was later also safely brought to port A year later, on 30 November 1870, Twinkling Star sailed from Kingston for New Orleans but met very bad weather and was forced to put in to Savanna-la-Mar with boiler damage, leaking hull, sails blown away and a ship's boat stove in; and then in arriving went aground, requiring some of the cargo to be jettisoned. By 24 December she had been surveyed, condemned and ordered to be sold She remained on moorings at Savanna-la-Mar until 21 May 1873 when she sank in 10ft water  See also  * United States Navy * American Civil War * Confederate States Navy Notes References  External links  * USS Estrella (1862‚Äì1867) at Navsource Category:Ships built in England Category:Victorian-era merchant ships of the United Kingdom Category:Ships of the Union Navy Category:Steamships of the United States Navy Category:Gunboats of the United States Navy Category:American Civil War patrol vessels of the United States Category:1853 ships ","title":"USS Estrella (1862)"},{"id":"13662905","text":"WAAV (980 AM) is a radio station broadcasting a News/Talk format.

History WAAV debuted as a FM station in 1972 at 102.7, and would remain there until 1981, when Cape Fear Broadcasting from Fayetteville purchased WAAV and WGNI. At that time, the station flipped from FM to AM 1340; in 1984 the station moved to 980, where it remains today. The previous occupant of the 980 frequency was top 40 WKLM, part of the Harold Thoms Group.

The 4‚Äì4‚Äì5 calendar divides a year into four quarters of 13 weeks grouped into two 4-week \\"months\\" and one 5-week \\"month\\". The grouping of 13 weeks may also be set up as 5‚Äì4‚Äì4 weeks or 4‚Äì5‚Äì4. When this type of calendar is in use, reports with month-by-month comparisons or trends are flawed as one month is 25% longer than the other two. It could still compare a period to the same period in the prior year, or use week by week data comparisons. Its major advantage over a regular calendar is that the end date of the period is always the same day of the week, which is useful for shift or manufacturing planning as every period is the same length. A disadvantage of the 4‚Äì4‚Äì5 calendar is that it has only 364 days (7 days x 52 weeks), meaning a 53rd week will need to be added every five or six years: this can make year-on-year comparison difficult.  52‚Äì53-week fiscal year  The 52‚Äì53-week fiscal year is a variation on the 4‚Äì4‚Äì5 calendar. It is used by companies that desire that their fiscal year always end on the same day of the week. Any day of the week may be used, and Saturday and Sunday are common because the business may more easily be closed for counting inventory and other end-of-year accounting activities. There are two methods in use: = Last Saturday of the month at fiscal year end = Under this method the company's fiscal year is defined as the final Saturday (or other day selected) in the fiscal year end month. For example, if the fiscal year end month is August, the company's year end could fall on any date from August 25 to August 31. In particular, the last fiscal week is the one that includes August 25 and the first fiscal week of the following year is the one that includes September 1. In this scenario, fiscal years would end on the following days:      * The end of the fiscal year moves one day earlier on the calendar each year (or two days when there is an intervening leap day) until it would otherwise reach the date seven days before the end of the month (August 24 in this case) or earlier. At that point it resets to the end of the month (August 31) or earlier and the fiscal year has 53 weeks instead of 52. In this example the fiscal years ending in 2013, 2019, and 2024 have 53 weeks. = Saturday nearest the end of month = Under this method the company's fiscal year is defined as the Saturday (or other day selected) that falls closest to the last day of the fiscal year end month. For example, if the fiscal year end month is August, the company's year end could fall on any date from August 28 to September 3. In particular, the last fiscal week is the one that includes August 28 and the first fiscal week of the following year is the one that includes September 4. In this scenario, fiscal years would end on the following days:      * The end of the fiscal year moves one day earlier on the calendar each year (or two days when there is an intervening leap day) until it would otherwise reach the date four days before the end of the month (August 27 in this case) or earlier. At that point the first Saturday in the following month (September 3 or earlier in this case) becomes the date closest to the end of August and it resets to that date and the fiscal year has 53 weeks instead of 52. In this example the fiscal years ending in 2016, 2022, and 2028 have 53 weeks. The 52‚Äì53 week method is permitted by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, by US Internal Revenue Code Regulation 1.441-2 (IRS Publication 538)., as well as the International Financial Reporting Standards.IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements References  See also  * Symmetry454 Category:Business terms Category:Accounting systems Category:Management accounting Category:Specific calendars ","title":"4‚Äì4‚Äì5 calendar"},{"id":"13663007","text":"Evergreen Burial Park is a cemetery located at 1307 Summit Avenue, SW in the Raleigh Court neighborhood of Roanoke, Virginia.

He is best known as the owner of Palumbo's, an entertainment complex in South Philadelphia, Nostalgia's Restaurant and the Click Club. In the city, he is still widely known for his philanthropy: donating animals to the Philadelphia Zoo, helping build youth programs and funding parades. He has been called \\"a supporter of politicians, ordinary folk and animals.\\" Palumbo expanded a boarding house his grandfather, Antonio Palumbo, had started in 1884 into an entertainment complex.The Neglected Market ‚Äì article at Penn's Department of Folklore and Folklife's Research Annex Palumbo held significant unofficial political power throughout the city. In the 1940s and 1950s, Philadelphia was an important pop music center, with many bands and singers being made or broken in the city at Palumbo's clubs. Palumbo became well known for philanthropy throughout South Philadelphia. Disturbed by an article critical of the area, singer Mario Lanza penned a response which identified Palumbo as an unsung hero of the city. Lanza lauded Palumbo for taking thousands of orphans to the circus, arranging parades for visiting celebrities and buying animals for the zoo.Mario Lanza, Modern Screen, September 1950.

Palumbo's wife Vanda \\"Kippee\\" Bozzacco (1919‚Äì2003) was a former actress and, at Palumbo's side, became \\"one of Philadelphia's first ladies\\".  Night clubs  Palumbo owned and operated numerous Philadelphia night clubs: Nostalgia's Restaurant and the legendary Click Club and Ciro's, along with Palumbo's, the Thirteen Club, the Hideaway, the S.A. Club and the 20th Century clubs all at 13th and Locust Streets, forming the heart of Philadelphia's nightclub district. By connecting all of the clubs through a series of doors, Palumbo operated all of them with a single hard to obtain liquor license, possible only through his political connections at the state Liquor Control Board.Blavat, Jerry. You Only Rock Once: My Life in Music. Running Press, 2013. The Click Club featured the world's longest bar and a rotating stage large enough for two bands, so as to provide uninterrupted music. To promote the club's opening on Labor Day, 1946, the \\"Frank Palumbo Award\\" was created for the most valuable Philadelphia baseball player, as voted by Philadelphia sports writers. Schoolboy Rowe was selected for the award and Louis Prima was engaged to play. Prima was also planned to perform national anthem at the Phillies game earlier that day to promote the opening. Due to union rules, he was not allowed to play at the game, instead singing and awarding the trophy to Rowe. A banner plane advertised Prima's appearance that evening to great effect. 38,000 people showed up for the opening, 3,000 more than the stadium seated.Rose, Al.

Mob tie allegations  Palumbo was the subject of regular insinuation and speculation. An Inquirer Magazine article in 1975 suggested that his intense need for privacy and philanthropic zeal may have been used to cover an unexplained secret life of some kind. Unsubstantiated rumors of Mafia connections were common.Frank Sinatra, A Thrown Fight, & The Rise of Pop Warner Football by David G. Tomlin. Kefauver Committee hearings in 1950 connected Palumbo with mob numbers games, with his nightclub identified as the headquarters for roughly fifty of the city's numbers banks. = Frank Sinatra and the fixed fight = Frank Sinatra was a long-time friend of Palumbo, frequently performing at his clubs. Palumbo was best man when Sinatra married Ava Gardner. In 1947, Sinatra turned to him for help with his image when press reports tied Sinatra to the Mafia. Together, they promoted a youth football league to provide an activity for urban children and generate positive press for them both. Sinatra had been photographed in Cuba with top American mobsters at a mob wake, was widely accused of womanizing, and reportedly had assaulted a reporter. On 14 November 1947, Billy Fox threw a boxing match against Jake LaMotta at the request of the mob. LaMotta's manager, Al Silvani, was Sinatra's former bodyguard and friend. Fox was co- managed by Palumbo and Frank \\"Blinky\\" Palermo, a mobster who ran Philadelphia's policy racket.Jeff Merron, ESPN.com. Page 2 ‚Äì \\"Reel Life: 'Raging Bull'\\". Accessed 7 January 2008. As Sinatra and Palumbo were both threatened by the resulting investigation, they worked together to generate positive press coverage. Palumbo had been a long time supporter of the Pop Warner Junior Football Conference. Through Palumbo's dealings a \\"Santa Claus Bowl\\" was arranged. Philadelphia's \\"Venango Midgets\\" were renamed \\"Frank Palumbo's Clickets\\". They took on the newly formed, and thus \\"undefeated\\", \\"Frank Sinatra's Cyclones\\" in a game heavily promoted by the Philadelphia Daily News. The News cited a fictional nationwide bidding war for coverage with other newspapers, a planned (though likely impossible) appearance by Sinatra, alleged bids to host a planned 1948 bowl and the supposed support of Milton Berle, Al Jolson, Bob Hope, Mickey Rooney and Jimmy Durante. After the game, Palumbo drew the names of two players for trips to the Sugar Bowl, generating three more days of coverage as the News ran articles penned by one of the winners. = Angelo Bruno = A 1950‚Äì1 U.S. Senate investigation into organized crime found that Palumbo's CR Club was the meeting place for some 50 of the Philadelphia mob's numbers game backers. Palermo escaped with a small fine for \\"impertinent ... sarcastic answers\\". Palumbo briefly evaded this subpoena before his lawyer Jake Kossmann got him cleared without charges. After the investigation, the Senate's file connecting Palumbo with Palermo disappeared. In addition to being Palumbo's lawyer, Kossman also worked for mob associate Frank \\"Blinky\\" Palermo, crime boss Frank Costello, mob-involved union leader Jimmy Hoffa and Philadelphia mob boss Angelo Bruno. Bruno assassination on 12 March 1980 outside his home in South Philadelphia, took place immediately after dining with Kossmann. Kossmann was also a trustee for the Pop Warner Football League. A 1962 federal wiretap determined that Bruno's mob used the \\"secure\\" phone in Palumbo's for most of their dealings.

The Tracy Mansion is visible to the viewer's right. Its main entrance, now leading to a reading room, is no longer used. The Tracy Mansion as public library, 1899. The tree to the left, where the modern wing now is, is a massive colonial elm, which must have been standing when George Washington stayed as a dinner guest there. Newburyport Public Library, in Newburyport, Massachusetts, was founded in September, 1854, by Josiah Little. It opened its doors to the public on September 5, 1855, in Ward Room 4 of the new City Hall. On that day its collection amounted to about 5750 books. Its operating budget depended at first on legacies and the generosity of private citizens. The library flourished.  History  =Earliest libraries of Newburyport= In 1794 a board of several interested citizens calling themselves the Newburyport Library Association established a circulating library, the Newburyport Library, in downtown Newburyport, advertising for subscribers. The booksellers had already been forming circulation libraries in their stores since before 1794 and these continued as adjuncts to the book-selling businesses. =The Tracy Mansion= A renovated and expanded 18th century Federalist mansion currently houses the Newburyport Public Library. In the period of the Revolutionary War it was among the most notable mansion of Newburyport, owned by the Tracys, the leading family of the times. The mansion was the concept of Patrick Tracy (1711, Wexford County, Ireland to 1789), who came from Ireland penniless and went to work as a sailor on ships built in Newburyport's shipyards. A successful mariner, he became a ship's officer, a navigator, a master and finally an owner. In the end he owned an import/export business utilizing fleets of ships, which made him very wealthy. His main interests outside of business, however, were St. Paul's Church, where he was a vestryman, and building the future City of Newburyport. He married Hannah Gookin, a minister's daughter. In 1751 his son, Nathaniel Tracy, was born. In due time he was sent to Harvard College, matriculating with the Class of 1769. The Tracys were ardent supporters of the Patriot cause. In 1775 Nathaniel had constructed and outfitted the first Yankee privateer, and was so successful that a fleet of warships followed, all acting under letters of marque. He also built merchant ships and began buying property on the east coast of the colonies. It was said that he could journey by land to Philadelphia sleeping only in his own houses. In 1775 also he married Mary Lee, considered to be \\"a great beauty.\\" Her father was elected to the first Continental Congress by Marblehead. For their wedding gift Patrick had constructed a new mansion on State Street (the center of the city), now the library. After the formation of the United States, the vicissitudes of fortune turned against Nathaniel. The Continental Congress had unleashed a fleet of pirates against British commerce. Unencumbered by the war, the British moved to defend themselves. Most of the privateers had been lost through attrition in the war. The remaining vessels were detained in whatever port they were using for supply, the crews were imprisoned or impressed into the British Navy and the ships, unable to sail, were abandoned. The merchant fleet fared no better. One of Nathaniel's agents had delivered a load of scrap masts to the French Navy, which was hoping to avail itself of solid American wood (such as the massive white pines still seen in Newburyport) and as a result Nathaniel's ships were blacklisted from European commerce. In addition, American ships were no longer protected as colonial by European treaties. The sentiment of foreign governments was that the new United States, although it could defend its own soil with French assistance, could not defend its interests abroad. All the powers of Europe joined in the plunder. American crews and cargoes were seized everywhere or delayed in port until their cargos spoiled. Americans became a special target of the Barbary Corsairs. In an ironic turn of events, they went into slavery in the Ottoman Empire along with over a million Europeans. Following George Washington's policy of avoiding foreign wars and entanglements, Congress paid a significant portion of the national budget to corsair states such as Tripoli, but to no avail. The outlook for Americans abroad did not improve until the new United States Navy sent squadrons carrying marines to the Mediterranean, in such conflicts as the First Barbary War, and elsewhere, defeated the British again in the War of 1812 and subsequently began to enforce the Monroe Doctrine. These events in the rise of American sea power were far too late for Nathaniel Tracy: \\"... he found himself hopelessly involved in financial difficulties, owing large sums of money which he could not pay, and with the close of the War, his wealth vanished like smoke.... In 1786, he found himself bankrupt.\\" His land assets were resold at a fraction of what he had paid for them. He finally retired to Spencer-Peirce-Little Farm in Newbury, Massachusetts, and died there. His eleven children and those of his brother and sister went on to found families from which many leading men and women of New England were to descend, including Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes. The home in Newburyport did not then pass out of the family; it was taken over by Nathaniel's brother- in-law and former business partner, Jonathan Jackson, entering a new period of splendor. Among its visitors were the first president of the United States, George Washington, Lafayette, Talleyrand, Louis-Phillipe and others. When the family no longer had an interest in remaining there, they sold it as a hotel. Finally, now aging fast, it became a rooming-house. It was at this point that the subscribers to the new Newburyport Public Library expressed an interest in purchasing and renovating it. =Foundation of the library= The free public library, as the then new type of institution was beginning to be called, of Newburyport was conceived by Josiah Little, Charles Jackson and Samuel Swett as a circulation library with the fees paid by benefactors and the city. The citizens could then circulate the books for free. Little began with a donation of $5000, while Jackson and Swett followed suit with money and books. An agreement was drawn up with the City in which the three called themselves \\"the subscribers.\\" They would provide the initial endowment while Newburyport, Newbury and West Newbury would pay a pro-rated portion of the operating expenses plus 1% per annum on the overhead. On November 20, 1854, the Mayor ordered the foundation of the \\"Public Library of the City of Newburyport\\" and the City Council, which had approved, passed an ordinance for its governing. The library opened on The demand for books was so great that the directors began almost immediately seeking larger, better quarters, which would require more money. The means evaded them until 1860 when the Newburyport Lyceum agreed to sell tickets to lectures by persons of special invitation, who would do it for free, and donate the proceeds to the Library Building Fund. The lecturers were mainly ministers and academics. Over three seasons about $1000 was collected. At this point Edward S. Moseley, a banker and one of the wealthiest men in Newburyport, placed himself and his friends on the subscription list. The names are familiar from today's streets and structures: the Hales, Cushings, Currier, Coffin, Forbes, Moulton, and so on, and others from as far away as New York and London. The fund soon expanded to about $20,000. The Tracy Mansion was for sale and was enthusiastically purchased as new home for the library. Any building converted for library use must be reinforced to bear the weight of the books. The Tracy home was totally redesigned, internally, externally and grounds, by Arthur Gilman of Boston, a native of Newburyport, \\"making no charge for his services.\\" A time capsule was placed in a cornerstone, stating that the building was \\"free gift to the City.\\" George W. Jackson, Jr., was mayor, and Hiram A. Tenney Librarian. The date was April 6, 1865. The final deed of conveyance specified among other conditions that the building must be used \\"exclusively for the city library,\\" and that it \\"shall not be open for public use on the Lord's Day.\\" The Board of Aldermen accepted the gift by vote on September 4, 1865, and passed the appropriate ordinances. 21st century In 2001, the Edward G.

Canarian nationalism is a political movement that encourages the national consciousness of the Canarian people. The term includes several ideological trends, ranging from the right to self-determination (and complete independence from Spain) to a demand for further autonomy within Spain. Self-government through history The origins of what is now considered \\"Canarian people\\" started with the Spanish conquest of the islands, when the local Guanche Berber populationHupalupa, Magos, Ma√∫ros, Majoreros or Amasik was defeated and eventually assimilated and European-style manorialism introduced in most of the islands. Abreu Galindo, Historia de La Conquista de las siete Islas de Canaria During the last days of the conquest, on 30 May 1481, a Guanche leader from Gran Canaria called Tenesor Semid√°n (afterwards baptized as Fernando Guanarteme) signed a peace treaty with Ferdinand II of Aragon, in the so-called Carta de Calatayud.Ovetense (\\"y as√≠ se le hizo su bautismo con gran solemnidad, como a persona real\\"). This treaty defined the archipelago as a kingdom within the Spanish monarchy, establishing the legal framework for its administration and its relationship with Spain.Juan Bethencuort Alfonso, Historia del Pueblo Guanche, vol 2 The pact signed in Calatayud granted the rights and duties that would shape the Canarian fuero (), which would soon be utilized in institutions such as the Cabildos and the Canarian Court ('). Notable rights stated in the fuero included an autonomous treasury and army, and the continuity of traditional Canarian customs and roles. The Canary Islands had its own currency until 1776.Abreu Galindo, (\\"Que todas las franquezas y libertades que ten√≠an, se le guardar√≠an\\"). Initially only Gran Canaria accepted the pact, but one by one the whole archipelago eventually consented to the agreement.El pacto para Tenerife, Juan Bethencuort Alfonso, Historia del Pueblo Guanche, tomo III Spain failed to fulfill the pact several times, a failure that resulted in the uprisings of 1502 (Ichasagua), 1770 (La Aldea), and 1778 (Arico).Juan Bethencuort Alfonso, Historia del Pueblo Guanche, vol 3 The pact was finally discarded during the Restoration. The flag that was hoisted at the Ateneo in 1907, the first nationalist flag. Beginnings of organized nationalism The first nationalist organizations were born in the 19th century as part of a local labour movement. Some of its proponents were Jos√© Cabrera D√≠az, Nicol√°s Est√©vanez and Secundino Delgado. Delgado is considered today as the father of the Canarian nationalism. The earliest nationalist parties were the Partido Popular (Autonomista), founded in 1901 in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, and the Canarian Nationalist Party, founded in 1924 in exile in Cuba. During the Second Spanish Republic Canarian nationalism went unnoticed; although an autonomy statute was proposed, the Spanish Civil War blocked hopes for autonomy. The flag made by the Canarias Libre movement Flag of the MPAIAC During the dictatorship Francoism fiercely oppressed any kind of regional nationalism in Spain and its colonies. However, the 1960s were years known for the activism of various groups. In 1959 the movement Canarias Libre acquired some notoriety, and in 1964, Antonio Cubillo founded the MPAIAC (Movement for the Self-determination and Independence of the Canarian Archipelago). The MPAIAC created the flag of the seven green stars that is accepted by the nationalist movement as a whole today. During the last days of Francoism the DAC (Destacamentos Armados Canarios) and the FAG (Fuerzas Armadas Guanches), movements attached to Canarian nationalism, committed terrorist acts. Although the movements had initially attracted sympathies, the violent terror actions and the \\"armed struggle\\" spearheaded by Cubillo's MPAIAC brought about a general rejection among local Canarios. Spanish democracy Canarian flag proposed by Azarug Since 1982 the Canary Islands have had a statute of autonomy, which defines the archipelago as a nationality of Spain. In the 1980s a nationalist-like party called UPC (Canarian People's Union) was the third-most-voted party in Canary Islands. In 1985 Antonio Cubillo returned from Algiers and founded the National Congress of the Canaries (CNC). Since 1993, the nationalist party Canarian Coalition has held the government of the islands. Current situation At present, many sorts of parties, trade unions and associations describe themselves as \\"nationalist,\\" some of which support the Berberist cause. The nationalist parties include CC (Canarian Coalition), NC (Nueva Canarias), FREPIC-AWA√ëAK (Popular Front of the Canary Islands), CCN (Nationalist Canarian Centre), ANC (Canarian Nationalist Alternative), Azarug, Partido Nacionalista Canario Alternativa Popular Canaria, Alternativa Maga Nacionalista, and UP (Unidad del Pueblo). There are also nationalist trade unions such as FSOC (Frente Sindical Obrero Canario), IC (Intersindical Canaria), as well as revolutionary organizations, like Inekaren. Some radical groups use the word Taknara to refer to the Canary Islands, but other nationalists do not agree with this name.Antonio Cubillo Ferreira, About the made up name Taknara... The movement has recently undergone a modest renaissance. The popular newspaper of the islands El D√≠a has changed its editorial line to fit the nationalists' cause. In its pages it is normal to read the opinion of historical nationalist activists. In particular the \\"Project for a Federal Canarian Republic\\", written by Antonio Cubillo, has created a stir and a media debate.

Biography Thomas was born in Eden, Mississippi on October 14, 1926. While working in the fields, he began listening to blues on the radio. As a self- taught guitarist, he learned to play songs from older blues guitarists Elmore Davis and Arthur \\"Big Boy\\" Crudup. He then worked as a gravedigger in Washington County. Thomas became known after appearing in films made by the Center for Southern Folklore in the 1970s. He appeared in the films Delta Blues Singer: James \\"Sonny Ford\\" Thomas, Give My Poor Heart Ease: Mississippi Delta Bluesmen, and Mississippi Delta Blues. In the 1970s, Eddie Cusic performed with Thomas at regular engagements. Together they recorded \\"Once I Had a Car\\", which is included on the compilation album Mississippi Delta & South Tennessee Blues (1977). In the 1980s, Thomas recorded internationally. While working as gravedigger, he was also a folk artist, making sculptures from unfired clay, which he dug out of the banks of the Yazoo River. His most famous sculpted images were skulls (often featuring actual human teeth), which mirrored his job as a gravedigger and his often stated philosophy that \\"we all end up in the clay\\". In 1985, his work was featured in the prestigious Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D.C., where he was introduced to Nancy Reagan, then the First Lady. Thomas's skulls are on display in the Delta Blues Museum, in Clarksdale, Mississippi, and the Highway 61 Blues Museum, in Leland, Mississippi. Thomas played at numerous blues festivals and private parties throughout the area, including the Mississippi Delta Blues and Heritage Festival in Greenville. In later performances, Thomas was accompanied by the Swiss harmonica player Walter Liniger. Thomas was recorded by several small record labels and is probably best known for his album Gateway to the Delta, recorded by Rust College in Holly Springs, Mississippi. Thomas died at the age of 66 in Greenville, Mississippi, from emphysema and a stroke on June 26, 1993. He is buried in Leland and memorialized by a headstone placed in 1996 by the Mt. Zion Memorial Fund and paid for by John Fogerty. His epitaph consists of lyrics from one of his songs. His son, Pat Thomas, continues to play and perform his father's songs. Thomas was honored with a marker on the Mississippi Blues Trail in Leland, Mississippi.

At the top of the mountain there is the ruin of a mediaeval castle, of which two towers and some wall fragments are still standing. A smaller first castle was already built there in the late 13th century by the Lichtenburg noble family. Later, the site was home to the Zaj√≠c family: in 1335, Zbynƒõk Zaj√≠c, a powerful aristocrat during the times of Charles IV., purchased it, and made it the center of his estates. In Czech, the word zaj√≠c means hare, so the name of castle and hill is a mediaeval play on the name of its most prominent owners, who even had hares in their coat of arms. Zbynƒõk Zaj√≠c considerably enlarged and extended the castle, and in particular added the two prominent towers which survive to this day. The castle was never taken by force, despite multiple siege attempts during the Hussite wars. After these wars, it apparently fell into disuse and gradually was reduced to a ruin: records from the year 1586 already describe it as desolate.

The school is a member of the Toronto Catholic District School Board, formerly the Metropolitan Separate School Board and is named after Salvadoran archbishop Oscar Romero, who was assassinated in 1980. The school building was opened in 1967 as York Humber High School by the Board of Education for the City of York when the board merged into the Toronto District School Board in which the school is leased to the MSSB/TCDSB since 1989. St. Oscar Romero's school motto is \\"Community, Justice, and Knowledge\\". History =Patron= √ìscar Arnulfo Romero y Gald√°mez was a bishop of the Catholic Church in El Salvador and became the fourth Archbishop of San Salvador, succeeding Luis Ch√°vez. He was assassinated on March 24, 1980. After his assassination, Romero was succeeded by Monsignor Arturo Rivera. In 1997, a cause for beatification and canonization was opened for Romero, and Pope John Paul II bestowed upon him the title of Servant of God. His canonization was finalized in 2018. He is considered by some of the unofficial patron saint of the Americas and El Salvador and is often referred to as \\"San Romero\\" by Catholics in El Salvador. Outside of Catholicism, Romero is honored by other religious denominations of Christendom, including the Church of England through the Calendar in Common Worship. He is one of the ten 20th-century martyrs who are depicted in statues above the Great West Door of Westminster Abbey in London, a testament to the wide respect for him even beyond the Catholic Church. In 2008, he was chosen as one of the 15 Champions of World Democracy by the Europe-based magazine A Different View.A Different View, Issue 19, January 2008. =School= Throughout the 20th century, Catholic education in the City of York was served by nearby Roman Catholic schools ran by the religious orders: Chaminade College School to the north, Bishop Michael Power for boys and St. Joseph's Islington for girls to the west and Loretto College School to the east. Predominantly, Catholic children in York attended elementary schools in the Metropolitan Separate School Board and later attended public high schools such as York Memorial Collegiate Institute, Vaughan Road Collegiate Institute and George Harvey Collegiate Institute. When the province extended Roman Catholic high school funding beginning 1985, the MSSB began to search for an existing public school site in York. In May 1988, the Metropolitan Toronto School Board (MTSB) and YBE agreed to lease the York Humber High School on Humber Blvd.http://www.metropolicyarchive.ca/wp- content/uploads/2017/04/HSS-1146450-1988D_MSBT- Minutes-1988.pdfhttp://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2010/ex/bgrd/backgroundfile-32904.pdf On September 7, 1989, York's first Catholic high school, now known as Archbishop Romero Catholic Secondary School, opened its doors to 200 grade 9 students, 18 teachers and three support staff members. The new wing was erected in 1991 and constructions/alterations of the former York Humber building began in November 1992 costing at $12-million. The school was officially opened and blessed on May 7, 1995. With the namesake beatified in May 2015, the school was renamed to Blessed Archbishop Romero Catholic Secondary School shortly afterwards. After the canonization of Oscar Romero, it was renamed to St. Oscar Romero Catholic Secondary School on October 16, 2018.https://www.tcdsb.org/schools/stoscarromero/news/2018-2019/pages/renaming- of-school.aspx Chaplaincy All of Romero students are required to take a course in Religious Studies each year, but the faith formation does not end there as its chaplaincy program that organizes numerous and varied retreats for every grade level. As well, Romero's chaplaincy team provides many opportunities for their staff and students to continually develop their faith life through worship as a community both in small and large group settings. Being a Catholic community, they are committed to fostering the Christian values and principles inspired by their patron St. Oscar Romero. Academics and extra-curricular activities St. Oscar Romero is a semestered secondary school from grades 9‚Äì12. It offers various academic programs such as English, geography, mathematics, science, civics, history, and technological education in academic, applied or open levels.https://www.tcdsb.org/schools/StOscarRomero/Academics/Pages/default.aspx Since the turn of the 21st century, Romero's technological program consists of six computer labs, free Wi-fi, Chromebook and iPad labs, Macintosh lab for the media/communication technology program, and app courses. The school also offers an additional course for Grades 10 to 12 in applications and/or programming. It also has the woodworking shop located in the southwestern side of the school for its construction technology program.https://www.tcdsb.org/schools/StOscarRomero/Academics/Pages/Construction- Technology-SHSM.aspx Romero participates in many athletic programs under the \\"Romero Raiders\\" banner such as volleyball, basketball, golf, tennis, badminton and baseball as well as intramural sports.https://www.tcdsb.org/schools/StOscarRomero/Cocurricular/Athletics/Pages/default.aspx In addition, the school also offers many clubs and committees for students such as the Student Council (SAC), Romero Clean-Up, NYH Food Bank, Arts Alive (Romero's art show), Share Christmas BRINGO and several other clubs.https://www.tcdsb.org/schools/StOscarRomero/Cocurricular/Clubs/Pages/default.aspx See also *List of high schools in Ontario References External links * St. Oscar Romero Catholic Secondary School Category:Toronto Catholic District School Board Category:High schools in Toronto Category:Catholic secondary schools in Ontario Category:Educational institutions established in 1989 Category:Bill 30 schools Category:1989 establishments in Ontario Category:Brutalist architecture in Canada Category:Postmodern architecture in Canada ","title":"St. Oscar Romero Catholic Secondary School"},{"id":"13663535","text":"Ligota Wielka (German: Gro√ü Ellguth) is a village in the administrative district of Gmina ≈Åagiewniki, within Dzier≈ºoni√≥w County, Lower Silesian Voivodeship, in south-western Poland.

He commanded a British cavalry brigade under the Duke of Wellington during the Peninsular War and sat for many years as a Whig Member of Parliament. Early life Anson was the second son of George Adams (who changed the family surname to Anson by royal license on 30 April 1773) and his wife The Hon. Mary Vernon, daughter of the first Lord Vernon.The Annual Register, Or, A View of the History and Politics of the Year ‚Äì 1849, page 283, (Published 1850, J. G. & F.

Career =The Peninsular Wars and gaining of reputation= He entered the British Army in 1786 and served under the Duke of York and Sir Ralph Abercromby in Holland. It was to be in the Peninsular War where his reputation grew markedly. He served in all the campaigns between 1809 and 1813 and gained distinction in his command of the 16th Light Dragoons at the Second Battle of Porto. His reputation was further enhanced by his command of a brigade of light cavalry at the Battles of Talavera, Busaco, Salamanca and Vittoria.The Annual Register, Or, A View of the History and Politics of the Year ‚Äì 1849, page 284, (Published 1850, J. G. & F. Rivington) He also fought in the Battle of Venta del Pozo during the retreat from Burgos. For his services in the Battles of Talavera, Salamanca and Vittoria he received a medal and two clasps. So prominent was he during these campaigns that the House of Commons thanked him in November 1816 for his services generally during the Peninsular Wars. In August 1814, he was appointed to the colonelcy of the 23rd Regiment of (Light) Dragoons and in February 1827 to the colonelcy of the 4th Dragoon Guards. He was promoted to the rank of full general on 10 January 1837. =Outside conflict= Aside from his military career he also sat as Member of Parliament for Lichfield from 1806 to 1841. He was also the Groom of the Bedchamber to Prince Albert from 1836 to September 1841. In 1846 he was appointed the lieutenant-governor of the Royal Hospital, Chelsea and became governor in May 1849. Marriage and descendants Anson married Frances, daughter of John William Hamilton, in 1800. She was also the sister of Sir Frederick Hamilton. They had six sons and five daughters. Their son Talavera Vernon Anson became an Admiral in the Royal Navy. Another son, Thomas Anson, was a first-class cricketer. Their daughter Julia married Sir Arthur Brinsley Brooke and served as a lady in waiting to Queen Victoria. Lady Anson died in 1834. Anson survived her by fifteen years and died at the Royal Hospital, Chelsea, in November 1849. In Who Do You Think You Are?, transmitted on the BBC on 18 October 2007, it was discovered that Sir Matthew Pinsent, the multiple gold medal Olympic rower, is a direct descendant of Sir George Anson.

It operated about the same time as the Tiwanaku culture and at one time was thought to have been derived from it. In 2008 archeologists found a prehistoric city, the Northern Wari ruins, also called Cerro P√°tapo, near modern Chiclayo. The find was the first to show an extensive settlement related to the Wari culture that far north and demonstrate that they had a long span of influence. Debate on \\"empire\\" label Some scholars in the field debate whether the Wari communities can be termed an \\"empire\\". For instance, the archaeologist Ruth Shady has suggested the society could better be considered a loose economic network of Wari centres. Scholars who contend the society did constitute an empire include William Isbell, Katherine Schreiber and Luis Lumbreras. They note its construction of an extensive network of roadways linking provincial cities, as well as the construction of complex, characteristic architecture in its major centres, some of which were quite extensive. Leaders had to plan projects and organize large amounts of labor to accomplish such projects.Katharine Schreiber, \\"Wari Empire - Excavations at Wari, Ayachucho, Peru\\", JRank, accessed 3 Nov 2010 The discovery in early 2013 of an undisturbed, imperial royal tomb, El Castillo de Huarmey, provides evidence of the material wealth and political power exercised by the Wari for centuries. The discovery of three royal women's bodies and their burial wealth plus the accompanying sixty bodies demonstrates a culture with the material wealth, political power, and administrative apparatus to provide extended veneration of the royal dead. Political relations The Wari Empire was a second-generation state of the Andean region; both it and Tiwanaku had been preceded by the first-generation Moche state. When expanding to engulf new polities, the Wari Empire practiced a policy of allowing the local leaders of the newly acquired territory to retain control of their area if they agreed to join the Wari empire and obey the Wari. The Wari required mit'a labor (non-reciprocal public labor for the state) of its subjects as a form of tribute. Mit'a laborers were involved in the construction of buildings at the Wari capital and in the provinces. The political relationship between the Wari and Tiwanaku has been compared by archaeologist Joyce Marcus to that of the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War: the two empires did not go to war with one another for fear of mutual destruction. The two empires met at Moquegua, where the Wari and Tiwanaku populations co-existed without conflicts. Administration While the Wari likely had significant organizational and administrative power, it remains unclear what the origins of its political and artistic forms were. Emerging evidence suggests that rather than being the result of Tiwanaku traits diffusing north, the Wari and Tiwanaku ideological formations may be traceable to previous developments at Pukara, an Early Intermediate Period culture to the north of Lake Titicaca. The polity seems to have survived until ca. AD 1100, when it collapsed, likely as a result of both environmental change and internal socio-political stresses.

This segregation process occurs during both mitosis and meiosis. Chromosome segregation also occurs in prokaryotes. However, in contrast to eukaryotic chromosome segregation, replication and segregation are not temporally separated. Instead segregation occurs progressively following replication. Mitotic chromatid segregation Mitosis divides the chromosomes in a cell nucleus. During mitosis chromosome segregation occurs routinely as a step in cell division (see mitosis diagram). As indicated in the mitosis diagram, mitosis is preceded by a round of DNA replication, so that each chromosome forms two copies called chromatids. These chromatids separate to opposite poles, a process facilitated by a protein complex referred to as cohesin. Upon proper segregation, a complete set of chromatids ends up in each of two nuclei, and when cell division is completed, each DNA copy previously referred to as a chromatid is now called a chromosome. Meiotic chromosome and chromatid segregation Chromosome segregation occurs at two separate stages during meiosis called anaphase I and anaphase II (see meiosis diagram). In a diploid cell there are two sets of homologous chromosomes of different parental origin (e.g. a paternal and a maternal set). During the phase of meiosis labeled ‚Äúinterphase s‚Äù in the meiosis diagram there is a round of DNA replication, so that each of the chromosomes initially present is now composed of two copies called chromatids. These chromosomes (paired chromatids) then pair with the homologous chromosome (also paired chromatids) present in the same nucleus (see prophase I in the meiosis diagram). The process of alignment of paired homologous chromosomes is called synapsis (see Synapsis). During synapsis, genetic recombination usually occurs. Some of the recombination events occur by crossing over (involving physical exchange between two chromatids), but most recombination events involve information exchange but not physical exchange between two chromatids (see Synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA)). Following recombination, chromosome segregation occurs as indicated by the stages metaphase I and anaphase I in the meiosis diagram. Different pairs of chromosomes segregate independently of each other, a process termed ‚Äúindependent assortment of non-homologous chromosomes‚Äù. This process results in each gamete usually containing a mixture of chromosomes from both original parents. Improper chromosome segregation can result in aneuploid gametes having either too few or too many chromosomes. The second stage at which segregation occurs during meiosis is prophase II (see meiosis diagram). During this stage, segregation occurs by a process similar to that during mitosis, except that in this case prophase II is not preceded by a round of DNA replication. Thus the two chromatids comprising each chromosome separate into different nuclei, so that each nucleus gets a single set of chromatids (now called chromosomes) and each nucleus becomes included in a haploid gamete (see stages following prophase II in the meiosis diagram). This segregation process is also facilitated by cohesin. Failure of proper segregation during prophase II can also lead to aneuploid gametes. Aneuploid gametes can undergo fertilization to form aneuploid zygotes and hence to serious adverse consequences for progeny. Crossovers facilitate segregation, but are not essential A diagram of the meiotic phases A current model of meiotic recombination, initiated by a double-strand break or gap, followed by pairing with an homologous chromosome and strand invasion to initiate the recombinational repair process. Repair of the gap can lead to crossover (CO) or non-crossover (NCO) of the flanking regions. CO recombination is thought to occur by the Double Holliday Junction (DHJ) model, illustrated on the right, above. NCO recombinants are thought to occur primarily by the Synthesis Dependent Strand Annealing (SDSA) model, illustrated on the left, above. Most recombination events appear to be the SDSA type. Meiotic chromosomal crossover (CO) recombination facilitates the proper segregation of homologous chromosomes. This is because, at the end of meiotic prophase I, CO recombination provides a physical link that holds homologous chromosome pairs together. These linkages are established by chiasmata, which are the cytological manifestations of CO recombination. Together with cohesion linkage between sister chromatids, CO recombination may help ensure the orderly segregation of the paired homologous chromosomes to opposite poles. In support of this, a study of aneuploidy in single spermatozoa by whole genome sequencing found that, on average, human sperm cells with aneuploid autosomes exhibit significantly fewer crossovers than normal cells. After the first chromosome segregation in meiosis I is complete, there is further chromosome segregation during the second equational division of meiosis II. Both proper initial segregation of chromosomes in prophase I and the next chromosome segregation during equational division in meiosis II are required to generate gametes with the correct number of chromosomes. CO recombinants are produced by a process involving the formation and resolution of Holliday junction intermediates. As indicated in the figure titled \\"A current model of meiotic recombination\\", the formation of meiotic crossovers can be initiated by a double-strand break (DSB). The introduction of DSBs in DNA often employs the topoisomerase-like protein SPO11. CO recombination may also be initiated by external sources of DNA damage such as X-irradiation, or internal sources. There is evidence that CO recombination facilitates meiotic chromosome segregation. Other studies, however, indicate that chiasma, while supportive, are not essential to meiotic chromosome segregation. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a model organism used for studying meiotic recombination. Mutants of S. cerevisiae defective in CO recombination at the level of Holliday junction resolution were found to efficiently undergo proper chromosome segregation. The pathway that produces the majority of COs in S. cerevisiae, and possibly in mammals, involves a complex of proteins including the MLH1-MLH3 heterodimer (called MutL gamma). MLH1-MLH3 binds preferentially to Holliday junctions. It is an endonuclease that makes single-strand breaks in supercoiled double-stranded DNA, and promotes the formation of CO recombinants. Double mutants deleted for both MLH3 (major pathway) and MMS4 (which is necessary for a minor Holliday junction resolution pathway) showed dramatically reduced crossing over compared to wild-type (6- to 17-fold reduction); however spore viability was reasonably high (62%) and chromosomal disjunction appeared mostly functional. The MSH4 and MSH5 proteins form a hetero-oligomeric structure (heterodimer) in S. cerevisiae and humans. In S. cerevisiae, MSH4 and MSH5 act specifically to facilitate crossovers between homologous chromosomes during meiosis. The MSH4/MSH5 complex binds and stabilizes double Holliday junctions and promotes their resolution into crossover products. An MSH4 hypomorphic (partially functional) mutant of S. cerevisiae showed a 30% genome-wide reduction in crossover numbers, and a large number of meioses with non-exchange chromosomes. Nevertheless, this mutant gave rise to spore viability patterns suggesting that segregation of non-exchange chromosomes occurred efficiently. Thus it appears that CO recombination facilitates proper chromosome segregation during meiosis in S. cerevisiae, but it is not essential. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe has the ability to segregate homologous chromosomes in the absence of meiotic recombination (achiasmate segregation). This ability depends on the microtubule motor dynein that regulates the movement of chromosomes to the poles of the meiotic spindle.

She was used by the Navy to patrol navigable waterways of the Confederacy to prevent the South from trading with other countries. Dawn ‚Äî a screw steamer ‚Äî was built in 1857 by Samuel Sneden, New York City; chartered on 26 April 1861 and purchased on 12 October 1861; outfitted at New York Navy Yard; and commissioned on 9 May 1861, Commander W. Chandler in command. Assigned to the Potomac Flotilla Assigned to duty with the Potomac Flotilla, Dawn sailed from New York on 11 May and took station at the mouth of the York River on blockade duty until 24 September. During this time, she captured three ships with contraband goods and passengers on board. After repairs at Washington Navy Yard, she was sent up the Rappahannock River on blockade duty in November. Reassigned to the South Atlantic Blockade Dawn had a new boiler installed at New York Navy Yard from 7 February-27 April 1862, then stood out for Port Royal, South Carolina, for service with the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. Arriving on station on 14 May, she patrolled the coastal and inland waters of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, frequently exchanging fire with enemy shore batteries, and joining in the attacks on Fort McAllister of 27 January-1 February 1863. She also assisted in the capture of several blockade runners, including the Confederate privateer Nashville with a valuable cargo of cotton.

On 24 May 1864, she was influential in the defence of Wilson's Wharf, Virginia near Charles City. The wharf's garrison of 1,100 USCT under the command of Brigadier General Edward A. Wild was assaulted by 2,500 Confederate cavalrymen under the command of Major General Fitzhugh Lee. Between the stout resistance of the USCT troops and the Dawns guns, the Confederates were driven back. Wilson's Wharf and the soon to be completed Fort Pocahontas remained in Union hands for the duration of the war.

Harvard University Press) The Nature of Mass Poverty The nature of mass poverty Galbraith, J.K. Cambridge, Mass. (USA) Harvard Univ. Press 1979 Originally given as lectures at the Graduate Institute of International Studies, University of Geneva and at Radcliffe Institute; is an economics book by John Kenneth Galbraith published in 1979, in which Galbraith draws on his experiences as ambassador to India to explain the causes for and solutions to poverty. He begins by differentiating so-called \\"case poverty\\" of individuals (as detailed years earlier in The Affluent Society) from \\"mass poverty\\", largely observed in rural areas of the developing world. Galbraith discusses a variety of different explanations for poverty, e.g. climate, mountains, access to harbours, raw materials, culture or political system. A typical example is his comparison of two train journeys in eastern Europe in 1860 and 1960. He points out that the effect of communism on economics was rather limited‚Äîthe train basically being the same, the relative differences in economic status kept unchanged as well, (eastern) Germany and Czechoslovakia leading and Romania being the last. The same applies to Asia, where \\"being Chinese\\" had a greater effect on local wealth than climate or local political system. Galbraith then lays out two arguments with regards to mass poverty. First, he contends that many of the causes attributed to the conditions of the rural poor (governmental corruption, lack of education) are in fact both a cause and effect of poverty. The poor being perfectly adapted to their labour-intensive work, an accommodation to poverty makes this culturally ingrained and the poor and their offspring tend to stay in that vicious circle. Galbraith points out that most solutions to poverty from the West (capital investment, improved organization and technology, increased agricultural production) are those the developed nations can provide‚Äîbut often fail to consider local accommodation to poverty (compare Axelle Kabou). Drawing on his observations in postwar Western Germany, which faced an enormous amount of displaced persons after the war, he concludes that emigration was not a problem but in combination with the high level of education, it contributed significantly to the economic success and reconstruction effort. Galbraith recommends for India improvement in general education on the one hand and focused help for those determined to escape the cycle of poverty. In general, as for developed countries, emigration and embracing other cultures are not seen as a problem but a sign of action and willingness to escape unsustainable status. The more literate and informed a population, the more influences and cultures they have available as role models, and the more motivated its members are to escape perpetual poverty. His primary Indian example is the Punjab region, a crossroads of trade and different cultural influences where the ambition to maintain high levels of literacy and education and the local mixture of Sikh, Hindu, and Muslim cultures accelerated economic growth relative to poorer southern provinces.

Debt relief orders are suitable for debtors who have relatively low liabilities, little surplus income and few assets; can (depending on eligibility) be a viable alternative to other insolvency measures, such as Individual Voluntary Arrangements (IVAs), and when bankruptcy would be disproportionate; and allow vulnerable people trapped in debt to have a fresh start. It is possible to apply for a DRO without attending court and the fee is ¬£90. The fee may be paid by installments prior to applying for the order.  Background  Debt relief orders were introduced under Chapter 4 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007, as a major amendment to the Insolvency Act 1986, and minor amendments to the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 and the Employment Rights Act 1996. In Schedule 20 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007, the consequences of debt relief orders is outlined. Consequences of the amendments to the Insolvency Act 1986 include: * Bankruptcy or eligibility for a debt relief order could be determined by a third party intermediary; * Debt relief orders were outlined as a voluntary process which third party mediators could not intermediary; * Debt relief orders can be revoked if the ¬£90 application fee is not paid; * Individuals who successfully complete a DRO process are not eligible for Parliament for 12 months; * Additional restrictions to individuals who complete a DRO process outlined; * Individuals who are dead are exempt from DRO protections; * A register of DROs established, can be inspected by the public; * Punishments for abuse of DRO process for monetary gain of an individual and/or organisation outlined. Consequences of the amendments to the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 include: * An individual directly or indirectly promoting, establishing, or managing a company during the period of DRO restrictions is an offence (punishment defined as the same as for that offence under bankruptcy restrictions). Consequences of the amendments to the Employment Rights Act 1996 include: * An employer is defined as being insolvent during the period of DRO restrictions. The Minimal Asset Protection (MAP) insolvency measure, introduced in Scotland under the Bankruptcy and Debt Advice (Scotland) Bill on 11 June 2013, shares similarities with DROs but has different associated benefits, risks, and fees. In particular, the application cost was reduced from ¬£90 to ¬£50 during the COVID-19 pandemic (until September 31st 2020) in response to increased financial insecurity. Eligibility Debt relief orders are intended to provide debt relief for people in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland if: * the debtor is unable to pay his/her debts; * the debtor's total unsecured liabilities (debt) must not exceed ¬£20,000; * the debtor's total gross assets must not exceed ¬£1000 (this includes houses so homeowners will not be eligible; the debtor will usually be allowed to keep a car if it is worth less than ¬£1000 or it has been adapted for them because they have a physical impairment that has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on their ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities; * the debtor's disposable income, following deduction of normal household expenses, must not exceed ¬£50 per month; * the debtor must be domiciled in England or Wales, or in the last 3 years have been resident or carrying on business in England or Wales; * the debtor must not have previously been subject to a DRO within the last 6 years; * the debtor must not be involved in another formal insolvency procedure at the time of application for a DRO, such as: ** an undischarged bankrupt; ** a current individual voluntary arrangement; ** A current bankruptcy restrictions order or undertaking; ** A current debt relief restrictions order or undertaking; ** An interim order; ** A current pending debtor's bankruptcy petition in relation to the debtor but the debtor has not been referred to the DRO procedure by the court as a more suitable method of debt relief; ** A current pending creditor's bankruptcy petition against the debtor but the debtor has not obtained the creditor's permission for entry into the DRO process. Application Process A debt relief order is a form of insolvency, like bankruptcy, and will be subject to a public listing through the Insolvency Service website. Debt relief orders can only be completed by an approved intermediary and competent authorities. Approved intermediaries will be mainly experienced debt advisors attached to debt advice organisations such as Citizens Advice, StepChange Debt Charity or an AdviceUK member. The approved intermediary can review the persons information, make a determination that they are eligible and appropriate for a DRO and file the DRO application online. Approved intermediaries will not charge a fee for completing or submitting an application. Organisations approved by the Insolvency Service as competent authorities are listed on the Insolvency Service web site, and include, Angel Advance, AdviceUK, Citizens Advice, StepChange Debt Charity, the Institute of Money Advisers, National Debtline, Payplan and Think Money. Upon receipt of the application and payment of the fee, an Official Receiver may make the order, administratively, without the involvement of the court if it appears that the applicant meets the requirements. If the Official Receiver becomes aware of information which means the debtor does not qualify for a DRO, the application will be refused. If this information comes to light after the DRO is made, the Official Receiver may revoke the DRO without reference to the Court. The effect of revoking a DRO will be to leave the debtor open to actions by his or her creditors. If a DRO is revoked the debtor cannot apply for another one within six years. Outcomes During the 12-month period that a debt relief order is active, the applicant will: * Be protected from enforcement action by the creditors included in the application (bar certain creditors whose debts cannot be scheduled in the DRO and those creditors whose debts are included in the DRO but who have successfully obtained leave from the court to pursue their debts). * Be free from those debts at the end of the period (normally 12 months from Order). * Be obliged to provide information to and co-operate with the Official Receiver. * Be expected to make arrangements to repay their creditors should their financial circumstances improve. Certain activities by debtors subject to a DRO may result in an application to the Court for a Debt Relief Restrictions Order being refused. These include: * Failing to keep records which account for a loss of property by the debtor, or by a business carried on by him, where the loss occurred in the period beginning two years before the application date for the debt relief order and ending with the date of the application for the debt relief restrictions order; * Failing to produce records of that kind on demand by the official receiver; * Entering into a transaction at an undervalue in the period beginning two years before the application date for the debt relief order and ending with the date of the determination of that application; * Giving a preference in the period beginning two years before the application date for the debt relief order and ending with the date of the determination of that application; * Making an excessive pension contribution; * A failure to supply goods or services that were wholly or partly paid for; * Trading at a time, before the date of the determination of the application for the debt relief order, when the debtor knew or ought to have known that he was himself to be unable to pay his debts; * Incurring, before the date of the determination of the application for the debt relief order, a debt which the debtor had no reasonable expectation of being able to pay; * Failing to account satisfactorily to the court or the official receiver for a loss of property or for an insufficiency of property to meet his debts; * Carrying on any gambling, rash and hazardous speculation or unreasonable extravagance which may have materially contributed to or increased the extent of his inability to pay his debts before the application date for the debt relief order or which took place between that date and the date of the determination of the application for the debt relief order; * Neglect of business affairs of a kind which may have materially contributed to or increased the extent of his inability to pay his debts; * Fraud or fraudulent breach of trust; * Failing to co-operate with the official receiver. In addition certain more serious misconduct may result in criminal prosecution. Data released in November 2014 shows the number of debt relief orders in London between 2009 and 2013 was much lower than the average for the rest of England. The study was produced by New Policy Institute and funded by Trust for London.

The aim of these conferences was to discuss and to make public studies dealing with matters of antiquity and ethnography. The Conferences were hosted by a different city of the Russian Empire every three years. The Third Archeological Congress was held in Kiev in 1873 and featured the renowned kobzar - Ostap Veresai. In 1902 the XIIth Archeological Congress was held in Kharkiv. By that time Ostap Veresai had died and ethnographers had come to the mistaken conclusion that he was the last kobzar. Bandurist Hnat Khotkevych was invited to give a presentation at the Congress. He organized a concert to demonstrate the various studies which included the performance by a number of kobzars from a number of regions of Ukraine. The concert was extremely successful and changed the status of the kobzars who up till then were persecuted by the Russian tsarist authorities treated as common street beggars. The XIIIth Archeological Congress took place in Katerynoslav in 1905. Interest in the performance of the kobzari was very high. Attempts to repeat the performance of the kobzars at the XIIth Congress were not successful. It was attended by Tereshko Parkhomenko and two other kobzars.  The Twelfth Congress  The XIIth all-Russian Archeological Congress that took place from August 14‚Äì27, 1902. It took on an epochal importance, which is worthy of more detailed investigation. Initially the scientific community in Ukraine became interested in the art of the kobzars in 1873, when the matter of the Poltava kobzar Ostap Veresai was raised at a special meeting of the South-Western chapter of the Russian Imperial Geographic Society. Apart from a number of papers presented regarding the kobzar, the participants also had the chance to listen to his renditions. The performance of the 70-year-old kobzar left a great impression on the participants. = The decision to focus on the legacy of the kobzars = The next set of Archeological Conferences, were organized outside of Ukraine, and the matter of kobzar art was not discussed. The XIIth Archeological Congress however was planned to take place in Kharkiv - a region that was a major hub for kobzar art. This was one of the reasons why the art of kobzars was included in the program of the proceedings. There are indications that professor M. Dashkovych, the head of the Nestor the Chronicler Society, made the suggestion that the conference focus its attention to the art of the kobzars. The organizational committee of the conference was led by Kharkiv University professor and noted ethnographer M. Sumtsov who decided to liven up the discussions and papers about the kobzars with the inclusion of live performances. The committee turned to Hnat Khotkevych to co-ordinate the performances during the conference and to also give a short paper on the current state of the art form. Khotkevych agreed whole-heartedly. He used the forum to turn the participants awareness to the difficult lifestyle of these blind folk musicians and the persecution they underwent from the local police. = Preparation of the kobzars = For the conference six kobzars were invited; four from the regions around Kharkiv: Petro Drevchenko, Pavlo Hashchenko, Ivan Kuchuhura Kucherenko, Hrytsko Netesa; one from Poltava province; Mykhailo Kravchenko; and one from Chernihiv province: Terentiy Parkhomenko. To this group of six were added three lirnyks. Later, in order to balance the voices which had a tendency of being made up exclusively of basses (apart from Parkhomenko who was a tenor), a local street singer was invited. He usually performed without an instrument, however, knew the repertoire of the kobzars. (It was not possible then to find a kobzar in the Kharkiv environs who sang tenor). All the participants were housed in one of the university buildings - a basement which was dry and warm where preparations took place. On the first day, as Khotkevych would write, each of the participants became acquainted with each other. Initially they showed off what each knew how to sing and play. > The demonstrations started with the host group from Kharkiv. They were very > nervous. It is noteworthy that each of them was an artist, and had become > used to performing in front of various audiences. But this was at bazaars, > marketplaces and dwellings. But here was a new environment, a different > auditorium made up of other kobzars - all of which had become very agitated. > After the Kharkiv kobzars finished performing, it was M. Kravchenko's turn > from Poltava. His music and method of performance was the most artistic of > all the participants, but... Mykhailo did not receive the highest honours at > that gathering of blind minnesingers. The simple-minded auditorium, even > though it was made up exclusively of musicians, enjoys performances that are > loud, bright and confident, These characteristics were heard in the > performance by the Chernihiv kobzar. > \\"So that is how you play .... we play like this!\\" So saying he struck his > strings. His bandura was huge, the method he used to play was totally > different from that of the Kharkiv players (a form of tremolo in thirds, > where the fingers move in the direction of the finger pads, and then the > direction of the nail). A high clear tenor, confidence in himself and on top > of this a song that stunned the listeners. And thus Terentiy Parkhomenko was > acclaimed as the best kobzar of the gathering.

This was the first > time that these blind men had played in such a large group. Those who sat on > the right flank, could not hear the person sitting on the left flank. The > orchestral members could not see the conductor, so there is no way of > correcting problems during the performance. We had to learn all the pieces > to perfection, which we did. There has been some discussion in recent times as to the amount in which Khotkevych had interfered with the kobzars \\"authentic\\" performances. His paper and his methodology was thought of as being invasive of the traditional art form. However, had he not taken such a stand it is possible that traditional bandura playing would have disappeared much earlier, and contemporary bandura playing may not have happened. The program included solo performances, duets, trios and other ensembles, something akin to an orchestra of folk instruments. The group of kobzars and lirnyky was supplemented by a traditional folk ensemble known as a \\"troyista myzyky\\" (two violins and a cello), which were invited to participate from the village of Derkachi. This meeting during the conference, which officially was called \\"the Conference of the 2nd division of the historic-geographic and ethnographic antiquities\\", took place in the public library. The higher administration of the city as well as the governor were also invited. The meeting was opened by the chairman of the conference, professor of the University of Kharkiv - A. Krasnov. In his opening address he noted: \\"the collection of folk songs is difficult, because such a collector required not only the understanding of the regional ethnography and a keen sense of observation, but also had to have musical training in order to correctly notate the song, and to correctly recreate it. The final task is particularly difficult, so this conference decided to take an easier route, and to hear the performance of these works by the carriers of this music directly, in this case from the kobzars and lirnyks .... To this live antiquity, which is gradually disappearing, the conference is dedicated. \\" A short paper \\"About the kobzars and lirnyks of the Kharkiv province\\" was read by professor M. Sumtsov. After this was another short paper - \\"The association of the blind, their organization and current state\\" which was read by V. Ivanov. He completed the reading with the following word: \\"The nelips -(that is what he called the blind singer-kobzars) this is live walking archeology. Let us all preserve the clean and good, and disregard all that which is bad and offensive. People sometimes can be born blind but no-one is born a beggar. Begging is an offensive industry. Let us wish our singers recognition for their humanity and dignity. Let a person born blind continue to be a man.\\" = Khotkevych's presentation = The final paper before the concert was read by Hnat Khotkevych. It was read out, \\"in a manner unusual for an Archeological meeting, and for the members of the ultra-polite academics in general.\\" The second section of the paper, which was dedicated to the persecution and oppression of the kobzars by the organs of the state administration was considerably severe. The main points of the paper were such: \\"Almost every nation, particularly on the European continent, gave music a divine source. It is certain that people did not look upon it as a form of unsophisticated culture. The general thought was that music was the thread that unites human beings with the unknown beauties of this world, far from hustle and bustle of daily life. They say that only the old and the young say the truth - and it is certain: civilization in the early times called music: \\"the language of the gods.\\" Unfortunately we are currently in a state, we can say a more adult state, or a more mature state, and for us music is a method \\"pour passer le temps\\". Even professional people \\"do not understand what they create.\\" One can expect, that in time when humanity grows more mature and rather than instinctively, they will through derived knowledge move music to its proper place in society, where it again will become a heavenly divine gift, worthy of adoration. \\"The singer does not sing from himself, this gift was given him by Zeus\\" is what is stated in the Odyssey. And our Ukrainian rhapsodies even today, despite the musical and moral degeneration, have preserved within themselves the concept that they are the people that should elevate the ethical life of the people to a higher level, singing occasionally for their listeners religious-moral materials from the past. As an example, Kulish wrote that the kobzar Andriy Shut thought that the profession of a kobzar is a matter of salvation, because the kobzar exists to remind people about God and about benevolence and charity. The genealogical tree of our Ukrainian bandurists is very high. Its direct ancestor was the prophetic Boyan-- \\"the nightingale of ancient times\\" As the people developed and changed, so did the expression of their spirit. The Boyan, in the past a pagan priest, a wizard, a foretell of supernatural events, was all-mighty and wise, a leader of the people, an indicator of the direction one's life would take or an advisor to the tsar; later an organ for the statement of community feeling, a rhapsody of heroic epics and an igniter of national ferment for the lifting of national spirit and self-awareness‚Äîhe has only now, in recent times been reborn in the guise of a blind beggar, who puts up with hunger and cold on the beaten path and believes more in his unhappy lot, than the sound of his poor instrument. We have little information about the early period of the musical life of our people unfortunately, but still history has left us with these singer- rhapsodies with unblemished epic purity, as if they were the true carriers of truth, the singers of heroic deeds, fed and inspired the folk masses. Shevyriov wrote about the Boyan: \\"He knew well his poetic destiny, he was a singer of independence and easily put together songs in the praise of princes, not giving up his inspiration for anyone else.\\" All this can be applied to the moral face of our old kozak bandurist. It should be considered, that this rich period of Ukrainian history allowed itself to be distorted by all sides, and in particular the musical dissipations of the people. In those times all Kozaks were bandurists. The kozak era was a very generous era for the creation of songs. The folk lived in all is fibres; happiness and sadness were intertwined and influenced every soul. There was no rest for the nerves, and artistic souls always found a way to express themselves. A so it was: in this period a huge body of songs and dumy were created; women would poetically speak about their feelings, Kozaks sang about war and chivalry. One can be assured that on a rich soil would grow fantastic fruit‚Äîfolk poet-rhapsodies, genius bandurists: these are the creators of these songs and dumy. Then came the destruction of the Sich, feudalism - and the people felt the full weight of Moscovy's hand. All who stood in its way were quashed. This persecution did not evade the kobzar. In captivity he no longer became a singer of the Kozaks, because they no longer existed. Now he sang only about the past, which was sacred to the Ukrainian soul. Years passed and the retelling of stories of the past began to disappear one by one from the memory of the people. Life took on different forms, and that which interested the folk in the past slowly lost its value. Because of this so did the bandurists. One after the other they began to forget dumy, and gradually became accustomed to their new conditions of existence. Today in front of us we have the contemporary kobzar and lirnyk, the contemporary carrier of the richness of folk song. Let us investigate what this is. He is known to all of us, the contemporary singer. He comes into our courtyards, scratches something out on the lira or plucks something out on the bandura, and they give him a scrap of bread. He bows down and thanks the people, and goes on to the next building,..... and that is all‚Äîa blindman, a beggar and that is it. But there is more to him, than this. Firstly the bandurists disdregard the fact that the Kozaks are now gone and will never return. They do not consider the fact that the previous way of life will never return. The Kobzars are still are a repository of the memory of the past‚Äîeach of them knowing a number of dumy, and ancient kozak songs. About the kobzars of the Chernihiv province I would like to say somewhat more, because this is a new type of bandurist, who is being currently formed and has a great future. This is Terentiy Makarovych Parkhomenko, from the Chernihiv province, Sosnytsia region, from the settlement of Burkivka, (which is pronounced by the Chernihivites Bourkwuwka). He is 30 years old and initially studied from Andriy Haidenko. Haidenko in his turn learned the kobzar art from some old man named Danylo. Terentiy however had not managed to learn any dumy at all from his teacher, nor from his friends. \\"No matter how much horilka I gave them, nothing would come out\\" he states. In the meantime, Tereshko wanted to learn dumy very badly; something called out to his soul and I have not seen a bandurist who would listen with such interest to historic songs and dumy, like this Parkhomenko. And that drive to learn about the past did not end without results. He met up with various Ukrainian intellectuals, who as a result of his queries about dumy, purchased books and songbooks. He chose a literate lead boy specifically in order to have him read out the texts of dumy and historic songs. \\"I came to the conference not so much to be a participant, but more so to learn something\\"‚Äîhe told me. Now he knows nine dumy, many historic songs (one of theme about Morozenko he will perform this evening). Taking the motives for his songs from the intelligentsia who can write and print, Terentiy does not step into the art form blindly. Despite using modes and scales which are not traditional, he adds to them his individuality, and returns them from forgotteness into live performance. He inserts into them a lost feeling, so that the song in this rendition does not have a bookish feeling. In such a manner in this bandurist we can observe that the intelligentsia has begun to return the borrowed treasures, and although it was not looked after very well, it was indeed saved for posterity. Let God grant Terentiy the fulfillment of his wishes‚Äîthe future is his. I will say a few words about the extinction of the kobzars. In the general public there exists a well-established thought that Ostap Veresai was the last of the Ukrainian Bandurists. This is an erroneous idea; the kobzars, are not dying out, and if they are, are doing so very, very slowly. I did not do a systematic inquire about live kobzars, but I do have the following statistics; in Kharkiv province in the Bohodukhiv and Akhtyrka region live 28 bandurists and 37 lirnyks. The Chernihiv bandurist stated, that he knows in the Sosnytsia region and in the surrounding areas 9 kobzars and 15 lirnyks, and such figures can indicate many things‚Äîbut do not indicate extinction in anyway. Finally I would like to raise the matter about the persecution of the kobzars by local town and village administrators. Once upon a time one of the major concerns of the orthodox clergy was the \\"persecution of lay singers of songs, the players of music, dancers and acrobats.\\" In those times they were sure \\"the husli would make sound - and just as bees are chased out by smoke - so are angels of God chased out by such music, and such cacophony makes the devil happy.\\" Apart from this, they believed that music was one of the main problems in the country, and that \\"it is worth incarcerating in the name of God and to punish such law breakers.\\" It is not unusual that the government mirroring the actions of the clerics \\"attempted to destroy this accursed devil worship\\". Even the \\"quiet spoken\\" Tsar Oleksiy Mykhailovych sent out a draconian proclamation \\"to destroy the instruments of the skomorokhy, and to beat them with sticks without mercy\\" and their innocent \\"surmas, drums and domras are to be broken up to the last and to be thrown into the fire.\\" But at that time everything was possible.... What can one think when even today, after many centuries they are \\"beating musicians\\" but this time not the skomorokhy, but the unfortunate blind Ukrainian bandurists. What can one think when they destroy their simple instruments? This is not a rhetorical formula: two years ago one of the bandurists came to me in tears. What had happened? A simple matter: his kobza was smashed against a post by some police officer and the unfortunate blindman had lost his last method of earning an income. Just 30 years ago, the eminent Mr. Rusov at the meeting of the South-western section of the Imperial Russian Geographic Society stated, that this blindman was difficult to tell apart from a standard beggar, and no-one paid any attention to these words. It is easy to differentiate: A beggar can work but does not, but the blindman wants to work but cannot. Each of them apart from playing his instrument, tries to learn some sort of trade: one plies ropes, another weaves baskets a third makes nets. The kobzar Mykhailo Kravchenko for example stated: \\"When you wind those ropes for a month or two, twenty layers of skin peel off your fingers.\\" Another of the bandurists present can ring church bells very well. Tears form in his eyes when he recounts how he once came slightly late to take up his position as the bell ringer in one of the churches in his village. \\"Now there is a sighted person - he states - but a sighted person can find many other tasks to do.\\" It is the true that he does not want to be pictured as being lazy. He wanders from house to house, adhering to those laws which apply to us all which no-one opposes. He needs only to feed his hunger. But maybe this fundamental need is a crime, as one of the blind kobzars O. Bar stated: \\" Eh - what happens when one comes across one of those city dwellers, government officials, civil servants etc.! He'll tear the strings on your bandura, and he will threaten to smash your instrument, and if you argue with him - he'll box in your sides - just don't walk around.\\" ...\\" Where will I, your eminence, get that piece of daily bread? It is understood that no-one will bring it to me at my home?\\" \\"Such it is, die, but do not wander round here, because it is forbidden.\\" And this is not a rare occurrence, but unfortunately, a chronic one, which has been occurring for many tens of years. \\"So we hide from them - says Kravchenko - as if we, let God forgive, are some sort of criminals or something. When we hear that one is coming or riding, you turn away in any direction, and often you may fall, just in order that this misfortune passes you by. So what sort of times have come: young Jews can walk around with barrel organs, and they are allowed, even those who are so loud that you can hear the noise through the whole neighborhood, but here we sing about God, we turn people away from sin - no that is not allowed.\\" A characteristic answer by the kobzar Mykhailo Kravchenko when he was asked before traveling to Saint Petersburg: \\"Well Uncle Mykhailo, if you were able to sing in front of the Tsar like that biliny singer Riabinin - what would you say to him?\\" To this the blindman answered - \\"For me personally, I need nothing, and if the Lord God made it so that I would indeed have a chance to speak to his eminence the Tsar, I would ask that he allow my brothers to walk freely everywhere\\". To such statements comments are superfluous. How to understand and clarify for oneself such persecution - I do not know, but I feel that no one else but men of science should turn their attention to it, because not only the bandurists have to put up with such persecution, but also science. Organizations are created for the collection of ethnographic materials, but what will they collect if, all these kobzars \\" \\"throw out from their heads\\" all their song riches. Mykhailo Kravchenko for example has already forgotten a number of dumy, not being able to expect any improvement of matters, he has prematurely uttered incantations to himself that have meant the premature death of himself and his music. But the bandurists themselves? Many of them have to starve, not only by themselves but with their families -because that unlucky kobza or lira which was the only breadwinner of many mouths. Beaten by nature itself, and placed in a position in which it is impossible to fight for the elements of life - what do they think of the need for their art when their bandura is smashed against a post? We become angry when thickheaded sons of landowners shoot at crosses placed on kozak burial mounds; we get even more upset when we discover that some unsophisticated people are killing off some nice birds somewhere, we write books, read lectures - why do we not take to this matter, when the same thing is happening with live people .... a kobzar - this is the same good bird, feeding itself it does good for those around him - and to science, passing on good in their dumas and psalms. Let us look after and conserve these good singing birds!.... Let us expect that the XIIth Archeological conference will not leave their work just at a discussion, but will make inquiries to the higher administration. In such a manner each of the people present can help our Ukrainian kobzars with their kind words.\\" Such an open accusation to the government, spoken out with young hot-headedness and at such a large gathering of people in the conference hall, and in front of the governor and high police officials, was unheard of, and no-one could expect to know how this would end up, had not the concert of these above mentioned kobzars discussed by the orator started up immediately. The concert was so unique and made such a huge impression on everyone, in particular those in high administration, that if anyone wanted to take up the matter against the daring free thinking orator, such ideas were neutralized by the concert. All that happened as a consequence was that such a \\"free thinking\\" paper was not included in the publication of the \\"Conference papers\\". = The kobzar concert = The Kobzar enemble at the XIIth Archeological Conference in Kharkiv in 1902. The program of the concert was made up of two sections. In the first were historic pieces. # The duma about the poor widow and her three sons - lirnyk Laryvon # The song about Morozenko - kobzar T. Parkhomenko # The duma about the escape of the three brothers from Azov - kobzar M. Kravchenko # The duma about Khmelnytsky and Barabash - kobzar Ivan Kucherenko # The duma about the storm on the Black sea - bandurist Hnat Khotkevych # The duma about Stepan - bandurist M. Sadovsky # The song about the destruction of the Sich - M. Sadovsky's troupe. When the first half of the concert ended, as Khotkevych wrote - \\"you could not recognize the hall. You could not recognize the people who had filled the hall. All of them had delighted faces, all of them crowded around the blindmen, they shook their hands, noted down their addresses and invited then to visit as guests. The blind men themselves were excited no less: the powerful feeling of winning over the audience overfilled their hearts. For a moment they forgot that they were blind, they were filled with life. And it was pleasing to look at their re-animated joyous faces. These moments were truly unforgettable. \\" The second half consisted of four subsections: The first subsection was made up of religious and moralistic songs. # \\"The Skovorodinian psalm\\" - duet by kobzar I. Netesa and lirnyk S. Veselyj # Psalm: \\"The angels awaken the soul\\" - trio by M. Kravchenko, T. Parkhomenko, P. Drevchenko. # \\"About truth\\" - kobzar choir: I. Kucherenko, P. Hashchenko, P. Drevchenko, lirnyk Ivan Zozulia, and the singer Pavlo. Photo: A kobzar trio - M. Kravchenko, T. Parkhomenko and P. Drevchenko' The second subsection consisted of ritual and traditional folk songs. # Chumak song - M. Sadovsky # Oh beyond the hills are columns of smoke - M. Sadowky's troupe # Near the forest is a pathway - M. Sadowsky's troupe # Wedding motives - the troyista ensemble # It rain, it pours -All the bandurists and lirnyks # Beyond the meadow - All the bandurists and lirnyks The third subsection was the collection of various instruments into a musical ensemble, despite the unclear sound of the liras and the somewhat unblended voices. This produced such a round of open applause rarely is awarded even to the performance of the best symphonic orchestras. Section three consisted of humorous and satirical songs: # About the priest's wife - P. Hashchenko # Kyselyk - I. Netesa # The city woman -lirnyk Ivan Zozulia # Chechitka - P. Drevchenko # The white snows - Sadowsky's choir # Kynu kuzhil' - Sadowsky's choir And the final section was made up of instrumental works: # Dudochka - bandura ensemble # Horlytsia - bandura ensemble with liras # Hrechanyky - bandurists, lirnyks, and the troyista. The concert ended but the audience did not leave the hall. It is difficult to describe the euphoria - impossible.  Aftermath  A review of the concert appeared in the magazine \\"Etnograficheskoye obozreniye\\". \\"The Great Hall of the Kharkiv Public Library, where the meeting took place, was full, despite the fact that entrance to the hall was extremely restricted. The kobzars and the lirnyks, these carriers of south-Russian songs, were met by loud applause of those in the hall. Their artistic renditions of folk songs, about which the participants had only heard about, left such a huge impression, that the choir of the Society of Russian-Ukrainian artists directed by M. Sadowsky seemed to be quite poor in comparison to the original performance of the blind kobzars and lirnyks. The non-synthetic folk poesy, the singing of the bandurists and the soft, full of rich and textured harmony of the sounds of the bandura surpassed the performance by the professional artists and created a spark of love to folk poetry and to its carriers and people.\\" The expectations set by Khotkevych in the organization of this event were met. The performance demonstrated the high value of kobzar art, and in the preceding speech had shown that for the performance of such songs and creations, the blind kobzars were being harassed by the police officials. This created an unusual paradox. As a result, the conference put forward a proposition to lobby the Imperial Ministry of Internal Affairs to give the kobzars and lirnyks protection, to give these last survivors of the carriers of these ancient songs the right to sing their songs without repercussions and harassment. This petition was forwarded by the Moscow chapter of the archeological society to the then minister of Internal Affairs - V. Pleve. Because of the authority of the Archeological Conference the persecution of the kobzars ceased for a short period of time. The community began to be more interested in the kobzars and began to invite them to various conferences, exhibitions and private performances. As Khotkevych wrote - \\"the preservation of kobzardom became a cause; it became clear to all, that the bandura would not die. This was accomplished by the XII Archeological Conference in Kharkiv \\". A second important side of the work done by Khotkevych as a result of the conference lay in the professional preparation of performances by the various kobzars, and the organization of these performers into a kobzar ensemble. This demonstration showed that the bandura was an instrument with huge technical potential. The Bandura could be used not only as an instrument for the individual accompaniment of the voice, but also in an ensemble and orchestral setting. This meant that the bandura could now move from being played in the market places and the village and city streets and began its migration to the stage. Professional musical instrument makers began to gradually make improvements, and in its new incarnations was able to win over new audiences and fans, gradually moving towards an instrument that waIvan Kuchuhura Kucherenkos capable of general acclaim. All this came about because of the XII Archeological Conference, although it may be fairer to say that all this is due to Hnat Khotkevych realized through the XII Archeological Conference. Hnat Khotkevych had the desire to repeat the concert performances in a large concert tour of Ukraine. Unfortunately this was not possible, because his appeals to get permission from each of the governors of all the provinces in Ukraine resulted in blatant refusals. Even in Kharkiv he was unable to get permission to repeat the concert for the general public. This first kobzar concert was a nationally arousing experience and was not in the interests of the Imperial Tsarist administration. This became very evident in the governor's letter where he wrote: \\"If it were to take place in Tambov (in the ethnographic centre of European Russia), I would allow the concert to take place, but here - no.\\" References Category:Kobzarstvo ","title":"12th Archeological Congress"},{"id":"13663921","text":"Etibank A.≈û is a defunct Turkish bank.

Established in 1880 (making it the oldest in South America), the organization is managed by the \\"Artistic Union\\" (Uni√≥n Art√≠stica). The current building, the \\"Palace of the Fine Arts\\" (el Palacio de Bellas Artes), dates to 1910 and commemorates the first centennial of the Independence of Chile. It was designed by the Chilean architect Emile J√©quier in a full-blown Beaux-arts style and is situated in the Parque Forestal of Santiago. Behind it is located the Museum of Contemporary Art (Museo de Arte Contempor√°neo) of the University of Chile, in which is also located the old School of Fine Arts (Escuela de Bellas Artes). History Foundational Plate of the National Museum of Fine Arts The museum was officially founded on September 18, 1880, and originally named Museo National de Pinturas (National Painting Museum). The president of Chile, Don An√≠bal Pinto, the minister Don Manuel Garc√≠a de la Huerta, Marcos Segundo Maturana and the sculptor Jos√© Miguel Blanco together managed the creation of the museum, whose first director was the painter Juan Mochi. Exterior of the museum after the alt=In 1887 the government acquired a building known as \\"the Parthenon\\", which had been constructed by the Artistic Union for the purpose of hosting annual art expositions. The museum moved there and changed its name to Museum of Fine Art. In 1901 the government decided to create an original building for the Museum and School of Fine Arts, and Emilio J√©quier was selected. The building was built in the Parque Forestal, a landscaping work by Jorge Enrique Dubois, who had been trained in the gardening school of Versailles in France. Upon the completion of the building, it was officially inaugurated on September 21, 1910, as part of an International Exposition which formed part of the celebrations for the centennial of independence. The Museum has remained in the \\"Palace\\" ever since. The building was damaged during the 1960 Chilean Earthquake, after which it was seismically upgraded, such that damage during the 2010 Chile earthquake was confined to fallen elements of the exterior. Architecture The Palacio de Bellas Artes, the current home of the Museum, is in the Neoclassical Second Empire style and the Baroque Revival style, strongly reinforced with Art Nouveau details and touches of metallic structural architecture. The central entrance is through a gigantically enlarged version of Borromini's false-perspective window reveals from Palazzo Barberini, which encloses a pedimented doorway entirely surrounded by glass, a Beaux-Arts touch. Through a broken pediment the squared cupola rises to the top. The internal layout and the facade are both modelled after the Petit Palais of Paris. The glass cupola that crowns the central hall was designed and manufactured in Belgium and brought to Chile in 1907. The approximate weight of the armour of the museum is 115,000 kg, of the glass of the cupola, 2,400 kg. Architectonically, the floorplan of the museum is one of a central axis marked by the entrance and a grand hall with a staircase to the second floor. In the grand hall, above a balcony from the second floor, there is a carving in high relief which depicts two angels supporting a shield. They are located in the semivault above the heads of two Caryatids that arise from the balcony, carved by Antonio Coll y Pi.

Anson was the son of William Anson (1656‚Äì1720) and Isabella Carrier, sister-in-law to Thomas Parker, 1st Earl of Macclesfield. The family estate was Shugborough Hall in Staffordshire. Admiral George Anson, 1st Baron Anson was his younger brother and along with their cousin, George Parker, 2nd Earl of Macclesfield, they were taught mathematics and navigation by Isaac Newton's friend, the mathematician William Jones, who was later to propose Anson's membership for the Royal Society in 1730. Anson went up to St John's College, Oxford, and later studied law at the Inner Temple. Upon his father's death, Anson abandoned law and began the first of many travels to the continent, as was then the fashion for young men of fortune and taste. In 1732 Anson and his friend the Earl of Sandwich formed a riotous dining-club called the Society of the Dilettanti, which also had the more serious purpose of encouraging study of Greek architecture. In 1740 Thomas briefly joined his brother George on The Centurion, as he and his crew began their circumnavigation of the globe. Anson left them in order to travel to Egypt. This qualified him for the Egyptian Society and the Divan Society, the latter being a wild drinking-club of which Lord Dashwood and Lady Mary Wortley Montagu were avid members. He was elected to the House of Commons for Lichfield in 1747, a seat he held until 1770. In 1748 Anson was sent to Versailles by Lord Sandwich with secret correspondence for the Duc de Choiseul and Madame de Pompadour. In Paris he bought crayons for his friend the Duchess of Bedford, and his sister-in-law, Lady Anson, sent him a long list of presents she desired. Shugborough Hall In 1762 he succeeded to the vast fortune of Spanish treasure amassed by his admiral brother. This enabled him to further indulge his passion for architecture at Shugborough. Anson and another member of the Society of the Diletantti rebuilt the house in the Greek revival style that the pair were championing in England. Anson filled Shugborough with paintings, books and objets d'art, and had Vasalli paint allegories upon the ceilings. The park was strewn with temples and follies, including the mysterious Shepherd's Monument, the Pagoda, Pigeon House and the Tower of the Winds. The park has been described by some as a metaphor for Lord Anson's circumnavigation of the globe. Others contend that it engages aspects of many cultures, both as a tribute to Admiral Anson's voyage, and as a representation of Thomas Anson's interest in syncretic philosophies. Anson died unmarried in March 1773. The Anson estates were passed on to his nephew, George Adams, who assumed the surname of Anson and was ancestor of the Earls of Lichfield.

It is located in the town of Tinos on the island of Tinos. The complex is built around a miraculous icon which according to tradition was found after the Virgin appeared to the nun Pelagia and revealed to her the place where the icon was buried. The icon is widely believed to be the source of numerous miracles. It is by now almost completely encased in silver, gold, and jewels, and is commonly referred to as the \\"Megal√≥charƒì\\" (\\"[She of] Great Grace\\") or simply the \\"Ch√°rƒì Tƒìs\\" (\\"Her Grace\\"). By extension the church is often called the same, and is considered a protectress of seafarers and healer of the infirm. The icon was found on the very first days after the creation of the modern Greek State, henceforth Our Lady of Tinos was declared the patron saint of the Greek nation. The icon was at the time thought to be the handwork of St. Luke the Evangelist, a possibility that can neither be confirmed nor ruled out, and a nationwide fund collection was carried out for the building of a church to house it. The church was designed by the architect from Tinos, Efstratios Emmanuel Kalonaris in the Renaissance style and was inaugurated in 1830. Since then it constitutes the major Christian pilgrimage in Greece, equal to what is Lourdes in France or Fatima in Portugal. The church receives a vast number of donations in silver and gold votives each year; these are auctioned and used for charities. The church is officially dedicated to the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary. The major feast of the church, however, is on 15 August when the Dormition of the Virgin Mary (Theotokos) is commemorated by the Greek Orthodox Church, following the strong tradition of the Aegean Islands where the Dormition is grandly celebrated in mid-August as the principal summer feast.

Biography A native of Aizu, Yamamoto claimed descent from the famed military strategist Yamamoto Kansuke. A child prodigy, he could read at age four, and recite Chinese Jueju poetry at age five. He was sent to Edo at age 22, to study with Katsu Kaish≈´, under the direction of Sakuma Sh≈çzan, rangaku and modern military science. He returned to Aizu at age 28, and became an instructor of h≈çjutsu at the Nisshinkan, the Aizu domain's academy. In 1862, he was assigned to assist the Aizu Domain daimy≈ç Matsudaira Katamori during the latter's tenure in Kyoto as Kyoto Shugoshoku. The situation in Kyoto was very unsettled, and Yamamoto fought against Ch≈çsh≈´ Domain samurai during the Kinmon Incident on August 20, 1864. After the start of the Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration, he did not participate in the nearby Battle of Toba‚ÄìFushimi, but remained behind with his forces in Kyoto itself to attack the fortified residence of the Satsuma Domain. During the attack, he suffered a concussion and subsequently lost his eyesight. He was taken into custody by Satsuma forces soon afterwards. After the end of the war, he was pardoned through the intercession of Iwakura Tomomi. Subsequently, he was served as a member of the prefectural assembly of Kyoto. After becoming a Christian, Yamamoto worked with Joseph Hardy Neesima to found Doshisha University in Kyoto. Kakuma himself served as the university's second president. Yamamoto's sister was Neesima Yae, who also fought in the Boshin War. Apart from his work in education, Yamamoto was also an author. One of his best-known works was a lengthy work on national reform, penned during his captivity in 1868. Yamamoto was portrayed by actor Ry≈´ Raita in the 1987 miniseries Byakkotai, and by the actor Hidetoshi Nishijima in the 2013 NHK taiga drama Yae no Sakura.

Background  Despite Wang's high status, little is firmly established about his background or career except for the years that he served as chancellor -- as, unusual for a chancellor, he did not have a biography in either the Old Book of Tang or the New Book of Tang.See the Table of Contents for the Old Book of Tang and the Table of Contents for the New Book of Tang. According to the table of chancellors in the New Book of Tang, his father was Wang Wuxuan (ÁéãÊ≠¶ÂÆ£), who at one point served as the prefect of Yue Prefecture (Â≤≥Â∑û, roughly modern Yueyang, Hunan).New Book of Tang, vol. 72.2.  During Emperor Gaozong's reign  As of summer 680, during Emperor Gaozong's reign, Wang Dezhen was serving as Zhongshu Shilang (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰æçÈÉé), the deputy head of the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng), when he was given the designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Sanpin (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ã‰∏âÂìÅ), making him a chancellor de facto. Five months later, however, without any reason given in the currently extant historical records, he was made the secretary general for Emperor Gaozong's son Li Dan (the later Emperor Ruizong) the Prince of Yu, and was no longer chancellor.  During Empress Dowager Wu's regency  As of 684, Wang was still serving as the secretary general for Li Dan, as well as the minister of rites, when Li Dan's older brother Li Zhe, who had succeeded Emperor Gaozong after Emperor Gaozong's death in late 83 (as Emperor Zhongzong), was deposed by Empress Dowager Wu. She made Li Dan the new emperor (as Emperor Ruizong), and subsequently made Wang Shizhong (‰æç‰∏≠) ‚Äî the head of the examination bureau of government (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng) and a post considered one for a chancellor. In 685, however, for reasons lost to history, Wang was demoted to the post of prefect of Tong Prefecture (ÂêåÂ∑û, roughly modern Weinan, Shaanxi) ‚Äî but on the same day, was then further exiled to Xiang Prefecture (Ë±°Â∑û, roughly modern Laibin, Guangxi). Nothing further was recorded about him, although the table of chancellors in the New Book of Tang indicated that his son Wang Jiusi (Áéã‰πùÊÄù) later served as a county magistrate, as did his grandson Wang Qian (ÁéãÊø≥).

He was one of the first six British prisoners of war to arrive at Oflag IV-C, Colditz, in 1940. He made and assisted in numerous escape attempts, working with the chairman of the escape committee, Pat Reid, and was still at the castle when it was liberated by the US Army in April 1945. He was the honorary secretary of the Colditz Association for 50 years. Lockwood was born in London, the son of a jobber at the London Stock Exchange. He was educated at Whitgift School in Croydon, and then worked for his father's firm in the City of London. He joined the Territorial Army's 22nd (County of London) Battalion of the London Regiment (The Queen's Royal West Surreys) in 1933. He was mobilized in August 1939 and trained at Yeovil before being posted to Le Mans, commanding a company of the 1st/6th Battalion of the Queen's Royal Regiment. After marching with his unit to Belgium, he was captured in the retreat to Dunkirk in May 1940. He was sent to Oflag VII-C, at Laufen Castle. With six other prisoners, including Pat Reid, he dug a tunnel to escape, thought to be the first escape from a German prisoner of war camp in the Second World War. They escaped in two groups of three, with Reid leading the first group and Lockwood in the second group with Captain Harry Elliott of the Irish Guards and Captain Dick Howe of the Royal Tank Regiment. All six were recaptured and sent to Colditz Castle, where they became the first British prisoners to join three Canadians, who had arrived the previous day, and over 100 Poles, who had been there since September 1939. Lockwood made and assisted in numerous escape attempts, working with the chairman of the escape committee, Pat Reid. Reid was later replaced as escape officer by Dick Howe, and escaped; Lockwood was still at the castle when it was liberated by the US Army in April 1945. After the war, Lockwood returned to work in the City of London, then moved to work in a Jersey branch office for 10 years. He became the secretary of the Colditz Association, organising regular reunions until the association was wound up in 2006. In the 1955 film, The Colditz Story, based on Reid's book of the same name, Lockwood was played by Richard Wattis. He received an MBE in 1990. He never married.

Definition in a special case  Let X be a metric space, equipped with the metric \\\\mathrm{d}_X, and let x \\\\in X be a point.

Examples  For example, let S be the boundary of a simple polygon, and X the interior of the polygon. Then the cut locus is the medial axis of the polygon.

As a second example, let S be a point x on the surface of a convex polyhedron P, and X the surface itself. Then the cut locus of x is what is known as the ridge tree of P with respect to x. This ridge tree has the property that cutting the surface along its edges unfolds P to a simple planar polygon. This polygon can be viewed as a net for the polyhedron. = Example for the special case = Let X = S^2, that is the regular 2-sphere. Then the cut locus of every point on the sphere consists of exactly one point, namely the antipodal one.

Founded in 1976, Le Travel Store claims to be the first business to call itself a \\"travel store,\\" and, the first retail store to cater to backpackers and other independent travelers, selling luggage, travel accessories, guidebooks, maps, and backpacks in a single retail location. History Joan and Bill Keller opened the first Le Travel Store in Pacific Beach in November 1976 after noticing that independent travelers going to Europe, Asia, and Latin America were often using outdoor gear such as backpacks rather than more traditional luggage, but that no retail businesses were specifically geared towards these independent backpackers. The founding of Le Travel Store coincided with an increase in the popularity and feasibility of independent travel, which was also gave rise to numerous other companies, such as Lonely Planet, Eagle Creek, and STA Travel, that sought to cater to these travelers. Le Travel Store was one of the original tenants when Horton Plaza opened in 1985, and then in 1994, it was one of the first retail businesses to move into San Diego's Gaslamp Quarter during that neighborhood's urban renewal. Since its early days, Le Travel Store has done mail order business, at first with a print catalog, and then, from 1996 on, at its ecommerce website.

Leyman, A practical hero, Mechanical Engineering, Magazine Online It uses the same principle as Hero's aeolipile. The device is placed in a suitable hole in the ground (or at the slope of a hill). The water is delivered to the top of a vertical cylinder, at the bottom of which is a rotor with specially bent pipes with nozzles (see image). Due to the hydrostatic pressure, the water is ejected from the nozzles, causing the rotor to rotate. The useful torque is transferred to a powered device through a belt and pulley system. Segner turbines, also called reaction or Scotch turbines, were built in the mid-1850s to power the inclined plane lifts along the Morris Canal in New Jersey. Today, the Segner wheel principle is used in irrigation sprinklers. Alexander Bogdanov cited this an example of an important innovation which paved the way for the development of steam engines.

Skilled in gunnery, she helped defend Aizu during the Boshin War, earning her the nickname of the ‚ÄúBakumatsu Joan of Arc‚Äù. Yaeko served as a nurse during the Russo-Japanese War and Sino-Japanese War, and became the first woman outside of Imperial House of Japan after the Meiji Restoration (originated in 1870s) to be decorated for her service to the country. She was famously known as the wife of Joseph Hardy Neesima, the founder of Doshisha English School in 1875, and with a help of American missionary Alice J. Starkweather, they co-founded the Doshisha Girls‚Äô School a year later. Early life Yamamoto Yae was born the daughter of Yamamoto Gonpachi, a samurai and one of the official gunnery instructors in Aizu Domain, and his wife Saku. Her family claimed descent from the Takeda clan's retainer Yamamoto Kansuke. In 1865, she was married to Shonosuke Kawasaki, a Rangaku scholar from Izushi Domain. =Boshin War= Yae was skilled in gunnery, which was highly unusual for a woman of the Bakumatsu period. She took part in the defense of Aizu when the Boshin War broke out in 1868. During the Battle of Aizu, she fought against the Meiji government and its coalition forces, defending Aizuwakamatsu Castle with her Spencer carbine along with Aizu warriors. After the surrender of Aizu Domain, Yaeko took shelter in nearby Yonezawa Domain in Yonezawa, Yamagata and stayed there for one year. Yae and her husband had separated after the defeat of Aizu, as Shonosuke became a prisoner of war. Their divorce was finalised in 1871. In Kyoto Yae's Statue. In 1871, she traveled to Kyoto to look for her brother Yamamoto Kakuma, who had spent years as a prisoner of war in Satsuma custody. Upon her arrival in Kyoto, Yaeko was hired as a substitute instructor at Kyoto Women's School (ja) on the recommendation of her brother Kakuma, who was working as an advisor for the Kyoto prefectural government at that time. While Yaeko was working at the women's school, she was acquainted with a sad≈ç instructor from the house of Urasenke. Through their interaction, Yaeko was able to familiarise herself with the art of Japanese tea ceremony. She obtained the tea-master qualification in 1894 and became a tea master of the Urasenke tradition, with the art-name of . During her tenure at the school, she was also acquainted with a kad≈ç instructor from the house of Ikenob≈ç. She was granted the certificate to practice flower arrangement from Ikenob≈ç in 1896. Throughout the early 1870s, Yaeko remained in Kyoto, and became a Christian after she met Rev. Joseph Hardy Neesima, who used to visit her brother Kakuma back when they were in Aizu. Neesima was a former samurai who spent 10 years in the United States from 1864‚Äì74 to pursue higher education. He returned to Japan in 1874, and was in the process of building a Western school that promoted Christianity. However, the concept was vehemently opposed by Buddhists and Shintoists in Kyoto, who submitted several complaints to the prefectural government. Yaeko and Neesima were engaged not long after he returned to Japan, in October 1875. Shortly afterward, Yaeko was dismissed from her position in the women's school following pressure from the government. Together with Neesima and Kakuma, Yaeko volunteered to assist in running the new school Neesima founded. She played an integral role in the founding of this Doshisha English School and its subsequent development. Yamamoto Yaeko and Joseph Hardy Neesima Yaeko and Neesima were married on 3 January 1876. As Neesima was educated in the United States, he was also a believer in women's rights. Yaeko, with the help of the American missionary Alice J. Starkweather, opened a Joshijuku (small girls‚Äô school) at the former residence of the Yanagihara family. The girl's school was subsequently renamed to Doshisha Branch School for Girls and then to Doshisha Girls‚Äô School in 1877. While it contradicted social norms of Edo period Japan, it happened to be balancing for a spirited woman like Yaeko. The courtesy given by Neesima toward Yaeko was viewed as a sign of shrewishness on the part of Yaeko, and she was consequently criticised as a \\"bad wife\\" by Japanese society throughout their marriage. Contrary to traditional Japanese couples, Neesima and Yaeko were friendly to each other. He praised her lifestyle as \\"handsome\\" in his letter to friends in United States. Later career 176x176px Following the sudden death of Neesima on 23 January 1890, Yaeko and her colleagues at Doshisha School gradually began to drift apart. Doshisha students from Satsuma and Ch≈çsh≈´ Domain were not warmly received by her, since they attacked Aizu during the Boshin War. In her later career, Yaeko turned her focus to nursing and became a member of Japanese Red Cross on 26 April 1890. During the First Sino-Japanese War, she joined the army and spent four months as a nurse stationed in Hiroshima. Yaeko led a team of 40 nurses to care for the wounded soldiers while working to improve the social status of trained nurses. Her efforts were recognised by the Japanese government, and she was awarded her first Order of the Precious Crown in 1896. Niijima Yae (right) in her later years with Evangeline Booth, General of the Salvation Army (left), circa November 1929 After the First Sino-Japanese War, Yaeko worked as an instructor in nursing schools. When the Russo-Japanese War broke out in 1904, she joined the army again and served as a volunteer nurse at Imperial Japanese Army hospital in Osaka for two months. For this service she received her second Order of the Precious Crown. She was further awarded a silver cup at the inauguration of the Sh≈çwa Emperor in 1928 for her overall commitment to the country. Death Niijima Yae on March 3, 1932, 3 months before her death Niijima Yae's tomb stone at Doshisha Cemetery While Yaeko did not bear any children from her two marriages, she did adopt three children from Yonezawa Domain throughout her life. However, they were not closely connected. In her final years, she maintained her residence on Teramachi Street in Kyoto until she died on 14 June 1932 at the age of 86. She was given a funeral sponsored by Doshisha University. Her burial site is located at Doshisha Cemetery in Saky≈ç-ku, Kyoto.

His father was Arwo Mikkonen, guitarist of the Finnish rock band Popeda. His father died in 1986, leaving eight-year-old Christus and his four-year-old brother Matthau, without a father figure in their life. On Negative's single \\"Fading Yourself\\" (March 14, 2007), Sir Christus did vocals for a bonus track: \\"Lost in America\\" (originally by Alice Cooper). Negative has never performed this song live. Christus performed this song live, with the band Private Line, on November 28, 2007. Previous projects =SnoWhite= SnoWhite, formerly known as Blaquarium, was founded in winter 2007 by Dino, Purtsi, Julius and Vode. In June 2008 Rafaello joined the band, and their first gig was in Amadeus during Tammerfest, supporting another band. After that Vode decided to leave. Dino, Purtsi and Julius gave free hand to Rafaello to choose a new guitarist. He decided that Christus would be the best choice. First gig as SnoWhite and not Blaquarium was in Vastavirta Klubi, Tampere supporting The Bitterlicks and The VooDoo Nights. \\"Is it my body\\" and \\"Number of the beast\\" are the only two cover-songs they are playing. SnoWhite's second gig, taking place in Vastavirtaklubi in Tampere September 13, 2008, has got positive reviews by Aamulehti. Sir Christus left SnoWhite on 3 January 2010. Line up: *Julius - vocals *Dino - drums *Purtsi - bass *Rafaello - guitar *Sir General Christus - guitar =Black Jesus= Christus has had a side project since fall 2007 that is called Black Jesus - the name was later changed to Black Jezus and then changed back to Black Jesus. When he left Negative, at first people thought Christus had disappeared but then there were dates announced in February. There were speculations about Christus and his position in this band, and the band was thought to be what it was to begin with: a side project, a mere base for playing some shows and cover songs and have some fun. The band split in late 2008 and played their last gig in Somero in November 2008. Line up: *Madbone Macceus - vocals *Sir General Christus - guitar and backing vocals *El Rafaello - guitar *Jimmie Sweat - bass *E.√Ödolf Maniac II - drums =Matthau Mikojan= Shortly after Christus' leaving Negative, there were rumours that he would join his brother's solo-project on bass. It was not until late that Matthau himself announced his line up that the rumours were confirmed. Christus played the guitar still, and not the bass. He was thought to be only a part of the live shows, like the rest of the line up. Matthau announced on his website after the German Tour (Schraubelocker Tour 2008) that the three-piece band is now a band and not a solo-project with a live band. In March/early April there were shootings of a music video for the song \\"Too Fortunate to Cry\\", in which Matthau and Christus appear. Line up: *Matthau Mikojan - vocals and second guitar *Sir Christus - guitar and backing vocals *Teemu Broman - bass *Simo Stenmann - drums Christus left this project after three months and the band will not replace him. =Negative= Negative is a Finnish glam rock band located in Tampere. They released their first album, War of Love in 2003. War of Love has sold gold in Finland and is now close to platinum. In 2004 they came with their second album, Sweet & Deceitful that has also sold gold. Late 2006 Anorectic made its appearance. Christus joined the band in 2002.

This comes of the way it bristles, so that it reminds of a Yucca palm. Due to Christus' first name being Jukka and the phonetic likeness to Yucca, his hairstyle therefore got this name. The Pink Lady Sir Christus is best known together with his pink guitar, the Pink Lady. This guitar, a Flying Finn, had 'Sir Christus' written on her neck. During a Negative show in China, October 1, 2007, Sir Christus broke a guitar on stage. Fans all over the world were shocked, cause it seemed that he had murdered the Lady. The news came that it was just a cheap, pink guitar which Negative's manager Tommi Liimatainen had bought in Beijing for the occasion. September 11, 2005 during a concert in Bochum, Germany, Christus accidentally damaged The Pink Lady. Near the end of the show, he was rolling over the floor and that was when the accident happened. The day after in Cologne, The Pink Lady reappeared on stage held together with duct-tape.  Death  He died December 7, 2017.

Procedure The surgical procedure involves closure of the nasal cavity affected with atrophic rhinitis by creating mucocutaneous flaps. These flaps are sutured together in two layers: first the mucosal layer, then the skin layer. The nasal cavity is kept closed for a period of 6 months/each; then an examination is done - if the crusts have disappeared, a revision surgery is performed and the nasal cavity is reopened. The theory behind this procedure is that the closed nasal cavity has time to heal. =Outcome= The first patient to undergo Young's operation specifically to treat Atrophic Rhinitis was in Sheffield in 1963, by Austen Young, when both nostrils were closed. The patient had a chronic condition causing social ostracism due to the strong odour. Both nostrils were re-opened in 1965 and the patient has had no problem since then (current as at October 2020). However, the patient has no sense of smell and inhibited taste (i.e. cannot taste spices/herbs).

Social policy =Education= In July 2007, Roxas filed several bills in his first through the creation of a ‚Äúpeople‚Äôs fund‚Äù for education that will help close the resource gaps in teachers‚Äô training and salaries, infrastructure needs like classrooms and school buildings, among others. He also sought to increase the measly salaries of public school teachers, he filed a bill to mandate the upgrade of the government salary schedule under the Salary Standardization law every four years, or whenever necessary, to the prevailing cost of living index. For the benefit of students in private schools, he filed a proposed Pre-Need Code, which seeks to tighten-up the regulation of pre-need companies. He has also consistently pushed for increases in the budget of the Department of Education. =Energy policy= Senator Mar Roxas, then chairman of the committee on economic affairs, trade and commerce, sought amendments to the power industry reform law to allow large electricity consumers to directly connect with state-owned National Power Corporation or any independent power producers to supply their power requirements. He also supports the use of biofuels. He believes that it will definitely reduce the country's dependence on imported oil once biofuels manufacturers begin operations in the country. Recently, he urged the trade, energy and finance departments to help ease the impact of rising petroleum prices on consumers. ‚ÄúI urge the three departments to plan and calibrate our responses [to rising oil prices] so as not to undermine [the] gains in the economy and financial markets,‚Äù said Roxas, chairman of the committee on trade and commerce. He said wage earners had to tighten their belts some more each time petroleum prices rose, and in particular the prices of cooking gas. ‚ÄúAny increase in the prices of liquefied petroleum gas and kerosene upsets the household budget for food and other essential needs,‚Äù he said. =Health care= Roxas' position on health care has been highlighted with his cheaper medicines bill that would reduce the prices of medicine by allowing local pharmaceutical companies to manufacture drugs whose patents had already expired, by expanding the parallel imports of commonly used drugs, and by aggressively promoting the production and consumption of generic drugs. Under the bill, the President is empowered to impose price ceilings on medicines on the recommendation of the secretaries of health and of trade and industry in times of calamity, and if there is widespread price manipulation of any drugs. His bill also calls for the creation of a Drug Prices Regulation Board and the strengthening of the Bureau of Food and Drugs (BFAD). Although there has been controversy regarding his authorship of the law and his actual positions. He has also been accused of watering down the cheaper medicines act, and is actually in support of mulch- nationals. But on October 9, 2007, he dropped his objection to the version of the House of Representatives which proposes setting up of market controls and conceded that the sponsors of a similar bill in the House correctly anticipated that big drug companies could manipulate and prevent drugstores from selling imported cheaper medicines. He said the use of price controls could come in if market competition from cheaper medicines from abroad and generic drugs do not work and make medicines affordable to the public. =Human rights= He expressed his deep concern over what he termed as ‚Äúthe rising tide of human-rights abuses‚Äù in the Philippines as exemplified by the abduction of five ordinary citizens belonging to the Union of the Masses for Democracy and Justice (UMDJ). Roxas said that because of these incidents, well-established international organizations and institutions such as the London-based Amnesty International, Paris-based Reporters Sans Frontieres (Reporters Without Borders) and officials of the US government now hold the Philippines accountable for these apparent failures of governance. He also expressed his concern over the possibility that there is a ‚Äúshadow government operating in the deep background without the knowledge of Palace officials.‚Äù According to Roxas, the Filipino people are entitled to forthright answers on how the abduction came about and who are the people behind it. He also filed Senate Bill No. 110 which would decriminalize libel in the Philippines and limit the venue of filing libel suits. He believes in the right of individuals to be protected from unethical and irresponsible journalism, but for him, imprisonment is not a just penalty for such. He stresses that, civil damages are enough penalty and deterrence, considering the present economic situation of journalists. =Terrorism= He voted against the Human Security Act of 2007‚Äôs passage in the Senate because he believed that the fight against terror requires urgent operational reforms over measures that could impair civil liberties. =Death penalty= He opposed the revival of death penalty in the Philippines through execution. He said that the revival is not a permanent solution for a successful campaign against crimes. =Divorce= In an interview by Mel Tiangco on the GMA program Wanted: President on January 31, 2016, Roxas said that he is among the 40% of Filipinos who does not favor divorce during a Social Weather Stations poll in 2015, saying: \\"For me, the family is the center of each person's life, so we should do everything to ensure that the family remains intact and I think that's our country's foundation.\\" =LGBT rights and same-sex marriage= While being interviewed on the GMA program Wanted: President, Roxas said that he is not in favor on the legalization of same-sex marriage as a public policy, saying: \\"As a public policy, I‚Äôm not in favor [of same sex-marriage]. Although I have relatives who I'm close to and have partners and I respect them, I love them, I accept them wholeheartedly.\\" However, according to his wife Korina Sanchez, Roxas is supportive of LGBT rights and is in favor of a bill against gender and sexual orientation discrimination. Economic policy =Philippine entry into the Trans-Pacific Partnership= Roxas disagrees with the Aquino administration's moves to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement. Rather than entering a bad deal, not joining the partnership would be better than experiencing the adverse effects of the entry of cheap agricultural products on Philippine farmers. More developed countries in the TPP enjoy comparative advantages in terms of agricultural technology and state subsidies with which the agricultural industry of the Philippines is at a disadvantage.http://opinion.inquirer.net/91258/roxas-breaks-away-from- aquino#ixzz3ueYywN9P =Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program= In 1988, Republic Act No. 6657, otherwise known as the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARL) was signed into law and became the legal basis for the implementation of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP). It is an act instituting a CARP with the aim of promoting social justice and industrialization. RA 6657 also provided the mechanism for its implementation. It was signed by President Corazon C. Aquino on June 10. Roxas stressed the need to improve on the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program, saying it has not been as successful as it was hoped to be since it has not alleviated poverty. He said that the CARP expires by 2008 and by law there is a need to review it, and, \\"as in life, what may have been appropriate 20 years ago may not be appropriate anymore today.\\" \\"So, if CARP is to be continued, it must be in a different form with more resources. If it is not continued then we must put a different tool in place to alleviate poverty in the countryside,\\" Roxas said. For Roxas, the CARP, as it has been implemented so far, clearly has not led to greater income and opportunities for those who are supposed to have been its beneficiaries. CARP was designed as a wealth redistributive program, and land was the focus because it was thought at the time that wealth came from land, he said. But land in and of itself does not produce wealth, it requires inputs, support, farm to market roads, fair trading, he also said. =Pre-need industry= Roxas filed Senate Bill No. 105 which seeks to address the absence of a statute that regulates the pre-need industry by establishing the Pre-Need Industry Act of 2007 to govern the operations of firms which issue or sell pre-need plans or similar contracts and investments. =SMEs= Roxas filed a bill that provides a package of liberal incentives to micro, small and medium enterprises through amendments to the Magna Carta for Small Enterprises (Republic Act 6977) He said that the micro, small and medium enterprises comprise 99.6 percent of local businesses and employ 70 percent of the Philippines' total work force. But he noted that their full potential has yet to be achieved, as they currently contribute only about 30 percent to the national economy. ‚ÄúWe want to reward our small enterprises for their contributions to the economy by ensuring their access to credit and support services. This is about giving our Filipino companies the chance to realize their potential,‚Äù Roxas said. The salient provisions of the bill he filed include: *Modifying the classifications of enterprises in terms of size of assets: micro‚Äîbelow P3 million; small‚ÄîP3 million to P15 million; and medium‚Äîabove P15 million. *Mandating the creation of a six-year MSME Development Plan. *Adjusting the structure and functions of the MSME Development Council to better respond to the needs of the industries. *Increasing the authorized capital stock of Small Business Corp. from P5 billion to P10 billion, and putting it under the regulation of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. *Increasing the mandatory credit allocation of banks to MSMEs from a total of 8 percent to 10 percent of loanable funds. Roxas, as Senate Committee on Trade and Commerce chair and primary author of R. A. 9501, welcomed on May 22, 2008, the early and historical signing of the law by Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo: ‚ÄúAfter this much-awaited law has taken effect, I look forward to the executive‚Äôs proper implementation of this law that would give our small entrepreneurs more tools to grow their businesses and employ more workers.‚Äù gmanews.tv, Arroyo signs MSME law; redefines micro, small tradersgmanews.tv, Arroyo signs MSME law; redefines micro, small traders =Taxation= He junked a plan of the Bureau of Internal Revenue to impose a steep hike in the common carrier‚Äôs tax on public utility vehicles in favor of a gradual increase to soften the impact on bus and jeepney operators. He said the 2,600% tax increase is too much and will likely pass on the cost to commuters. Roxas said, ‚Äúif there is a need for an increase, it should not be drastic. There is a principle that any hike in the tax should be gradual, that will enable the bus and jeepney operators to adjust to the changes.\\" He also filed Senate Bill No. 103 which would exempt minimum wage earners in the private sector and government workers in Salary Grades 1 to 3, amending certain provisions of Republic Act 8424, otherwise known as the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended. He believes that the minimum wage earners can no longer afford to be taxed and to be placed in the income tax process in the same manner as higher-earning employees. Roxas started a campaign against the value-added tax, although he voted in favor of the law when it was being deliberated in the Senate. Foreign policy =Iraq= Roxas filed a resolution last July 31, 2007 asking the Department of Foreign Affairs to look into the OFW trafficking issue. He asked the Department of Labor and Employment to investigate the recruitment of Filipino workers by such firms as First Kuwaiti International in light of findings by the Department of Foreign Affairs that the ban on entry to the war-torn country was being circumvented. \\"The continued recruitment of Filipino workers to Iraq, despite the government's deployment ban, is alarming, especially since they are being made to work long hours under extremely stressful conditions,\\" Roxas said in a statement. The request came in the wake of reports that certain firms outside the country are recruiting private security personnel for posting in Iraq. Roxas had also been given a briefing by Special Envoy Roy Cimatu on the situation of Filipinos in Iraq following a \\"fact-finding mission\\" ordered by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo last July. Based on the briefing, the number of Overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) in Iraq has declined from 7,600 in 2004 to 6,647 as of this 2007. Roxas said that the number is still considerable, given that the ban has been in place since 2004. He stressed that something had to be done to prevent Filipinos from venturing into dangerous areas and the onus fell both on the government and recruitment firms like First Kuwaiti International to take action. =Israel-Lebanon conflict= During the Israel-Hezbollah conflict last 2006, Roxas expressed sadness that statements of some Philippine diplomatic officials tended to show that the one-country team approach seemed to be ignored in dealing with the crisis. He said that the government‚Äôs contingency plan to evacuate thousands of Overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) caught in the Israeli-Hezbollah conflict in Lebanon could be implemented smoothly if Philippine officials would hew closely to the ‚Äúteam one-country approach‚Äù that is mandated by a policy under Republic Act 8042, the Migrant Workers Act of 1995. This policy means that in all diplomatic posts, the ambassador shall act as the head of the team and that all attaches from different offices and departments must follow his or her lead. He also asked about the government‚Äôs reintegration plan for returning OFWs. He noted that most workers left their savings and belongings behind and must now start from scratch in rebuilding their lives. ‚ÄúIt is the government‚Äôs role to make sure that these workers who have been driven out of work by a war not of their own making, would get the assistance and support that they deserve,‚Äù he stressed. =Nigeria= Roxas warned jobseekers against accepting job offers to Nigeria in light of a series of abductions of foreign workers by different rebel groups in the said country. He issued the warning as he welcomed the safe return of OFW Albert Bacani Sr. who arrived in Manila after being released by his Nigerian abductors. \\"I urge all jobseekers to always check with the POEA and even the DFA on whether conditions in a desired place of work overseas are safe and secure,\\" he said. Current issues =2007 Glorietta explosion= He said that the bombing can affect the advance of the Philippines' economy, but still believed the Filipino people can overcome the crisis. =Estrada conviction= In order to finally put a just closure to national divisiveness, Roxas filed Senate Resolution No. 135 calling on President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to issue a pardon to former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada (popularly known as \\"Erap\\") at the appropriate time. Roxas said, \\"Our people have been divided due to the politics of the last 20 years. But while our people are fragmented, they share one thing: they remain poor, and it is because our politics has failed to pay attention to them.\\" \\"I urge the President to initiate the difficult process of uniting our people and finally focusing on the real problems that our people experience. Pardoning Erap at the appropriate time would be a step towards unity,\\" he stressed. \\"The grant of pardon to Erap on humanitarian grounds should not in any way be construed as condoning corruption, or as diminishing the legal weight of the ruling of the Sandiganbayan, but serves solely as an embodiment of the people's will for closure on one of the most divisive chapters of our national life,\\" he added. He also let Malaca√±ang decide whether to issue a conditional or absolute pardon. An absolute pardon would erase the conviction and Estrada would no longer require him to return the money he had allegedly stolen and to surrender the properties that he had acquired from the fruits of the plunder. =Japan-Philippine Economic Partnership Agreement= \\"In trade negotiations, no deal is always better than a bad deal.\\" This is what Roxas said on JPEPA. He issued a warning after President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo pressed on the Senate to ratify the Japan- Philippine Economic Partnership Agreement (JPEPA) amid concerns aired by Tokyo for the early approval. Roxas was optimistic that the pact would be given serious consideration by the Senate if the government revised the deal to get a better trade-off. Roxas, said that a renegotiation is a possibility as he pointed out that it remains unclear what is the sum total of the benefits that the agreement will bring to the country compared to ‚Äúwhat we will give up.‚Äù =Trillanes detention= Roxas supports the calls to allow Senator Antonio Trillanes IV to attend the Senate's sessions. In his press statement, he said, \\"Our people's choice as stated clearly in the May 14 elections must prevail.\\" \\"Senator Trillanes, by virtue of his nearly 12 million votes, should be allowed to attend all Senate functions including our afternoon sessions. He must be permitted to serve the people and the AFP should help him, not hinder him, from performing his new mandate. If this means taking the trouble of escorting him every day to and from the Senate then so be it. The people have spoken and we must respect their decision,\\" he added. =ZTE broadband deal= Roxas introduced a resolution urging President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to cancel the Philippine government's National Broadband Network (NBN) project with China's Zhong Xing Telecommunications Equipment (ZTE) Corporation. Roxas said that the $329.4-million deal \\"was driven by supply and not by demand\\" and will not benefit Filipinos. The senator also said the cancellation of the deal would not affect the relationship of the Philippines with China. Later, after the President scrapped the ZTE deal, he said the government avoided further embarrassment and \\"domestic turmoil\\". This, as he noted the need to tighten the government's approval process for foreign-aided and funded projects to \\"protect the people's money\\" against similar disadvantageous deals. However, Roxas said that his committee will continue to conduct hearings on the ZTE deal, as part of efforts to improve legislation governing government projects. He debunked the government's claim that P4.7 billion in its communication expenses will be saved as a result of the $330-million contract with ZTE Corp. of China for the National Broadband Network, which seeks to connect government offices. \\"Do not say that this P4.7 billion will actually be all totally saved, because a huge portion of this is really government communicating with the citizens,\\" Roxas said. \\"You're using these numbers not to help clarify, but to further confuse,\\" Roxas was quoted in a press statement from his office.

The term may describe crepuscular animals that are significantly active during the predawn or early morning hours. During the morning twilight period and shortly thereafter, these animals partake in important tasks, such as scanning for mates, mating, and foraging. Matutinal behaviour is thought to be adaptive because there may be less competition between species, and sometimes even a higher prevalence of food during these hours. It may also serve as an anti- predator adaptation by allowing animals to sit between the brink of danger that may come with nocturnal and diurnal activity.  Etymology  The etymology of the term matutinal is the Latin word mƒÅt≈´tƒ´nus, ('of or pertaining to the morning') (from MƒÅt≈´ta, Roman goddess of the dawn + -ƒ´nus, '-ine') + -ƒÅlis, ('-al').  Adaptive Relevance  Selection pressures, such as high predatory activity or low food may require animals to change their behaviours to adapt. An animal changing the time of day at which it carries out significant tasks (e.g., mating and/or foraging) is recognized as one of these adaptive behaviours. For example, human activity, which is more predominant during daylight hours, has forced certain species (most often larger mammals) living in urban areas to shift their schedules to crepuscular ones. When observed in environments where there is little or no human activity, these same species often do not exhibit this temporal shift. It may be argued that if the goal is to avoid human activity, or any other diurnal predator's activity, a nocturnal schedule would be safer. However, many of these animals depend on sight, so a matutinal or crepuscular schedule is especially advantageous as it allows animals to both avoid predation, and have sufficient light to mate and forage. = Matutinal Mating = For certain species, commencing mating during the early morning's twilight period may be adaptive because it could reduce the risk of predation, increase the chance of finding mates, and reduce competition for mates, all of which may increase reproductive success. A praying mantis (Mantis religiosa) blending in with its environment. To mate, they must terminate this pose and take up a more vulnerable one. They only do this during matutinal hours.  Anti-Predatory Adaptation  Animals are generally more vulnerable during copulation (e.g., praying mantis), so mating during a time when there is less predatory activity may be an anti-predatory adaptation. Some species may even take up to several hours to finish mating, which increases this vulnerability. For species that copulate for longer periods, shifting their mating schedule may additionally allow enough time for the male to completely inseminate the female (i.e., it will reduce the chance of having to escape from a predator mid-copulation). One example of a matutinal mating routine is exhibited by female tropical praying mantises (Mantis religiosa). To avoid detection from predators they use different stances to blend in with their environment. They can orient themselves to look like leaves or sticks. However, when females are ready to mate they will take up a different posture where they expose pheromone- emitting glands that attract mates, and in the process must disengage from their normal camouflaging stance. Likely to compensate for this vulnerability, females will initiate this stance only at first light when diurnal predators that are visual hunters are less active (e.g., birds and insectivorous primates).  Reduced Competition  A superb fairywren (Malurus cyaneus). This bird engages in extra-pair copulations during pre-dawn and early morning hours.Some animals engage in matutinal searching flights to find mates early in the morning. It is thought that this is adaptive because it increases the chance of finding mates, and reduces competition for mates (i.e., by flying directly to a potential mate before it has a chance to find other mates). This is supported by the mating behaviour of certain socially monogamous birds. For example, female superb fairywrens (Malurus cyaneus), are a monogamous bird that perform extra-pair copulations during matutinal hours. One explanation for the prevalence of extra-pair copulation is that it enhances the gene pool of the species' offspring. This activity is most often seen matutinally because they: (1) can avoid being followed by their monogamous partner in the dimly-lit early morning, (2) males are more likely to be present in their territory during these hours, and (3) males are more likely to have a higher quantity of sperm in the early morning. These points may apply to how matutinal mating is adaptive in other species. Similar behaviours have been observed in other species, such as in males of two species of dragonflies (Aeshna grandis & Aeshna viridis). They engage in matutinal searching flights each morning until they find a receptive female to mate with. A similar phenomenon is seen in male praying mantises, where they respond to the emerging light each morning by increasing flight activity. = Matutinal Foraging = Some animals exhibit increased foraging behaviour during the matutinal hours. Some examples of why this may be adaptive are: (1) it may increase predatory success and (2) competition for food may be reduced. A blue shark (Prionace glauca). These sharks spend more time at the ocean's surface during matutinal hours - likely for predatory reasons.  Predatory Adaptation  The blue shark (Prionace glauca) is a predator that primarily hunts during the pre-dawn to dawn period. During matutinal hours, they spend more time than any other point in the day at the surface of the ocean. It is likely that they are taking advantage of the increased density of prey at the water's surface during dawn. It is also possible that, since only a thin layer at the surface of the ocean is dimly lit during this twilight period, the shark (coming up from the dark ocean depths) has vision of the prey, but the prey do not have vision of the shark, allowing the shark to sneak up on the prey, increasing predatory success.  Reduced Competition  Some bees (e.g., Ptiloglossa arizonensis, Pt. jonesi, Caupolicana, and Hemihalictus lustrans) forage matutinally, possibly because there is less competition for food during this period. The Hemihalictus lustrans, for example, is a bee that works mutualistically with the dandellion Pyrrhopappus carolinianus during matutinal hours. Pyrrhopappus carolinianus flowers very early in the morning and Hemihalictus lustrans begins foraging at the same time. The bee tears open the dandellion's anthers just as it is flowering, which speeds up anthesis and ensures that it almost always has first claim to the dandellion's pollen.  Physiological Evidence of Adaptation  These matutinal behaviours may be induced by physiological adaptations. Robinson & Robinson reversed the day- night schedule of female tropical praying mantises (i.e., by placing them in light during the night, and in a chamber with no light during the day). After they adjusted to the schedule, the praying mantises were removed from their chambers at different times throughout the newly adjusted night period and placed in the light. Each praying mantis initiated their pheromone-emitting stance during this transition regardless of the time, which suggests that this behaviour depends solely on the transition from dark to light. The authors suggested that this was likely a physiological adaptation.

W. Post. The \\"camp\\", near Keese Mill, in the U.S. state of New York, was considered by Post to be a \\"rustic retreat\\"; it consisted of 68 buildings, including a fully staffed main lodge and private guest cabins, each staffed with its own butler. It was one of the largest of the Adirondack great camps and possibly the most elaborately furnished. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs The camp had and was situated on an esker between the Spectacle Ponds and Upper St. Regis Lake, about northwest of Saranac Lake, New York. As originally built, the property could only be reached by water, though a driveway was added in later years. Guests arrived by float-plane or Post's yacht at a private dock, and thence via funicular to the main building at the top of the ridge. Three times a week, guests would gather in the living room where full-length movies could be screened; an adjoining dining room seated thirty guests. Many of the original furnishings of the room, which included an extensive collection of American Indian artifacts, are now in the Smithsonian Institution. Among the many elaborate structures on the property is a Russian dacha built for Post's third husband, who had served as ambassador to the Soviet Union. The staff would arrive from Keese Mills Road in Paul Smiths and drive around the water and leave their cars in a parking lot, now used as public parking for the trail to St. Regis Mountain; the trail head is just before the private property line of Camp Topridge. From the parking lot, staff would walk a hilly, unpaved path into the workers' side of the camp. In the early 1970s, this unpaved path was widened and became suitable for one-way car traffic. Prior to the paving, vehicles could only be driven over the ice in the winter. Mrs Post's guests would arrive at Saranac Airport (in Lake Clear), often in her private Vickers Viscount, the Merriweather. They would be driven to a launch which would take them to one of the boat houses. From there, they could either take the stairs or ride a covered, six-person electronic lift or funicular, installed for Mrs. Post's aunt Molly Post, who suffered from heart trouble. When Mrs. Post was in camp, it provided employment to carpenters, painters, maids and general labor. For years, the caretaker of the camp and his wife would feed lunch to staff in a dining room in the caretaker's home and this was one of the benefits of working for Mrs. Post at the time. The estate was designed by local builder Ben Muncil in collaboration with New York architect Theodore Blake. Post left the property to the State of New York. The main lodge, most of the buildings and were offered for sale, with the remaining acreage to be made part of the Adirondack Forest Preserve. Roger Jakubowski purchased the Camp from the State of New York in 1985 for $911,000. It is now owned by Texas real estate magnate Harlan Crow, who has substantially restored the buildings and added a number of new ones. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.

Several car magazines were quick to turn these official gray scale pictures into computer generated images that show the Tribu in near final form, as a rebadged version of the Volkswagen Tiguan. The car did not subsequently reach production, due to rough economic conditions at the time. In March 2014, Auto Express reported that SEAT were working on a family of CUVs, with an estimated release date of 2016.

The device was invented and patented by George Dicker (for whom the device is named) of Orange County, California. The eponymous device was two and a half yards (90 inches) long. If a ball was placed on the 23-yard line, a marker would be placed 2 yards up the dicker-rod at the 25-yard line. Then, in order to measure whether a first down was attained, the dicker-rod would be laid down at the 35-yard line, and the spot of the ball would be measured against the marker on the rod, which would now be at the 33-yard line, 2 yards away from the 35-yard line. The dicker-rod was intended for safety as a ten yard length of chain laying along the sideline was a hazard for players. A full chain crew was not needed, and measurements could be completed by one person instead of the typical three. Despite its elegant simplicity, the dicker-rod never caught on outside of World Football League, and the three-man chain measurement crew remains the standard.

M. Bower, was an American author who wrote novels, fictional short stories, and screenplays about the American Old West. Her works, featuring cowboys and cows of the Flying U Ranch in Montana, reflected \\"an interest in ranch life, the use of working cowboys as main characters (even in romantic plots), the occasional appearance of eastern types for the sake of contrast, a sense of western geography as simultaneously harsh and grand, and a good deal of factual attention to such matters as cattle branding and bronc busting.\\" She was married three times: to Clayton Bower in 1890, to Bertrand William Sinclair (also a Western author) in 1905, and to Robert Elsworth Cowan in 1921. However, she chose to publish under the name Bower. Biography =Early life= Born Bertha Muzzy in Otter Tail County, Minnesota, to Washington Muzzy and Eunice Miner Muzzy, Bower moved with her family to a dryland homestead near Great Falls, Montana, in 1889. That fall, just before her eighteenth birthday, she began teaching school in nearby Milligan Valley. The school was a small, hastily converted log outbuilding, and she taught twelve pupils. Her experiences as a teacher informed the characters of schoolma'ams who appear frequently in her in the writings, notably in The North Wind Do Blow (1937), in which a young, eastern- born schoolma'am teaches her first term in central Montana. After one term as a schoolteacher, Bower returned to her family's homestead. =Marriages= On December 21, 1890, Bower shocked her family by eloping with her first husband, Clayton J. Bower. Their marriage was unhappy. The newlyweds lived first with the Muzzy family, moving later to Great Falls and then to Big Sandy, Montana, in 1898. Her experiences in Big Sandy gave her intimate knowledge of cowboy life on the open range. Bower gave birth to three children during her marriage to Clayton: Bertha Grace in 1891, Harold Clayton in 1893, and Roy Noel in 1896. Eventually, Clayton moved the family to a lonely hayfield cabin, which Bower nicknamed \\"Bleak Cabin,\\" about a mile out of Big Sandy. To help with rent, the Bowers accepted a boarder named Bill Sinclair. Sinclair, aged twenty-two, was nine years younger than Bower, but nevertheless a partnership began between them. Bower lent books to Sinclair and tutored him in writing while he helped her understand the finer points of cowpunching and critiqued the Western stories she had begun to write. In the meantime, Bower's first marriage had deteriorated. After Bower had published Chip of the Flying U, her husband had begun to call her \\"my little red-headed gold mine.\\" The final break came after he arrived home in a drunken rage. With Sinclair's help and with money from the sale of Chip of the Flying U, Bower moved to Tacoma, Washington, to stay with her brother Chip and his wife Elvina. The divorce was finalized in 1905. Clayton took custody of Bertha Grace and Harry, while Bower moved back to Great Falls and took custody of Roy. Throughout this difficult time, Bower continued to advance her career, signing her first short-story writing contract for Popular Magazine in January 1905. Bower and Sinclair married on August 13, 1905, at the Great Falls Methodist-Episcopal Church. They rented a two-story home at 111 Sixth Street North where they both focused on their writing careers. A daughter, Della Frances Sinclair, was born during a blizzard on January 24, 1907. That same hard winter destroyed the Sinclairs' breeding horse herd on land in eastern Valley County where they had hoped to move in the spring. After losing their herd, Bower and Sinclair left Montana for good and moved south and settled in a house on the coast in Santa Cruz, California. Both Bower and Sinclair continued to pursue successful careers as writers over the course of several moves to various houses in California. However, by late summer, 1911, Bower had separated from Sinclair and rented a house in San Jose, California. She also changed publishers, signing with the prestigious Boston publishing house Little, Brown & Company in August 1911. In 1920, Bower moved to Hollywood and married her third husband, Robert \\"Bud\\" Cowan, a cowboy who she had met in Big Sandy. In 1921, Bower and Cowan reopened a silver mine in Nevada and operated it for several years until the Great Depression forced them to move again, this time to Depoe Bay, Oregon. Their marriage lasted until Cowan's death in 1939. Bower did not remarry again. =Writing career= Bower began writing to \\"save my sanity\\" after moving to Big Sandy with her first husband. Seeking financial independence from Clayton, she began sending stories to publishers in 1900. She regularly wrote new material while continuing to send out her old stories once a month. Bower published her first short story, \\"Strike of the Dishpan Brigade,\\" locally in 1901. Her first short story to be published nationally, \\"Ghost in the Red Shirt,\\" appeared in Lippincott‚Äôs Magazine in 1904. Later that year, Bower published her first Western novel, Chip of the Flying U, as a serial in Popular Magazine by Street & Smith. The book introduced readers to the fictional Flying U Ranch and the \\"Happy Family\\" of cowboys who lived there. The story line centers on a cowboy named Chip and his relationship with Dr. Della Whitmore, a self-reliant doctor from the East who \\"can shoot a coyote, laugh off a hazing, doctor a horse, and turn cowboys into pediatric orderlies.\\" Their relationship begins coldly when Della takes credit for a painting done by Chip. But they fall in love after Della restores credit to Chip and after Chip rescues Della from a runaway horse. The book was so popular that it was re-released in hardcover in 1906 with three watercolor illustrations by famed painter Charlie Russell. Chip of the Flying U rocketed Bower to fame, and she wrote an entire series of novels set at the Flying U Ranch. Bower went on to write 57 Western novels. She died in July 1940 in Los Angeles, California, at the age of 68.William Bloodworth, \\"Bower, B(ertha nee) M(uzzy), in Twentieth Century Western Writers, edited by Geoff Sadler. Chicago and London, St. James Press, 1991, (pp.73-5) By the time of her death, her books had sold more than two million copies, not counting her many short stories and articles. According to Elmer Kelton, Bower's sales dropped when it was revealed that she was female. =Hollywood= Several of Bower's novels were turned into films.Current biography: who's news and why, 1940 Chip of the Flying U was adapted for film four times; however, each of these films significantly altered Bower's narrative. Bower also collaborated with director Colin Campbell, writing stories and screenplays for seven Westerns under the name Bertha Muzzy Sinclair. She developed friendships with Gary Cooper and Tom Mix. Mix starred in the first adaptation of Chip of the Flying U (1914) as well as in three other films written by Bower: When the Cook Fell Ill (1914), The Lonesome Trail (1914), and Weary Goes A‚ÄôWooing (1915). Bower used her experiences working within the studio system as the source material for several novels, including Jean of the Lazy A (1915), The Heritage of the Sioux (1915), The Phantom Herd (1915), and The Quirt (1920). Writing Style Bower's novels have been praised for their accurate portrayal of cowboy life. She wrote factually about such things as cattle branding and bronc busting, having witnessed these events firsthand. Bower's West is a place of change in which characters embrace new technologies from barbed wire to Kodak cameras. She infused her novels with humor. Her cowboys lightheartedly josh each other, and readers are invited to laugh at the ironic situations in which her characters are entangled. There is little violence in Bower's writing. In Chip of the Flying U, the eponymous character does not even carry a six-shooter. Instead, Bower's writing is characterized by a lighthearted, pleasant mood. For example, in describing a ranch kitchen, she imagines a tea kettle \\"singing placidly to itself and puffing steam with an air of lazy comfort, as if it were smoking a cigarette.\\" Reviewers praised Bower for her use of \\"chaste English,\\" her \\"true-to-life fiction,\\" her \\"real background of life among the bow-legged brethren,\\" and her \\"playful, humorous vein.\\" A 1922 New York Times review stated: \\"there has always been an authenticity about them, a genuine smell of sagebrush and saddle leather, which many of her pretentious rivals lack. Her humor, too, is native and unforced, and lingers in the mind.\\" Both readers and reviewers frequently assumed that Bower was a man. In 1926, a reviewer for the New York Times called Bower \\"a strong but not altogether silent man who, during the intermissions in his professional duties, has found time to write thirty-four books.\\" Other reviewers dodged the question entirely by replacing the pronouns he or she with such vague epithets as \\"this veteran novelist.\\" Works *Adam Chasers: 1927 *The Bellehelen Mine: 1924 *Black Thunder: 1926 *Border Vengeance: 1951 (Ghost written by Oscar Friend) *Cabin Fever: 1918 *Casey Ryan: 1921 *Chip of the Flying U: 1906 *Cow Country: 1921 *Dark Horse: 1931 *Desert Brew: 1925 *The Dry Ridge Gang: 1935 *The Eagle's Wing: 1924 *The Family Failing: 1941 *Five Furies of Leaning Ladder: 1936 *Flying U Ranch: 1914 *The Flying U Strikes: 1933 *The Flying U's Last Stand: 1915 *Fool's Goal: 1930 *Good Indian: 1912 *The Gringos: 1913 *The Happy Family: 1910 *The Haunted Hills: 1934 *Hay Wire: 1928 *Her Prairie Knight: 1909 *The Heritage of the Sioux: 1916 *Jean Of The Lazy ‚ÄòA‚Äô: 1915 *Laughing Water: 1932 *Lonesome Land: 1912 *The Lonesome Trail: 1909 *The Long Loop: 1931 *The Long Shadow: 1909 *The Lookout Man: 1917 *The Lure of the Dim Trails: 1907 *Man on Horseback: 1940 *Meadowlark Basin: 1925 *The North Wind Do Blow: 1937 *Open Land: 1933 *Outlaw Moon: 1952 (Ghost written by Oscar Friend) *The Parowan Bonanza: 1923 *The Phantom Herd: 1916 *Pirates of the Range: 1937 *Points West: 1928 *The Quirt: 1920 *The Ranch at the Wolverine: 1914 *The Range Dwellers: 1906 *Rim O' the World: 1919 *Rocking Arrow: 1932 *Rodeo: 1928 *Rowdy of the Cross L: 1907 *Shadow Mountain: 1936 *The Singing Hill: 1939 *Sky Rider: 1918 *Spirit of the Range: 1940 *Starr of the Desert: 1917 *A Starry Night: 1939 *The Swallowfork Bulls: 1929 *Sweet Grass: 1940 *The Thunder Bird: 1919 *Tiger Eye: 1930 *The Trail of the White Mule: 1922 *Trails Meet: 1933 *Trouble Rides the Wind: 1935 *The Uphill Climb: 1913 *Van Patten: 1926 *The Voice at Johnny Water: 1923 *White Wolves: 1927 *The Whoop- Up Trail: 1933 *The Wind Blows West: 1938 References External links   Books by B.

He was accorded the rank ollamh seanchai (professional historian) to the U√≠ Maine recorded Irish clan history up until the Norman invasion of Ireland. His work √ì Dubhag√°in's most important work is Triallam timcheall na Fodla, a compilation of verse, giving the names of the various tribes, dynasties and territories of the Irish, and the various chiefs before the coming of the Normans. He devotes 152 lines to Meath, 354 to Ulster, 328 to Connacht, and only 56 to Leinster, possibly unfinished at his death. Triallam is notable, in that he writes as though the Norman invasion never occurred, and as if many of the families listed still occupied their original territories. This, however, may reflect his interest as an antiquarian preserving ancient lore. His contemporary, Giolla na Naomh √ì hUidhr√≠n (died 1420), completed it. In Cambrensis Eversus, John Lynch says that he could not find \\"any better source than this remarkable poem\\" concerning the chief Irish families before the coming of the English. √ì Dubhag√°in was the author of several other extant poems, all more or less in the nature of a memoria technica, valuable chiefly for their facts about the kings of Ireland and of the provinces. They include: * Righnaid Laigean Clan Cathaoir, on the families descended from King Cathair M√≥r of Leinster. * Cashil cathain clana Mogh, a catalogue of the kings of Cashel from c.300 to 1367. At least three other poems by him are extant, amounting to several hundreds of verses. He also composed several rules for determining moveable feasts. He was the teacher of Adhamh √ì Cian√°in, who composed Leabhar Adhamh √ì Cian√°in, in or about the 1340s. √ì Cian√°in stated that he wrote it by and for himself, and out of a book of his teacher.

The Park included a double track wooden roller coaster, a theater pavilion, a ridable miniature railway and boat livery. History Ramona Park at Night, Reeds Lake, East Grand Rapids, MI. Ramona Park was located on the west shore of Reeds Lake in East Grand Rapids, Michigan, and owned and operated by the Grand Rapids Street Railway Company, a trolley park By 1921 the Ramona Amusement Corporation was formed and managed by the Railway Company. Trolley parks were common in the United States from the late 1800s into the mid twentieth century. Local transportation companies received fares for patrons riding the trolleys and also park admittance fees. A good example of a trolley park is Coney Island. Through the years people traveled to Reeds Lake and Ramona Park from Grand Rapids and other cities in West Michigan, first using horse-drawn trams, street steam railroad, interurban, electric streetcars or trolleys and finally, by the mid-1930s, city buses. The cars and bus routes were always, and still remain today, number 6. Reeds Lake was a summertime destination spot for years before the Park was established. The Lake was several miles from the city of Grand Rapids. There were picnic grounds, pavilions for entertainment, and boat liveries that supplied flat-bottomed skiff boats. As early as the 1850s passenger steam boats carried up to several hundred passengers. Captain John Honore Poisson was followed by his sons, Charles and Joseph, and grandsons, John and William as excursion steam boat captains. Reeds Lake, East Grand Rapids, MI., was a favorite summer-time destination. In 1872 the Reeds Lake and Grand Rapids Railway was established and used horse powered trams. A 10-ton steam engine, powerful enough to pull three open train cars all the way to Reeds Lake, was introduced in 1877. Future President of the United States Gerald Ford (then Leslie King) worked at Ramona Park. In 1954 the citizens of East Grand Rapids voted to close the park and raze it in favor of residential apartments and retail stores and shopping centers. Features The original wooden roller coaster was a single track in a figure eight, which operated beginning in 1903. The Giant Coaster was built in 1913, and Ingersoll's Derby Racer in 1914. It was soon renamed the Jack Rabbit Derby Racer. Jack Rabbit was a double wooden-track roller coaster with an 80 percent drop, and it stood out as the most popular ride at the park and was one of only two double track roller coasters in the country. The Ramona Theatre Pavilion sat majestically on the East Side of the Park on Lakeside Drive, near the boat landing and overlooking Reeds Lake. It was an extremely popular summertime venue that could seat 1,700 people. Popular plays, musicals, Vaudeville and burlesque acts, silent films, talkies and favorite local and national entertainers, such as Will Rogers, appeared at the theatre during its heyday. Detail of plat map of Kent County, MI showing detail of Reeds Lake amusement park. The Point Paulo resort was also located along the shores of Reeds Lake in the early 1900s, and was created as vacation spot for touring actors. Frederick Paulo and Maurice Bellclaire developed the colony, which had over thirty cabins during the height of its popularity. =The Midway= The midway was located as an extension of where Barnard Street boat landing is now. Mid-way amusement rides included: *Flying Scooters *Figure 8 roller coaster *Venetian Swings *Ferris wheel *Aero-swings *Kiddie Auto *Merry-go-round *Mystic Chutes *Loop- O-Plane *Fun House *Games of chance *Food Concessions =Roller Coaster= Jack Rabbit Derby Racer at Ramona Park, East Grand Rapids, MI.

It was enclosed in the early 1900s and became a popular attraction. On July 16, 1905, the Leroy Trio, made up of drag performer Gene Leroy, and two teenage singers, Johnnie Morris and Julius Marx, performed at the Ramona Theatre, which was Groucho Marx's professional debut. Many Vaudeville acts performed there during the 1920s and 1930s. Celebrities such as Edgar Bergen, the Marx Brothers, Jimmy Durante, Joan Davis, Jack Benny, Fred Allen and Will Rogers plied their talents here, along with Buster Keaton, Fanny Brice, and many others. The A.B. Marcus shows were extremely popular during the 1930s and 1940s. Troupes of beautiful girls sang and danced at stage shows that were priced at 10 to 50 cents per show. In the early days one could even see movies there. =Ridable Miniature Railroad= The Ramona Park Railway miniature locomotive was always a hit with the crowds, carrying as many as 50,000 people a year in its heyday. This made to scale steam locomotive and the open cars could carry 30 or more people on a half mile ride through and around the park. It was owned and operated by the Harry D. Glidden Family of East Grand Rapids. =Baseball= The Detroit Tigers stage a \\"home\\" Sunday game there on May 24, 1903. Founder Benjamin Hanchett was the President and General Manager of the Grand Rapids Street Railway Company 4 and an important Ramona Park developer. He began management of the Company in 1904. The Park began to flourish under his direction. Hanchett was a resident of East Grand Rapids and served as its Village President from 1908 to 1911; and was a Director of Old Kent Bank, Regent of the University of Michigan and was a direct descendant of the Jenison family, Jenison, Michigan. Current Day As of 2013, Ramona Park spanned these properties: D&W; grocery store, Jade Pig Ventures and Property (former Jacobson‚Äôs Department Store), Lakeshore Club Condominiums and Lakewood Apartments, and the former Ramona Medical Center property. It was bordered by Wealthy Street on the south, Lovett Avenue on the west and Lakeside Drive on the east. Gaslight Village, strip malls, condos, apartments, and D&W; Grocery store now sit where Ramona once was. The East Grand Rapids branch of the Kent District Library has a room dedicated to the amusement park with artifacts. \\"Big Bertha\\", an amusement park organ built in Paris that operated at Ramona, is now located at Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa at the Walt Disney World Resort in the restaurant 1900 Park Fare.

Added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 as a \\"significant example\\" of Colonial Revival architecture as applied to commercial buildings, the Schuster building is one of Louisville's most prominent examples of that style. The Colonial Revival style was part of an emerging trend in American design at the time the building was completed in 1927, and was later popularized by the restoration of Colonial Williamsburg. In the years following the completion of the Schuster Building, several prominent structures in the same style were built in Louisville, such as the University of Louisville Administration Building in 1929, and Norton and Mullins halls of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in 1930. History The Schuster Building was designed by the Louisville firm of Nevin, Wischmeyer & Morgan, which also designed the Pendennis Club's clubhouse. Built in 1927, the Schuster Building was the largest of several mixed-use buildings that were built in the pre-World War II era along Bardstown Road, the commercial corridor of what was then Louisville's wealthiest suburban area, the Highlands. The building originally housed shops, professional offices, apartments and the Uptown Theater. The 1,100 seat Uptown was equipped for both live theater and film, with a full stage, orchestra pit and organ. =Decline and renovation= The Uptown Theater lobby entrance in 1979 The building changed little into the 1980s. As shops came and went, there were essentially no alterations to the upper floors and only minor ones to the ground floor. The Uptown Theater remained as the anchor of the building, but attendance tapered off over the years, and by the 1980s closure was inevitable. When the Uptown closed in 1989, it had survived longer than any other neighborhood theater in Louisville except the Vogue. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Highlands residents formed an organization to raise awareness and attempt to renovate and reopen the Uptown (at one point as a film museum named after Kentucky native D.W. Griffith), but were unable to raise the $1 million needed for the project. The planned renovation of the building, which involved demolishing the theater to create a parking lot, was stalled by a slow economy in the early 1990s. While the building was in limbo, several alternate uses were proposed, such as turning it into a public library branch, dance hall or a modern 8-screen cineplex. This uncertainty alarmed neighbors, and led to the building being listed in 1992 as one of the 10 \\"most- endangered\\" buildings in Louisville. The cineplex plan gained the most support, both from developers and local politicians, and for a while seemed to be in the serious planning stages. However, many neighbors opposed it, citing concerns about security, traffic and parking, and developers eventually dropped the cinema plan. In 1996, a modern multi-screen cinema opened a few blocks away, in the form of Baxter Avenue Theatres, now Baxter Avenue Filmworks, at Mid-City Mall. In 1994, the Uptown Theater was demolished, clearing a large space behind the building where a parking lot was built, and the property was revived when a restaurant and other businesses moved in. Apartments were removed from the second and third floors and converted to office space. Although the Uptown Theater has been demolished, the exterior of the building remains largely unmodified. The theater's lobby is now the dining room of a Qdoba restaurant, but the old ticket window can still be recognized as part of the storefront. Local influence As the landmark building in the area, the Schuster Building has influenced nearby development. Across the street, a Valvoline outlet was built with brick chosen to match the colors used in the Schuster Building. A large, mixed-use building on the opposite corner, called Highland Station, was designed to resemble the Schuster Building, with storefronts flush with the Bardstown Road sidewalk and an outdoor dining area and green space alongside Eastern Parkway.

K-9 is the second longest state highway after K-4. Route description K-9 as it passes through Blue Rapids with U.S. 77 K-9 and US 77 south of Marysville K-9 begins south of Dresden at K-123 on the border between Sheridan and Decatur counties. After starting out along the border, it gradually follows an east-northeast alignment, as the highway parallels the north fork of the Solomon River. After passing through Lenora, K-9 has a short overlap with US-283. It passes through Edmond and intersects K-173 near Densmore, then continues east through Logan and Speed. At Glade, K-9 intersects US-183. East of Glade, K-9 follows an east-southeast trajectory which goes north of Kirwin, then goes through Cedar and Gaylord before intersecting US-281. K-9 then goes southeast through Portis with US-281, then turns south. At US-24, K-9 turns east with US-24, ending its overlap with US-281.

East of Centralia, K-9 intersects K-63, and they overlap going south into Corning. K-9 then turns east at Corning, and then intersects K-62 southwest of Goff. It goes northeast into Goff, then goes southeasterly through Wetmore before intersecting US-75 near Netawaka. K-9 continues southeast through Netawaka, then turns east through Whiting. Near Muscotah, K-9 intersects US-159, then they turn south together through Muscotah. They then overlap going east, then south into Effingham. East of Effingham, the K-9/US-159 overlap ends, and K-9 alternates between northbound and eastbound alignments on its way towards Lancaster, ending south of Lancaster at US-73. The Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) tracks the traffic levels on its highways, and in 2018, they determined that on average the traffic varied from 170 vehicles per day near the western terminus to 4850 vehicles per day slightly east of US-81. The second highest was 4740 vehicles per day slightly east of K-14. The section of K-9 along the overlap with US-24 and the overlap with US-77 is included in the National Highway System.

In addition to the worship of the Classical pantheon of the Greek deities found on their coins (e.g., Zeus, Herakles, Athena, Apollo), the Indo-Greeks were involved with local faiths, particularly with Buddhism, but also with Hinduism and Zoroastrianism. Buddhism After the Greco- Bactrians militarily occupied parts of northern India from around 180 BCE, numerous instances of interaction between Greeks and Buddhism are recorded. =The conversion of Menander= Indian-standard coinage of Menander I with an eight-spoked wheel and a palm of victory on the reverse (British Museum). Menander I, the \\"Saviour king\\", is documented to have converted to Buddhism, and is described in Buddhist texts as a great benefactor of the religion. Menander, appears to have proselytized the faith through his domain similar to the Mauryan Ashoka and the future Kushan emperor Kanishka. He is famous for his dialogues with the Buddhist monk Nagasena, transmitted to us in the Milinda Panha, which explain that he became a Buddhist arhat: Another Indian writing, the Stupavadana of Ksemendra, mentions in the form of a prophecy that Menander will build a stupa in Pataliputra.Stupavadana, Chapter 57, v15. Quotes in E.Seldeslachts. Evolution of the Butkara stupa, a large part of which occurred during the Indo-Greek period, with the addition of Hellenistic architectural elements. Plutarch also presents Menander as an example of benevolent rule, and explains that upon his death, the honour of sharing his remains was claimed by the various cities under his rule, and they were enshrined in \\"monuments\\" (ŒºŒΩŒ∑ŒºŒµŒØŒ±, probably stupas), in a parallel with the historic Buddha: The Butkara stupa was \\"monumentalized\\" by the addition of Hellenistic architectural decorations during Indo-Greek rule in 2nd century BCE.\\"De l'Indus a l'Oxus: archaeologie de l'Asie Centrale\\", Pierfrancesco Callieri, p212: \\"The diffusion, from the second century BCE, of Hellenistic influences in the architecture of Swat is also attested by the archaeological searches at the sanctuary of Butkara I, which saw its stupa \\"monumentalized\\" at that exact time by basal elements and decorative alcoves derived from Hellenistic architecture\\". Some Buddhist inscriptions also mention the name of Menander, suggesting intense Buddhist activity under his sponsorship: =Buddhist proselytism= There are records of the involvement of Greeks in Buddhist pilgrimages. During the reign of Menander, the Greek (Pali: Yona, lit: \\"Ionian\\") Buddhist monk Mahadhammarakkhita (Sanskrit: Mahadharmaraksita, lit. \\"Great protector of the Dharma\\") is said to have come from Alasandra (thought to be Alexandria of the Caucasus, the city founded by Alexander the Great, near today's Kabul) with 30,000 monks for the foundation ceremony of the Maha Thupa (\\"Great stupa\\") built by king Dutthagamani at Anuradhapura in Sri Lanka around 130 BCE, indicating the importance of Buddhism within Greek communities in northwestern India, and the prominent role Greek Buddhist monks played in them: According to the Mahavamsa, the Great Stupa in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka, was dedicated by a 30,000-strong \\"Yona\\" delegation from \\"Alexandria\\" around 130 BCE. Several Buddhist dedications by Greeks in India are recorded, such as that of the Greek meridarch (civil governor of part of a province) named Theodorus, describing in Kharoshthi how he enshrined relics of the Buddha. The inscriptions were found on a vase inside a stupa, dated to the reign of Menander or one of his successors in the 1st century BCE (Tarn, p391): Although the spread of Buddhism to Central Asia and Northern Asia is usually associated with the Kushans, a century or two later, there is a possibility that it may have been introduced in those areas from Gandhara \\"even earlier, during the time of Demetrius and Menander\\" (Puri, \\"Buddhism in Central Asia\\"). There is however some textual evidence to suggest that Buddhism had penetrated much earlier to Central Asia, at least in a limited form: the first two disciples of the Buddha were named Tapassu and Bhallika, from the region of Balhika (the present Balkh, and Sanskrit for Bactria), and though it cannot necessarily be presumed that any extensive prosyletization occurred on their return journey, that the Sanskrit name for Bactria derived from the name of a Bactrian-Buddhist disciple is suggestive of some early influence. Bhallika and Tapassu were both travellers, and if nothing else, the story of their conversion and their home region's Sanskrit nomenclature illustrates the possibility of early transmission via the local trade routes. =Buddhist symbolism= Agathocles, with Buddhist lion and HIndu goddess Lakshmi. Agathocles, with Chaitya-hill, and tree in railing. From around 180 BCE, Agathocles and Pantaleon, probable successors to Demetrius I in the Paropamisadae, and the earliest Greek kings to issue Indian-standard square bilingual coins (in Brahmi), depicted the Buddhist lion together with the Hindu goddess Lakshmi. Some coins of Agathocles in the Indian standard also show a six-arched stupa and a tree in a railing, typical symbol of the Bodhi tree in early Buddhism.\\"Distinctively Indian religious types seems to occur on the coins struck by two of the Greek princes- \\"the tree in railing\\" and the \\"Chaitya\\" on certain coins of Agathocles and the \\"Wheel\\" which has been reasonably idenditfied with \\"the wheel of the Law\\" (Dharma-chakra) of Buddhism, on one of the numerous currencies of Menander\\" Hellenism in ancient India, Banerjee, p136 These coins show an unprecedented willingness to adapt to every aspect of the local culture: shape of the coinage, coinage size, language, and religion. Silver Drachm of Menander II 90‚Äì85 BCE with Zeus enthroned, holding Nike and scepter, and Nike handing a victory wreath over an eight-spoked wheelBopearachchi 4A and note 4; Bopearachchi & Rahman -; SNG ANS Later, some Indo-Greek coins incorporate the Buddhist symbol of the eight- spoked wheel, such as those of Menander I, as well as his possible grandson Menander II. On these coins, the wheel is associated with the Greek symbols of victory, either the palm of victory, or the victory wreath handed over by the goddess Nike. This symbology has led some to conclude that Menander adopted the Buddhist mantle of a \\"Chakravartin\\" during his lifetime; lit., \\"one for whom the wheel of law turns,\\" translated as \\"King of the Wheel\\" in Western texts. The ubiquitous symbol of the elephant may or may not have been associated with Buddhism. On some coin series of Antialcidas, the elephant holds the same relationship to Zeus and Nike as the Buddhist wheel on the coin of Menander II, tending to suggest a common meaning for both symbols. Some of the earlier coins of king Apollodotus I directly associate the elephant with Buddhist symbolism, such as the stupa hill surmounted by a star, also seen, for example on the coins of the Mauryan Empire or those of the later Kuninda kingdom. Conversely, the bull is probably associated with Shiva, and often described in an erectile state as on the coins of Apollodotus I. Also, after the reign of Menander I, several Indo-Greek rulers, such as Agathokleia, Amyntas, Nicias, Peukolaos, Hermaeus, Hippostratos, Menander II and Philoxenus depicted themselves or their Greek deities forming with the right hand a benediction gestureMentioned in Bopearachchi identical to the Buddhist vitarka mudra (thumb and index joined together, with other fingers extended), which in Buddhism signifies the transmission of the Buddha's teaching. Indian relief of probable Indo-Greek king (Susan Huntington, \\"The art of ancient India\\"), with Buddhist triratana symbol on his sword. Barhut stupa, 2nd century BCE. Indian Museum, Calcutta (drawing). At precisely the same time, right after the death of Menander, several Indo-Greek rulers also started to adopt on their coins the Pali title of \\"Dharmikasa\\", meaning \\"follower of the Dharma\\" (the title of the great Indian Buddhist king Ashoka was Dharmaraja \\"King of the Dharma\\").\\"Crossroads of Asia\\", p12. Also in \\"Taxila\\", by John Marshall: \\"By this time, both the title (Dharmikasa) and the symbol (the Dharmachakra) were indissolubly associated with Buddhism and their use was quite enough to proclaim the king's adherence to that religion\\", p33 This usage was adopted by Strato I, Zoilos I, Heliokles II, Theophilos, Peukolaos, Menander II and Archebios. Vitarka Mudra, on Indo-Greek coinage. Top: Divinities Tyche and Zeus. Bottom: Depiction of Indo-Greek kings Nicias and Menander II. Altogether, the conversion of Menander I to Buddhism suggested by the Milinda Panha seems to have triggered the use of Buddhist symbolism in one form or another on the coinage of close to half of the kings who succeeded him. Especially, all the kings after Menander who are recorded to have ruled in Gandhara (apart from the little-known Demetrius III) display Buddhist symbolism in one form or another. On the contrary, none of the kings whose rule was limited to Punjab did display Buddhist signs, with the exception of the powerful Hippostratos, who probably took under his protection many Gandharan Greeks fleeing from the Indo-Scythians.Tarn A 2nd century BCE relief from a Buddhist stupa in Bharhut, in eastern Madhya Pradesh (today at the Indian Museum in Calcutta), represents a foreign soldier with the curly hair of a Greek and the royal headband with flowing ends of a Greek king. In his left hand, he holds a branch of ivy, symbol of Dionysos. Also parts of his dress, with rows of geometrical folds, are characteristically Hellenistic in style. On his sword appears the Buddhist symbol of the three jewels, or Triratana. Foreigners on the Northern Gateway of Stupa I at Sanchi. One frieze of Sanchi, dated to the 2nd century BCE during the Satavahana period, also shows devotees in Greek attire and activities. The men are depicted with short curly hair, often held together with a headband of the type commonly seen on Greek coins. The clothing too is Greek, complete with tunics, capes and sandals. The musical instruments are also quite characteristic, such as the double flute called aulos. Also visible are Carnyx-like horns. They are all celebrating at the entrance of the stupa. These men would probably be nearby Indo-Greeks.\\"A guide to Sanchi\\" John Marshall. These \\"Greek-looking foreigners\\" are also described in Susan Huntington, \\"The art of ancient India\\", p. 100 =Representation of the Buddha= One of the first known representations of the Buddha, Gandhara, in pure Hellenistic style and technique: Standing Buddha (Tokyo National Museum). Height: about 1 meter. The Indo-Greek may have initiated anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha in statuary, possibly as soon as the 2nd-1st century BCE, according to Foucher and others. Stupa constructions of the time of Menander, such as the Butkara stupa, incorporated niches which were intended to place statue or friezes, an indication of early Buddhist descriptive art during the time of the Indo- Greeks.\\"They (the niches) were intended to hold a figured panel, relief-work, or something of the kind\\" Domenico Facenna, \\"Butkara I\\" Also Chinese murals are known which describe Emperor Wu of Han worshipping Buddha statues brought from Central Asia in 120 BCE. A Chinese fresco in the Mogao Caves indicates that gilded statues of the Buddha were brought to China from Central Asia in 120 BCE. Foucher especially considered Hellenistic free-standing Buddhas as \\"the most beautiful, and probably the most ancient of the Buddhas\\", assigning them to the 2nd to 1st century BCE during the reign of Menander, and making them the starting point of the anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha: The willingness of ancient Greeks to represent and worship local deities is also attested in Egypt with the creation of the god Serapis in Hellenistic style, an adaptation of the Egyptian god Apis, or in Phrygia with the Hellenistic representation of the heretofore aniconic Cybele. On the contrary, Indian Buddhist art was traditionally aniconic (the Buddha was only represented with symbols), and the Iranian tradition (represented by the 1st century Indo-Parthians) also did not represent their deities in human form.\\"Contrary to Iran, the Greco-Bactrian cults often employ representations of their deities\\". An Indo-Chinese tradition also explains that Nagasena, also known as Menander's Buddhist teacher, created in 43 BCE in the city of Pataliputra a statue of the Buddha, the Emerald Buddha, which was later brought to Thailand. An Indo-Corinthian capital from the Butkara Stupa, representing a Buddhist devotee within foliage, dated to 20 BCE (Turin City Museum of Ancient Art).The capital has been found with a reliquary and a coin of Azes II buried at its base, securely dating the sculpture to earlier than 20 BCE. The Turin City Museum of Ancient Art: Text and photographic reference: Terre Lontane > O2 Stylistically, Indo-Greek coins generally display a very high level of Hellenistic artistic realism, which declined drastically around 50 BCE with the invasions of the Indo-Scythians, Yuezhi and Indo-Parthians. The first known statues of the Buddha are also very realistic and Hellenistic in style and are more consistent with the pre-50 BCE artistic level seen on coins. This would tend to suggest that the first statues were created between 130 BCE (death of Menander) and 50 BCE, precisely at the time when Buddhist symbolism appeared on Indo-Greek coinage. From that time, Menander and his successors may have been the key propagators of Buddhist ideas and representations: \\"the spread of Gandhari Buddhism may have been stimulated by Menander's royal patronage, as may have the development and spread of Gandharan sculpture, which seems to have accompanied it\\" (Mc Evilly, \\"The shape of ancient thought\\", p378) The Bimaran casket, representing the Buddha may be Indo-Greek work from around 30-10 BCE. British Museum. The representation of the Buddha may also be connected to his progressive deification, which is usually associated with the spread of the Indian principle of Bhakti (personal devotion to a deity). Bhakti is a principle which evolved in the Bhagavata religious movement, and is said to have permeated Buddhism from about 100 BCE, and to have been a contributing factor to the representation of the Buddha in human form. The association of the Indo-Greeks with the Bhagavata movement is documented in the inscription of the Heliodorus pillar, made during the reign of the Indo-Greek king Antialcidas (r.c. 115-95 BCE). At that time relations with the Shungas seem to have improved, and some level of religious exchange seems to have occurred. The point of time when bhakti fervour would have encountered the Hellenistic artistic tradition would then be around 100 BCE. Most of the early images of the Buddha (especially those of the standing Buddha) are anepigraphic, which makes it difficult to have a definite datation. The earliest known image of the Buddha with approximate indications on date is the Bimaran casket, which has been found buried with coins of the Indo-Scythian king Azes II (or possibly Azes I), indicating a 30-10 BCE date,\\"In the art of Gandhara, the first known image of the standing Buddha and approximatively dated, is that of the Bimaran reliquary, which specialists attribute to the Indo-Scythian period, more particularly to the rule of Azes II\\" (Christine Sachs, \\"De l'Indus √† l'Oxus\\"). although this date is not undisputed. Such datation, as well as the general Hellenistic style and attitude of the Buddha on the Bimaran casket (Hellenistic treatment of the dress, contrapposto attitude) would make it a possible Indo-Greek work, used in dedications by Indo- Scythians right after the end of Indo-Greek rule in the area of Gandhara. Since it already displays quite a sophisticated iconography (Brahma and ≈öakra as attendants, Bodhisattvas) in an advanced style, it would suggest much earlier representations of the Buddha were already current by that time, going back to the rule of the Indo-Greeks (Alfred A. Foucher and others): The question of coinage chiton, with the Buddhist goddess Hariti.\\"The Crossroads of Asia\\", p141 Punjab, 2nd century BCE-2nd century CE. British Museum. Devotee circambulating a Stupa. The anthropomorphic representation of the Buddha is totally absent from Indo-Greek coinage. This could suggest that the Indo-Greek kings respected the Indian aniconic rule for Buddhist depictions, limiting themselves to Buddhist symbolism only (the dharma wheel, the seated lion). According to this perspective, the actual depiction of the Buddha would be a later phenomenon, usually dated to the 1st century CE, emerging from the sponsorship of the Indo-Scythians, Indo-Parthians and Kushans and executed by Greek, and, later, Indian and possibly Roman artists. Datation of Greco-Buddhist statues is generally uncertain, but they are at least firmly established from the 1st century CE. Another possibility is that the Indo-Greeks may not have considered the Buddha strictly as a God, but rather as an essentially human sage or philosopher, in line with the traditional Nikaya Buddhist doctrine. Just as philosophers were routinely represented in statues (but certainly not on coins) in Antiquity, the image of the Buddha would naturally have occurred on statuary only. Lastly, the Indo- Greeks did at the beginning represent Indian (Hindu) deities on their coins (coins of Agathocles c. 180 BCE), but this happened only once, and the experiment was never repeated again by any king.Boppearachchi Although they are known to have been sympathetic to Indian religions in general, the Indo- Greeks apparently chose, for whatever reason, not to represent Indian deities on their coinage anymore. Hinduism Coin of Agathocles with Hindu deities: Balarama-Samkarshana (left) and Vasudeva-Krishna (right). A Jain Temple at Sirkap, part of the Indo-Greek kingdom, near modern-day Taxila, Punjab, Pakistan The first known bilingual coins of the Indo-Greeks were issued by Agathocles around 180 BCE. These coins were found in Ai-Khanoum, the great Greco-Bactrian city in northeastern Afghanistan, but introduce for the first time an Indian script (the Brahmi script which had been in use under the Mauryan empire). The coinage depict various Indian iconography: Krishna- Vasudeva, with his large wheel with six spokes (chakra) and conch (shanka), and his brother Sankarshan-Balarama, with his plough (hala) and pestle (masala), both early avatars of Vishnu.The Crossroads of Asia, p62 The square coins, instead of the usual Greek round coins, also followed the Indian standard for coinage. The dancing girls on some of the coins of Agathocles and Pantaleon are also sometimes considered as representations of Subhadra, Krishna's sister. These first issues were in several respects a short-lived experiment. Hindu anthropomorphic deities were never again represented in Indo-Greek coinage (although the bull on the vast quantity of subsequent coins may have symbolized Shiva, as the elephant may have symbolized Buddhism. Alternatively the bull, according to Foucher, represents the birth of the Buddha, which happened during the month of Vaicakha (April‚ÄìMay), known to Buddhists as Vesak, under the zodiacal sign of the Taurus, during the full moon),\\"The beginnings of Buddhist Art\\" Alfred Foucher, Plate I and the Brahmi script was immediately replaced by the Kharoshti script, derived from Aramaic. The general practice however of minting bilingual coins and combining Greek and Indian iconography, sometimes in the Greek and sometimes in the Indian standard continued for the next two centuries. In any case, these coins suggest the strong presence of Indian religious traditions in the northwestern Indian subcontinent at that time, and the willingness of the Greeks to acknowledge and even promote them. Artistically, they tend to indicate that the Greeks were not particularly reluctant to make representations of local deities, which has some bearing on the later emergence of the image of the Buddha in Hellenistic style. The Heliodorus pillar inscription is another epigraphical evidence of the interaction between Greeks and Hinduism. The pillar was erected around 110 BCE in central India at the site of Vidisha, by Heliodorus, a Greek ambassador of the Indo-Greek king Antialcidas to the court of the Shunga king Bhagabhadra. The pillar was surmounted by a sculpture of Garuda and was apparently dedicated by Heliodorus to the temple of Vasudeva. :\\"This Garuda-standard of Vasudeva (Vishnu), the God of Gods :was erected here by the Bhagavata Heliodoros, :the son of Dion, a man of Taxila, :sent by the Great Greek (Yona) King :Antialkidas, as ambassador to :King Kasiputra Bhagabhadra, the Savior :son of the princess from Benares, in the fourteenth year of his reign.\\" :(Heliodorus pillar inscription) Zoroastrianism Ionic columns at Jandial near Sirkap, Taxila. This temple is usually considered to have been a Zoroastriasm temple. Greater Iranian culture and religion seem to have been rather influential among the Western Indo-Greeks, who, located around the Paropamisadae, lived in direct contact with the Central Asian cultural sphere and the eastern reaches of the Parthian empire. Images of the Zoroastrian divinity Mithra - depicted with a radiated phrygian cap - appear extensively on the Indo-Greek coinage of the Western kings. This Zeus-Mithra is also the one represented seated (with the gloriole around the head, and a small protrusion on the top of the head representing the cap) on many coins of Hermaeus, Antialcidas or Heliokles II, or possibly even earlier during the time of Eucratides I, on whose coins the figure is identified as the patron divinity of the city of Kapisa. The future Buddha Maitreya, usually represented seated on a throne Western-style, and venerated both in Mahayana and non-Mahayana Buddhism, is sometimes considered as influenced by Mithra. \\"Some scholars suggest he (Maitreya) was originally linked to the Iranian saviour-figure Mitra, and that his later importance for Buddhist as the future Buddha residing in the Tusita heaven, who will follow on from Sakyamuni Buddha, derives from this source.\\" (Keown, Dictionary of Buddhism) Notes Gandhara river god statuette.

It was at one time the largest grand lodge in the world in terms of membership. The Grand Lodge is over 230 years old, having been founded December 15, 1782.

The Grand Lodge of New York has jurisdiction over approximately 60,000 Freemasons, organized in more than 800 Lodges, most of them located within New York State.2007 Empire Mason Magazine  History  =Colonial and federalist eras: 1730‚Äì1820= It is not known when the first Freemason set foot in the American colony of New York, but the first documented presence dates from the mid-1730s, when Daniel Coxe, Jr. (1673‚Äì1739), was appointed by the Duke of Norfolk, the Grand Master of the Premier Grand Lodge of England (known to historians as the \\"Moderns\\"), to act as a Provincial Grand Master for the provinces of New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. As no authenticated records exist of his tenure as Provincial Grand Master, it seems doubtful that he exercised any authority in Masonic endeavors as he died a few years after his appointment. From 1738 to the 1780s, additional Warrants were issued by GLE (Moderns) to Francis Goelet (1738‚Äì1753), to George Harrison (1753‚Äì1771) and to Sir John Johnson (1771‚Äì?). As Johnson was a supporter of the British during the American Revolution, he is believed to have taken his warrant with him when he fled to Canada, thus leaving the Moderns Lodges without a Provincial Grand Master.Bicentennial Commemorative Volume of Holland Lodge No. 8, published by the Lodge, New York, 1988. pp 9-12 To further complicate matters, by the 1750s, the Antient Grand Lodge of England (known to historians as the \\"Ancients\\"), a rival Masonic Grand Lodge, had also created a Provincial Grand Lodge of New York, which subsequently chartered lodges under its own jurisdiction. Additional lodges were chartered in New York by the Grand Lodge of Scotland and the Grand Lodge of Ireland. The Ancients retained their charter throughout the Revolution, however, and it was based upon this charter that an independent Grand Lodge of New York was created in 1781, with Robert R. Livingston as Grand Master. The Grand Lodge of New York was officially organized on December 15, 1782, under the Provincial Grand Warrant dated September 5, 1781, from the ‚ÄúAthol‚Äù or Antient Grand Lodge of England. The Grand Lodge declared its independence and assumed its modern title ‚ÄúGrand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of the State of New York‚Äù on June 6, 1787. While the \\"Athol\\" Charter descended from the \\"Ancients\\", Livingston himself was a member of a \\"Modern\\" Lodge. Thus the two rival Grand Lodge traditions, which in England did not unite until 1813, had already merged before that in New York State. =St. John's Lodge No. 1, A.Y.M.= St. John's Lodge, chartered in 1757, is the oldest operating Lodge under the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of New York. St. John's Lodge is the custodian of what is now known as the George Washington Inaugural Bible.

Among the organizations that are rooted in its charitable endeavors are, the Masonic Medical Research Institute, Acacia Village and Masonic Home in Utica; the Chancellor Robert R. Livingston Library and Museum in New York and Utica; the Masonic Youth Camp at Camp Turk in Woodgate; the DeWint House at Tappan and its many charitable activities of its annual Brotherhood Fund Drive. The Grand Lodge sponsors Child Identification Programs, Drug and Alcohol Awareness programs in schools, and gives thousands of dollars a day to worthy charities around the State. Religious and Racial Equality In May 2012, at its Grand Lodge Session, Grand Lodge of New York had approved the findings of a Special Committee which has determined that certain Grand Lodges, notably those following the Swedish Rite, restrict their membership to members of the Christian faith. As a consequence of this, the members of the Grand Lodge of New York voted unanimously that non-Christian Masons living in these Grand Jurisdictions will not come under the exclusivity enjoyed by said Grand Lodges. A notice was sent out to all Grand Lodges with which the Grand Lodge of New York is in amity, that the Grand Lodge of New York will recognize as Regular any Lodges opened up in these territories by any other regular Grand Lodge. Furthermore, the committee's tenure was continued for an additional two years in order to determine if further measures need to be taken.  Organization of Triangles Inc.  The Organization of Triangles Inc. is a Masonic youth movement for young women aged between 10 and 21 years old. The Organization of Triangles Inc. was founded in 1925 by Rose E.

Coon entered the five-story school building shortly before 1:00 p.m. EST, armed with two handguns (a .22-caliber revolver and a .38-caliber revolver), and a box of additional rounds of ammunition for each pistol; three folding knives were also in Coon's possession, which were all stocked together in a duffel bag. Wearing a Marilyn Manson concert shirt, black jeans, and black-painted fingernails,\\"5 Hospitalized After 14-Year-Old Goes on Shooting Rampage at Cleveland High School\\" Coon walked to the fourth floor of the building and entered the men's washroom where he loaded two revolvers. The shooting began at approximately 1:06 p.m. on the fourth floor of the building, after 14-year- old Michael Peek punched Coon in the face for bumping into him. When Peek walked away, Coon shot him in the abdomen. Another student, 17-year-old Darnell Rodgers, suffered a graze gunshot wound to the elbow in the same hallway. Michael Grassie, a social studies teacher, was shot in the chest when Coon entered his classroom. A second teacher, David Kachadourian, was shot in the back of his shoulder while in the hallway evacuating his students. During the entire shooting, Coon was said to be cursing. The shooting ended when Coon entered another room and fatally shot himself in the right side of his head. The school was placed on Code Blue lockdown shortly after the shooting.  Victims  Four individuals were wounded in the shooting; two students and two teachers. The two injured teachers were treated at MetroHealth Medical Center, and the two students injured were treated at the Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital. A 14-year-old student was also hospitalized for knee and back injuries received from being trampled in a hallway by fleeing students. One student and teacher were discharged later that day; the other students were released the following day. The last victim was discharged from the hospital on October 15. Perpetrator Fourteen-year-old Asa H. Coon had been placed on a three-day suspension two days prior to the shooting for an altercation with another student regarding the existence of God. According to Coon's uncle, Larry Looney, Coon said he was upset because the teachers would not listen to what he had to say regarding the fight. According to fellow students and teachers, Coon had apparently been the target of bullying by students at the school for his Gothic-appearance and eccentric behavior, and had made threats of violence in front of students and teachers the week before the shooting. Joseph Fletcher, a friend of Coon, said he had been \\"pushed too far\\" and that teachers were unable to help with his problems. Michael Grassie, who was one of Coon's teachers, said that Coon was frustrated because he was given a failing grade in his World History class, and had made attempts to goad him into a fight. Juvenile Court records show that Coon had a criminal history and mental health problems since 2005, and threatened to commit suicide while in a mental health facility in summer 2006. Aftermath At 2:50 p.m., an hour- and-a-half after the shooting, Cleveland Mayor Frank G. Jackson announced in a news conference that five people, including three students, were hurt in a shooting at the SuccessTech Academy. Four of them having been shot; the students being in \\"stable\\" condition and the adults being in a more \\"elevated\\" state. Classes throughout the Cleveland Metropolitan School District were canceled the following two days and resumed on Monday, October 15, and classes at SuccessTech Academy did not resume until Tuesday, October 16. Cleveland's public school system established an anonymous hotline for students to report threats and dangerous behavior. The school system also announced plans to install metal detectors in all its schools and hire additional armed security guards to patrol the campuses. Schools were instructed to implement additional security precautions, to be reviewed by a professional security firm. A crime scene photo taken of Coon after his suicide was posted by Cleveland disc jockey Shane French (Rover) on a webpage promoting Rover's Morning Glory and soon taken down. Mayor Jackson called the photo, which he didn't see, \\"extremely inappropriate\\".\\"Internet posting of Asa Coon death photo tracked\\", by Amanda Garret, The Plain Dealer Cleveland police officer Walter Emerick, who took the picture using his cell phone camera, was suspended from duty for eight days for sending the photo to other people, who eventually leaked it to the Internet.

It was the first feature film released in Serbia and the Balkans. Petroviƒá portrays the eponymous rebel leader Karaƒëorƒëe, who led the First Serbian Uprising of 1804‚Äì1813. Karaƒëorƒëe was first conceived by the aspiring film producer Svetozar Botoriƒá, the owner of Serbia's first cinema. Following an unsuccessful attempt to secure government funding for the project, Botoriƒá decided to personally finance the film. Actors from the National Theatre were cast in the leading roles. Botoriƒá had worked with a cinematographer, Louis de Be√©ry, in the past for filming newsreels, and used him again. Principal photography ran through July and August 1911, and took place in and around Belgrade. The film was well received following its Belgrade premiere in October 1911. Although it was financially successful at home, Path√© opted not to distribute it abroad. The decision steered Botoriƒá into precarious financial straits, as the film's domestic box office revenues were barely enough to cover the cost of production. After several further unsuccessful attempts at getting international distribution for his films, Botoriƒá left the film industry altogether. In 1928, Karaƒëorƒëe was last screened to a group of Serbian √©migr√©s living in the United States. The last known copy went missing in 1947 or 1948, and for many decades thereafter, the film was considered lost. In July 2003, a largely intact copy was discovered in Vienna by researchers from the Yugoslav Film Archive. The film stock was subsequently repatriated to Serbia, where it was restored in time to be screened on the 200th anniversary of the outbreak of the First Serbian Uprising, in February 2004. The film underwent digital restoration in 2011; the digitally restored version of Karaƒëorƒëe was subsequently screened on the 100th anniversary of its release. In December 2016, the Yugoslav Film Archive declared the film to be a piece of \\"cultural heritage of exceptional importance\\". Plot The film opens with an adolescent Karaƒëorƒëe (Milorad Petroviƒá) killing an Ottoman official (Ilija Stanojeviƒá). The murder turns Karaƒëorƒëe into a fugitive. Following an unsuccessful rebellion against the Ottomans, Karaƒëorƒëe is forced to flee Serbia and seek refuge in the Austrian Empire, across the Sava River. When Karaƒëorƒëe's father refuses to accompany his son out of the country, Karaƒëorƒëe kills him. After spending a period of time in Austria, Karaƒëorƒëe returns to Serbia. In February 1804, following the Slaughter of the Knezes, surviving Serbian notables gather at the Ora≈°ac Assembly and decide to rebel against the Dahije, the renegade Janissaries who precipitated the massacre. The notables propose that Karaƒëorƒëe lead the insurrection, given his prior military experience. He initially declines their offer, but ultimately relents; the First Serbian Uprising begins. The Dahije soon foresee their downfall, witnessing their fates reflected in a bowl of water drawn from the Danube. Karaƒëorƒëe defeats the Dahije, but ends up turning on the Sultan, who had earlier offered to support Karaƒëorƒëe in his struggle against the rogue Janissaries. Karaƒëorƒëe scores a string of victories against the Porte, routing the Ottomans at the Battle of Mi≈°ar, and eventually seizing Belgrade. The uprising continues for nearly a decade but is ultimately defeated and Karaƒëorƒëe is forced to flee to Austria once again. In 1817, he decides to return to Serbia to lead a new rebellion. Karaƒëorƒëe's chief rival, Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá, is made aware of this development. He arranges a meeting with Vujica Vuliƒáeviƒá, an erstwhile friend of Karaƒëorƒëe now on Obrenoviƒá's payroll, and orders that Karaƒëorƒëe be killed. When Karaƒëorƒëe returns to Serbia, Vuliƒáeviƒá offers him a tent in a forest, and while he is sleeping, shoots and kills him with a rifle. The film ends with a passage from The Mountain Wreath, an epic poem written by Njego≈°, the national poet of Serbia and Montenegro. The actors then perform a curtain call.

Up until that point, films could only be viewed in traveling theatres which periodically visited Serbia's large cities. Very few members of the country's intelligentsia considered cinema to have any cultural value and fewer still deemed it financially rewarding. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Botoriƒá was convinced that film could be turned into a profitable endeavour. In 1909, he signed a contract with the French cinematographic firm Path√©, becoming their representative in Serbia and Bulgaria. In this capacity, he held exclusive Balkan premieres of Path√©'s films in his hotel. Botoriƒá also regularly produced newsreels about local events on Path√©'s behalf, with the firm providing filming equipment and a cameraman (Louis de Be√©ry), and Botoriƒá giving them a share of his admission profits. In 1911, Botoriƒá teamed up with the prominent stage actor Ilija Stanojeviƒá to establish the Union for the Production of Serbian Films (). Botoriƒá was inspired to produce feature films after seeing Charles Le Bargy and Andr√© Calmettes's The Assassination of the Duke of Guise (), an early example of narrative cinema. Up until that point, all films made in Serbia were documentary and ethnological films, covering events of historical significance such as official functions and state ceremonies to events of a more banal nature, such as common people on Belgrade's streets going about their daily lives. Immediately, Botoriƒá came upon the idea of producing a film about the 19th-century revolutionary Karaƒëorƒëe. The Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá dynasty, with King Peter at its head, had returned to power in 1903 through a coup d'√©tat, usurping the rival Obrenoviƒá dynasty. Owing to the violent nature of the coup, the Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá dynasty faced several years of international isolation. Improving the royal family's public image abroad was thus made a priority. Botoriƒá, who hoped to secure government funding for his future cinematic endeavors, thus felt that a feature film about Karaƒëorƒëe would improve cinema's reputation domestically and increase its profile in the eyes of Serbia's leaders. Karaƒëorƒëe was based on a number of sources, namely an eponymous stage play by the playwright Milo≈° Cvetiƒá, various biographies and hagiographies about the rebel leader, as well as the epic poem The Start of the Revolt Against the Dahijas (), which is traditionally attributed to the bard Filip Vi≈°njiƒá. The film's screenplay was written by Stanojeviƒá, ƒÜira Manok, and an individual credited only by their surname, \\"Savkoviƒá\\". =Casting and cinematography= In order to lend the project greater credibility, Botoriƒá enlisted actors from the National Theatre for the film. Milorad Petroviƒá, a veteran stage actor, was given the role of Karaƒëorƒëe. The child actor who played the adolescent Karaƒëorƒëe was coincidentally also named Milorad Petroviƒá. Jevrem Bo≈æoviƒá played five different characters, including Karaƒëorƒëe's father and Karaƒëorƒëe's rival Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá. Sava Todoroviƒá was cast as Mehmed-aga Foƒçiƒá, one of the leaders of the Dahije. Stanojeviƒá played Vuliƒáeviƒá, as well as a sipahi and a sycophantic follower. Matija Nenadoviƒá was played by Aleksandar Milojeviƒá. The part of Hajduk Veljko was played by Dragoljub Sotiroviƒá, who also played the part of Karaƒëorƒëe's brother Marinko. Dobrica Milutinoviƒá appeared on screen as the rebel leader Janko Katiƒá. Vukosava Jurkoviƒá played the role of Karaƒëorƒëe's mother, Marica. Karaƒëorƒëe was directed by Stanojeviƒá. The film had a total budget of 20,000 dinars. Botoriƒá had attempted to persuade the Royal Serbian Government to finance the film, but without success. Karaƒëorƒëe was filmed in Belgrade and its environs. Principal photography lasted from mid-July to mid-August 1911. De Be√©ry, whom Botoriƒá had employed to film newsreels in the past, was the film's cinematographer. Outdoor scenes, such as the ones depicting the Ora≈°ac Assembly and the Battle of Mi≈°ar, were shot on the banks of the Danube and the Sava, mostly at Ada Ciganlija, as well as at the Belgrade Fortress, Topƒçider park, and the Banjica forest. More than 1,000 extras were used. Indoor scenes were filmed at the Hotel Paris, with props and set pieces provided by the National Theatre. Once filming was complete, the negatives were sent to Paris to be developed by Path√©. Release =Contemporary reception= Contemporary newspaper advertisement Karaƒëorƒëe premiered at the Hotel Paris on . The same day, the film was screened before King Peter at what is now referred to as the Old Palace. Although officially titled The Life and Deeds of the Immortal Leader Karaƒëorƒëe (), the film was simply distributed as Karaƒëorƒëe. It was the first feature film to be released in Serbia, as well as in the Balkans more broadly. Karaƒëorƒëe was a financial success domestically. A review published in the Belgrade daily Veƒçernje novosti, dated , states: \\"The picture was well choreographed, with clean camerawork. ... [I]t will cause a real sensation wherever it is shown.\\" Although successful domestically, Path√© refused to distribute the film abroad and reached a similar business decision with regard to its sister film, Ulrich of Cilli and Ladislaus Hunyadi (). Instead, Path√© opted for an ethnographic short whose subject was a Romani wedding at Ada Ciganlija, which became the first Serbian film to be screened abroad. Because Path√© had decided against distributing Karaƒëorƒëe internationally, Botoriƒá relied on the film's domestic box office revenue to recoup expenses, which it was barely able to cover. Having invested significant amounts of time and money in feature films and receiving little in return, Botoriƒá decided that they were not worth the effort. Commercial film production came to a virtual halt following the outbreak of World War I. During the Austro-Hungarian, German and Bulgarian invasion of Serbia in late 1915, Botoriƒá was taken prisoner. He died in an Austro-Hungarian internment camp the following year. Stanojeviƒá was also apparently dissuaded from partaking in feature films and remained committed to theatrical performances for the remainder of his life. De Be√©ry resumed filming newsreels. =Rediscovery= A still from the film depicting Karaƒëorƒëe (centre) standing among his followers The film was last screened before a group of Serbian √©migr√©s in the United States in 1928. A copy of it existed in Belgrade until 1947 or 1948, when its owner tossed it into the Danube to avoid being persecuted by Yugoslavia's new communist government. Film historians and archivists began searching for a surviving print of Karaƒëorƒëe as early as 1963. In response to inquiries from the Yugoslav Film Archive, Path√© announced that it did not possess a film titled Karaƒëorƒëe in its archives. It also stated that it had no record of a cinematographer named Louis de Be√©ry ever being on its payroll. In 1969, on behalf of the Yugoslav Film Archive, the film historian Dejan Kosanoviƒá examined the collection of the Cin√©math√®que Fran√ßaise in Paris, to no avail. In 1992, the premises of the Royal Compound in Belgrade's prestigious Dedinje neighbourhood were searched after a tip from Prince Tomislav, who stated that his father, King Alexander, once had a copy of the film in his possession and viewed it regularly. The search did not yield any results. In the early 2000s, scholars from the Yugoslav Film Archive resumed their attempts to find a surviving print of the film. The effort was spearheaded by Aleksandar Erdeljanoviƒá and Radoslav Zelenoviƒá of the Yugoslav Film Archive. In the course of his research, Erdeljanoviƒá discovered that de Be√©ry was a Hungarian cinematographer, not a French one, whose real name was Lajos Zoltan √Årp√°d Pitrolf, thus resolving the mystery of why Path√© did not have him listed on their payroll. On 16 July 2003, a largely intact print was discovered at the Austrian Film Archive in Vienna. It was found among the effects of Ignaz Reinthaler, who had owned a cinema in Osijek before and during World War I, but relocated to Austria following Austria-Hungary's dissolution. Karaƒëorƒëe was subsequently repatriated to Serbia and placed in the possession of the Yugoslav Film Archive, a storied institute with one of the largest film stocks in the world, but plagued by years of systematic neglect and a persistent lack of funds. The recovered print was mostly in good condition, with the exception of some sections damaged from exposure to the elements. Since the original running time of the film is unknown, it is unclear how much of it was recovered and how much remains missing. The rediscovered footage was first screened to the public at the National Theatre on 14 February 2004, coinciding with the 200th anniversary of the start of the First Serbian Uprising. The film was screened alongside an accompanying score created by the composer Vladimir Pejkoviƒá. Since the recovered print was missing intertitles, new ones were added by the Yugoslav Film Archive, based on the film's epic and literary source material. Later in 2004, the film was released on DVD by the Yugoslav Film Archive with separate Serbian- and English-language menus, as well as English subtitles. The DVD release also features a twenty-minute documentary chronicling the film's rediscovery. Critical analysis Karaƒëorƒëe was one of many historical films produced in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century; it was thus a product of its time. Subjects such as the struggle against the Ottoman Empire would continue to dominate Serbian cinema for decades to come. The film historian Michael Stoil describes Karaƒëorƒëe as a propaganda film designed to shore up support for the ruling Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá dynasty. \\"[K]araƒëorƒëe and similar works were conceived as historical pageants rather than historical drama,\\" Stoil writes. \\"They were celebrations of well-known leaders, events, and mass virtues, constituting appeals to enroll the Balkan masses in support of nationalism and the ruling dynasties, a recurrent theme among urban intelligentsia on the eve of the Balkan Wars and afterwards.\\" The film scholar Vlastimir Sudar criticizes Stoil's take, because at the time it was written, Karaƒëorƒëe had not been seen in decades. \\"From today's perspective, it is a static film d'art, a historical spectacle with tableaux vivants, mise-en-sc√®ne, and baroque, emotionally emphatic intertitles,\\" the film scholar Nevena Dakoviƒá writes. \\"Anticipating the wave of Serbian historical spectacles in the 1930s, the film fuels national sentiments and consciousness, celebrates national identity, and broadly participates in what Eric Hobsbawm has called \\"invention of the tradition\\" by glorifying and mythologizing a past that determines the shape of things to come.\\" Erdeljanoviƒá categorizes the extant portions of the film into 16 distinct episodes, eleven of which were shot outdoors and five of which were shot indoors. With the exception of the Battle of Mi≈°ar, the film's remaining scenes featured static camerawork, simple framing and no cuts. \\"Many scenes, particularly interiors, look \\"stagey\\" in the style familiar from much early cinema,\\" the film scholar Roger Smither writes. \\"On the whole, action is filmed in medium shot, with next to no camera movement and no close-ups. Emotion is represented by grand gestures and frequent tableaux.\\" Nonetheless, the academics Mira and Anton√≠n J. Liehm believe that Karaƒëorƒëe represented a \\"crossing of boundaries between stage and screen\\". As Sudar notes, earlier European films such as The Assassination of the Duke of Guise represented little more than filmed theatre performances. Smither praises the staging of the Battle of Mi≈°ar, in particular. \\"Such moments show real panache,\\" he writes, \\"and give the film considerable interest in its own right, as well as the automatic value it has on account of its remarkable history.\\" Legacy Although the film was popular with the Serbian public, it failed to pique the interest of the country's leadership, and the Royal Serbian Government offered virtually no financial support to Serbia's nascent film industry in subsequent years. Sudar writes that Botoriƒá's attempts to transform the public's perception of cinema from \\"mindless entertainment\\" to a legitimate art form, though primarily motivated by the prospect of financial reward, \\"may now be perceived as noble\\". Prior to its rediscovery, Karaƒëorƒëe ‚Äì and early Serbian cinema more broadly ‚Äì had generally been overlooked by academics and scholars, who were of the belief that such motion pictures were of little historical or cinematic value. \\"Once the film had been restored and screened,\\" Sudar writes, \\"it was evident that it was advanced for its time.\\" In 2011, Karaƒëorƒëe underwent digital restoration to mark the 100th anniversary of its release. Digitally restoring the film was an arduous and painstaking affair. \\"To restore 10 to 15 minutes of film can take two to three months,\\" Erdeljanoviƒá said. The restoration process ultimately took more than a year. It was overseen by Erdeljanoviƒá, in his capacity as the head of the Yugoslav Film Archive. The film specialists Dubravko and Marija Badaliƒá, Lazar Lisinac, Bojan Perkoviƒá and Stevan Staniƒá also contributed their expertise. The digitally restored version of the film was ultimately released on DVD. The same year, Serbia's national postal service, Po≈°ta Srbije, released a postage stamp commemorating the film's release. In 2012, Karaƒëorƒëe was nominated for UNESCO's Memory of the World Register by the Yugoslav Film Archive. As of 2019, the Miroslav Gospel, Nikola Tesla's archive and Austria-Hungary's declaration of war against Serbia are the only items from Serbia listed by the register. In December 2016, the Yugoslav Film Archive declared Karaƒëorƒëe to be a piece of \\"cultural heritage of exceptional importance\\", leaving the decision to be ratified by the Ministry of Culture and Information and the National Assembly of Serbia.

Life and career  Woodfield was born in Dulwich, south-east London, and attended Alleyn's School, Dulwich. He was commissioned in the Royal Artillery in 1942, rising to become a captain before leaving the Army in 1947. He read English at King's College London. He then joined the Home Office in 1950 and became Assistant Private Secretary to the Secretary of State, Viscount Kilmuir. In 1955, he was seconded for two years to the Federal Government of Nigeria, to assist in the preparations for that country's independence. In 1961 he became Private Secretary dealing with parliamentary and home affairs, in which function he served three prime ministers: Harold Macmillan, Alec Douglas-Home and Harold Wilson. He returned to the Home Office in 1965 as an Assistant Secretary, and he was appointed secretary to Commonwealth Immigration Commission, which was headed by Admiral-of-the-Fleet Lord Mountbatten. When Mountbatten later undertook an inquiry into prison security, following a number of highly publicized escapes from jail, he asked that Woodfield be assigned to it as its secretary. Woodfield was then promoted to be Under-Secretary in the Prison Department of the Home Office, charged with the responsibility of implementing the recommendations of the commission that had been accepted by the Secretary of State, Roy Jenkins. Woodfield participated in what is now believed to have been the first meeting between the Irish Republican Army and senior officials of the British Government. The meeting place on 20 June 1972 in extreme secrecy at an IRA safe house owned by Colonel Sir Michael McCorkell at Ballyarnett, near Derry's border with County Donegal. The IRA was represented at that meeting by D√°ith√≠ √ì Conaill, a senior republican strategist, and Gerry Adams, and the British government was represented by Frank Steele, believed to be an MI6 agent, and Woodfield. Six days later, on 26 June 1972, the IRA implemented a \\"bilateral\\" ceasefire, and an IRA delegation attended a secret meeting with the British Government at a Minister‚Äôs home in Cheyne Walk in Chelsea. Woodfield and Steele also represented the British Government at that meeting, along with William Whitelaw, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, and Paul Channon, a millionaire Guinness heir and minister of state at the Northern Ireland Office; the IRA was again represented by Adams and √ì Conaill, along with Se√°n MacStiof√°in, the leader of the delegation, S√©amus Twomey, Martin McGuinness, Ivor Bell, and Myles Shevlin, a solicitor. Woodfield was promoted to Deputy Secretary in charge of the Northern Ireland Department of the Home Office in 1972 and was promoted to Permanent Under-Secretary of State in 1981. Woodfield retired from the Home Office 1983 and was knighted the same year. He continued to work on a variety of special assignments. From 1984 to 1991 he chaired the London and Metropolitan Staff Commission, which dealt with the problems for staff created by the winding-up of the metropolitan counties. He served for eight years from 1987 as the first Staff Commissioner for the Security and Intelligence Services (including the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS or MI6) and the Security Service (MI5)), set up after the Michael Bettaney case to provide an external \\"ombudsman\\" to whom members and former members of those services could turn for counsel if they had grievances or concerns.

History  It was founded in 1986 by former airline pilot Chris Mays and some neighbors and dropped in March 2001. (A 2001 Wall Street Journal article describes the rise and fall and disappearance of its founder, Chris Mays.) Originally begun as a way to lease handmade, one-of-a-kind, Japanese-produced robot dinosaurs to North American shopping malls, in time Dinamation defied its original mandate and came to produce its own production-line models for exhibit in science museums and zoos worldwide. Dinamation was an example of an American company following, improving upon, and then outpacing its Japanese rivals. Dinamation started out with a dozen movie special effects technicians, sculptors, painters, and engineers housed in third-tier industrial spaces in Santa Ana, California, where municipal, safety and corporate oversight was minimal and creative freedom maximal. Given vague guidelines and a selection of consumer-grade dinosaur books for reference, they produced one \\"beta\\" show (which was sold, not leased) for a museum in Boston and also sold a display to the Mesa Southwest Museum in Phoenix, AZ, US (D.I.C. creatures are still on active exhibit there). Techniques improved (and so did scientific fidelity, up to a point, under the guidance of paleontologists Dr.s Robert Bakker and George Callison and given the contributions made by many skilled engineers, inventor/sculptors such as public artists Raymond Persinger and Marianne O'Barr, movie effects artists Steve Koch (also designed paint schemes), Brian Sipe and Matt Croteau. By 1988, Dinamation had grown to 150 employees embedded in a complex corporate structure and operating out of a facility in Tustin, California. Museum attendances soared with every visit by the \\"Dinosaurs Alive!\\" shows and remained fairly high afterwards, boosting the revenues (and often the survival) of almost every venue. Dinamation was for a time quite successful, with exhibits around the world in important museums including the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, the National Geographic Museum, and the British Museum of Natural History. At the end, under a cloud of financial mystery, over 700 American-made 'creatures' were left in limbo, scattered in science museums, trucks, and shipping containers across the United States and abroad. Some of the orphaned robots have become permanent parts of the displays in the museums that had shows running when the company folded. Other dinos were sold, lost, disassembled, disposed of, or recycled as spare parts for other dinos in better shape. Other final vestiges of Dinamation can be seen as ubiquitous uncredited photographs of the dinosaur robots and preproduction art, scattered in children's books, toy art, video backgrounds, and recycled magazine illustrations, as well as appearances in cinema, for example, Woody Allen's film, Alice. Images of the sculptures in process and in completed sculptures in museum displays are available online.http://www.DinosaurSculpture.com However, by far the largest collection of Dinamation creatures ended up as the possessions of Wonder Works USA, in Abilene, TX. WonderWorks is now owned by Jack Hull, who has been leasing out this collection since 2001 (with the, now former, partner of Hull, John Thomas). This huge collection has been kept in service by WonderWorks with the reliance upon two former Dinamation technicians, Ken Diggs and Mike Short, that formed Creature Craft in Nebraska.  Sculptures  Some examples of Dinamation's sculptures can still be seen at the Otway Fly in Victoria, Australia. They can also be viewed at the Museum of Western Colorado's Dinosaur Journey Museum in Fruita, Colorado. These include a Dilophosaurus, Triceratops, Stegosaurus, Utahraptor, and Apatosaurus robots, along with Tyrannosaurus sculptures.

Nwako served as the first foreign minister from 1966-1969. He was Speaker of the National Assembly of Botswana from 1989 to 1999.Former Speakers of Parliament, Official website of the Parliament of Botswana Mout was one of the political architects of modern Botswana during his long and distinguished career of public service, Nwako occupied a number of cabinet portfolios before retiring as Speaker of the National Assembly in 1999. he was also a key founding member of the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP). Nwako spent most of his boyhood helping to mind the family cattle. At the age of fourteen he was sent for Primary Education at Khama Memorial School. Thereafter, in 1943, he went to Tiger Kloof Institute (old Moeding) near Vryburg, where he completed his secondary education. Nwako's classmates at Tiger Kloof such late associates as Motsamai Mpho, Edison Masisi, Washington Meswele and Quett Masire. With Masire in particular, he developed friendly rivalry as the two competed for top academic honours in the class. Nwako was especially keen on Mathematics, a talent that earned him a nickname \\"Pythagoras\\". After completing his studies, he worked in the tribal treasuries at Molepolole and Serowe, before becoming a bursar at Moeng College. Throughout the 1950s, Nwako was among a group of young educated Gammangwato based progressives who called for political reform as well as the return of Seretse Khama from involuntary British exile. Like Nwako, many members of this group, such as Monametsi Chiepe, Lenyeletse Seretse, and Gaolese and Kenneth Koma, belonged to the Malekantwa age-regiment (mophato). In 1952-53, the Malekantwa activists, along with such older figures as Kgalemang Motsete and Leetile Raditladi, came together to form a political movement initially known as the Bamangwato National Congress. The Congress stood as a new third force in Gammangwato politics between the rival camps of older traditionalists led by Tshekedi Khama and Keaboka Kgamane (pro-Seretse). During the period, Nwako also began writing for newspapers, especially Naledi ya Batswana and African Echo, using the pseudonym ‚ÄúTribesman‚Äù. Through his private as well as public correspondence, Nwako kept in touch with fellow activists of his generation located elsewhere in the Protectorate. In 1960, Nwako stood and was elected to the Executive of the Bangwato Tribal Council. In 1961, he was further elected to the new territory-wide African Council, establishing himself as one of the up-and-coming northern Protectorate politicians. Late in 1960, Nwako‚Äôs former classmate, Mpho, approached him about forming a new nationalist movement, which would become known as the People‚Äôs Party (BPP). By then the Congress and subsequent Federal Party led by Raditladi had failed to attract mass support. In January 1961, Nwako did join a BPP delegation that met the British Resident Commissioner, Peter Fawcus, to protest inequities in the electoral structures of the Legislative Council (Legco). Ultimately, Nwako was not attracted to the BPP. Instead, by August 1961, he was part of a core group gathered by Seretse Khama to discuss the formation of an alternative movement. Thereafter, one of Nwako‚Äôs early tasks was to help bring prominent people from outside of Gammangwato into the organisation. Nwako helped write the Party‚Äôs constitution, which was approved at a January 1961 meeting in Mahalapye. Thereafter, he served on its five men Executive as Assistant Treasurer. In July‚ÄìAugust 1963, Nwako joined Khama and Masire in representing the BDP at the Constitutional Review Conference convened by Fawcus at Lobatse. In the run up to the first national elections, which were held in March 1965, Nwako spent much of his time campaigning for the BDP. In this, he often used a bicycle to move around Gammangwato villages. When the votes were counted, Nwako won a landslide victory in the Tswapong North constituency, whose support he retained for another three decades. After the 1965 election, Nwako served in Botswana‚Äôs first Cabinet as Minister of Agriculture. Thereafter, he occupied a number of portfolios including Foreign Affairs, before settling in as Minister of Commerce and Industry from 1977 to 1989. In October 1966, as Minister of State, he presented Botswana‚Äôs case for admission to the United Nations. In 1989 Nwako retired from Cabinet to assume the role of Speaker of the National Assembly. In 1994, he was succeeded as Tshwapong North MP by the then Vice President Festus Mogae, but continued to serve as Speaker until his retirement in 1999.

A retainer of the Toyotomi clan, Shigenari fought at the Siege of Osaka (leading Toyotomi forces at the Battle of Imafuku) and died in battle. Kimura Shigenari was a son of Kimura Shigekore, also known as Kimura Hitachi no suke (vice-governor of Hitachi), one of the chief counselors of Toyotomi Hidetsugu, but much of his origin remains uncertain. His mother was Toyotomi Hideyori's wetnurse: that was why Shigenari was able to become Hideyori's page at an early age and his vassal later. At the Winter Siege of Osaka (1614), his first campaign, Shigenari commanded an army as a general and fought well. In recognition of his distinguished deed in that battle Hideyori bestowed on him a testimonial that acclaimed him as the ‚Äúpeerless hero of the nation‚Äù, together with a short sword made by Masamune, the famous swordsmith. However, he returned those rewards immediately, because of his loyalty and absolute trust in the Toyotomi family. A year later, during the Summer Siege of Osaka, he left the castle walls, leading the main force of the Toyotomi army and fought against Ii Tadataka's troops. In that battle, Shigenari wore a suit of armor called kozane made of gold and silver scales, with a white horo (a mantle meant to disrupt the flight of oncoming arrows), and rode a black horse. He fought an all-out battle, charging with a 6-yard-spear himself, and was caught in the action.

Rock and Roll Hugg, known to his listeners as \\"Huggy Boy\\", was instrumental in the promotion of rock and roll in the 1950s. He is credited with bringing rhythm and blues to the airwaves of Southern California, as well as bringing the \\"Eastside Sound\\" to large audience. He was the first white disc jockey to broadcast (on station KRKD) from the front window of John Dolphin's popular all-night record store, Dolphin's of Hollywood, at the corner of Central and Vernon Avenues. He also co-produced several artists, such as vocalist Jesse Belvin and saxophonist Joe Houston, on Dolphin's various record labels, including Cash and Money. With his own record label, Caddy Records, Hugg recorded local favorites Jim Balcom, Jeanette Baker, Chuck Higgins and Johnny Flamingo. Hugg later promoted bands like The Jaguars, the Village Callers, Thee Midniters and The Champs, later known as the Chicano rock movement. Though originally an R&B; disc jockey, he gradually aimed his radio and television shows at Los Angeles' burgeoning Latino population and featured almost every young Chicano group coming out of East Los Angeles, the San Gabriel Valley, the Pomona Valley, and the San Fernando Valley. He promoted dances and shows in the barrio and was important in the growth of the city's so-called Eastside Sound. He also brought to East Los Angeles groups like Them, Sonny and Cher, The Righteous Brothers and Dusty Springfield, acts that may otherwise have not been accessible to Mexican-American audiences. He was on KRKD, 1951‚Äì55; KWKW, 1954; KALI; KGFJ, 1955; KBLA, 1965;\\"KBLA Hikes Power; Bows New Personnel\\", Billboard. February 27, 1965. pp. 50, 51. Retrieved May 14, 2019.

He hosted an oldies show on KRLA and for a time, a dance program, \\"The Huggie Boy Show\\", which aired weekly on KWHY channel 22. His popularity continued to increase long after the show went off the air. Hugg was one of the Emcee's for the fourteenth famed Cavalcade of Jazz concerts being produced by Leon Hefflin, Sr. held at that year at the Shrine Auditorium on August 3, 1958. The last Cavalcade of Jazz concert was a tribute to the city's most prominent r&b; jocks- Charles Trammel, Hunter Hancock and Jim Randolph teamed up with Hugg. Lionel Hampton, Big Jay McNeely, Dinah Washington, Betty Carter, Billy Eckstine, Jimmy Witherspoon, Louis Jordan, Nat \\"King\\" Cole, Louis Armstrong, Count Basie, Sam Cooke were just a few of the numerous artists that performed over the years.‚ÄúDisc Jockeys Working Mike At Cavalcade‚Äù Article The California Eagle July 10, 1958.‚ÄúTop Deejays to Emcee Cavalcade Of Jazz Aug. 3‚Äù Los Angeles Sentinel July 10, 1958. Following the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which profoundly deregulated how many radio and television stations one corporation can own, CBS ended up buying KRLA in 1998. CBS also owned K-Earth 101, which was also an oldies station. Likely in the name of avoiding any potential competition, even though KRLA was very much an \\"Eastside Sound\\" oldies station as opposed to K-Earth, which was a general oldies station, CBS ended the oldies format on KRLA turning 1110 AM into a talk station. While some people were out of a job, as is the nature of broadcasting, Huggy Boy was, to the genuine surprise to many in the industry, given a nightly spot on 101.1 FM, which is a very coveted position in L.A. radio. While it was a very generous gesture on CBS' and KRTH's part, The Huggy Boy Show on K-Earth was not quite the same, to say the least. In 1998, as it is now, K-Earth had a very highly restrictive oldies playlist, and Huggy Boy was only able to play one tune from his unique oldies collection only once an hour. As listeners to the radio station at 101.1 FM know, K-Earth is a very tightly run on-air operation, which for Huggy Boy meant his sometimes fun rambling between the music, or during requests and dedications, was greatly limited. Hugg's influence was noted on Lighter Shade of Brown's record \\"Huggy Boy Show.\\" and The Blasters‚Äô classic \\"Border Radio\\" was inspired by Hugg‚Äôs dedication show on XPRS. Personal life Hugg was married to Emily for 25 years and had three girls: Darlene, Lisa & Tiffany.

Originally starting out as Litstock for a single day in Golden Gate Park in the spring of 1999, it now has a ten-day run in mid- October, as well as year-round programs and workshops. Consisting of readings, discussions, film screenings, and themed events held at hundreds of Bay Area venues, Litquake now features 200 events and around 700 authors, and draws over 21,000 attendees annually. In 2018, 80% of all events were free and open to the public.  History  Jack Boulware and Jane Ganahl are the co-founders and operate the festival as Executive Director and Artistic Director. Originally hatched over beers at the Edinburgh Castle pub in 1999, Litstock debuted as a free one-day reading series in a fog-bound Golden Gate Park. In 2002, the festival was rechristened Litquake and began expanding its programming to include all elements of the Bay Area literary scene. In 2004, the festival inaugurated a closing night literary pub crawl (Lit Crawl) throughout the city‚Äôs Mission District. In the years following, Litquake added more national and international authors, youth programs (Kidquake), programs for the elderly (Elder Project), a podcast (Lit Cast Live), and special localized editions of the Lit Crawl held each year in Austin, Seattle, New York City, Iowa City, Los Angeles, Portland, Chicago, Kells (Ireland), Cheltenham (England), Minneapolis, Boston, and Wellington (New Zealand) with more being added every year.

Readings and performances were rolled out in three sequential phases over the course of the crawl. The following year the crawl closed the festival, a place in the schedule it has maintained ever since. By 2018 the Lit Crawl had expanded to over 100 venues, including bars, cafes, bookstores, theaters, galleries, clothing boutiques, furniture showrooms, parking lots, a laundromat and a bee-keeping store. The New York Times wrote about the crawl in \\"In San Francisco, Literature as Carnival\\" and again in 2013 in an article entitled \\"A Heady Cocktail of Books and Booze\\" about Lit Crawl in New York City's Lower East Side.https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/13/books/a-heady-cocktail-of-books-and- booze.html?_r=0 Other crawls have been added over the years: Lit Crawl NYC debuted in 2008; Lit Crawl Austin in 2011 as a part of Texas Book Festival; Lit Crawl Brooklyn and Lit Crawl Seattle in 2012. Lit Crawl Iowa City and Lit Crawl Los Angeles 2013. Lit Crawl London, Lit Crawl Portland (Portland Book Festival), and Lit Crawl Boston (Boston Book Festival) was added in 2014. Since 2015, Lit Crawl NYC is a project of Litquake and PEN America, a global community of more than 4,400 writers, translators, and literary professionals dedicated to protecting free expression and promoting literary culture.

Completed in 1903, she was initially assigned to the Northern Squadron (), although she was transferred to the reserve fleet before the end of the year. The ship was recommissioned for a few months in mid-1905 and was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet (Escadre de M√©diterran√©e) in mid-1906 and served as a flagship for the next several years. Jeanne d'Arc was assigned to the reserve in mid-1908 and modified to serve as a training ship for naval cadets of the Naval Academy (√âcole Navale). In 1912, she made the first of two lengthy training cruises. A few days after she returned from her cruise, the ship was mobilised for service with the Northern Squadron as tensions rose before World War I began in August 1914. Jeanne d'Arc was tasked to patrol the English Channel in search of contraband and German blockade runners and continued to perform that mission until March 1915 when she was transferred to the Mediterranean. The ship was initially assigned to support French troops in the Dardanelles Campaign and then became flagship of the French ships patrolling the Levantine coast. In early 1916, Jeanne d'Arc began a lengthy refit that lasted until 1917 when she was assigned to the French West Indies. The ship was placed in reserve in 1918 and resumed her previous role as a training ship the next year. Jeanne d'Arc returned to reserve in 1928 and was struck from the Navy List in 1933 before being sold for scrap the following year. Background and description Plan and right elevation of Jeanne d'Arc from Brassey's Naval Annual 1915, showing the armour layout and positions of the guns. (The plan is incorrect regarding the upper superstructure and the position of the second 138 mm (5.5 in) gun on upper deck ‚Äî it should be in the middle of the ship.) Jeanne d'Arc was originally conceived in the early 1890s as a large protected cruiser for overseas service, but the design was recast as an armoured cruiser by the naval architect Emile Bertin, director of the Navy's Technical Section (Section technique) in 1895.Feron, pp. 67‚Äì69 His design is regarded as unsuccessful with too light an armament for her size and failing to achieve her designed speed.Silverstone, p. 79 The ship measured long overall with a beam of and had a maximum draught of . She displaced at normal load and had a metacentric height of . The hull was subdivided by 15 watertight bulkheads that extended from her double bottom to the main armoured deck.Feron, pp. 75‚Äì76 Jeanne d'Arc had a crew of 651.Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 304 The ship had 3 four-cylinder vertical triple-expansion steam engines, each driving a single three-bladed propeller. The outer engines had propellers while the centre propeller had a diameter of . Steam for the engines was provided by 36 Guyot-du Temple boilers and the engines were rated at a total of . Jeanne d'Arc failed to reach her designed speed of during her sea trials on 23 January 1903, only reaching from . She carried up to of coal that gave her a range of at a speed of . In an effort to improve her speed, the propellers and the struts for her propeller shafts were replaced and her bilge keels were shortened, but the ship is not known to have exceeded her trials speed.Feron, pp. 76, 79, 81 Jeanne d'Arcs main armament consisted of two 40-calibre Mod√®le 1893 guns that were mounted in single-gun turrets, one each fore and aft of the superstructure. The guns fired shells at muzzle velocities ranging from .Friedman 2011, p. 218 The ship's secondary armament comprised fourteen 45-calibre Mod√®le 1893 guns in single mounts, protected by gun shields. Four of the guns on each broadside were positioned in hull sponsons and the remaining guns were on the sides of the superstructure.Feron, pp. 73, 76 Their shells were fired at muzzle velocities of .Friedman 2011, p. 224 For close-range anti-torpedo boat defense, she carried sixteen quick-firing 40-calibre Mod√®le 1885 Hotchkiss guns. Four of these were mounted in the fighting top on the military foremast and the others were positioned in the superstructure. Jeanne d'Arc was also armed with a pair of submerged torpedo tubes. The ship carried six Mod√®le 1892 torpedoes that were fitted with a warhead and had a range of at a speed of .Feron, pp. 73, 75‚Äì76 =Protection= Jeanne d'Arc was protected by a waterline armour belt of Harvey armour that was thick amidships and reduced to at the bow and at the stern. It extended from below the waterline to above it and tapered to a thickness of at its lower edge. Above this was a strake of 80-millimetre armour that was amidships and tapered to at its upper edge. Three additional strakes of 40-millimetre armour covered the sides of the bow up to the forecastle deck.Feron, pp. 74‚Äì76 The sloped protective deck met the bottom edge of the waterline armour belt and ranged in thickness from of mild steel on two layers of \\"extra-mild\\" steel. Above it was a thin deck of armour on a deck. The armour protecting the conning tower was 138 millimetres thick. The turret plates were made from Krupp armour thick on two layers of 11-millimetre plating with a roof thick on a 10-millimetre plate. The barbette armour was thick and reduced to below the upper deck. The gun shields of the secondary armament were thick and the sponsons were protected by hinged 40-millimetre plates. Construction and career Jeanne d'Arc in 1901 before her completion Jeanne d'Arc, named after the French warrior saint Joan of Arc,Silverstone, p. 101 and nicknamed La Jeanne, was ordered on 28 December 1895 from the Arsenal de Toulon. While the Arsenal was not known for its speed of construction, the building of Jeanne d'Arc was even more prolonged than that shipyard's norm. Construction was almost at a standstill from September 1896 to June 1898, despite being laid down in October 1896, as the result of a dispute between the constructors and the naval administration and problems with her engines caused her to be launched on 8 June 1899 without her engines installed. The ship was commissioned for sea trials on 1 March 1901 and they revealed that the boiler rooms were very poorly ventilated and that the boilers were very poorly insulated resulting in a temperature of in the boiler rooms. In addition the feed pumps frequently failed because of the temperature of the feed water was too high due to the overheating of the condensers. Rectifying these problems took until March 1902, although another set of trials in April revealed problems with the piston rings in all three engines. She was finally commissioned on 10 March 1903, before her trials were concluded.Feron, pp. 69, 77‚Äì78, 80‚Äì81 On 14 April, Jeanne d'Arc ferried √âmile Loubet, the President of France, to French North Africa before departing for Marseilles on the 29th. Again manned for trials, the ship was assigned to the Northern Squadron, based at Brest, on 1 June and participated in exercises off the coast of Brittany over the next several months. Plagued by boiler problems, she was reduced to reserve on 14 September before being recommissioned on 8 October for trials. Apparently unsuccessful, Jeanne d'Arc was decommissioned for repairs on 15 November. The ship was recommissioned for trials in May 1905, but was placed in reserve on 6 August.Feron, pp. 79‚Äì80 On 26 May 1906 Captain (Capitaine de vaisseau) √âmile Gu√©pratte assumed command of Jeanne d'Arc and she was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet where she became flagship of the Light Squadron (Escadre L√©gere). After port visits in Tangiers, Morocco, and Gibraltar, she rendezvoused with the fleet on 12 July for the annual Grand Manoeuvres that lasted until the 28th. The ship participated in a fleet review by the President of France, Armand Falli√®res, at Marseilles on 16 September to commemorate the laying of the first stone of the Rove canal tunnel connecting Marseilles to the Rh√¥ne River. The following month, Jeanne d'Arc made a port visit to Bizerta, French Tunis. In 1907, the ship visited Morocco, Algeria and Cherbourg before getting her bottom cleaned at Brest in June and returning to Toulon on 20 July. After departing Gibraltar on 12 February 1908, she had a boiler explode, killing five and badly burning three crewmen. After arriving at Brest three days later, the ship was placed in reserve on 15 April to begin modifications to make her suitable for use as a training ship for naval cadets. Jeanne d'Arc was recommissioned on 20 May 1911 and was attached to the Third Division of the Reserve Squadron until 1 May 1912 when she was transferred to the Atlantic Schools Division. The ship began a lengthy cruise of the Atlantic, Mediterranean and Baltic Seas that lasted from 10 October 1912 to 29 July 1913. She visited the Indian Ocean via the Suez Canal on her next cruise from 10 October 1913 to 27 July 1914.Feron, pp. 80‚Äì81 =World War I= Drawing of Jeanne d'Arc Jeanne d'Arc rejoined the Northern Squadron when mobilisation began on 1 August and was assigned to the 1st Division of the Second Light Squadron. After the German declaration of war on 3 August, she was assigned to patrol the western portion of the English Channel in search of blockade runners or ships carrying contraband. The ship remained there until reinforcements were needed in the Eastern Mediterranean after the beginning of the Dardanelles Campaign in February. Jeanne d'Arc was transferred to the Third Squadron in March 1915 where her first mission was to escort a troop convoy to Mudros. In late April, the French made several diversionary landings on the Anatolian side of the Dardanelles while the British made the primary landings on the Gallipoli Peninsula on the European side. The ship supported these landings and was hit twice by 150-millimetre shells on 26 April. One shell damaged a sponson, started a small fire and wounded some of her crew. The other shell failed to detonate and was tossed overboard.Feron, p. 81 Shortly afterwards, she became the flagship of the Third Squadron, hoisting the flags of Vice-Admirals (Vice-Amiral) Louis Dartige du Fournet, Dominique- Marie Gauchet, and Frederic Moreau until 30 March 1916. During this time, Jeanne d'Arc was based in Port Said, Egypt, enforcing the Allied blockade of the Turkish-owned Levantine and Aegean coasts. The ship supported the occupation of the islands of Ruad on 30‚Äì31 August 1915 and Castellorizo on 28 December. She also occasionally bombarded Turkish and German targets, including the German consulates in Alexandretta and Caiffa. Jeanne d'Arc was briefly refitted at Malta in October 1915 before returning to the Levant. The ship was withdrawn from the Levant at the end of March 1916 for a major refit in France. Upon its completion in January 1917, she was transferred to the 4th Light Squadron in the West Indies. Jeanne d'Arc returned to France in 1918 and was placed in reserve with a reduced crew.Feron, pp. 82‚Äì84 =Post-war activities= In 1919 the ship was refitted to allow her to resume her previous role as a training cruiser and was recommissioned in August 1919. Over the next decade, she made nine lengthy cruises, usually departing Brest in September or October and returning around the following July. During the last of these cruises in 1927‚Äì1928, Jeanne d'Arc was commanded by Fran√ßois Darlan. After returning to France that year, the ship was replaced by the newer armoured cruiser and reduced to reserve. She was renamed Jeanne d'Arc II in 1930 to free her name for a purpose-built training cruiser then under construction and was stricken from the list on 15 February 1933. The ship was condemned on 21 March and sold for scrap on 9 July 1934.Feron, p. 84 References Bibliography  Category:Cruisers of the French Navy Category:Ships built in France Category:1899 ships Category:World War I cruisers of France Category:Ships with du Temple boilers Category:Joan of Arc ","title":"French cruiser Jeanne d'Arc (1899)"},{"id":"13666100","text":"Oppurg is a Verwaltungsgemeinschaft (\\"collective municipality\\") in the district Saale-Orla-Kreis, in Thuringia, Germany.

Binion, 132 F. App'x 89 (8th Cir. 2005), is a case in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit applied two recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions, United States v. Booker. and United States v. Fanfan,. in upholding the sentencing decision by the trial court, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. Circumstances Dammeon Binion was arrested for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Representing himself, the defendant filed a pro se motion for a competence-to- stand-trial evaluation in which psychological tests were administered by a psychologist under the supervision of a psychiatrist who integrated the results and reported them to the court. Based on the test results and the discrepancy between these results and the defendant's observed behavior, the psychiatrist concluded that the defendant was most likely feigning mental illness and had no mental disorder. He further stated that the defendant's malingering was a \\"form of recreation rather than a design to accomplish secondary material gain\\". The defendant pleaded guilty to the offense. However, because of his reported malingering, he was also charged with obstruction of justice, which added two points to the sentencing recommendations. The court stated that because of the feigned illness, the defendant was not accepting responsibility for his behavior as is normally required in a plea of guilty, and the normal reduction in sentence for a guilty plea was therefore waived. The defendant was sentenced according to the guidelines recommended by the pre-sentence investigation. Appeal The defendant appealed his sentence on three grounds. First he claimed that by increasing his sentence by adding the charge of obstruction of justice, related to his feigning mental illness, the trial court had violated United States v. Booker (2005). In this case, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the Sixth Amendment required the determination beyond a reasonable doubt of the validity of any fact that increased the sentence of a defendant in a federal criminal case over the highest level of the range as set forth by the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. Second, although acknowledging the feigned mental illness, the defendant stated he did so to amuse himself and without specific intent to obstruct justice, and that therefore the court erred in so charging him and enhancing his sentence accordingly. Third, he argued that because the trial court did not view the defendant as accepting responsibility for his offense even though he pleaded guilty, the court had erred in failing to reduce the defendant's sentence as part of the guilty plea. Ruling The U.S. Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the district court on each of the three grounds raised. Booker was followed in allowing judicial discretion in applying the sentencing guidelines. Thus, the enhancement for obstruction of justice for feigning mental illness on his competency evaluation, adding two points to the sentencing recommendations, was upheld, as was the ruling that because of the feigned illness, the defendant was not accepting responsibility for his behavior for the purposes of a guilty plea, and therefore no reduction in sentence was appropriate. The defendant's sentence, as determined by the trial judge's discretion, was upheld. Significance The case is significant because of the issues it raises if a legal decision is based on the testimony of mental health professionals, by means of forensic psychology. First, it points to a difficult issue in competency evaluations. Although the standards for competency were set forth in Dusky v. United States,. much of the standard remains ambiguous and is not clearly defined. Only one common principle is clear in forensic evaluations, that forensic evaluators cannot reach a finding independent of the facts of the case at hand. Second, many practitioners feel strongly that forensic evaluators should restrict themselves to behavioral observations and describing test results only, and avoid making statements on legal questions as transpired in this case. This case makes it all the more important that the forensic evaluator clarify to the defendant that any information obtained will not be kept confidential, since the defendant has no control over how this information will be used. Third, the issue of malingering is particularly problematic as there is no ultimate test, and such diagnoses boil down to clinical decisions. An extensive review of the literature by Melton et al. did not reveal any studies in which clinicians using various combinations of testing procedures and interviews demonstrated any \\"extraordinary ability\\" to detect malingering.

Although all covered contractors and grantees must maintain a drug-free workplace, the specific components necessary to meet the requirements of the Act vary based on whether the contractor or grantee is an individual or an organization. The requirements for organizations are more extensive, because organizations have to take comprehensive, programmatic steps to achieve a workplace free of drugs.  History  The Drug Free Workplace Act of 1988 didn't come into effect until the late 1980s, when more employers began attempting to eliminate drugs in the workplace. Before the Drug Free Workplace Act, there really was not a federal regulation that employers could use to enforce regulations on employees using drugs. Even though drug testing really didn't come into effect until late 70s early 80s it can still be traced back to about the early 20th century. President Ronald Reagan was the one who passed the Drug Free Workplace Act and made it a law. President Reagan passed the law due to the amount of drug abuse occurring in the military. Drug abuse had become such a huge problem that, \\"He issued Executive Order 12564 banning all federal employees (on and off duty) from using drugs.\\" Soon after this law went into effect, smaller corporations adopted the same rules. The law went into effect November 19, 1988.  Policy  The policy put out by the Department of Labor states it is illegal for employees \\"to manufacture, distribute, dispense or have in possession prohibited controlled substances\\" The enforcement of the law is not limited to one department or jurisdiction. It can included as part of the employment contract. As for enforcement of the law there really is not any one or any department to enforce it. Marijuana is still considered a controlled substance due to it being illegal under federal law.  Penalties  Violation of the Drug Free Workplace Act vary among companies, however, since this law is specific to federal contractors, then the penalties are standard. One can be penalized in the following ways: payment for activities can be revoked, contract can be terminated, and contractor may face prohibition from being involved in any future grants or contracts for a specified period of time. The agency that the contractor is involved with will determine if the law as violated and if the contractor should receive one or more penalties due to this violation.

Larry E. Overman is Distinguished Professor of Chemistry at the University of California, Irvine. He was born in Chicago in 1943. Overman obtained a B.A. degree from Earlham College in 1965, and he completed his Ph.D. in chemistry from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in 1969, under Howard Whitlock Jr. Professor Overman is a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was the recipient of the Arthur C. Cope Award in 2003, and he was awarded the Tetrahedron Prize for Creativity in Organic Chemistry for 2008. Overman's research is focused on the development of new chemical reactions, particularly transition metal catalyzed reactions, and the application of those reactions toward the synthesis of natural products. Overman is most known for the Overman rearrangement, a Claisen rearrangement of allylic alcohols to give allylic trichloroacetamides. Career Overman's Ph.D. focused on the mechanism of rearrangements related to the biosynthesis of lanosterol from squalene oxide via lanosterol synthase. Overman has explained that this work gave him a lifelong love of rearrangement reactions. This was followed by two years as a postdoctoral fellow at Columbia University with Ronald Breslow, using non-covalent binding of cyclodextrin as a model of enzyme binding. Larry Overman began his career at University of California, Irvine in June 1971. The Irvine graduate program was small and thus in his early work Overman frequently performed experiments himself, including his initial discovery of the Overman rearrangement. Palladium emerged as the metal of choice for this reaction, and this led to a long-term interest in palladium catalysis, including the palladium(II)-catalyzed Cope rearrangement, and later work on intramolecular cascading Heck reactions. Overman has performed many total syntheses of natural products, beginning with (¬±)-pumiliotoxin C (with Peter Jessup) in the late seventies. This interest was spurred on by a 1977 sabbatical visit by Samuel J. Danishefsky. Overman has also worked extensively on the aza-Cope-Mannich reaction, originally designed to solve a stereoelectronic problem in the total synthesis of gephyrotoxin. :an Aza-Cope Mannich cascade reaction This reaction is described by Overman as \\"robust\\", and was subsequently used in the total syntheses of several natural products, for example (‚Äì)-strychnine. A ring-enlarging version of the reaction was used in the synthesis of secondary metabolites such as actinophyllic acid. A related reaction, a Prins-Pinacol cascade which produces a tetrahydrofuran, has also been used extensively by the Overman group, for example in the total synthesis of (‚Äì)-magellanine, a Lycopodium alkaloid.

The game is based upon the 1978 concept album, itself based on H.G. Wells' 1898 novel The War of the Worlds. Gameplay required the player to visit a series of sites in and around London, by moving a person using cursor keys or a joystick, and occasionally making choices such as whether to hide, run or stand still. The game was something of a failure, being unpopular with reviewers because it ran very slowly. The player was often killed (hunger and thirst being common causes of death) and forced to begin the adventure from scratch. Original 2-page magazine advertisements stated 'available for ZX Spectrum' but also had a list of other formats the game was 'to be created for' including the Commodore 64, Oric Atmos, BBC Micro and Acorn Electron but no other versions were completed.

These arts are divided into two distinct branches, namely, traditional arts and non-traditional arts. Each branch is further divided into various categories with subcategories. Overview Singkil, an ancient dance from the Darangen chants, a world intangible heritage and a National Cultural Treasure.

There are numerous Filipino specialists or experts on the various fields of traditional arts, with those garnering the highest distinctions declared as Gawad Manlilikha ng Bayan (GAMABA), equal to National Artist. =Folk architecture= Folk architecture in the Philippines differ significantly per ethnic group, where the structures can be made of bamboo, wood, rock, coral, rattan, grass, and other materials. These abodes can range from the hut-style bahay kubo which utilizes vernacular mediums in construction, the highland houses called bale that may have four to eight sides, depending on the ethnic association, the coral houses of Batanes which protects the natives from the harsh sandy winds of the area, the royal house torogan which is engraved with intricately-made okir motif, and the palaces of major kingdoms such as the Daru Jambangan or Palace of Flowers, which was the seat of power and residence of the head of Sulu prior to colonization. Folk architecture also includes religious buildings, generally called as spirit houses, which are shrines for the protective spirits or gods. Most are house- like buildings made of native materials, and are usually open-air.The Tingyans of Northern Philippines and Their Spirit World, Dominic T. Gaioni, Anthropos Bd. 80, H. 4./6. (1985), pp. 381-401 Some were originally pagoda-like, a style later continued by natives converted into Islam, but have now become extremely rare. There are also buildings that have connected indigenous and Hispanic motif, forming the bahay na bato architecture, and its proto-types. Many of these bahay na bato buildings have been declared as world heritage site, as part of Vigan. Folk structures include simple sacred stick stands to indigenous castles or fortresses such as the idjang, to geologically-altering works of art such as the Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras, locally called payyo.Architecture in the Philippines: Filipino building in a cross- cultural context, WW Klassen - 1986 - University of San CarlosHeritage Architecture of Batanes Islands in the Philippines: A Survey of Different House Types and Their Evolution, AJF Ignacio - 2008Perez III, R.D., R.

These structures, traditionally made of wood chosen by elders and craftsfolks, were used as the main vehicles of the people, connecting one island to another, where the seas and rivers became the people's roads. Although boats are believed to have been used in the archipelago for thousands of years since the arrival of humans through water, the earliest evidence of boat-making and the usage of boats in the country continues to be dated as 320 AD through the carbon-dating of the Butuan boats that are identified as remains of a gigantic balangay. Aside from the balangay, there are various styles and types of indigenous sea vehicles throughout the Philippines, such as the two-masted double-outrigger boat armadahan, the trading ship avang, the dugout canoes awang, the large sailing outrigger ship balaci√≥n, the native and widely-available watercraft bangka, the tiny canoe bangka anak-anak, the salamb√°w-lifting basnigan, the small double-outrigger sailboat bigiw, the dugout canoe birau, the dugout canoe buggoh, the flat-floored and roofed casco, the single mast and pointed chinarem, the rough sea open-deck boat Chinedkeran, the large double-outrigger plank boat djenging, the pirate warship garay, the large sailing outrigger ship guilalo, the open deck boat falua, the canoe junkun, the small motorized boat junkung, the large outrigger warship karakoa,Bartolom√© Leonardo de Argensola (1711). \\"The Discovery and Conquest of the Molucco and Philippine Islands.\\".

The weaving arts are composed of basket weaving, back-strap loom weaving, headgear weaving, fishnet weaving, and other forms of weaving. Cloth and mat weaving Expensive textiles are made through the intricate and difficult process called back-strap looming. Fibers such as Cotton, abaca, banana fiber, grass, and palm fiber are used in the Filipino weaving arts. There are many types of weaved cloths in the Philippines. Pinilian is an Ilocano cotton cloth weaved using a pangablan, where weaving styles of binakul, binetwagan, or tinumballitan are inputted. Bontoc weave revolves on the concept of centeredness, a key cultural motif among the Bontoc people. In its weave, the process starts with the sides called langkit until it journeys into the pa- ikid (side panels), fatawil (warp bands), and shukyong (arrows). Afterwards, the sinamaki weaving commences, where the tinagtakho (human figure), minatmata (diamond), and tinitiko (zigzag) are incorporated. The last is center, pa- khawa, which features the kan-ay (supplementary weft). Kalinga textiles are embedded into the geometry, where motifs include continuous lozenge pattern locally called inata-ata, and mother-of-pearl platelets called pawekan, among many others. The pi√±a fabric is considered the finest indigenous Filipino- origin textile. Those made by the Aklanon are the most prized, and are utilized in the national costumes of the country, such as barong Tagalog. Hablon is the fine textiles of the Karay-a and Hiligaynon people, which have been known from the epics of the people. The textile is usually used for Visayan patadyong and panuelo. The saputangan tapestry weave of the Yakan people is a highly skilled weaving utilizing the bunga-sama supplementary weft weave, the siniluan warp-floating pattern, the inalaman supplementary-weft technique, and the pinantupan weft band pattern. Mabal tabih of the Blaan people depicts crocodiles and curls. Weavers of the art can only be women, as the art is dedicated and taught by Furalo, goddess of weaving. Bagobo inabal utilizes abaca into creating two tube skirts, namely sinukla and bandira. Dagmay is the weaving art of the Mandaya, who use the mud-dye technique in their craft. Meranaw textile is used for the creation of the malong, among many other Maranao clothing. These crafts are imbibed with okir designs including potiok (bud), dapal or raon (leaf), pako (fern), pako rabong (growing fern) and katorai (flower). The pis syabit weave of the Tausug utilizes the free imagination of the weaver, as having no preset pattern for the weave is the cultural standard for making the high art. T'nalak is a fine textile of the Tboli crafted by the dream-weavers who are provided the designs and patterns through dreams by Fu Dalu, the deity of the abaca used in weaving. The oldest known warp ikat textile in Southeast Asia is the Banton cloth of Banton, Romblon, dated at 13th to 14th century. Unlike cloth weaving, mat weaving does not utilize a loom or similar equipment and instead relies on the craftsfolk's attention in hand-weaving. The difficult art form is known throughout the Philippines, with those made in Sulu, Basilan, and Samar being the most prized. In general traditions throughout the Philippines, mat-weaving is only done in shaded and cool placed as to preserve the integrity of the mats and their fibers. An example is the banig of Basey, where the weavers usually work inside a cave. Fibers used vary from banana, grass, palm, and many others.Rara: Art and Tradition of Mat Weaving in the Philippines, The Philippine Textile Council, Philippines, 2016, , File:Binakol, Northern Luzon, Abra, Tinguian, 20th century, IV.JPGBinakol File:Shaman blanket, northwestern Luzon, Abra, Tinguian people, 20th century, cotton, repp weave, Honolulu Museum of Art.JPGItneg shaman blanket File:T'nalak cloth of the T'boli people from Lake Sebu.jpgT'nalak File:Double ikat weaving from Sulu, Philippines, East-West Center.JPGA double ikat mat from Sulu File:Malong (tube skirt) from Mindanao, Honolulu Museum of Art 14180.1.JPGRayon Malong File:Pis siyabit (headscarf), Tausug people, Philippines, Honolulu Museum of Art 14451.1.JPGSilk Pis siyabit File:Tube shirt (patadyong) from the Philippines, Sulu Archipelago, Honolulu Museum of Art .jpgSilk Patadyong File:Banton Burial Cloth.JPGBanton cloth, the oldest surviving ikat textile in Southeast Asia (13th-14th century), a National Cultural Treasure File:Shirt MET 83.50.1 detail CP4.jpgFilipino shirt made of pi√±a (1850's) File:Mat from Leyte, Philippines, Honolulu Museum of Art 14151.1.JPGMat from Leyte File:Handkerchief (Philippines), 19th century (CH 18386747).jpgHandkerchief made of pi√±a and cotton (1800's) File:Panel (Philippines), early 19th century (CH 18386599).jpgPanel made of silk, pi√±a, and metallic threads (1800's) File:Scarf (Philippines), ca. 1770 (CH 18606679).jpgSilk and pi√±a scarf (1770) File:Textile (Philippines), 19th century (CH 18556915).jpgCotton and pi√±a textile (1800's) File:Textile (Philippines), 19th century (CH 18386669).jpgTextile made of pure pi√±a (1800's) File:Yardage for binakol , Abra, Tinguian, 20th century, Honolulu Museum of Art II.JPGYardage for binakol File:Skirt from northern Luzon, Honolulu Museum of Art 8363.1.JPGKalinga testile used in skirt File:Skirt from northern Luzon, late 1990s, cotton, glass beads, plain weave, warp-faced, Honolulu Museum of Art.JPGNorthern Luzon textile used in skirt File:Skirt from Bagobo, Mindanao, abac√° (Musa textilis), Honolulu Museum of Art 7908.1.JPGBagobo textile used in skirt File:Binakol, Northern Luzon, Abra, Tinguian, 20th century.JPGBinakol File:Philippine Dress (25091394331).jpgFilipino clothing exhibited at the Philippine Textiles Gallery File:Philippine Dress (24817045719).jpgFilipino clothing exhibited at the Philippine Textiles Gallery File:Philippine Dress (24557717033).jpgFilipino clothing exhibited at the Philippine Textiles Gallery File:Philippine Dress (24553579394).jpgFilipino clothing exhibited at the Philippine Textiles Gallery File:Philippine Dress (25158171516).jpgFilipino clothing exhibited at the Philippine Textiles Gallery File:Woman's costume from the Philippines, Honolulu Museum of Art 5752.1.JPGTerno (1920's) File:Woman's skirt from Mindanao, Honolulu Museum of Art 4716.1.jpgSkirt File:Mindanao Bangsamoro Weaving & Fabric Art (25090421801).jpgVarious Filipino textiles at the National Museum File:Sash from the Sulu Archipelago, Honolulu Museum of Art 5881.1.JPGSash File:Mestiza dress, Philippines, 1930s, Honolulu Museum of Art accession 5750.1.JPGMestiza dress (1930's) Basketry The fine art of basket weaving in the Philippines has developed intricate designs and forms directed for specific purposes such as harvesting, rice storage, travel package, sword case, and so on. The art is believed to have arrived in the archipelago due to human migration, where those at the north were the first to learn the art form. The finest vessel basket crafts made, however, comes from the ethnic groups of Palawan, in the southwest. The Batak of Palawan has utilized the craft into high art, as well as retaining their craft's status as functional art. Intricate basketry can also be found among the Mamanwa, various Negrito groups, Mangyans, Ivatan, and many others. Materials used in basketry differ per ethnic group. Some important materials include bamboo, rattan, pandan, cotton cloth tassel, nito, beeswax, abaca, buri, bark, and dyes. In the same manner, each ethnic group has their own basketry patterns, which include closed-crossed over under weave, closed bamboo double twill weave, spaced rattan pentagon pattern, and closed tetrahedron buri, among many others. A few of the many basketry products from the Philippines include the tupil (lunch box), bukug (basket), kabil (carrying basket), uppig (lunch basket), tagga-i (rice basket), bay'ung (basket-pouch), lig-o (winnowing tray), and binga (bag). The weaving traditions of basketry have also been influenced by modern demands. Weaved headpieces are prevalent throughout the Philippines, wherein multiple cultures utilize a variety of fibers to connect mediums forming Filipino headgears such as the Ivatan's vakul, the head-cloth of the Manobo, and the snake headpiece of the Bontoc. The weaving traditions pertaining to fish traps and gears in the Philippines are expansive, of which the Ilocano people, possibly, possess the vastest array of fish gears among the archipelago's ethnic groups. Notable weaved fish traps include bubo, barekbek, and pamurakan.

These items usually represents either an ancestor or a deity who aids the spirit of a loved one to go into the afterlife properly. Ancient carved burial urns have been found in many areas, notably in the Cotabato region. The Limestone tombs of Kamhantik are elaborate tombs in Quezon province, believed to initially possess rock covers signifying that they were sarcophagi. These tombs are believed to have been originally roofed, as evidenced by holes marked onto them, where beams have been placed. Stone grave marks are also notable, with the people of Tawi-Tawi, and other groups using the carved marks with okir motif to aid the dead. In many areas, sides of mountains are carved to form burial caves, especially in the highlands of northern Luzon. The Kabayan Mummy Burial Caves is a prime example. Marble carvings are also famous, especially in its epicenter in Romblon. Majority of the marble crafts are currently meant for export, mostly Buddhist statues and related works. With the arrival of Christianity, Christian stone carvings became widespread. Most of which were either parts of a church such as facades or interior statues, or statues and other crafts intended for personal altars.Paradise in Stone: Representations of New World Plants and Animals on Spanish Colonial Churches in the Philippines, RAG Reyes - Art, Trade, and Cultural Mediation in Asia, 1600‚Äì1950, 2019 A notable stone carving on a church is the facade of Miagao Church. Ivory carving is an art practiced in the Philippines for more than a thousand years, with the oldest known ivory artifact known is the Butuan Ivory Seal, dated 9th‚Äì12th century. The religious carvings of ivory, or garing as locally known, became widespread after the direct importation of ivory into the Philippines from mainland Asia, where carvings focused on Christian icons, such as Madonna with Child, the Christ Child, and the Sorrowful Mother. Many of the ivory carvings from the Philippines have gold and silver designs. The ivory trade in the Philippines boomed because of the demand for ivory carvings, and continued up to the 21st century. In recent years, the Philippine government has been cracking down on the illegal ivory trade. In 2013, the Philippines became the first country in the world to destroy its ivory stock, to show solidarity among like-minded nations against the ivory trade which has decimated the world's elephant and rhino populations. Horns of dead carabaos have been used as a substitute to ivory in the Philippines for centuries.

As diverse as Filipino folk literature is, many of the literary works continue to develop, with some being documented by scholars and inputted into manuscripts, tapes, video recordings, or other documentary forms.Outline of Philippine mythology, FL Jocano - 1969 - Centro Escolar University File:Pasyon, pabasa.jpgPabasa during the Pasyon File:Igorot Ifugao Courtship Dance and Salidumay by DKK.webmSalidumay chanting after a courtship dance File:Singkil dance post card.jpgSingkil, a tradition depicting the stories from the Darangen, a world intangible heritage and a National Cultural Treasure File:Banaue Rice Terraces Harvest.jpgAn Ifugao chanting the Hudhud ni Aliguyon while harvesting, a world intangible heritage and a National Cultural Treasure File:The rotation of Visayan Philippine bakunawa.pngBakunawa, a deity from the Visayas and Bicol, in a divination-rotation chart as explained in Signosan (1919) File:Manananggal.jpgA manananggal drawing, as depicted in folk stories File:Buraq sculpture from Mindanao Philippines.jpgthumbA buraq sculpture, as depicted in folk stories File:Mariang Makiling statue at the University of the Philippines in Los Ba√±os.jpgSculpture depicting Makiling, the protector- goddess of Mount Makiling File:Banaue Rice Terraces and its statue friend.JPGA hogang, fern-trunk statue, of a god protecting boundaries in Ifugao File:Kaamulan Festival - Tableau Presentation.jpgPerformance at the Kaamulan, depicting gods and heroes from the people's ancient religions =Folk graphic and plastic arts= The fields under folk graphic and plastic arts are tattooing, folk writing, and folk drawing and painting. Folk writing (calligraphy) The Philippines has numerous indigenous scripts collectively called as suyat, each of which has their own forms and styles of calligraphy. Various ethno-linguistic groups in the Philippines prior to Spanish colonization in the 16th century up to the independence era in the 21st century have used the scripts with various mediums. By the end of colonialism, only four of the suyat scripts survived and continue to be used by certain communities in everyday life. These four scripts are hanun√≥'o/hanunoo of the Hanuno'o Mangyan people, buhid/build of the Buhid Mangyan people, Tagbanwa script of the Tagbanwa people, and palaw'an/pala'wan (ibalnan) of the Palaw'an people. All four scripts were inscribed in the UNESCO Memory of the World Programme, under the name Philippine Paleographs (Hanunoo, , Tagbanua and Pala‚Äôwan), in 1999. Due to dissent from colonialism, many artists and cultural experts have revived the usage of suyat scripts that went extinct due to Spanish persecution. These scripts being revived include the kulitan script of the Kapampangan people, the badlit script of various Visayan ethnic groups, the iniskaya script of the Eskaya people, the baybayin script of the Tagalog people, the sambali script of the Sambal people, the basahan script of the Bicolano people, the sulat pangasinan script of the Pangasinense people, and the kur-itan or kurdita script of the Ilocano people, among many others.Estudio de los antiguos alfabetos Filipinos (1895), Cipriano Marcilla y Mart√≠n, Tipo-litografia del asilo de hu√©rfanos Aside from the native suyat calligraphies of the Philippines, Spanish-derived calligraphy and Arabic calligraphy of jawi and kirim are also used by certain communities and art groups in the Philippines.Surat Sug:: Jawi tradition in Southern Philippines, CA Abubakar, 2013The poem of Bidasari in the Maranao language, M Julian - Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land-en Volkenkunde, 2001 In the last decade, calligraphy based on the suyat scripts has met popularity surges and revival.

The oldest folk drawing is the rock drawings and engravings which include the petroglyphs in Angono (Rizal), which was created during the Neolithic age of the Philippines, corresponding to 6000 BC to 2000 BC. The drawings have been interpreted as religious in nature, with infant drawings made to relieve the sickness of children. Another known petroglyph is in Alab (Bontoc), which is dated to be not later than 1500 BC, and represents symbols of fertility such as the pudenda. In contrast, ancient folk drawings as petrographs can be found in specific sites in the country as well. The petrographs of Pe√±ablanca in Cagayan compose charcoal drawings. The petrographs of Singnapan in southern Palawan are also drawn with charcoal. The petrograhs in Anda (Bohol) comppose drawings made with red hematite. Recently discovered petrographs in Monreal (Ticao) include drawings of monkeys, human faces, worms or snakes, plants, dragonflies, and birds. Folk paintings, like folk drawings, are works of art that usually include depictions of folk culture. Evidences suggest that the people of the archipelago have been painting and glazing their potteries for thousands of years. Pigments used in paintings range from gold, yellow, reddish purple, green, white, blue-green, to blue. Statues and other creations have also been painted on by various ethnic groups, using a variety of colors. Paintings on skin with elaborate designs is also a known folk art which continue to be practiced in the Philippines, especially among the Yakan people. Tattooing was introduced by Austronesian ancestors thousands of years ago, where it developed into cultural symbols in a variety of ethnic groups.Filipino tattoos: Ancient to modern L Wilcken - 2010 - Schiffer PublishingAn Ethnography of Pantaron Manobo Tattooing (Pangotoeb): Towards a Heuristic Schema in Understanding Manobo Indigenous Tattoos, AMM Ragragio, MD Paluga - Southeast Asian Studies, 2019The fading batek: problematizing the decline of traditional tattoos in the Philippine Cordillera Region, FPA Demeterio III - The Journal of the South East Asia Research, 2017 Although the practice has been in place for thousands of years, its documentation was first put on paper in the 16th century, where the bravest Pintados (people of central and eastern Visayas) were the most tattooed.

But perhaps the most popular tattooed people in the Philippines are the highland peoples of Luzon collectively called the Igorot, where they are traditionally tattooed prior to colonization. Presently, only the small village of Tinglayan in Kalinga province has traditional tattoo artists crafting the batok, headed by master tattooist and Kalinga matriarch Whang-od. In the last decade, the many traditional tattoo arts of the Philippines has experienced a revival after centuries of decline.

Initially, European craftfolks managed the production of stained glasses in the country, but later on, Filipino craftfolks also entered the scene, notably since the 20th century. A important set of stained glass creations is those from the Manila Cathedral, where the pot glass technique was used. The Marian theme is a vivid depiction throughout the glasses, with stern focus on Mary's life and saints in their Marian reverence.

Indigenous Filipino hats were widely used in the daily lives of the people until the 20th century when they were replaced by Western- style hats. They are currently worn during certain occasions, such as festivals, rituals, or in theatre. The art of mask creation is both an indigenous and imported tradition, as certain communities have mask-making practices prior to colonization, while some mask-making traditions were introduced through trade from parts of Asia and the West. Today, these masks are worn mostly during festivals, Moriones Festival, and MassKara Festival. A related art is puppet-making, which is notable for its products used in theater plays and festivals such as the Higantes Festival. Most indigenous masks are made of wood, where these works of art are almost always rudimentary as they represent beings outside basic human comprehension. Gold masks made specifically for the dead also abound in the country, specifically in the Visayas region. However, the practice of gold mask making ceased due to Spanish colonization. Masks made of bamboo and paper used in Lucban depict the proverbial Filipino farming family. Masks of Marinduque are used in pantomimic dramatization, while masks of Bacolod depict egalitarian values, showing ancient traditions of equality among the people, regardless of economic standards. In theater, various masks are notable among epics, especially those related to the Ramayana and Mahabharata.

Among the more than a hundred ethnic groups in the Philippines, the most accessorized is possibly the Kalinga people. The Gaddang people also exhibit a very accessorized culture.Indigenous garments and accessories of the g'addang in barangay ngileb: documentation on production, A Garra - Journal Sampurasun, 2016 The most famous accessories utilized by numerous ethnic groups in the Philippines are omege-shaped fertility objects called a lingling-o, which are used from the northern islands of Batanes to the southern islands of Palawan. The oldest lingling-o currently known is dated at 500 BC and is made of nephrite jade. Shells have traditionally been used as fine mediums for accessories in the Philippines as well.f The art of gold craftsmanship is prevalent among Filipino ethnic groups, where the most known goldsmiths came from Butuan. Regalia, jewelries, ceremonial weapons, teeth ornamentation, and ritualistic and funerary objects made of high-quality gold have been excavated in many Filipino sites, attesting the archipelago's flourished gold culture between the tenth and thirteenth centuries. While certain gold craft techniques have been lost due to colonization, later techniques influenced by other cultures have also been adopted by Filipino goldsmiths.

They are prized in many communities in the Philippines, where possibly the most sought after are those made by the Maranao, specifically from Tugaya, Lanao del Sur. Metal crafts of the Moro people have been made to decorate a variety of objects, where all are imbibed with the traditional okir motif. Numerous metal crafts are also utilized to design and give emphasis to religious objects such as altars, Christian statues, and clothing, among many other things. Apalit, Pampanga is one of the major centers for the craft. Gold has been utilized in many ornamental crafts of the Philippines, where majority that have survived colonialism and looting are human accessories with elaborate ancient designs.

Important pottery artifacts from the Philippines include the Manunggul Jar (890-710 BCE) and the Maitum anthropomorphic pottery (5 BC-225 AD). High-fired potteries were first made around 1,000 years ago, which led to what scholars describe as the 'ceramic age' in the Philippines. The ceramic trade also became prevalent, where potteries and shards as far as the Arab world, possibly Egypt, and East Asia has been found in the Philippines according to the National Commission for Culture and the Arts. Specific jars were also traded directly to Japan. Prior to colonization, porcelain imported from foreign lands have already become popular among many communities in the archipelago as seen in the many archaeological porcelains found throughout the islands. While oral literature from Cebu have noted that porcelain were already being produced by the natives during the time of Cebu's early rulers, prior to the arrival of colonizers in the 16th century.Ouano-Savellon, R. (2014). Philippine Quarterly of Culture and Society Vol. 42, No. 3/4: Aginid Bayok Sa Atong Tawarik: Archaic Cebuano and Historicity in a Folk Narrative. University of San Carlos Publications. Despite this, the earliest known porcelain made by natives of the Philippines is officially dated at 1900s, as porcelain found in Filipino archaeological sites were all branded by the time of their rediscovery as \\"imported\\", which has become a major debate today. The late 19th to early 20th century led to Filipinos working as porcelain artisans in Japan to fly back into the Philippines, re-introducing the process of making the craft. All but one porcelain from the era survived World War II. Notable folk clay art in the country include The Triumph of Science over Death (1890), and Mother's Revenge (1894), Popular potteries in the country include tapayan and palayok. The art of pottery has met media attention in recent years, as various techniques and designs are continually being crafted by Filipino artisans.

Among these art forms include non-ornamental metal crafts, martial arts, supernatural healing arts, medicinal arts, and constellation traditions, among many others. Non-ornamental metal crafts Non-ornamental metal crafts are metal products that stand on their own. These crafts are usually already beautiful as they are, and seldom need ornamental metal crafts to further their indigenous aesthetics. Each ethnic group has their own terms for artisans specializing in metal works, with the Moro people being one of the foremost creators of quality metal works, which usually are decorated with the okir motif.Handbook of the Collection of Musical Instruments in the United States National Museum, Bulletin, Issues 136-138, by Frances Densmore Metal crafts are also notable among the craftsfolk of various craft epicenters of the country, such as Baguio in the north. Hispanic metal crafts are prevalent among lowlanders. These crafts usually include giant bells, where the largest in Asia is conserved at Panay Church. Deity crafts made of metals, notably gold, has been found in the Philippines as well, with the Agusan image being a notable example.

Many of the swords are specifically made for ceremonial functions and agricultural functions, while certain types are used specifically for offensive and defensive warfare. The most known Filipino sword is the kampilan, a well-defined sharp blade with an aesthetically-protruding spikelet along the flat side of the tip and a pommel which depicts one of four sacred creatures, a bakunawa (dragon), a buaya (crocodile), a kalaw (hornbill), or a kakatua (cockatoo). Other Filipino bladed weapons include the winged dagger balarao, the convex sword balasiong, the butterfly knife balisong, the modernized sword balisword, the slash-hack sword bangkung, the top-concave sword banyal, the leaf sword barong, the wide-tipped batangas, the machete bolo, the rice-leaf sword dahong palay, the dagger-kalis gunong, the double- edged anti-slip gayang, the machete golok, the wavy sword kalis, the claw knife karambit, the battle axe panabas, the white sword pinut√≠, the machete pirah, the last-resort knife gunong, the devastation sword susuwat, the sawtooth sword tagan, and the wide-tipped utak.

The most famous is Arnis (also called kali and eskrima), the national sport and martial art of the Philippines, which emphasize weapon-based fighting styles with sticks, knives, bladed weapons and various improvised weapons as well as open hand techniques. Arnis has met various cultural changes throughout history, where it was also known as estoque, estocada, and garrote during the Spanish occupation. Spanish recorderd first encountered the prevalent martial art as paccalicali-t to the Ibanags, didya/kabaroan) to the Ilocanos, sitbatan/kalirongan to Pangasinenses, sinawali (\\"to weave\\") to the Kapampangans, calis/pananandata (use of weapons) to the Tagalogs, pagaradman to the Ilonggos, and kaliradman to the Cebuanos. Unarmed martial techniques include Pangamot of the Bisaya, suntukan of the Tagalog, Rizal's sikaran of the Tagalog, dumog of the Karay-a, buno of the Igorot people, and yaw-yan. Some impact martial weapons include baston or olisi, bangkaw or tongat, dulo- dulo, and tameng. Edged martial weapons include daga/cuchillo which utilizes gunong, punyal and barung or barong, balisong, karambit which used blades similar to tiger claws, espada which utilizes kampilan, ginunting, pinuti and talibong, itak, kalis which uses poison-bladed daggers known as kris, golok, sibat, sundang, lagaraw, ginunting, and pinunting.

The majority of mainstream Filipino dishes that compose Filipino cuisine are from the cuisines of the Bikol, Chavacano, Hiligaynon, Ilocano, Kapampangan, Maranao, Pangasinan, Cebuano (or Bisaya), Tagalog, and Waray ethnolinguistic tribes. The style of cooking and the food associated with it have evolved over many centuries from their Austronesian origins to a mixed cuisine of Indian, Chinese, Spanish, and American influences, in line with the major waves of influence that had enriched the cultures of the archipelago, as well as others adapted to indigenous ingredients and the local palate. \\"Philippine Cuisine.\\" Balitapinoy.net . Accessed July 2011. Dishes range from the very simple, like a meal of fried salted fish and rice, to the complex paellas and cocidos created for fiestas of Spanish origin. Popular dishes include: lech√≥n (whole roasted pig), longganisa (Philippine sausage), tapa (cured beef), torta (omelette), adobo (chicken or pork braised in garlic, vinegar, oil and soy sauce, or cooked until dry), kaldereta (meat in tomato sauce stew), mechado (larded beef in soy and tomato sauce), puchero (beef in bananas and tomato sauce), afritada (chicken or pork simmered in tomato sauce with vegetables), kare-kare (oxtail and vegetables cooked in peanut sauce), pinakbet (kabocha squash, eggplant, beans, okra, and tomato stew flavored with shrimp paste), crispy pata (deep-fried pig's leg), hamonado (pork sweetened in pineapple sauce), sinigang (meat or seafood in sour broth), pancit (noodles), and lumpia (fresh or fried spring rolls).

The shell industry in the country prioritizes crafts made of capiz shells, which are seen in various products ranging from windows, statues, lamps, and many others. Lantern-making is also a traditional art form in the country. The art began after the introduction of Christianity, and many lanterns (locally called parol) appear in Filipino streets and in front of houses, welcoming the Christmas season, which usually begins in September and ends in January in the Philippines, creating the longest Christmas season of any country in the world. A notable festival celebrating Christmas and lanterns is the Giant Lantern Festival, which exhibits gigantic lanterns crafted by Filipino artisans. The art of pyrotechnics is popular in the country during the New Year celebrations and the days before it during the Christmas season. Since 2010, the Philippines has been hosting the Philippine International Pyromusical Competition, the world's largest pyrotechnic competition, previously called the World Pyro Olympics. Lacquerware is an introduced art form in the Philippines. Although prized, only a few Filipino artisans have ventured into the art form. Filipino researchers are recently studying the possibility of turning coconut oil in lacquer.Potential of virgin coconut oil in the production of lacquer enamel paint, LD dela Cruz, 2010The use of non-wood forest products by migrants in a new settlement: experiences of a Visayan community in Palawan, Philippines, C Lacuna-Richman - Journal of ethnobiology and ethnomedicine, 2006Later prehistory of the Philippines: colonial images and archaeology, E Bacus - Archaeology International, 1998 Paper arts are prevalent in many communities in the Philippines. Some examples of paper art include the taka papier-m√¢ch√© of Laguna and the pabalat craft of Bulacan. One form of leaf folding art in the country is the puni, which utilizes palm leaves to create various forms such as birds and insects. Bamboo arts are widespread in the country, with various products being made of bamboo from kitchen utensils, toys, furniture, to musical instruments such as the Las Pi√±as Bamboo Organ, the world's oldest and only organ made of bamboo. A notable bamboo art is the bulakaykay, which bamboos are intentionally bristled to create elaborate and large arches. Floristry is a fine art that continues to be popular during certain occasions such as festivals, birthdays, and Undas. The art of leaf speech, including its language and its deciphering, is a notable art among the Dumagat people, who use a mixture of leaves to express themselves to others and to send secret messages. The art of shamanism and its related arts such as medicinal and healing arts are found in all ethnic groups throughout the country, with each group having their own unique concepts of shamanism and healing practices. Philippine shamans are regarded as sacred by their respective ethnic groups. The introduction of Abrahamic religions, by way of Islam and Christianity, downgraded many shamanitic traditions, with Spanish and American colonizers demeaning the native faiths during the colonial era. Shamans and their practices continue in certain places in the country, although conversions to Abrahamic faiths continue to interfere with their indigenous life-ways.Grace Nono, Song of the Babaylan: Living Voices, Medicines, Spiritualities of Philippine Ritualist-Oralist-Healers (Quezon City: Institute of Spirituality in Asia, 2013) The art of constellation and cosmic reading and interpretation is a fundamental tradition among all Filipino ethnic groups, as the stars are used to interpret the world's standing for communities to conduct proper farming, fishing, festivities, and other important activities.

Philippine dance is influenced by the folk performing arts of the country, as well as its Hispanic traditions. Many styles also developed due to global influences. Dances of the Igorot dances, such as banga, Moro dances, such as pangalay and singkil, Lumad dances, such as kuntaw and kadal taho and lawin-lawin, Hispanic dances, such as maglalatik and subli, have been inputted into contemporary Filipino dances. Ballet has also become a popular dance form in the Philippines since the early 20th century. Pinoy hip hop music has influenced specific dances in the country, where many have adapted global standards in hip hop and break dances. Many choreographers in the Philippines focus on both traditional and Westernized dances, with certain dance companies focusing on Hispanic and traditional forms of dance.CONTEMPORARY DANCE IN THE PHILIPPINES, Reynaldo G.

The basis of Filipino music is the vast musical tangible and intangible heritage of the many ethnic groups in the archipelago, where some of which have been influenced by other Asian and Western cultures, notably Hispanic and American music. Philippine folk music includes the chanting of epic poetry, such as the Darangen and Hudhud ni Aliguyon, and singing of folk music traditions through various means such as the Harana. Some Filipino music genre include Manila sound which brought hopeful themes amidst the decaying status of the country during the martial law years, Pinoy reggae which focuses on dancehall music faithful to the expressions of Jamaican reggae, Pinoy rock which encompasses rock music with Filipino cultural sensibilities, Pinoy pop which is one of the most popular genre in the country, Tagonggo which is music traditionally played by finely-dressed male musicians, Kapanirong which is a serenade genre,The Maranao Man.

Theater in the Philippines is Austronesian in character, which is seen in rituals, mimetic dances, and mimetic customs of the people. Plays with Spanish influences have affected Filipino theater and drama, notably the komedya, the sinakulo, the playlets, the sarswela, and the Filipino drama. Puppetry, such as carrillo, is also a notable theater art. In contrast, theater with Anglo- American influence have also mixed with various art forms such as bodabil and the plays in English. Modern and original plays by Filipinos have also influenced Philippine theater and drama with the usage of representational and presentational styles drawn from contemporary modern theater and revitalized traditional forms from within or outside the country.

Painting Folk painting has always been part of various cultures in the Philippines. Petroglyphs and petrographs are the earliest known folk drawings and paintings in the country, with the oldest made during the Neolithic age. Human figures, frogs, lizards, along with other designs have been depicted. They may have been mostly symbolic representations and are associated with healing and sympathetic magic. The influences brought by other Asian and Western cultures artistically advanced the art of paintings. In the 16th century and throughout the colonization era, paintings of religious propaganda for the spread of Catholicism became rampant. Majority of these paintings are essentially part of church structures, such as ceilings and walls. At the same time, non- religious paintings were also known. Notable painting during the time include the image of Nuestra Senora de la Soledad de Porta Vaga (1692)Panlilio, Erlinda Enriquez (2003). \\"Consuming passions: Philippine collectibles\\", pg. 70. Jaime C. Laya. . and paintings at Camarin de da Virgen (1720). In the 19th century, wealthier, educated Filipinos introduced more secular Filipino art, causing art in the Philippines to deviate from religious motifs. The use of watercolour paintings increased and the subject matter of paintings began to include landscapes, Filipino inhabitants, Philippine fashion, and government officials. Portrait paintings featured the painters themselves, Filipino jewelry, and native furniture. Landscape paintings portrayed scenes of average Filipinos partaking in their daily tasks. These paintings often showcased ornately painted artists' names. These paintings were done on canvas, wood, and a variety of metals. Notable watercolor paintings were done in the Tipos del Pa√≠s style or the Letras y figuras style. Notable oil paintings of the 19th century include Basi Revolt paintings (1807), Sacred Art of the Parish Church of Santiago Apostol (1852), Spoliarium (1884), La Bulaque√±a (1895), and The Parisian Life (1892). In the American occupation, a notable Filipino painting was The Progress of Medicine in the Philippines (1953). After World War II, painting were heavily influenced by the effects of war. Common themes included battle scenes, destruction, and the suffering of the Filipino people. Nationalistic themes in painting continued amidst the war's effects. Prime examples include International Rice Research Institute (1962) and the Manila Mural (1968) Paintings of the 20th-21st century have showcased the native cultures of the Philippines, as part of the spread of nationalism. Notable paintings during the era include Chickens (1968) and Sarimanok series (late 20th century). Some works have also criticized the lingering colonial viewpoints in the country, such as discrimination against darker-skinned people and the negative effects of colonialism. Notable artistic pieces of this topic are Filipina: A racial identity crisis (1990's),\\"Philippines Fiesta !\\", beMuse Magazine, Singapore National Heritage Board, 2009James M. Henslin, \\"Essentials of Sociology: A Down to Earth Approach - Sixth Edition\\", Allyn and Bacon, Needham Heights, MA, 2006 and The Brown Man's Burden (2003). Numerous works of art have been made specifically as protest art against state authoritarian rule, human rights violations, and fascism.

Various materials can be used in sculptures, ranging from metals, wax, glass, wood, plastic, bamboo, and many more. The art of sculpture in the country originated from the indigenous cultures of the natives, which includes art works made of wood, metal, stone, corals, grass, rattan, bamboo, and other mediums.Sculpture in the Philippines: from Anito to assemblage and other essays, A Guillermo - 1991 - Metropolitan Museum of Manila Notable non-folk sculptures include Oblation, which reflects selfless dedication and service to the nation, Rizal Monument, depicting Filipino martyr and scholar Jose Rizal, Tandang Sora National Shrine, depicting the revolutionary mother of the Katipunan Melchora Aquino, Lapu-Lapu Shrine, which depicts the classical-era hero Lapu-Lapu who vanquished the colonizers during his lifetime, People Power Monument, which celebrates the power and activism of the people over its government, Filipina Comfort Women, which immortalizes the suffering of and judicial need for Filipina comfort women during World War II, and the Bonifacio Monument, depicting the revolutionary hero Andres Bonifacio.

Maps were also printed through the art form, which includes the 1734 Velarde map. Printmaking has since diversified in the country, which has included woodblock printing and other forms. Photography started in the country in the 1840s, upon the introduction of the photographic equipment. Photos were used during the colonial era as mediums for news, tourism, instruments for anthropology and documentation, and as a means for the Spanish and Americans to assert their perceived social status onto the natives to support colonial propaganda.Guardiola, Juan. The Philippine Imaginary, Sociedad Espa√±ola de Acci√≥n Cultural en el Exterior (SEACEX), Casa Asia and Seacex.es (undated) , retrieved on: August 11, 2007 This later changed upon Philippine independence, where photography became widely used by the people for personal documentation and commercial usage. Other forms of visual arts in the Philippines are installation art, mixed media works, illustration, graphic arts, performance art, and imaging.

In some cultures, calligraphy on various mediums were utilized to create literary works. An example is the ambahan of the Hanunoo Mangyan. Literature under the colonial regime focused greatly on Spanish-language works under Spanish occupation, then adjusting to the English-language under American occupation. From 1593-1800, majority of literary arts made in the Philippines were Spanish-language religious works, with a noble book being Doctrina Christiana (1593) and a Tagalog rendition of the Pasyon (1704).The Sources of Gaspar Aquino de Belen's Pasyon, Rene B. Javellana, Philippine Studies,Vol. 32, No. 3 (Third Quarter 1984), pp. 305-321, Aeneo de Manila University There are also works in the colonial eras that are written in native languages, mostly religious and government scripts for the propagation of colonialism. Nevertheless, Filipino literary works without colonial propaganda were made by local authors as well. At the same time, certain folk (oral) literature were inputted into manuscripts by Filipino writers such as the 17th century manuscript of the ancient Ilocano epic Biag ni Lam-ang.Manuel, E. Arsenio (1963). \\"A Survey of Philippine Folk Epics\\". Asian Folklore Studies. 22: 1‚Äì76. In 1869, the epic Florante at Laura was published, inputting fiction writing with Asian and European themes. In 1878 or 1894, the first modern play in any Philippine language, Ang Babai nga Huaran, was written in Hiligaynon. By the 19th century, the formative years of Spanish literature in the country moved forward into what became the nationalist stage of 1883-1903. During this era, the first novel written by a Filipino, N√≠nay, was published. Works of literary art critical of colonial rulers became known as well, such as the 1887 Noli Me T√°ngere and the 1891 El filibusterismo.Literatura Filipina en Castellano, Madrid, 1974.

During this era, works in native languages and in English started to boom as well. The go-to book of the working class, Banaag at Sikat, was published in 1906, where the literary work dives into the concepts of socialism, capitalism, and the united laborers.Santos, Lope K.

The films under the period were overseen by the government, with various filmmakers being arrested. A notable film made during the period is Himala, which tackles the concept of religious fanaticism. The period after martial rule dealt with more serious topics, with independent films being made by many filmmakers. The 1990s saw the emergence of films related to Western films, along with the continued popularity of films focusing on the realities of poverty.

Non-folk architecture The basis of Filipino non-folk architecture is the folk architecture of various ethnic groups within the Philippines. The diversity in vernacular architecture range from the bahay kubo, bahay na bato, torogan, idjang, payyo, and ethnic shrines and mosques. Upon the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, various Western architectures were introduced such as Baroque, which was used to establish the Manila Cathedral and Boljoon Church. However, due to the geologic nature of the islands, the Baroque architecture was later turned into a unique style now known as Earthquake Baroque, which was used into the building of Binondo Church, Daraga Church, and the world heritage sites of Paoay Church, Miagao Church, San Agustin Church, and Santa Maria Church. Throughout the colonial eras, from Spanish to American rule, various architecture styles were introduced. A notable Gothic Revival building is the San Sebastian Church, the only all-steel church in Asia. Beaux-Arts became popular among the wealthy classes. A notable example is the Lopez Heritage House. Art Deco continues to be a popular architecture in certain Filipino communities, with the city of Sariaya considered as the country's Art Deco capital. Italian and Italian-Spanish architecture can be seen on certain buildings such as Fort Santiago and The Ruins. Stick-style is notable among some wood buildings such as the Silliman Hall. Neoclassical is perhaps the most vividly depicted in the Philippines, as many government buildings follow the architecture. Examples include the Baguio Cathedral, Manila Central Post Office, and the National Museum of Fine Arts. Even after independence, architecture continued to evolve, with the usage of Brutalist architecture during the martial law era. After the restoration of democracy, a revival of indigenous architecture into neo-vernacular architecture occurred in the late 20th century and the 21st century. These buildings and structures have become iconic bases for Filipino nationalism and ethnic representation. Modern-style architecture is presently a popular style in the Philippines, with some examples include the Saint Andrew the Apostle Church and the Manila Hotel. In the present era, demolitions of culturally important buildings and structures have happened, despite the enactment of laws disallowing such acts. Many cultural workers and architects have made advances to stop the demolitions of certain buildings and structures.

Interior design in the Philippines has been influenced by indigenous Filipino interiors and cultures, Hispanic styles, American styles, Japanese styles, modern design, avant-garde, tropical design, neo-vernacular, international style, and sustainable design. As interior spaces are expressions of culture, values, and aspirations, they have been heavily researched on by Filipino scholars.Interior Design in the Philippines: A Retrospect of Spaces and Culture, Edith Oliveros and Raquel Baltazar-Florendo, 2013,University of Santo Tomas Publishing House Common interior design styles in the country for decades have been Tropical, Filipino, Japanese, Mediterranean, Chinese, Moorish, Victorian, and Baroque, while Avant Garde Industrial, Tech and Trendy, Metallic Glam, Rustic Luxe, Eclectic Elegance, Organic Opulence, Design Deconstructed, and Funk Art have recently become popular. Landscape architecture in the Philippines initially followed the client's opulence, however, in recent years, the emphasis has been on the ecosystem and sustainability. Urban planning is a key economic and cultural issue in the Philippines, notably due to the high population of the country, marked with problems on infrastructures such as transportation. Many urban planners have initiated proposals for the uplifting of urban areas, especially in congested and flood-prone Metro Manila.

Industrial design Industrial design, or the art where design precedes manufacture for products intended for mass production, has been a key factor in improving the Philippine economy. Many artistic creations in the country are made through research and development, which interplay with aesthetics that allures customers. Packaging of food and other products, as well as the main aesthetics of certain products such as gadgets, are prime examples of industrial design, along with the aesthetics of mass-produced vehicles, kitchen equipment and utensils, furniture, and many others.Sustainable industrial design and waste management: cradle-to-cradle for sustainable development, S El Haggar - 2010Taking the right road to inclusive growth: Industrial upgrading and diversification in the Philippines, N Usui - 2012 A major annual event in the Philippines which focuses on industrial design, among others, is Design Week held in the third week of March and October since 2011.

Indigenous fashion inputs various materials created through the traditional arts, such as weaving and ornamental arts. Unlike industrial design, which is intended for objects and structures, fashion design is intended as a whole bodily package. Filipino fashion is founded on both the indigenous fashion aesthetics of the people, as well as aesthetics introduced by other Asian people and Western people, through trade and colonization. During the last years of the Hispanic era, Ilustrado fashion became prevalent, with majority of the population dressing in Hispanized outfits. This later slowly changed after the importation of American culture.Dress, Status, and Identity in the Philippines: Pineapple Fiber Cloth and Ilustrado Fashion, M Roces - Fashion Theory, 2013 In modern Filipino fashion, budget-friendly choices prevail, although expensive fashion statements are also available, notably for those in a so-called high society.Investigating second-hand fashion trade and consumption in the Philippines: Expanding existing discourses, VL Isla - Journal of Consumer Culture, 2013 Iconic outfits utilizing indigenous Filipino textiles, without culturally appropriating them, have recently become popular in the country.

Museums are important vessels for the protection and conservation of Philippine arts. A number of museums in the Philippines possess works of art that have been declared as National Treasures, notably the National Museum of the Philippines in Manila. Other notable museums include Ayala Museum, Negros Museum, Museo Sugbo, Lopez Museum, and Metropolitan Museum of Manila. University museums also hold a vast array of art. Libraries and archives are also important, among the most known are the National Library of the Philippines and the National Archives of the Philippines. Various organizations, groups, and universities have also conserved the arts, especially the performing and craft arts. Many conservation measures have been undertaken by both private and public institutions and organizations in the country, in addressing the heritage management in the Philippines. The enactment of laws such as the National Cultural Heritage Act have aided in Filipino art conservation. The act also established the country's repository of all culturally-related heritage, the Philippine Registry of Cultural Property. The National Commission for Culture and the Arts is currently the official cultural arm of the Philippine government. There have been proposals to establish a Philippine Department of Culture.

After high school, he attended the University of Oregon to train under track coach Bill Hayward. World record On July 4, 1936, Varoff vaulted 14 ft in (4.43 m) at the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU)'s national championship meet, setting a new world record. However, the Olympic Trials were held separately the following week; at the Trials, Varoff only placed fourth and failed to qualify for the United States team for the 1936 Olympics. Varoff won the AAU championship again in 1939; he set his personal best, 14 ft in (4.46 m), at the 1937 AAU meet, but lost on countback as three other men also cleared the same height. With the cancellation of the 1940 and 1944 Olympics due to World War II, he never competed in the Olympics. World War II Varoff joined the United States Army Air Forces during World War II and achieved the rank of Captain. His B-29 was shot down over China and reported as missing in action on December 7, 1944. He returned safely to his base six weeks later. He later reported that he and his crew had to bail out over China following a bombing mission. Legacy Following the war, Varoff returned to San Francisco.

The International Standard for the measurement configuration and conditions are defined by the standard IEC 60404-2:2008 Magnetic materials - Part 2: Methods of measurement of the magnetic properties of electrical steel sheet and strip by means of an Epstein frameIEC 60404-2:2008 published by International Electrotechnical Commission. An Epstein frame comprises a primary and a secondary winding. The sample under test should be prepared as a set of a number of strips (always a multiple of four) cut from electrical steel sheet or ribbon. Each layer of the sample is double-lapped in corners and weighted down with a force of 1 N (see photo). The power losses are measured by means of a wattmeter method in which the primary current and secondary voltage are used. During the measurement, the Epstein frame behaves as an unloaded transformer. Power loss, Pc, is calculated as: P_c = \\\\frac {N_1}{N_2} \\\\cdot P_m - \\\\frac {\\\\left( 1,111 \\\\cdot \\\\bar{U_2} \\\\right)^2}{R_i} where: N_1~ is the number of turns of primary winding N_2~ is the number of turns of secondary winding P_m~ is the reading of the wattmeter in watts R_i~ is the total resistance of the instruments in the secondary circuit in ohms and \\\\bar{U_2} is the average secondary voltage in volts.

This contrasts with prepositive adjectives, which come before the noun or pronoun, as in noun phrases such as red rose, lucky contestant, and busy bees. In some languages the postpositive placement of adjectives is the normal syntax (as is true in Spanish, for example), but in English it is less usual, largely confined to archaic and poetic uses (as in Spirits supernatural are shy, as opposed to Supernatural spirits are shy), phrases borrowed from Romance languages or Latin (such as heir apparent, aqua regia) and certain fixed grammatical constructions (as in Those anxious to leave soon exited).Rodney Huddleston, English Grammar: An Outline, CUP 1988, p. 109. In syntax, postpositive position is independent of predicative position; a postpositive adjective can occur in either the subject or the predicate of a clause, and any adjective may be a predicate adjective if it follows a linking verb. For example, monsters unseen were said to lurk beyond the moor (subject of clause), but the children trembled in fear of monsters unseen (predicate of clause) and the monsters, if they existed, remained unseen (predicate adjective). Recognizing postpositive adjectives in English is important for determining the correct plural for a compound expression. For example, because martial is a postpositive adjective in the phrase court-martial, the plural is courts- martial, the suffix being attached to the noun rather than the adjective. This pattern holds for most postpositive adjectives, with the few exceptions reflecting overriding linguistic processes such as rebracketing. Occurrence in languages In certain languages, including French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Hebrew, Romanian, Arabic, Persian, Vietnamese, postpositive adjectives are the norm: it is normal for an attributive adjective to follow, rather than precede, the noun it modifies. The following example is from French and Spanish: * le cheval blanc, el caballo blanco, \\"the white horse\\" (literally \\"the horse white\\") In particular instances, however, such languages may also feature prepositive adjectives. In French, certain common adjectives, including grand (\\"big\\"), usually precede the noun, while in Spanish they can be prepositive or postpositve adjectives, in Vietnamese, most adjectives derived from Chinese precede the nouns: * ƒë·∫°i nh√¢n, \\"the great man\\" * le grand cheval, \\"the big horse\\" * el gran caballo, \\"the big horse\\", or el caballo grande, \\"the big horse\\" (literally \\"the horse big\\") When an adjective can appear in both positions, the precise meaning may depend on the position. E.g. in French: * un grand homme - \\"a great man\\" * un homme grand - \\"a tall man\\" Prepositive and postpositive adjectives may occur in the same phrase: * un bon vin blanc, un buen vino blanco, \\"a good white wine\\" In many other languages, including English, German, Russian and Chinese, prepositive adjectives are the norm (attributive adjectives normally come before the nouns they modify), and adjectives appear postpositively only in special situations, if at all. In modern English =General uses= ;Compulsory Adjectives must appear postpositively in English when they qualify almost all compound and some simple indefinite pronouns: some/any/no/every...thing/one/body/where, those (more often between those...ones, this...one, that...one, these...ones) Examples: We need someone strong; those well baked'; Going anywhere nice?; Nothing important happened; Everyone new did not know. All adjectives are used postpositively for qualifying them precisely. The user follows the set formula: :{class=wikitable (optional preposition)(a if singular)nounthisadjective. (or verb/preposition and continuation) } This can be replaced by that or so, or, archaically and in some dialects, yea. Without the preposition the formula is even more intuitive in replies. Examples pointing: \\"Which of the greyhounds do you like?\\" \\"Dogs this big.\\" \\"A dog that weighty would definitely fit the bill.\\" \\"A dog that tall to match my friend's.\\" Examples figuratively: \\"A dog so fast it could win at the track\\". ;Optional Generally to these scenarios: #When it is wished to modify adjectives using an adjective phrase in which the head adjective is not final. Such phrases are common in speaking and in writing save for the reflexive which is a bit stark but common in fiction. Examples: (noun/pronoun)...anxious to leave, proud/full of themselves. Comparative forms are positioned before/after the noun, as in we need a box bigger than......a bigger box than.... Set compounds and near variations. technology easy-to-use; easy-to- use technology; fruit ripe for (the) picking; ripe-for-picking fruit. The postpositive holds more sway for many of the briefest and simplest of such phrases (e.g. in hand). Examples: job in hand; task underway; a case in point #Followed by verbs in the infinitive form for some adjectives, mainly as to size, speed, emotions and probability. Examples: Officers ready to be deployed...Passengers happy to leave...Tourists sad to leave...Team ecstatic with their performance...Solutions likely to work...City large enough...Rocket fast enough; can precede equally if compounded with hyphens. Example: We need numbers of ready-to-deploy officers. ::{class=wikitable Frequently used noun -- more usually in plural formadjectiveinfinitive of verb (i.e. to...) } The optional positions apply to the debatable pronoun and near synonym pairs any way/anyhow, some way/somehow, as well as to (in) no way, in every way. Examples: It was in some way(s) good; it was good in some ways; it was good somehow; it was somehow good. Certain adjectives are used fairly commonly in postpositive position. Present and past participles exhibit this behavior, as in all those entering should ..., one of the men executed was ..., but at will this can be considered to be a verbal rather than adjectival use (a kind of reduced relative clause). Similar behavior is displayed by many adjectives with the suffix -able or -ible (e.g. the best room available, the only decision possible, the worst choice imaginable, the persons liable). Certain other adjectives with a sense similar to those in the foregoing categories are customarily found postpositively (all the people present, the first payment due). Their antonyms (absent and undue) and variations of due (overdue, post- due) can be placed in either position. These two words are among the least varied from the original Anglo-Norman and Old French terms, reflected in modern French, themselves all close to common Latin original forms. A third is used in locating places and in mainly dated use for complex objects: Sweden/the village/town/city proper...operating on the heart proper, it means \\"more narrowly defined\\", or \\"as more closely matches its character\\". Adjectives may undergo a change of meaning when used postpositively. Consider the following examples: #Every visible star is named after a famous astronomer. #Every star visible is named after a famous astronomer. The postpositive in the second sentence is expected to refer to the stars that are visible here and now; that is, it expresses a stage-level predicate. The prepositive in the first sentence may also have that sense, but it may also have an individual-level meaning, referring to an inherent property of the object (the stars that are visible in general). Quite a significant difference in meaning is found with the adjective responsible: #Who should be the responsible people? #Can you direct me to people responsible? Used prepositively, can you direct me to the responsible people?, it strongly connotes \\"dedicated\\" or \\"reliable\\", and by use of the heavily conditional \\"should be\\" it denotes that, otherwise, as in the second sentence, it denotes the far more commonly used meaning in the 21st century of \\"at fault\\" or \\"guilty\\" unless the qualifying word for is added. =Set phrases= There are many set phrases in English which feature postpositive adjectives. They are often loans or loan translations from foreign languages that commonly use postpositives, especially French (many legal terms come from Law French). Some examples appear below: *In culinary arts with foods, drinks, and recipes: spaghetti bolognese; chicken katsu, korma, satay, or supreme; whiskey sour *In Christianity and translations of similar Abrahamic religious concepts: Christ/love/life everlasting, the devil/evil incarnate, God Almighty *In law: actus reus and mens rea, court-martial, fee simple, force majeure, locus classicus, malice aforethought (also malice prepense), persona non grata, *In obscure but irreplaceable phrases: battle royal, body corporate, body politic, corporation sole, fee tail, heir apparent, heir presumptive, knight errant, letters patent,In most places simply called a Patent now letters testamentary, to trip the light fantastic, time immemorial, treasure troveVery widely replaced with \\"treasure\\", \\"treasure\\" under a particular Act or \\"treasure subject to the law of treasure trove\\", originally pronounced closer to trov√©, a basic Old French pronunciation for found. *In professional or honorary titles: bishop emeritus, professor emeritus, attorney general, consul general, governor general, postmaster general, surgeon general, Astronomer Royal, Princess Royal, airman basic, minister plenipotentiary, minister-president, notary public(a redundancy in many jurisdictions but not France, more often referred to simply as notaries and notarial services), poet laureate, president-elect, prime minister-designate, prince regent, sergeant major, queen consort, queen regnant, prince consort, directorate-general, director- general, etc. *In heraldry: dexter and sinister (as in bend dexter, bend sinister), and several referring to attitude, as in eagle displayed, lion passant guardant, griffin rampant, phoenix rising, bird vigilant, etc. *In names of organizations: Alcoholics Anonymous, Amnesty International, ARCHIVE Global, Church Universal and Triumphant, Generation Next, Japan Airlines Domestic, JetBlue, Ruritan National, Situationist International, Socialist International, Verizon Wireless, Virgin Mobile, Weather Underground, Workers United *In hospital emergency codes: Code Amber, Code Black, Code Orange, Code Red *Regnal numbers and other appellations, usually including the definite article before the adjective: Henry the Eighth, Elizabeth the Second, Alexander the Great, Ethelred the Unready, Nero Redivivus etc. Note also the generational titles Junior and Senior used to distinguish namesake parents and children. *Miscellaneous terms: agent provocateur, cause c√©l√®bre, femme fatale, persons unknown, pound sterling, proof positive, language isolate, times/centuries pastFor emphasis, compare \\"the past\\" and \\"past centuries\\" which are less emphatic terms =Set adjectives= Certain individual adjectives, or words of adjectival type, are typically placed after the noun. Their use is not limited to particular noun(s). Those beginning a before an old substantive word can be equally seen as adverbial modifiers (or nouns/pronouns), intuitively expected to be later (see below). * √† gogo -- as in \\"fun and games √† gogo\\" * ablaze -- as in \\"buildings ablaze\\" * abreast -- as in \\"two penguins abreast\\" * akimbo-- as in \\"arms akimbo\\" * aplenty -- as in \\"food aplenty\\" * emeritus -- as in \\"a bishop emeritus\\" * extraordinaire -- as in \\"athlete extraordinaire\\" * galore -- as in \\"roses and tulips galore\\" * incarnate -- as in \\"demons incarnate\\" * junior/Jr. (when used as a name suffix) -- as in \\"Martin Luther King, Jr.\\" * manqu√©/manqu√©e -- as in \\"a hero manqu√©\\" * regnant -- as in \\"the queen regnant\\" * redivivus -- as in \\"Emperor Nero redivivus\\" * redux -- as in \\"the Cold War redux\\" * senior/Sr. or (when used as a name suffix) -- as in \\"Barack Obama, Sr.\\" =Archaic and poetic usage= Phrases with postpositive adjectives are sometimes used with archaic effect, as in things forgotten, words unspoken, dreams believed. Phrases which reverse the normal word order are quite common in poetry, usually to fit the meter or rhyme, as with \\"fiddlers three\\" (from Old King Cole) or \\"forest primeval\\" (from Evangeline), though word order was less important in Early Modern English and earlier forms of English. Similar examples exist for possessive adjectives, as in \\"O Mistress Mine\\" (a song in Act II, Scene 3 of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night). =Titles of works= Titles of books, films, poems, songs, etc. commonly feature nouns followed by postpositive adjectives. These are often present or past participles (see above), but other types of adjectives sometimes occur. Examples: Apocalypse Now Redux, \\"Bad Moon Rising\\", Body Electric, Brideshead Revisited, Chicken Little, Chronicle of a Death Foretold, A Dream Deferred, Hannibal Rising, Hercules Unchained, House Beautiful, Jupiter Ascending, The Life Aquatic, A Love Supreme, The Matrix Reloaded, Monsters Unleashed, Orpheus Descending, Paradise Lost, Paradise Regained, Prometheus Unbound, \\"The Road Not Taken\\", Sonic Unleashed, To a God Unknown, Tarzan Triumphant, Time Remembered, The World Unseen, Enemy Mine. =Other postpositive noun modifiers= Nouns may have other modifiers besides adjectives. Some kinds of modifiers tend to precede the noun, while others tend to come after. Determiners (including articles, possessives, demonstratives, etc.) come before the noun. Noun adjuncts (nouns qualifying another noun) also generally come before the nouns they modify: in a phrase like book club, the adjunct (modifier) book comes before the head (modified noun) club. By contrast, prepositional phrases, adverbs of location, etc., as well as relative clauses, come after the nouns they modify: the elephant in the room; all the people here; the woman to whom you spoke. (These remarks apply to English syntax; other languages may use different word order. In Chinese, for example, virtually all modifiers come before the noun, whereas in the Khmer language they follow the noun.) Sometimes a noun with a postpositive modifier comes to form a set phrase, similar in some ways to the set phrases with postpositive adjectives referred to above (in that, for example, the plural ending will normally attach to the noun, rather than at the end of the phrase). Some such phrases include: * With a noun followed by a prepositional phrase: mother-in-law, etc.; editor-in-chief, right of way, president pro tempore (where pro tempore is a Latin prepositional phrase), fish filet deluxe (where de luxe is a French prepositional phrase) *With an infinitive verb or a verb phrase: father-to-be, bride-to-be, etc.; Johnny-come-lately *With an adverbial particle from a phrasal verb: passer-by, hanger-on In some phrases, a noun adjunct appears postpositively (rather than in the usual prepositive position). Examples include Knights Hospitaller, Knights Templar, man Friday (or girl Friday, etc.), airman first class (also private first class, sergeant first class), as well as many names of foods and dishes, such as Bananas Foster, beef Wellington, broccoli raab, Cherries Jubilee, Chicken Tetrazzini, Cr√™pe Suzette, Eggs Benedict, Oysters Rockefeller, peach Melba, steak tartare, and duck a l'orange. Identifying numbers (with or without the word number), and sometimes letters, appear after the noun in many contexts. Examples are Catch-22; warrant officer one, chief warrant officer two, etc.; Beethoven's Symphony No. 9; Call of Duty Three, Rocky Four, Shrek the Third, Generation Y. (For appellations such as \\"Henry the Fourth\\", often written \\"Henry IV\\", see above.) Other common cases where modifiers follow a head noun include: *Phrases like the Brothers Grimm and the Sisters Rosensweig (although in ordinary cases the phrasing \\"the Brown brothers\\" is more common) *Names of military operations and equivalent, such as Operation Barbarossa, Operation Desert Storm, etc. *Names of scientific projects and the like, such as Project Daedalus, Project Echo =Plurals of expressions with postpositives= In the plural forms of expressions with postpositive adjectives or other postpositive modifiers, the pluralizing morpheme (most commonly the suffix -s or -es) is added after the noun, rather than after the entire phrase. For instance, the plural form of town proper is towns proper, that of battle royal is battles royal, that of attorney general is attorneys general, that of bride-to-be is brides-to-be, and that of passer-by is passers-by. See also Plurals of French compounds. With some such expressions, there is a tendency (by way of regularization) to add the plural suffix to the end of the whole expression. This is usually regarded by prescriptive grammarians as an error. Examples are *queen consorts (where queens consort is considered the correct form) and *court-martials (where the accepted plural is courts-martial, although court- martials can be used as a third person present tense verb form). This rule does not necessarily apply to phrases with postpositives that have been rigidly fixed into names and titles. For example, an English speaker might say \\"Were there two separate Weather Undergrounds by the 1970s, or just one single organization?\\". Other phrases remain as they are because they intrinsically use a plural construction (and have no singular form), such as eggs Benedict, nachos supreme, Brothers Grimm, Workers United.

Shawish as a surname is also widely used throughout the world. Other families with the Shawish surname originated from Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Iraq, Egypt, Libya, Tunisia and Morocco. The Shawish surname has several variations in languages other than Arabic. Written Arabic language frequently omits vowels, therefore the surname is often spelled using only plain Arabic alphabet, literally as \\"Shawesh\\". \\"Al-\\" or \\"El\\", meaning \\"family of\\" or \\"the\\" in Arabic, is often used as a prefix to names in formal identifications. English or other languages translations of the surname therefore vary, some common versions include:(Al) Shawish; Shawish; (El) Shawesh; Shaweesh Origin Origin and migration of Shawish family. Shawish Neighbourhood, Old City of Jerusalem. Several Islamic historians assert that the Shawish family is a descendant of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. This claim is based on verifiable historical documents describing the link through \\"twenty four men\\" (generations) between Muhammad and Ustaz Mohammad Zuhayr Al- Shawish (see below) The Hashemi clan, to which Muhammad belonged, were the ancestors of Al-Husayni clan through Husayn ibn Ali, Muhammad's grandson, whose members migrated from Mecca to neighbouring countries in the Levant region to fight the crusaders. In the 13th century after Saladin victory over the crusaders, Al-Husayni clan settled in Jerusalem, expanded to thousands of members and gained power and influence. During the periods of Ottoman Empire and British Mandate of Palestine, and due to significant historical and political events in Jerusalem, some Al-Husayni individuals adopted new surnames drawn from their professions. Within the Shawish family, it is widely believed that the name Shawish (meaning Police or Army Sergeant) originated from a policeman in the Old City of Jerusalem at that time, around the end of the 19th century. An early record of the surname Shawish was in a British Newspaper ‚ÄúThe New Age‚Äù article in 1910. The article discussed several current affairs in Egypt and made reference to Sheykh Abdul Aziz Shawish -- or, as Egyptians pronounce it, Gawish as in Arabic his name is written -- editor of ‚ÄùAl Lewa'‚Äù newspaper at that time.Pickthall, Marmaduke, \\"The Situation in Egypt\\". A Reply to Duse Mohamed. The New Age. Vol. VII. No. 9. JUNE 30, 1910. London. UK Migration The Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories and the city of Jerusalem following the 1967 Six-Day War forced some family members to immigrate to neighbouring countries, primarily to Amman, the Jordanian capital. Modern-day At present the remaining Shawish family is one of the largest pre-1948 Palestinian families in the Old City of Jerusalem. In addition to the main bases of Jerusalem and Jordan, where the family has a very strong presence, many of the younger members of the family have emigrated for economic and educational reasons and currently reside in the United States, UAE, and smaller in numbers in Syria, Lebanon, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, Sudan, Brazil, Mexico, UK, Australia and many other countries. Occupation Traditionally tradesmen and small business owners, currently many of the family members run their own small retail businesses in Jerusalem, Jordan, and to lesser extent in other countries. It is common to see signs above small shops saying ‚ÄúAl-Shawish‚Äù in the Old City of Jerusalem or downtown Amman. Some members of Shawish family have also entered mid-market professions; IT, Finance, Management, Sales and Marketing, Education and other Trades. The family is not known to have many craftsmen, civil servants, police or army personnel.

Depending on the electrode half-reaction, one can distinguish two types of partial current: * cathodic partial current Ic (called also cathodic current): is the flow of electrons from the electrode surface to a species in solution; * anodic partial current Ia (called also anodic current): is the flow of electrons into the electrode from a species in solution. The cathodic and anodic partial currents are defined by IUPAC. The partial current densities (ic and ia) are the ratios of partial currents respect to the electrode areas (Ac and Aa): :ic = Ic/Ac :ia = Ia/Aa The sum of the cathodic partial current density ic (positive) and the anodic partial current density ia (negative) gives the net current density i:Electrochemistry Dictionary and Encyclopedia :i = ic \\\\+ ia In the case of the cathodic partial current density being equal to the anodic partial current density (for example, in a corrosion processB.

Its governor is the constitutional head and its chief minister is the democratically elected head of the state. The state government maintains its capital at Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum) and is seated at the Kerala Government Secretariat or the Hajur Kutcheri. The Government of Kerala was formed on 1 November 1956, after merging of the state of Travancore-Cochin with the Malabar district of the Madras state as part of States Reorganisation Act, 1956.  Government and administration  = Governor = The governor is appointed by the President for a term of five years. The executive and legislative powers lie with the Chief Minister and his council of ministers, who are appointed by the governor. The governors of the states and territories of India have similar powers and functions at the state level as that of the president of India at the national level. Only Indian citizens above 35 years of age are eligible for appointment. Governors discharge all constitutional functions, such as the appointment of the chief minister, sending reports to the president about failure of constitutional machinery in a state, or with respect to issues relating to the assent to a bill passed by legislature, exercise or their own opinion. Thumbnail map of India with Kerala highlighted. Arif Mohammad Khan is the present governor. The governor enjoys many different types of powers: *Executive powers related to administration, appointments, and removals *Legislative powers related to lawmaking and the state legislature *Discretionary powers to be carried out according to the discretion of the governor = Legislature = The state assembly building in Thiruvananthapuram. The legislature comprises the governor and the legislative assembly, which is the highest political organ in the state. The governor has the power to summon the assembly or to close the same. All members of the legislative assembly are directly elected, normally once in every five years by the eligible voters who are above 18 years of age. The current assembly consists of 140 elected members and one member nominated by the governor from the Anglo-Indian community. The elected members select one of its own members as its chairman who is called the speaker. The speaker is assisted by the deputy speaker who is also elected by the members. The conduct of a meeting in the house is the responsibility of the speaker. The main function of the assembly is to pass laws and rules. Every bill passed by the house has to be finally approved by the governor before it becomes applicable. The normal term of the legislative assembly is five years from the date appointed for its first meeting. But while a proclamation of state of emergency is in operation, the said period will be extended by Parliament by Laws for a period not exceeding one year at a time. = Judiciary = High Court of Kerala in Kochi The High Court of Kerala is the apex court for the state; it also hears cases from the Union Territory of Lakshadweep. It is a court of record and has all the powers of such a court including the authority to punish an individual for contempt of court. Like all other High Courts of India, this court also consists of a chief justice and other judges who are appointed by the president of India. At present, the sanctioned judge strength of the High Court of Kerala is 27 permanent judges including the chief justice and two additional judges. Every judge including the chief justice is appointed by the president of India by warrant under his hand and seal. Every permanent and additional judge continues in office until the age of 62. The High Court of Kerala is in Kochi and there are courts in every district centers and some municipal centers. =Executive= Government Secretariat Complex in Thiruvananthapuram, which houses offices of ministers and secretaries Like in other Indian states, the executive arm of the state is responsible for the day-to-day management of the state. It consists of the governor, the chief minister and the Council of Ministers. The chief minister and the council of ministers also have been appointed by the governor. The governor summons prorogues and dissolves the legislature. He can close the legislative assembly on the recommendation of the chief minister. Judiciary has been separated from the executive in Kerala like other Indian states.  Chief Minister  The executive authority is headed by the Chief Minister of Kerala, who is the de facto head of state and is vested with most of the executive powers; the Legislative Assembly's majority party leader is appointed to this position by the Governor. The present Chief Minister is Pinarayi Vijayan, who took office on 25 May 2016. Generally, the winning party decides the chief minister. In many cases, the party focuses a chief ministerial candidate during the election.  Council of Ministers  The Council of Ministers, which answers to the Legislative Assembly, has its members appointed by the Governor; the appointments receive input from the Chief Minister. They are collectively responsible to the legislative assembly of the State. Generally, the winning party and its chief minister chooses the ministers list and submit the list for the Governor's approval.  Administrative divisions  Kerala State has been divided into 14 districts, 27 revenue divisions, 14 district panchayats, 75 taluks, 152 CD blocks, 1453 revenue villages, 978 Gram panchayats, 6 corporations and 60 municipalities. The business of the state government is transacted through the various secretariat departments based on the rules of business. Each department consists of secretary to the government, who is the official head of the department and such other under secretaries, junior secretaries, officers, and staffs subordinate to him/her. The Chief secretary superintending control over the whole secretariat and staff attached to the ministers. The department is further divided into sections, each of which is under the charge of a section officer. Apart from these sections, dealing with the subjects allotted to them, there are other offices sections, assigned with specific duties. When there is more than one secretary in a department, there shall be a clear separation of work. =Departments= * Finance Department * Department of Registration (Kerala) * Forests and Wildlife Department * I&PRD; Department * NORKA Department * Public Works Department * Tourism Department * Revenue Department * Civil Supplies Department * Industries Department * Education Department * Agricultural Department * Law Department * Water Resources Department * Health Services Department * Animal Husbandry * Fisheries & Ports * Electronics & Information Technology * Ayush * Co-operation * Home * Health and Family Welfare * Norka * Housing * Information & Public Relations * Coastal Shipping and Inland Navigation * Social Justice Department * Local Self-Government Department * Taxes * Transport * Vigilance * Water Resources * Western Ghats Cell * Power * Public Works Department * SC/ST Development * Science & Technology * Planning & Economic Affairs  State insignias  The Kerala State Emblem is a derivative version of the royal coat of arms of the Kingdom of Travancore. The state emblem symbolises two elephants guarding the Imperial Shanku, or conch, in its imperial crest. This crest was the insignia of Lord Sree Padmanabha (a form of Lord Vishnu) - the national deity of Travancore. Shanku was considered one of the common emblems of a majority of the Kerala feudal kingdoms. The Kingdom of Cochin and Zamorin's Malabar also had conch as state emblems. When the kingdoms of Cochin and Travancore merged in 1949, for a brief period, the crest carried a wheel or chakra in the centre with Shanku on top of it. With the accession of Malabar into Travancore-Cochin, the state of Kerala was formed in 1957. During this time, the royal coat of arms of the Travancore kingdom was modified by placing the \\"Lion Capital of Ashoka\\" on top of the imperial conch. The Travancore Royal Family uses the erstwhile Royal Coat of Arms of Travancore today, whereas Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple of Trivandrum uses only the imperial conch crest as its coat of arms. The state animal of Kerala is the elephant, and the government emblem has two elephants in it. The state bird is the great Indian hornbill (ML:‡¥Æ‡¥≤‡¥Æ‡µç‡¥™‡µÅ‡¥¥‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ï‡¥ø ‡¥µ‡µá‡¥¥‡¥æ‡¥Æ‡µç‡¥™‡¥≤‡µç‚Äç). The state flower is the golden shower (ML:‡¥ï‡¥£‡¥ø‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ï‡µä‡¥®‡µç‡¥®), and the state tree is the coconut. The state fish is the pearlspot or karimeen (‡¥ï‡¥∞‡¥ø‡¥Æ‡µÄ‡¥®‡µç‚Äç‚Äå).  Elections  Elections to the state assembly are held every five years. Elections are generally held for Parliament, State assembly and regional panchayats. Due to the large numbers of eligible voters, over 21 million, elections are usually held on several dates. Like all other Indian states, the minimum age of registration of a voter is 18 years.  Politics  Kerala has a unique position in India as one of the most politicised states. It has the nation's largest politically aware population, which actively participates in state politics. Politics in Kerala is dominated by two political fronts: the Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) and the Indian National Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) since late 1970s. These two coalitions have alternated in power since 1982. According to the 2016 Kerala Legislative Assembly election, the LDF has a majority in the state assembly (92/140). The political alliance has strongly stabilised and, with rare exceptions, most of the coalition partners maintain loyalty to the alliance. As a result of this, power has alternated between these two fronts since 1979. In terms of individual parties, the state has strong leanings towards socialism and thus Communist parties have made strong inroads in Kerala. The Malabar region, particularly Kannur and Palakkad, are considered the heartland of the Communist parties. The Kollam and Alapuzha districts, where trade unions have a strong presence, are generally inclined to Left parties, though several times the UDF has won. The CPI(M) led LDF did a clean sweep of 11‚Äì0 over UDF and NDA in Kollam district during 2016 Local body election. The largest Communist party is the CPIM and the second largest is the CPI. The Indian National Congress, which leads the UDF coalition, has had a very strong presence in Kerala since pre-Independence days. The Congress party has great popularity in the Thrissur, Ernakulam, Kottayam, Pathanamthitta and Thiruvananthapuram regions, whereas it has a strong influence in some parts of Idukki regions. The Bharathiya Janata Party (the Party that currently leads the Government of India) is also active in Kerala, but is not part of either coalition. It does not have any elected Parliament, but has one Legislative Assembly member and selected members in all the Corporations, several Municipal Councils and a large number of Local Panchayats. The party enjoys popularity in the districts of Thiruvananthapuram and Kasaragod Other popular regional parties are: * The Kerala Congress, which has more than four denominations after breaking away from the original party. It has strong influence among settlement populations in hilly regions. The various Kerala Congress denominations are primarily patronized by the Syrian Christian community and Nair populations, mostly in Central Travancore areas like Kottayam, Idukki and Pathanamthitta. Today, most of Kerala Congress parties are with the UDF. * The Indian Union Muslim League is a powerful pro- Muslim community-oriented party, which was started as the Muslim League prior to Independence, yet decided to transfer their allegiance to the Indian Union after Independence, when the original Muslim League went to Pakistan. The IUML-Kerala unit is the only Muslim League group to declare its allegiance and loyalty to India and hence become a state party in post-Independence India. The party has strongholds mostly in Muslim-dominated districts like Kozhikode, Malappuram and Kasargod. They form the second largest party within the UDF. * Socialist groups, consisting of several small fragmented parties like the NCP, SJD-S, JDS, and Congress-S, are mainly centre-left socialist parties having very limited influence in a few pocket areas. Most of the socialist groups are with the LDF, though in a few instances, some of them changed their loyalties to the UDF. * Communist parties consist of various groups which have broken away from the CPIM. They are mostly centre-left parties, though a few are extreme-left. While a few centre-left parties like the RSP have joined with the UDF, those that broke away from the CPIM, like the CMP and JSS, led by erstwhile CPIM veterans who were expelled from CPIM, have joined with the UDF. * The Bharath Dharma Jana Sena or BDJS is a new political party formed in 2015 led by Thushar Vellapally. The party's primary vote base is among Ezhava and thiyya community. It is politically and ideologically aligned towards the BJP and is a part of National Democratic Alliance.

Fitted with a mixed armament of and guns, the ships were designed for service with the fleet. Completed in 1904, Gloire joined her sister ships in the Northern Squadron (), usually serving as a flagship. She participated in the French bombardment of Casablanca, Morocco, in 1907, and was briefly assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron () in 1910‚Äì1911. Gloire became a training ship in late 1913. When World War I began in August 1914, she was assigned to patrol the English Channel to enforce the blockade of Germany and remained on that duty into 1916. The cruiser was briefly deployed to French West Africa to search for German commerce raiders later that year before she was transferred to the French West Indies for several months. Increased commerce raiding activity in early 1917 prompted a permanent deployment to the West Indies to escort convoys as part of the Atlantic Division (). Gloire remained there for at least a year after the war ended in November 1918 before she returned home to be placed in reserve. The ship was stricken in 1922 and sold for scrap the following year. Design and description Right elevation and plan of the Gloire-class armored cruisers The Gloire-class ships were designed by Emile Bertin as enlarged and improved versions of the preceding . The ships measured overall, with a beam of and a draft of . They displaced .Jordan & Caresse, p. 123 Their crew numbered 25 officers and 590 enlisted men. The sisters' propulsion machinery consisted of three vertical triple-expansion steam engines, each driving a single propeller shaft, using steam provided by water- tube boilers, but the types of machinery differed between them. Gloire had three-cylinder engines fed by 28 Niclausse boilers that were designed to produce a total of intended to give her a maximum speed of . During her sea trials on 19 January 1904, the ship reached from . The cruisers carried enough coal to give them a range of at a speed of .Jordan & Caresse, pp. 123, 131 =Armament and armor= The forward gun turret with the conning tower and bridge behind it The main battery of the Gloire class consisted of two quick- firing (QF) 194 mm Mod√®le 1893‚Äì1896 guns mounted in single-gun turrets fore and aft of the superstructure. Their secondary armament comprised eight QF 164.7 mm Mod√®le 1893‚Äì1896 guns and six QF Canon de Mod√®le de 1893 guns. Half of the 164.7 mm guns were in two singe-gun wing turrets on each broadside and all of the remaining guns were on single mounts in casemates in the hull.Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 305 For defense against torpedo boats, they carried eighteen and four Hotchkiss guns, all of which were in single mounts. The sisters were also armed with five torpedo tubes, of which two were submerged and three above water. Two of these were on each broadside and the fifth tube was in the stern. All of the above-water tubes were on pivot mounts. The ships varied in the number of naval mines that they could carry and Gloire was fitted with storage for 12.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 125‚Äì126 The Gloire class were the first French armored cruisers to have their waterline armored belt made from Harvey face-hardened armor plates. The belt ranged in thickness from . Because of manufacturing limitations, the thinner end plates were nickel steel. Behind the belt was a cofferdam, backed by a longitudinal watertight bulkhead. The upper armored deck met the top of the belt and had a total thickness of while the lower armored deck curved down to meet the bottom of the belt and had a uniform thickness of .Jordan & Caresse, pp. 127‚Äì128 The main-gun turrets were protected by of Harvey armor, but their barbettes used plates of ordinary steel. The face and sides of the secondary turrets were thick and the plates protecting their barbettes were thick. The casemates protecting the 100-millimeter guns also had a thickness of 102 millimeters. The face and sides of the conning tower were 174 millimeters thick.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 128‚Äì130 Construction and career A postcard showing Gloire bombarding Casablanca, Morocco, in 1907 Gloire, named after Glory,Silverstone, pp. 99 was authorized in the 1896 Naval Program and was ordered from the Arsenal de Lorient on 17 September 1898. The ship was laid down on 5 September 1899, launched on 27 June 1900, and completed on 28 April 1904.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 115, 117‚Äì118 The cost of her construction was 22,081,725 francs. The ship was assigned as the flagship of Rear Admiral () Joseph Bugard, commander of the 1st Cruiser Division () of the Northern Squadron. Gloire had been relieved as flagship by 4 August 1905.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 131, 213 Together with her sisters and , Gloire escorted the remains of John Paul Jones from France to Annapolis, Maryland, in April 1906 and then went on to visit New York City. The 2nd Cruiser Division had been formed by January 1907 and Gloire was the division's flagship.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 210 On 7‚Äì8 August the ship participated in the bombardment of Casablanca, the first step in the French conquest of Morocco.Roche, p. 234 By October 1907 she was the flagship of Rear Admiral Joseph-Alphonse Philibert. After a reorganization that saw the Mediterranean Squadron redesignated as the 1st Squadron (), Gloire and her sisters and were assigned to the 2nd Light Division ( (DL)) of the 1st Squadron by June 1910. As more modern armored cruisers entered service, they were concentrated in the Mediterranean and Gloire (now the divisional flagship), Amiral Aube and Cond√© were reunited by January 1911 in the Cruiser Division of the 2nd Squadron, as the Northern Squadron had been redesignated.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 133, 210‚Äì211 In March the sisters visited New York City. When the s began entering service in August, the French Navy reorganized yet again with the 2nd Squadron renumbered as the 3rd and the Cruiser Division was renamed as the 3rd DL by 4 September. Gloire was now the flagship of Rear Admiral Charles-Eug√®ne Favereau. The ship participated in the fleet review by the President of France, Armand Falli√®res, off Toulon that day. While conducting gunnery training on 20 September, a propellant charge exploded prematurely in one of her 194 mm gun turrets that killed nine and badly wounded another five crewmen. A memorial for the dead was conducted aboard the cruiser five days later. After the Agadir Crisis of 1911, the French and British governments agreed in 1912 that the Royal Navy would defend the northern French coast and the French would concentrate their fleet in the Mediterranean and defend British interests there. The French forces left in the north were consolidated into the 2nd Light Squadron with the 3rd DL redesignated as the 1st Cruiser Squadron. The ship was reassigned to the Atlantic Training Division () by 10 November 1913 where she served as the flagship of Rear Admiral Auguste-Georges Bouxin.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 133, 211, 214‚Äì215 =World War I= As tensions rose during the July Crisis of 1914, Gloire and the other training cruisers were reactivated and assigned to the 2nd Light Division of the 2nd Light Squadron () which was tasked to defend the English Channel in conjunction with the British. The 2nd DL was on station in the western end of the Channel by 4 August, where they were tasked to intercept German shipping and provide distant cover to the smaller ships escorting the transports conveying the British Expeditionary Force to France. On 27 October the French patrols in the Channel were reorganized with Rear Admiral Fran√ßois le Canellier aboard Gloire in control of the smaller cruisers now conducting the patrols.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 223‚Äì225 The successes of German merchant raiders like in 1916 caused the Allies to transfer cruisers to the Atlantic to protect their shipping. Gloire, was temporarily assigned to the 3rd DL when she was sent to Dakar, French West Africa, in February, but returned two months later. After another reorganization in May, Gloire and all of her sisters were assigned to the 3rd DL which was tasked with patrolling the West Indies in search of German commerce raiders. Together with Amiral Aube, Gloire departed Brest on 20 May, bound for Fort-de-France in the colony of Martinique to rendezvous with Marseillaise and Cond√© which were already there. The armored cruisers were relieved by the 4th DL in September. M√∂we and two other raiders began cruises in late 1916. Gloire left Brest in an unsuccessful attempt to intercept M√∂we in late December off Halifax and returned on 17 January 1917. Not long afterwards she returned to the West Indies. The 3rd DL was disbanded on 18 May and the remaining cruisers in the West Indies were assigned to the 4th DL which was redesignated as the Atlantic and Antilles Division () on 1 June with Gloire as its flagship.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 242, 245 The division was tasked with escorting convoys bound for Europe from Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands beginning on 15 February 1918.Jordan & Caresse, p. 248 In May the cruiser collided with the American ocean liner Silverstone, p. 100 and was sent back to France for repairs. Gloire returned to the West Indies and became flagship again when the division was renamed the Atlantic Division on 25 June. The convoy escort responsibilities were reorganized on 7 July with the French covering convoys from New York City to the Bay of Biscay. She was still assigned to the division when the war ended on 11 November and she escorted the ocean liner bringing General John Pershing back to the United States on 1 September 1919. The ship was subsequently placed in reserve before she was stricken from the naval register on 7 July 1922 and was sold for scrap in 1923.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 248‚Äì249, 253, 257 Notes References  * Further reading *Marcophilie Daniel: D√©barquement √† Casablanca en 1907 Category:1900 ships Category:Gloire-class cruisers ","title":"French cruiser Gloire (1900)"},{"id":"13666772","text":"Iwakuni Castle The ' was a Japanese domain of the Edo period, located in Su≈ç Province (the south of present-day Yamaguchi Prefecture).

After implantation, the \\"insect cyborgs\\" could be controlled by sending electrical impulses to their muscles. The primary application is surveillance. The project was created with the ultimate goal of delivering an insect within 5 meters of a target located 100 meters away from its starting point.
