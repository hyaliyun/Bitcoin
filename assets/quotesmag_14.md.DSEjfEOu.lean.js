The operator, Veolia Transport Cannes is responsible for operating the Bus Azur buses for SITP, grouping the communes of Cannes, le Cannet et Mandelieu-la-Napoule. History The city of Cannes was, until 1933, served by an urban tramway system, the Tramway de Cannes, as well as an inter-urban tramway, the Tramway de Nice et du Littoral until 1953. The first bus services within Cannes and between Cannes and le Cannet began in 1936. Cannes bus company operated four lines: *Cannes to le Cannet *Cannes to Rocheville *Cannes to Cannes-la-Bocca *Cannes to la Croisette Each of the lines were divided in two fare zones. In 1954, the concession for operation of buses in Cannes was given to Société des Transports Urbains de Cannes by the Syndicat Intercommunal des Transports Publics for twenty years. Several lines were created during the 1960s, linking Cannes to la Californie, Cannes and le Cannet via République and Cannes to l'Aubarède. Lines were divided into four fare zones. In 1968, severe strikes forced the company to reduce its staff presence on buses to one. The STUC's concession was extended by ten years in 1974 thanks to a grant to the STIP. The company adopted a new ticketing system, using magnetic strip cards. Lines were grouped into two global fare zones in replacement of the four per line. Service was increased with the purchase of more rolling stock. Within two years, stock and staff numbers doubled. In 1978, the STUC purchased a diesel multiple unit X 94630 for use on the Cannes-Ranguin railway line. Service was eleven minutes in length and bus ticketing used. The concession was once more extended, for five years, in 1984, with further bus purchases and the repainting of the X 94630 into the line's colours. rail services ended in 1995 due to loss of revenue. On 5 November 1996, CGFTE Cannes signed a contract delegating services. In 2004, Bus Azur introduced double-decker buses on its line 8 quai Laubeuf-La Croisette-Palm Beach.

The station was situated between Thorne and Medge Hall. History The South Yorkshire Railway (SYR) had a small system connecting Sheffield with and some neighbouring towns; in 1855 it reached Thorne. An eastwards extension from Thorne to , parallel to the Keadby Canal (which was owned by the SYR), was commenced in December 1858, and opened on 10 September 1859. Originally there was only one intermediate station, at , but others were soon opened, including one at Maud's Bridge in October 1859. Only a couple of miles to the east the line crosses the county boundary, leaving Yorkshire and entering Lincolnshire. It was at Maud's Bridge that the new 'straightened' track from Thorne South, opened in 1864, rejoined the original route along the canal.

He represented Warwick South Central as a Member of Parliament from 1993 to 2010. Born in Bermuda, Brown is a graduate of Howard University and the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). In 1966 he represented Bermuda at the Commonwealth Games in Jamaica. Premier Brown was elected leader of the ruling Progressive Labour Party on 30 October 2006, defeating incumbent leader and Premier William Alexander Scott, at a PLP delegates conference. Brown won the vote 107 – 76. He was the seventh leader of the Progressive Labour Party and the third leader of that party since winning the 1998 general election. Under his leadership, Brown pledged to take Bermuda to the next level and to \\"lead Bermuda to greater health, happiness and prosperity for all of its people\\". In the 2007 General Election the PLP defeated the United Bermuda Party for the third election in a row. Brown retired in October 2010. Since leaving office, Brown has returned to his medical practice as founder and Executive Chairman of Bermuda HealthCare Services and Brown-Darrell Clinic. Early life Brown was born in Bermuda to Ewart Sr. and Helene Brown of Flatts. His mother was a member of parliament for the United Bermuda Party (UBP), as was his aunt, Gloria Juanita McPhee, who became Bermuda's first female cabinet minister. He attended the public Central School (today known as Victor Scott Primary) in Pembroke until the age of 11, after which he attended Berkeley Institute. He eventually was sent by his parents to live with an aunt in Jamaica, where he excelled in sports, particularly cricket and track and field, while attending St Jago High School in Spanish Town, eventually representing that school in the 440-yard dash. Brown's sporting achievements led him to university in the United States of America. The University of Illinois offered him a scholarship, but Brown chose instead to attend Howard University, a historically black university in Washington, D.C. In 1966, he represented Bermuda at the Commonwealth Games, reaching the second round of the 400-yard dash. As a student leader, he was a vocal figure during the Washington riots, speaking alongside campus activists and Black Panther leaders such as Stokely Carmichael. In 1968, Brown led a coalition of Howard University campus political organizations in a successful five-day takeover of the school's administration building. It was the first all-black seizure of a college administration building in the United States. Brown decided to continue his education and become a doctor. He earned an M.D. from Howard's College of Medicine, and moved to Los Angeles to pursue a Master of Public Health from the University of California. His key areas of study included family medicine, population control and international health. Brown remained in Los Angeles, acquiring US citizenship and opening a medical practice, the Vermont Century Medical Clinic, in 1974. In 1974 he became the first qualified doctor in 50 years to be turned down for a Bermuda Medical license to practice after failing the registration exam. Brown alleged that the powers that be deliberately gave him a failing grade for political reasons. He eventually received his license to practice in 1988, and set up Bermuda Healthcare Services in 1990, returning to the island permanently in 1993. Brown became a director for the Marcus Garvey School, a K-8 school in Los Angeles, which named him Humanitarian of the Year in 1991. Brown has served as a trustee of both Howard University and Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science, and Assistant Professor of Drew University's Department of Family Practice. Brown is a former member of the Board of Directors of Marina Hills Hospital in Los Angeles, California; a former member of the California State Commission on Maternal, Child and Adolescent Health; and a founding Commissioner of the Board of Prevention Commissioners for South Central Los Angeles Regional Centre for Development Disabilities. He was a founder and Chairman of the Board of Directors for Western Park Hospital in Los Angeles, California and served as Director of Quality Assurance for the Los Angeles Doctor's Hospital; Chairman of the Minority Group Affairs of the Student American Medical Association and as a Coordinator of the Summer Health Task Force of the National Urban Coalition in Washington D.C.; as Chairman of the Utilization Review Committee, West Adams Hospital, Los Angeles, California; and as Secretary of the Charles R Drew Medical Society in Los Angeles. Honors Brown has been honored for his service to medicine and for his humanitarian and philanthropic efforts. He was recognized twice by Howard University's College of Medicine for distinguished service to the college. He received the Physicians Recognition Award in 1977 from the American Medical Association; the Grassroots Health Award from the Sons of Watts California in 1979; the Dubois Academic Institute's Community Leadership Award in 1982; the Pacesetter Award from the NAACP in 1984; Humanitarian of the Year Award from the Marcus Garvey School in Los Angeles in 1991; and in 1993, the Scroll Award from the Union of American Physicians and Dentists. Political life At the urging of then-PLP leader L. F. Wade, Brown returned to Bermuda and became involved in local politics in 1993 to run as a candidate for the Opposition Progressive Labour Party. That year, he ran as a PLP candidate for one of the two Warwick West constituency's seats in the House of Assembly, facing the two incumbent UBP members of parliament: Quinton Edness and Sir John Sharpe, the former Premier. Brown finished only two votes behind Edness, unseating Sharpe by 14 votes. In Opposition, Brown first served as Shadow Minister for Youth and Sports and in 1995 became Shadow Minister for Human Affairs. In the following general election in 1998, Brown again won one of the Warwick West seats, and was joined by El James during the PLP's historic victory over the UBP ending 30 years of United Bermuda Party rule. Brown was appointed the PLP's first Minister of Transport by Premier Jennifer Smith. =Minister of Transport= As Minister of Transport, Brown oversaw the public bus system, taxis, marine ports and ferries, vehicle licensing, and aviation. He introduced a number of reforms, including the completion of the oppositions plan for the replacement of the island's obsolescent ferries with faster, 205-seat catamarans, the Serenity and the Resolute, in 2002. In May of that year, he clashed with the taxi industry over his proposed legislation to require a GPS-based central despatching system, which was eventually passed into law four years later. Air arrivals at Bermuda International Airport increased by 15 percent between 2003-2007, largely due to the introduction of low cost airline service in 2004, reversing a twenty-year decline from the 1980s. While James G. Howes was the general manager, the Bermuda International Airport was recognized as the best in the North American region for overall passenger satisfaction for both 2002 and 2003, as well as ninth in the world in 2002, for which the Brown threw a party for all of the airport employees and their families. In October 2008, however, the Department of Statistics announced that visitor arrivals had plunged from the previous year to their second lowest level since 1980, saying \\"Air arrivals during the second quarter of 2008 [April–June] fell 10 percent compared to the same quarter last year... The number of visitors stood at 89,642 persons, representing the second lowest second quarter visitor total since 1980.\\" Cruise ship calls also declined from 181 in 2007, to 122 in 2008. In mid-2008, Brown put additional tourism promotional emphasis in the New York market (Bermuda's largest), resulting in a 27% increase in New York arrivals for December 2008 compared to December 2007, officials said. Overall, December 2008 arrivals were almost 7% higher than December 2007. The government projected 300,000 cruise visitors in 2009. In 2004, Brown clashed with the US Consulate over what was alleged to be a \\"gross violation\\" of security at the Bermuda International Airport, when he was said to have avoided security screening procedures. Brown denied the claim, and criticized the consulate for making the issue public. Following the PLP's second general election victory on 23 July 2003, Brown and ten PLP MPs refused to support PLP Leader Jennifer Smith as premier. She resigned on 28 July 2003, and following a special leadership conference of the PLP, William Alexander Scott was elected as leader of the party and premier. Brown was elected as Deputy Leader of Party and Deputy Premier of Bermuda. Responding to criticism that the leadership challenge was launched after the voters had already gone to the polls, Brown responded, \\"We had to mislead you.\\" A compromise between the factions of the party led to Smith being replaced by William Alexander Scott and Brown being named Deputy Premier, and later adding the Ministry of Tourism to his portfolio. =Premier= Brown with former US President George W. Bush in the Oval Office in 2008. Brown never made a secret of his aspiration to lead Bermuda, telling a Howard University reporter in 2006, \\"I always wanted to seek the leadership of my country and I'm still in that process.\\" On 12 October 2006, Brown resigned from cabinet to make a second bid for leadership. At a previously scheduled party delegates conference on the evening of 27 October, he defeated the incumbent, Scott, by 107 to 76, and was sworn in as Premier on 30 October. In a subsequent interview with the Bermuda Sun, he said, \\"I have worked hard, studied hard, and prepared for the task of leadership to the best of the abilities that God has given me.\\" When he reshuffled the cabinet, he reclaimed the tourism and transportation portfolios and became, in addition to Premier, the Minister of Tourism and Transport. Since then, the Bermuda Government has made a number of proposals, issuing a Vision Statement: Taking Bermuda to the next level.Vision Statement: Taking Bermuda to the next level, bermudasun.bm; accessed 5 April 2016. Current issues include indigent medical care, traffic congestion, environmental concerns over development and waste disposal, race relations, and independence. On a private member bill concerning sexual orientation, Brown rejected the proposal, saying \\"I firmly believe in the right of all and any individuals to be free from discrimination in any form. However, I would not support the proposed Human Rights Amendment. I do not believe that there is a need for special protection of persons in Bermuda based on their sexual orientation\\". In April 2007, the government proposed restrictions on vehicle ownership, intended to curb Bermuda's growing road congestion problem. Among the solutions offered are free travel on buses and ferries. \\"There are too many cars in Bermuda. We must find a way - perhaps unpopular to many and disdained by others - to arrest the increase of cars on our beautiful island\\", he said. Polls in 2007 and 2008 indicated that two-thirds of the island's voters remain opposed to severing ties for various reasons, including loss of EU-status (which Bermuda currently has as a British overseas territory). Undaunted, Premier Brown said \\"I am firmly committed to Bermuda becoming an independent nation.\\" He has also spurned any participation in Whitehall's selection of the Governor of Bermuda, saying, \\"We want to clarify our position that we are not interested in sending any criteria for any future governors for selection for the reason we don't think it is our responsibility. [The British government] should send whoever they want to send.\\" On 2 November 2007, following the reading of the Throne Speech by Governor John Vereker, Premier Brown set 18 December 2007 as the date for Bermuda's general election. During the election campaign, the PLP government held a joint press conference with the Bermuda Police Service on 12 December 2007, where it was revealed that a bullet had been mailed to the Premier and was being viewed as a serious and credible threat. A police investigation was unable to determine the originator of the threat. Race relations continue to be a vexing issue in Bermuda, occasionally leading to heated exchanges with the press and the opposition UBP in Parliament. Brown rejected inappropriate questions as \\"plantation questions\\". He later explained, \\"A plantation question is for me a question which conjures up images of the plantation: of a master-servant relationship, a man-boy relationship. A question that would be asked of a black politician and not a white one. I will continue to indicate to reporters if that is what a question is.\\" Responding to opposition criticism of his wife's fund-raising activities voiced in the House of Assembly, he bristled, \\"Mr. Speaker, I have never had plans to cross this aisle, but in recent weeks that Honourable Member has said a few things that would encourage me to do so. I say to that Honourable Member that I would like to stay on this side of the House and not have come to the other side because it wouldn't be in order to vote for the UBP.\\" Acceptance of Uighur detainees On 7 October 2008, Ricardo M. Urbina, a United States federal judge, ordered the immediate release of seventeen Chinese Uighurs from Guantánamo Bay Detention Camp (the Uighur detainees in Guantanamo). The United States had previously determined that the Uighurs were never terrorists, and it no longer considered them enemy combatants. Judge Urbina ruled that their detention is illegal because their indefinite detention was without cause. The United States continued to detain the Uighurs, believing their lives would be in danger if they were released to China. There was considerable political pressure from members of Congress not to release the Uighurs in the United States, and the United States had a difficult time finding another country willing to accept them. Eventually, the Republic of Palau announced that it would accept the remaining Uighurs on a temporary basis. In June 2009, Brown announced that he had secretly made a deal with the United States to accept four of the Uighurs, who arrived on the island over-night, on humanitarian grounds; he also promised to make them Bermudian nationals (see also: Belonger status). The agreement to accept the Uighurs angered the government of the United Kingdom, which was deliberately not informed about the proposed agreement. The government of the United Kingdom maintains that it has the authority over the acceptance of the Uighurs because agreements between Bermuda and foreign nations are strictly under the United Kingdom's control; the government of Bermuda responded that the acceptance of the Uighurs is an immigration case and, thus, an internal matter. The decision was kept secret from Brown's Cabinet (Deputy Premier Paula Cox claimed she had been \\"politically neutered\\"), the Governor and the Bermuda Police Service, which would be responsible for any security concerns. The Opposition UBP tabled a motion of no confidence against Brown the next day, saying that the premier's actions violated the Constitution of Bermuda and bordered on dictatorship; Brown responded by saying that the \\"firestorm\\" \\"would pass\\" and that his position was not in danger, but that he regretted the response to his actions. The following week, a protest march was organised by a PLP member to oppose Brown's continuing premiership, which was dismissed by Brown. =Resignation= Brown had initially stated he only intended to serve one term as premier and announced to a party conference in October 2008 that he intended to step down as party leader and premier in October 2010. Fulfilling that campaign promise, Brown stepped down in October 2010. He was succeeded as leader of the PLP on 28 October 2010 by Paula Cox and in a by- election held on 14 December 2010 was succeeded as MP for Warwick South Central by PLP MP Marc Bean. =Commission of Inquiry= In June, 2011, a Commission of Inquiry was formed to investigate allegations of financial improprieties regarding Brown's medical practice and a subsequent Auditor General's report of financial irregularities during Brown's term in government. On February 11, 2017, the Bermuda Police Service raided Brown's Bermuda businesses as part of their ongoing investigation into corruption and fraud. As of November 2019, no charges have been brought. He owns two medical clinics, Bermuda Healthcare Services in Paget Parish and the Brown-Darrell Clinic in Smith's Parish, which could receive more than $1.2 million from taxpayers as compensation for the cuts in fees for medical scans imposed by the One Bermuda Alliance administration in 2017, said to be contrary to the advice of the Bermuda Health Council. Memoirs In November 2019, the publication of Brown's autobiography, Whom Shall I Fear? Pushing the Politics of Change, was announced. Brown said he wrote the book because, \\"... the Bermuda public in particular has been told a plethora of falsehoods about me. They have witnessed character assassination. I was determined to give them my side.” References External links *Official PLP biography *Bernews: Ewart Brown bio, photos, videos Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:Premiers of Bermuda Category:Deputy Premiers of Bermuda Category:Progressive Labour Party (Bermuda) politicians Category:UCLA School of Public Health alumni Category:Howard University alumni Category:Date of birth missing (living people) Category:Bermudian male sprinters Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games ","title":"Ewart Brown"},{"id":"7709990","text":"Southern Main Road at South Oropouche The Southern Main Road is a major road in Trinidad and Tobago running from Curepe in the north through Chaguanas, Couva, San Fernando, and Point Fortin to Icacos in the southwest.

Robinson wrote Life in California in 1846, an influential early description of the region, and Juaneño Native American people. Biography Alfred Robinson sailed to Alta California in 1829 in the employ of Bryant, Sturgis and Company, a Boston-based firm in the California hide and tallow trade. He married Anita de la Guerra de Noriega y Carrillo, of the locally prominent de la Guerra family of Santa Barbara. The marriage party is described by Richard Henry Dana, Jr., in \\"Two Years Before the Mast\\". After the Mexican Cession, and California was annexed by the U.S. in 1848 and became a state in 1850, Robinson worked for the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, and as a land manager during the 1850s through the 1880s. = Robinson Trust = In 1868 he formed the Robinson Trust with Abel Stearns, the most important land owner in Southern California in Los Angeles County. The real estate sales partnership included four San Francisco investors; Samuel Brannan, E. F. Northam, Charles B. Polhemus, Edward Martin. The era of the large cattle ranchos was on the way out. In its place came agriculture, as ranchos were broken up and generally sold in farms and ranches. The Trust acted as sales agents for the subdivisions. In order to gain maximum coverage for their campaign, they linked themselves to the 'California Immigrant Union' and helped guide that organization’s sales pitches. Alfred Robinson died in San Francisco in 1895. Californios and California Mission Indians = Book = In 1846, Alfred Robinson published Life in California, a comparatively sympathetic portrait of the lifeways and Californios political vicissitudes of the region under the Mexican Republic.

The PMN-150 produces approximately 1,500 fragments that have an effective range of 150 meters. The PMN-250 is a larger mine which produces 2,100 fragments that have an effective range of 250 meters. The mines have a number of electronic fuzes available including three microwave fuzes, an acoustic fuze and a seismic sensor. The mines can be remotely triggered or deactivated. =Anti-Transport Mine= The \\"Anti-Transport Mine\\" is a large circular directional fragmentation mine that uses an internal fragmentation matrix and five Misznay-Schardin plates. The fragmentation matrix produces a large number of small fragments, and the Misznay Schardin plates produce large fragments that can penetrate armoured vehicles. The mine appears to be based on the PMN-250 mine, and the mine is likely to have an effective range of 250 meters. =4AHM-100= The 4AHM-100 uses four 30 kilogram mines with a single central sensor. The mines are triggered simultaneously when the sensor detects a target inside the effective footprint of the mines. The mine is currently at the prototype stage. =AHM-200= The AHM-200 weighs 35 kilograms and contains 12 kilograms of TNT. The mine's warhead has two sections, a large rectangular warhead with a pre-notched fragmentation liner that produces 1,960 fragments, and a secondary warhead with five Misznay Schardin plates that produce large self-forging fragments. The fragments scatter in an arc of 20 degrees to an effective range of 200 meters, and will penetrate 10 millimeters of armour at 100 meters. =AHM-200-1= The AHM-200-1 weighs 90 kilograms. Like the AHM-200 it consists of two sections, a large circular fragmentation warhead with a filling of ball bearings, and a horizontal section with five Misznay Schardin effect plate charges. The two sections are mounted on a sturdy tripod with a sensor mounted above that contains a Doppler radar fuze and an acoustic fuze. The mine has an effective range of about 100 meters. =AHM-200-2= The AHM-200-2 weighs 90 kilograms, and is similar to the AHM-200-1, except that it uses a rectangular fragmentation warhead that produces 1,960 fragments.

Known as the Eagles, their home ground is Lockleys Oval in Lockleys.  Club History  The West Torrens Baseball Club was founded in 1918 when several members of the Freemasons Ramblers Baseball Club combined with players from the Underdale area to enter a team to represent West Torrens in the 1919 district baseball competition. The team finished second in its first season and won the \\"A\\" grade premiership the following year. The club's first ground was in the parklands on the north side of Henley Beach Road and on the city (east) side of Blakewell Bridge. Several parkland sites were used as home grounds over the next few years and at one stage even the current Richmond Oval site was used as a home base. During 1959 the club built its first \\"Home- Base\\" on the eastern boundary of Lockleys Oval. Due to increasing membership and the requirement for improved facilities, it became necessary to re-build. The present building, \\"Eagle Park\\", resulted from countless hours of work by a select band of dedicated members during 1971/72 season. It has since had additional rooms and facilities added.

Snyder, 1993, pp. 74–76, . It is the transverse aspect of the equirectangular projection, in that the globe is first rotated so the central meridian becomes the \\"equator\\", and then the normal equirectangular projection is applied. Considering the earth as a sphere, the projection is composed of the operations: :x = \\\\arcsin(\\\\cos \\\\varphi \\\\sin \\\\lambda) \\\\qquad y = \\\\arctan\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\tan\\\\varphi}{\\\\cos\\\\lambda}\\\\right). where λ is the longitude from the central meridian and φ is the latitude. When programming these equations, the inverse tangent function used is actually the atan2 function, with the first argument sin φ and the second . The reverse operation is composed of the operations: :\\\\varphi = \\\\arcsin(\\\\sin y \\\\cos x) \\\\qquad \\\\lambda = \\\\operatorname{atan2}(\\\\tan x, \\\\cos y). In practice, the projection has always been applied to models of the earth as an ellipsoid, which greatly complicates the mathematical development but is suitable for surveying. Nevertheless, the use of the Cassini projection has largely been superseded by the transverse Mercator projection, at least with central mapping agencies. Distortions Areas along the central meridian, and at right angles to it, are not distorted. Elsewhere, the distortion is largely in a north-south direction, and varies by the square of the distance from the central meridian. As such, the greater the longitudinal extent of the area, the worse the distortion becomes. Due to this, the Cassini projection works best on long, narrow areas, and worst on wide areas.  Elliptical form  Cassini is known as a spherical projection, but can be generalised as an elliptical form. Considering the earth as an ellipse, the projection is composed of these operations: :N = (1 - e^2 \\\\sin^2 \\\\varphi)^{-1/2} :T = \\\\tan^2 \\\\varphi :A = \\\\lambda \\\\cos \\\\varphi :C = \\\\frac{e^2}{1-e^2} \\\\cos^2 \\\\varphi :x = N \\\\left( A - T \\\\frac{A^3}{6} - (8-T+8C)T\\\\frac{A^5}{120} \\\\right) :y = M(\\\\varphi) - M(\\\\varphi_0) + (N \\\\tan \\\\varphi) \\\\left(\\\\frac{A^2}{2} + (5-T+6C)\\\\frac{A^4}{24} \\\\right) and M is the meridional distance function.

Early life and career Michiel Mol grew up with a wealthy family. His father, Jan Mol, co-founded a software company in 1966 called Volmac; the company itself turned out to be a huge success and Jan Mol sold it in 1992 to CAP Gemini. After obtaining a MSc degree in Computer Science from Leiden University, Michiel himself went into the software business. In 1993 he set up Lost Boys with several of his friends, developing software for the CD- ROM market. With the rapid growth of the internet, the company then started making internet software as well as moving into game development. Mol had his first venture into Formula One in 1999, when he and his company sponsored driver Jos Verstappen. Lost Boys then merged with Swedish company IconMedialab. Mol remained on the board and kept the Lost Boys Games division, before establishing a new company called Media Republic, aiming to use new technology to market products. Lost Boys Games was transformed into Guerrilla Games, notable for developing the PlayStation 2 game Killzone, during 2004 and a year later it was sold to the Sony Company. Formula One Mol later became a supporter of Christijan Albers, after Verstappen left Formula One, and led a group of investors that put together a deal to buy into Spyker Cars and take over the Midland F1 team. Mol became a major shareholder in Spyker and in September 2006 was appointed as F1 director of Spyker for a period of four years. On 14 August 2007, Michiel Mol left Spyker Cars as CEO amid speculation that it and Spyker F1 would be separated due to financial problems. In October 2007 Spyker F1 was sold to Indian businessman Vijay Mallya and renamed Force India. Mol remained as director and co-owner. With the bankruptcy of Force India halfway through 2018 and the takeover of the assets by a consortium led by Lawrence Stroll (father of racing driver Lance Stroll), Mol no longer held any rights in Force India. Space Expedition Corporation Mol is a co- founder of Space Expedition Corporation (SXC), which intends to offer suborbital space tourism flights and scientific research missions out of Space Port Curaçao. That company was since renamed XCOR_Aerospace and filed for bankruptcy in 2017. Personal life In July 2004, Mol married Paulien Huizinga, former Miss Universe Netherlands and now a Dutch TV personality. They lived together in Blaricum. Together they have a daughter and a son.

It is native to tropical South America, but kept in aquaculture and introduced elsewhere. It is also known by the names black pacu, black-finned pacu, giant pacu, cachama, gamitana, and sometimes as pacu (a name used for several other related species). The tambaqui is currently the only member of Colossoma, but the Piaractus species were also included in this genus in the past.OPEFE (27 December 2011). Genus Piaractus. Retrieved 2 March 2017. Distribution The tambaqui is native to freshwater habitats in the Amazon and Orinoco basins of tropical South America. In nutrient-rich whitewater rivers such as the Madeira, Juruá, Putumayo (Içá) and Purus it ranges throughout, all the way up to their headwaters.Araujo-Lima, C.A.R.M.; and M.L. Ruffino (2003). Migratory Fishes of the Brazilian Amazon. Pp. 233—302 in: Carolsfeld, J.; B. Harvey; C. Ross; and A. Baer (editors). Migratory Fishes of South America. In nutrient-poor blackwater rivers such as the Rio Negro and clearwater rivers such as several rightbank tributaries of the Madeira it generally only occurs in the lower c. and is rare beyond the lowermost c. . It is widely kept in aquaculture outside its native range in South America. Miocene fossils are known from the Magdalena River, but modern occurrence in this river is due to introductions by humans. Description thumb The tambaqui is the heaviest characin in the Americas (the lighter Salminus can grow longer) and the second heaviest scaled freshwater fish in South America (after the arapaima). It can reach up to in total length and in weight, but a more typical size is . The largest caught by rod-and-reel and recognized by IGFA weighed .IGFA: Tambaqui. Retrieved 2 March 2017. After the flood season, around 10% of a tambaqui's weight is the visceral fat reserves and at least another 5% is fat found in the head and muscles. It is similar in shape to the piranha and juveniles are sometimes confused with the carnivorous fish; the tambaqui is tall and laterally compressed with large eyes and a slightly arched back. Unlike more predatory species, the teeth of the tambaqui are molar-like, an adaption for crushing plant seeds and nuts. The lower half of its body is typically mainly blackish. The remaining is mainly gray, yellowish or olive, but the exact hue varies considerably and depends in part on habitat with individuals in blackwater being much darker than individuals from whitewater. The pelvic, anal and small pectoral fins are black.

The hybrid offspring can be difficult to identify by appearance alone. Ecology =Habitat, breeding and migration= This species is mostly solitary, but it migrates in large schools. During the non-breeding season, adults stay in flooded forests of white (várzea), clear and blackwater (igapó) rivers. They stay there for four to seven months during the flood season, but as the water level drops they move into the main river channels or to a lesser extent floodplain lakes. At the start of the next flood season, large schools move into whitewater rivers where they spawn between November and February. The exact spawning location in the whitewater rivers is not entirely certain, but apparently along woody shores or grassy levees. The schools then break up as the adults return to the flooded forest of white, clear and blackwater rivers, and the annual pattern is repeated. Larvae are found in whitewater rivers, including the Amazon River itself. Juveniles stay near macrophytes in floodplains and flooded forests year-round, only switching to the adult migration pattern when reaching sexual maturity. Maturity is reached at a length of about . The species regularly reaches an age of 40 years and may reach up to 65. =Oxygen, salt and pH resistance= When there is not enough oxygen in the river or lake, tambaqui obtain oxygen from the air. They are able to do this by their physical and inner body parts, such as their gills and swim bladder vascularization. Tambaqui is a fish that lives in freshwater. Juveniles can survive in brackish water when the salinity is gradually raised. Salinity levels above 20 g/L result in death. When juveniles are reared in salinities above 10 g/L, there is a significant detrimental effect on growth, haematological parameters and osmoregulation. In an experiment, tambaqui had the pH of their water changed. No deaths occurred to tambaqui if the pH did not fall to 3.0. The only internal difference that was noted in tambaqui when the pH was being altered was a change in the acid-base of the plasma and red cells. In another experiment, tambaquis were exposed to pH drops from 6.0 to 4.0, similar to what they would encounter in their natural habitat. Researchers found that the microbial communities of the tambaqui fish gut were very resilient to the pH drops, which could explain part of the ability of tambaquis to migrate between black and white water streams in the Amazon. =Diet= Tambaqui consume fruits and seeds, especially from woody angiosperms and herbaceous species. Depending on the quantity and food quality of these foods, it causes the fish to decide on their location of their habitat. In one study during the high- water season, 78—98 percent of the diet consisted of fruits. Another study of the stomach content of 138 specimens during the high-water season found that 44% of the weight was fruits and seeds, 30% was zooplankton and 22% was wild rice. Among 125 specimens during the low-water season, a higher percentage had empty stomachs (14%, about ten times more than in the high-water season) and about 70% of the total stomach content weight was zooplakton. In addition to seeds, fruits, wild rice and zooplakton, smaller levels of insects, snails, shrimps, small fish, filamentous algae and decaying plants are consumed. Seed dispersal The tambaqui plays an important role in dispersing plant seeds. The fruit seeds that fall in the water are consumed by tambaqui and the seed is dispersed somewhere else; this is similar to what birds do. This consumption includes about 35% of the trees and lianas during flood season and these seeds can grow after the floodwater calms down. Compared to the younger and smaller tambaqui, larger and older tambaqui are able to disperse the seeds in a faster rate. The gut of a well-fed tambaqui can contain more than seeds. In general, more seeds are able to pass undamaged through the pirapitinga (Piaractus brachypomus) than the tambaqui, meaning that the former overall is a more efficient seed disperser. Relationship to humans The flesh of the tambaqui is popular and fetches top prices in fish markets in its native range. It is marketed fresh and frozen. Wild populations of the tambaqui have declined because of overfishing and many currently caught fish are juveniles. In Manaus alone, the landings fell from c. per year in the 1970s to in 1996. Based on a review by IBAMA, it was the 11th most caught fish by weight in the Brazilian Amazon in 1998 (just ahead of the closely related pirapitinga, Piaractus brachypomus). The tambaqui is now widely kept in aquaculture. It can live in oxygen-poor waters and is very resistant to diseases. In Brazil, tambaqui is one of the main fish species that is farmed and therefore important to the country's economy. Studies of farmed tambaqui in Brazil have revealed a genetic diversity similar to that seen among wild populations. In fish farms this species is sometimes hybridized with Piaractus to produce offspring that accept a wider temperature range (colder water) than pure tambaqui. In Thailand, this fish, known locally as pla khu dam (ปลาคู้ดำ), was introduced from Hong Kong and Singapore as part of fish- farming projects, but has adapted to local conditions and thrives in the wild in some areas.Colossoma macropomum introduced to Thailand There is also an introduced population in Puerto Rico and singles (likely deliberate releases by aquarists) have been caught in a wide range of U.S. states,Nico, L.; P.

The surgeon makes a series of shallow cuts (transections) into the brain's cerebral cortex. These cuts are thought to interrupt some fibers that connect neighboring parts of the brain, but they do not appear to cause long-lasting impairment in the critical functions that these areas perform. Multiple subpial transections can help to reduce or eliminate seizures arising from vital functional areas of the cerebral cortex. This procedure has been successful in an unusual type of epilepsy called Landau-Kleffner syndrome, at least for a limited time. Bleeding at the site of the transection is possible, but the procedure is generally well tolerated. Major complications appear to be rare. Transections in language areas of the brain may mildly impair the language function served by that area.  Uses  Epilepsy surgery is reserved for people whose seizures are not well controlled by seizure medicines (this situation is sometimes describes as being medically refractory). In the past, epilepsy patients were referred for surgery only after they had taken medicine after medicine without success, often for 10 years or more. However, now the definition of medically refractory has changed and surgery is being performed as early as 1 to 2 years after the diagnosis of epilepsy is first made. In children, the definition of medically refractory is even more individualized to the specific child's situation. Surgery may be considered for some children after only weeks or months of treatment with seizure medicines. In general, a person is considered to be a potential candidate for surgery if adequate trials of two first-line seizure medicines (ones that are commonly effective in controlling the type of seizures the person is experiencing) and one two- drug combination all have failed to control the seizures. A trial of a medication is considered adequate when it has been increased gradually to the maximum dosage that does not cause serious side effects and then is given for a long enough period. If the person has frequent seizures, any improvement will be obvious after a short time. However, if the seizures generally occur far apart it may take months to determine whether the time between seizures is increasing. At some epilepsy centers, patients are offered additional conventional or experimental medications before surgery is considered. However, research suggests that each time a trial of medication fails to control a person's seizures, it becomes less likely that a different medicine or combination will be successful. Since uncontrolled seizures present serious physical risks and social and psychological consequences, the trend these days is to proceed with surgery much sooner than in the past if it seems appropriate for that person.  Preoperative assessment  Success rates for epilepsy surgery are constantly improving, and advances in preoperative assessments are largely responsible. Proper patient selection and a thorough presurgical workup are the cornerstones of surgical success. If a review of the person's experiences with seizure medicines shows that adequate tests of at least a few different medications have not succeeded in controlling the seizures, then the person may be referred to a specialist for a preoperative (or presurgical) assessment. The preoperative assessment has two general objectives: * to maximize seizure control after surgery * to minimize disruption of normal brain functioning The number and type of tests that make up the preoperative assessment will depend on the type of surgery being considered. General objectives of the tests include: *assessing the person's current status *determining the exact location of seizure activity *evaluating the surrounding areas of the brain to determine what kinds of problems the patient might experience after surgery.

Early life Morrell was born in North Berwick, York County, Maine. He attended public schools and moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1836, and entered a counting room as clerk. He later engaged in mercantile pursuits. Career In 1855 he moved to Johnstown, Pennsylvania, and became general manager of the Cambria Iron Company, which was the greatest manufacturer of iron and steel in the United States until the Johnstown Flood. Morrell also served as president of the local gas and water company from 1860 to 1884 and as president of the First National Bank of Johnstown from 1863 to 1884. He was president of the city council for many years. Morrell was elected as a Republican to the Fortieth and Forty-first Congresses. He served as chairman of the United States House Committee on Manufactures during the Fortieth and Forty-first Congresses. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1870. He was a commissioner to the Paris Exposition of 1878. =Johnstown Flood= Morrell became a member of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, site of the South Fork Dam, which formed Lake Conemaugh, in order to keep a watchful eye on the dam under its stewardship, and campaigned to club officials, especially to its founder, Benjamin Franklin Ruff, regarding the safety of the dam. The failure of that dam eventually caused the great Johnstown Flood of May 31, 1889, which killed more than 2,200 people, and was then the largest disaster in U.S. history. Morrell insisted on inspections of the dam's breastwork both by his own engineers and those of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Morrell's warnings went unheeded, and his offer to effect repairs, partially at his own expense, was rejected by club president, Benjamin F. Ruff (who died two years prior to the flood). Morrell died four years before the Johnstown Flood; his membership was then bought by his colleague, Cyrus Elder, who was legal counsel for the Cambria Iron and Steel Company.Johnstown’s Flood of 1889: Power Over Truth and The Science Behind the Disaster, by Neil M.

It usually appears after a significant stressor, either physical or emotional; when caused by the latter, the condition is sometimes called broken heart syndrome. Examples of physical stressors that can cause TTS are sepsis, shock, and pheochromocytoma, and emotional stressors include bereavement, divorce, or the loss of a job. Reviews suggest that of patients diagnosed with the condition, about 70-80% recently experienced a major stressor including 41-50% with a physical stressor and 26-30% with an emotional stressor. TTS can also appear in patients who have not experienced major stressors. The pathophysiology is not well understood, but a sudden massive surge of catecholamines such as adrenaline and norepinephrine from extreme stress or a tumor secreting these chemicals is thought to play a central role. Excess catecholamines, when released directly by nerves that stimulate cardiac muscle cells, have a toxic effect and can lead to decreased cardiac muscular function or \\"stunning\\". Further, this adrenaline surge triggers the arteries to tighten, thereby raising blood pressure and placing more stress on the heart, and may lead to spasm of the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle. This impairs the arteries from delivering adequate blood flow and oxygen to the heart muscle. Together, these events can lead to congestive heart failure and decrease the heart's output of blood with each squeeze. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy occurs worldwide. The condition is thought to be responsible for 2% of all acute coronary syndrome cases presenting to hospitals. Although TTS has generally been considered a self-limiting disease, spontaneously resolving over the course of days to weeks, contemporary observations show that the rates of cardiogenic shock and death in TTS are comparable to those of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients. These cases of shock and death have been associated with the occurrence of TTS secondary to an enciting physical stressor such as hemorrhage, brain injury sepsis, pulmonary embolism or severe COPD. It occurs more commonly in postmenopausal women. The name \\"takotsubo\\" comes from the Japanese word takotsubo \\"octopus trap\\", because the left ventricle of the heart takes on a shape resembling an octopus trap when affected by this condition.  Risk factors  = Stress trigger = Although there have been documented cases of TTS without a triggering stressor, it is widely recognized that TTS is preceded by a stressful event. Case series looking at large groups of patients report that some patients develop takotsubo cardiomyopathy after an emotional stress. Some patients have a preceding clinical stressor (such as a brain injury, asthma attack or exacerbation of a chronic illness) and research has indicated that this type of stress may may even occur more often than emotionally stressful triggers. Roughly one-third of patients have no preceding stressful event. A 2009 large case series from Europe found that takotsubo cardiomyopathy was slightly more frequent during the winter season. This may be related to two possible/suspected pathophysiological causes: coronary spasms of microvessels, which are more prevalent in cold weather, and viral infections – such as Parvovirus B19 – which occur more frequently during the winter. = Gender = Women, specifically postmenopausal women, are at greatest risk of developing TTS. This has led some researchers to theorize about the possible protective effects of estrogen in preventing TTS. = Genetic risk factors = It is currently being investigated if certain genetic traits associated with catecholamine receptors found on cardiac muscle cells play a role in the development of TTS. There is limited evidence tying TTS directly to a specific genetic expression or mutation, however there is currently a widely held hypothesis supporting the idea of the interaction between environmental factors and the interplay of genetic predisposition leading to the susceptibility to microvascular alterations that contribute to the TTS disease process. Signs and symptoms The typical presentation of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is chest pain with or without shortness of breath and associated electrocardiogram (ECG) changes mimicking a myocardial infarction of the anterior wall. During the course of evaluation of the patient, a bulging out of the left ventricular apex with a hypercontractile base of the left ventricle is often noted. It is the hallmark bulging-out of the apex of the heart with preserved function of the base that earned the syndrome its name takotsubo \\"octopus trap\\", in Japan, where it was first described. Stress is the main factor in takotsubo cardiomyopathy, with more than 85% of cases set in motion by either a physically or emotionally stressful event that prefaces the start of symptoms.Sharkey, S., Lesser, J., & Maron, B. (2011). Takotsubo (stress) cardiomyopathy. American Heart Association. Retrieved from http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/124/18/e460.full Examples of emotional stressors include grief from the death of a loved one, fear of public speaking, arguing with a spouse, relationship disagreements, betrayal, and financial problems. Acute asthma, surgery, chemotherapy, and stroke are examples of physical stressors. In a few cases, the stress may be a happy event, such as a wedding, winning a jackpot, a sporting triumph, or a birthday. Pathophysiology The cause of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is not fully understood, but several mechanisms have been proposed. It is well documented that elevated catecholamine levels have been implicated in the vast majority of TTS cases. Theories suggest a link between brain activation of stress-related biochemicals and the effects these chemicals have on areas of the heart. More specifically, adrenal stimulation by the sympathetic nervous system has been noted in cases ranging from physical events such as ischemic stroke, to emotional events such as depression or loss of a loved-one. How these increased levels of catecholamines act in the body to produce the changes seen with TTS is not clearly understood. Research supports the widely- held understanding that microvascular dysfunction and coronary vasospasm caused by a rapid influx of catecholamines to cardiac myocytes results in apical stunning and transient cardiomyopathy. #Microvascular dysfunction/Transient vasospasm: Some of the original researchers of takotsubo suggested that multiple simultaneous spasms of coronary arteries could cause enough loss of blood flow to cause transient stunning of the myocardium. Other researchers have shown that vasospasm is much less common than initially thought.Kawai et al. JPJ 2000 It has been noted that when there are vasospasms, even in multiple arteries, that they do not correlate with the areas of myocardium that are not contracting. However, the idea of coronary artery vasospasm is still believed to contribute to the TTS disease process. The theory of vasospasm is not easily separated from that of microvascular dysfunction and in fact, microvascular dysfunction could explain vasospasticity. Impaired microvascular function is seen in a vast majority, if not all, of patients with TTS and is currently one of the most supported theories. Most of the dysfunction occurs as a result of abnormalities within the endothelial linings of blood vessels supplying the heart. In TTS, these highly sensitive interior linings of the vessels have reduced functionality which create dysregulation of vascular tone and predispose the individual to vasoconstriction. When the increased vasoconstrictor effects of catecholamines are introduced, the result is acute cardiac ischemia. #Catecholamine-induced myocyte injury: It has been suggested that the response to catecholamines (such as epinephrine and norepinephrine, released in response to stress) leads to heart muscle dysfunction that contributes to takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The effects of this toxicity can be greater in those with a predisposition to anxiety or panic disorders. Delivery of catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine) via circulating blood and through direct delivery from cardiac nerves is increased by the stimulation of stress control centers of the brain. During an emotionally or physically stressful event, brain centers initiate the sympathetic nervous pathways and increase myocardial activity. Excessive catecholamine stimulation has a toxic effect on cardiac muscle cells which creates necrosis of the contractile units of cells similarly seen during acute myocardial infarction. The increased workload of cardiac muscle created by the stimulation of catecholamines, increases the need for more blood and oxygen to these muscles to sustain function. When these demands are unable to be met, the heart is starved of blood and oxygen and begins to die. Included in the cytotoxic sequela of catecholamine toxicity is the molecular transformation of the cardiac myocyte to produce apical stunning. # Mid-ventricular obstruction, apical stunning: It has been suggested that a mid-ventricular wall thickening with outflow obstruction is important in the pathophysiology. This stunning is largely seen as a protective effect produced by the flood of excess catecholamines into the cardiac muscle cell. Overstimulation of catecholamine receptors create physiological changes in the receptor which has an inverse effect on cardiac cellular function. Termed 'cellular-trafficking', this property of the cardiac muscle cell is actually a molecular transformation of the cell to produce a down-regulation of catecolaminergic sensitivity. This means that in the presence of excess epinephrine, a normal cardiac contraction is inhibited in an effort to reduce energy demands, prevent hyperactivity and spare the integrity of the cell. Further bolstering this idea is the concentration of these kinds of receptors in the heart. Higher concentrations of the receptor effected to produce cardiac stunning are found closer to the apex of the ventricle. This is what creates the classic ballooning effect of the ventricle. It is likely that there are multiple factors at play that could include some amount of vasospasm and failure of the microvasculature. These factors can overlap and create the complex sequela leading to ischemia and left ventricle contraction abnormality. For instance, estrogen, which confers protection to women by improving blood flow to heart muscle, is one biochemical pathway implicated in the TTS disease process. Once this protective mechanism is reduced through the decreased production of estrogen after menopause, there is thought to be an increase in endothelial dysfunction predisposing an individual to vasoconstriction and cardiac ischemia. An inciting stressful event elicits the release of catecholamines into the blood stream to create increased heart muscle activity and metabolism. This leads to further cardiac microvascular endothelial dysfunction through oxidative stress, alteration of ion-mediated channels, and electrolyte disturbances which ultimately alter myocardial cell membrane permeability and dysfunction. Coupled with direct heart muscle toxicity, this crescendo of factors are implicated in the ballooning and heart failure characteristically seen in TTS. A 2019 case involved a 60-year-old woman presenting with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy due to over-consumption of wasabi, mistaking it for avocado. Diagnosis Several well regarded institutions of medical research have produced clinical criteria useful in diagnosing TTS. One of the first sets of guidelines was initially published in 2004 and again in 2008 by the Mayo Clinic. Other research institutions proposing diagnostic criteria include the Japanese Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Study Group, Gothenburg University, Johns Hopkins University, the Takotsubo Italian Network and the Heart Failure Associates TTS Taskforce of the European Society of Cardiology. All of the research institutions agree on at least two main criteria needed to accurately diagnose TTS: 1) transient left ventricular wall motion abnormality and 2) the absence of a condition obviously explaining this wall motion abnormality (coronary artery lesion, hypoperfusion, myocarditis, toxicity, etc.). Other commonly acknowledged criteria necessary for diagnosis include characteristic EKG changes and mild to modest elevation in cardiac troponin. Transient apical ballooning syndrome or takotsubo cardiomyopathy is found in 1.7–2.2% of patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome. While the original case studies reported on individuals in Japan, takotsubo cardiomyopathy has been noted more recently in the United States and Western Europe. It is likely that the syndrome previously went undiagnosed before it was described in detail in the Japanese literature. Evaluation of individuals with takotsubo cardiomyopathy typically includes a coronary angiogram to rule out occlusion of the left anterior descending artery, which will not reveal any significant blockages that would cause the left ventricular dysfunction. Provided that the individual survives their initial presentation, the left ventricular function improves within two months. The diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy may be difficult upon presentation. The ECG findings often are confused with those found during an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction. It classically mimics ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, and is characterised by acute onset of transient ventricular apical wall motion abnormalities (ballooning) accompanied by chest pain, shortness of breath, ST-segment elevation, T-wave inversion or QT-interval prolongation on ECG. Cardiac enzymes are usually negative and are moderate at worst, and cardiac catheterization usually shows absence of significant coronary artery disease. The diagnosis is made by the pathognomonic wall motion abnormalities, in which the base of the left ventricle is contracting normally or is hyperkinetic while the remainder of the left ventricle is akinetic or dyskinetic. This is accompanied by the lack of significant coronary artery disease that would explain the wall motion abnormalities. Although apical ballooning has been described classically as the angiographic manifestation of takotsubo, it has been shown that left ventricular dysfunction in this syndrome includes not only the classic apical ballooning, but also different angiographic morphologies such as mid-ventricular ballooning and, rarely, local ballooning of other segments. The ballooning patterns were classified by Shimizu et al. as takotsubo type for apical akinesia and basal hyperkinesia, reverse takotsubo for basal akinesia and apical hyperkinesia, mid-ventricular type for mid-ventricular ballooning accompanied by basal and apical hyperkinesia, and localised type for any other segmental left ventricular ballooning with clinical characteristics of takotsubo-like left ventricular dysfunction. In short, the main criteria for the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy are: the patient must have experienced a stressor before the symptoms began to arise; the patient's ECG reading must show abnormalities from a normal heart; the patient must not show signs of coronary blockage or other common causes of heart troubles; the levels of cardiac enzymes in the heart must be elevated or irregular; and the patient must recover complete contraction and be functioning normally in a short amount of time.

Treatment is dependent on whether patients experience heart failure or acute hypotension and shock. In many individuals, left ventricular function normalizes within two months. Aspirin and other heart drugs also appear to help in the treatment of this disease, even in extreme cases. After the patient has been diagnosed, and myocardial infarction (heart attack) ruled out, the aspirin regimen may be discontinued, and treatment becomes that of supporting the patient. There is currently no internationally agreed protocol for treatment of this condition. While medical treatments are important to address the acute symptoms of takotsubo cardiomyopathy, further treatment includes lifestyle changes. It is important that the individual stay physically healthy while learning and maintaining methods to manage stress, and to cope with future difficult situations. Although the symptoms of takotsubo cardiomyopathy usually go away on their own and the condition completely resolves itself within a few weeks, some serious short and long-term complications can happen that must be treated. These most commonly include congestive heart failure and very low blood pressure, and less commonly include blood clotting in the apex of the left ventricle, irregular heart beat, and tearing of the heart wall. =Heart failure= For patients in acute heart failure, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and beta blockers, are considered mainstays of heart failure treatment. But use of beta blockers specifically for takotsubo cardiomyopathy is controversial, because they may confer no benefit. =Low blood pressure= For people with cardiogenic shock, medical treatment is based on whether a left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction is present. Therefore, early echocardiography is necessary to determine proper management. For those with obstructed LVOTs inotropic agents should not be used, but instead should be managed like patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, (e.g. phenylephrine and fluid resuscitation). For cases in which the LVOT is not obstructed, inotropic therapy (e.g. dobutamine and dopamine) may be used, but with the consideration that takotsubo is caused by excess catecholamines. Furthermore, mechanical support with an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) is well- established as supportive treatment. Prognosis Despite the grave initial presentation in some of the patients, most of the patients survive the initial acute event, with a very low rate of in-hospital mortality or complications. Once a patient has recovered from the acute stage of the syndrome, they can expect a favorable outcome and the long-term prognosis is excellent for most. Even when ventricular systolic function is heavily compromised at presentation, it typically improves within the first few days and normalises within the first few months. Although infrequent, recurrence of the syndrome has been reported and seems to be associated with the nature of the trigger. Stress cardiomyopathy is now a well-recognized cause of acute congestive heart failure, lethal abnormal heart rhythms, and rupture of the heart wall. Epidemiology Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is rare, affecting between 1.2% and 2.2% of people in Japan and 2% to 3% in Western countries who suffer a myocardial infarction. It also affects far more women than men with 90% of cases being women, most postmenopausal. Scientists believe one reason is that estrogen causes the release of catecholamine and glucocorticoid in response to mental stress. It is not likely for the same recovered patient to experience the syndrome twice, although it has happened in rare cases. The average ages at onset are between 58 and 75 years. Less than 3% of cases occurred in patients under age 50. History The Japanese octopus traps after which this disease is named Rees, et al. wrote in 1967 that the death of a close relative increases the risk of dying within one year by a factor of seven. Engel wrote about sudden and rapid death during psychological stress in 1971 and itemized 8 causation categories: [1] on the impact of the collapse or death of a close person; [2] during acute grief; [3] on threat of loss of a close person; [4] during mourning or on an anniversary; [5] on loss of status or self-esteem; [6] personal danger or threat of injury; [7] after the danger is over; [8] reunion, triumph, or happy ending. He proposed these events provoke neurovegetative responses, involving both the flight-fight and conservation- withdrawal systems, conducive to lethal cardiac events, particularly in individuals with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Although the first scientific description of takotsubo cardiomyopathy was not until the 1990s, Cebelin and Hirsch wrote about human stress cardiomyopathy in 1980. The two looked at homicidal assaults that had happened in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, the past 30 years, specifically those with autopsies who had no internal injury, but had died of physical assault. They found that 11 of 15 had myofibrillar degeneration similar to animal stress studies. In the end, they concluded their data supported \\"the theory of catecholamine mediation of these myocardial changes in man and of the lethal potential of stress through its effect on the heart\\". The first studied case of takotsubo cardiomyopathy was in Japan in 1991 by Sato et al. More cases of the syndrome appeared in Japan within the next decade, although western medicine had still not acknowledged it. The syndrome finally occurred in 1997 when Pavin, et al., wrote about two cases of \\"reversible LV dysfunction precipitated by acute emotional stress.\\" The western world had not heard of such a thing at the time, as it was incredibly rare and often misdiagnosed. The Japanese at last reported about the syndrome to the west in 2001 under the name \\"transient LV apical ballooning\\" though at this point the west had already heard of numerous cases. The syndrome reached international audiences through the media in 2005 when the New England Journal of Medicine wrote about the syndrome.

In 1928, the first baccalaureate nursing program in the South began at the University of Virginia. Men were first admitted in the 1960s. The first nursing PhD program offered in Virginia began at the School of Nursing in 1982, and in 2008, it became the first facility in Virginia to offer a DNP (Doctor of Nursing Practice) degree - the terminal degree for nursing clinicians. Academics The School of Nursing offers a variety of options for attaining or augmenting a nursing degree. Undergraduate * Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) ** The Bachelor of Science in Nursing program is a four-year undergraduate program, offered for both traditional entry students and second- year transfers from a traditional undergraduate program. Students begin clinical coursework during their second year, including rigorous courses in pathophysiology and pharmacology (requirements that are over and above the scope of traditional BSN programs), and also begin clinical rotations the second semester of their second year after developing skills in the Clinical Simulation Learning Center, the School's 10,000 square foot skills lab. * RN to BSN Program ** The RN to BSN program is a part-time, executive format program uniquely tailored for RNs who wish to earn the personal and professional benefits a baccalaureate degree confers. Recognizing the experience an RN possesses prior to admission, RN to BSN students are individually assigned to work with a faculty advisor to create a plan of study to best meet their own personal academic and professional goals. * Third Year Transfer to BSN ** The Third Year Transfer to BSN program is a five-semester long program that enrolls students who have completed two years (55-60 credits) of college level work before transfer, either from a four-year institution, or from a two-year community college or associate degree program. Applicants who are accepted for transfer will enter the School of Nursing in the summer session. Graduate * MSN **The Master's of Science in Nursing is an advanced practice degree that trains RNs to take a more direct role in patient care and managing care plans. The MSN degrees is available through a variety of specialty areas: Adult-Gerontology Acute Care CNS or NP; Family Nurse Practitioner; Pediatric Nurse Practitioner; Neonatal Nurse Practitioner; Pediatric-Acute Care Nurse Practitioner; and Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner. * Post-Master's Programs ** Post-Master's Programs are for individuals who already possess a MSN who wish to earn additional specialty certifications. Post-master's graduate are trained to assume the roles of clinician, educator and researcher, as well as clinical consultant and clinical leader. Emphasis is placed on providing students with the advanced theoretical knowledge and practice skills needed to function in increasingly complex care settings across the care continuum. Evidenced based practice, outcomes management, clinical research, and advanced clinical decision-making are also emphasized. Post-Masters Programs are offered in a variety of specialties. * Doctoral (PhD and DNP) and Post-Doctoral Programs **The School of Nursing offers two doctoral programs in nursing to prepare expert clinicians and practitioners, as well as nursing scientists and researchers, to expand nursing knowledge in this new century in nursing leadership and faculty roles. The DNP program, in particular, focuses students to become leaders with expertise in specialty practice who can utilize research evidence to effect practice change, as opposed to the more theoretical approach of the PhD program. * Clinical Nurse Leader (CNL) **The UVA School of Nursing's Clinical Nurse Leader program is a fast-track into the nursing profession for individuals with at least a bachelor's degree who wish to pivot into the field from another profession. Over its two-year, full-time program, CNL students (who earn a master's degree) become nurse generalists, prepared to direct care at the unit level. Affiliations and accreditation The School of Nursing is a member of the Council of Baccalaureate and Higher Degree programs of the National League for Nursing, the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, and the Southern Council on Collegiate Education for Nursing of the Southern Regional Education Board. The school is nationally accredited, and approved by the Virginia State Board of Nursing. The School of Nursing is also the sole American nursing school to participate in Universitas 21, with exchange and research programs set up with the University of Auckland in New Zealand, and Oxford University in the United Kingdom. It also offers students regular opportunities to study and serve in Nicaragua, South Africa, St. Kitts, Denmark, Australia and New Zealand.

The airfield was built on ancient parkland belonging to Easton Lodge and some 10,000 trees were destroyed to enable its construction,Easton Lodge Gardens: History Parks and Gardens UK, accessed 2010-12-17The Gardens of Easton Lodge: After Daisy 1938 accessed 2010-12-17 including over 200 mature oak trees. It consisted of a set of three converging runways each containing a concrete runway for takeoffs and landings, optimally placed at 60-degree angles to each other in a triangular pattern. The runways were a main runway, aligned 15/33 and two secondary secondary runways, aligned 11/29 and 04/22. An encircling perimeter track was also constructed, containing 50 loop-type hardstands. =United States Army Air Forces use= Great Dunmow airfield was opened on 1 July 1943 and was used by the United States Army Air Forces Eighth and Ninth Air Forces. It was known as USAAF Station AAF-164 for security reasons by the USAAF during the war, and by which it was referred to instead of location. It's USAAF Station Code was \\"GD\\". USAAF Station Units assigned to RAF Great Dunmow were: * 70th Service Group : 380th Service Squadron; HHS 70th Service Group * 20th Station Complement Squadron * 21st Weather Squadron * 39th Mobile Reclamation and Repair Squadron * 40th Mobile Communications Squadron Regular Army Station Units included: * Quartermaster Depot Q_108 * 1577th Quartermaster Battalion * 628th Quartermaster Battalion * 1054th Quartermaster Company * 1087th Signal Company * 1176th Military Police Company * 1769th Ordnance Supply & Maintenance Company * 2057th Quartermaster Truck Company * 2196th Quartermaster Truck Company * 3215th Quartermaster Service Company * 335th Quartermaster Depot Company * 340th Quartermaster Depot Company * 807th Chemical Company * 2045th Engineer Fire Fighting Platoon * 194th Medical Dispensary 386th Bombardment Group (Medium) A bomber crew of the 552d Bombardment Squadron with their B-26 Marauder (RG-P, serial number 41-31633) nicknamed \\"Hot Pistol\\". The first unit to use Great Dunmow was the American 386th Bombardment Group (Medium) which arrived from RAF Boxted on 24 September 1943. The group was assigned to the VIII Air Support Command 3d Bombardment Wing and flew Martin B-26B/C Marauders. Operational squadrons of the 322d were: * 552d Bombardment Squadron (RG) * 553d Bombardment Squadron (AN) * 554th Bombardment Squadron (RU) * 555th Bombardment Squadron (YA) Missions of the 386th concentrated on airfields but also bombed marshalling yards and gun positions during the first months of combat. In common with other Marauder units of the 3d Bomb Division, the 386th was transferred to Ninth Air Force 98th Bombardment Wing on 16 October 1943. On 2 October 1944, the 386th Bomb Group moved to Beaumont-sur-Oise (A-60) Airfield, in Normandy France. On the continent, the 386th BG used the following Advanced Landing Grounds: * A-60 Beaumont-sur-Oise France 2 October 1944 * A-92 St Trond Belgium 9 April–July 1945 After V-E Day the group returned to the United States, inactivating at Seymour Johnson AFB North Carolina on 7 August 1945. The airfield was abandoned in 1948. Current use Memorial to the wartime used of Great Dunmow With the end of military control in 1950 the grassed areas were cut for a grass meal company through the 1950s which supplied it to various farms in the region. Starting in 1960, farming operations commenced and the concrete areas were removed for aggregate in 1965/66 for use as part of the new A12 road. Today, there is very little left except some single track agricultural roads remaining from the perimeter track and a blister hangar with a few nissen huts near Easton Lodge. The runway layout and the airfield perimeter track are easily identified in aerial photography, but no substantial amount of concrete remains. The 22 end of the secondary northeast runway does however, have a short full width of runway intact, being used for manure storage.http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&source;=s_q&hl;=en&geocode;=&q;=CM6+2BB&sll;=54.489103,-2.820654&sspn;=0.018496,0.055747&ie;=UTF8&hq;=&hnear;=Dunmow+CM6+2BB,+United+Kingdom≪=51.887991,0.318983&spn;=0.000587,0.001742&t;=h&z;=20 Google Maps The current owners, Land Securities hope to redevelop the site and surrounding area, including the construction of around 9,000 homes.Strategic Land Portfolio Land Securities, accessed 2010-12-17 There is a small museum in Great Dunmow which holds some exhibits of the airfield and the 386th Bomb Group, along with a stained glass window memorial in Little Easton church.

The park follows Pennsylvania Route 120 for between Emporium (in Cameron County, which contains of the park) and Lock Haven (in Clinton County, which contains the other ). Bucktail State Park Natural Area park runs along Sinnemahoning Creek and the West Branch Susquehanna River and also passes through Renovo (in Clinton County). The park is named for the Civil War Pennsylvania Bucktails Regiment and is primarily dedicated to wildlife viewing, especially elk. Course The West Branch Susquehanna River as seen in Bucktail State Park Natural Area The course of Bucktail State Park Natural Area is as follows: leaving the city of Lock Haven, Pennsylvania Route 120 and the West Branch Susquehanna River pass through the following municipalities in Clinton County heading west (in order): Allison, Woodward, Bald Eagle, Colebrook, Grugan, and Chapman townships, the boroughs of Renovo and South Renovo, and Noyes Township. Next Pennsylvania 120 leaves the West Branch Susquehanna River and follows Sinnemahoning Creek west through East Keating Township, then crosses into Cameron County. There Pennsylvania Route 120 and Sinnemahoning Creek pass west through Grove and Gibson Townships and enter the borough of Driftwood, where Route 120 follows the Driftwood Branch of Sinnemahoning Creek north through Gibson, Lumber, Portage, and Shippen townships, finally reaching the borough of Emporium and the western end of Bucktail State Park. History Pennsylvania Route 120 follows an old Native American Trail, the Sinnemahoning Path. This trail was used by Native Americans to cross the eastern continental divide (specifically the Allegheny Front) between the Susquehanna River (which drains into the Chesapeake Bay) and the Allegheny River (which forms the Ohio River with the Monongahela River at Pittsburgh and eventually drains into the Gulf of Mexico via the Mississippi River). American Pioneers also used the trail to make their way west and it was also known as the Bucktail Trail. As the technology of road building advanced, what was once a Native American Trail became the two lane highway known today as Pennsylvania Route 120. Pennsylvania Route 120 was officially designated as Bucktail State Park in 1933 by an act of the Pennsylvania Legislature. The Act says: Pennsylvania Route 120 in Clinton County Although the park covers , much of the land within the park boundaries is actually in private hands. The rest of the land in the valleys is owned by the Bureau of State Parks and the Bureau of Forestry as part of Elk State Forest and Sproul State Forest. Wildlife watching Bucktail State Park Natural Area is in the West Branch and Sinnemahoning Valleys. River valleys are ideal gathering points for wildlife as the valleys tend to be warmer and wetter than the surrounding mountains. Animals are drawn to the warm and wet valley. The river valley is a natural passageway for plants and animals. The valley is home to river birch and sycamore trees. Osprey, a wide variety of duck, white-tailed deer, bald eagles, otter, merganser, mink and black bear can all be seen living in the boundaries of Bucktail State Park Natural Area. Elk can be seen in the early morning and late afternoon hours in the northern portions of the park. Special elk viewing playforms have been built in Sinnemahoning State Park and near the small village of Bennezette.

The game was invented by Allan Goff of Novatia Labs, who describes it as \\"a way of introducing quantum physics without mathematics\\", and offering \\"a conceptual foundation for understanding the meaning of quantum mechanics\\". Background The motivation to invent quantum tic-tac-toe was to explore what it means to be in two places at once. In classical physics, a single object cannot be in two places at once. In quantum physics, however, the mathematics used to describe quantum systems seems to imply that before being subjected to quantum measurement (or \\"observed\\") certain quantum particles can be in multiple places at once. (The textbook example of this is the double-slit experiment.) How the universe can be like this is rather counterintuitive. There is a disconnect between the mathematics and our mental images of reality, a disconnect that is absent in classical physics. This is why quantum mechanics supports multiple \\"interpretations\\". The researchers who invented quantum tic-tac-toe were studying abstract quantum systems, formal systems whose axiomatic foundation included only a few of the axioms of quantum mechanics. Quantum tic-tac-toe became the most thoroughly studied abstract quantum system and offered insights that spawned new research. It also turned out to be a fun and engaging game, a game which also provides good pedagogy in the classroom. The rules of quantum tic-tac-toe attempt to capture three phenomena of quantum systems: ;superposition: the ability of quantum objects to be in two places at once. ;entanglement: the phenomenon where distant parts of a quantum system display correlations that cannot be explained by either timelike causality or common cause. ;collapse:the phenomenon where the quantum states of a system are reduced to classical states. Collapses occur when a measurement happens, but the mathematics of the current formulation of quantum mechanics is silent on the measurement process. Many of the interpretations of quantum mechanics derive from different efforts to deal with the measurement problem. Gameplay The second player has just made move O8. The first player must now choose whether to collapse O8 into the upper right square or the middle square. (Either way, O is going to get three-in-a-row.) X has chosen to collapse O8 into the middle square, which forces the rest of the entanglements to collapse. This gives X their own three-in-a-row, but since the maximum subscript of O2O4O6 (namely, 6) is less than the maximum subscript of X1X3X7 (namely, 7), O gets one point while X gets only one-half point. O still wins. Quantum tic-tac-toe captures the three quantum phenomena discussed above by modifying one basic rule of classical tic-tac-toe: the number of marks allowed in each square. Additional rules specify when and how a set of marks \\"collapses\\" into classical moves. On each move, the current player marks two squares with their letter (X or O), instead of one, and each letter (X or O) is subscripted with the number of the move (beginning counting with 1). The pair of marks are called spooky marks. (Because X always moves first, the subscripts on X are always odd and the subscripts on O are always even.) For example, player 1's first move might be to place \\"X1\\" in both the upper left and lower right squares. The two squares thus marked are called entangled. During the game, there may be as many as eight spooky marks in a single square (if the square is entangled with all eight other squares). The phenomenon of collapse is captured by specifying that a \\"cyclic entanglement\\" causes a \\"measurement\\". A cyclic entanglement is a cycle in the entanglement graph; for example, if * square 1 is entangled via move X1 with square 4, and * square 4 is entangled via move X3 with square 8, and * square 8 is in turn entangled via move O4 with square 1, then these three squares form a cyclic entanglement. At the end of the turn on which the cyclic entanglement was created, the player whose turn it is not -- that is, the player who did not create the cycle -- chooses one of two ways to \\"measure\\" the cycle and thus cause all the entangled squares to \\"collapse\\" into classical tic-tac-toe moves. In the preceding example, since player 2 created the cycle, player 1 decides how to \\"measure\\" it. Player 1's two options are: # X1 collapses into square 1. This forces O4 to collapse into square 8 and X3 to collapse into square 4. # X1 collapses into square 4. This forces X3 to collapse into square 8 and O4 to collapse into square 1. Any other chains of entanglements hanging off the cycle would also collapse at this time; for example, if square 1 were also entangled via O2 with square 5, then either measurement above would force O2 to collapse into square 5. (Note that it is impossible for two or more cyclic entanglements to be created in a single turn.) When a move collapses into a single square, that square is permanently marked (in larger print) with the letter and subscript of the collapsed move -- a classical mark. A square containing a classical mark is fixed for the rest of the game; no more spooky marks may be placed in it. The first player to achieve a tic-tac-toe (three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) consisting entirely of classical marks is declared the winner. Since it is possible for a single measurement to collapse the entire board and give classical tic-tac-toes to both players simultaneously, the rules declare that the player whose tic-tac- toe has the lower maximum subscript earns one point, and the player whose tic- tac-toe has the higher maximum subscript earns only one-half point.

Construction and naming The ship was built at Port-Liberté (now Lorient) and launched on 10 Prairial de l'An II (29 May 1794). Her name refers to the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, one of the founding documents of the French Revolution. Service history Droits de l'Homme, was involved in the Action of 6 November 1794, chasing the British 74s and . Droits de l'Homme caught up with Alexander first, but was forced out of action with damage to her rigging, but Alexander was soon caught by and and captured. Droits de l'Homme was lightly involved in Battle of Groix, on 22 June 1795, firing few if any shots during the battle. =Expédition d'Irlande= In December 1796 Droits de l'Homme, under capitaine de vaisseau Raymond de Lacrosse, took part in the invasion attempt against Ireland, carrying 549 soldiers. On their way, the fleet was dispersed by tempests. The Droits de l'Homme arrived at Bantry Bay and cruised off the coast, capturing the brigs Cumberland and Calypso. She stayed there for eight days to ascertain that no French ship was in distress on the coast, and departed for Brittany. Droits de l'Homme wrecked On 25 Nivôse An V in the Action of 13 January 1797, off Penmarch, Droits de l'Homme met the British frigates (44), under Sir Edward Pellew, and (36), commanded by Robert C. Reynolds. The sea was rough, preventing Droits de l'Homme from using her lower deck batteries and from boarding the British. Lacrosse was wounded; he gave command of the ship to his second officer, Prévost de Lacroix, and had his crew swear not to strike their colours.Parkinson, C. Northcote (1934) Edward Pellew, Viscount Exmouth, Admiral of the Red. London: Methuen & Co., pp. 175-78 After 13 hours of combat, running out of ammunition, the British broke contact when Indefatigable sighted land ahead. Indefatigable, despite having damage to her masts and rigging, managed to beat off the lee shore and escape Penmarch reefs; Amazon ran aground and was destroyed near Plozévet, and her crew captured. Droits de l'Homme, having lost her rudder, masts and anchors, ran aground off Plozévet.Parkinson, C. Northcote (1934) Edward Pellew, Viscount Exmouth, Admiral of the Red. London: Methuen & Co., pp. 179-80 Some of the crew were rescued by the ship's boats and fishing boats from nearby villages, but the rescue was interrupted for five days by the storm; 60 men died for lack of food and water. General Jean-Amable Humbert, who was commanding the soldiers aboard, narrowly escaped drowning, and between 250 and 390 men died in the wreck. Captain Lacrosse was last to leave the ship. Commemoration In 1840, Major Pipon, an English officer who had been a prisoner aboard, erected an inscribed menhir on the coast in remembrance of the tragedy. In 1876 it was broken into several pieces by the weather, but restored in 1882.

The house, at 318 High Street, faces west from the east side of High Street north of the corner at High and Court Streets. A large wooded lawn extends to the Honors College (Russell House 1828) property to the north. High Street between Church and Washington Streets was the most prestigious residential area in Middletown during the 19th century. It was later home to the KNK Fraternity of Wesleyan University. The structural system consists of load-bearing masonry with a flat roof, and materials include brick and flushboarding walls and a brownstone foundation. Significance This house was built in 1841-1842 for Edward A. Russell (1797–1874) on a portion of the Russell family estate. Edward Russell worked in the foreign mercantile trade until he returned to Middletown in 1838. He later served as mayor, state representative and national convention delegate. Edward A. Russell had personal contact with the firm of Town and Davis while supervising the building of the well-known Greek Revival Russell House (1828) for his younger brother, Samuel W. Russell. Thus it is possible that Edward retained the services of this firm when his house was built. Such a possibility is reinforced by early photographs showing the original proportions and decoration. These indicate that the house was a sophisticated and high style example of Greek Revival, and stylistically close to the DeRham Brevoort House (attributed to Davis) in New York City and \\"Highwood\\", Henry Whitney's estate in New Haven (1835–1836) by Town and Davis. Edward Russell's grand-nephew, Richard L. deZeng (1847–1932), occupied the house until his death in 1932. Wesleyan purchased the property from the administrators of the estate of E.A. Russell and then sold it to Alpha Sigma Delta Alumni Association, Inc. in 1934. At this time the structure was altered for use as a fraternity house. The heavy cornice at the top of the building was lowered to the second floor and windows were placed above the cornice to form a full third floor. Window cornices were removed and new window openings cut in the south facade. The second and third floors were divided into three room suites; however, the first floor remains largely unaltered. This house was the last example of Greek Revival architecture to be built in the prestigious area of High Street. Current use and condition The house is currently used for lectures, concerts, and other special events, and is preserved in good condition.

FCG is an open instrument that can be used by construction grammarians who want to formulate their intuitions and data in a precise way and who want to test the implications of their grammar designs for language parsing, production and learning. The formalism can be tested through an interactive web interface at the FCG website. FCG integrates many notions from contemporary computational linguistics such as feature structure and unification-based language processing, but uses them in a novel way to operationalize insights from construction grammar theory. Constructions are considered bi-directional and hence usable both for parsing and production. Processing is flexible in the sense that FCG provides meta-layer processing for coping with novelty, partially ungrammatical or incomplete sentences. FCG is called 'fluid' because it acknowledges the premise that language users constantly change and update their grammars. The research on FCG is primarily carried out by Luc Steels and his teams at the VUB AI Lab in Brussels and the Language Evolution Lab in Barcelona, and the Sony Computer Science Laboratories in Paris. Besides Steels, current and former contributors to the FCG formalism include Katrien Beuls, Paul Van Eecke, Remi van Trijp, Joris Bleys, Joachim De Beule, Martin Loetzsch, Nicolas Neubauer, Michael Spranger, Wouter Van den Broeck, Pieter Wellens, and others. Transient structure FCG treats parsing and production as a search problem, in which the FCG engine searches for the best utterance to verbalize a meaning (language production) or the best semantic network (or meaning representation) to analyze an utterance (parsing). Each state representation in the search process is called a Transient Structure. A Transient Structure can be considered as an extended feature structure, as it consists of a (flat) list of \\"units\\" that consist of a unit-name (a unique constant symbol) and a unit-body (a set of feature-value pairs). Older versions of FCG (before 2011) used to split the transient structure into two separate poles for semantics and syntax, but the current version implements a single representation for all linguistic information. Constructions FCG constructions (or technically speaking: construction schemas) are treated as the operators of the search process. That is, by applying a construction to a transient structure, a new transient structure (or state representation) in the search space may be created. Just like transient structures, constructions mostly consists of units of feature-value pairs. Constructions are however more structured because they contain two distinct parts: * A conditional part: This part of the construction specifies the conditions under which the construction may apply. Moreover, units of features that appear in the conditional part are split into a \\"comprehension lock\\" and a \\"formulation lock\\". This split is important for ensuring the bidirectional application of an FCG construction (see below). * A Contributing part: This part of the construction specifies information that the construction may add to the transient structure if the conditions for application are satisfied. Linguistic processing To decide whether a construction can apply, the conditional part is \\"matched\\" against the current transient structure using a unification-based algorithm. In production, only features that are part of the formulation locks of the construction must be matched against the transient structure; whereas in parsing, only features that are part of the comprehension locks will be considered. If a match is successful, the FCG engine will \\"merge\\" all of the units of feature-value pairs with the transient structure in a similar unification-based process. Flexibility FCG features a meta-layers of diagnostics, repairs and consolidation strategies that allow the grammar designer to implement ways to handle novelty, errors and unexpected input during processing. These diagnostics and repairs can also be used for exploring the (automated) acquisition of new constructions. References * Luc Steels (ed.) (2011). Design Patterns in Fluid Construction Grammar.

It can also be performed because of success in business or career growth; during social functions like marriages, house-warming ceremonies, naming of the children and so on. Legend This puja is first mentioned in Skanda Purana, Reva Kanda by Suta Puranik to the rishis in Naimisharanya. The details are part of the Katha (Story) that is usually read during the ritualhttp://www.mantraaonline.com/satyanarayana-puja/ A painting of Narayana (Viṣṇu) seated on lotus Sri Satya Narayana puja is a very popular ritual in most parts of India including Gujarat, Maharashtra, Assam, Bengal, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh,Telangana,Bihar, Odisha, Manipur.. The ritual is usually performed on the Full moon day of every month, Ekadashi (11th day after full moon or new moon), Kārtika Pūrṇimā, Vaiśākhā Pūrṇimā, solar eclipse day or on Saṅkrānti except during Āṣāḍha Chandra Masahttp://pujabooking.com/blog/sri- satyanarayan-vrata-puja/. It is also performed on special occasions and during times of achievements, as an offering of gratitude to the Lord. These occasions could include marriage, graduation, start of a new job, purchase of a new home, to name a few. In addition, the performance of this most auspicious puja generally confers a child to couples trying to start a familyhttp://pujabooking.com/blog/sri-satyanarayan-vrata-puja/. The Satyanarayan puja can be performed on any day for any reason. It is not a puja confined to any festivities, but Purnima (full moon day) is considered specifically auspicious for this puja. Performing this puja in the evening is considered more appropriate. However, one can perform this puja in the morning as well. This puja is very simple, can be performed by anyone, and it does not require a priest to perform it. The original concept was instructions given by rishi Narada Muni while on tour of earth he noticed tremendous amounts of sufferings all around due to malnutrition. He went to lord Vishnu and described the situation and was told with instructions to perform Pooja and the other stories to be narrated. One of the key instruction was to invite as many friends, relatives and neighbors to attend the ceremony and to feed them and to offer as many types of fruits as possible and the sufferings will be eliminated, and this was due to being well fed and consumption of fruits. Preparation The previous night, think of Lord Sri Satyanarayana and mentally decide to perform puja the next day. Invite your relatives and friends. Tradition mandates to abstain from worldly pleasures. On the puja day, early in the morning keeping the same thoughts of worshiping the Lord, take a head bath. If performing the evening, again take a head-bath. This should be done by both husband and wife. Wear a clean dress. Observe Fast (if possible). Keep all the things for puja ready, near the altar. The total duration of the puja - start to finish – will be around 3 hours. Decorate the front door with mango leaves. The place near the altar is cleaned (with cow dung, where possible). The Altar is placed in an East-West direction such that the devotees performing the puja will be seated facing east. It is decorated with floral designs, usually using rice flour and other coloured powders. A new white cloth is spread on the Altar and layered with raw rice. Peeta A Kalash (small pot made of Silver, Copper, Brass, or even earthen) is placed in the middle of Altar. That small pot should add one betel nut, one rupee coin, some jwar or wheat and then filled it with holy water like gangajal, if not available you can use clean water .A coconut is placed on top and wrapped with a cloth.5 Mango or ashok leaves are placed between the coconut and the pot. After this a red thread (kalava or moli) is tied 3 round in neck of pot . Make a symbol of swastik in pot, it is a good and positive symbol .This too is decorated with Chandan (Sandal paste) and kumkum. This process is called kalash sthapna . A framed picture of Lord Satyanarayana is placed on the far side of the Altar. Flowers and garlands can be placed on this frame. Place all the puja items near the Altar. The devotees performing the puja will be seated facing the Altar. =Prasad= The food is cooked as normal, usually rice, dal and vegetables; avoiding any non-vegetarian (egg, meat, and fish dishes) and also avoid onion and garlic. Make sure the kitchen is kept clean and devoid of impurities. The main Prasadhttp://www.satyanarayanpuja.org/satyanarayan-puja- prasad.html [offering] (is also called as Sapatha, Sheera or Sapaada Bhakshya[ಸಪಾದ ಭಕ್ಷ್ಯ]) is prepared with equal parts (usually one and one-forth parts) of sugar, Semolina, and Ghee. Popularly, it is cooked to blanch. Cardamoms, cashews, raisins, and/or bananas may be added while cooking or as garnishing. Some people avoid cooking and merely mix the ingredients together. Various regional variations exist in the way it is cooked. It also has various names - Telugu Prasadam,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9HsBZcgBto Marathi Sheera,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7vdmA2Os4 Gujarati Sheera,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lw7vdmA2Os4 Bengali Sinni,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpCrRJeKCvY Punjabi Panjiri,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXH_co9DhEY etc. The main Prasad is offered together with daily food, various fruits, and Panchamrutam (uncooked mixture of Milk, Yogurt, Ghee, Honey, and Sugar).

Rose is his preferred flower) Procedure The following procedure is as prescribed by and performed in Andhra Pradesh. Several regional and traditional variations occur as mentioned in the following section. Sri Satyanarayana Puja at home The devotee begins by purifying oneself (achamniyam) and sankalpam (a vow that the named devotee is performing the puja on such time and era, to attain such cause). The puja starts with a prayer to Gaṇesha, to remove all obstacles that may occur as a result of incorrectly performing the puja. This is done by the sixteen upacharas, chanting the names of Lord Gaṇesha and offering prasada (offering usually consisting of banana, coconut, modak, a sugar and coconut mixture, or laddu) and the showering of flowers. Subsequently, Varuna puja (kalash puja) is performed. A uniqueness of this puja is the invoking of pancha lokapalaka, navagrahas along with their companion and co-companions, and the eight dikpalakas. This totals to 40 (5+9+(9*2)+8). Each God has a vedic symbol of a unique metal. Since these are difficult to obtain by the common means, and since the modern currency coins by minted with multiple metals, each Guest God is represented by a coin. They are placed on a betel leaf. The betel nut, akshit and dry dates are the offerings. Thus, the requirement of 40 coins, betel leaves and dry dates. The main puja commences with the worship to Lord Satyanarayana. The idol (or coin) of Lord Satyanarayana is bathed and cleaned with panchamritam. After placing the deity in the correct position, 1008 names of Sri Satyanarayana are chanted. This is followed by offering of Prasada and flowers (Mantra Pushpam). Satya Nārāṇaya Pooja Another requirement of the puja is that the story be heard among all those observing and partaking in the puja.http://umasreeraghunath.blogspot.com/2011/11/benefits-of-performing- sri.html The five-part story involves the origin of the puja, benefits of the puja, the potential mishaps that may occur with the forgetting performance of the puja, the magnitude of the Lord's benevolence and the importance of the Prasad, and consequences of snubbing the ritual.http://www.angelfire.com/pa3/payalvinod/sai.html The puja concludes with an Aarti http://pujabooking.com/aarti-collection/god-aarti/shri- satyanarayan-ji-ki-aarti/, which consists of lighting camphor in the vicinity of an image of the Lord. After the puja is over, participants and observers of the puja are required to partake the prasad that was offered and blessed by the Lord. =Regional and Traditional Variations= * Many places the Varuna/ Kalash puja is done while invoking Ganesh at the start of the puja. * The number of Athitis (divine guests) invoked varies substantially. Thus, the number of coins and betel leaves count varies. Sri Satyanarayana Swami Katha An essential part of this puja is listening to the Sri Satyanarayana Swami Katha (narrative).http://annavaramdevasthanam.nic.in/history.htm The five-part story involves the origin of the puja, benefits of the puja, the potential mishaps that may occur with the forgetting performance of the puja, the magnitude of the Lord's benevolence and the importance of the Prasad, and consequences of snubbing the ritual.http://www.puja.net/Pages/Yagyas/Journal/04Events/Satyanarayana/SatyaPuja.htm Chapter 1 narrates the origins of the puja. Sri Satyanarayana Katha comes from the Skanda Puraṇa, Reva khaṇḍa.http://www.mantraaonline.com/satyanarayana- puja/ Suta Maharṣhi is the one narrating this account to Saunaka Muni, in Naimiṣaraṇya to the ṛiṣhis who were performing a thousand-year yajna for the benefit of humanity. The procedure itself was narrated my Sriman Narayana to Narada. Chapter 2 narrates the benefits of the puja. A poor Brahmin was approached by Lord Himself in disguise and He advised him of the puja. Upon successful completion of the puja, the Brahmin could overcome his difficulties and enjoy eternal bliss. It also narrates about the good fortune of a woodcutter who witnesses the Brahmin performing the puja and continues to gain prosperity after performing the puja. Chapter 3 narrates the mishaps that may occur for dishonoring the vow to perform the puja. A merchant, with an intention to establish family, vows to perform the puja upon having a child. He adjourns the vow to complete it during the child's marriage. Upon forgetting the vow, the Lord puts the merchant in hardship. The merchant is falsely accused and imprisoned. His entire business is confiscated by the king. His household goes bankrupt. He is freed when his wife recollects the promise and performs the puja. Chapter 4 narrates about the Lord's benevolence and the importance of the Prasad. This is a continuation of the previous chapter. During an incident, the merchant puts off the Lord about his merchandise, thereby losing all its value. Realizing his folly, the merchant regrets his intemperance and seeks forgiveness. On hearing that the merchant reached the dockyard, his wife and daughter, who were performing the puja at that time, forget to take the Prasad. Angered with the disrespect, He makes the boats sink into the sea, only to be restored when they have the Prasad. Chapter 5 narrates about the importance of the puja and not that of the devotees. A group of backwoodsmen was performing the puja. King discards and disregards the offerings, thereby invoking the wrath of Sri Satyanarayana. The king loses his kingdom, wealth, and family, only to be restored upon realizing his recklessness and seeking forgiveness to Sri Satyanarayana and accepting the offerings.

The group was assigned to the 3d Bomb Wing and flew B-26B/C Marauders. Operational squadrons of the 387th were: * 556th Bombardment Squadron (FW) * 557th Bombardment Squadron (KS) * 558th Bombardment Squadron (KX) * 559th Bombardment Squadron (TQ) The 387th Bomb Group began combat on 15 August 1943 by joining with three other B-26 groups attacking coastal defences on the French Coast near Boulogne, and was mounted in thick fog. In common with other Marauder units of the 3d Bomb Wing, the 387th was transferred to Ninth Air Force on 16 October 1943. The 387th Bomb Group moved to RAF Stoney Cross in Hampshire on 21 July 1944 when Ninth Air Force moved the 98th Bomb Wing's four Marauder groups into the New Forest area at the earliest opportunity to place them closer to the French Normandy Invasion beaches. During September 1944, the airfield was used temporarily by IX Troop Carrier Command as advanced C-47 base during Operation Market-Garden. 61st Troop Carrier Group Troop carrier squadrons of the 61st Troop Carrier Group used the airfield on 24 March 1945, carrying British paratroops as part of Operation Varsity, the airborne crossing of the Rhine River, who dropped near Wesel. The Americans handed the airfield over to the RAF in April 1945, and it was in the hands of the British Army and RAF Technical Training Command until the end of the war. =Post war= In 1946 use was made of the airfield, now named Willingale, by the Straight Corporation. They established a branch of the Home Counties Flying Club here, and Straight Aviation Training Ltd operated a fleet of Avro Anson navigation trainers here from 1946 to 1948. A few private aircraft were also based here, but the airfield was closed on 28 February 1959. Most of Chipping Ongar airfield reverted to agricultural use. One of the large T-2 Hangars was dismantled and re-erected at North Weald airfield. It is believed to be the one nearest the M11 motorway, and now used as a freight forwarding warehouse. A section of the perimeter track and some loop dispersal hardstands are still intact, connected to a small private landing strip converted from a straight section of the wartime perimeter, aligned 04/22, and one small section of a secondary full-width runway (09/27) on the southeast side . On the northeastern side, the Operations block, Norden Bombsight Store, and the base of the pilots' briefing room are grouped together, and are in quite good condition . As of 2020 Fyfield Flying Club operates from a small part of the old airfield. See also * List of former Royal Air Force stations References =Citations= =Bibliography= * Freeman, Roger A.

Its seat is located in the city of San Juan, capital of the province of the same name, in the Cuyo region. It was founded in 1973, based on several local institutions and a faculty of the National University of Cuyo. Institutions The National University of San Juan includes the following faculties: * Engineering * Philosophy, Humanities and Arts * Architecture, Urbanization and Design * Social Sciences * Exact, Physical and Natural Sciences These provide a wide array of titles, including tecnicaturas (intermediate), licenciaturas (Bachelor's degrees), professorships, and post-graduate courses. Research activity is conducted through the postgraduate departments of each faculty. Moreover, The University has 14 Research Institutes in which primary research activities are conducted. History The origin of UNSJ was a Preparatory College founded in 1839 by then-governor (then president of Argentina) Domingo Faustino Sarmiento. The faculty of Mineralogy of this college gave rise to the technical School of Mines, which in turn fathered other teaching institutions. In 1939 the National University of Cuyo (UNCuyo) was founded with its seat in Mendoza, and San Juan Province was included in its area of influence; UNCuyo's Faculty of Engineering started functioning in San Juan in 1947. Also in that year, courses to form professors in Sciences and Letters began at the Sarmiento Normal School. These courses were split from the school, to be dictated at the newly created National Institute of the Secondary School Professorship, in 1958. During the 1960s, the society of San Juan Province strived to achieve the creation of a national university. In 1968 a programme to create new state universities did not include San Juan, but renewed demands led to a feasibility study. The National University of San Juan was created by Law 20367, signed by de facto President Alejandro Agustín Lanusse, on 10 May 1973. It grew to integrate the National Institute of the Secondary School Professorship, the Faculty of Engineering, Exact, Physical and Natural Sciences formerly dependent on the National University of Cuyo, and the Domingo F. Sarmiento Provincial University. The full fusion of these institutions was completed on 10 October. References * Universidad Nacional de San Juan — Institutional website.

While in many countries land banking may refer to various private real estate investment schemes, in the United States it refers to the establishment of quasi-governmental county or municipal authorities purposed with managing an inventory of surplus land. Municipal land banks in the United States =Definition= Blighted land in Philadelphia Land banks are quasi-governmental entities created by counties or municipalities to effectively manage and repurpose an inventory of underused, abandoned, or foreclosed property. They are often chartered to have powers that enable them to accomplish these goals in ways that existing government agencies can not. While the land bank \\"model\\" has gained broad support and has been implemented in a number of cities, they are implemented differently so as to best address both municipal needs and the state and local legal context in which they were created. =History= Land banking originated in the 1920s and 1930s as means of making low-priced land available for housing and ensuring orderly development. The period of deindustrialization in the United States coupled with increased suburbanization in the middle of the 20th century left many American cities with large amounts of vacant and blighted industrial, residential, and commercial property. Beginning in the early 1970s municipalities began to seek solutions to manage decline or spur revitalization in once prosperous city neighborhoods. The first land bank was created in St. Louis in 1971. While additional municipalities continued to adopt them at a trickle it wasn’t until the mid 2000s that land banks became viewed as a tested, reliable, and accepted model and experienced widespread implementation – particularly after the success of the Genesee County Land Bank. In 2009 the Department of Housing and Urban Development issued a report embracing land banks as a best practices model for municipalities dealing with the effects of the real estate market collapse of the 2007 financial crisis and the ensuing foreclosure crisis. Investment land banking by country =United Kingdom= Land banking in the UK was previously the preserve of the landed gentry or real estate developers. Many reputable listed commercial building companies engage successfully in land banking for future building projects. Companies also purchase land sites and easily divide them into smaller plots, then offer these plots for sale to individual investors. This relatively new practice in the UK does not fall under the control of the Financial Conduct Authority. Many people are wary of this form of investment as many plot-based land banking companies have failed or been closed down. There are currently no audited successes recorded for UK plot-based land banking despite the UK having gone through a major property boom in between 2002 and 2007. A landbanking scheme that is a Collective investment scheme is a \\"regulated activity\\" for the purposes of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and, according to section 19(1), may only be operated in the UK by a person who is either authorised or exempt. Section 26 provides that an agreement made by a person in contravention of this is unenforceable and any sums paid to him may be recovered together with compensation for any loss suffered. After recent FCA enforcement of this regulation, many companies selling UK land plots have moved outside of the European Union and only offer land plots to non-UK residents who are not protected by FCA regulations. Companies offering land banking plots in the UK Since the changes in the land registration act, a number of companies offering UK land plots as an investment have been formed. Typically this land is greenbelt, nature conservation, flood plain, agricultural or protected land unsuitable for development. There are no recorded successful planning permission applications for plots sold under such collective investment schemes. There have been considerable losses recorded by investors in UK land plot investment schemes. A large number of British companies offering UK land plots have failed or been shut down by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) or other authorities. Some companies have now moved offshore after FSA investigation. Some companies now offer UK land plots from locations such as Dubai or Singapore where the local authorities do not regulate such activities, or are not aware of the high risk nature of the investment. In June 2010 the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) issued a warning on land banking plots schemes warning they may be a scam with specific focus on companies offering land from the UK and Canada. Sales methods A company representative may contact an individual by telephone, in temporary shopping center booths, or at property shows and offer a strategic land investment in the UK. Very often UK government or industry statistics, the proximity of the land to built up areas, or the recent history of UK house prices are quoted as a demonstration of why the land plot is a great investment. Verbal communication will often indicate that the land is fast tracked for building approval and has strong potential as building land. When pricing the land reference is typically made to approved building land prices at the market peak. Very often the land banking company will present detailed plans showing a housing development on the site. These plans are often referred to as \\"pre-approved\\", \\"concept\\" or \\"predevelopment\\". The sales person will focus on the potential future value of the land against the current selling price. No reference is ever made to the value of green belt or agricultural land, or the issues involved with the long term maintenance, and collectively selling tiny plots of land. The sales price is typically uplifted 10–100 times over the current value of the land. Plans shown have no validity in UK planning law and cannot be considered as any indication of progress in the planning process. No written contractual promise is ever given for planning permission despite typically extreme optimism by the sales person. The sales person will typically never mention that the land is protected, or greenbelt land and cannot be developed under current planning regulations. There is typically no possibility of planning permission in any reasonable timeframe. The investor may end up paying a considerable amount of money for a small area of low value land which has a very high risk of standing undeveloped. Once the general public becomes aware of the lack of viability of the proposed plot investment scheme, the re-sale value of the individual plots collapses. This is typically followed by the land plot company liquidating completely, or relocating to another legal jurisdiction. For customers that show a willingness to purchase such schemes there may also be attempts to sell additional plot based land banking products at alternate locations, or other high yield investment programmes. Customers may also be added to suckers lists which are then sold to other companies offering similar schemes. When the land banking plot company fails plot investors may also be offered investment recovery or planning services for a fee. Such services typically are fraudulent or fail and lead to a further loss of money for the investor. Controversies A You and Yours documentary, first aired on BBC Radio 4 in December 2006, criticized the services offered by many land banking companies in the United Kingdom, suggesting that they were scamming their customers. A land banking scam is based on the very low chance of any of the plots receiving planning permission and the very high profit margins taken on the land plots, with the seller using misleading marketing tactics to convince the buyers that they are making a sound investment. A key strategy used for selling United Kingdom land plots is to imply that because a customer owns the land plot, they cannot lose their money. The land banking company typically suggests dramatic annual increases in the value of the land plots, and a very optimistic time frame for successful planning applications. These are never contractually committed. Typically the land banking company sells a land plot at a premium of 15 to 100 times the current market value of undeveloped land. A purchaser might pay £15,000 for a land plot that only has a current market value of £500. On this basis, most of the investment is not in land, and the small percentage annual increases in the value of the land plot are meaningless. The actual investment is in a proposed service to deliver valuable approved building land in the future. If that service is never delivered or is not successful, the remaining land asset is normally worthless. Should the selling company fail or disappear, the plot owner cannot economically sell the plot, as the administrative effort and cost of sale typically exceeds the value of the land plot. Many land banking companies target victims outside of the United Kingdom, particularly Canada, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei and Malaysia. Residents of these countries may be naive of the UK property market and local planning regulations such as green belt zoning. In 2008, the land banking firm UKLI was placed into administration due to insolvency, despite having taken £69 million from 4,500 people for land plots. Land International was closed down in 2008 after losing investors £10 million, and the same Land International plots were later offered for sale in Asia. In 2010, Land International (Far East) failed, causing investors to lose S$6 million (£2.5M).200 lose $6m in British land deals MP David Heath requested a debate in the House of Commons following the offering of 209 plots in the village of Dean, saying that \\"while land banking may not be illegal it is undoubtedly a scam\\". The UK Land Registry issued a press release on January 15, 2009 advising consumers that the Land Registry has published a guide warning against land banking investment schemes. Land Registry Head of Corporate Legal Services Mike Westcott Rudd said that the public were being \\"misled about the prospects of obtaining planning permission\\", with well-known banks and developers being falsely cited as partners in the project, and that in some cases forged Land Registry paperwork was being presented to suggest that planning approval existed where it did not. As a result of the significant controversy and media coverage land banking received, many directors and officials of companies involved where prosecuted and handed custodial sentence by the courts. =United States= Government Syracuse Land Bank sign, Syracuse, New York In 2011 New York State passed a land bank statute authorizing the establishment of nonprofits in each county to take title to vacant abandoned homes so they can be rehabilitated, sold or demolished in an orderly fashion. Many counties upstate including Erie County, Onondaga County, Schenectady County and Albany County have abandoned homes as people moved to the suburbs. Some properties have been abandoned due to back taxes and the city has taken title.Land Bank Act Article 16 The recent robo- signing settlement gave Attorney General Eric Schneiderman the wherewithal to fund land banks in Schenectady and Albany. The state of Michigan also has a land bank program. Ohio passed land bank legislation in 2009. Commercial Land banking as an investment is nothing new to America. Several self-made billionaires started by purchasing large tracts in California where the development opportunities had not yet arisen. People such as Bob Hope and Donald Trump have reaped tremendous reward from buying large areas and holding the property until the market commanded a considerable return when sold. There have however, also been many land scams in the US, such as the large areas of Florida swampland which were sold as being suitable for real estate. Florida land scams have history as far back as the 1920s Florida Land Rush. Many Florida Counties have traces of these land scams today. Polk County Florida in particular has been devastated with land banking scams. Polk County, being the land that lies between the city of Tampa, in Hillsborough County Florida and the city of Orlando, in Orange County Florida has been a hot bed for speculative land development. North Polk County falls within the lower Green Swamp. The State of Florida has declared the Green Swamp \\"land of critical state concern\\". During the 1970s through the late 1980s the Green Swamp was sold as being suitable for real estate development. The development of Disney World and the attraction it received was the sales tool to persuade individuals to buy one acre lots at high speculative prices. These prices ranged from $2,000 to as high as $15,000 per acre. The Florida land banking scams continue today and are mostly operated outside of the United States. Unwary foreign customers are sold Florida land from outside the U.S. borders through contracts for deed arrangements. =Australia= In December 2008, at the depths of the Global Financial Crisis, the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) relaxed laws regarding foreign investment in Australian real estate. Under previous legislation temporary residents were only allowed to purchase a property for Principal Place of Residence purposes valued at up to $300,000. Under new laws active since February 2009, this monetary limit has been removed. In March 2010, the Reserve Bank of Australia governor announced that it is monitoring the effect of the rule change on the housing market. On April 24, 2010, Assistant Treasurer Senator Nick Sherry announced the tightening of foreign investment laws as a result of a public backlash to the changes made a year earlier. Whilst they are still entitled to purchase a property of any value, temporary Residents must now sell their residence upon leaving the country, and must report all purchases to the Foreign Investment Review Board, effectively eliminating this land banking loophole. However, foreign companies are allowed to purchase property to house local staff. It is possible for foreign individuals to create a registered company for the sole purpose of purchasing property in Australia and actively bypass the loophole fix. As of April 20, 2010, the COAG has agreed the Housing Supply and Affordability Reform Working Party will extend the land audit work to examine ‘underused examine private holdings of large parcels of land by mid-2010. Agricultural land banking Paraguay Chaco. While most land banking is based on the prospect of urban areas expanding at the expense of rural areas, in various parts of the world agricultural land is expanding at the expense of virgin land. The purchase of virgin land that has been identified as suitable for agriculture because of its climate, topography and soil properties, where the buyer has no intention to work the land himself or lease it out, would be agricultural land banking. Such lands are often rather far away from existing infrastructure when purchased by the land banking investor, therefore prices being low. The investor anticipates that, because of the area's natural productive potential, an agricultural infrastructure (sufficient roads, specialised contractors, grain storages) will develop, with more land put under cultivation and land values multiplying. Agricultural land banking is found where large tracts of fertile virgin land still exist, where valuations are low and where legislation allows large land holdings (free hold) by domestic and foreign investors. Typical countries for such investments during recent years have been Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay where land prices appreciated accordingly. Though the perception that the world's fertile land is a limited and valuable asset is by no means new, it received renewed public and media attention with the global food crisis, when phrases like peak wheat or peak soil were coined.

Genetics: From Genes to Genomes. New York: McGraw-Hill. Suppressor mutations are useful for identifying new genetic sites which affect a biological process of interest. They also provide evidence between functionally interacting molecules and intersecting biological pathways.Hodgkin J. Genetic suppression. 2005 Dec 27. In: WormBook: The Online Review of C. elegans Biology [Internet]. Pasadena (CA): WormBook; 2005-. Intragenic vs. intergenic suppression =Intragenic suppression= Intragenic suppression results from suppressor mutations that occur in the same gene as the original mutation. In a classic study, Francis Crick (et al.) used intragenic suppression to study the fundamental nature of the genetic code. From this study it was shown that genes are expressed as non-overlapping triplets (codons). Researchers showed that mutations caused by either a single base insertion (+) or a single base deletion (-) could be \\"suppressed\\" or restored by a second mutation of the opposite sign, as long as the two mutations occurred in the same vicinity of the gene. This led to the conclusion that genes needed to be read in a specific \\"reading frame\\" and a single base insertion or deletion would shift the reading frame (frameshift mutation) in such a way that the remaining DNA would code for a different polypeptide than the one intended. Therefore, researchers concluded that the second mutation of opposite sign suppresses the original mutation by restoring the reading frame, as long as the portion between the two mutations is not critical for protein function. In addition to the reading frame, Crick also used suppressor mutations to determine codon size. It was found that while one and two base insertions/deletions of the same sign resulted in a mutant phenotype, deleting or inserting three bases could give a wild type phenotype. From these results it was concluded that an inserted or deleted triplet does not disturb the reading frame and the genetic code is in fact a triplet. =Intergenic suppression= Intergenic (also known as extragenic) suppression relieves the effects of a mutation in one gene by a mutation somewhere else within the genome. The second mutation is not on the same gene as the original mutation. Intergenic suppression is useful for identifying and studying interactions between molecules, such as proteins. For example, a mutation which disrupts the complementary interaction between protein molecules may be compensated for by a second mutation elsewhere in the genome that restores or provides a suitable alternative interaction between those molecules. Several proteins of biochemical, signal transduction, and gene expression pathways have been identified using this approach. Examples of such pathways include receptor-ligand interactions as well as the interaction of components involved in DNA replication, transcription, and translation. Tevenphage Suppressor mutations also occur in genes that code for virus structural proteins. To create a viable phage T4 virus (see image), a balance of structural components is required. An amber mutant of phage T4 contains a mutation that changes a codon for an amino acid in a protein to the nonsense stop codon TAG (see stop codon and nonsense mutation). If, upon infection, an amber mutant defective in a gene encoding a needed structural component of phage T4 is weakly suppressed (in an E. coli host containing a specific altered tRNA – see nonsense suppressor), it will produce a reduced number of the needed structural component. As a consequence few if any viable phage are formed. However, it was found that viable phage could sometimes be produced in the host with the weak nonsense suppressor if a second amber mutation in a gene that encodes another structural protein is also present in the phage genome. It was found that the reason the second amber mutation could suppress the first one is that the two numerically reduced structural proteins would now be in balance. For instance, if the first amber mutation caused a reduction of tail fibers to one tenth the normal level, most phage particles produced would have insufficient tail fibers to be infective. However, if a second amber mutation is defective in a base plate component and causes one tenth the number of base plates to be made, this may restore the balance of tail fibers and base plates, and thus allow infective phage to be produced. Revertant In microbial genetics, a revertant is a mutant that has reverted to its former genotype or to the original phenotype by means of a suppressor mutation, or else by compensatory mutation somewhere in the gene (second site reversion).

It is also known as the indoor city (ville intérieure), as not all of it is underground. With over of tunnels spread over an area of , the 60 residential and commercial complexes comprise of floor space, including 80% of all office space and 35% of all commercial space in downtown Montreal. Services include shopping malls, hotels, banks, offices, museums, universities, seven metro stations, two commuter train stations, a bus terminal and the Bell Centre hockey arena. There are more than 120 exterior access points to the underground city. Some 500,000 people use the underground city every day, especially to escape the traffic and/or Montreal's harsh winter. Olympic Park Olympic Stadium, in the city's eastern section The Olympic installations site is next to Metro Pie-IX and Metro Viau, from downtown in the Hochelaga-Maisonneuve district, and consists of several buildings designed by French architect Roger Taillibert. The Olympic Stadium is ovoid shaped with a distinctive 'ribbed' look, and has the world's tallest inclined tower at high; it leans at 45 degrees. The complex includes the Montreal Biodome (originally a fully functional Velodrome), the Montreal Insectarium, municipal golf course Le Village, and the Montreal Botanical Garden, one of the largest botanical gardens in the world, second only to Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in England. Two pyramidal towers, known as the Olympic Village, were built to house athletes but now serve as apartments and offices. The Montreal 1976 Summer Olympics were successful, but construction problems and corruption created a massive financial burden for citizens. At the opening, the tower and the retractable roof were incomplete. The tower was completed years later but the retractable roof was never completed as originally planned by Taillibert. Anglo locals refer to the stadium as the \\"Big O\\" due to its shape, but also as the \\"Big Owe\\" -- a reference to the Olympic Park's exorbitant total cost, which was only paid off thirty years later with the help of a special tobacco tax. The stadium was also home to the Expos from 1977 until the team moved to Washington, D.C. after the 2004 season, and has sometimes been home for the Montreal Alouettes. Today, Montreal's Olympic Park hosts limited professional sports events and is mainly a tourist and cultural attraction. Montreal hosted the 2006 1st World Outgames holding the opening/closing ceremonies and many of the events at the Olympic Stadium. The event drew over 10,000 participants. Most were Gay athletes, but many participated in other cultural events such as ballroom dancing. Opening ceremonies brought international athletes, local politicians, and entertainers. Museums and cultural centres Redpath Museum Montreal is the centre of Quebec culture and a major centre of Canadian culture in general. It has many specialized museums such as the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts (MMFA), the Musée d'art contemporain (MAC), the Redpath Museum, the Stewart Museum, the McCord Museum of Canadian History, and the Canadian Centre for Architecture. The Place des Arts cultural complex houses the MAC and several theatres, and is the seat of the Montreal Opera and the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, although the latter is slated to receive a new concert hall adjacent to Place des Arts. The Museum Quarter’s historical and architectural richness, spilling over into surrounding streets, creates a special ambiance that leaves a lasting impression on visitors. Crescent, de la Montagne and Sherbrooke Streets are the hub of the district’s vibrant business life. High-end, designer fashion and décor boutiques, international shops, art galleries, jewellers and exquisite fine dining never fail to win visitors over. Churches and other religious buildings Saint Joseph's Oratory is the largest church in Canada. Nicknamed \\"la ville aux cent clochers\\" (the city of a hundred belltowers), Montreal is renowned for its churches. As described by Mark Twain, \\"This is the first time I was ever in a city where you couldn't throw a brick without breaking a church window.\\" The city has four Roman Catholic basilicas: Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral, the aforementioned Notre-Dame Basilica, St. Patrick's Basilica, and Saint Joseph's Oratory. The Oratory is the largest church in Canada, with the largest dome of its kind in the world after that of Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome. Other well-known churches include the pilgrimage church of Notre-Dame-du-Bon-Secours, which is sometimes called the Sailors' Church, the Church of St. Michael and St. Anthony, known for its Byzantine architecture, and the Anglican Christ Church Cathedral, which was completely excavated and suspended in mid-air during the construction of part of the Underground City. All of the above are major tourist destinations, particularly Notre-Dame and the Oratory. An impressive number of other churches, synagogues and mosques can be found, and church steeples are a familiar view all over the city and island.  Green Spaces in Montreal  The city’s public green spaces are categorized as major urban parks, neighborhood parks, city squares, and nature parks. Parks offer recreational, educational, historical, and cultural programming aimed at engaging Montrealers in the outdoors, nature, and fitness. Park activities vary seasonally, and each park features its own unique programming. The city’s large parks account for approximately 2,000 hectares of the island’s land. The Ville de Montreal also considers cemeteries, certain golf courses, and green alleys as green spaces. Green spaces improve air quality, reduce the effect of urban heat islands, contribute to residents’ quality of life, preserve biodiversity, and improve the city’s aesthetic. The city is also home to small scale neighborhood green spaces, such as green alleys and community gardens. Below is a list of Montreal’s public green spaces: = Major urban parks = Mount Royal Mount Royal is Montreal's outstanding urban park, designed in 1876 by Frederick Law Olmsted, best known as the designer of New York's Central Park. Mount Royal's features include the Chalet and the Kondiaronk Belvedere overlooking downtown Montreal (the most famous view of the city), and man-made Beaver Lake (Lac aux Castors) with its recently renovated pavilion. Mount Royal is topped by an illuminated cross that has become a Montreal landmark.Beaver Lake (Lac aux castors), Mount Royal.Observant hikers on the park's many trails will find an abundance of small wildlife. In the winter, the park is the site of numerous cross-country ski trails and a new, refrigerated skating rink near Beaver Lake.Beaver Lake (Lac aux castors), Mount Royal.Once, a funicular railroad brought sightseers to its peak, but has long since disappeared. A tramway also went up the mountain on the north side, replaced in the late 1950s by the Camillien Houde Parkway, which now bisects the mountain (the parkway is named for long-time but controversial former mayor, jailed during World War II for his opposition to conscription in Canada). The \\"11-Montagne\\" bus line perpetuates the route of the tram. Every Sunday in the summer, hundreds of people gather at the George-Étienne Cartier Monument, a statue of Confederation co-founder George-Étienne Cartier at the foot of Mount Royal, for several hours of drumming, dancing, and juggling (among many other activities) in an event known as the Tam-Tams. It is unclear how this event started; but, as it has no formal organization and has carried on both in a lively and peaceful way since at least the late 1980s. The intersection of Avenue du Parc and Avenue des Pins, just to the south, formerly a winding urban interchange (inspired by the New York parkways of Robert Moses), underwent a major transformation to become more pedestrian- friendly. * Parc La Fontaine * Parc Jarry * Parc Maisonneuve * Esplanade of the Olympic Park * Parc Angrignon Neighborhood parks: * Parc Jean Mance * Parc Sir Wilfrid-Laurier * Parc Outremont * Square Sir-George-Etienne-Cartier * Parc Notre-Dame-de-Grace * Promenade Bellerive City squares: * Place Émilie Gamelin * Place de la Paix * Phillips Square * Square Saint-Louis * Square Victoria * Dorchester Square - Place du Canada * Place d’Armes Nature parks: * Lachine Canal Historical Site * Parc des Rapides * Parc National des Îles-de- Boucherville * Parc-Nature du Cap-Sainte-Jaques * Parc-nature de l'Île -de-la- Visitation * Parc-nature du Bois-de-Liesse * Parc-nature de la Pointe-aux- Prairies * Frédérick-Back Park * Parc Jean-Drapeau Man by Alexander Calder at Île Sainte-Hélène Located in the middle of the St. Lawrence River, Parc Jean- Drapeau consists of the islands of Sainte-Hélène and the manmade Notre-Dame, which hosted Expo 67. A large green space with diverse attractions and events, Parc Jean-Drapeau is accessible by métro, car, bicycle or boat. The islands are a popular destination for Montrealers due to their green spaces and sports and cultural activities. Île Notre-Dame The Floralies gardens are located at the centre of the island. Île Notre-Dame also has a network of canals, and, further west at the lake, offers a beach and other water sports. The Casino de Montréal and a youth hostel are also located here. The Montreal Grand Prix takes place here at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, which in winter is used as a skating rink. Île Sainte-Hélène Dominated by the geodesic dome of the Biosphère and the rollercoasters of Six Flags La Ronde, the island is also home to the Hélène de Champlain restaurant and the De Lévis tower. Built in 1814, the Fort on Saint Helen's Island houses the Stewart Museum, dedicated to the history of New France. The island also contains several large public works of art, such as the imposing \\"Man\\", sculpted in steel by artist Alexander Calder. Buses run every 15 minutes from the Jean-Drapeau metro station to La Ronde. = History = Montreal’s driving force behind the creation of green spaces was inspired by the “City Beautiful” movement of the nineteenth century. This led for many parks to be underway for development, producing green spaces that held a mix of picturesque, English-style gardens and the North American “City Beautiful” movement trend. By the second half of the nineteenth century, Montreal completed building Parc La Fontaine, Parc Jean Drapeau and Parc du Mont-Royal which filled the city spaces, overall attracting more tourists to the area. As many parks and green spaces were constructed in Montreal, it became evident that the Western parts of the island had more parks in comparison to the Eastern areas, which suffer lower socioeconomic status. For example, Westmount is a wealthy anglophone neighbourhood with 12 parks and 22 green spaces. In comparison, areas such as LaSalle and East of Montreal were identified as having less green spaces and higher vulnerabilities. Beautifying Montreal through the construction of green spaces was seen as a symbol of economic progress and financial health. Those who built the parks believed that the improvement in the appearance of the city would create social order along with the moral betterment of urban dwellers. However, as the city grew in both size and in population, Montrealers began to lose interest in protecting their parks until 1970, when the Montreal Urban Community (MUC) was formed and park conservation options were considered. This led to the MUC to invest over $100 million on creating additional green spaces, which resulted in more than 600 hectares of new parks. Today, the city is known for spending the most on construction and design of green spaces in comparison to all other Canadian cities. = Issues and controversies = Green spaces in Montreal have also been a place of conflict. In a series of policy decisions called the “Morality Cuts”, which targeted the LGBTQ2S+ community in the 1950s, Montreal mayor Jean Drapeau famously ordered for hundreds of trees in Mont Royal park to be cut down to deter gay cruising activity. The clear cutting not only changed the look of the landscape but also introduced invasive species to the area, which continue to disturb the ecology of Mont Royal park today. However, issues surrounding green space in Montreal do not only exist in the past, and controversy continues to this day. Urbanization on the island of Montreal has been detrimental to the protection and upkeep of green space. The expansion of road networks throughout the early 2000s, specifically Autoroute 440, affected at least five separate green parks in the Île Bizard region. Green spaces that exist today are also not evenly distributed across the Montreal landscape. There is a concentration of green spaces in the middle of the island –near the downtown core and surrounding neighbourhoods– but there exists a clear lack of parks available to the residents of the Eastern region of Montreal. There have also been past issues with securing municipal and provincial funding to buy and protect green spaces on the island of Montreal. In the 2002 budget year, the government set aside only $1.5 million dollars over three years for acquiring new green spaces and protecting existing parks in the city. While there have been more recent investments in green spaces and talks of buying land on the West Island to make a large park, some of the area is privately owned and cannot be fully protected. = Future developments = The future of green spaces in Montreal appears to be promising, but there are issues that showcase conflicts in the city’s future initiatives. The creation of a 3,000-hectare park in the northwest corner of Montreal, le Grand Parc de l’Ouest, is the city’s largest green space development, and will incorporate five nature reserves that will be connected through forests, wetlands, and trails. Despite the praise it has received from environmentalists, it has also been criticized for its location in the higher-income west side, where parks are easily accessible to its residents. The city has adopted the Protection and Enhancement of Natural Space, an ongoing policy since 2004, that will address the disparity in green space availability between east and west by focusing on parks such as the Saint Jacques Escarpment and the East Island Greenbelt. Plans for the future of the Saint Jacques Escarpment belong to the larger Turcot Yards project. In shifting thehighway north, the city freed up space for a 2 km long park with a bicycle path, as well as green walkways to connect Notre Dame de Grace with other neighbourhoods that were inaccessible before. Again, to promote accessibility, Montreal’s Mayor announced a budget of $18 million for shoreline redevelopment for 11 boroughs on both east and west ends. This new project seeks to increase neighbourhood access to waterfront public spaces, by constructing new piers, expanding shorelines, and using these new areas to create green spaces. The Mayor also announced the revitalization of the east-end’s Parc La Fontaine, by transforming the current road that divides the park into a pedestrian walkway, renovating the park’s theatre, and cleaning up its pond. Although Montreal suffers from an east-west disparity in green spaces, it is demonstrating its commitment in diminishing this gap through the initiatives it has planned for the new decade.

He made important contributions to the study of minerals, especially in the field of crystallography. Life and career E. S. Dana was born in New Haven, Connecticut, the son of the geologist and mineralogist James Dwight Dana. He graduated from Yale College in 1870, where he had been a member of Scroll and Key, and then after two years with George J. Brush at the Sheffield Scientific School, spent another two years studying in Heidelberg and Vienna, specializing in crystal optics and crystallography. He then returned to Yale to take his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees. He was a member of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was appointed assistant professor of natural philosophy and astronomy at Yale in 1879 and then became professor of physics. His research and publishing was mainly in the field of mineralogy. Dana became an editor of the American Journal of Science in 1875 and continued to direct it until 1926. In 1884 was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences. In 1885 he was made a trustee of the Peabody Museum of Yale. He was an elected member of scientific societies in Austria, Mexico, Russia, England, Scotland, and across the United States. Personal memoir From the Memorial by William F. Ford, published in American Mineralogist, 1936 :Many American mineralogists at one time or another came into personal contact with Dana. They were familiar with his great charm, his unfailing good humor, his modesty and his delight in being able to offer assistance. He was the most delightful and entertaining companion, full of a quiet humor and ready with an appropriate story or reminiscence. Until very recently he was physically vigorous and delighted in long walks and climbs both about New Haven and among the hills of Mount Desert Island where he had his summer home. For years he was accustomed to ride about the streets of New Haven on a bicycle, and only relinquished the habit when his family protested that his age and the increase in motor traffic made the practice too dangerous. He probably owned an overcoat but the present writer cannot recall ever having seen him wear one. His only concession to winter weather was the occasional wearing of a light sweater under the coat of his suit. With his death Yale and New Haven have lost one of the last of the old-time gentleman scholars who contributed so largely to their fame. Publications Dana's two most important publications were his Textbook of Mineralogy (1877) and the monumental sixth edition of his father's System of Mineralogy (1892).

Albert Lansburgh portrait circa 1915 Gustave Albert Lansburgh (January 7, 1876 – April 1969) was an American architect largely known for his work on luxury cinemas and theaters. He was the principal architect of theaters on the West Coast from 1900 to 1930. Life and career Lansburgh was born in Panama and raised largely in San Francisco. After graduating from that city's Boys High School in 1894, Lansburgh enrolled in the University of California, Berkeley. While a student there, he worked part-time in the offices of prominent San Francisco architect Bernard Maybeck. Upon graduation, he moved to Paris, where in 1901, he was enrolled in the prestigious École des Beaux- Arts, earning a diploma in March 1906. Lansburgh returned to the Bay Area in May 1906, one month after the region had been devastated by the San Francisco earthquake and subsequent fires. First in partnership with Bernard Julius Joseph for two years, then in his own practice, Lansburgh designed numerous buildings in the recovering city. Among these were four of the seven Carnegie branch libraries for the city [Mission (1915); Sunset (1918); North Beach (1921); and Presidio (1921)] and his first theater, for the San Francisco–based Orpheum Theater Circuit. In his long career thereafter, Lansburgh become known primarily as a theater architect, designing more than 50 of them, many for the Orpheum Circuit and its successor firm, RKO. He continued to design other buildings, including Oakland's Temple Sinai in 1914.Rosenbaum, Fred (2009). Cosmopolitans: A Social and Cultural History of the Jews of the San Francisco Bay Area. University of California Press. p. 89. He also collaborated with local architects A. M. Edelman and John C. Austin on the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, and with Arthur Brown Jr. on the War Memorial Opera House (San Francisco). Though many of Lansburgh's best-known works, including El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, were on the West Coast, his personal favorite was said to have been the Al Hirschfeld Theatre (originally the Martin Beck Theatre) in New York City.

Built in 1803, it is one of only five surviving brick Federal style houses in the city. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. It now houses professional offices.  Description  The Jacob Pledger House is located in northern Middletown, on the west side of Newfield Street at its junction with La Rosa Lane. It is a 2-1/2 story masonry structure, built out of red brick and covered by a gabled roof with end chimneys. Its main facade is five bays wide, with symmetrically arranged windows and a center entrance. Ground floor windows are topped by brownstone lintels, and the entrance has a half-round transom window. The interior of the house has a number of original architectural features, most notably including its carved wooden staircase. The house was built in 1803 by Jacob Pledger, on of land originally belonging to his father-in-law. Pledger was an English immigrant who worked as an agent for a local brewery. The property was roughly bisected by Newfield Street, and remained in agricultural use until after World War II. Pledger sold the property in 1813 to Samuel Miller, whose descendants kept the property until 1953, when it was sold to the city for development. The city subsequently sold the house with covenants to protect its historic features.

AILLA is a digital language archive dedicated to the digitization and preservation of primary data, such as field notes, texts, audio and video recordings, in or about Latin American indigenous languages. AILLA's holdings are available on the Internet and are open to the public wherever privacy and intellectual property concerns are met. AILLA has access portals in both English and Spanish; all metadata are available in both languages, as well as in indigenous languages where possible. Vanishing Voices In this global media age, more and more indigenous languages are being superseded by global languages such as Spanish, English, and Portuguese. Frequently, recordings made by researchers such as linguists, anthropologists, and ethnomusicologists, and by community members and speakers, are the only record of these languages. These recordings might be stored in university offices or in private homes where they are not accessible to others. AILLA provides a permanent home for these recordings in order to make them available to the speakers and to the rest of the world via the Internet. Archive The collection currently contains roughly 7,500 hours of archived audio materials, representing more than 300 languages from at least 28 countries. This is supplemented by a significant number of images, videos, and text files. Altogether, the archive contains more than 110,000 individual files (correct as of June 2016). The database of archived materials can be freely searched via both the English and Spanish portals available on the AILLA webpage, as well as the Open Languages Archives Community. Direct access to archived recordings requires registration and sometimes needs permission as specified by the depositor. Downloads are free of charge. A large part of the project is the digitization of valuable analog recordings of languages and cultures from the Latin America that will otherwise deteriorate or be lost forever. Researchers whose materials are represented in these collections include Terrence Kaufman, Lyle Campbell, and Nora England. Analog recordings are digitized at the highest possible fidelity to ensure high- quality digital files result. The current international archive standard for PCM audio files is 24-bit resolution and a sample rate of 96 kHz.

Alex Müller, discovered high-temperature superconductivity in ceramics, for which they shared the 1987 Nobel Prize in Physics. Life and work Bednorz was born in Neuenkirchen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany to elementary-school teacher Anton and piano teacher Elisabeth Bednorz, as the youngest of four children. His parents were both from Silesia in Central Europe, but were forced to move westwards in turbulences of World War II. including the Nobel Lecture, December 8, 1987 Perovskite-Type Oxides – The New Approach to High-Tc Superconductivity As a child, his parents tried to get him interested in classical music, but he was more practically inclined, preferring to work on motorcycles and cars. (Although as a teenager he did eventually learn to play the violin and trumpet.) In high school he developed an interest in the natural sciences, focusing on chemistry, which he could learn in a hands-on manner through experiments. In 1968, Bednorz enrolled at the University of Münster to study chemistry. However, he soon felt lost in the large body of students, and optrf to switch to the much less popular subject of crystallography, a subfield of mineralogy at the interface of chemistry and physics. In 1972, his teachers Wolfgang Hoffmann and Horst Böhm arranged for him to spend the summer at the IBM Zurich Research Laboratory as a visiting student. The experience here would shape his further career: not only did he meet his later collaborator K. Alex Müller, the head of the physics department, but he also experienced the atmosphere of creativity and freedom cultivated at the IBM lab, which he credits as a strong influence on his way of conducting science. After another visit in 1973, he came to Zurich in 1974 for six months to do the experimental part of his diploma work. Here he grew crystals of SrTiO3, a ceramic material belonging to the family of perovskites. Müller, himself interested in perovskites, urged him to continue his research, and after obtaining his master's degree from Münster in 1977 Bednorz started a PhD at the ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology) under supervision of Heini Gränicher and Alex Müller. In 1978, his future wife, Mechthild Wennemer, whom he had met in Münster, followed him to Zürich to start her own PhD. In 1982, after obtaining his PhD, he joined the IBM lab. There, he joined Müller's ongoing research on superconductivity. In 1983, Bednorz and Müller began a systematic study of the electrical properties of ceramics formed from transition metal oxides, and in 1986 they succeeded in inducing superconductivity in a lanthanum barium copper oxide (LaBaCuO, also known as LBCO). The oxide's critical temperature (Tc) was 35 K, a full 12 K higher than the previous record. This discovery stimulated a great deal of additional research in high-temperature superconductivity on cuprate materials with structures similar to LBCO, soon leading to the discovery of compounds such as BSCCO (Tc 107K) and YBCO (Tc 92K). In 1987, Bednorz and Müller were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics \\"for their important break-through in the discovery of superconductivity in ceramic materials\\".The Nobel Prize in Physics 1987. nobelprize.org In the same year Bednorz was appointed an IBM Fellow.

The main idea of MGT is that \\"Language serves its creators better than those in other groups who have to learn to use the language as best they can.\\" The term mutedness refers to a group's inability to express themselves due to this inequity. The theory describes the relationship between a dominant group and its subordinate group(s) as being as follows: 1) the dominant group contributes mostly to the formulation of the language system, including the social norms and vocabulary, and 2) members from the subordinate group have to learn and use the dominant language to express themselves. However, this translation process may result in the loss and distortion of information as the people from subordinate groups cannot articulate their ideas clearly. The dominant group may also ignore the voice of the marginalized group. All these may eventually lead to the mutedness of the subordinate group. Although this theory was initially developed to study the different situations faced by women and men, it can also be applied to any marginalized group that is muted by the inadequacies of their languages. Overview  = Origin =  Background  in 1968, Edwin Ardener pointed out a phenomenon where anthropologists had difficulties reproducing models of the society from women's perspectives, if they (the models) do not conform to those generated by men. In 1971, Shirley Ardener cited instances from feminism movements to articulate how women as a muted group used body symbolism to justify their actions and arguments in her article \\"Sexual Insult and Female Militancy\\". In 1975, Shirley Ardener reprinted Edwin's paper \\"The Interpretation of Ritual,1972\\" and included her sexual insult text in the book \\"Perceiving Women\\", for which she wrote an intro. Genesis 336x336pxMuted Group Theory was firstly developed in the field of cultural anthropology by the British anthropologist, Edwin Ardener. The first formulation of MGT emerges from one of Edwin Ardener's short essays, entitled \\"Belief and the Problem of Women,\\" in which Ardener explored the \\"problem\\" of women. In social anthropology, the problem of women is divided in two parts: technical and analytical. The technical problem is that although half of the population and society is technically made up of women, ethnographers have often ignored this half of the population. Ardener writes that \\"those trained in ethnography evidently have a bias towards the kinds of model that men are ready to provide (or to concur in) rather than towards any that women might provide.\\"Ardener, Edwin, & Chapman, Malcolm. (2007). The voice of prophecy and other essays. New York: Berghahn Books. He also suggests that the reason behind this is that men tend to give a \\"bounded model of society\\" akin to the ones that ethnographers are attracted to. Therefore, men are those who produce and control symbolic production in a society. This leads to the analytical part of the problem which attempts to answer the question: \\"[…] if the models of society made by most ethnographers tend to be models derived from the male portion of that society, how does the symbolic weight of the other mass of persons express itself?\\" After conducting an experiment with the information in his essay, the results indicated that the male point of view is the dominant point of view in society, which is why it is depicted with a standard solid line in this graph. On the other hand, the female point of view is considered as non-dominant and non-standard, so it falls into the muted category with the broken line. According to Ardener, because male-based understandings of society represent the dominant worldview, certain groups are silenced or muted. He writes: \\"In these terms if the male perception yields a dominant structure, the female one is a muted structure.\\" As part of the critical approach to the world, Ardener uses MGT to explore the power and societal structure in relation to the dynamism between dominant and subordinated groups. Moreover, Ardener's concept of muted groups does not only apply to women but can also be applied to other non-dominant groups within social structures.  Expansion  Source Scholars Cheris Kramerae, Barrie Thorne and Nancy Henley were interested in exploring ways language “defines, deprecates, and ignores women”. What they discovered is that \\"male dominance affects more than just the way sexes speak but the content and structure of the English language. Women are often defined by their relation to men (“Miss/Mrs.” or “Harold’s Widow”) while men have more autonomous varied linguistic status.\\" Thus, Kramerae attributed the series of phenomena to a conception \\"man-made language\\". Representations of man-made language can be found in daily social life. For instance, women and men that are of the same social rank are usually addressed by asymmetrical usages of first and last name (women are usually called by first name while men are by the last name); or associations of certain words with women are formed to maintain the social stereotype (sewing, cooking, house chores, etc.). = Key concepts =  Mutedness  Graphic highlighting ways women are silenced. Mutedness does not equal silence. Mutedness occurs when people cannot articulate their ideas, regardless of time and space, without changing their language to meet the dominant group's vocabulary. Mutedness results from the lack of power and might lead to being overlooked, muffled, and invisible. As gender communication scholar Cheris Kramarae states, social interaction and communication create the current language structure. Because the latter was mainly built by men, men have an advantage over women. Consequently, women cannot express their thoughts through their own words because their language use is limited by the rules of a man's language. Rowley, MA: Print. Kramarae states: \\"The language of a particular culture does not serve all its speakers equally, for not all speakers contribute in an equal fashion to its formulation. Women (as well as members of other non-dominant groups) are not as free or as able as men are to say what they wish, because the words and the norms for their use have been formulated by the dominant group, men.\\" As Cowan points out, \\" 'mutedness' does not refer to the absence of voice but to a kind of distortion where subordinate voices…are allowed to speak but only in the confines of the dominant communication system.\\"Cowan, R. (May, 2007). Muted group theory: Providing answers and raising questions concerning workplace bullying. Conference Papers -- National Communication Association. Chicago, IL.  Muted group  Muted group or subordinated group is relative to the dominant group. According to Gerdrin, muting or silencing is a social phenomenon based on the tacit understanding that within a society there are dominant and non-dominant groups.Gendrin, D. M. Homeless women's inner voices: Friends or foes?, in Hearing many voices. Hampton Press. Thus, the muting process is a socially shared phenomenon that presupposes a collective understanding of who is in power and who is not. The discrepancies in power result in the \\"oppressor\\" and \\"the oppressed\\". Kramarae points out that muted group as \\"the oppressed\\" are people who don't have a \\"public recognized vocabulary\\" to express their experience. Their failure in articulate their ideas lead to their doubt about \\"the validity of their experience\\" and \\"the legitimacy of their feelings\\". Kramarae also addresses that gender, race, and class hierarchies, where muted groups, are supported by our \\"political, educational, religious, legal, and media systems\\". Due to the lack of power, muted groups are usually at the margin of the society.  The \\"muting\\" process  352x352pxSeveral scholars have researched and studied how the \\"muting\\" process occurs. Houston and Kramarae posit that women have been silenced in many ways by for example ridiculing women's related lexicon, reinforcing family hierarchies, constructing a male-controlled media, trivializing their opinions, ideas, and concerns, and censoring women's voices. A central factor that contributes to these silencing methods is the trivialization of the lexicon and speech patterns that is often used to describe female activities. Other than verbal communications, nonverbal ones are also considered as means of the “muting” process. Including demeanor, distribution of space, touch, eye contact, and visibility, etc.Henley N, Henley N M. Body politics: Power, sex, and nonverbal communication[M]. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1977. According to West and Turner (2010), individuals can use the following strategies to avoid the \\"muting\\" process: * Name the silencing factors, had it been men or news agencies. * Reclaim, elevate and celebrate women's discourse. * Create new words to the language system that are inclusive of marginalized groups and gendered words and experiences. * Use media platforms (traditional and new) to voice groups.West, Richard L., and Lynn H. Turner (2010). Introducing Communication Theory: Analysis and Application. 5th ed. Boston: McGraw-Hill. Web  Assumptions  According to Cheris Kramarae, MGT makes three assumptions : = Assumption #1 = The different experiences caused by the division of labor result in the different perceptions that women and men hold towards the world Using men's words is a disadvantage to women because Kramarae believes that men and women are vastly different and thus will view the world differently from each other. This stems from the distinction between the meanings of the words \\"sex\\" and \\"gender\\". Kramerae believes that communication between men and women is not on an even level. This is because language is man made. This makes it easier for men to communicate over women. Symbolic Interactionism Theory believes that \\"the extent of knowing is the extent of naming.\\" When applied to muted group, this means women have an extreme disadvantage over men because men are the namers. = Assumption #2 = Women find it difficult to articulate their ideas as men's experience are dominant Kramarae argues that English is a \\"[hu]man-made language\\" and that it \\"embodies the perspectives of the masculine more than the feminine\\", while supporting \\"the perceptions of white middle-class males. Men are the standard.\\"Littlejohn, S.W., & Foss, K.A. (2011). Theories of human communication, 10th ed. Long Grove, IL: Waveland Press. P148 In other words, Kramerae argues that men use language to dominate women, so that women's voices become less present, or \\"muted\\". Kramarae also explains that men's control over language has produced an abundance of derogatory words for women and their speech patterns. Some of these include names such as \\"slut\\", \\"whore\\", and \\"easy lay\\", along with speech patterns such as \\"gossiping\\", \\"whining\\", and \\"bitching\\". When it comes to words connoting promiscuity, there are fewer male-specific terms and the ones that do exist are seen in a positive/sexual light. These include words such as \\"stud\\", \\"player\\", and \\"pimp\\" (p. 465). Kramarae suggests these harmful words shape our reality. She believes that \\"words constantly ignored may eventually come to be unspoken and perhaps even unthought\\". This can lead women to doubt themselves and the intentions of their feelings. Women are at a disadvantage once again. = Assumption #3 = Women have to go through a translation process when speaking in order to participate in social life Kramarae says that women need to choose their words carefully in public. According to Kramarae, this is because, \\"what women want to say and can say best cannot be said easily because the language template is not of their own making.\\" Another example of the male-dominated language Kramarae brings up is that in public speaking, women most often use sports and war analogies (things most women do not usually associate themselves with) in order to relate to their male audiences. This stems from the market being dominated by males for so long. Almost all prominent authors, theorists, and scientists have historically been male. This allows for them to give women the \\"facts\\" they should believe about society and life in general. Kramarae also believes that \\"males have more difficulty than females in understanding what members of the other gender mean.\\" Feminist scholar Dale Spender supports the idea that language, and society in general, is traditionally male-centric. \\"Masculinity is the unmarked form: the assumption is that the world is male unless proven otherwise. Femininity is the marked form: it is the proof of otherwise.\\" If masculinity, and subsequently language, are unmarked forms, than any marked form must go through a translation process in order to participate in social life. Applications = Contexts = Marginalized groups in a given culture or society experience the process of muting in social contexts including but not limited to:  Mass Media  Application in mass media - Women in the mass media industry According to Kramarae, women have been locked out of the publishing business until 1970; thus they lacked influence on mass media and have often been misrepresented in history. The reason behind this lies in the predominance of male gatekeepers, who are defined as editors and other arbiters of a culture who determine which books, essays, poetry, plays, film scripts, etc. will appear in the mass media. Similarly, Pamela Creedon argues that in the mid-70s there is an increase of women in the male-dominated profession of journalism. In The Status of Women in the U.S. Media 2014, The Women's Media Centre researchers explore the current status of women in the mass media industry. The report compiles 27,000 pieces of content among \\"20 of the most widely circulated, read, and viewed, and listened TV networks, newspapers, news wires, and online news in the United States.\\" The results show that women (36.1%) are significantly out-numbered by men (63.4%). Although the number of women on TV news broadcasts is generally growing, the misrepresentation of women does not only regard their presence as anchors but also the events that they cover. Several studies show that while men mainly report on \\"hard\\" news, women are often relegated to cover \\"soft\\" news. Thus, women are often muted in terms of the topics they tend to cover. Although the Women's Media Centre study is very U.S.-centric, non-dominant groups are often muted even in other country's media landscapes. For example, Aparna Hebbani and Charise-Rose Wills have explored how Muslim women have often been muted in the Australian mass media sphere. Their study shows that women that wear a hijab or burqa are often inaccurately and negatively connoted in Australian mass media. According to the authors, Muslim women represent a muted group and thus cannot entirely incorporate their experiences, views, and perspective in their representation in Australian media. Thus, there is a social hierarchy that is privileging certain groups via Australian mass media. It also shows that although currently muted, this group is attempting to gain a voice in this media landscape by engaging and interacting with members of the dominant culture in order to negotiate their silenced position.  Social Rituals  Application in social rituals - A father gives his daughter away at the wedding ceremony. There are some conventional stereotypes attached to men and women in society when an individual's behavior deviates from this norm they attain \\"negative feedback\\" for this opposition to the norm by their actions. In the case of women, this gets quite complicated as women are told to act in a certain manner, but when they do try and emulate their male counterparts, they are \\"discriminated\\" and \\"discouraged\\" for acting that way. Social rituals are another example of a place in which the muting process takes place. Kramarae suggests that many elements within wedding ceremonies place women in a silenced position. For example, the fact that the father of the bride \\"gives her away\\" to the groom, that the position of the bride – at the left of the minister – is considered less privileged than the one of the groom, that the groom announces his vows first, and that the groom is asked to kiss the bride, are all factors that contribute to the position of a woman as subordinated to the one of the man. As Catharine MacKinnon (one of the leading voices in the feminist legal movement ) suggests, the law sees women similarly as men see women. Like language, the legal system has thus been created, defined, and interpreted mostly by men. In the context of unequal power relations between men and women, MacKinnon proposes new standards to define and evaluate sexual harassment and sex-related issues considered as the consequence of unwanted impositions of sexual requirements. Finley argues that there has been a recent interest in feminist jurisprudence and legal scholarship inspired by the law's failure to see that despite the legal removal of barriers, sexes are not socially equal.  The Workplace  Application in the workplace - Women in the workplace In 1940s America, women entered the workplace in great numbers while men were at war. However, after the war period, the society did not encourage the participation of women in the workplace, and in this way tried to assert male dominance in the society. Organizations still appear to be male dominated. Women's experiences are often not taken into account in the workplace the way male experiences are. The \\"structure\\" is maintained by men who primarily use communication from the male perspective. Most organization goals are met by the usage of \\"male-preferential\\" language, as they tend to focus on aspects such as \\"economic gain\\" and \\"performance improved\\". The main point of organizational communication is that it can help an employee fulfill their work duties. Women are not able to fulfill these duties using language more relevant to them, so in order to attain success in their workplace, they have to go beyond their natural realm and utilize \\"male-preferential\\" language. One of the ways that women are differentiated can be observed when we take the \\"performance appraisals\\" into consideration. What they mainly consist of is reviews that are based on the standards that are more like \\"masculine\\" standards. Research points to muted groups having little to no sense of agency, dominant emotions, and can point to the employee’s role in the silencing. One member of the subordinate group that is also silenced in the workplace are women who face sexual harassment by the dominant group. Many women have a hard time when faced with harassment in a male dominated workplace because they are \\"the verbal minority\\". Organizations rarely encourage issues of sexual harassment be discussed openly and call for confidentiality when dealing with complaints. Furthermore, women rarely go through formal channels of reporting sexual harassment for a number of reasons to include: \\"expecting their compliant to be ignored or trivialized by the male dominant group, fear of not being protected from retaliation, worry that the male dominated hierarchy will 'team up' against them, or that their time will be wasted due to the organizations ineffective sexual harassment policy.\\" Those from the subordinate groups are trusted less than white men in the workplace and in general.  Politics  Application in politics - Third Party Debate 2012 Independent parties have emerged since World War II to offer people alternative choices for election. However, most of these parties operate only in \\"circumscribed regions or with very narrow platforms\\". Prentice studied the impact of the third party, i.e., candidates from non- major parties, in public debate. He finds out that there have been few studies around third party by 2003 and even though third party candidates are involved in public campaign debates, they remain inarticulate and ignored due to the judgment by \\"standard of the political rhetoric and worldview of the major parties\\". Prentice points out that major parties usually interfere with the free expression of third parties through three ways: \\"ignoring their claims, appearing confused (verbally or nonverbally) by the claims, or actively attacking the claims made\\". He also notices that the debate questions are structured in a way that reflects major parties' worldviews, which results in third party's mutedness. In order to participate and articulate their own worldview, third party candidates have to transform their ideas to match the major parties' models through emphasizing the agreements with the majority rather than the differences and sometimes may lead them to make statements that can be misinterpreted. In an electoral system where career continuity is valued, women candidates are placed at a disadvantaged position competing with their male opponents. Stereotypical opinions like women as default caretakers of domestic business impose disadvantages on women, as they are thought to be incapable of being consistent with their work for family reasons. Disadvantages imposed by deep-rooted stereotypes and how electoral rules orient voters’ predisposition reduce women’s chance of success and render women “muted” in political atmosphere.Jost, John et al. “The Psychology of Legitimacy: Emerging Perspectives on Ideology, Justice, and Intergroup Relations.” Social justice research 1 Mar. 2004: 93–109. Web.  Education  Application in education - \\"Women's studies\\" The classroom can be a place where women are muted. Women's education in the United States has progressed over the years, but academia is still male-dominated. Kramarae has raised several suggestions for more inclusive educational environments, such as including \\"women's humor\\", \\"speechlessness\\", and ways to address the issue of \\"abusive language\\". Including more diverse language systems in academia can keep it from being dominated by one way of thinking. In the classroom, men and women utilize language differently. The bond differently with other members of their gender. Women tend to bond with each other through the process of discussing their problems, while men bond with each other using \\"playful insults\\" and \\"put downs\\". In the event of classroom discussions, men tend to believe that they are supposed to dominate the class discussion while women avoid dominating the discussions. Houston believes in order to create a positive reform in education it might be useful to revise the curriculum and lay special stress on \\"woman-centered communication\\" education. Women's Studies (WS) has evolved and grown over the years. Today there is greater demand for faculty to be on initiatives such as WS programs, African American Programs, and other programs focused on marginalized groups.  Theology  Rejection to all religions became a central issue to feminism in the 1970s.Ruether, Rosemary Radford. Religion and Sexism; Images of Woman in the Jewish and Christian Traditions. New York: Simon and Schuster, 1974. Print. This issue has been addressed in many well-known feminist texts, such as Kate Millett’s Sexual Politics and Andrea Dworkin’s Right-Wing Women,Millett, Kate, MacKinnon, Catharine A., and Mead, Rebecca. Sexual Politics . New York: Columbia University Press, 2016. Print.Dworkin, Andrea. Right-Wing Women . New York: Coward, McCann, 1983. Print. the second-wave feminism considered religion as an anti-women force founded by men to subordinate women. According to Sheila Jeffreys, “religion founds men’s authority over women and makes resistance difficult, because fear of divine punishment keeps women in their place.” Such Him power is thus seemed as a “sinful but unchangeable” muting process. The cultural root of housewife can be contributed by the Christianity religion, for instance. Being a stay-home mother is recognized as a Christian vocation, as women “should realize that her many tasks, caring for children and helping or being obedient to her husband” and consider accomplishing these chores to be a holy job and noble gift given by God. Similar beliefs can also be found in the context of Judaism, where women are confined to the private life sphere. Jewish women in the family are expected to perform domestic duties, such as caring for children and husband. Also, rights of women are circumscribed by religious traditions in terms of marriage and social contacts. = Variables = According to MGT, the voices of marginalized groups are muted because the factors of individuals do not synchronize with the standards set by dominant groups. These factors include but not limited to:  Language  Application in language - A Feminist Dictionary According to Kissack, traditionally communication has been constructed within the framework of a male dominated society. Women in corporate organizations are expected to use language associated with women, that is, \\"female- preferential\\" language. It has been considered as lower than the \\"male- preferential\\" language. The primary difference between the two is \\"male- preferential\\" language consists of details such as opinions and facts whereas \\"female-preferential\\" language consists mainly of personal details, emotions reflected in the conversations, also there is a great use of adjectives in it. Moreover, according to socialist historian Sheila Rowbotham, language is considered to be a tool manipulated by people of superior social rank to conserve their status quo.Rowbotham, Sheila. Woman’s Consciousness, Man’s World. Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1973. Print. Muted group theory has \\"recognized that women's voices are muted in Western society so that their experiences are not fully represented in language and has argued that women's experiences merit linguistic recognition\\". Kramarae states that in order to change muted group status we also need to change dictionaries. Traditional dictionaries rely on the majority of their information to come from male literary sources. These male sources have the power to exclude words important to or created by women. Furthering this idea, Kramarae and Paula Treichler created A Feminist Dictionary with words they believed Merriam-Webster defined on male ideas. For example, the word \\"Cuckold\\" is defined as \\"the husband of an unfaithful wife\\" in Merriam Webster. However, there is no term for a wife who has an unfaithful husband. She is simply called a wife. Another example Kramarae defined was the word \\"doll\\". She defined \\"doll\\" as \\"a toy playmate given to, or made by children\\". Some adult males continue their childhood by labeling adult female companions \\"dolls\\". The feminist dictionary includes up to 2,500 words to emphasize women's linguistic ability and to give women words of empowerment and change their muted status.Treichler, P., and C. Kramarae. (1985) A feminist dictionary. Boston. Print. Long argues that words can shape reality and feelings. She also believes that women can grab opportunities to take up physical and political space if they are given more verbal space.Long, Hannah R. \\"Expanding the Dialogue: 7e Need for Fat Studies in Critical Intercultural Communication.\\" (Winter 2015).  Sexuality  Application in LGBT study - \\"Older LGBT Group celebrating Pride\\" in Trafalgar Square, London. LGBT groups are considered marginalized and muted in our society.Muñoz, J. E. (1999). Disidentifications: Queers of color and the performance of politics. Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press. The dominant groups who \\"hold privileged positions within society\\" have developed social norms that marginalize LGBT groups. Although LGBT individuals do not necessarily share the same identity, they share similar experiences of being marginalized by the dominant groups. As Gross notes, \\"For many oppressed groups the experience of commonality is largely the commonality of their difference from, and oppression by, the dominant culture\\".Gross, L. (1993). Contested closets: The politics and ethics of outing. Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press. In order to function and achieve success within the dominant culture, LGBT groups must adopt certain communication strategies to match the social norms.  Race  Application in race - \\"the right to be heard\\" Gloria Ladson- Billings believes that \\"stories provide the necessary context for understanding, feeling, and interpreting\\" and argues that voices of dispossessed and marginalized groups such as people of color are muted within the dominant culture. Critical race theorists try to bring the marginalized group's viewpoint to the forefront through an encouragement of \\"naming one's own reality\\". Delgado addresses three reasons for \\"naming one's own reality\\" in legal discourse: \\"1) much of 'reality' is socially constructed; 2) stories provide members of outgroups a vehicle for psychic self-preservation; and 3) the exchange of stories from teller to listener can help overcome ethnocentrism and the dysconscious drive or need to view the world in one way\\". When it comes to education, critical race theorists argue that the official school curriculum is designed to maintain a \\"White supremacist master script\\". As Swartz contends, master scripting sets the standard knowledge for students, which legitimizes \\"dominant, white, upper-class, male voices\\" and mutes multiple perspectives. The voices from other non-dominant groups are under control, mastered and can only be heard through reshaping and translation to meet the dominant standard. Therefore, Lasdon-Billing argues that the curriculum should be race-neutral or colorblind, present people of color, and \\"presume a homogenized 'we' in a celebration of diversity\\".  Age  Ageism leads to certain age groups being muted in American society. In particular, the elderly are often ignored and marginalized. In Muted lives: Older battered women, Carol Seaver discusses how older abused women are silenced because of sexism and ageism. She focuses on issues specific to elderly abused women, not just abused women in general. She argues that this group of domestic abuse survivors faces a specific set of difficulties, \\"They are silenced by ageist assumptions about them as too resistant and hopeless to change or made invisible by the notion that very frail elders are the only victims of elder abuse.\\" Here, age intersects with gender to create a specific kind of muted group. In Muted groups in health communication policy and practice: The case of older adults in rural and frontier areas, Deborah Ballard-Reisch examines how and why elderly populations in the rural areas of Nevada and Kansas are considered muted health communication groups. Ageism, as well as other factors, result in this community being muted. Aging populations, as seen in Seaver and Ballard-Reisch's works, can be silenced by stereotypes, such as the idea that the elderly are resistant to change. Issues of ageism intersect with heterosexism when looking at how aging LGBT community members are silenced. Scholar Maria T. Brown writes, \\"The exclusion of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) elders from queer and gerontological theories has resulted in the silencing of LGBT older adults and their experiences.\\" Brown claims that the silencing is a \\"rhetorical move\\" that excludes the elderly from queer theory and queerness from the field gerontology. This case study is an example of how identities intersect (in this case, being elderly and part of the LGBT community). MGT can apply to both of these identities and intersections.  Disability  Marcel Calvez argues that, \\"What makes a social group muted is that claims of its members to participate into social life are discounted and that they have internalised the idea that they are not entitled to raise their voice.\\" By this logic, he says that those with intellectual disabilities are muted. Calvez's study examines the experiences of those with intellectual disabilities, with special attention to the fact these groups are often marginalized and silenced. Many disabled groups are silenced by the dominant abled group that knowingly or unknowingly exclude them. The means of muting, ridicule, ritual, control, and harassment can all apply to disabled groups. Ableist language, such as use of the pejorative term \\"retard\\", can be used to ridicule disabled groups. By bringing attention to the use of pejoratives and how they affect certain communities, disabled individuals and abled allies can raise awareness about their harm.  Navigating the Muted Status  To get their concerns recognized by the dominant group, the subordinate groups take on language and communication styles of the dominant group. There are particularly stringent demands on the performances by members of \\"inferior\\" groups when they communicate with persons from the dominant group. Orbe (1994) identified six themes central to African American male communication: \\"(1) the importance of other African Americans, (2) learning how to communicate with non-African Americans, (3) keeping a safe distance, (4) playing the part (snap!), (5) testing the sincerity of non-African Americans, and (6) an intense social responsibility.\\" Respondents in Orbe’s research were observed changing immediately into two different people, in order to play the part, when communicating with non-African Americans. In addition to African American men feeling as though they need to communicate differently with White men, African American women also feel pressure to conform to the dominant language. A speaker’s dialect (e.g. Black English or Mainstream American English) is most heavily influenced by his or her place in the social hierarchy, for example, the speaker’s socio-economic status, educational status, provenance, and/or racial/ethnic origin. As a result, African American women find themselves needing to “code-switch” when communicating with the dominant group.  Strategies of Resistance  MGT offers ways to change the muting status quo, i.e., naming the strategies of silencing, reclaiming, elevating and celebrating women's discourse, and creating new languages based on the experience of the marginalized group. Women as a muted group recognize the ways in which women are silenced both interpersonally and societally, but also stress the ways that they resist being silenced such as labeling and talking about problems that are usually ignored in the dominant discourse (Vonnegut 1992). Specifically, with the creation of the Feminist Theory to understand the nature of gender inequality. Additionally, in the last year, the international movement against sexual harassment and assault with the Me Too Movement are other examples of strategies of resistance against the dominant group.  Extension  Although the muted group theory has been mainly developed as a feminist theory, it can also be applied to other silenced groups in society. Mark Orbe, a communication theorist, has suggested that in the U.S. the dominant group consists of white, heterosexual, middle-class, males. Thus, groups that distinguish themselves from the dominant one in terms of race, age, gender, sexual orientation, and economic status can potentially be silenced or muted. = Interethnic Communication = In African-American communication research: Toward a deeper understanding of interethnic communication (1995) and Constructing co-cultural theory: An explication of culture, power, and communication (1998), Orbe fleshed out two important extensions of muted group theory: *Muting as described in muted group theory can be applied to many cultural groups. Orbe stated that research performed by the dominant white European culture has created a view of African-American communication \\"which promotes the illusion that all African-Americans, regardless of gender, age, class, or sexual orientation, communicate in a similar manner.\\" *There are several ways in which members of a muted group can face their position within the dominant culture. Orbe identified 26 different ways that members of muted groups can use to face the structures and messages imposed by dominant groups. For example, individuals can choose to (1) emphasize commonalities and downplay cultural differences, (2) educate others about norms of the muted group, and (3) avoid members of the dominant group. Orbe also suggests that individuals choose one of the 26 different ways based on previous experiences, context, abilities, and perceived costs and rewards. Therefore, although Kramarae focuses on women's muted voices, she also opens the door to the application of muted group theory to issues beyond gender differences. Orbe not only applies this theoretical framework to a different muted group, i.e. African-Americans, but also contributes by assessing \\"how individual and small collectives work together to negotiate their muted group status.\\" = Co-cultural Communication = Orbe regards \\"interactions among underrepresented and dominant group members\\" as co-cultural communication. He argues that there are three preferred outcomes in the co-cultural communication process: \\"assimilation (e.g., becoming integrated into mainstream culture), accommodation (gaining acceptance and space in a society and achieving cultural pluralism without hierarchy), or separation (maintaining a culturally distinct identity in intercultural interactions.\\" He also notes three communication approaches: \\"nonassertive (when individuals are constrained and nonconfrontational, putting the needs of others first to avoid conflicts), assertive (when individuals express feelings, ideas, and rights in ways that consider the needs of themselves and others), or aggressive (when individuals express feelings, ideas, and rights in ways that ignore the needs of others).\\" The different combinations of the three preferred outcomes and three communication approaches result in nine communication orientations. Further, although various groups can be considered as muted within society, silenced and dominant groups can also exist within any group. For example, Anita Taylor and M. J. Hardman posit that feminist movements can also present dominant subgroups that mute other groups within the same movement. Thus, members within oppressed groups can have diverse opinions and one can become dominant and further mute the others.  Critiques  Edwin Ardener saw that MGT had pragmatic as well as analytical potentials. Edwin Ardener always maintained that MGT was not only, or even primarily, about women - although women comprised a conspicuous case in point. In fact, he also drew on his personal experience as a sensitive (intellectual) boy among hearty (sportive) boys in an all boys London secondary school. As a result of his early encounters with other boys, he identified with other groups in society for whom self-expression was constrained. MGT has often been challenged. Deborah Tannen, the theorist that created Genderlect Theory, criticizes feminist scholars like Kramarae for assuming that men are trying to control women. Tannen acknowledges that differences in male and female communication styles sometimes lead to imbalances of power, but unlike Kramarae, she is willing to assume that the problems are caused primarily by men and women's different styles. Tannen warns readers that \\"bad feelings and imputation of bad motives or bad character can come about when there was no intention to dominate, to wield power\\". Kramerae thinks Tannen's opinion is naïve. She believes men belittle and ignore women whenever they speak out against being muted. She also pointed out that \\"our political, educational, religious, legal, and media systems support gender, race, and class hierarchies\\". Both theorists believe muting is involved, but they see it from different standpoints. What’s more, Carol Gilligan presented another reasoning concerning why women and men perceive “reality” differently. She posited that, instead of men presumably being the dominant sources of languages and voices, it is because women and men have different means of formulating their sense of “self”.Gilligan, Carol. In a Different Voice : Psychological Theory and Women’s Development . Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 1993. Print. According to Gilligan, women’s moral domain is more care-based, which means women perceive the reality based on the relations with others, whereas men forge their identity through separation, focusing on self-assessment and individual achievement. These two approaches eventually lead women and men to construct different understandings of integrity and different senses of reality.

It was largely used in France, and is one of the most well-known pieces of furniture from the French Renaissance. This chair is often associated with groups of women sitting and conversing. Due to fashions of the time and the lack of heating systems in homes, women wore several layers of skirts and petticoats to keep warm. This often prevented them from fitting comfortably into armchairs with rectangular seats. A caquetoire seat is splayed so women in their large skirts could easily sit. These chairs were often made from walnut rather than oak allowing the frames to be more elaborately carved. They were built with mortise and tenon joinery, so no nails were exposed and no glue had to be used. The supports were baluster-turned and terminated in bun feet. The name caquetoire is derived from “caqueter”, a French term meaning “to chat”. The chair was thus named the caquetoire as a reference to women sitting and talking. References *Boger, Louise Ade.

The city is Canada's centre for French-language television productions, radio, theatre, film, multimedia and print publishing. The Quartier Latin is a neighbourhood crowded with cafés animated by this literary and musical activity. Montreal's many cultural communities have given it a distinct local culture. As a North American city, Montreal shares many of the cultural features characteristic of the other metropolis on the continent, including representations in all traditional manifestation of high culture, a long- lasting tradition of jazz and rock music, and tentative experimentation in visual arts, theatre, music, and dance. Yet, being at the confluence of the French and the English traditions, Montreal has developed a unique and distinguished cultural face in the world. Another distinctive characteristic of Montreal culture life is to be found in the animation of its downtown, particularly during summer, prompted by cultural and social events, or festivals. Arts =Place des Arts= A cultural heart of classical art and the venue for many summer festivals, the Place des Arts is a complex of different concert and theatre halls surrounding a large open-spaced square in the downtown. Culture lovers will find six concert and theatre halls, five of them inside: Salle Wilfrid-Pelletier, Théâtre Maisonneuve, Théâtre Jean- Duceppe, Cinquième Salle, Studio-Théâtre and one outside site: l'Esplanade. Classical dances, operas, plays, and music performance from troops around the world and from Montreal's very own are scheduled in these halls on a daily basis. The Musée d'art contemporain is located across the Esplanade from Place des Arts, and some of the most important theatre troupes and musical concert scenes are found nearby in what is now called the Quartier des Spectacles. Dance and performing arts Performing at Place des Arts is the city's chief ballet company Les Grands Ballets Canadiens. In contemporary dance, Montreal has been a leader, particularly since the 1980s. Internationally recognized avant-garde dance troupes such as La La La Human Steps, O Vertigo, and the Fondation Jean-Pierre Perreault have toured the world and worked with international popular artists during videos and concerts. The intelligent and seamless integration of multi-disciplinary arts into the choreography of these troupes helped pave the way for the popularity of the Cirque du Soleil, a multimillion-dollar empire based on a mixture of modern circus and performing acts. The Agora de la danse is a studio where contemporary dancers most often perform. Classical music The Place des Arts also harbors the headquarters of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra (MSO) that perform in its halls regularly. The MSO is one of the top performance troupes in North America, most remembered for the quality performance of the repertoire of Maurice Ravel. Since 2006, the MSO has a new conductor, the American Kent Nagano. Two other popular Montreal orchestras that perform regularly at Places des Arts are the Orchestre Métropolitain conducted by Yannick Nézet-Séguin and I Musici de Montréal, a chamber orchestra founded by Yuli Turovsky and since 2011 conducted by Jean-Marie Zeitouni. I Musici de Montréal are considered among the greatest interpreters of the works of George Frideric Handel. Place des Arts is also the home of the Opéra de Montréal, the most prestigious opera company in Montreal. One Montreal radio station is entirely devoted to classical music. =Music= Given that Montreal is mostly French-speaking, most popular local bands and singers have sung in French. In the past, the most popular local artists succeeded in filling arenas (Beau Dommage, Offenbach, Cowboys Fringants) or even the Olympic Stadium (e.g. Diane Dufresne), a feat usually reserved to a few international rock stars. Special events, such as the musical show on the Quebec national holiday, regularly attract over one hundred thousand people. The height for the French musical scene is reached every year during the Francofolies. The festival attracts international artists from La Francophonie, popular artists from the Quebec musical scene, and emerging artists noticed during preceding festivals. Montreal's English-speaking music scene also succeeds in getting attention from popular media around the world. The growing success of the current variety of artists and bands, with Arcade Fire arguably leading the way, owes much to the city's culture of melting together different genres of music present from many different cultures. A variety of music festivals and independent local record labels also helps sustain this success. Other Montreal bands include Wolf Parade, Mobile, the Unicorns, and Simple Plan. The Montreal International Jazz Festival illustrates well this melting of genres. Far from limiting itself to classical jazz (a style that Montreal always represented with jazzmen such as Oscar Peterson and Oliver Jones), it features a great variety of artists who have espoused rhythms and styles from around the world. Smaller musical festivals include Festival International Nuits Afrique (\\"African Nights\\"), Montreal Reggae Festival, Pop Montreal, FestiBlues international de Montréal, Mutek electronic music festival, and Osheaga rock festival. Every Sunday in Parc Mont-Royal near-downtown Montreal, there is a huge impromptu drumming festival in which hundreds of drummers are invited to jam. Tam Tams.http://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g155032-c105206/Montreal:Quebec:A.Perfect.Sunday.In.The.Park.html =Theatre= Theatre in Montreal is dominated by French-language productions, in part because Montreal has traditionally been a centre for most successful Quebec plays. As a result, the most celebrated and internationally recognized Quebec playwrights have all worked in Montreal at some point, including Michel Tremblay (Les Belles Soeurs, Hosanna), who revolutionized Quebec theatre by writing in the local dialect, joual, and Montreal-adoptee Wajdi Mouawad (Wedding Day at the Cromagnons, Scorched). Most established French-language theatres are found in the Quartier Latin (e.g. Théâtre du Rideau Vert) or near Place des Arts (Théâtre du Nouveau Monde, Théâtre Jean-Duceppe). The city also hosts the Festival TransAmériques, a two-week showcase of international experimental theatre. In contrast, English theatre struggled but survived with the Centaur Theatre. In 1979, David Fennario achieved notable success and notoriety with Canada's first bilingual play, Balconville, which documents rivalries between the English and French working class in the suburb of Pointe-St-Charles. Ethnic theatre, by the 70s, began to be a force, notably with the Black Theatre Workshop under the leadership of artistic director Tyrone Benskin, the Yiddish Theatre established at the Saidye Bronfman Centre and later with the Teesri Duniya and Dummies Theatre. In late 1990s, Montreal started to become a hotspot for low-budget independent English theatre with companies such as Optative Theatrical Laboratories, Infinithéâtre, MainLine Theatre, Gravy Bath Theatre, Sa Booge, Persephone, Pumpkin Productions, and Tableau D'Hôte Theatre adding to the scene. More recently theatre has been taking a more activist turn with emerging organizations such as ATSA and the Optative Theatrical Laboratories, and festivals such as the Anarchist Theatre Festival, MAYWORKS, and the Infringement Festival. =Literature= Montréal has a rich, yet still relatively young literary history in both French and English literature. A large number of novels have captured the realities of Montreal. While any list will understandably be subjective, a few works are agreed to be important in Canadian and Québécois literature. Written in 1947, Gabrielle Roy's The Tin Flute (in French Bonheur d'occasion), which chronicles the life of a young woman in the neighborhood of St-Henri, marked Québécois literature for its urban texture. The work of Mordecai Richler, highlighted by The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz (1959), depicts the lives of poor English- speaking residents of Mile End. Mostly Michel Tremblay perhaps best summarizes the alienation of poor working-class Montréalais at the onset of the Quebec Quiet revolution. The all-time best-selling novel in Québécois literature, Yves Beauchemin's The Alley Cat (Le Matou), depicts a relatively similar neighborhood twenty years later. The later work of Émile Ollivier, for example La Brûlerie, is a portrait of French-speaking immigrants establishing their lives in the Côte-des-Neiges neighborhood. The nineteenth-century poet Émile Nelligan, whom American critic Edmund Wilson famously called \\"the only first- rate Canadian poet, French or English,\\" has many schools and libraries named in his honour in Montreal and around Quebec. Montreal was also the centre of literary modernism in English Canada, led by the Montreal Group of poets including A.M. Klein and F. R. Scott in the mid-1920s. Montreal hosts a number of events related to literature, including the multilingual Blue Metropolis Montreal International Literary Festival, which takes place every Spring and the Expozine alternative press fair every fall. Cult MTL is a local print publication and website in Montreal focusing on culture, music, film, arts and city life. =Film= There are plenty of English-language screens in the city, mostly downtown. The largest and most modern are the central Paramount Montreal and the AMC Forum, both located on Ste-Catherine Street. In addition to presenting movies from the majors, the AMC Forum also presents independent movies of repertory cinema. Other cinemas concentrating on repertory movies include the Cinéma du Parc. Cineastes have on occasion chosen Montreal for their movies. See Montreal in films. Museums Redpath Museum Montreal has a vast network of museums, art galleries and exhibition centres. The Montreal Museum of Fine Arts possess a varied collection of European, First Nations, Inuit, and Canadian arts, including important paintings from Montreal's own Betty Goodwin, James Wilson Morrice and Paul-Émile Borduas. The Musée d'art contemporain has concentrated its collection mainly to emerging post-war Quebec artists, with arguably some of the best artistic works in Quebec from Alfred Pellan and Jean-Paul Riopelle. Other praised museums are the Redpath Museum, the Stewart Museum, the McCord Museum of Canadian History, the Canadian Centre for Architecture, and the Montreal Museum of Archeology and History. The region is also home to a number of science-related museums. Many of them are located in the Olympic Park complex, including the Montreal Biodome (which reproduces four ecosystems of The Americas), the Montreal Insectarium, the Montreal Botanical Garden and the Montreal Planetarium. On the West Island, the Ecomuseum draws many visitors, and features an outdoor setting complete with animals native to the area. A recent addition to Montreal's museum scene is the Montreal Science Centre located in the Old Port, and featuring many hands-on experiments in various fields of science. The Laval Cosmodome houses both Space Camp Canada and the Space Science Centre. A short drive south in Granby, is the Granby Zoo, notable for its wide variety of animals and amusements. Linguistic groups =Francophone= Montreal is the cultural centre of Québec, French-speaking Canada and French- speaking North America as a whole, and an important city in the Francophonie. It is the largest French-speaking city in North America, and the cultural capital of the Quebec province. The city is a hub for French-language television productions, radio, theatre, circuses, performing arts, film, multimedia and print publishing. The best talents from French Canada and even the French-speaking areas of the United States converge in Montreal and often perceive the city as their cultural capital. Montreal is also the most important stop in the Americas for Francophone artists from Europe, Africa and Asia. Some 30 years after the adoption of the Charter of the French Language, a greater number of first- or second-generation immigrants have established themselves in Montreal, such as playwright Wajdi Mouawad (Lebanese origin), singer Nicolas Ciccone (Italian origin), and author Dany Laferrière (Haitian origin), who all contribute to Quebec's culture. =Anglophone= Montreal is also the cultural capital for English Quebec. The Montreal Gazette newspaper, McGill University, and the Centaur Theatre are traditional hubs of Anglo culture. The cultural divide between Montreal's and Canada's Francophone and Anglophone culture was strong and was famously referred to as the Two Solitudes by Canadian writer Hugh MacLennan. Reflecting their deep-seated colonial roots, the Solitudes were historically strongly entrenched in Montreal, splitting the city geographically at Saint Laurent Boulevard. This split, however, has become less and less apparent in the past decades. Although Anglophones still concentrate in the Montreal boroughs on the west side of the island, they have become more bilingual, as 66% of Quebec Anglophones claim to be able to carry on a conversation in French. Thus, while tensions can occur between Anglophones and Francophones, contemporary Montreal is home to a diverse collection of cultures and people who generally live together amicably. =Cultural contribution from other communities= Other cultural communities, be it first-generation immigrants or long-time settlers in Montreal, have greatly contributed to the originality and flavor of Montreal. Many festivals and parades are organized to celebrate the contribution of these communities, such as the Irish Saint Patrick Parade, the Greek Independence Day Parade or the Festival des Nuits d'Afrique. Montreal's Jewish community has been a leading contributor to Montreal's cultural landscape and is renowned for its level of charitable giving and its plethora of cultural and social service community institutions. Among these are the world-renowned Jewish Public Library of Montreal, Segal Centre for the Arts, Museum of Jewish Montreal and Montreal Holocaust Memorial Centre. Religion Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral Nicknamed ' (\\"the city of a hundred belltowers\\"), Montreal is renowned for its churches. Indeed, as Mark Twain once noted, \\"This is the first time I was ever in a city where you couldn't throw a brick without breaking a church window.\\" The city has four Roman Catholic basilicas: Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral, the aforementioned Notre-Dame Basilica, St. Patrick's Basilica, and Saint Joseph's Oratory. The Oratory is the largest church in Canada, with the largest dome of its kind in the world after that of Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome. Saint Joseph's Oratory is the largest church in Canada. Other well-known churches include Notre-Dame- de-Bon-Secours Chapel, which is sometimes called the Sailors' Church, and the Anglican Christ Church Cathedral, which was completely excavated and suspended above an excavated pit during the construction of part of the Underground City. All of the above are major tourist destinations, particularly Notre-Dame and the Oratory. The dominant religion in Quebec is Christianity, which is adhered to by roughly 90.2% of the population. Montreal is the seat of a diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Church. Cuisine Of note is the regional variation, the Montreal hot dog. But Montreal's culinary landscape is perhaps most influenced by the diverse fabric of its ethnic communities. Italian, Greek, Jewish, and Lebanese communities have contributed to the mix of Montreal's restaurants. Jewish contributions include two world-renowned items, Montreal smoked meat sandwiches and Montreal style bagels. Lebanese falafels and shish taouk sandwiches, and Japanese sushi, have become much-appreciated cuisines. This wide variety of cuisines underlines the fact that Montreal is one of the cities in the world with the highest number of restaurants. Montreal and its culinary landscape was the focus of Gourmet magazine's March 2006 issue. Montreal's unique cuisine has also given birth to a number of Montreal-centric restaurants and restaurant chains, such as Dagwoods, Dic Ann's Hamburgers, Dunn's Famous, Moishes Steakhouse, Schwartz's and Lafleur Restaurants. Tourism Tourism is an important industry in Montreal. The city welcomed 14 million visitors in 2005.Communaute Metropolitaine de Montreal - Statistics Like the province of Quebec, visitors to Montreal come from around the world, most of them from the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Mexico and Japan. 39,000 jobs in Montreal were generated by the tourism industry in 2005. Crescent Street in Downtown Montreal is popular among tourists. Throughout the summer, it features various street fairs and festivals. Among locals, Crescent Street is known better for its many clubs and bars. Saint-Laurent Boulevard and the surrounding Plateau Mont-Royal neighbourhood are also well known for their restaurants, bars, nightlife and nightclubs.Montreal's Guide and Events =Festivals= Lantern Festival at the Botanical Garden The plaza on Place des Arts is the home of the most important events during several musical festivals, including the Montreal International Jazz Festival and Montreal Francofolies, a festival of French-language music. two festivals last seven-to-ten days. performances are presented indifferent places, from relatively small clubs to the large halls of Place des Arts. Some of the outdoor shows are held on cordoned-off streets while others are in terraced parks. The city's most popular festival, in terms of attendance, is the Just For Laughs Festival, held annually in July, is also the world's largest comedy festival. The Montreal Fireworks Festival also attracts a lot of attention. On the evenings of competition, tens of thousands of people watch the fireworks for free on their roofs or from locations nearby the competition. Other festivals in Montreal include Pop Montreal, The Fringe Festival, la Fête des Neiges de Montréal,Snow Festival and Nujaz. Annual family-oriented events promoting health and cycling are also organized in the streets of Montreal. Parades are also popular in downtown Montreal. Montreal is also famous as the birthplace of the Infringement Festival, a reaction to the perceived corporatization of the Montreal Fringe Festival. The Infringement has since spread to many other cities in North America and Europe. =Night life= During the period of Prohibition in the United States, Montreal became well known as one of North America's \\"sin cities\\" with unparalleled nightlife, a reputation it still holds today. In part, its bustling nightlife is attributed to its relatively late \\"last call\\" (3 a.m.), a large university population, the drinking age of 18, and the excellent public transportation system combines with other aspects of the Montreal culture to make the city's night life unique. The diversity of the clubs in Montreal attests to the popularity of its night life, with night clubs, pubs, bars and singing bars (\\"boîte à chanson\\"), Latin clubs, African clubs, jazz clubs, lounges, after-hours houses, and strip clubs all attracting different types of customers. The most active parts during Montreal night life are the Downtown and the Quartier Latin. Saint-Denis street, which goes across the Quartier Latin, attracts a majority of the French-speaking population. Saint- Laurent Street (known locally as \\"the Main\\") is also one of the most popular streets. A majority of English-speaking Montrealers frequent the western part of the Downtown, with Crescent Street being one of the most popular streets in this sector. These three streets are all crossed by Downtown's most commercial street, Sainte-Catherine Street, which extends to its East in the heart of Montreal gay night life.

In parliament Barnes was associated with the more radical wing of the Liberals, due to his support for a number of social reforms.The Downfall of the Liberal Party 1914–1935 by Trevor Wilson In particular he favoured the introduction of a Capital levy which in 1919 put him at odds with the caretaker Liberal Leader Sir Donald Maclean. Radical Liberals had proposed a Commons motion to introduce a capital levy which MacLean had failed to support. Barnes publicly criticised MacLean at that year's National Liberal Federation conference.Manchester Guardian, 28 November 1919 He was strong supporter of Free Trade and served as Honorary secretary of the Cobden Club from 1920–1924.'BARNES, Major Harry', Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920–2014; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014 ; online edn, April 2014 accessed 18 Aug 2014 At the 1922 election he sought re-election again as the official Liberal candidate. Although he did not have a Unionist opponent, he found he was also opposed by a National Liberal supporter of the recently deposed Prime Minister, Lloyd George. This had the effect of splitting the Liberal vote with unfortunate consequences; In December 1922 his successful Labour opponent died causing a by-election. He was again selected as the Liberal candidate. By then relations between Lloyd George and Asquith were improving and he faced no National Liberal candidate. However, a Unionist candidate intervened in the by-election with the same effect; He decided to try his luck elsewhere and stood in Tynemouth at the 1923 general election. Tynemouth had been a Unionist seat since they gained it from the Liberals in 1918. He did well, but not quite well enough; He contested Tynemouth again at the 1924 election, but in a difficult year for the Liberal Party his return to parliament was again thwarted; He was also involved in local government politics in London. He served as an Alderman on the London County Council from 1923–1925, for the Liberal backed Progressive Party.'BARNES, Major Harry', Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920–2014; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014 ; online edn, April 2014 accessed 18 Aug 2014 In September 1927 Barnes was selected as Liberal prospective parliamentary candidate for the Unionist seat of Warwick and Leamington.Western Daily Press, Bristol 26 September 1927 However, he was not called upon to contest the seat at an election. In 1928, Barnes instead contested a July by-election in the West Yorkshire seat of Halifax, following the resignation of the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Henry Whitley, who had represented the seat as Liberal since 1900. This seemed to represent his best chance of returning to parliament but he was to be disappointed; He did not stand for Parliament again. At the 1934 LCC Elections he stood as a Labour candidate at Fulham East and was elected. He served as Chairman of the LCC's Town Planning Committee.

Born in Lincolnshire, England, he emigrated to the United States as a young man after being ordained as a Methodist minister. He served in parishes in Nevada and Southern California, gradually beginning his journalism and writing career. An editor of two magazines, he also wrote more than 40 books and many articles and pamphlets on California and the American Southwest. Biography George Wharton James was born in Lincolnshire, England. He married and was ordained as a Methodist minister. He and his wife immigrated to the United States in 1881. He served in parishes in Nevada and southern California. However, in 1889 his wife sued for divorce, accusing him of committing numerous acts of adultery. He was tried by the Methodist Church, charged with real estate fraud, using faked credentials, and sexual misconduct. He was defrocked, although he was later reinstated. In addition to writing his own books, James was associate editor of The Craftsman (1904–05), and editor of Out West (1912–14). and In the style of the times, he was a popular lecturer in the region. He also lectured at both the Panama-Pacific and Panama-California expositions 1915–16. James had a long-running feud with Charles Fletcher Lummis, a California writer with similar regional interests.Starr, Kevin (1985). Inventing the Dream: California through the Progressive Era. New York: Oxford University Press. Both men also explored the American Southwest, becoming acquainted with Father Anton Docher, a French-born missionary priest who served at Pueblo of Isleta in New Mexico for 34 years. James's books included the well-received The Wonders of the Colorado Desert (1906), Through Ramona's Country (1909), In and Out of the Old Missions of California (1905), and The Lake of the Sky (1915). Characteristics of his writing included romanticism, an enthusiasm for natural environments, idealization of aboriginal lifeways, and promotion of health fads. After his divorce, James married again, living in Pasadena, California with his second wife at 1098 North Raymond Avenue. Writer Lawrence Clark Powell later described James's home as serving as \\"a kind of museum salon in the same way that El Alisal served as the center for his rival booster Lummis' Los Angeles followers.

He was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy (ARA) in 1954 and a Royal Academician (RA) in 1963. Early years Born in Woolwich, England, Aldridge grew up in a comparatively wealthy military family. After attending Uppingham School in Rutland, Aldridge studied ‘Greats’ at Corpus Christi College at Oxford University and graduated in 1928 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. After finishing university, Aldridge settled in London, taught himself to paint and held his first mixed exhibition in 1931. Beginning of career as artist Aldridge's pen and ink drawing of San Severo and a pencil drawing of the same scene, circa 1944 or 1945. The pencil drawing is on the back of an aerial reconnaissance photograph. Aldridge exhibited with the 'Seven and Five Society' at the Leicester Galleries from 1931 to 1933. In 1933, he presented his first one man-show at the Leicester Galleries in London and in 1934 he exhibited at the Venice Biennale art exhibition in Italy. During this period and for the rest of his life, Aldridge associated with the British poet Robert Graves and the poets and artists centred on him in the village of Deià, Mallorca. In 1933, at age 28, Aldridge, and his cats, moved to Great Bardfield in the Essex countryside and acquired 'Place House'. He quickly became a friend of his neighbour, Edward Bawden, himself a painter. The two artists collaborated in designing ‘Bardfield’ wallpapers during the later 1930s, which were distributed by Cole & Sons, a British wallpaper company. In 1941, Aldridge joined the British Intelligence Corps as an officer interpreting aerial photographs. After leaving the army in 1945, Aldridge returned to landscape painting. Although he was a skilled 'plein air' painter, many works were produced in his studio at his home; his subjects were the Essex countryside, scenes from his many visits to Italy and to Mallorca, and his much-loved garden at Place House. Great Bardfield Starting in 1949, Aldridge taught at the Slade School for Fine Arts of University College London, under the realist painter Sir William Coldstream. At the same time, other artists started moving to Great Bardfield, making the village a dynamic centre for the visual arts. Aldridge and his wife Cecelia Lucie Leeds Aldridge (née Saunders, a divorcee) frequently opened Place House for summer exhibitions in the village. These well-organised shows attracted thousands of art lovers. In 1955, Aldridge told a London Observer reporter that “people seem to prefer this domestic informality to galleries”. At these summer exhibitions, Aldridge exhibited his oils while Lucy exhibited her hand-knitted rugs. Although Aldridge's work was well-received, it seemed the most conservative of the Great Bardfield Artists as it possibly reflected the art scene of the 1920s and 1930s in Britain. The early 1960s saw the Bardfield art community fragment but Aldridge would remain in Place House until his death. After his 1970 divorce, Aldridge married Gretl Cameron, the widow of his poet friend Norman Cameron. In 1980, on Aldridge's 75th birthday, London's New Grafton Gallery held a retrospective on his work. He died in 1983, his wife Gretl having deceased a few months earlier. Legacy *Aldridge's art work is with the British Council and in the London collections of the Tate Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the Royal Academy. *The major holding of Aldridge's work is in the North West Essex Collection of the Fry Art Gallery in Saffron Walden, Essex. In 1999, the Fry Art Gallery presented a show of his oils and in 2000 an exhibition of his drawings and prints. An exhibition of his landscape oils and other works from across his career was held at the Fry from 7 September to 27 October 2013.

It was originally used as a poorhouse and is the oldest surviving building built for housing the poor in Connecticut, as well as one of the oldest such in the United States. and One of the largest structures of the Federal period in Middletown, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. History The Town of Middletown built the Alms House in 1814 to house the town's poor. Many of the people housed there were required to work, either in the Alms House or in a local industrial business. The building at 53 Warwick Street served as a poorhouse until 1853, when the institution was moved to the Middletown Town Farms facility on Silver Street in the town's South Farms district. Shortly after, the Hubbard and Curtis Hardware Company occupied the building. This company, which manufactured tools, hardware, and wood-burning stoves, had its principal place of commerce on Main Street (359 Main Street) and manufactured its goods in this building. In the early 20th century, Fred I. Hodge, Sr. owned the Middletown Fire Arms and Specialty which manufactured valve wheels and guns. The Middletown Rifle Club had a rifle range in the basement and Hodge also repaired automobiles there. By 1981, C.B. Stone Inc., a home heating oil dealer, had occupied the building since the early 1930s. It is currently used for offices.  Description  The three-and-a-half-story building is constructed in the Federal style and made of brick with Flemish bond and a brownstone foundation with an asphalt shingle roof. The architect and builder are unknown. A graphic depiction on an 1825 map indicates that the building was originally embellished by a segmental arch over the entrance door and a classical cupola. A central, slightly projecting, pavilion is still discernible. The building has a structural system of load-bearing masonry with a gable roof. Located to the north on the premises, facing Warwick Street, is a late-Victorian brick residence. This substantial structure, once owned by Mayor Leo B. Santangelo, displays intricate stickwork on the veranda, and decorative brickwork, and is in relatively original condition. The southeast section of this structure is supported by large brownstone blocks. These blocks are the remains of a jail which was built on the Alms House grounds in 1846. It was a small facility, containing only twelve cells, with the principal jail being in Haddam. This structure, which faces north, sits on a lot on the south side of residential Warwick Street. It is set back from the road behind two late-19th-century houses. A large oak tree to the west shades it.

He aided Mughal Emperor Humayun in his reconquest of the Subcontinent. He is considered a folk hero of the Baloch people and an important figure in the Baloch epic Hani and Sheh Mureed. Mir Chakar Khan Rind University of Technology is named after him. Family According to Baloch history, Mir Chakar Rind is a descendant of Sayyid Al- Shuhada Ameer Hamza ibn Abdul Muttalib. As his name suggests, he is also a direct descendant of Rind Khan, the son of the founder of Baloch Jalal Khan, and the brother of the other founders of the main Baloch tribes King Hoth, Lashar Khan, Kora Khan and Bibi Jato. Mir Chakar Rind lived near Mand, Balochistan. His descandents moved to different parts of the region. They carry his name Rind Baloch. History He became the head of Rind tribe at the age of 18 after the death of his father Mir Shehaq Rind. Mirjat Chakar's fiefdom was short-lived because of a civil war between the Lashari and Rind tribes of Balochistan. Mir Chakar as head of his tribe went to war, which resulted in thousands of dead. The war and the gallantry of the two tribe leaders continues to be a part of the Baloch peoples' history. After the \\"Thirty Years' War\\" against the Lashari Tribe. Mir Chakar Rind defeated the Lasharis. Mir Chakar was a very brave man who desired to make the Baloch nation powerful. When Mir Chakar left Dhadar, his next stop was Sanghar Desert, in Taunsa, Dera Ghazi Khan. He ruled the Sanghar area for many years. No one could defeat Mir Chakar and his army until Mir Doda Khan arrived with his army. Although Mir Chakar had defeated Mir Doda once before, Mir Doda was badly frozen. Mir Doda Khan defeated Mir Chakar in the desert of Sanghar, after which Mir Chakar and his army left Sanghar and moved to the Multan area where he shook hands with the Multan king. On the other side, Shehmureed had gone to Arabia. After Shehmureed, one of his best fighters was Mir Malagh Khan Rind. It is said that Mir Malagh Khan's sword weighed . No one but Mir Malagh could handle it. Mir Qaiser Khan, Mir Sanjar Khan and Mir Mandar Khan were some of Mir Chakar's best fighters. Mir Chakar and the Multan king then planned to conquer Delhi. The Multan king asked for Mir Chakar's help, and he gave him his best fighters. The Lashkar (campaign) was led by Mir Malagh Khan and Mir Qaiser Khan, who went and they conquered Delhi. After this, the Delhi king purportedly said, \\"There was not a single nail uncovered of the Baloch. Their head could reach the glaring sun. They were united; they were brave!\\" On the other side, Mir Doda was gaining power. His grandsons Mir Ghazi Khan and Mir Ismail Khan were his best fighters. The Dera Ghazi Khan and Dera Ismail Khan districts of Pakistan are named after these two. The Multan king invited Mir Doda to dinner. When Mir Doda came, the Multan king said that from then on he would be his left hand. Mir Chakar became angry and planned to attack Mir Doda. In the battle, Mir Doda was badly defeated and his people and army moved to Sindh and never came back. Near the desert of Sanghar he built 100 houses for his relatives to live in, and he named the place Sokar which is now part of Taunsa. This place is still located near the Sanghar desert in Tehsil Taunsa, Dera Ghazi Khan District. Mir Malagh Khan also lived there as he was the best fighter of Mir Chakar. Malghani Balochs are the descendants of this great man. Now Sokar is the hometown of Malghani Baloch Tribe. Mir Chakar then settled in Satghara, Okara and gained power and respect in the area. Sher Shah Suri sent a message to Mir Chakar to unite with him and consolidate his gains. Mir Chakar appreciated the offer but refused to help Sher Shah Suri. Under the command of his son, Mir Shahdad Khan, his forces instead joined the Mughal army of Emperor Humayun in 1555 after a long exile in Persia. Emperor Humayun came back, recaptured Delhi, and ousted the Suri dynasty in 1556. As a reward, Emperor Humayun conferred a vast Jagir (lands), including horses and slaves, to Mir Chakar. He ruled this territory until he died in 1565. People who accompanied Mir Chakar to Satghara after leaving Balochistan constructed a tomb for his body. Noori Naseer Khan of Kalat and Meer Chakar are both Baloch heroes.  Historical Documents  The name Chakar is written differently. Briggs in his translation gives the - Mir Jakar Zand; a lithographed edition of Lucknow from Firishta gives while the British Museum. Tarikh-i-Sher Shahi in E.D., iv 389-397 gives - Chakur Rind correctly.

The street and market are named for Albert Cuyp, a painter from the 17th century. A shop in the market The market began as an ad hoc collection of street traders and pushcarts. By the beginning of the 20th century, this had become so chaotic that in 1905, the city government decided to set up a market, at first only held on Saturday evenings. In 1912, the market became a daytime market open six days a week. Originally the street was accessible while the market was taking place, but more recently the street has been completely closed off to traffic during market hours. The product selection at the market varies from the traditional range of vegetables, fruit and fish to clothing and even cameras. There are many products sold that are of interest to the city's residents of Surinamese, Antillean, Turkish, and Moroccan origin, giving the market and neighbourhood a strong multicultural feel. Stroopwafel making at Albert Cuyp Market The market is the busiest in all of the Netherlands and is reputedly the largest daytime market in Europe. It is also an important tourist attraction. The famous Dutch Stroopwafels are prepared fresh here. Also popular are the many ethnic restaurants and bars that are found behind the market stalls.

All steps along the manufacturing process, and more, must be taken into account in the design of the package for any given product. Package engineering is an interdisciplinary field integrating science, engineering, technology and management to protect and identify products for distribution, storage, sale, and use. It encompasses the process of design, evaluation, and production of packages. It is a system integral to the value chain that impacts product quality, user satisfaction, distribution efficiencies, and safety. Package engineering includes industry-specific aspects of industrial engineering, marketing, materials science, industrial design and logistics. Packaging engineers must interact with research and development, manufacturing, marketing, graphic design, regulatory, purchasing, planning and so on. The package must sell and protect the product, while maintaining an efficient, cost-effective process cycle. Engineers develop packages from a wide variety of rigid and flexible materials. Some materials have scores or creases to allow controlled folding into package shapes (sometimes resembling origami ). Packaging involves extrusion, thermoforming, molding and other processing technologies. Packages are often developed for high speed fabrication, filling, processing, and shipment. Packaging engineers use principles of structural analysis and thermal analysis in their evaluations. Education Some packaging engineers have backgrounds in other science, engineering, or design disciplines while some have college degrees specializing in this field. Formal packaging programs might be listed as package engineering, packaging science, packaging technology, etc. BE, BS, MS, M.Tech and PhD programs are available. Students in a packaging program typically begin with generalized science, business, and engineering classes before progressing into industry- specific topics such as shelf life stability, corrugated box design, cushioning, engineering design, labeling regulations, project management, food safety, robotics, RFID tags, quality management, package testing, packaging machinery, tamper-evident methods, recycling, computer-aided design, etc. See also * Packaging and labelling *Packing problems *Queueing theory *Engineering economics *Manufacturing engineering Notes Bibliography * Yam, K.

Born from the ashes of the underground cult group Loschi Dezi, the band draws its influences from world music, especially Mediterranean, African, Arabic and Latin traditions.Chamberland, 2001. pp.198-204 They mainly sing in native Piedmontese. The band's name has a double meaning: it references the Kenyan Mau Mau uprising against British colonial rule, and in Piedmontese, Mau Mau designates \\"people who come from afar\\".  Biography  The band released their first EP, Soma la macia (We are the scrub) in 1992. Sung in Piedmontese, the EP attracted the attention of Peter Gabriel, who invited them to record their first full album at his Real World Studios. The result was Sauta Rabel (Let's Jump, Let's Make Such a Row), which won a Club Tenco (IT) award for best debut album. It was followed by a tour of festivals, including appearances at the Palestine International Dance & Music Festival and the International Festival of Babylon in Iraq. In 1994, Mau Mau returned to Real World Studios to record their second album, titled Bàss paradis (Low Paradise). The lead single from the album, \\"La Ola\\", achieved significant radio airplay. The album which the band dedicated to people who suffered under colonialism, was released in quite a few European countries, as well as in Japan, and was followed by a tour numbering over 100 performances. Their third album, Viva Mamanera, was released in 1996. It was recorded with Eric Sarafin in Los Angeles, Paris (including in the Paris Metro) and Turin. The album includes more electronic sounds than earlier releases, and was successful in Italy and in France. In the summer of 1996 the band played to over seventy thousand people when they opened for Paolo Conte at the Paleo Festival in Nyon. Subsequently, the principle band members travelled to Morocco to study Arab culture and to work with artists of different backgrounds. The result of this experience was Eldorado, the band's 1998 album. It includes a collaboration with the \\"Meninos do Pelo\\" (the street urchins of Salvador de Bahia). The promotional tour began at the \\"Feira das Mentiras\\", Manu Chao's festival in Santiago de Compostela, (Galicia). After the tour, the band organized the \\"PiemontAfrique Festival\\" in Turin to promote the Africans culture. In 2000, EMI released Safari Beach, the fifth album of the band, a collaboration with Sargento Garcia. The album was less successful than earlier releases.

Built in 1745, it is a center- chimney colonial style house built of clapboard siding and brownstone foundation with wood shingle roof; using a structural system of wood frame, post and beam with gable roof. It was built as a residence which is its current use. Relationship to surroundings This colonial saltbox house is sited on a large lot at the rural western edge of Middletown. Screened from the front by bushes, trees, and a stone wall, and on the east by a cedar paling fence, the house is very secluded. A two-story gambrel-roofed wing on the west, a two-car garage on the north, and a large nineteenth-century barn south of the house complete the estate. Significance This house was the home of Nehemiah Hubbard, a prominent banker and merchant of late eighteenth- century Middletown. The land, part of an original tract, belonged to the Hubbard family, noted early settlers of the town, for a number of generations. Nehemiah was in the fourth generation of Middletown Hubbards. Although the house was some distance from the commercial section of Middletown, Hubbard used the property as a home and for extensive farming operations. Nehemiah Hubbard was Deputy Quartermaster for Middletown during the American Revolutionary War, and was the first President of the Middletown Bank. The house remained in the Hubbard family through the nineteenth century. Early in the 20th century, it was the home of Thomas McDonough Russell, Sr. This 1744 center-chimney saltbox retains most of its early features, both interior and exterior. The main fireplace with its beehive oven measures over eight feet wide. Much early hardware remains. The two-story gambrel-roofed \\"kitchen wing\\" is added, but is sympathetic in style with the original house. The house underwent restoration in 1929 by the Colonel Wadsworth family. It continues to be used as a residence. See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Middletown, Connecticut References * Middletown, Connecticut Historical and Architectural Resources.

History In 1918, Paul Laurence Dunbar High School opened around the corner from its present location as the Paul Laurence Dunbar Elementary School, No. 101. The original school was part of the segregated \\"colored schools\\" system, which was abolished by 1954. The present school is part of the Baltimore City Public Schools system. It was named in memory of Paul Laurence Dunbar, a famous African-American poet, who had died twelve years before the school opened. In 1925, it was renamed Dunbar Junior High School, No. 133. In 1940, Dunbar became a high school and awarded its first diploma, the second school for African-Americans in Baltimore to do so. Dunbar's temporary location during renovations In the summer of 2007, after thirty years of heavy use, the main high school building was emptied for renovations. Students were moved to Thomas G. Hayes Elementary School, behind Dunbar at 601 North Central Avenue. The renovations were completed in late August 2009 with costs totaling $32 million. Newly renovated features include science and robotics labs, wider interior hallways, larger windows, a new cafeteria, and a new library. Academics Dunbar High School is a magnet school, offering biotechnology, emergency medical technology (EMT), accounting, nursing, and health care delivery systems programs. Dunbar High School has been named a Bronze Medal School by U.S. News and World Report. Athletics The male varsity sports offered at Dunbar are baseball, basketball, football, soccer, and wrestling. The women's varsity sports offered are badminton, basketball, soccer, softball, and volleyball. The four varsity teams that are coed are cross country, swimming, indoor track and field, and outdoor track and field. =Football= The Baltimore City Public Schools withdrew from the Maryland Scholastic Association (MSA) in 1993, its long-time home since 1909 and the home of the formerly segregated schools, Dunbar and Douglass, since 1956. The schools then joined the larger, statewide Maryland Public Secondary Schools Athletic Association (MPSSAA), and since then Dunbar has had great success in the class 1A division. The Dunbar football team, the Poets, won state championships in 1994, 1995, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2012, 2013 and 2017. =Basketball= Since 1993, the school's basketball team, the Poets, have won the State Championship fifteen times.

History =Origins= Clement's Inn Passage c1965 In 1842 the Department of Excise set up a laboratory in its Broad Street headquarters to check tobacco for adulteration, i.e. the addition of other substances to increase profits and evade duty. (The amount of tobacco being sold was much greater than that being imported.) It had one employee, George Phillips who used a microscope and chemical tests, most of which he had developed himself. The work of the laboratory expanded to check for adulteration in pepper, beer and coffee with further staff being employed under Phillips, and a new laboratory was opened in Somerset House in 1859, by which time Excise had joined the Inland Revenue. In 1861 it dealt with 11,000 samples. The work also expanded to include foodstuffs and soap and in 1874 Phillips had 12 permanent staff. The Inland Revenue Laboratory as it was now known was appointed a Referee Analyst under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act 1875, i.e. one whose findings were accepted in a court of law. This greatly added to the number of samples being submitted. In 1894 an official Government Laboratory was set up, combining both the Inland Revenue Laboratory and a separate Customs Laboratory which had been set up in 1860, moving to purpose- built premises in Clement's Inn Passage in 1897. The head was Dr Edward Thorpe, with the title of Principal Chemist, who expanded its activities to include health problems caused by the match and lead-glazing industries. His report of 1907 states that 173,606 analyses and examinations were made on behalf of the departments of Customs and Excise, other departments and in connection with two acts, the Food And Drugs Act and the Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs Act. =First Government Chemist= In 1911 the Government Laboratory became an independent department of government (the smallest one under the Treasury) as the Department of the Government Chemist. The Principal, Dr James Dobbie was the first to be given the new title of Government Chemist. The analysis of tobacco remained a substantial part of the work, being greatly increased during World War I because of supplies to troops. Demand increased with interwar legislation, and the Laboratory had to do considerable original research to develop new and better methods of analysis. The number of routine samples between 1920 and 1939 went from 199,388 to 430,314. It was also asked by government to look into methods associated with the carriage of dangerous goods, atmospheric pollution, and the possible dangers to health arising from the use of tetraethyllead in motor fuel. World War II produced a peak demand of 560 354 samples. =Creation of the Laboratory of the Government Chemist= In 1959 the Government Laboratory ceased to be a separate department but instead was under the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, and in 1963 moved to new premises in Cornwall House, Waterloo, London as the Laboratory of the Government Chemist. In 1989 it was changed into an Executive Agency under the Department of Trade and Industry. This gave it the remit to seek outside work (which it already did to a significant extent) and earn income to fully cover costs, while having more management autonomy. It also moved to new premises in Teddington. =Privatization= As part of a general programme of privatization of public services by the government, Michael Heseltine announced that Laboratory of the Government Chemist would become independent non-profit distributing company limited by guarantee, or could possibly be bought by a company or institution which could show that it would still remain sufficiently independent to fulfill its statutory duties. However the undertakings required to meet these obligations indefinitely meant that 40 initial expressions of interest produced only three considered suitable to bid, and no actual bids. A consortium of Laboratory employees, the Royal Society of Chemistry and 3i put together a bid in 1995 which was accepted, taking the form of a management buyout and it became LGC Ltd in February 1996. =Post Privatization= Since privatisation, LGC has changed ownership and significantly expanded its activities. Valued at £3 million when privatized, it was sold for £80 million in 2003 to LGV, part of Legal & General, who sold it in 2010 to Bridgepoint Capital for the sum of £257 million, who in turn sold it in 2015 to KKR. Employee numbers have risen from 270 in 1996 to about 2,800 in 2019, as the company has grown organically and through multiple acquisitions. Significant acquisitions since 1996 include: KBioscience, AGOWA, Forensic Alliance Limited, Mikromol, Promochem, University Diagnostics Ltd, HFL, ARMI, VHG Labs, Quotient Bioanalytical Sciences, Dr Ehrenstorfer, Biosearch Technologies, Thistle QA, Maine Standards, Prime Synthesis, immunosuppressive proficiency testing (PT) scheme from ASI, BRC Global Standards, o2si, Seracare, Lucigen and Bioautomation; and the outsourcing of analytical services from BNG and Sentinel Performance Solutions.

It was partly written during his recuperation from an accident where a runaway bus knocked MacFarquhar off his bicycle on Fifth Avenue in New York City. MacFarquhar's second book, The Media Relations Department of Hizbollah Wishes You a Happy Birthday: Unexpected Encounters in the Changing Middle East, is a journal of MacFarquhar's experiences in the region, starting with his childhood in Col. Gaddafi's Libya, and an assessment of the prospects for political and social change. The book combines aspects of everyday life with the stories of individual men and women working for a freer Middle East. Bibliography * The Sand Café.

Open to any artist working in three dimensions. The award is supported by the Mirisch & Lebenheim Charitable Foundation. = Past winners =  Grizedale Residency  With thanks to the Brian Mercer Charitable Trust the Society offers an annual residency opportunity based at Grizedale Forest. This intensive six week long residency aims to foster experimentation and innovation in response to the natural environment. Past Winners * Karolin Schwab (2019) * Ben Allan (2019)  Spotlight  Founded in 2017, Contemporary Sculpture Fulmer is a private sculpture park in Buckinghamshire which surveys the breadth of contemporary sculptural practice. The park was established with the aim of offering a space for sculptural experimentation, development and dialogue. Alongside the annual exhibition programme, the park creates opportunities for artists to engage, exhibit and share their ideas. The annual spotlight award gives Contemporary Sculpture Fulmer a chance to work directly with the membership of The Royal Society of Sculptors; each year the Society members are invited to apply for the opportunity to present a solo installation within a cleared area of woodland. The successful applicant is selected and mentored through the process by Brooke Benington directors George Marsh and Lily Brooke. There is no restriction to the style, medium or scale of the work but applicants are asked to consider the environment in which the work will ultimately be exhibited.

He established the relief agency Calcutta Rescue. Preger graduated from St Edmund Hall, Oxford with a post-graduate degree in economics and political science. He worked for a few years as a farmer in Wales before selling his farm and deciding to become a doctor instead. In 1965, he was admitted into the Royal College of Surgeons in Dublin at the age of 35.  Work in Bangladesh  In 1972, when he had just finished his internship, although his plans had been to dedicate his life to the poor in South or Central America, and he had prepared himself by learning Spanish, he answered a call over the radio for doctors to help the people of then newly independent Bangladesh. He was soon in Dhaka, where he worked, under squalid conditions, in refugee camps filled with Urdu-speaking people who intended to return to Pakistan. He learnt Urdu and later Bengali. In 1975, he set up a 90-bed clinic in Dhaka and two farms on the outskirts of the city. However, his work in Dhaka came to an abrupt end when he discovered that Dutch non-government organisation Terre des Hommes was operating a child- smuggling racket, and exposed it despite the Bangladesh government warning him not to. He was deported to Bangkok in 1979.  Work in Kolkata  After being deported from Bangladesh, he went to India the same year and worked in Kolkata for six months under Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity. However, Preger criticized the inadequate conditions in Mother Teresa's charities, saying \\"If one wants to give love, understanding and care, one uses sterile needles. This is probably the richest order in the world. Many of the dying there do not have to be dying in a strictly medical sense.\\"http://www.deeshaa.org/wuellenweber-where-are-her- millions/#sthash.874GgD0g.dpuf Preger thought that he would be able to do more if he operated independently, and started a clinic for the poor below the flyover connecting the Howrah Bridge. He also requested a work permit, which ultimately was not given. When carrying medical supplies to and from the bridge proved impractical, Preger moved to Middleton Row located off Park Street where he was offered free storage facilities at a Presbytery. With medicines and equipment now at hand, he set up a clinic on the pavement flanking the Presbytery’s exterior wall. The result was a basic but structured medical facility operating illegally at the side of the road. Partially covered by tarpaulins, it comprised several departments. Preger sat in a central consultation area assisted by local doctors willing to work for a small fee. Medical records were stored here in metal boxes. Physical examinations were conducted behind held-up cloth sheets. An adjoining pharmacy section dispensed medicines. Patients were sent for diagnostic procedures, including radiology and laboratory tests. A treatment area was staffed by volunteers, including several nurses. Many of these were overland travellers who postponed their travel plans to help Preger. This section provided first aid and wound care for ulcers, burns, infections and other conditions. A welfare department gave out vitamins and maternal supplies, plus small sums of money to cover travel costs for patients from rural areas. Serious cases, including cancer and heart disease, were referred to local hospitals for surgery, radiotherapy, or other medical procedures. The clinic was erected at daybreak and dismantled every day at dusk, leaving the sidewalk empty. Supported by donations, all treatment was provided free. Defying threats and demands from street mafia, and conflict with the authorities, Preger operated this clinic six days a week for fourteen years from 1979 to 1993, often treating several hundred patients a day. When Preger received official registration as Calcutta Rescue, he was able to set up legal, permanent clinics. An American doctor called Jim Withers who met Preger on a trip to India in 1993, was inspired to introduce the concept in his home town of Pittsburgh, USA. Withers went on to found the Street Medicine Institute in 2009. As a result, Street Medicine programmes now operate in over 85 cities in 15 countries. Preger became known as “The Pavement Doctor of Calcutta” and today is widely regarded as the founder of street medicine. Today, Calcutta Rescue operates three clinics, two schools and two vocational centres. It employs 150 locally hired staff and international support groups. Support groups for the work of Preger have been formed in several countries, mostly spurred on by tourists returning home, who had witnessed his selfless work : England, Switzerland, France, Germany, Norway, The Netherlands, Canada, the US. = Intervention by the government = In 1980, the Foreigners' Registration Office (FRO) of the West Bengal government noted that Preger had accepted a donation from a missionary organisation based in the United States, and demanded that he declare himself as a missionary worker, in addition to being a doctor. He resolved this only after explaining to New Delhi officials that he was not a missionary worker. (Calcutta Rescue is entirely secular), and was permitted to stay in Kolkata without a visa. In 1981, the FRO charged him with entering India without a missionary visa, but he was released on bail. The FRO dropped the charge in 1989 after intervention by the then high commissioner of New Zealand to India, Sir Edmund Hillary. After Preger registered Calcutta Rescue as a charity in 1991, he started two more clinics in Kolkata and donations came in from eight European countries. He also obtained a resident's permit. However, the government refused to grant him the clearance needed to accept foreign donations. Preger then sued the government in Kolkata's courts. Eventually the courts struck down the government's rejection, and Preger was allowed to accept 1.5 million rupees per month in donations. As of 1999, Preger has to apply for a re-entry visa from the FRO before he leaves India for any reason. Most of these applications have required legal intervention to succeed. On 23 February that year, the FRO suddenly asked Preger to leave India within seven days. The Calcutta High Court intervened by ordering the government to speedily grant him a return visa. Aged 88 and in declining health, Preger retired in January 2019 and returned to the United Kingdom after 40 years of service to the poor in Kolkata. The work continues in his absence. \\"https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/west-bengal/samaritan-jack-preger-s-so- long-to-home-of-four-decades/cid/1680236  Awards  In 1993, Preger was named a Member of the Order of the British Empire for his \\"continued perseverance and incredible selflessness\\".

As an academic discipline, it explores the manner in which groups communicate based on societal, cultural, gender, occupational or other factors. A speech code can also be defined as \\"a historically enacted socially constructed system of terms, meanings, premises, and rules, pertaining to communicative conduct.\\" \\"This theory seeks to answer questions about the existence of speech codes, their substance, the way they can be discovered, and their force upon people within a culture\\" (Griffin, 2005). This theory deals with only one type of human behavior, which is speech acts. A basic definition of speech code by sociologist Basil Bernstein is, \\"...a coding principle is a rule governing what to say and how to say it in a particular context\\".  History and important works Work by Gerry Philipsen has been influential in the development of speech codes theory. Work in the 1960s influences the theory as it stands today in the field of communication. Before speech codes theory got its name Philipsen first referred to this theory as the Ethnography of Communication. He decided to change it because he recognized that many people could not get past the idea of Ethnography as simply a research method. He was considered a naturalist who watched, listened and recorded communicative conduct in a cultures natural setting. Em Griffin stated that, \\"Many people can't get past the idea of ethnography as simply a research method.\\" With that being said, Philipsen moved from description to explanation, resulting in him labeling his work \\"speech codes theory\\". Philipsen's ultimate goal was to develop a theory that would capture the relationship between communication and culture. \\"The Speech Codes theory was created for ultimately two purposes. The first was to distill some of what might be learned from a large body of fieldwork research on culturally distinctive ways of speaking. The second was to provide a focus for further research and discussion. The theory was first published in prototypical form with an introduction to the concept of speech codes and a presentation of four empirically grounded principles about speech codes. It was presented as a formal theoretical statements with five empirical grounded propositions, four of which were carried over intact from the earlier version.\\" (Philipsen, Coutu and Covarrubias).Philipsen, Gerry, Lisa Coutu, and Patricia Covarrubias. Theorizing about Intercultural Communication. 56. Web. 7 Nov. 2012. There were four questions that Philipsen sought to answer through his research on the Speech Code Theory: # the existence of distinctive speech codes # the substance of the speech codes (whether they contained a vocabulary or way of speaking that held meanings for social constructs and worlds). # how speech codes could be observed and formulated. # the force of the speech code in social life. (Philipsen and Albrecht 119-156) Philipsen, Gerry, and Terrance Albrecht. Developing Communication Theories (1997): 119-156. Web. 7 Nov. 2012. Works by Basil Bernstein heavily influenced Philipsen. Bernstein used the term \\"speech codes\\" in sociology and further elaborated on speech codes and their contexts. He stated that, \\"within the same society, there can exist different social groups or social classes whose communicative practices differ in important ways\\" (Philipsen,1997). Bernstein argues that people have different ways of speaking, which shapes and reinforces their understanding of themselves, other people, and social life. Bernstein believes that a coding principle is, \\"a rule governing what to say and how to say it in a particular context.\\" Lisa Coutu, an ethnographer, helped to formulate the second proposition of Speech Codes Theory. This proposition states that within any given speech community, there are multiple speech codes. Her evidence comes from a large body of research surrounding Robert McNamara's book, \\"In Retrospect.\\" Another important influence is the work of anthropologist and linguist Dell Hymes. His focus was on local speech practices in various cultural and social situations.  The S.P.E.A.K.I.N.G. model  Dell Hymes constructed the S.P.E.A.K.I.N.G. model to aid in the search for speech codes in specific speech communities. The letters stand for the following (as reported by Miller): * _S_ ituation (setting or scene) * _P_ articipants (analysis of personalities and social positions or relationships) * _E_ nds (goals and outcomes) * _A_ cts (message form, content, etc.) * _K_ ey (tone or mode) * _I_ nstrumentalities (channels or modalities used) * _N_ orms (framework for producing and processing messages) * _G_ enre (interaction type)  Teamsterville and Nacirema  An often cited study, the \\"Teamsterville\\" study, was conducted by Philipsen in Chicago. The study took place in the late 1960s and early 1970s. According to Miller, the \\"Teamsterville\\" nickname was given to the area of Chicago studied because the primary job of the area's men was truck driving. For three years, Philipsen spoke with everyone he could; from a kid on the corner to the women on their front porches, and men in bars. Although the people all spoke English, Philipsen could recognize the differences between their speech codes and his. As a follow up, another study, the \\"Nacirema\\" (American spelled backwards) study was conducted that contrasted the speech of Teamsterville with that of the average American. The typical Nacirema speech is a \\"generalized U.S. conversation that is carried at the public level and at the interpersonal level in face-to-face interaction.\\"  Six general propositions  Using these two studies above, Philipsen outlined statements that summarize the work within speech code theory. The statements are reported by Em Griffin as follows: 1\\\\. The distinctiveness of speech codes (In any given culture, there is a speech code.) * Each distinctive culture (community) has its own speech codes that are foreign to outsiders. * Two distinctive questions can be asked through Preposition 1. The first being: Does every culture include symbols, meanings, premises, and rules about communicative conduct? The second is: Do such codes differ in terms of the particular words, meanings, premises, and rules about communicative conduct that they include? 2\\\\. The multiplicity of speech codes (Multiple speech codes exist in any given speech community.) * People are affected all the time by other speech codes and may even be involved with multiple codes at the same time. 3\\\\. The substance of speech codes (A speech code has a distinctive psychology, sociology and rhetoric.) * Psychology. According to Philipsen, \\"every speech code \\"thematizes\\" the nature of individuals in a particular way.\\" * Sociology. Philipsen states that, \\"a speech code provides a system of answers about what linkages between self and others can properly be sought, and what symbolic resources can properly and efficaciously be employed in seeking those linkages.\\" * Rhetoric. The discovery of truth and persuasive appeal. Speech codes reveal structures of self, society, and strategic action, no matter the culture. 4\\\\. The meaning of speech codes (The speech community assesses the meanings of speech.) * We must listen to the way people talk within a culture and also how they respond. People within that culture decide what they feel is mere communication, small talk or normal chitchat. 5\\\\. The site of speech codes (The terms, premises, and rules of a speech code are inextricably woven into the speech itself). * In order to understand our own speech codes and even another's we must first analyze the speech of native speakers. 6\\\\. The discursive force of speech codes (Speech Codes impact life.) * Obtaining shared speech codes, participants can guide metacommunication (the talk about talk).  Characteristics  According to Philipsen there are three defining characteristics of the speech codes theory and he illustrated these by referencing Carbaugh's previous study. The first characteristic being that speech codes are, \\"grounded in the observation of communication conduct in particular times and places\\" (Gudykunst, 2005). Speech codes theory is concerned about observing communication conduct through noticing, describing, interpreting and explaining the findings. The second is that speech codes present, \\"a way to interpret or explain observed communicative conduct by reference to situated codes of meaning and value.\\" Different meanings are interpreted in multiple ways depending on that community's discursive life. The last characteristic is that this theory, \\"provides a general understanding of communicative conduct.\\" Philipsen characterizes the Speech Code Theory by stating that, \\"It is general in 3 ways. It presents a characterization of the nature of all speech codes. It contains a general answer to the question of how an observer might systematically try to learn about the particularities of particulars, local ways of speaking. It presents a general answer to the question of how speech codes relate to communicative conduct.\\" According to Gerry Philipsen, the Speech Codes Theory is a historically enacted, socially constructed system of terms, meanings, premises, and rules, pertaining to communicative conduct. One of his six general propositions is that wherever there is a distinctive culture, there is to be found a distinctive speech code. For example, when we are immersed in a new community with a culture that is unfamiliar to us, we often find certain patterns of speech to be strange. Because we are an outsider, we pick up on these differences initially. Yet over time, we grow accustomed to these patterns and no longer notice a difference in pronunciation and/or grammar. Speech codes are seen in the way a group determines when to communicate and what is appropriate to say at a particular time.  Criticisms  Philipsen addresses the criticisms of Speech Code Theory by saying that: 1\\\\. \\"Speech Codes Theory does not account for manifestations of power in discourse. This is a matter of omission in the theoretical assumptions, methodological framework, and examination of fieldwork materials. 2\\\\. Speech Codes Theory treats culture as overly deterministic. A corollary to this is that it reifies culture as a static entity.\\" This is a strong force of conduct within communication. It has a social perspective that directly addresses the issue of \\"a universal possibility in any body of discourse of manifestations of power, solidarity, intimacy\\" and other important aspects of social life.  Examples of places and situations with speech codes  *Within cultures *In workplaces (note that workplaces often also have official speech codes in the legal sense) *Within social groups such as special-interest clubs and organizations. *Bilingual speech codes *Between country culture *Certain geographic subcultures.

In September 2013, Kawamoto sold all of his Hawaii assets to Alexander and Baldwin for $128 million. The transaction was brokered by Steve Sombrero, president of NAI ChaneyBrooks. Born into a wealthy kimono shop owner's family in what is now Kitakyushu, Fukuoka Prefecture, he went to Keio University, but did not graduate. Kāhala Avenue Mission In 2006, Kawamoto announced that he would rent out some of the 18 homes he owns on Kahala Avenue, most purchased for between $2 million and $20 million, to native Hawaiian families for $150 – $200 per month. Controversy Kawamoto owns dozens of office buildings in Tokyo under the name Marugen and has been buying and selling real estate in Hawaii and California since the 1980s, and had been accused of making money by driving real estate values down by various methods such as erecting statues, destroying fences and removing landscaping and buying them out and then selling them when the price increased. He has been criticized for evicting tenants of his rental homes on short notice so he could sell the properties, as in 2002 when he gave hundreds of California tenants 60 days to leave. Two years later, he served eviction notices to tenants in 27 Oahu rental homes, mostly in pricey Hawaii Kai, saying they had to leave within a month. He said he wanted to sell the houses to take advantage of rising prices. Some neighbors were unhappy with Kawamoto's plans, speculating that he was trying to drive down real estate values so he can snap up even more homes. \\"Everyone's paying homage to him, but in reality, he's the problem,\\" said Mark Blackburn, who lives down the street from Kahale's new home when interviewed by CNN on March 2007. \\"Houses are homes.

Together with fellow Tosa samurai Sakamoto Ryōma, he was attracted by the radical pro-Imperial Sonnō jōi movement. After being promoted, he essentially seized power within the Tosa Domain's politics and exerted influence on Tosa daimyō Yamauchi Toyoshige to call on shōgun Tokugawa Yoshinobu to return power peacefully to the Emperor.  Meiji statesman and liberal agitator  After the Meiji Restoration, Gotō was appointed to a number of posts, including that of Governor of Osaka, and sangi (councillor), but later left the Meiji government in 1873 over disagreement with the government's policy of restraint toward Korea (i.e. the Seikanron debate) and, more generally, in opposition to the Chōshū-Satsuma domination of the new government. Jointly with Itagaki Taisuke, he submitted a memorandum calling for the establishment of a popularly elected parliament. In 1874, together with Itagaki Taisuke, and Etō Shinpei and Soejima Taneomi of Hizen Province, he formed the Aikoku Kōtō (Public Party of Patriots), declaring, \\"We, the thirty millions of people in Japan are all equally endowed with certain definite rights, among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty, acquiring and possessing property, and obtaining a livelihood and pursuing happiness. These rights are by Nature bestowed upon all men, and, therefore, cannot be taken away by the power of any man.\\" This anti-government stance appealed to the discontented remnants of the samurai class and the rural aristocracy (who resented centralized taxation) and peasants (who were discontented with high prices and low wages). After the Osaka Conference of 1875, he returned briefly to the government, participating in the Genrōin. He also managed a coal mine in Kyūshū (the Takashima Coal Mine), but finding it to be losing money, sold his interest to Iwasaki Yatarō. In 1881, he returned to politics, assisting Itagaki Taisuke found the Jiyūto (Liberal Party) which developed the daidō danketsu (coalition) movement in 1887.  Meiji bureaucrat  In 1889, Gotō joined the Kuroda administration as Communications Minister, remaining in that post under the first Yamagata cabinet and first Matsukata cabinet. Under the new kazoku peerage system, he was elevated to hakushaku (count). In the second Itō cabinet he became Agriculture and Commerce minister. He was implicated in a scandal involving futures trading, and was forced to retire. After a heart attack, he retired to his summer home in Hakone, Kanagawa, where he died in 1896.

The full line was never completed but a line was opened to Snyder in 1908 and extended another to Fluvanna in September 1909. The line was abandoned between Snyder and Fluvanna prior to 1945, and passenger service ended in 1953. The line between Roscoe and Snyder was abandoned in 1984 because of deregulation associated with the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, which made it difficult for the company to compete.

It is situated in a modestly scaled 19th century urban residential neighborhood. Although integrated into its surroundings, the old high school stands out because of its size and Romanesque Revival style. Significance From a postcard sent in 1909 Built in 1894-1896, this building was Middletown's second high school. The Hartford firm of Curtis & Johnson designed the structure in Romanesque Revival style. The building for which no expense was spared in materials or design, set an innovative standard for the educational facilities of its day. The use of different materials (Pompeian brick, brownstone, and terra cotta) produces a rich textural effect on the exterior. A turret on the northeast corner, the use of round compound arches, and an overall asymmetrical plan are typical of Romanesque Revival. In 1912 a large wing designed by Charles Scranton Palmer of Meriden was added to the south side of the building. This wing closely repeated the materials and stylistic elements of the existing structure. A second large wing containing a library, auditorium, and gymnasium was added to the west side in 1931. Although it incorporates some Romanesque details such as sound compound arched windows and utilized materials compatible to the original, the overall impression is of a separate and distinct construction. The old high school is one of the few monumental civic buildings of the 19th century remaining in Middletown and the only one of the Romanesque style. It ceased operation as a high school in 1973.Middletown, Connecticut Historical and Architectural Resources. Volume II, Card Number 71. John Reynolds. May 1978.

Background Forward Pass was sired by On-and-On, a half-brother to Kentucky Derby winner Tim Tam who is also known as the damsire of Alydar. His dam, Princess Turia, won the 1956 Kentucky Oaks, as well as the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes and Delaware Handicap during her racing career. Princess Turia's other progeny include graded stakes winner Turn to Turia and full brothers to Forward Pass Ever On, Dinamode, and Prince Turian. Prince Turian stood stallion duties in Venezuela, Dinamode stood in the United States at Marablue Farm in Florida, and Ever On had a brief stallion career in the United States at Winston Farm, the farm of his owner Suzanne Perdue. Owned and bred by Calumet Farm, the colt was trained by Henry Forrest. Racing career Racing at age three, Forward Pass won several graded stakes races, including three important U.S. Triple Crown prep races: the Everglades Stakes, the Florida Derby and the Blue Grass Stakes. =1968 Kentucky Derby= The betting favorite going into the 1968 Kentucky Derby, Forward Pass finished second, but winner Dancer's Image was disqualified to last place after traces of phenylbutazone were discovered in the mandatory post-race urinalysis. As a result, Forward Pass was declared the winner. The controversy filled the sporting news of media outlets in North America and was a cover story for Sports Illustrated, which referred to it as \\"the year's major sports story.\\" It was revealed that Dancer's Image had been plagued by sore ankles and on the Sunday prior to the Kentucky Derby, his handlers had a veterinarian give the horse a phenylbutazone tablet, a pain killer commonly used to relieve inflammation of the joints, which was legal at many race tracks in the United States but not at Churchill Downs. However, it was still a legitimate practice, as the medication would dissipate from the horse's system during the six days before the Derby. When the horse's post-Derby urinalysis revealed the phenylbutazone, his owner and handlers believed someone else may have been motivated to give the colt another dose of the drug, and they filed an appeal of the disqualification. The Kentucky State Racing Commission examined the matter and ordered distribution of the purse with first money to Forward Pass. This decision was upheld in April 1972 by Kentucky's highest court in Kentucky State Racing Commission v. Fuller, 481 S.W.2d 298 (Ky, 1972). In a subsequent decision, the Commission ordered that Forward Pass be considered the winner of the 1968 Kentucky Derby and that his owners were to receive the Derby's gold cup. It was not until Country House in 2019 that another horse was declared winner of the Kentucky Derby as the result of a disqualification. =1968 Preakness and Belmont= In a rematch with Dancer's Image in the Preakness Stakes, Forward Pass won by six lengths. As the third leg of the U.S. Triple Crown approached, the Derby controversy raged on. A victory by Forward Pass in the Belmont Stakes would make him the first Triple Crown winner in twenty years and many fans, experts, and racing commentators felt he would be an illegitimate champion. In the Belmont, Forward Pass finished second by one and a quarter lengths to Greentree Stable's colt Stage Door Johnny, a horse who had not raced in the Derby or the Preakness but had been specifically bred and conditioned for competing at longer distances. =Awards= In 1968, the Turf and Sports Digest poll saw Forward Pass named as Champion 3-Yr-Old Male. The other two organizations (Thoroughbred Racing Association and Daily Racing Form) voted for Stage Door Johnny. Retirement and legacy Retired at the end of the 1968 racing season to Calumet Farm, Forward Pass was sent to stand at stud at Calumet Farm. In 1977, he was sold to a breeding farm in Japan. He died there in 1980. Even today, controversy and speculation surrounds the 1968 Kentucky Derby. The New York Times calls the ruling the \\"most controversial decision in all of Triple Crown racing.\\"http://horseracing.about.com/library/weekly/aa060303a.htm The use of phenylbutazone was subsequently approved on March 6, 1974, by the Kentucky Racing Commission in recognition of medical research that showed it does not enhance a horse's performance.

The Chamberlin trimetric projection is a map projection where three points are fixed on the globe and the points on the sphere are mapped onto a plane by triangulation. It was developed in 1946 by Wellman Chamberlin for the National Geographic Society. Chamberlin was chief cartographer for the Society from 1964 to 1971. The projection's principal feature is that it compromises between distortions of area, direction, and distance. A Chamberlin trimetric map therefore gives an excellent overall sense of the region being mapped. Many National Geographic Society maps of single continents use this projection. As originally implemented, the projection algorithm begins with the selection of three points near the outer boundary of the area to be mapped. From these three base points, the true distances to a point on the mapping area are calculated. The distances from each of the three base points are then drawn on the plane by compass circles. Unlike triangulation on a plane where three such compass circles will intersect at a unique point, the compass circles from a sphere do not intersect precisely at a point. A small triangle is generated from the intersections, and the center of this triangle is calculated as the mapped point. A Chamberlin trimetric projection map was originally obtained by graphically mapping points at regular intervals of latitude and longitude, with shorelines and other features then mapped by interpolation. Based on the principles of the projection, precise, but lengthy, mathematical formulas were later developed for calculating this projection by computer for a spherical earth. The Chamberlin trimetric projection is neither conformal nor equal-area. Rather, the projection was conceived to minimize distortion of distances everywhere with the side-effect of balancing between areal equivalence and conformality. This projection is not appropriate for mapping the entire sphere because the outer boundary would loop and overlap itself in most configurations.

Until the Unocal decision in 1985, the Delaware courts had applied the business judgment rule, when appropriate, to takeover defenses, mergers, and sales.See Ross W. Wooten, Comment, Restructurings During a Hostile Takeover: Directors' Discretion or Shareholders' Choice?, 35 Hous. L. Rev. 505, 508-10 (1998) (discussing how Delaware courts have changed the manner by which they review hostile takeover defenses, and indicating that after the Unocal decision, the protection of shareholders is favored over total director discretion). In Unocal, the Court held that a board of directors may only try to prevent a take-over where it can be shown that there was a threat to corporate policy and the defensive measure adopted was proportional and reasonable given the nature of the threat. This requirement has become known as the Unocal test for board of directors (as later modified in Unitrin, Inc. v. American General Corp., which required the tactics to be \\"coercive\\" or \\"preclusive\\" before the court would step in). Background =Facts= Mesa Petroleum had made a front-end loaded two-tiered hostile bid for Unocal Corporation in which the front end was $54 in cash, and the back end of the deal was $54 in junk bonds. Because most shareholders would prefer to receive the cash instead of the bonds, shareholders were expected to tender their shares into the deal, even if they did not think $54 was a fair price. If a shareholder declined to tender, that shareholder risked being cashed-out for $54 in risky debt instruments instead of cash. In response to the Mesa tender offer, Unocal made a self-tender at $72 for all but the Mesa shares. The Unocal board attempted to launch a self-tender offer to combat an unsolicited tender offer by Mesa Petroleum (Mesa).See Unocal Corp. v. Mesa Petroleum Co., 493 A.2d 946, 950 (Del. 1985) (explaining what occurred when Unocal's board met to consider the Mesa tender offer and discussing the impact of presentations at this meeting which focused on the inadequacies of the Mesa proposal). The self-tender offer would be triggered upon Mesa acquiring sixty- four million shares of Unocal, and would mean that Unocal itself would buy- back 49% of the outstanding shares of Unocal - but none of the shares to be bought-back could be shares held by Mesa.See id. at 951 (discussing the terms of the Unocal board resolution and indicating it would be subject to any additional conditions Unocal's officers believed necessary). =Court of chancery= The trial court found that this selective exchange offer was not legally permissible, and issued a preliminary injunction against the use of the self-tender offer defense. Judgment The Delaware Supreme Court reversed the trial court.See id. at 958-59 (holding the directors' decision to oppose the Mesa tender offer had been made in good faith and upon reasonable investigation). It found that the Unocal's board of directors had reasonable grounds for believing that a danger to corporate policy or effectiveness existed and that the response was reasonable in relation to the threat posed. This reasonable relation analysis permitted an analysis of the price, nature, and timing of the offer as well as the impact on shareholders, creditors, customers, employees, and the community. Note that this permission to consider other constituencies besides the shareholders was curtailed in Revlon v. MacAndrews. The Unocal test the court established in this case to determine whether directors may try to prevent a take-over is a two pronged test. The two prongs include: * First, did the directors reasonably perceive a threat? And, * Second, was the directors' defensive measure reasonable in relation to the threat posed? Note that whereas Cheff v. Mathes had sanctioned greenmail, or payment to the raider to go away, in Unocal the court sanctioned reverse greenmail, or payment to shareholders excluding the raider. Analysis The significance of the opinion flows from the court's premise that, due to the inherent conflict of interest involved, takeover defenses pose a significant danger to shareholders.See id. at 954-55 (explaining the need for judicial examination of an enhanced duty before a board may enjoy the protections of the business judgment rule \\"because of the omnipresent specter that a board may be acting primarily in its own interests\\"). In essence, the Unocal court feared that a board may use takeover defenses to impermissibly prevent threats to corporate policy or to the board's control over the corporation.See id. at 955 (\\"\\"We must bear in mind the inherent danger in the purchase of shares with corporate funds to remove a threat to corporate policy when a threat to control is involved.'\\" (quoting Bennett v. Propp, 187 A.2d 405, 409 (Del. 1962))). As a result, there was a need for \\"an enhanced duty\\" on the board, so as to ensure that their decisions in this area were meant only to further the welfare of the corporation and its shareholders.Id. at 954. Therefore, the court ruled that in order for the board to be allotted the protection of the business judgment rule, the board must demonstrate that it was responding to a legitimate threat to corporate policy and effectiveness, and that its actions were \\"reasonable in relation to the threat posed.\\"Id. at 955.

While involved in World War II, he studied malnutrition, and later was involved in food research important for space exploration. Early life A native of Lawrence, Massachusetts, Goldblith was the son of a Russian immigrant. He received his S.B. in biology from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1940. During his student days, he was also involved in Reserve Officers' Training Corps, and began serving with the United States Army Corps of Engineers as a Second Lieutenant in the Philippines. World War II and POW While at the Philippines, Goldblith would be part of the US Army contingent involved in the Battle of the Philippines and captured by the Japanese following the Battle of Corregidor. Having been surrendered on Corregidor, Goldblith avoided the Bataan Death March and Camp O'Donnell, being sent instead to one of the Cabanatuan POW camps. In November 1942 he endured a trip aboard the \\"hell ship\\", Nagato Maru, to Japan. Despite being a POW, Goldblith was able to conduct scientific research, even studying malnutrition and related diseases affecting those around him. His knowledge of botany and chemistry would save the lives of many of his fellow soldiers while a POW. These studies included beriberi, hypoproteinemia, and Vitamin A deficiencies. Goldblith was able to use iodine from his medical kit to dose the foul water in his canteen in an effort to prevent dysentery. His research would be published in the journal Science in September 1946 and in the Office of Naval Research Reports in 1947. Goldblith would earn two Bronze Stars and one Silver Star for his service and be discharged as a Captain in 1946. In later years, Goldblith and his wife, the former Diana Greenberg, would remain in close contact with the Belgian Catholic nuns in the Philippines who were instrumental in saving the lives of so many lives with their food and medical supplies during the war. Return to MIT Upon his discharge from the US Army, Goldblith would return to MIT where he would earn his S.M. in 1947 and his Ph.D. in 1949, both in food technology. He would join the food technology faculty at MIT in 1949, rising to the rank of professor in 1959. Goldblith would serve as acting department chair following Bernard E. Proctor's death in 1959 and remained in that position until Nevin Scrimshaw took over as department chair in 1961. Goldblith would remain as professor until 1974 when he became MIT's director of the Industrial Liaison Program (ILP), a position he would hold until 1978. After that, Goldblith would be promoted to MIT's vice president of resource development until 1986, then promoted again to Senior advisor to the President of MIT, where he would retire in 1992. Research at MIT During his service at MIT, Goldblith led the development of food irradiation, of freeze-drying and microwave technology, all of which would prove important for the Space Race. This included Project Mercury, Project Gemini, and Project Apollo, but would later stretch to Skylab, the Space Shuttle, and even to the International Space Station. The first graduate student that Goldblith worked with was Yiachi Aikawa from Japan. Goldblith's work with Aikawa would both develop a lifelong friendship and allow Goldblith to heal from the emotional wounds he suffered as a POW from World War II. Aikawa would later create TechnoVenture Co., Ltd., the first venture capital firm in Japan. He was also the son of Yoshisuke Aikawa, the founder of Nissan Motors. Their relationship would lead to the opening of the MIT Japan office in 1976 as well. It would also earn Goldblith the Second Grade of the Order of the Sacred Treasure in 1984 for his efforts in strengthening Japanese-American relationships, only the second non-Japanese to do so at that time. Goldblith authored over 250 articles in scientific journals and edited or co-edited six books in food science and technology. He would also author three additional books on the history of MIT, including his 1996 autobiography Appetite for Life.

Personal life Golblith married Diana Greenberg in 1941 and they would remain married until her death in 1990. They would produce two sons (Errol (died 1963) and Jonathan), one daughter (Judith), and two granddaughters (Sarah and Rachel). Death and legacy Goldblith died on December 28, 2001 in Peabody, Massachusetts. A memorial service was held at MIT on May 28, 2002 to honor Goldblith. MIT established the Samuel A.

British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines or BCPA, was an airline registered in New South Wales, Australia in June 1946 with headquarters in Sydney. It was formed by the governments of Australia (50%), New Zealand (30%) and the United Kingdom (20%) to pursue trans-Pacific flights. BCPA was later taken over by Qantas. History BCPA was formed by treaty through an \\"Agreement between the Governments of Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom for the Formation of British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines Limited\\" with an initial capital of £10,000 Australian. The initial agreement was signed on 4 August 1947,http://www3.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1947/5.html with ownership restrictions between the governments removed on 27 October 1949.http://www3.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1949/12.html The original BCPA route was Sydney – Auckland – Fiji – Canton Island – Hawaii – San Francisco – Vancouver and later included Melbourne. Initially, BCPA chartered all flights to Australian National Airways, which used its Douglas DC-4s. The inaugural flight departed from Sydney on 15 September 1946. In late 1948, BCPA took delivery of the first of four Douglas DC-6 aircraft, outfitted as Pullman-type sleepers, bundling board options with small port holes bedside. Each aircraft was named for one of the four sailing vessels of Captain Cook, Resolution, Discovery, Adventure and Endeavour. The airline had ordered six de Havilland Comet jet airliners in 1952 for delivery in 1954. In 1953 it had agreed to buy three Comet IIs for delivery at the end of 1956 and retain two of the DC-6s for tourist-class carriage. In October 1953 discussions were held by the three governments to allow the airline to be taken over by Qantas Empire Airways. In 1954 it was announced that Qantas Empire Airways would take over the BCPA services between Australia and North America and would take over the order for three Comets. Flight 304 crash A Douglas DC-6 operating BCPA Flight 304 crashed on approach to San Francisco International Airport on 29 October 1953. Among the passengers killed in the crash was American concert pianist William Kapell whose estate sued BCPA, BOAC (which was alleged to have sold Kapell the ticket), and Qantas, which had taken over BCPA. In 1964 Kapell's widow and two children were awarded US$924,396 damages. This was later retracted and the Kapell family received only the standard $7,000 internationally agreed award.

On April 16, 2004, he was kidnapped from an Abidjan parking lot and has not been seen since. In early 2012 remains suspected to belong to Kieffer were found in the department of Issia, in the west of Côte d'Ivoire.  Career  Kieffer was born and raised in France; his family lives in the region of Rhône-Alpes. He studied law in Montreal, and while there married a Canadian woman and obtained Canadian nationality; this marriage produced a son Sébastien-Cédric but later resulted in divorce. Kieffer was married to Osange Silou-Kieffer; they have a daughter Canelle. From 1984 to 2002, Kieffer worked for the French financial newspaper La Tribune. Following this he worked in West Africa for a number of years, and wrote articles concerning Political corruption in African governments for several different publications. Among these publications were his former newspaper La Tribune and also La Lettre du Continent as well as several Ivorian newspapers.  Kidnapping and probable murder  At approximately 1 p.m. on April 16, 2004, Kieffer was kidnapped in the parking lot of a shopping center in Abidjan. At the time he was working on a story about money laundering and illegal currency transfers allegedly involving the Ivorian government. He had been drawn there by someone claiming to have leads on a government corruption story he was assembling. He has never been seen since, nor has a corpse been found. To this day his fate and the identity of his kidnappers remains a mystery. In a 2006 interview regarding her book Bitter Chocolate, CBC journalist Carol Off claimed that Kieffer's disappearance and probable murder was related to his investigation of the shady practices involving the Ivorian government and the cocoa industry. She had travelled to Côte d'Ivoire to research her book, and claimed that upon her arrival in the country Canadian embassy officials had given her a stern warning regarding Kieffer: : SU: \\"Did you ever find yourself in danger like he [Kieffer] did?\\" : Off: \\"I had a meeting with the Canadian Embassy and they said \\"you shouldn't be here asking questions about cocoa. It's very dangerous. But if you have to, at the very least, don't ask any questions about Guy-André Kieffer. Whatever you do, don't even mention his name.\\" : \\"Maybe that's good advice, but wherever I went they would raise his name and in ways that I realized weren't even veiled threats. I would be speaking with somebody in the business and they would say, 'You know what happened to the last person who asked these questions? I wonder where he is now?' They would just look at you. You got the message. I quickly realized how incredibly sinister and evil this story really was.\\"  Legal proceedings  In May 2004, civil proceedings concerning Kieffer's disappearance were launched in France by Kieffer's family and Reporters sans frontières. The French magistrate charged with the case was sent to Abidjan and there interrogated Michel Legré, a brother-in-law of the wife of Ivorian president Laurent Gbagbo, who was allegedly the last person to see Kieffer alive. Legré provided a list of names of influential Ivorians who he alleged were involved in Kieffer's kidnapping. This list of names was subsequently published in some Ivorian newspapers. In 2004, Legré was arrested in Abidjan by Ivorian police and charged with complicity in a kidnapping, illegal imprisonment and murder. He was also charged with defamation for naming the individuals on the list. Legré was provisionally released in 2005 and has since fled the country - or is in an unknown location.Où est Michel Legré ? 16 septembre 2007, Jeune Afrique. Subsequently, the French magistrate was not granted access to all of the persons named by Legré. The magistrate questioned Legré himself on 21 October 2004, and on 13 December 2004 requested that Legré be temporarily moved to France, as he felt Legré was unable to speak freely in his Ivorian prison. However, the French government initially did not aid in this request, for which they were denounced by Kieffer's wife Osange Silou-Kieffer. On August 23, 2007, French president Nicolas Sarkozy met with Kieffer's wife Osange Silou-Kieffer in Paris, and expressed his determination to aid in the case. Silou-Kieffer claimed that Sarkozy's predecessor Jacques Chirac had never answered her request for a meeting. Silou-Kieffer indicated she had asked Sarkozy to pressure Ivorian president Laurent Gbagbo to allow French judges to interrogate Ivorian suspects in the case. In July 2008 Simone Gbagbo - First Lady of Côte d'Ivoire - was formally called for questioning by a French investigative judge, examining the April 2004 disappearance and presumed death of Kieffer.Affaire Kieffer: Simone Gbagbo et un ministre convoqués chez le juge. 8 July 2008 - AFP.

It was a conversion of existing Type 95 Ha-Go light tanks, re-fitted with the larger turret of the Type 97 Chi-Ha medium tank. History and development The Type 4 Ke-Nu was a variant of the Type 95 Ha-Go light tank. The original Type 97 Chi-Ha medium tank was armed with a low muzzle velocity 57 mm tank gun. Operational experience against the Soviet Red Army at Nomonhan during the Soviet–Japanese border conflicts in 1939 revealed that this gun was inadequate against opposing armor, and a new higher velocity 47 mm tank gun was developed. This was installed in the Type 97 Chi-Ha with a larger turret to produce the Type 97-kai Shinhoto version.History of War: Type 4 Ke-Nu Light Tank This left a large number of surplus Type 97 Chi-Ha turrets, which were later retrofitted onto the hulls of the obsolete Type 95 Ha-Go light tank. The result was designated the Type 4 Ke-Nu. The retrofitting did decrease the problem of cramped turret place for the crew, which had been encountered in an earlier attempt to up-gun Type 95 tanks with a 57 mm tank gun in a modified turret of a prototype known as the Type 3 Ke-Ri light tank.History of War: Type 3 Ke-Ri As for the Type 4 Ke-Nu, approximately 100 units were converted in 1944. Design Essentially a Type 95 light tank with a Type 97 medium tank gun turret, the Type 4 Ke-Nu had slightly better firepower, but the retrofitting increased the weight of the tank to 8.4 tons. This reduced the top speed of the tank to 40 km/h. Given the replacement turret had thicker armor, it did provide the crew with some additional protection in that area, but did nothing to alleviate the Type 95's greatest weakness of the lack of suitable armor protection for the hull. Maximum armor protection for the tank (25 mm) was provided by the Type 97 turret, but it was defeated by the 37 mm, 75 mm and 2-pounders mounted on Allied tanks. Combat record Type 4 Ke-Nu at Kubinka Museum, Moscow The conversion coming in 1944 was too late to make any impact on Japanese combat operations, and most of the Type 4 Ke-Nu were retained in the Japanese home islands in anticipation of the projected American invasion. Some were assigned to units in Korea and Manchukuo, and saw brief combat against Soviet forces in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria. A surviving Type 4 Ke-Nu captured in Manchukuo is on display in Moscow at the Kubinka Tank Museum.

His fiction was heavily influenced by his philosophical ideas, and he has been compared to Franz Kafka in this regard.  History  Born in Copenhagen, Sørensen graduated from the Vestre Borgerdydskole in 1947, and then attended the University of Copenhagen and the University of Freiburg studying philosophy. Although he did not graduate, he later received an honorary degree from the University of Copenhagen. Sørensen published his first collection of short stories, Strange Stories in 1953, which many critics have identified as being the start of Danish literary Modernism. He published additional collections of short stories in 1955 and 1964, all winning various awards in Denmark. These stories generally explored the absurd and hidden parts of the human psyche. Sørensen began editing the journal Vindrosen (with Klaus Rifbjerg) in 1959. Afterward, he became a member of the Danish Academy in 1965, subsequently editing several other Modernist journals and periodicals. Sørensen, though he continued to produce short fiction throughout his life, was also deeply engaged in philosophy, about which he wrote many essays and several books including Seneca: The Humanist at the Court of Nero and his response to Søren Kierkegaard's Either/Or, Hverken-eller (i.e. \\"Neither/Nor\\"). He also published books and essays about Nietzsche, Kafka, Marx, Schopenhauer and Kierkegaard, and was a notable translator of over 20 books. He was awarded the Grand Prize of the Danish Academy in 1962, The Nordic Council's Literature Prize in 1974, the Hans Christian Andersen Award in 1983, the inaugural Swedish Academy Nordic Prize in 1986, along with many other awards and recognitions. He died in Copenhagen in 2001.

They are notable for being associated with the new wave of British heavy metal movement. History =1983-1990= The band spent the first time after having formed writing material and rehearsing. After brief stints as \\"Purgatory\\" and \\"Hellfire\\" the members finally decided on naming the band \\"Elixir\\". According to the biography on the band's website the name was chosen through Steve Bentley closing his eyes and putting his finger on a word in a dictionary at random. In need of a vocalist Elixir recruited singer Sally Pike, but after recording a four song demo tape and playing two gigs together, she left the band by the end of the year. In 1984 Pike was replaced by Paul Taylor, and later the same year guitarist Norman Gordon joined the band to fill the vacant spot left by Steve Bentley, who departed after Elixir had completed their second demo tape. In 1985, Elixir released their debut single \\"Treachery (Ride like the Wind)\\" / \\"Winds of Time\\". This single was reviewed by Ronnie James Dio in Kerrang! (No 99), and was given the thumbs up. In 1986, the band recorded their first album The Son of Odin. In issue 137 (November 2005) of Terrorizer magazine, the album was included in the top 20 power metal albums of all time, alongside Judas Priest's Painkiller, Helloween's Keeper of the Seven Keys Part II and Cirith Ungol's King of the Dead. Elixir recorded their second album, initially called Sovereign Remedy in 1988 with Mark White on the bass and former Iron Maiden drummer Clive Burr. Stevie Hughes replaced Burr for the band's live commitments through 1989. At the end of the year, Phil Denton quit the band and was replaced by Leon Lawson for several live shows before the band came off the road. Their second album was released by the Sonic label as Lethal Potion in 1990. In 2004, the album was re-released as Sovereign Remedy on the TPL label, as it was originally intended, with all the tracks, the original mix and new artwork. =2001-2012= In 2001 the band reverted to the Paul Taylor, Phil Denton, Norman Gordon, Kevin Dobbs and Nigel Dobbs line up and in 2003 recorded their third album The Idol, which was made up of material the band had written in the 1980s. With rising popularity, the band toured around various countries such as Greece, Germany and the United States. Elixir recorded their fourth album Mindcreeper in 2006, which was released by Majestic Rock. Elixir released their latest album All Hallows Eve on 31 October 2010 on their own CTR label. Between 2006 and 2012, Elixir organised six editions of the \\"British Steel Festival\\", appearing on the bill at each event. From 2008 onwards, the festival was held at the Camden Underworld.British Steel VI Festival details at Planetmosh website, 31 March 2012 Elixir disbanded in 2012, with members Paul Taylor and Phil Denton going on to form the metal/rock band Midnight Messiah.

Early life Memorial Plaque at Čáslav Stich was born in Žehušice in Bohemia. His father was a serf bonded to the estate of Count Joseph Johann von Thun, but Stich was taught singing, violin and finally the horn. The Count sent him to study horn under Joseph Matiegka in Prague, Jan Schindelarz in Munich, and finally with A. J. Hampel in Dresden (from 1763 to 1764). Hampel first taught Stich the hand-stopping technique which he later improved and extended. Stich then returned to the service of the Count, where he remained for the next four years. At the age of 20 Stich and four friends ran away from the estate. The Count, who had invested heavily in Stich's education, dispatched soldiers with orders to knock out Stich's front teeth to prevent him ever playing the horn again, but they failed to capture the group, and Stich crossed into Italy, into the Holy Roman Empire. Punto around Europe On arriving in Italy, Stich changed his name to Giovanni Punto (an approximate Italianisation of his name) and went to work in the orchestra of Josef Friedrich Wilhelm, Prince of Hohenzollern-Hechingen. From there he moved to Mainz, to the court orchestra, but left after a few years when they did not give him the post of Konzertmeister. After this he began to travel and play as a soloist, touring much of Europe including England. Charles Burney heard him play in Koblenz in 1772, describing Punto as \\"the celebrated French horn from Bohemia, whose taste and astonishing execution were lately so applauded in London\\". Punto was particularly active in Paris, playing there 49 times between 1776 and 1788, but his use of hand-stopping was criticized by some in London, possibly due to the novelty of the technique. In 1777, he was invited to teach the horn players in the private orchestra of George III. Punto also composed pieces to demonstrate his own virtuosity (a common practice then), which indicate that he was a master of quick arpeggios and stepwise passagework. In 1778 Punto met Mozart in Paris, after which Mozart reported to his father Leopold that \\"Punto plays magnifique.\\" Punto was to play the horn part in Mozart's Sinfonia Concertante for Four Winds K297b but at the last minute this was dropped from the programme and subsequently lost. The same year Punto probably entered into an arrangements with some Parisian publishers; nearly all his subsequent compositions were published in Paris, whereas they were previously listed in Breitkopf's catalogue. A new horn was also made for him in 1778, a silver cor solo, which he used for the rest of his life. Punto sought a permanent position in which he could conduct as well as compose and play, and in 1781 he entered the service of Franz Ludwig von Erthal, the Prince-bishop of Würzburg, later moving to become the Konzertmeister (with a pension) for the Comte d’Artois (later to become Charles X of France) in Paris. He was successful enough in this role that in 1787 he was able to secure leave of absence and tour the Rhineland in his own coach, a mark of considerable wealth at the time. On returning to Paris in 1789 Punto was appointed conductor of the Théâtre des Variétés Amusantes, where he remained for ten years, leaving in 1799 when he was not appointed to the staff of the newly founded Paris Conservatoire. Moving on to Vienna via Munich, Punto met Ludwig van Beethoven, who wrote his Op. 17 Sonata for Horn and Piano for the two of them. They premiered the work on 18 April 1800 at the Burgtheater and played the work again the following month in Pest, Hungary. Return home In 1801, Punto returned to his homeland after 33 years, playing a grand concert on 18 May in the National Theatre in Prague. A reviewer commented that Punto \\"received enthusiastic applause for his concertos because of his unparalleled mastery, and respected musicians said that they had never before heard horn playing like it\\". The reviewer commented on his innovative techniques, noting that \\"in his cadenzas he produced many novel effects, playing two and even three-part chords\\", and added that Punto was evidence that Bohemia was able to produce \\"great artistic and musical geniuses\\". In 1802, after a short trip to Paris, Punto developed pleurisy, a common illness among wind players. He died five months later on 16 February 1803, being accorded a \\"magnificent\\" funeral in the Church of St. Nicholas attended by thousands. Mozart's Requiem was performed at the graveside.  Legacy  Franz Joseph Fröhlich wrote that \\"what distinguished Punto, in a way that one has never heard in any other artist heretofore, was his most magnificent performance, the gentlest portrayals, the thunder of tones and their sweetest indescribable blending of nuances with the most varied tone production, an agile tongue, dexterous in all forms of articulation, single and double tones, and even chords, but most important, a silver-bright and charming cantabile tone.\\" Among his surviving compositions are: * 16 horn concerti (nos. 9, 12, 13, 15 and 16 lost) * a concerto for two horns and 103 horn duos * 47 horn trios * 21 horn quartets * a horn sextet * a concerto for clarinet * a book of daily exercises for horn Sources * Sadie, Stanley (Ed.), The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 2nd edition.

The Conservatoire is a member of the World Conservation Union. \\"Lido de Thau\\" in Sète, Hérault. Its creation was inspired by the work of the British National Trust, though the National Trust is a private charity, whereas the Conservatoire du littoral is mainly government funded. Its remit covers all French départements, départements d'outre-mer, Mayotte, and, recently, Saint-Pierre and Miquelon. The Conservatoire acquires land by private agreement, by pre-emption in or, from time to time, by expropriation. Land may also be given to the Conservatoire by donation or legacy. The Conservatoire acquires 20 to 30 km2 of land yearly. After ensuring all the restoration work, the Conservatoire entrusts the management of its lands to local authorities or other local groups or organisations. The Conservatoire uses specialists to decide how the sites should be managed and what activities (such as agricultural or recreational activities) can take place. As at 31 January 2005, the Conservatoire cared for an area of 732 km2 spread over 300 sites, for 861 km of shoreline and 700 sites in 2015 for 1500 km, or 13 percent of French seacoast (the objective is to reach one third in 2050). Its annual budget is approximately €30 million, €25 M of which is earmarked for acquisitions and development. Most of its budget is provided by the national government, but local authorities and the European Union also contribute, as do corporations and private donors. The Conservatoire national du littoral employs 100 people in Rochefort, in Paris, and in its regional offices.

The guard can be seen at the back. John Frederick Herring In Great Britain, Ireland, and Australia, a mail coach was a stagecoach built to a General Post Office-approved design operated by an independent contractor to carry long-distance mail for the Post Office. Mail was held in a box at the rear where the only Royal Mail employee, an armed guard, stood. Passengers were taken at a premium fare. There was seating for four passengers inside and more outside with the driver. The guard's seat could not be shared. This distribution system began in Britain in 1784. In Ireland the same service began in 1789, and in Australia it began in 1828. A mail coach service ran to an exact and demanding schedule. Aside from quick changes of horses the coach only stopped for collection and delivery of mail and never for the comfort of the passengers. To avoid a steep fine turnpike gates had to be open by the time the mail coach with its right of free passage passed through. The gatekeeper was warned by the sound of the posthorn. Mail coaches were slowly phased out during the 1840s and 1850s, their role eventually replaced by trains as the railway network expanded. North Country MailsEngland north of the river Humber at The Peacock, Islington 1821. James Pollard History in Britain The postal delivery service in Britain had existed in the same form for about 150 years - from its introduction in 1635, mounted carriers had ridden between \\"posts\\" where the postmaster would remove the letters for the local area before handing the remaining letters and any additions to the next rider. The riders were frequent targets for robbers, and the system was inefficient. John Palmer, a theatre owner from Bath, believed that the coach service he had previously run for transporting actors and materials between theatres could be utilised for a countrywide mail delivery service, so in 1782, he suggested to the Post Office in London that they take up the idea. He met resistance from officials who believed that the existing system could not be improved, but eventually the Chancellor of the Exchequer, William Pitt, allowed him to carry out an experimental run between Bristol and London. Under the old system the journey had taken up to 38 hours. The coach, funded by Palmer, left Bristol at 4pm on 2 August 1784 and arrived in London just 16 hours later. Impressed by the trial run, Pitt authorised the creation of new routes. By the end of 1785 there were services from London to Norwich, Liverpool, Leeds, Dover, Portsmouth, Poole, Exeter, Gloucester, Worcester, Holyhead and Carlisle. A service to Edinburgh was added the next year and Palmer was rewarded by being made Surveyor and Comptroller General of the Post Office. Initially the coach, horses and driver were all supplied by contractors. There was strong competition for the contracts as they provided a fixed regular income on top of which the companies could charge fares for the passengers. By the beginning of the 19th century the Post Office had their own fleet of coaches with black and maroon livery. The early coaches were poorly built, but in 1787 the Post Office adopted John Besant's improved and patented design, after which Besant, with his partner John Vidler, enjoyed a monopoly on the supply of coaches, and a virtual monopoly on their upkeep and servicing. The mail coaches continued unchallenged until the 1830s but the development of railways spelt the end for the service. The first rail delivery between Liverpool and Manchester took place on 11 November 1830. By the early 1840s other rail lines had been constructed and many London-based mail coaches were starting to be withdrawn from service; the final service from London (to Norwich) was shut down in 1846. Regional mail coaches continued into the 1850s, but these too were eventually replaced by rail services. =Travel= Royal Mail coach preserved in the Science Museum, London The mail coaches were originally designed for a driver, seated outside, and up to four passengers inside. The guard (the only Post Office employee on the coach) travelled on the outside at the rear next to the mail box. Later a further passenger was allowed outside, sitting at the front next to the driver, and eventually a second row of seating was added behind him to allow two further passengers to sit outside. Travel could be uncomfortable as the coaches travelled on poor roads and passengers were obliged to dismount from the carriage when going up steep hills to spare the horses (as Charles Dickens describes at the beginning of A Tale of Two Cities). The coaches averaged 7 to 8 mph (11-13 km/h) in summer and about 5 mph (8 km/h) in winter but by the time of Queen Victoria the roads had improved enough to allow speeds of up to 10 mph (16 km/h). Fresh horses were supplied every 10 to 15 miles (16-24 km). Stops to collect mail were short and sometimes there would be no stops at all with the guard throwing the mail off the coach and snatching the new deliveries from the postmaster. The cost of travelling by mail coach was about 1d. a mile more expensive than by private stage coach, but the coach was faster and, in general, less crowded and cleaner. Crowding was a common problem with private stage coaches, which led to them overturning; the limits on numbers of passengers and luggage prevented this occurring on the mail coaches. Travel on the mail coach was nearly always at night; as the roads were less busy the coach could make better speed. The guard was heavily armed with a blunderbuss and two pistols and dressed in the Post Office livery of maroon and gold. The mail coaches were thus well defended against highwaymen, and accounts of robberies often confuse them with private stage coaches, though robberies did occur. To prevent corruption and ensure good performance, the guards were paid handsomely and supplied with a generous pension. The mail was their sole charge, meaning that they had to deliver it on foot if a problem arose with the coach and, unlike the driver, they remained with the coach for the whole journey; occasionally guards froze to death from hypothermia in their exposed position outside the coach during the harsh winters (see River Thames frost fairs). The guard was supplied with a timepiece and a posthorn, the former to ensure the schedule was met, the latter to alert the post house to the imminent arrival of the coach and warn tollgate keepers to open the gate (mail coaches were exempt from stopping and paying tolls: a fine was payable if the coach was forced to stop). Since the coaches had right of way on the roads the horn was also used to advise other road users of their approach. History in Ireland A twice-weekly stage coach service operated between Dublin and Drogheda to the north, Kilkenny to the south and Athlone to the west as early as 1737 and for a short period from 1740, a Dublin to Belfast stage coach existed. In winter, this last route took three days, with overnight stops at Drogheda and Newry; in summer, travel time was reduced to two days. In 1789, mail coaches began a scheduled service from Dublin to Belfast. They met the mail boats coming from Portpatrick in Scotland at Donaghadee, in County Down. By the mid-19th century, most of the mail coaches in Ireland were eventually out-competed by Charles Bianconi's country-wide network of open carriages, before this system in turn succumbed to the railways. History in Australia A preserved Cobb & Co Australian Royal Mail Coach with Concord mud-coach undercarriage Australia's first mail coach was established in 1828 and was crucial in connecting the remote settlements being established to the larger centres. The first mail contracts were issued and mail was transported by coach or on horseback from Sydney to the first seven country post offices – Penrith, Parramatta, Liverpool, Windsor, Campbelltown, Newcastle and Bathurst. The Sydney to Melbourne overland packhorse mail service was commenced in 1837. From 1855 the Sydney to Melbourne overland mail coach was supplanted by coastal steamer ship and rail. The rail network became the distributor of mail to larger regional centres there the mail coach met the trains and carried the mail to more remote towns and villages. In 1863 contracts were awarded to the coaching company Cobb & Co to transport Royal Mail services within New South Wales and Victoria. These contracts and later others in Queensland continued until 1924 when the last service operated in western Queensland. The lucrative mail contracts helped Cobb & Co grow and become an efficient and vast network of coach services in eastern Australia. Imported Concord stagecoach 1853, Castlemaine, Victoria, Australia Royal Mail coach services reached their peak in the later decades of the 19th century, operating over thousands of miles of eastern Australia. In 1870s Cobb & Co's Royal Mail coaches were operating some 6000 horses per day, and traveling 28,000 miles weekly carrying mail, gold, and general parcels. Some Concord stagecoaches were imported from the United States made in New Hampshire by the Abbot-Downing Company. This design was a 'thorough-brace' or 'jack' style coach characterized by an elegant curved lightweight body suspended on two large leather straps, which helped to isolate the passengers and driver from the jolts and bumps of the rough unmade country roads. Soon Australian coach builders using many of the Concord design features customized the design for Australian conditions.

It was followed by The Drama Handbook: A Guide to Reading Plays (co-written with Mary Luckhurst, Professor of Modern Drama at the University of York), trying to bridge the gap between text-based literary and more performative teaching. Lennard's more recent involvement with work on genre fiction, particularly Crime Writing, Science fiction, and Children's literature, reflects a long history of 'unliterary' reading and interest in literature as a means of living as well as a subject of aesthetic and historical study. He has variously protested the application of class snobbery to literature, and But I Digress features parentheses by Elvis Costello and Robert B. Parker as well as chapters on Marvell, Coleridge, and T. S. Eliot. Both Handbooks were similarly eclectic in choosing examples, and his annotated edition of the award-winning Jamaican verse-novel View from Mount Diablo by Ralph Thompson considers both the crime novel and the Bildungsroman as models.

Leff answers this question in the negative and follows the consequences to their logical conclusions. He graduated from Amherst College and Harvard Law School and would also teach at the Washington University School of Law.https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/04/obituaries/arthur- a-leff-is-dead-at-46-professor-at-yale-law-school.html Leff's first major work Economic Analysis of the Law: Some Realism About Nominalism is putatively a book review of Richard Posner's Economic Analysis of the Law. In actuality it is a critique of the use of any single methodology to provide normative rules for law and morality. The article is still, today, the main critique of Posner's work and economic analysis generally and is usually read in graduate seminars on Economic Analysis (though sometimes misidentified as the Legal Realist critique). Leff makes two fundamental propositions in Some Realism About Nominalism: (1) that all models are only very limited views of the real world. When Posner views the world through the economic model much more is hidden than is revealed; (2) there is no system of logic for preferring one model (e.g. economic, social, political) over another unless an axiom is inserted early on into that system of logic. Leff notes that the opening of Posner's work does just that—inserts a proposition that rational economic behavior is to be preferred to other behavior. Leff follows his insight to its logical conclusion and notes that similarly there is no way, using logic, to prove that any particular act, no matter how horrible, is normatively wrong. Put it another way, one can never prove to another person that a particular set of behaviors is right or that a different set of behaviors is wrong. He states: :I will put the current situation as sharply as possible: there is today no way of ‘proving’ that napalming babies is bad except by asserting it (in a louder and louder voice), or by defining it as so, early in one’s game, and then later slipping it through, in a whisper, as a conclusion. Leff continues his critique of attempts to find normative rules in law and morality in Law and Technology: On shoring up a Void, Unspeakable Ethics, Unnatural Law (alluding to the title of a collection of stories by Donald Barthelme), and his review of Robert Unger's Knowledge and Politics in the form of a letter from The Devil. In these works, Leff attempts to directly address whether a normative morality can exist without God. Leff answers the question in the negative. Leff states that absent an ultimate authority figure (i.e. God) handing down moral laws from on-high there is no reason for any person to prefer one set of behavior identified as \\"moral\\" to another. Leff terms this \\"the Grand Sez Who.\\" In particular, it is impossible to resolve the conflict between the rights of the individual and the power of the collective, even though much of the time we can pretend that, for instance, the Constitution tells us where to draw the line. There are bound to be cases where we are left on our own, with no authoritative referee; there is no \\"brooding omnipresence in the sky\\", in the words of Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., whom Leff quotes approvingly. In Unspeakable Ethics, Unnatural Law Leff also criticizes the views of Robert Nozick and Roberto Unger, noting that for all their differences they end up with remarkably similar solutions to the problem of resolving differences among morally sovereign individuals: agglomerations of the like-minded, geographically separated. Leff claims that this move merely shifts the problem. Against Nozick, Leff states that his entire book, Anarchy, State, and Utopia, is built on the naked assertion that \\"individuals have rights\\", and that an entirely different yet equally valid argument could be built on the premise \\"individuals have duties\\". The arbitrary choice of starting point decides everything. Leff states as follows in the closing of Unspeakable Ethics, Unnatural Law: :All I can say is this: it looks as if we are all we have. Given what we know about ourselves, and each other, this is an extraordinarily unappetizing prospect; looking around the world, it appears that if all men are brothers, the ruling model is Cain and Abel. Neither reason, nor love, nor even terror, seems to have worked to make us “good,” and worse than that, there is no reason why any thing should. Only if ethics were something unspeakable by us could law be unnatural, and therefore unchallengeable. As things stand now, everything is up for grabs. Nevertheless: :Napalming babies is bad. :Starving the poor is wicked. :Buying and selling each other is depraved. :Those who stood up and died resisting Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Idi Amin, and Pol Pot —and General Custer too— have earned salvation. :Those who acquiesced deserve to be damned. :There is in the world such a thing as evil. :[All together now:] Sez who? :God help us. In Swindling and Selling, Leff presented a wry analysis of the blurry lines between what we consider honest salesmanship and illegal fraud. Not all selling is swindling, but all swindling is selling, Leff explains. He shows how both sellers and swindlers have to overcome similar forms of buyer resistance. Leff explains these dynamics in the language of Erving Goffman and through some use of behavioral economics. In the case of swindling, con artists weave a dramaturgy where they hold a monopoly over some valuable asset, and the mark is set up as monopsonist, an exclusive buyer with access to a special deal. The scheme is premised on mutual need, and policing of these schemes is difficult because for part of the transaction, the mark is a willing participant. Here, Leff describes scams such as the “Spanish Prisoner,” where a mark is promised great riches if he will only bribe some minor official to free the holder of the treasure (the modern version of this includes the “419” scheme). Leff then pans out to show how the elements of swindling are present in some political and religious movements (although these may not be scams). The “ancient estate” scam, where marks are convinced that a fantastic old property was improperly distributed, making many modern- day people claimants to it, is similar to political movements to repatriate lands. “Godcons” are con games where the “conman…induces one or more marks to trade money…of this world value in exchange for the promised delivery of quantities of exceedingly valuable divinely manufactured goods.” Pyramid schemes operate by distracting marks from the opportunity costs of their labor, and by getting them emotionally attached to a swindle instead of more viable employment. Leff then switches from “bunco” to legal selling. In a perfect market, bargains should not exist. Thus, sellers must create a plausible dramaturgy to explain why a buyer gets a bargain. This could be a clearance sale, with praises the buyer as parsimonious while implying that less careful consumers are getting the anti-bargain. Leff then turns to mass advertising, which relies upon several predicable cons: the “sufficiency switch” and the “Calvinist causation.” The former refers to the many products that suggest some cause and effect between the purchase of a product and some goal—clear up one’s complexion with a skin cream and get the girl. The latter is Leff’s term for positional objects: the Cadillac or the Mercedes. These things operate from an opposite logic. They do not make one successful, they license a script (and a prop) to the mark: “Buy this symbol with which you can advertise, powerfully and convincingly, that you are what you, and those about whose opinions you care, devoutly wish to be.\\" Leff was an agnostic but his writings have been influential on Christian discussions of morality in the modern era. Phillip E. Johnson has suggested that Leff's work is really a critique of the God is dead argument. Johnson argues that the presence of evil in the world is evidence that there is an absolute morality which requires an absolute authority. Other Christian scholars have also applied Leff's critique to secular arguments for a normative morality. Responses to Leff Posner has responded to Leff by stating that the purpose of any methodology or model is to simplify. Otherwise it would be impossible to achieve any kind of understanding of the real world. In Grounding Normative Assertions: Arthur Leff’s Still Irrefutable, but Incomplete, Sez Who Critique, 20 J. L. & Religion 31 (2004-2005), Washington and Lee University Law Professor Sam Calhoun agrees with Leff that attempts to ground secular, universal norms are doomed to fail. Calhoun argues, though, that Leff’s critique of moral norms is incomplete because Leff ignores a God-based morality. If God is introduced, normative assumptions can be securely grounded, although Calhoun acknowledges that looking to God for moral truth has many challenges.

Via the Hocking and Ohio Rivers, it is part of the watershed of the Mississippi River, draining an area of 116 square miles (300 km²) on the unglaciated portion of the Allegheny Plateau. Monday Creek has been badly affected by acid mine drainage. Course and watershed Monday Creek rises north of Shawnee in southern Perry County, and flows generally southwardly through northeastern Hocking County and northwestern Athens County, passing through the eastern part of Nelsonville to its confluence with the Hocking River about 2 miles (3 km) southeast of that city. Its largest tributaries are Little Monday Creek, 14.3 miles (23 km) long, which flows through Perry and Hocking Counties, and the Snow Fork, 10.7 miles (17.2 km) long, which rises in Perry County and flows through Hocking and Athens Counties, through the communities of Murray City and Buchtel. Monday Creek near Nelsonville in 2006 As of 1994, land use in the Monday Creek watershed was occupied this way: *Forest, 87% *Surface mining, 5% *Cropland, 3% *Wetlands, 2% *Grazing and pasture, 1% each *Urban, 1% The Wayne National Forest owns 38% of land in the watershed; the largest private landowner is the Sunday Creek Mining Company. History The Adena, who lived in the region around 1000 BC, were the earliest known inhabitants of the Monday Creek area. Later native people of the region included the Lenape, Shawnee and Wyandot. According to legend, early European explorers of the region named the stream for the day on which it was discovered. The previous day the explorers had similarly named nearby Sunday Creek. The earliest white settlements in the area date to 1774; the Ohio Company purchased all the land in the watershed in two installments in 1787 and 1792. The aggressive pursuit of natural resources, including coal, timber, salt, iron, and clay took its toll on the watershed from the mid-19th century until well into the 20th century. Iron production in the area aided the North during the Civil War. As much as 89% of the Monday Creek watershed was deforested by 1885, with replanting beginning with the establishment of the Wayne National Forest in 1935. Salt mining occurred in the watershed in the 19th century; clay brick production peaked in the early 20th century; oil and natural gas production began in 1909. The earliest coal mines in the watershed can be traced to the 1860s. Early mines were underground, a practice which was in sharp decline by the 1920s and had ended completely in the watershed by 1991. Surface mining was begun post-World War II and declined in the 1970s. Coal in the watershed is primarily of the Middle Kittaning #6 variety, which is high in sulfur and has been identified by the Ohio EPA as having a high potential for pollution. The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency has identified Monday Creek as having been \\"irretrievably altered to the extent that no appreciable aquatic life can be supported\\" due to severe contamination by acid mine drainage. The Monday Creek Restoration Project, sponsored by Rural Action, has been working since 1994 to address water quality issues in the Monday Creek watershed.

Scripted like mini-plays, two-hander episodes have become a tradition in EastEnders over the years, dating back to a groundbreaking episode in 1986, which featured publicans Den Watts and Angie Watts. Devoting an entire half an hour of drama to just two characters had previously been unheard of in a bi- weekly serial before this episode aired, but it set a precedent for the programme and it has featured two-handers ever since. Typically the episodes feature revelations and major character changes to an important relationship, and intense interactions between two prominent characters. Structuring the episode in this way allows for in-depth focus on a specific character/storyline that would be impossible to achieve in the fast-moving and rapidly cut regular episodes. It also relies on just the one story and two actors to hold the audience for the entire duration of the episode. Practically, these episodes were originally created for speedy filming purposes, as while the two actors were filming the two-hander, the remaining cast could be filming another episode.  Two-hander episodes  =Den and Angie Watts (16 October 1986)= The first two-hander features Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) and Angie Watts (Anita Dobson) and is structured like a tennis match, with a non-speaking window cleaner forever strolling innocently into the action. The episode is written by Jane Hollowood and directed by Antonia Bird. This episode was watched by 14.0 million viewers in its original broadcast.\\"Angie - six months to live\\", BBC. URL last accessed on 31 October 2006. Writers chose to give Den and Angie a two-hander episode due to their popularity.From EastEnders to Hollywood: Antonia Bird, BBC Four, 26 May 2016. Den and Angie's marriage has broken down, and before the episode, Den finally decides to end the marriage and leave Angie for his mistress, Jan Hammond (Jane How). The episode begins with Den trying to talk to Angie to tell her that he wants to leave her and get a divorce. Angie stalls but Den persists and explains to her that he wants a clean break from her, their pub, The Queen Victoria, Albert Square and Walford. Den tells Angie that he shall get another pub through a deal with James Wilmott-Brown (William Boyde) and Jan would be doing the books. Angie is shocked and feels defeated, but she then reveals that she is terminally ill with only six months to live. Den does not believe her, but Angie explains her story to Den; Angie's hysterical performance eventually convinces him. Den crumbles and promises to stay with her, adding that he will kill Angie if she is lying. Consumed by guilt, Den asks Angie for her forgiveness. As Den leaves Angie alone and takes their dog Roly for a walk, she gives a deranged smile, revealing that she has been lying to Den. =Dot Cotton and Ethel Skinner (2 July 1987)= The second two-hander features old friends Dot Cotton (June Brown) and Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin), who are babysitting Vicki Fowler (Emma Herry) one rainy afternoon. This episode centres around nostalgia and growing old and was scripted to show the sadness behind the often comical characters of Dot and Ethel. The episode was written by Charlie Humphreys and directed by Mike Gibbon, a future producer of the show. While baby Vicki sleeps, Dot and Ethel reminisce about their lives during World War II and share secrets from their girlhoods. During the war Ethel was 17 and remained in London where she witnessed the death of her family, who were killed by a German doodlebug. Dot was evacuated to Wales when she was three years old and stayed with a couple she called Auntie Gwen and Uncle Will, who wanted to adopt her. Dot later confessed that she had an abortion soon after she married Charlie Cotton (Christopher Hancock) because he told her he would leave her if she kept the baby. This caused a furious Dr. Harold Legg (Leonard Fenton) to punch Charlie on the nose in The Queen Victoria public house. Towards the end of the episode Dot goes out to the shop for a loaf bread and some fig rolls. When she returns Ethel is asleep and Dot thinks she has died and begins weeping and reciting the Lord's Prayer. When Ethel rouses, Dot panics and Ethel has to slap her out of it. Ethel then tearfully reminisces about her dead husband William and the past. As the episode ends, Dot and Ethel tend to Vicki while singing. =Sharon Watts and Michelle Fowler (4 April 1989)= The third two-hander featured the best friends Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean) and Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully). In the aftermath of Sharon's adoptive father, Den Watts' (Leslie Grantham) death, the two friends started an evening at home with a bottle of wine and their memories. This episode was written by Tony McHale and directed by Mike Gibbon. After Den's supposed murder, Sharon - his adoptive daughter - began to speculate about the identity of the mysterious woman who had been seen with him prior to his death. When Sharon told Michelle that she felt that she and her daughter Vicki Fowler (Samantha Leigh Martin) were now her family, Michelle blurted out a secret that she'd been keeping for over three years - that Den was Vicki's father and she was the mystery woman who was seen with Den before his death. Michelle thought Sharon would be comforted to know that she was, in a sense, Vicki's sister, and that a part of Den lived on in Vicki. However, Sharon took the news very badly, feeling hurt, angry and deceived. After slapping Michelle and having an emotional showdown, Sharon left their flat wishing that Michelle had never told her. =Grant and Phil Mitchell (15 November 1994)= This episode featured the Mitchell brothers, Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) and Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp). Following Grant's discovery that Phil had slept with his wife, Sharon Mitchell (Letitia Dean), Grant had beaten Phil so badly that he was hospitalised with a dangerous blood clot to the brain. Phil was rushed into surgery, and the clot was removed. As Grant sat with his brother, the two made a pact and promised that they would never let a woman come between them again. As Phil awoke from his surgery he found his brother sleeping next to him, holding his hand. Grant awoke and instantly got defensive claiming that he was only there because their friend Nigel Bates (Paul Bradley) had persuaded him. As the two started talking Grant started to reminisce about the past when a girl he was dating came onto Phil and he told him. He asked him if that's what it was like with Sharon. Did she come onto him? And why didn't he tell him? Phil told him it wasn't like that, but Grant kept on calling Sharon a slut and blaming her for the whole affair. He was angry with himself for marrying a slapper. Phil tried to tell him that Sharon was not a slut, but his protests fell on deaf ears. Grant proceeded to ask Phil how easy Sharon was to pull. He wouldn't answer, but Grant persisted saying that he never used to be so bashful. After continual pestering Phil began to get agitated and told Grant that Sharon was easy and he didn't even have to get out of first gear. They then began to talk about their relationship, how people used to hate them because they were so close and could do anything together and this was always Sharon's problem. After they reminisced about their many conquests with women Grant returned to the topic of Sharon. He was planning to crush her \\"like a table tennis ball\\" and make her pay for what she'd done. Phil warned him not to do anything stupid, which angered Grant and he accused him of sticking up for Sharon, but Phil assured him he was merely concerned for his welfare. He persuaded Grant that if the two of them didn't stick together, Grant would end up back in prison. He promised Grant that he'd do anything for him and as Grant began to weep Phil promised that from now on, it will be just the two of them. =Pat Evans and Peggy Mitchell (27 October 1998)= This episode featured Pat Evans (Pam St Clement) and Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor). Peggy was on the warpath after being told about a fabricated affair between her fiancé Frank (Mike Reid) and his ex-wife Pat. However, Pat had other concerns. Her husband, Roy Evans (Tony Caunter), had driven off like a suicidal maniac nearly hitting her in the process. As Frank sped off after Roy, Pat and Peggy waited it out in the Evans household and made their feelings to each other clear. Pat was in shock about Roy nearly hitting her, but convinced herself that he merely didn't see her. Peggy was not so sure and commented that running her down was cheaper than divorce, and suggested that Roy had also found out about her affair. Pat insisted that nothing happened between her and Frank, but Peggy took a lot of convincing, and they both traded insults at each other. Pat told Peggy that Frank talked about her a lot, but Peggy couldn't accept this and when Pat left the room for a bath, Peggy began to sob. Pat eventually joined her and Peggy accused her of still loving Frank. Pat didn't quite deny it, but said she has moved on and knows when to give up on something. Peggy was convinced that Frank had feelings for Pat too. After opening a bottle of wine Pat began to feel sorry for herself, saying that she was cursed and turned rich, happy men into disasters - Roy was broke and impotent, whereas Frank who has spent a couple of years away from her, was back to his old virile self. Peggy was amazed to discover that Roy was impotent and Pat was quick to point out that sex wasn't important and she was happy to have finally found a man who wanted her to settle down. After the police arrived to inform Pat that their search for Roy had been fruitless, Peggy pestered them for some information, which made her suspect that Roy had come to harm. Now feeling more sympathetic Peggy went to converse with Pat, but the atmosphere soon became frosty once again when each began to recount their wonderful times with Frank. Pat stuck the knife in further by saying that she could have slept with Frank if she'd wanted to the night before, he still fancied her and the least encouragement would have sufficed. The bitching continued with Pat branding Peggy \\"mutton dressed as lamb\\" and Peggy blaming Pat's appearance for Roy's impotence. Their rowing finally descended into violence as both ladies threw wine glasses at each other and then a fight started when Peggy grabbed the edge of the kitchen table and threw it over to clear the way to attack Pat. The episode ended with Pat slapping Peggy, saying \\"YOU BITCH!\\" and Peggy slapping Pat right back, exclaiming \\"YOU COW!\\", right before the doorbell rang. =Roy Evans and Frank Butcher (29 October 1998)= Occurring simultaneously to the Pat Evans (Pam St Clement) and Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor) two-hander described above, this episode featured Roy Evans (Tony Caunter) and Frank Butcher (Mike Reid). After Roy sped off nearly hitting Pat with his car, Frank followed him and forced him to rethink a drastic decision. Frank followed Roy's car as he sped off extremely erratically. Eventually, Roy turned into a multi-storey car park, drove to the top and crashed the car into some rubble. He then made his way to the roof, and stood on the edge contemplating suicide. Frank followed and tried to persuade him to get down, saying he should think about his family, who will blame themselves and about Pat who thinks that he tried to kill her earlier. Roy claimed that he didn't see her, but added that it was all hopeless and he had lost everything, so there was no point living. Frank pointed out that he had a family who loved him and money was not important. Frank eventually persuaded him to come down to talk, promising that if he felt the same afterwards, he would bring him back and not stop him from taking his own life. Roy agreed and the two of them went to a strip club and ordered a couple of brandies. Roy continued to explain the reason for his depression. He had been conned in a car deal and was facing bankruptcy. Frank told Roy that they had more in common than he might think, as he once tried to commit suicide too, was left bankrupt and he made the mistake of not going back to Pat then, but for Roy it wasn't too late. Roy felt that Pat was still in love with Frank, and then accidentally let slip about his impotency, which only humiliated him further. Frank was understanding and promised he wouldn't tell anyone, and he in turn shared a story with Roy, relaying that he had fathered a child with some young girl he met when he had his breakdown, and no one else knew. Roy was comforted to know that Frank had skeletons in his closet too, and eventually agreed to go home. Frank drove them back, they rang the bell at the Evanses just as Peggy and Pat's fight was in full flow. Pat was thrilled to see Roy, and Peggy a little less thrilled to see Frank, so he asked her if they were still engaged. She responded \\"Just\\". =Matthew Rose and Steve Owen (3 February 2000)= This episode featured Steve Owen (Martin Kemp) and Matthew Rose (Joe Absolom).

When Matthew turned up at e20 nightclub Steve was shocked by the visible transformation and could see that Matthew was seeking revenge. Matthew produced a video - he had rigged Steve's flat with booby traps and Steve knew it was only a matter of time before his sister Jackie Owen (Race Davies) arrived home to trigger them. Matthew demanded £10,000. Steve tried to gain the upper hand by pulling his gun from the safe, but Matthew was one step ahead and had already removed the bullets. As they struggled Matthew grabbed a bottle and knocked Steve unconscious. He then tied and bound him to the chair. When Steve came to he tried to use a piece of smashed bottle to free himself, and managed to grab hold of the gun Matthew was waving in his face. He demanded that Matthew remove the booby traps from his flat. However Matthew stopped Steve in his tracks by revealing that he had killed Saskia's sister, Claudia (Romla Walker), and framed him for the deed, just as he had done to him. Steve buckled and fell to the floor, unable to take in what was happening. He began to beg and cry, whilst Matthew splattered petrol around the room and then pulled a zippo lighter from his pocket. As he lit the lighter and dropped it to the floor Steve was gripped with fear. However he soon realised that there was no fire or smoke. Matthew had used water instead of petrol and had invented the whole scenario to belittle him and watch him beg for mercy. =Ricky Butcher and Phil Mitchell (20 April 2000)= This episode featured Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) and his long-time employer Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). After losing his wife Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer); son Liam (Jack & Tom Godolphin); and finally his mind, Ricky said an emotional farewell to Albert Square - while Phil tried to talk him out of leaving. Ricky had sped out of Walford in his car and been involved in an accident. Phil went after him and passed the police retrieving the wreck of Ricky's car. They told him to go to the police station. Phil arrived and Ricky appeared - he had been caught over the limit doing when he crashed. Ricky was furious with Phil for allowing him to work on dodgy motors at The Arches, and was even more annoyed when he discovered that the car he had totalled was stolen. Ricky threatened to go back to the station to tell the police everything. Phil forced him to get into the car, but whilst he was being driven away he told Phil that he was not going home, and started fighting with Phil in order to get him to stop. The car swerved dangerously and Phil was forced to stop at the next service station. Phil tried to explain the situation with the car-scam, saying that he only got involved to bail Roy Evans (Tony Caunter) out and it was just a favour. Ricky was furious that he could have been jailed for helping Phil. Ricky felt that there was nothing to go back to Walford for. He had lost his wife and son and was devastated that Bianca was seeing another man. Ricky was also hurt because he had trusted Phil - he was the only thing that held him together over the last few weeks, but now he could no longer trust him. As he went to leave Phil chased him and tried to stop him leaving. However Ricky refused to let Phil push him around and informed Phil that he had purposefully driven his car into the back of the truck. Phil tried to reason that he had also lost his family. He had managed to turn his life around and Ricky could do the same. Phil tried to make Ricky think of the ramifications of his departure - Pat would dump Roy, Frank would go mad and run away again, and Phil would be dumped in it with the police. Ricky didn't care and as he began to walk off Phil shouted after him that everyone needs him to stay, and he was Ricky's friend and was there for him when he found out his unborn baby, who was named Natasha, had spina bifida. The memory stirred up buried emotions in Ricky, and as he burst into tears Phil embraced him. As dawn began to break Phil tried to coerce Ricky home by offering him partnership in The Arches. He also promised to take the rap for the dodgy motor that Ricky was driving and to sort out his nemesis Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass) for him. Phil apologized for all the things he'd done to Ricky in the past, but wanted the chance to make it up to him and turn things around. Ricky begrudgingly accepted, but when Phil left briefly to make a quick phone call, Ricky decided that he couldn't return to Walford. While Phil's back was turned, he asked a lorry driver for a lift and departed. =Kat and Zoe Slater (2 October 2001)= This episode features Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) and her daughter Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan), who up until this moment has lived her life thinking that Kat is her sister. In the previous episode, Zoe announces that she is leaving Walford to live with her uncle, Harry Slater (Michael Elphick), in Spain, but Kat is adamant that she will not. A screaming row in the street ensues and Zoe shouts \\"You can't tell me what to do, you ain't my mother!\\", to which Kat's desperate reply is, \\"Yes I am!\\". 16.9 million viewers tuned in for this episode.\\"\\"You're not my mother...\\"\\", BBC. URL last accessed on 31 October 2006. This episode began with Zoe still reeling from Kat's outburst. Back at the Slaters', Zoe demanded to know what Kat meant. Kat tried to take back what she had said, but after continuous pestering, she finally relented and admitted that what she said was the truth. This devastated Zoe, and while she locked herself in her room distraught, Kat sat outside and began to explain the reason for the deception. She had fallen pregnant when she was 13, and her parents, disappointed and ashamed, forced her to hand Zoe over to them at birth. They proceeded to bring her up as their own child. Kat relayed her heartache at having to watch her own child being brought up by her parents, and the anxiety she felt at having to pretend that she was her sister for her whole life. The lies and deception were too much for Zoe, and when she discovered that Kat had wanted to abort her, the two lashed out at each other in fury. The news made Zoe all the more determined to live with her uncle Harry in Spain, and upon hearing this Kat dropped her second bombshell - she couldn't go and live with Harry because he was her father. Kat's uncle had sexually abused her as a child, leaving her pregnant with Zoe. This meant that Zoe's father was simultaneously her great uncle. =Sonia Jackson and Dot Branning (9 May 2002)= This episode featured Sonia Jackson (Natalie Cassidy) and her step-grandmother Dot Branning (June Brown). Sonia had kidnapped the daughter she had given up for adoption and was keeping her hidden away at the Brannings'. Dot tried to reason with Sonia and shared a secret of her own. With Rebecca Miller asleep upstairs, Sonia ransacked the house for money in order to make her getaway. Dot frantically knocked at the door, shouting that Rebecca's adoptive parents, Neil Miller (Robin Sneller) and Sue Miller (Victoria Willing), were going to call the police unless Sonia let her in. Sonia tried to deny Rebecca was there, but Dot knew otherwise and made it clear that she was there to retrieve the baby for the Millers. Sonia became distressed by this, arguing that as she was Rebecca's mother she can look after her. The Millers had given Dot a deadline, she had 15 minutes to persuade Sonia to surrender Rebecca or they would involve the police. Sonia tried to explain herself. The Millers had planned to take Rebecca away without granting her a last visit. She was also upset at how much her baby had changed since she was born and she had decided that she wanted her back. Dot argued that she couldn't change her mind now that Rebecca had been adopted and she no longer had any rights as her mother. When Dot instructed Sonia to take Rebecca outside, she threatened to abscond with the baby. She begged Dot to stall the police so she could escape via the back door and was furious when Dot refused. Dot proceeded to point out that Sonia had missed out on 18 months of Rebecca's life and that she hardly knew her daughter now. Despite her pleas, Dot refused to help Sonia - and threatened to call the police herself if the kidnapping continued. Sonia became inconsolable. Dot tried to reassure her that everything would be alright, she just needed some inner strength. Sonia became angry with Dot for living her life by the Bible and Dot was mortified when she threw the holy book across the room. Sonia wondered why Dot was so willing to help her criminal son Nick Cotton (John Altman), but wouldn't help her. Dot explained that she helped Nick because she had something to make up for. She had an abortion when she was 21 years old. Her husband Charlie Cotton (Christopher Hancock) had forced her to terminate the pregnancy against her wishes. Dot described how guilty she felt after the abortion. She thought she had put it all behind her until the christening gown was found buried in the garden of Mark Fowler's (Todd Carty) house. She wished she had kept the baby, now she's left feeling cold and empty. Sonia wondered whether she should have been a single mum like her own mother Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson). She relayed that Carol was furious about the adoption, but Dot reassured her that Rebecca would have a good life with the Millers. Just as the Millers decided to call the police, Rebecca began to cry. When Sonia was unable to console her she finally realised that it was time to give her up. Tearfully, she passed Rebecca over to her relieved parents. =Phil Mitchell and Sharon Watts (5 September 2002)= This episode featured the ex-lovers Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) and Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean). Sharon and Phil had a heart to heart about their troubled pasts. They laid ghosts to rest and agreed to move on with their lives. Sharon and Phil were simultaneously having problems in their relationships. Sharon had fallen out with Tom Banks (Colm Ó Maonlaí), due to malicious stirring from his ex-wife Sadie (Isobel Middleton), and Phil had given Lisa Fowler (Lucy Benjamin) an ultimatum - she was to leave her husband Mark Fowler (Todd Carty) before the day was over. As Phil waited for Lisa to arrive in the middle of the night, he heard a knock at the door of The Queen Victoria public house. He opened the door expecting to find Lisa, but found Sharon instead. Sharon declared that she and Tom were over. Phil accused her of being stroppy and spoilt and she retaliated by accusing him of using Lisa so he could get his hands on their daughter, Louise Mitchell (Rachel Cox). The ex-lovers began drinking and flirting and talked about their past relationship. As they talked Phil relaxed and opened up about his father. Phil relayed how he idolised his father but that all changed when he saw how badly he treated his mother. He admitted that his deepest wish was to be a good father and expressed his sorrow that his two children were living with other men. Phil began to shake with emotion as he recalled the beatings he received from his father, whilst his brother Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp) could do no wrong. After one horrific Christmas, Phil vowed to run away and he still carried the note he was going to leave his parents. He never did run away, but the violence continued until he was big enough to fight back. Sharon had also had issues with her parents. She loved them both, but was caught in the middle of their volatile marriage. After they rowed, they used to compete with each other for her affections. Sharon then realised that they both had to stop living in the past. She decided to sell her share in The Queen Vic as it reminded her of her parents and Grant. Phil agreed to buy her out. Sharon then urged Phil to put his troubled relationship with his father behind him. Their heart to heart helped her to realise that she wanted to make a go of things with Tom. As Sharon left, Phil took the note that he wrote when he was a boy out of his pocket. He set it on fire to signify that it was time for him to move on too. =Little Mo and Trevor Morgan (31 October 2002)= This episode featured Little Mo Morgan (Kacey Ainsworth) and her abusive husband Trevor Morgan (Alex Ferns). It was the night of Little Mo and Billy Mitchell's (Perry Fenwick) engagement party. Trevor snatched Little Mo from the party at Angie's Den and imprisoned her in the Slater house. To make matters worse, Trevor's baby son Sean was his other hostage. Trevor had imprisoned Little Mo in the Slater house. He called her stupid for believing he'd ever grant her a divorce. Ominously, he reminded her of their marriage vows - including \\"till death us do part\\". Trevor began to weep as he admitted he was totally obsessed with Little Mo. He was furious that she had been unfaithful to him with Billy and reminded her that she will always be his. Little Mo was disgusted and wondered how Trevor had ended up in such a pitiful state. The early years of their marriage had been happy - so why did Trevor start beating her? He explained that he couldn't stand sharing her and resented the time she spent caring for her sick mother, Viv (Debi Gibson). He never liked Viv, and was glad when she died. Trevor raged that it wasn't enough for him to be part of her family, he wanted to be all of it. Trevor then turned violent, pushed Little Mo against the wall and reminded her that he'd kill her if she ever slept with another man. Terrified, Little Mo tried to escape but found that all the doors were locked. She ran upstairs in a panic, but Trevor followed and threw her to the ground saying that she will never hurt him again. Half-crazed with anger, Trevor barked questions at Little Mo, forcing her to admit that it was morally wrong for her, as his wife, to sleep with another man. He claimed that Billy couldn't possibly love her like he did. His questions took on an intimate nature and as he made a move towards Little Mo she recoiled in fear, but Trevor then declared there was no time for that, he had other plans for her. After calmly leaving the room, Little Mo followed to find Trevor pouring petrol on the stairs and suddenly she heard baby Sean crying upstairs. Out of desperation, Little Mo claimed that she still loved Trevor and she had never wanted a divorce. Thinking fast, she blamed Billy for turning her against him. She tore off her engagement ring and threw it away. Trevor slumped to the ground, eager to believe that she still loved him. Little Mo beckoned to him and they embraced. As she cradled him in her arms he sobbed that he never meant to hurt her. Little Mo suggested they go away together, but that she first needed to return Sean to his mother. When Trevor tried to get romantic, Little Mo shrieked and shook him off. Realising that he was being fooled, Trevor turned violent and Little Mo froze with fear, but seeing Billy's ring on the carpet gave her courage. She stared at Trevor and proclaimed that she wasn't frightened of him anymore. She told him that she could see him for what he was - a coward and a bully. Shocked at her defiance, Trevor whispered that she should be scared, but Little Mo was defiant and told him that he didn't have the guts to go through with his threat. She lit a match forcing an alarmed Trevor to grab it from her. In his haste the match fell to the floor and flames began to fill the room, Trevor was killed though Little Mo and the baby survived. =Lisa Fowler and Phil Mitchell (27 March 2003)= This episode featured Lisa Fowler (Lucy Benjamin) and her ex-boyfriend Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) in flashbacks to October 2002 while Phil recounts the events to Kate Morton (Jill Halfpenny). After Lisa abducted Phil's daughter and fled to Portugal, Phil tracked her down and was adamant that he was returning to Walford with his daughter. Phil had been suspected of killing Lisa and had her blood on his jacket and had burned her passport when he returned the UK. Kate was eager to get the truth and asked outright if Phil had killed Lisa. After fleeing from Phil, Lisa was trapped at the edge of a cliff grasping their daughter, Louise Mitchell (Rachel Cox). Phil implored her to move away from the cliff edge, but Lisa was terrified and yelled at Phil to get away from her. Phil stepped back and urged Lisa to consider Louise's safety and slowly, Lisa moved away from the edge. Lisa saw a man walking his dog and shouted in vain for help. Her yelling made Louise cry and Lisa tried to calm her with a lullaby. Phil was biding his time and refused to leave without Louise. Lisa finally began to calm down so Phil led to her to an abandoned cottage so they could talk. As they settled inside Phil remarked how beautiful his daughter was, and paid the same compliment to Lisa. He told Lisa that he missed them both so much. Lisa was suspicious, but after continual pressure she allowed Phil to hold Louise. Phil tried to persuade Lisa that children need their fathers', and whilst Lisa admitted that she missed her own father she insisted that neither of them were going back with Phil. Phil tried to keep her talking, he questioned her about her father. Lisa confessed that she had a recurring dream involving her dad. As she recalled the dream, she becomes highly distraught and informed him that it involved coffins and babies. Phil found this disturbing and did his best to convince Lisa that she wasn't well. He offered to arrange the professional help that she obviously needed, but Lisa accused Phil of trying to trap her into returning to England. Phil immediately got defensive, he continued his mind games and managed to make Lisa consider that a life in Portugal, with an unskilled, jobless mother was not appropriate for their daughter. Phil fired question after question at Lisa, and the continual probing began to baffle Lisa. As he saw it, she had no money and no plans. It was not enough to merely love her daughter if she couldn't provide for her. He told her that babies need stability and their first year was hugely important. Lisa had moved from man to man, and from one place to another in that time. Distressed, Lisa put her hands over her ears, whilst Phil continued to rant that she was not fit to look after a dog, let alone a baby. He declared that Lisa was mentally unstable and Louise was not safe with her. Phil urged Lisa to do what was best for Louise. Exhausted by Phil's personal attacks, Lisa fell quiet. Phil then stated calmly that if she tried to stop him taking Louise, he'd have her committed. Lisa protested that the only mad thing she had ever done was get involved with him, but Phil proceeded to plants doubts in her mind. He reminded her that she shot him and left him for dead and asked if that was how a sane person behaved. Lisa was visibly distressed and shaking. Sensing that the moment was right, Phil ordered her to fetch Louise and hand her over to him. Bewildered, Lisa obeyed him. He then announced that it was best if Lisa didn't ever try to return to Walford. He was prepared to reveal all about the shooting if she did. Lisa staggered outside in confusion and grief. Phil ignored her howls of anguish and walked away with Louise whilst Lisa stared over the edge of the cliff. =Den and Sharon Watts (30 September 2003)= This episode reunited Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) with his adoptive daughter Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean), after she had spent 14 years thinking that he was dead. Sharon had the shock of her life when her father emerged from the shadows and muttered \\"Hello, Princess!\\". Sharon couldn't believe that her father was still alive. Den did his best to explain where he'd been, but Sharon was torn between delight and anger. Sharon touched Den, dumbstruck to see her dad after all these years, but before she had a chance to take it in she began to feel nauseous and ran to the toilet to be violently sick. Upon her return, Den proceeded to try to explain himself. Sharon stared in disbelief and wanted to know how he could let her think that he was dead all this time. As emotions began to run high, Sharon revealed that she'd never stopped grieving for him. Den explained that he couldn't take the risk in contacting her, or they would have both been in danger. Den only felt safe to return to Walford after hearing that Jack Dalton (Hywel Bennett) had died; Dalton was a local gangland boss and leader of the square's criminal organization known as \\"The Firm\\", which was responsible for the events of Den's attempted murder and presumed death back 14 years ago. Den apologized to Sharon for never having the guts to get in touch. Sharon sobbed as she recalled the last conversation she ever had with him. She washed her hands of him, and the next thing she knew he was dead. She'd regretted her harsh words ever since, she thought he'd died thinking that she hated him. Sharon confessed that she'd made a mess of her life. Things would have been easier if he'd been around. Just his voice on the end of the phone would have helped. Den had tears in his eyes as he hugged Sharon. As the two began to bond, Den brought the conversation round to his first wife and Sharon's adoptive mother, Angie Watts (Anita Dobson) and offended Sharon by referring to her as a \\"barmy old lush\\". Sharon announced that Angie had died. Den didn't even know. Furious, Sharon then decided it was too late for Den to make amends, and yelled at him to leave her alone. Den did as she wanted and wandered through the Square, before breaking into The Queen Vic, the pub he used to own. Den surveyed the pub and Sharon followed him inside. They drank a toast to Angie and Sharon revealed how she nursed her mum during the painful final days of her fatal illness. Den reflected that he had some good times in the pub, but Sharon could not remember many good times – she just recalled her parents' furious rows. She mentioned how she once ran it with Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp), whom Den had never even heard of. Sharon then remembered that she had an axe to grind with her father, for getting her best friend Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully) pregnant when she was only 16. Den tried to explain what happened between him and Michelle, but Sharon was furious with him for cheating on her mother and blamed him for sending her to an early grave. Sharon decided that she was not going to allow Den to ruin her life again. Den tried to calm her, but Sharon insisted that doesn't need him - before then going on to claim that her sister Vicki Fowler (Scarlett Johnson) and their half-brother, Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman), don't need their father as well. Den instantly assumed that Dennis was Sharon's boyfriend and argued with her that he wasn't important. This prompted Sharon to reveal that he wasn't her boyfriend, Dennis was his son. Den became surprised as the episode finished. =Den Watts and Dennis Rickman (1 April 2004)= This episode featured Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) and Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman). Father and son went head to head in The Queen Vic. Both were desperate to win the battle. It ended with violence, and one being the definite loser. Den had just discovered that his adoptive daughter, Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean), was sleeping with his son, Dennis. He was not happy. In The Queen Vic, Den took Dennis aside for a chat. Dennis sat down with trepidation but was amazed that Den was so calm. He explained that he and Sharon were in love, but Den had doubts. With Dennis showing no signs of budging, Den reluctantly decided to that Dennis had to be forced away from Sharon rather than persuaded. When Dennis referred to their bonding chat last Christmas and that he was glad that Den now knew about him and Sharon, Den mocked him cruelly, claiming that their prior bonding was all an act. He was only pretending when he acted fatherly towards him and didn't care about him in the slightest. Dennis was hurt and taken aback and as Den belittled him further, remembering the way Dennis melted when he called him \\"son\\", Dennis became enraged. Den continued his diatribe on Dennis, threatening to inform Sharon that he had killed Jack Dalton (Hywel Bennett), but it wasn't enough to scare Dennis off. Den continued to goad him, asking how long it would be before he turned his attentions to his biological sister, Vicki Fowler (Scarlett Johnson), and Dennis was sickened by the remark. Den argued that Dennis couldn't tell the difference between female relatives and lovers. He taunted Dennis about his background, telling him that years of misery and abuse had turned him into the man that he was. Dennis managed to remain calm and was sure that Den was closer to losing his temper than he was. Dennis said he realised that they would always be at loggerheads with each other. He had let Den triumph before, because he thought he wanted a father, but even though Den had put up a good fight, he wasn't going to let him win this time. Den became enraged and asserted that his and Sharon's affair was over. He ordered Dennis to leave, but Dennis replied repeatedly that he loved Sharon. Calmly, he prepared to head home to her. Seeing that he was losing the fight Den turned angry and hurled Dennis through the doors of The Queen Vic. Father and son stood head to head, while Dennis bragged about Sharon leaving with him. Cockily, he shoved his father aside. Furious, Den spat out that some twisted pervert must have got to Dennis in the past, and caused him to think that a relationship with his own sister was acceptable. He described the abuse Dennis must have suffered in care and waved goodbye to the son he never wanted. Dennis finally snapped and lunged at him out of control, but was restrained. Eventually he broke free and lashed out, accidentally punching Sharon, who had just arrived, in the process. A victorious Den then took Sharon home. =Kat Slater and Alfie Moon (25 May 2004)= This episode featured Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) and Alfie Moon (Shane Richie). Alfie had been given a video of Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs) sleeping with his wife, Kat. Alfie owed Andy money and when he couldn't pay he Andy threatened his safety. Kat slept with Andy as a trade for her husband's life, but Alfie could not accept her excuses. The episode began with a jovial Kat returning home, but her mood soon changed after she saw that Andy had filmed their sordid liaison and maliciously given it to Alfie to watch. Alfie was in pieces and couldn't bear to look at his wife. As Kat pleaded with Alfie to listen to her explanation, he refused, so Kat screamed that she did it all for him. Alfie was disgusted and called her a cheap little slapper. Hurt, Kat slapped Alfie and he slapped her right back, leaving Kat stunned that he could do such a thing. As it all sunk in Alfie broke down in tears, whilst Kat desperately tried to protest that Andy tricked her. Alfie could only laugh at her feeble excuse. She told him that she did it to protect him and because she loved him, but Alfie felt hurt and betrayed. He suggested that she go back to Andy, as he didn't want her anywhere near him. Through his tears and anguish Alfie revealed the guilt he'd always carried about his parents' death in a car crash and how he blamed himself for not fixing something his dad asked him to. Now he can't live with the thought that his negligence ruined things again. He told Kat that their marriage was over and Kat had no choice but to pack her bags. As she was about to go Alfie questioned her more about her motives and Kat tried to make him realise that Andy's behaviour was all about revenge and that they can get past this and stay together. As Alfie continued to reject her, Kat turned on him and brought up her past sexual abuse at the hands of her uncle Harry Slater (Michael Elphick) and likened it to her affair with Andy. Sobbing, she made one last attempt to change his mind and asked him to give her a cuddle. However, Alfie's pride wouldn't let him take her back and he showed her the door. As Kat left The Queen Vic in tears she heard the door open and saw Alfie there. She held out her hand and he took it.

Den and Dot forced each other to examine their relationships with others. Late one evening Den spotted some youths vandalising the launderette. After seeing off the thugs, Dot emerged from the back room and Den could see that she had been crying. Dot began to engage Den in conversation about his wife Chrissie Watts (Tracy-Ann Oberman) and how he felt now that she had left him. Den's response was blasé, which angered Dot and she accused him of putting up a front. Dot chastised Den for his demeanour and pointed out that he couldn't face up to his own guilt. She told him that he treated his friends and family appallingly and when he had heard enough and turned to leave, he found that Dot had locked him in and refused to give him the keys. As Den was forced to continue the conversation Dot pestered him more about Chrissie and threatened to haunt him if he didn't plead Chrissie for forgiveness. Eventually, Dot informed Den that she was dying and he was shocked to hear that she had kidney cancer. However Dot became cagey when Den quizzed her about her illness. He wanted her to have the best care possible and even offered to pay for it, but Dot rejected his help - she had chosen not to have her cancer treated. She wanted to face death with dignity and begged Den to keep her secret quiet as even her husband, Jim, didn't know she was suffering. Den wasn't convinced by Dot's motives for keeping her illness from Jim, but she believed that she was acting in his best interests. Den insisted that Dot's deceit would destroy her marriage and told her to open up to Jim. Den then slyly told her that if she didn't come clean with Jim, she couldn't take the moral high ground next time he messed up. They both decided that they needed to sort their marriages out. When Jim arrived to collect Dot, Den explained that she was sorting him out and squeezed Dot's hand tenderly before leaving.

The cast had been told there was a special episode coming up, but that it would actually feature three characters, one being Archie's murderer. Wood described Ashdown's script as \\"amazing\\", saying that Ashdown knows the characters inside out, and hoped he could do the script justice. Wood and Turner were given three days to rehearse. One 19-minute scene took up 26 pages in the script, and was filmed in two takes. The entire episode was filmed in three night shoots and one studio shoot. It was originally scheduled to be filmed over three days, but a fourth day was added for on-location filming. The episode follows on from the previous episode where Max discovers where his daughter-in-law Stacey is staying after the death of her husband, Bradley (Charlie Clements), and her confession to the murder of Archie. Max goes up to her flat and enters, pressing her for details of Archie's murder, the night of Bradley's death and what she had done in her absence. Stacey reveals that after she fled the morgue, she contemplated suicide but could not bring herself to do it for the sake of her unborn child; she then went to her mother's old flat which was deserted and did not move for three days; eventually leaving to buy food and drink. Max tells her that he wants to hand her in to the police. Max then chases Stacey outside, where she trips and he catches her. He then drags Stacey to a car, which he breaks into and bundles her into. He then hot-wires the car and drives to a police station. After telling Stacey that she must confess to her mother and the Mitchells first, he drives her back to Walford where he eventually changes his mind after expressing that Bradley would want her to be happy. The episode ends with them both entering their respective houses and the camera panning up over Walford, rising so high that it morphs into the EastEnders credits. =Sharon Mitchell and Michelle Fowler (12 January 2017)= This episode features Michelle Fowler (Jenna Russell) revealing to her best friend Sharon Mitchell (Letitia Dean) her reasons for returning to the United Kingdom after 20 years. Although their scenes are interspersed with scenes of Dot Branning (June Brown) at home waiting for her cat, and the episode credits 20 characters, it was officially considered a two-hander by BBC Store and was included in their \\"EastEnders: Two's Company\\" collection of two-hander episodes. = Phil Mitchell and Jay Brown (21 August 2017) = During this episode, Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) explains to Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick) why he has given him the car lot, which is worth £300,000 rather than giving it to his son Ben Mitchell (Harry Reid), who received the lesser valued Arches. Phil tells Jay that Jase Dyer (Stephen Lord) was not his biological father as he didn't know Jay's mother until two months after his birth. Phil tells Jay that a tramp living rough around Albert Square, named Alan Hall, was his birth father and that in an insurance scam back in 1994 he and Frank Butcher (Mike Reid) committed arson to the car lot and that they weren't aware Alan was sleeping in one of the cars within. Phil attempts to persuade Jay that there would be no point in going to prison because he is still paying for the crime in the form of guilt. At the end of the episode Jay is seen sat at \\"Jase's bench\\" while Phil is seen making a phone call to an unknown person, he tells them that he's \\"done it\\" and \\"fed him [Jay] a pack of lies and that it's now their turn to keep to the deal\\". = Linda Carter and Stuart Highway (13 December 2018) = A two-hander between Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) and Stuart Highway (Ricky Champ). Linda's husband, Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) is in prison because Stuart claims Mick shot him but Linda believes that Stuart is lying. In this episode, Linda seduces Stuart and during their passion, she says Mick used to have an unpredictable energy like Stuart does now, and would have believed he shot someone back then but not now in an attempt to gain a confession. Stuart becomes suspicious and while Linda is out of the room, he finds a recording device hidden behind the bed, which he reveals to Linda. She calls him stupid, saying he thought she liked him but she was repulsed. In the bar, he rants about how Mick has everything and he never cared when Stuart went to prison for something Mick did when they were teenagers. Linda says Stuart made his own decisions and now wants someone to blame because he has nobody in his life. He attempts to rape her but she smashes a bottle on his head, saying he would never have the nerve to pull the trigger but Mick would, to which Stuart says Mick did not shoot him and he leaves. Linda then takes a second recording device she had hidden in her hair and transfers Stuart's confession to her laptop. Three and four- hander episodes EastEnders is also notable for featuring three and four- hander episodes. Within three-hander episodes three characters usually interact separately with each other in differing scenes, whilst four-handers often include two sets of characters stories which occur simultaneously, although they are not directly connected to each other there is usually a linking theme. =Notable three-handers= * Kathy Beale, Pete Beale and James Willmott-Brown (13 February 1992) - Kathy finally laid to rest the ghost of her rape and convinced Pete that their marriage was truly over. * Sharon Watts, Grant Mitchell and Phil Mitchell (3 September 1992) - After Phil had slept with his brother's wife, Sharon, the protagonists had to deal with the aftermath and the possibility that Grant would discover what had happened. Phil made it clear that he was willing to tell Grant, but when the moment came Sharon decided to choose Grant rather than Phil. * Martin Fowler, Sonia Fowler and Sarah Cairns (22 October 2004) - Whilst Sarah, Martin's stalker, held his wife Sonia against her will at the Fowlers, Martin was facing a race against time in order to rescue his marriage.

Executive producer Diederick Santer described the episode as \\"exciting and unique\\", and said, \\"We realised that three of our most loved female characters had big turning points this week — Ronnie trying to make the right decision about her relationship with Joel, Dot facing a tough choice about Jim and Bianca finally allowing herself to recognise her true feelings for Ricky. We decided to give those characters [...] some space to thrash out their dilemmas in the form of a (nearly) three-handed episode. Usually when we do a two-hander, we're playing out a story for two characters who are very close, but in this case, unusually, we're featuring characters who don't usually relate to one another. But that is what makes this episode all the more exciting and unique.\\" *Janine Butcher, Michael Moon and Alice Branning (1 November 2013) - Michael had been planning the murder of his wife Janine.

He was awarded the nation's highest military decoration for valor—the Medal of Honor, for his actions aboard the during the battle with Confederate Marines and artillery batteries at Fort Darling near Richmond, Virginia, on May 15, 1862. He is one of the first two Marines to be awarded the Medal of Honor, and is considered to be the first Marine to receive the Medal of Honor in the history of the Marine Corps. Biography Mackie enlisted in the Marine Corps from New York on April 24, 1861. His first assignment was with the Marine Detachment on board the USS Savannah. He was promoted to corporal on March 1, 1862. On April 1, he began serving on the ironclad warship USS Galena. On May 15, a five-ship Union Navy squadron, including the Galena, steamed up the James River to test the defenses of the Confederate capital, Richmond, Virginia. After reaching a bend in the river upstream of Dutch Gap, the squadron encountered submerged obstacles and heavy fire from two battalions of Confederate Marines positioned on the banks of the river and artillery fire from Fort Darling atop Drewry's Bluff about eight miles below Richmond. Mackie commanded 12 Marines on the gun deck. The fort's artillery batteries inflicted severe damage on the Galena and forced the Union squadron to turn back. During the battle (which would come to be known as the Battle of Drewry's Bluff), most of Galena's naval gun crew was killed or wounded. Mackie led a group of Marines who took over operation of the guns for the remainder of the battle. On November 1, he was promoted to orderly sergeant. In June 1863, he was assigned to the . On July 10, 1863, Mackie was awarded the Medal of Honor (Navy version) for his actions aboard the Galena on May 15, 1862. Mackie was particularly mentioned for his \\"gallant conduct and services and signal acts of devotion to duty\\".\\"John Mackie\\", in Record of Medals of Honor Issued to the Officers and Enlisted Men of the United States Navy Marine Corps and Coast Guard, 1862-1817, Roll of Honor, p. 71. Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1917. On October 11, 1863, he received the medal by U.S. Postal Service mail while aboard the Seminole which was anchored off Sabine Pass, Texas. Mackie was presented the Medal of Honor during a ceremony on the quarterdeck of the ship. He was honorably discharged from the Marine Corps on August 23, 1865, in Boston. Mackie and Sergeant Pinkerton Vaughn (, 1863) were the first Marines to be awarded the Medal of Honor. Mackie eventually married and settled near Philadelphia. He died at the age of 74 and is buried in Arlington Cemetery, in the Drexel Hill section of Upper Darby, Pennsylvania. At Drewry's Bluff, now within Richmond National Battlefield Park, a marker is posted which features Mackie's Medal of Honor action.

It was built in 1804 by James Plumb, and is exceptionally well preserved. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. The house is built with clapboard sidings, a brownstone foundation and an asphalt shingle roof. It has a wood frame, with post and beam construction and a hip roof. The architect and builder are unknown. Historically and currently it has been a private residence. Significance James Plumb, a well-to-do farmer in Westfield, built this house in 1804 on land inherited from his father, Samuel Plumb. The house remained in the Plumb-Barry family until 1888; since then it has passed through a succession of owners while retaining its traditional residential usage. This finely-scaled Federal style frame house is of a central hall plan; its exterior displays a symmetrical five-bay facade with hip roof and twin chimneys. A denticulated main cornice and delicate window caps add decorative interest to the facade, while attention is drawn to the entrance by a columned porch with cove ceiling. The possibility exists that the northeast kitchen wing is Samuel Plumb's own dwelling house, built around 1740, and relegated to a minor role as an attached dependency by the subsequent construction of James Plumb's \\"Mansion House\\". The large original condition of this house, together with its distinctive appearance and compatible site, makes it a rare and pleasing example of early Federal style architecture in Middletown. Relationship to surroundings This house faces south from the northeast corner of Westfield and East Streets. Tall shade trees shield the house from the nearby roads.

Redding recorded three sacks on the season. In a divisional playoff game against the Pittsburgh Steelers on January 15, 2011, Redding scored his first career touchdown after recovering a fumble by Ben Roethlisberger. Redding had another solid season in 2011, recording 4 sacks and helping the Ravens defense allow the 2nd fewest yards in the league. =Indianapolis Colts= Redding signed with the Indianapolis Colts on March 14, 2012.Ravens' Cory Redding signs with Colts =Arizona Cardinals= Redding signed with the Arizona Cardinals on March 11, 2015.

It is a medium-sized bird about long with a long black tail with a red base. Males have greyish-brown upper parts, a chestnut crown and breast, and dark facial markings. Females are similar but lack the chestnut crown and have streaked, buff underparts. There is a wing bar which is white in the male and buff in the female. This is a fairly common species with a wide range, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\". Description It is a stocky bird, 18-20 centimetres in length, with short wings and a red eye. The longish tail is black with a reddish base. The upperparts of the male are grey-brown with dark streaks while the crown and underparts are chestnut- coloured. There is a white bar on the wing and a pattern of dark and pale areas on the face. Females have buff underparts with brown streaks and have buff rather than white in the wings. They do not have the males' chestnut crown but may show a cinnamon wash to the forehead and throat. The song is a series of stuttering notes followed by a rasping trill similar to the noise made by a fishing reel. The finch-like bill is short and thick with serrated edges and is used for stripping off buds, leaves and fruits. Insects are eaten on occasions and are fed to the chicks. Distribution and habitat The rufous-tailed plantcutter is found further south than any other cotinga, inhabiting scrub, forest edge and river valleys in Chile and western Argentina. The range extends from Magallanes region north to Atacama in Chile and from Santa Cruz north to Mendoza in Argentina. Birds breeding in southern or high-altitude regions move northwards or towards the lowlands in winter. It has been recorded as a vagrant to the Falkland Islands. Birds are often seen in gardens, farmland and orchards and are sometimes considered to be a pest. The nest is a cup of root fibres and twigs built in a fork in a shrub or tree. Two to four eggs are laid, they are blue-green with dark spots concentrated at the larger end. Status This bird has a very wide range and though not particularly common, is presumed to have a large total population. The population trend is thought to be stable and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated the bird's conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\".

As of 2005, the United States Department of State reports that approximately 24,000 Christians live in Mongolia's capital, Ulaanbaatar, which is around 2.5 percent of the entire registered population of the city. Most Christians in Mongolia became Christian after the Mongolian Revolution of 1990. According to the Christian missionary group Barnabas Fund, the number of Christians grew from just four in 1989 to around 40,000 as of 2008.Religions in Mongolia  Statistics  According to the 2010 National Census there were 41,117 Christians (age of 15 and older) or 2.1% of total population.National Census 2010 Nestorianism Nestorianism was the first form of Christianity to be proselytized among the Mongols, in the 7th century, and several Mongols, at least a dozen, became primarily Christian. During the rise of the Mongol Empire in the 13th century, the Great Khans, though mostly Shamanists and Buddhist, were religiously tolerant towards the Nestorian Christians, Muslims, and Manichaeans. Many of the khans had Nestorian Christian wives from the Kerait clan, who were extremely influential in the Mongol court. During the rule of Möngke Khan, Christianity was the primary religious influence. After the breakup of the Mongol Empire in the 14th century, Nestorian Christianity nearly disappeared from the region.Gaby Bamana, ed., Christianity and Mongolia: Past and Present (Ulaanbaatar: Antoon Mostaert Center, 2006). There are only very few archeological traces of the prospering of Nestorianism among the Mongols., p.45 In Inner Mongolia, several Nestorian gravestones have been recorded in the past, but none now remain in situ.Tjalling H. F. Halbertsma, Early Christian Remains of Inner Mongolia: Discovery, Reconstruction, and Appropriation (Leiden: Brill, 2008). Orthodoxy Holy Trinity Church, Ulaanbaatar The Orthodox Churches and their monks became victims to the Mongol invasion of Eastern Europe in the early 13th century. However, Jarlig or charter of immunity, also contributed to the strengthening of the Church. With the reign of Möngke-Temür, a jarlig was issued to Metropolitan Kirill for the Orthodox Church in 1267. While the church had been under the de facto protection of the Mongols ten years earlier (from the 1257 census conducted under Khan Berke), this jarlig formally decreed protection for the Orthodox Church. More importantly, it officially exempted the church from any form of taxation by Mongol or Russian authorities and permitted clergymen to remain unregistered during censuses and clergy were furthermore not liable for forced labor or military service. For the first time, the Orthodox church would become less dependent on princely powers than in any other period of Russian history.Halperin, Charles J. \\"George Vernadsky, Eurasianism, the Mongols, and Russia\\", Slavic Review, Vol. 41, No. 3, Autumn, 1982: 477-493 From 1771 to 1845 at least eight missions of the Russian Orthodox Church visited Mongolia. The first Orthodox church on Mongolian territory, Holy Trinity Church was established in the Khalkha capital city Urga in 1872,L. Altanzayaa, \\"Regarding the Protection of Russian Orthodox Priests in Mongolia\\", in Bamana, ed., 79-88. and newly rebuilt there in 2007. Roman Catholicism Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral Historically, much of Europe had been ruled by Turkish and Mongolian tribes both of which originated in Mongolia. The Eastern Roman Empire was conquered by the Ottoman Turks in the 15th century. Western Catholicism was first introduced in the Middle Ages, primarily through Franciscan and Dominican missionaries, sent to the Mongol court in Karakorum and also via medieval Roman Catholic missions in China. Missionaries to China were successful during the Mongol-created Yuan Dynasty in China in the late 13th/early 14th centuries. However, after the native Chinese Ming Dynasty overthrew the Yuan Dynasty in 1368, Christians were expelled from China. Many Mongols in the western part of the Empire converted to Islam, and with the collapse of the entire Mongol Empire in the 14th century, Christianity nearly disappeared from Central Asia, only reappearing after the Second Opium War in the mid-19th century. In time, a mission was founded for Outer Mongolia, giving Mongolia its first Roman Catholic jurisdiction, but all work ceased within a year when the Mongolian People's Republic was established and freedom of thought and religion were no longer permitted.Jeroom Heyndrickx, \\"The Catholic Mongol Mission\\", in Bamana, ed., 89-104. After the Mongolian Revolution of 1990, Roman Catholic missionaries returned and rebuilt the church from scratch. As of 2006, there is an Apostolic Prefecture, a bishop, three churches, and diplomatic relations between the Holy See and Mongolia since 1992. Pope John Paul II originally planned to visit Mongolia along with Kazan, but he eventually cancelled the trip, supposedly explaining to a Russian newspaper that \\"Our Lord does not want it\\". By 2014, there were 919 Catholics in the Prefecture Apostolic of Ulaanbaatar, headed by Wenceslao Selga Padilla, C.I.C.M. as Prefect and organized into 6 parishes. Protestantism Protestant church in Zuunmod, Töv Province Most Christians in Mongolia today are Protestant, and most have become Christians since the Mongolian Revolution of 1990. Mongolia has a local Christian TV station, Eagle Television, and a pro-Christian radio station, Family Radio. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints In 1992, six missionaries of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints arrived in Mongolia as English teachers. In 1995, the Mongolia Ulaanbaatar Mission was established with Richard Cook as the first mission president. The Ulaanbaatar Mongolia West Stake with six congregations was formed in 2009 growing to nine congregations by May 2016. The Ulaanbaatar Mongolia East Stake was created in May 2016 with six congregations. About 2010 new visa laws went into effect limiting foreigners causing many of the foreign Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints missionaries to be reassigned to other countries.

Biography  He was born in the family of a priest. Graduated from the department of philosophy in the University of Tartu in 1840. In 1849 he became a professor of Persian and Arab literature in Moscow in the Lazarev Institute of Oriental Languages. He published a number of scholarly works and earned his doctoral dissertation on a work analyzing Ferdowsi's Shahnameh. Under the influence of the European enlightenment movement and the Russian social movement of the 1940s, Nazarian increasingly began writing against the feudal system and its ideology. In the 1950s he became the leader of the Armenian enlightenment movement. Between 1858 and 1864 he published in Moscow the influential magazine Hyusisapayl (Aurora Borealis), that had a great effect on the development of progressive public thought in Armenia. He criticized serfdom and clerical power for the spiritual revival of the Armenian people; however, he refused to classify his actions as part of a broader class struggle. Nazarian advanced the idea of public education in the new enlightenment era as well as the replacement of Classical Armenian (grabar) with the new literary Ashkarhabar. He was a supporter of deism and promoted Russian and foreign literature. Translated many of Friedrich Schiller's dramas.

Its towers are the tallest electricity pylons in the UK. The present crossing was built in 1965, and comprises two 190-metre (623 feet) tall lattice towers each side of the Thames. Some suggest that the choice of this height was deliberate, being just taller than the BT Tower in London. The span is 1372 metres (4501 feet), the minimum height of the conductors over the river is 76 metres (249 feet). Each tower has three crossarms and carries two circuits of 400 kV three-phase AC. 400 kV power lines also cross the Thames at the Thames Cable Tunnel, the Dartford Cable Tunnel, and the London Power Tunnels. 132 kV Thames Crossing There was at one time an earlier 132 kV crossing nearby, with towers 148.4 metres tall. Linking Dagenham and Crossness, it was built between 1927 and 1932 and was part of the Belvedere- Crowlands 132/33/25 kV double circuit. With the cessation of generation at Belvedere Power Station, this line was dismantled in 1987. 2006 death In March 2006, Paul Smith-Crallan attempted to BASE jump from a platform on the Swanscombe Tower. The parachute he was using is believed to have failed to open, causing him to plunge to his death. This tower is a popular base jumping location because of two platforms that provide good launch points.

In 2007, the college had 867 pupils aged 11 – 18 and a Preparatory Department with 175 students, aged 3 – 11. Victoria College has been awarded specialist school status beginning from September 2009. The college will specialise in STEM- related areas (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths).  History  Founded by Mrs Margaret Byers (1832–1912) in 1859, it is one of the longest established girls' schools in the British Isles. The college was established in Wellington Place and was first known as The Ladies' Collegiate School Belfast. In 1887, Queen Victoria's Jubilee Year, the name of the school was changed by Royal Command to Victoria College and School. A century later, Victoria College amalgamated with Richmond Lodge School, a neighbouring girls' school of similar status. The origins of Richmond Lodge lie in a school opened in 1879 by the Misses Hardy on the Stranmillis Road. It moved to the Malone Road in 1913 and soon acquired full academic recognition. Richmond Lodge past pupils continue their association with the school through the Arellian Association. From 1947 to 1970, the art department at Victoria College was headed by Mercy Hunter, a notable calligrapher and influential teacher. Over the past 150 years, Victoria College (as it is now called) has relocated several times. Former Belfast locations include Howard Street, Pakenham Place and Lower Crescent before the current school was established at Cranmore in the 1970s. School house names reflect the past locations.  Location The school has two campuses the Richmond Campus (for Forms 1 & 2) and the Cranmore Campus (for Forms 3-U6). In addition, a kindergarten for boys and girls is located within the Richmond Campus and the girls only Preparatory Department is located on the Cranmore Campus. The whole school is situated within extensive mature grounds in South Belfast. This location between two of the main arterial routes into the City is convenient to city, town and country bus routes and the local railway network. It is also within walking distance of the Queen's University Belfast and the Ulster Museum and many local art galleries and theatres.  Staff  The school is staffed by 82 full- and part-time teachers and 30 support staff.  Boarding  Drumglass House was built in 1820 and serves as the Boarding Department for girls of all ages and all backgrounds. It is located within the grounds of the Cranmore Campus. The Boarding Department caters for up to 60 boarders, many from Europe or East Asia.  150th anniversary  2009 saw the 150th anniversary of the founding of the college. Throughout 2009, events celebrating the history of the school took place. An exhibition opened in May 2009 at the college. In addition, the college has been successful in several competitions. These include F1 in Schools 2009 - National champions, GT class. UKAYRoC 2009 - Only all-girls team to finish in the top three.  STEM related achievements  In 2010, a team of pupils from the College won their regional heat of the Faraday Challengehttp://faraday.theiet.org/urbanevolution/challenge/ and subsequently took first prize at the National Finals held in Manchester.  Exam results  GCSE and A-level results in the college are consistently high every year. The exam boards offered to students are Edexcel, AQA, OCR, CCEA, WJEC.

The ASRAD Hellas is configured to enable reliable target detection, identification, and engagement during day or night under all possible conditions of visibility and weather. Due to its modularity and flexibility, the ASRAD Hellas fire unit embodies significant growth potential, permitting it to operate with passive and active surveillance sensors such as infrared search and track devices, and external surveillance 2D or 3D radars. The system is operated by a two-man team, composed of a weapons operator and a driver. Advantages *Fast deployment (less than five minutes after unloading, e.g. from a helicopter) *Fast reaction (no more than 10 seconds) *Reliable multi-target capability *High operational availability *Automatic system operation mode (limitation of human errors) *Ease of operation, training and maintenance *Automatic system test (built-in test equipment/BITE) *Stationary defense (fixed assets, area defense, remote control mode) *Mobile defense (convoys, task forces, maneuvering elements) *Cooperative logistics among user nations *Large growth potential due to the modular system concept Additional information For integrated system operations during national and international missions, the ASRAD Hellas can be equipped with additional C3I interface software for network-enabled operations and links to upper echelon allied operation centers. The system can be deployed in either stationary or mobile mode. Limitations of the STINGER missile with respect to pitch and roll acceleration on the move have had to be taken into account. During stationary operation the control and display unit (CDU) can be separated from the vehicle and connected to the system by a cable for remote operation. The maximum distance for remote control is 100 metres. Germany and Finland use similar systems.

Puyuhuapi is one of the volcanoes in the southern segment of the Andean Southern Volcanic Zone, which includes a number of stratovolcanoes. South of this southern segment, a gap without volcanic activity separates the Southern Volcanic Zone from the Austral Volcanic Zone. The volcanic field extends from the western side of the channel north over the head of the channel towards Lake Risopatrón, with one isolated cone found on the eastern side of the channel. The town of Puyuhuapi is located approximately halfway through the field. The cones on the western side are a separate group from the ones towards the north and associated with two different eruption fissures, but both fissures are associated with the Liquiñe-Ofqui fault zone. The basement on which the field is built is formed by rocks of the Patagonian Batholith. The field is formed by cinder cones, while the isolated centre is formed by a fissure fed lava flow. The southernmost cone is also the largest with a diametre of and features a high secondary cone nested within its wide summit crater. The eruption fissures also generated lava flows; the cones formed afterwards over the fissures. On the northern end of the Puyuhuapi channel, the eruptions filled part of the channel and separated Lake Risopatrón from it; this activity may have been phreatomagmatic in nature. Two edifices have a volume of and respectively. The cones were constructed by basaltic andesite, which contains clinopyroxene, olivine and plagioclase. The petrologically primitive composition suggests that they were constructed from primitive asthenosphere derived magmas that reached the surface directly, through the Liquiñe-Ofqui fault system. The cones may be extremely young, one eruption with a volume of about may have occurred about 9,000 years ago based on stratigraphy, although the date is fairly uncertain. The glacial isostasy phenomena at the end of the last ice age may have triggered the magma ascent and thus eruptions.

The building stands at the junction of Russell Street and East Main Street in South Farms. There is a small pond to the south. East Main Street's commercial and industrial development ends there. To the north, small businesses border the street, followed by the buildings of Russell Manufacturing Company, the area's most dominant feature. Russell Street crosses Sumner Brook nearby and ascends to a large residential district to the west. The mill is currently a condo-apartment complex.  Significance  This factory was erected by the Russell Manufacturing Company in 1836, and is the oldest surviving textile mill building in the city. Incorporated in 1834 by Samuel Russell, Samuel Hubbard and others, in 1841, the company was the first to produce elastic webbing on power looms. By 1896, it manufactured a wide variety of woven products and was the nation's largest manufacturer of suspenders. Approximately 900 workers were employed in the company's seven mills. The original brick structure, identified as the \\"Webb Mill\\" on the 1859 Walling map, runs parallel to Sumner Brook. A mill race once flowed through the building. The long main factory section has a gabled roof trimmed by a corbeled brick cornice moulding. The exterior of the structure has vertical, metal supports that reinforce the brick walls. The two mansard roofed ells, added prior to 1874, have a number of gabled dormers. A smokestack and decorative towers that crowned different parts of the roof were removed after 1896. The building, together with dam and pond nearby, reflects South Farms' early industrial history. The success of the Russell Manufacturing Company transformed the area into a thriving city district. Three company factories bordered the brook here in 1850. Of these, this structure is the last remaining building.

Forest Glade forms a large section of the Windsor's border with Tecumseh, Ontario and is situated near the former town of Riverside, Ontario. It has an estimated population of 19,000 people. The physical borders of the community are Tecumseh Road east to the north, Banwell Road to the east, Lauzon Road to the west, and E.C. Row Expressway to the south. Forest Glade is accessed from three directions: West (off Lauzon Parkway), north (off Tecumseh Road East), and east (off Banwell Road). Nearby to a Tecumseh Road entrance is an entrance to the Ganatchio Trail, as well as a multitude of fast food restaurants, Tecumseh Mall, and several grocery stores. It has quick access to E.C. Row Expressway and is home to the easternmost sections of Transit Windsors 1C, 4, and 10 bus routes, providing excellent access to virtually anywhere in the city. Community landmarks Forest Glade features an Optimist Club, twin ice pads at Forest Glade Arena, along with the Forest Glade branch of the Windsor Public Library. Also notable are a public skate park, baseball diamonds, and tennis courts. These facilities collectively are referred to as the Forest Glade Community Centre. There are three public elementary schools in the area: Forest Glade Public School, Parkview Public School, and Eastwood Public School. In addition to these, there are two Catholic school board schools: L.A. Desmarais and H.J. Lassaline. Housing in Forest Glade generally consists of freestanding single family homes, owned as opposed to rented. There are a number of apartment buildings, but the majority of the population of the area live in houses. Numerous churches and religious places are present in the community. A shopping plaza, or small strip mall, is located near the Community Centre. Character Although Forest Glade, or simply \\"The Glade\\" is an official part of the City of Windsor, many residents show a sense of patriotism that would suggest it were an independent town. Forest Glade is well known amongst Windsorites for having many winding and confusing roads. It is very easy to get lost in Forest Glade as there are many crescents and some of the streets even intersect themselves. Numerous crescent-type streets are renamed halfway along them, making navigation for people unfamiliar with the area difficult at best. The community is an example of a planned community, as until the late 1960s, the area was mainly farmland, with fewer than a dozen houses in the area.

Birth and family Alfred was born in the rural community of Pleasant Valley, Prairie Ronde Township, near the town of Schoolcraft, Kalamazoo County, Michigan. His is the story of a farm boy who responded to the call of the far horizon to become a world citizen and a Christian witness to the uttermost part of the earth. The Pleasant Valley neighborhood, though a tiny dot on the map, was in fact singularly cosmopolitan. Early settlers had come from many eastern States, and some directly from England, the Netherlands and Germany. This diversity may have placed in this boy's mind the idea of the bigness of the world. Alfred was the son of Cornelius Howard, who was born in Michigan in 1841. His mother was Harriett Guilford. Alfred's paternal grandfather was of English lineage, arriving in Michigan from White Plains, New York. His paternal grandmother was Margaret Osterhut of Dutch descent. Cornelius was deeply involved and powerfully loyal to the Church of the United Brethren in Christ. He was a frequent lay member to the St. Joseph Annual Conference, twice to the General Conference, and served for ten years as a Trustee of Otterbein College. Harriett Howard was likewise devoted, if unobtrusive in her religious expression. As a boy Alfred was uplifted by the sound of his mother's voice raised in prayer as she went about her housework. Boyhood and early education Alfred's favorite reading in boyhood was the Youth's Companion, a weekly magazine for young people, filled with hair-raising tales of Indian fights on the frontier. As a man Alfred expressed regret that those exciting stories always assumed the Indians had no rights on the land where they were reared and on which their ancestors had lived for generations. Alfred attended country school, then the Schoolcraft High School, four miles from his home. His favorite high school subject was physical geography. He also enjoyed physiology, which prompted in him for many years the desire to study medicine. At the age of eighteen he taught school one year in his neighborhood. The next year he taught near Davenport, Nebraska. Young Alfred was often encouraged to attend college. One of his encouragers was his pastor, the Rev. J. L. Parks. Thus, it was decided that Alfred should attend Roanoke Classical Seminary in Indiana. The Principal was Professor D. N. Howe, a graduate of Otterbein and of the Union Biblical Seminary in Dayton, Ohio (now United Theological Seminary). Alfred enjoyed these college preparatory studies under Professor Howe. After this one year, however, because the Roanoke Seminary moved to North Manchester, Indiana, Alfred decided to attend Otterbein in Westerville, Ohio. College The autumn of 1889 found Alfred Howard, at the age of twenty-one, enrolled in the academy of Otterbein College. One year later he matriculated to the college itself. His days at Otterbein were happy ones, and he never tired in later years of relating his college memories. Alfred was an earnest student, with a mind thirsty for truth, a characteristic he retained the rest of his life. Nevertheless, bad eyesight severely handicapped him, and he had great difficulty getting glasses which fit properly. Heredity and an active farm upbringing gave Alfred a powerful physique. In college, he played varsity football, alternating between center and guard. Frequently he was pivot man in the famous \\"flying wedge.\\" Music Alfred sang first tenor in the Otterbein Quartet, the first of a series of such organizations in the history of the college. On one occasion the quartet sang at the church of W. W. Williamson, who had a son John. The latter was fascinated by the singing collegians and vowed to also some day go to Otterbein and sing in the quartet. In due time John Finley Williamson did both, and much more than that. He continued his musical interests after graduation, organizing a choir and a choir school: founding the Westminster Choir College in Dayton, Ohio, (presently in Princeton, New Jersey), which became world famous. One year Alfred directed the Presbyterian Church choir in Marion, Ohio, traveling from Otterbein each weekend. The pastor was a Rev. Mr. Thomas, whose young son Norman became well acquainted with Alfred. Later Norman Thomas also became a Presbyterian minister, but is better known as the frequent candidate for President of the United States on the Socialist ticket. Y.M.C.A. The Young Men's Christian Association on the Otterbein campus made a rich contribution to Alfred Howard's life. S. D. Gordon was state secretary of college Y.M.C.A. work in Ohio at that time, and John R. Mott and Robert E. Speer, young men just out of Cornell and Princeton, respectively, were frequent speakers at Y.M.C.A. conferences. In 1890 at one such conference John R. Mott made an address which engraved three unforgotten sentences on young Howard's mind: :Hide the Word of God in your Heart (Bible Study) :Tie yourself to one man (personal evangelism) :Keep your eyes fixed on the uttermost part of the earth (foreign missions). One summer Alfred even attended the famous college Y.M.C.A. conference at Northfield, Massachusetts. Marriage Howard met May Day Stevenson at Otterbein. They conducted their courtship on the campus, but he proposed to her one summer by letter. Alfred and May were married on their graduation day: 15 June 1894, in the home of Professor Henry Garst, who performed the ceremony in the presence of many college friends. Soon thereafter the happy couple were on the high seas sailing for the mission field in Africa. Call to missionary service Alfred Taylor Howard was deeply religious. He believed profoundly in the efficacy of prayer. As a boy he had formed the habit of prayer, and as a college student prayed regularly. In later life, while taking long walks, he would pray for long lists of persons and causes, setting aside certain days of the week for various portions of his long prayer lists. Toward the end of his college days, Alfred wondered about what his life-work should be. So he made this a matter for prayer. During the summer before his senior year, while working on his father's farm, he chose a certain empty stall in the barn as his \\"quiet place\\" for daily intercession. Later he wrote, \\"I do not know when in my life I ever prayed more earnestly for definite guidance.\\" In his handwritten memoirs, found after his death, he tells of the outcome of his prayer: :\\"One day early in August, Dr. William M. Bell, an old friend of father's, was to speak at a county Sunday school convention in Kalamazoo. Doctor Bell had been elected general secretary of the Home, Frontier and Foreign Missionary Society of the United Brethren Church. My brother Roy and I drove to Kalamazoo to hear him. We saw him for just a few minutes before his address to the convention. He said he wished to see me after the meeting. Accordingly at the close of the program he came through the crowd toward me, and to my surprise, stated, \\"Howard, we want you to go to Africa.\\"'' See also *List of bishops of the United Methodist Church References * Milhouse, Paul W., Nineteen Bishops of the Evangelical United Brethren Church, Nashville, The Parthenon Press, 1974. * Koontz, Paul Rodes, and Roush, Walter Edwin, The Bishops: Church of the United Brethren in Christ, Dayton, Ohio: The Otterbein Press, 1950.

He took over control of Lúlóng Circuit (盧龍, headquartered in modern Beijing) in 810 after killing his father Liú Jì () as well as his brother Liú Gǔn (), and thereafter ruled the circuit de facto independently from the imperial government. In 821, he submitted the circuit to imperial control and took tonsure to be a Buddhist monk. He died shortly after.  Background  It is not known when Liu Zong was born. He was the second son of Liu Ji,Old Book of Tang, vol. 143 who ruled Lulong Circuit as its military governor (Jiedushi) starting in 785 (when he succeeded Liu Zong's grandfather Liu Peng).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 232. Liu Zong's older brother Liu Gun was considered Liu Ji's heir, and during Liu Ji's rule was made deputy military governor, then considered the post for the heir among warlords who controlled their circuits de facto independently from the imperial government.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 237.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 238. Liu Zong was made the prefect of Ying Prefecture (瀛州, in modern Cangzhou, Hebei). Liu Zong was described by the Old Book of Tang to be treacherous.  Killing of father and brother  In 810, Liu Ji was commanding his Lulong troops in attacking Wang Chengzong, the ruler of neighboring Chengde Circuit (成德, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), whom Emperor Xianzong had declared a renegade. He had Liu Gun remain at Lulong's capital You Prefecture () to serve as acting military governor, while Liu Zong accompanied him on the campaign, serving as the army commander. During the campaign against Wang, Liu Ji had Liu Zong command the siege of Anping (安平, in modern Hengshui, Hebei), and Anping fell in one day. However, the Lulong army became bogged down at Raoyang (饒陽, in modern Hengshui) and was not able to advance further.New Book of Tang, vol. 212 Meanwhile, Liu Ji grew ill during the campaign. Liu Zong conspired with Liu Ji's assistant Zhang Qi (), treasurer Cheng Guobao (), and other officers, to take over power. He had people pretend to be imperial messengers arrive at the Lulong army's camp to state, \\"As the imperial government sees that you, Lord Chancellor,At that time, Liu Ji carried an honorary chancellor title. refuse to advance any further, the Deputy Military Governor has been made military governor.\\" The next day, he had another person state, \\"The Deputy Military Governor's banner has already arrived at Taiyuan.\\" Later on, he had another person state, \\"The banner has gone past Dai Prefecture [(代州, in modern Xinzhou, Shanxi)].\\" The army was shocked by these developments. Liu Ji himself was shocked and incensed, and he killed tens of officers who were friendly with Liu Gun. He also sent messengers to You Prefecture, ordering Liu Gun to report to the Lulong army's camp, while making Zhang Qi's brother Zhang Gao () take over the headquarters. It was said that due to his anger, Liu Ji did not eat on that day from morning to noon, and when he grew thirsty and asked for a drink, Liu Zong handed him a poisoned drink. On August 20, 810, Liu Ji died from the poison. At Liu Gun travelled from You Prefecture to Zhuo Prefecture (涿州, in modern Baoding, Hebei), Liu Zong issued an order in Liu Ji's name, ordering that Liu Gun be caned to death. Liu Zong then took over the control of the circuit. As the imperial government did not know all that had occurred, Liu Zong was made military governor. He was also created the Duke of Chu.  As military governor  In 816, as Emperor Xianzong waged another campaign against Wang Chengzong, Liu Zong mobilized his troops and captured Chengde's town Wuqiang (武強, in modern Hengshui). He also put Leshou (樂壽, in modern Cangzhou) under siege.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 239. In response, Emperor Xianzong gave him the honorary chancellor title of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (). However, it was said that Liu then effective sat on the fence and did not advance further, and as the regulations at the time were that once a circuit's army advanced out of its borders on an imperially-sanctioned campaign, the imperial treasury would be responsible for its expenses, the Lulong army's supplies were costly to the imperial treasury. With the other armies against Chengde also not making much advances, in 817, Emperor Xianzong abandoned the campaign against Chengde and ordered the circuits' armies to return to their own circuits.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 240. In 817, Wang's ally Wu Yuanji, who ruled Zhangyi Circuit (彰義, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan), was defeated and captured by the imperial general Li Su. In fear, Wang submitted to imperial authority and surrendered two of his six prefectures to imperial control. In the aftermaths of Wang's actions, Liu's officer Tan Zhong () persuaded him to also submit to imperial authority.  Resignation and death  Meanwhile, it was said that Liu Zong, after he had killed his father and brother, had often been fearful in his heart, and at times he saw his father and brother in his dreams. He often gave food to several hundred Buddhist monks at his headquarters and had them hold religious ceremonies, and after he finished his day of work he would retreat to a room near the ceremonies. If he did not, then he would not be able to sleep. Seeing that the other circuits had all submitted to imperial authority, in 821 (when Emperor Xianzong's son Emperor Muzong was emperor), he requested to resign and become a Buddhist monk himself. He also requested an award to the soldiers, while ordering a number of officers that he felt were difficult to control, including Zhu Kerong (the grandson of a former military governor, Zhu Tao) to report to Chang'an, hoping that the imperial government would give them proper discipline and rewards such that they would become faithful to the imperial government. He further recommended that Lulong be divided into three circuits and recommended Zhang Hongjing, Xue Ping, and Lu Shimei () to take over the three circuits.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 241. In response to Liu's proposal, Emperor Muzong gave a number of Liu's relatives honored titles, issued a money reward to the Lulong soldiers, and further issued two alternative edicts — one bestowing the dharma name of Dajue on Liu Zong, granting him a temple named Bao'en Temple (), and giving him special purple monk robes; and one making him the military governor of Tianping Circuit (天平, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong) and giving him the honorary chancellor title of Shizhong (). He had his eunuchs deliver the two edicts to Liu Zong, to let Liu Zong decide which edict he would accept. However, before the edicts could arrive at You Prefecture, Liu Zong took tonsure and became a monk, and he prepared to depart You Prefecture. Some soldiers refused to let him leave, and he executed some 10 of the leaders and gave his seals to Zhang Qi, making Zhang the acting military governor. He then left in the middle of the night, and only in the morning did the soldiers find out. Zhang submitted a report stating, \\"I do not know where Liu Zong is by this point.\\" On May 2, Liu Zong, who was by then in Ding Prefecture (定州, in modern Baoding), died.

It has been noticed in the recent past that sometimes girls' academic performance is better than boys and a number of girls are pursuing higher education. A fact worth mentioning is that few families have moved to nearby town just for their daughter's higher education as there is no degree college in the vicinity. There is One B.A.M.S College has opened in this village and people come from outside to complete their study .Which is very good news about the village and its people.

There are various shops on the road market such tailor, salons, confectionery, medical stores, grocery and stationery, puncture fixing, cycle/scooter/motor cycle repairing, STD booths, carpenter, flour mill, electronics gadgets repairing etc. This small market also serves the needs of other nearby villages.  Sources of income  The main source of income for majority of people if agriculture. The main crops are sugar-cane, wheat and paddy analog with cash crops. The water from canal is a main source of irrigation. The well known Upper Ganga Canal passes through the village periphery. There are couple of tube wells as well. In case of shortage of canal's water or electricity, sometimes the farmers are compelled to use ground water pumped using diesel engines which becomes a very costly affair. The village low income population is also dependent on the industries around the village like potteries, dairy and iron rods fabrication factory. The figure of government employees in the village is not very encouraging. There are few village people who have got employment in private sector. In the search of employment, the village people migrate to nearby towns and New Delhi.

The bridge is one of two crossings of Middle Harbour, the other being the Spit Bridge.  Current bridge  The suburbs east of Middle Harbour grew rapidly in the years following the opening of the inaugural Roseville Bridge. On 2 April 1966 the Liberal Premier Robin Askin, the Member for Collaroy at the time, later the Member for Pittwater, opened the current six-lane, high-level bridge. Along with the bridge, a significant upgrade of the approach roads was completed, which became the six-lane Warringah Road. This upgraded section of road is approximately long. Built at a cost of 4.4 million, the bridge is long has a clearance of from the water below. However, the adjacent Pipe Bridge has a clearance of only . This limitation, combined with only depth of water, make it out of reach for most cruising vessels. Today Roseville Bridge is part of a major thoroughfare from the Pacific Highway at Roseville to the Northern Beaches and suburbs east of Middle Harbour. Due to the halt of the construction of the Warringah Expressway across Middle Harbour to Wakehurst Parkway and the Burnt Bridge Creek Deviation, which is the only part of the Warringah Expressway built on the Northern Beaches by the Labor Wran government, there are today only two other major roads to these areas: Mona Vale Road, and Spit Road which crosses Middle Harbour downstream from Roseville Bridge using the Spit Bridge. The road carries three lanes of traffic towards Roseville, and three lanes of traffic towards . A grade- separated shared pedestrian footpath and cycleway is located on the western side of the bridge. Former Roseville Bridge, 1924-1974  An original bridge across Middle Harbour at Roseville was built jointly by the Willoughby, Ku- ring-gai and Warringah councils; with fifty percent of the funding provided by the NSW Government. It was built of reinforced concrete by unemployed returned servicemen and opened on 20 September 1924. It was claimed to be the longest bridge of that type in NSW although the bridge across the Hawkesbury River at was longer. It was claimed to be the first bridge supported on reinforced concrete piles. This low-level two-lane bridge was located downstream of the current bridge, and connected Babbage Road to what is today called Healey Way, which is the entrance to Davidson Park within Garigal National Park. The first bridge replaced an earlier ferry service consisting of rowing boats across the narrowest section of water. The 1924 bridge survived the opening of the new bridge, and provided pedestrian access only, until it was demolished in 1974, along with Roseville Baths. Almost nothing remains from these structures.

They can vary in colour and form significantly based on their altitude. They also show an adaptation to high altitudes called altitudinal melanism. They show dark bodies and darkened colouration at the wingbase which helps them warm faster using the sun. Although classified under the swallowtail butterfly family, none of the Parnassius species possesses tails. The larvae feed on species of plants belonging to the Papaveraceae and Crassulaceae families, and like the other swallowtail butterfly larvae, possess an osmeterium.Katoh, T.; Chichvarkhin, A.; Yagi, T. & Omoto, K.

Zoological Science. 22 (3): 343-51. Unlike most butterflies that have exposed pupae, they pupate inside a loose silken cocoon. Identification and ecology Species differences in female genitalia Sphragis (mating plug) in female Parnassius apollo Parnassius species of butterflies are often hard to identify and can sometimes only be identified by dissection of the genitalia.Ackery, P. R. (1975). \\"A guide to the genera and species of Parnassiinae (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae)\\". Bulletin of the British Museum (Natural History) Entomology. 31 (4) The phylogeny of the group is still under study using molecular techniques. The exact number of species within the genus is disputed and numbers range from 38 to 47.Nazari, Vazrick (2006). \\"Parnassius Latreille, 1804\\". Version 7 July 2006 (under construction). Tree of Life Web Project. Shows cladogram The Parnassius butterflies also have a peculiar reproductive strategy in that the male has special accessory glands that produce a mating plug that seals the female genitalia after mating. This is believed to ensure the success of the male and to prevent other males from mating and avoids sperm competition.Ehrlich, A. H. & Ehrlich, P. R. (1978). \\"Reproductive strategies in the butterflies: I. Mating frequency, plugging, and egg number\\". Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society. 51: 666-697. Butterflies of this genus have been widely used models to study metapopulations, population genetics and gene flow. Their patchy distribution and restricted migration makes them vulnerable to the effects of genetic drift and considerable colour variations can exist in individuals from different regions.Dechaine, Eric G. & Martin, Andrew P.

Secondly that the earliest split within the genus Parnassius is between subgenus Parnassius (the 'apollo' group, whose caterpillars feed on Crassulaceae, exceptionally Saxifragaceae) and the ancestor of the remaining seven subgenera. The existence of the subgenera is confirmed by molecular phylogenies. Six of the other subgenera have Fumariaceae as the larval food plant, while the larvae of the remaining genus Kreizbergia feed on ScrophulariaceaeMichel, F.; Rebourg, C.; Cosson, E. & Descimon, H.

The complete story became popular in Taiwan, attracting a publisher and being released in print. Plot summary The protagonist (who shares the same name as the author) meets and falls in love with a girl, FlyNDance, on the Internet. They eventually meet up in real life and become a couple, going out by day and chatting online by night. After some time together, however, FlyNDance is diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (erroneously translated as erysipelas in the English translation), which symbolically causes a butterfly- shaped rash to appear on her face. The disease proves to be fatal and the novel ends with the protagonist finding and reading a letter FlyNDance had written for him before she died.

Activity The majority of the committee's activity takes place in its subcommittees, while the committee as a whole largely serves as a media stage for top defense decision makers. The committee approves extensive subcommittee-drafted delegated legislation in areas of defense, emergency preparedness, emergency recruitment of human resources, Shabak special operations, allocation of emergency equipment, the deployment of the Home Front, and other security and intelligence related tasks. The committee is presented with summaries by the top decision makers in areas of foreign affairs, defense, and intelligence, including by the Prime Minister, the Foreign Affairs Minister, the Minister of Defense, and the heads of Mossad, Shabak, and Aman. The committee's chair, who reports on much of the country's defense activities, is considered one of the most senior figures in the Security Forces and subsequently, it is one of the most sought after positions in the Knesset.

In People Like Us, Luyendijk tells the story of his five years as a correspondent in the Middle East. He chronicles first- hand experiences of dictatorship, occupation, terror, and war. His stories cast light on a number of major crises, from the Iraq War to the Israeli- Palestinian conflict, along with less-reported issues such as underage orphan trash-collectors in Cairo. The more he witnessed, the less he understood, and he became increasingly aware of the yawning gap between what he saw on the ground and what was later reported in the media.

It is significant for its Victorian viaduct, which crosses the Colne valley.  Name and history  The present name of Chappel derives from the construction of a small chapel of ease, noted in 1285 AD as standing at the northern boundary of the parish of Great Tey. During the 16th century, because of concerns from Chappel residents about the distance to Great Tey's own church at festival time, this area was split from the parish and become a separate entity known as Pontisbright (lit. \\"Britric's bridge\\") that would eventually become known as Chappel. In 1433, the vicar of Great Tey agreed that the inhabitants of Chappel could find and elect their own chaplain. The benefice itself was united with that of the neighbouring village of Wakes Colne in 1938. The chapel itself, now the parish church of St Barnabas, is a grade I listed building. Chappel Viaduct Chappel's Victorian railway viaduct. The Chappel viaduct was built between 1847 and 1849 for the Colchester and Stour extension of the Eastern Counties Railway. Originally planned to be a timber structure, the viaduct was built of locally made brick because of the additional cost of maintaining a timber structure. Approximately 600 men were involved in the construction, most of whom were local East Anglians. The cost of construction was approximately £21,000 (approximately £2.2 million in 2016 money). The viaduct consists of 32 arches of span, with a total length of , and a maximum height of . The piers consist of two shafts, separated by a opening, and joined at top and bottom by arches; each shaft contain a hollow void by maximum, partially filled with concrete to the level of the bottom arch. The running level of the viaduct has a gradient of 1 in 120 The viaduct became a listed monument in 1967, and is thought to be the second-largest brick-built structure in England after Battersea Power Station. During the commemoration events to mark 50 years since the end of the Second World War, Chappel's beacon was transported by rail to a point on the viaduct where it could be seen from the playing field below, and lit after a ceremonial silence, the beginning and end of which were marked by the release of two maroons. The first passenger train to Sudbury, carrying an official party from Colchester, ran on 2 July 1849. The viaduct currently carries the Marks Tey to Sudbury branch railway (Gainsborough Line), which connects regularly with trains to and from London's Liverpool Street Station. Amenities The village has a pub dating from the 13th century, a parish church, a United Reformed church, a post office and general store, village hall and a railway station, Chappel and Wakes Colne station, which houses the East Anglian Railway Museum. It also has a children's play area which was upgraded in 2007-08 by Chappel Parish Council. In celebration of the millennium, the Chappel Millennium Green was opened. The Millennium Green has two areas: a nature reserve with board walk and a mown grass area for general recreation isbordered by a gravel path. It has also hosted several events, including the burning of a beacon and Colne Valley Festival events.  Village sign  Chappel's village sign depicts a bridge crossing a river, symbolic of the old bridge, dating from 1140 AD, which crossed the river Colne and connected the two halves of the estate of Crepping Manor. The lord of the manor was, at that time, responsible for its upkeep.

One of the important milestones in the Pope's efforts included a religious and peaceful initiative called A Common Word. This was provoked by an ill-conceived 2006 lecture he delivered at a university in Regensburg, Germany, which prompted Muslim leaders to gather and make overtures to their Christian and Jewish counterparts. Later on, Pope Benedict pursued key initiatives that helped foster Christian and Muslim dialogue. These were founded on the Pope's belief that Christians and Muslims have shared religious experience and that Christianity and Islam are both theologically founded in \\"God's irruptive call ... heard in the midst of man's ordinary daily existence.\\" Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy The Pope strongly condemned the Mohammed cartoons, first published by a Danish newspaper and later in other European papers, saying \\"In the international context we are living at present, the Catholic Church continues convinced that, to foster peace and understanding between peoples and men, it is necessary and urgent that religions and their symbols be respected.\\" He also added that this implies that \\"believers [of various religions] not be the object of provocations that wound their lives and religious sentiments.\\" Pope Benedict XVI noted that \\"for believers, as for all people of good will, the only path that can lead to peace and fraternity is respect for the convictions and religious practices of others.\\" Immigration Pope Benedict XVI has called for Christians as \\"to open their arms and hearts\\" to Muslim immigrants and \\"to dialogue\\" with them on religious issues. The Pope told participants that the Catholic Church is \\"increasingly aware\\" that \\"interreligious dialogue is a part of its commitment to the service of humanity in the modern world.\\" In fact, this \\"conviction\\" has become \\"the daily bread\\" of those who work with migrants, refugees and itinerant peoples, he said. Pope Benedict described this dialogue between Christians and Muslims as \\"important and delicate\\". Many communities have experienced this, he said, as they worked \\"to build relations of mutual knowledge and respect with (Muslim) immigrants, which are extremely useful in overcoming prejudices and closed minds\\". For this reason, he added, Christians \\"are called to open their arms and hearts to everyone, whatever their country of origin, leaving the task of formulating appropriate laws for the promotion of healthy existence to the authorities responsible for public life\\".Open arms to Muslim immigrants On September 11, 2006, the leaders of Muslim communities in Italy endorsed statements by Pope Benedict XVI who warned that Africa and Asia feel threatened by the West's materialism and secularism. \\"We agree with the Pope,\\" said Roberto Piccardo, the spokesman of Italy's largest Muslim group UCOII. \\"It is true that Muslims are puzzled by a West which is hostage to a materialistic system.\\" Mario Scialoja, the former president of the World Muslim League, also expressed support for the pope's words, saying that the \\"West's exclusion of God leads to the wrong life models.\\"ITALIAN MUSLIMS ENDORSE POPE'S CRITICISM OF WEST On October 21 the Vatican for the first time released a document in Arabic, a speech of the Vatican UNESCO representative which addresses scientific and ethical issues.Vatican releases document in Arabic The next day the Pope sent his \\"cordial greetings\\" to Muslims as they celebrated the ending of the holy month of Ramadan. \\"I am happy to send cordial greetings to Muslims around the world who are these days celebrating the end of the Ramadan fasting month\\", said the Pope at the Vatican.\\"I send them all my wishes for serenity and peace\\", he added.Pope Benedict XVI sends 'cordial greetings' to Muslims The October 2006 edition of La Civiltà Cattolica – the authoritative magazine of the Rome Jesuits printed with the supervision and authorization of the Vatican authorities – opened with an editorial on Islam that furnished a very detailed and alarming description of fundamentalist and terrorist Islam, behind which “there are great and powerful Islamic states”: an Islam aiming at the conquest of the world and fostered by violence “for the cause of Allah\\". But it does this without even the slightest note of criticism of this nexus of violence and faith. And it is as if this nexus were an inescapable reality, against which the West and the Church should do little or nothing: little at the practical level – it’s enough to look over the scant measures against terrorism that are recommended – and nothing at the theoretical level. For its part, the editorial seems to say that Islam is the way it is and must be accepted as such. On November 10, 2006, Pope Benedict urged his fellow German Catholics to discuss their faith in Jesus Christ openly with the Muslims living there. The Pontiff said the Roman Catholic Church viewed Muslims \\"with respect and good will. They mostly hold on to their religious convictions and rites with great seriousness and have a right to see our humble and strong witness for Jesus Christ\\", he said after noting that modern German society had been largely secularized. \\"To do this convincingly, we need to make serious efforts. So wherever there are many Muslims, there should be Catholics with sufficient knowledge of languages and Church history to enable them to talk with Muslims.\\"Pope urges German Catholics to talk with Muslims The same month the Pope received in audience an Algerian Muslim philosopher known for his commitment to battling religious hatred. \\"I was impressed by his welcome and attention, face to face,\\" Mustapha Cherif, an expert on Islam at the University of Algiers, told the Zenit News Service.Muslim philosopher, Pope Benedict hold dialogue The Pope said dialogue among Christians, Muslims and Jews was vital and urged Christians in the Middle East not to abandon the region. \\"Inter-religious and inter-cultural dialogue is not just an option, but a vital necessity for our times\\", he told members of a foundation on inter-religious dialogue. Christians needed to find \\"the ties that unite\\" them with the world's other two great monotheistic religions. Cardinal Secretary of State Tarcisio Bertone said in an interview in an Italian newspaper that the Pontifical Council for Inter-Religious Dialogue, which specializes in relations with Muslims, would be made a separate office and no longer merged with the Vatican's cultural office.Pope Restoring Vatican's Muslim Office Concerning the war in Iraq The head of the Vatican's Pontifical Council for Interfaith Dialogue said on March 26, 2006 that the war in Iraq should not be viewed as a \\"crusade\\" launched by Christian countries against Muslims, and that \\"Western\\" was not synonymous to \\"Christian\\". \\"Pope Benedict XVI, like his predecessor John Paul II, never ceases to say this and show it by his acts, such as opposition to armed intervention in Iraq.\\" He said that the church is not \\"western\\", but \\"catholic\\". Pope Benedict XVI condemned pre-emptive war. It was the Pope's view that the invasion of Iraq \\"has no moral justification\\". As a cardinal, Benedict was critical about President George W. Bush's choice of sending an army into the heart of Islam to impose democracy. \\"The damage would be greater than the values one hopes to save\\", he concluded. He also said that \\"The concept of preventive war does not appear in The Catechism of the Catholic Church.\\"Condemnation of preventive war The Vatican condemned the execution of Saddam Hussein as a \\"tragic\\" event and warned that it risked fomenting a spirit of vendetta and sowing fresh violence in Iraq. \\"A capital punishment is always tragic news, a reason for sadness, even if it deals with a person who was guilty of grave crimes,\\" said Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi. \\"The position of the Church (against capital punishment) has been restated often\\", he said. \\"The killing of the guilty party is not the way to reconstruct justice and reconcile society. On the contrary, there is a risk that it will feed a spirit of vendetta and sow new violence\\", he said.Vatican calls Saddam execution 'tragic' At Easter, Pope Benedict XVI lamented the continual slaughter in Iraq and unrest in Afghanistan as he denounced violence in the name of religion. \\"Afghanistan is marked by growing unrest and instability, Benedict said. \\"In the Middle East, besides some signs of hope in the dialogue between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, unfortunately, nothing positive comes from Iraq, torn apart by continual slaughter as the civil population flees.\\"Pope Mourns Iraq's 'Continual Slaughter' Concerning Iran Pope Benedict XVI, in his first Easter message on April 16, 2006, called for a peaceful solution in the nuclear standoff with Iran, saying, \\"Concerning the international crises linked to nuclear power, may an honorable solution be found for all parties through serious and honest negotiations.\\" Tony Blair was granted a private audience with the Pope in June at the Vatican at the end of a week-long trip to Italy. The Pope told the Prime Minister to pursue diplomatic solutions to problems with states in the Middle East, including Iran. A Vatican spokesman said: \\"The Pope did stress that diplomacy and not conflict was the best way forward\\". The two leaders also discussed how \\"moderate voices\\" from the world's main religions need to work together to tackle extremism and reduce the risk of terrorism.Pope warns Blair against Iran attack German Chancellor Angela Merkel discussed the Middle East and Iran with Pope Benedict in a private audience in August 2006. She came out of her hour-long audience saying it was a “very impressive” experience. “We had a very intense exchange on world politics, especially on the Middle East, but also on how the international community should deal with Iran\\". Pope Benedict has been contacted by Iran’s President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as Tehran faces international isolation for its nuclear program.Merkel, Pope discuss Mideast situation The following month Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad expressed respect for Pope Benedict XVI and said the pontiff had \\"modified\\" his remarks that offended Muslims worldwide.\\"We respect the Pope and all those interested in peace and justice\\", Ahmadinejad told a news conference before departing for Venezuela. \\"I understand that he has modified the remarks he made.\\"Iranian President expresses 'respect' for Pope The Pope met Iran's Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki in December and called for dialogue to overcome conflicts, in an apparent reference to Tehran's standoff with the West over its atomic programme. The Vatican said in a statement that the Pope exchanged \\"warm wishes\\" with Mottaki.\\"The problems of people are always resolved through dialogue, mutual comprehension and in peace,\\" the Vatican said. Mottaki, during a private audience with the leader of the world's 1,000 million Roman Catholics, delivered a letter to the Pope from Ahmadinejad. \\"The message is completely non-political\\", Ehsan Jahandideh, a presidential office spokesman was quoted as saying by Iran's ISNA students news agency.\\"The president has emphasised in the message that cooperation of divine religions will help resolving problems of mankind\\", it said.Pope meets Iran's Mottaki, urges dialogue On May 4, 2007, former Iranian president Mohammad Khatami met Pope Benedict and said the wounds between Christians and Muslims were still \\"very deep\\", including those caused by a controversial papal speech last September. Khatami became one of the most prominent Muslim clerics to visit the Vatican since the Pope's controversial Regensburg speech which angered Muslims by appearing to link Islam and violence.The Vatican said Khatami and the Pope met for about 30 minutes and spoke through interpreters about the \\"dialogue among cultures\\" to overcome current tensions and promote peace. In talks that a spokesman called cordial, they also discussed the problems of minority Christians in Iran and the Middle East and encouraged peace efforts such as the conference on Iraq's future taking place in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt.Christian-Muslim wounds still \\"very deep\\": Khatami In December Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sent a Christmas message to the Pope saying that he hoped the Christian feast would \\"bring peace and tranquility, founded upon justice and spirituality, to the international community.\\" He told the Pontiff that he hoped the new year 2008 would bring \\"the elimination of oppression, of violence, and of discrimination.\\"Iranian leader sends Christmas greeting to Pontiff Concerning the Middle East conflict The Pope called for the establishment of a Palestinian state. He said: \\"May the international community, which re-affirms Israel's just right to exist in peace, assist the Palestinian people to overcome the precarious conditions in which they live and to build their future, moving towards the constitution of a state that is truly their own\\". The Pope received the first Bethlehem Passport from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the Vatican on December 3, 2005. The citation reads: > In that the bearer of this passport is a citizen of Bethlehem; that they > recognise this ancient city provides a light to the world, and to all people > who uphold the values of a just and open society; that they will remain a > true friend to Bethlehem through its imprisonment, and that they will strive > to keep the ideals of Bethlehem alive as long as the wall stands; we ask you > to respect the bearer of the passport and to let them pass freely. The passport is an initiative of the Open Bethlehem foundation, which was founded in November 2005 with the support of Bethlehem civil institutions and world figures including former USA President Jimmy Carter and Archbishop Desmond Tutu. On June 14, 2006, Pope Benedict XVI urged Israelis and Palestinians in his weekly general audience to return to negotiation after the \\"increasingly blind\\" tit-for-tat violence. The Vatican said in a statement that the pope felt close to the innocent victims of such violence and that the Holy Land had become \\"hostage to those who delude themselves they can solve the ever more dramatic problems of the region by force or unilateral action\\". The Vatican appealed to both sides \\"to show due respect for human life, especially that of unarmed civilians and children\\". In its statement, the Vatican urged the resumption \\"with courage of the path of negotiations, the only one that can lead to the just and lasting peace we all aspire to.\\" It also urged the international community to \\"rapidly activate\\" funds for humanitarian aid to Palestinians.Vatican: Pope urges Mideast talks Later that month the Pope called for 'serene and peaceful co-existence' in the Middle East. Referring to Eastern Catholic Churches in the Holy Land, the Pope said > \\"the serious difficulties it is going through because of profound > insecurity, lack of work, innumerable restrictions and consequent growing > poverty, are a cause of pain for us all... I invite pastors, faithful, and > everyone in positions of responsibility in the civil community, to favour > mutual respect between cultures and religions, and to create as soon as > possible the conditions for serene and peaceful coexistence throughout the > Middle East.\\"Pope calls for 'serene and peaceful coexistence' in Middle East On July 14, 2006, The Vatican condemned Israel's strikes on Lebanon, saying they were \\"an attack\\" on a sovereign nation. Cardinal Secretary of State Angelo Sodano said Pope Benedict and his aides were very worried that the developments in the Middle East risked degenerating into \\"a conflict with international repercussions.\\" \\"In particular, the Holy See deplores right now the attack on Lebanon, a free and sovereign nation, and assures its closeness to these people who already have suffered so much to defend their independence\\", he told Vatican Radio.Vatican condemns Israel for attacks on Lebanon Two days later the Pope prayed that God grant “the fundamental gift of harmony, bringing political leaders back on the path of reason and opening new possibilities for dialogue and understanding.” “In these days, the news from the Holy Land are all cause for new, grave worry, in particular, the widening of belligerent actions even in Lebanon, and for the numerous victims among the civilian population. At the origin of these merciless conflicts are, unfortunately, objective situations of violation of rights and of justice. But neither terrorist acts nor retaliation, above all when there are tragic consequences for the civilian population, can be justified, going down such roads – bitter experience has shown – does not bring positive results.\\"Pope urges talks in Lebanon conflict Later that month, Pope Benedict stated that he did not plan to intervene diplomatically in the Middle East fighting, but called on people of all religions to join Sunday's worldwide day of prayers for peace. \\"I think it is best to leave that to the diplomats, because we don't enter politics. But we do everything for peace. Our goal is simply peace, and we will do everything to help attain peace,\\" Benedict told reporters as he returned from an hour-long hike in the Italian Alps. The Pope has set aside Sunday as a worldwide day of prayers for peace, hoping the prayers will bring a halt to the fighting. Benedict invited everyone to pray, \\"especially Muslims and Jews.\\" Benedict said he had heard from Catholic communities in Lebanon and Israel, \\"...especially from Lebanon, who implored us, as they have implored the Italian government, to help. We will help with our prayers and with the people we have in ... in Lebanon\\".Pope calls for prayers for Mideast peace Pope Benedict XVI appealed on July 30, 2006 for an immediate cease-fire in the Middle East, hours after the deadliest attack in nearly three weeks of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. \\"In the name of God, I appeal to all those responsible for this spiral of violence, so that they immediately put down their arms on all sides. Immediately. I appeal to governing leaders and to international institutions not to spare any effort to obtain this necessary cessation of hostilities. In this moment I cannot help but think of the situation, ever more grave and more tragic, that the Middle East is going through: hundreds of dead, so many wounded, a huge number of the homeless and refugees, houses, cities and infrastructure destroyed. These facts demonstrate clearly that you cannot re-establish justice, create a new order and build authentic peace when you resort to instruments of violence\\".Pope Appeals for immediate Middle East Cease-Fire With the war in Lebanon, the Vatican's Middle East policies under Pope Benedict XVI came into clearer focus. Pope Benedict's pleas to stop the carnage, particularly after an Israeli air raid killed many civilians in Qana, echoed the dramatic appeals of Pope John Paul during times of Mideast conflict. In private talks, Vatican officials asked that the U.S. government use its influence with Israel to bring an immediate halt to hostilities. To the Israelis, the Vatican made it clear that it views its military offensive in Lebanon as a disproportionate use of force. On August 7, 2006, Pope Benedict XVI renewed his appeal for peace in the Middle East and said he was deeply disappointed that calls for an immediate cease-fire in Lebanon had been ignored. \\"Faced with the bitter fact that up to now the calls for an immediate cease-fire in that martyred region have been disregarded, I feel impelled to renew my pressing appeal to that effect, asking everyone to offer their real contribution to the construction of a just and lasting peace.\\" Pope Benedict donated two ambulances and emergency medical supplies to Caritas in Lebanon. \\"War is the worst solution for everyone,\\" he has said. \\"It brings nothing of good for anyone, not even for the apparent victors. We know this well in Europe, after the two world wars. What everyone needs is peace. There are moral forces ready to help people understand that the only solution is that we must live together\\". He said the Vatican's actions and his own appeals were designed to mobilize all the potential forces of peace.Pope disappointed about ignored peace calls Pope Benedict sent a special envoy to Lebanon to lead prayers for peace. The Pope has asked Roger Etchegaray, a French Cardinal who was often the late Pope John Paul's special envoy to trouble spots, \\"to transmit to the suffering population ... his spiritual proximity and real solidarity\\". While the French cardinal's mission is \\"essentially religious\\" to try to celebrate Mass on Sunday with the patriarch of Lebanon's Maronite church, the Vatican says he may also meet President Émile Lahoud and Prime Minister Fouad Siniora. Etchegaray, 83-year-old president of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, was sent by Pope John Paul to Iraq in early 2003 to meet Saddam Hussein and try to avert war.Pope to send special envoy to Lebanon The Pope encouraged Syria to use its influence to help resolve Middle East conflicts and counter terrorism. He told Syria's ambassador that he was heartened by the diplomat's assurances that Damascus is committed to \\"counter this growing threat to peace and stability. The world looks especially to countries with significant influence in the Middle East in the hopeful expectation of signs of progress toward the resolution of these long-standing conflicts\\", the Pope said. A U.N. General Assembly resolution in September demanded that Israel withdraw from the Golan Heights, which it annexed from Syria in 1967. \\"You have spoken of your government's concern over the annexation of the Golan Heights by Israel in 1967,\\" Benedict said, referring to a speech that was just delivered by the ambassador, Makram Obeid, as the envoy presented his credentials\\". Like many impartial observers, the Holy See believes that solutions are possible within the framework of international law through the implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions,\\" the pontiff said.Pope encourages Syria to use its influence in Middle East to help resolve conflicts The Pope met Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas in April 2007 for talks that focused on the situation in the Middle East, the Vatican said in a statement. \\"In particular an appreciation was expressed for the relaunch, also thanks to the efforts of the international community, of the peace process between Israelis and Palestinians,\\" the statement said. Benedict also discussed the \\"difficulty faced by Catholics\\" in the Palestinian territories and \\"the value of their contribution to that society,\\" it added.VATICAN: POPE BENEDICT XVI MEETS PALESTINIAN PRESIDENT Concerning the Islam controversy On September 12, 2006, while lecturing on \\"Faith, Reason and the University\\" at the University of Regensburg, where he was formerly a professor, Pope Benedict quoted the opinion of Byzantine Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos, \\"Show me just what Muhammad brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached\\". In the original German, Benedict XVI described this critical opinion of Manuel II as \\"addressed... with a startling brusqueness\\"Meeting with the representatives of science at the University of Regensburg (\\"in erstaunlich schroffer, uns überraschend schroffer Form\\"Treffen mit den Vertretern der Wissenschaften in der Aula Magna der Universität Regensburg ). The Pope later explained that the remark was meant to compare early Muslim teaching on religious freedom with the later teaching on jihad, and was cited as part of a larger theological assertion, that \\"reason and faith go hand in hand, and that the concept of a holy war is always unreasonable, and against the nature of God, Muslim or Christian\\" The quotation from this medieval text drew criticism from a number of individual governmental representatives and Muslim religious leaders, including Yusuf Al-Qaradawi, Hamza Yusuf, and Ali Bardakoğlu, the Director of Religious Affairs of Turkey, as well as the governments of Somalia and Pakistan and India's major political parties. Some critics claimed the Pope made a number of historical errors. The main one being that, although the Pope had said that verse 2:256 stating \\"There is no compulsion in religion...\\" was an early verse when Mohamed was powerless in Mecca, this verse was one of the latest verses to be added to the Quran in Medina at a time when the Muslim state was powerful thereby taking a lot of weight out of the Pope's statement.YouTube - Broadening the Scope of the Pope Others have noted a heavy reliance on analogia entis rather than analogia fidei, and to consider \\"faith as the common ground\\" in the approach to Islam.Perspectives: A Journal of Reformed Thought, November 2006 The Director of the Vatican press office, Federico Lombardi, explained the Pope's statement: \\"It was certainly not the intention of the Holy Father to undertake a comprehensive study of the jihad and of Muslim ideas on the subject, still less to offend the sensibilities of Muslim faithful. Quite the contrary, what emerges clearly from the Holy Father’s discourses is a warning, addressed to Western culture, to avoid 'the contempt for God and the cynicism that considers mockery of the sacred to be an exercise of freedom'\\".Pope's Islam comments condemned - CNN, 15 September 2006 There were public protests, including violent ones in the West Bank where two churches were firebombed, over his comments in various countries in the subsequent days.\\"Italian nun killed by Somali gunmen\\", CBC.\\"West Bank churches struck after pope remarks\\", NBC. There has been a death threat on the Pope since the lecture from a group linked to Al Qaeda.Death threat Pope Benedict expressed his regret for any offense his words had given: \\"The Holy Father is very sorry that some passages of his speech may have sounded offensive to the sensibilities of Muslim believers,\\" said Cardinal Secretary of State Tarcisio Bertone in a statement.Pope apologises to Muslims, Reuters, 16 September 2006Pope 'sincerely regrets' he offended Muslims, AP, 16 September 2006 According to CNN, the Vatican comments fell short of a literal apology. On September 17, 2006, from the balcony at his residence at Castel Gandolfo outside Rome, Pope Benedict publicly expressed that he was 'deeply sorry for the reactions in some countries' and stressed that the words which 'were considered offensive' were not his own, but were quoted from a medieval text, and that his speech was intended to act as an invitation to mutually respectful dialogue with Muslims, rather than an attempt to cause offense. A few days later the Pope held a meeting at his summer residence in Castel Gandolfo with approximately 20 Muslim diplomats. At this meeting the Pope Benedict expressed \\"total and profound respect for all Muslims\\". Among the ambassadors invited included Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Morocco, and many other nations and Islamic Groups. The following month Pope Benedict XVI took another step to placate anger in the Islamic world over his remarks on holy war, making additions to his original text affirming that a quotation from a 14th- century Byzantine emperor was not his personal opinion. The original said the emperor's remark was made \\"somewhat brusquely\\". In the new version, it says it was made with \\"a brusqueness that we find unacceptable.\\" Benedict added in a footnote: \\"In the Muslim world, this quotation has unfortunately been taken as an expression of my personal position, thus arousing understandable indignation. I hope that the reader of my text can see immediately that this sentence does not express my personal view of the Quran, for which I have the respect due to the holy book of a great religion.\\" He said he cited the text as part of an examination of the \\"relationship between faith and reason\\".Pope makes additions to text on Islam An open letterIslamica Magazine - Open Letter to His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI was sent to Pope Benedict XVI by 38 Muslim authorities (later extended to 100) express an acceptance for his apology over his remarks on Islam. The signatories to the letter declare that they accept the Pope's \\"personal expression of sorrow and assurance that the controversial quote did not reflect his personal opinion\\". Some of the clerics who signed the letter were Shaikh Habib Ali of the Tabah Institute in Abu Dhabi and Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad, the special adviser to Jordan's King Abdullah II. Others who signed the letter include the grand muftis of Egypt, Russia, Bosnia, Croatia, Kosovo and Metohija (Serbia), Turkey, Uzbekistan and Oman, as well as the Iranian Shiite cleric Ayatollah Mohammad Ali Taskhiri, and Professor Seyyed Hossein Nasr of George Washington University, Washington.Top clerics accept Pope's apology Concerning Turkey Pope Benedict XVI said his forthcoming visit to Turkey in 2006 was a sign of the friendship he held for the Turkish people. “As you all know I am leaving for Turkey on Tuesday,” the Pontiff said in his weekly Angelus prayer in Rome on the preceding Sunday. “Starting right now, I want to send a cordial greeting to the dear Turkish people, rich in history and culture. To these people and their representatives I express feelings of esteem and sincere friendship.”Visit of friendship to Turkey The Pope said he backed Turkey's bid to join the European Union, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said after meeting the pontiff upon his arrival in Ankara for his first visit to a Muslim country. The Pope told Erdoğan that while the Vatican seeks to stay out of politics it \\"desires Turkey's membership in the EU\\".Pope Benedict Backs Turkey's European Union Bid The Pope had reversed his earlier opposition to Turkey's efforts to join the EU, appearing to back the overwhelmingly Muslim country's hard-fought push towards membership at the start of his visit. The Pope expressed hope that Turkey would join the EU. A papal spokesman later clarified the remarks, saying the Pope had told the Turkish leader the Vatican did not have the power to intervene, but \\"viewed positively and encouraged\\" the process of Turkey's entry into the EU \\"on the basis of common values and principles\\". Mr Erdoğan said: “The most important message the Pope gave was toward Islam, reiterating his view of Islam as peaceful and affectionate.”Pope turns other cheek to Muslim Turkey Pope Benedict XVI visited one of Turkey's most famous mosques in what was seen as an attempt to mend relations with the Muslim community. During his tour of the Blue Mosque in Istanbul, accompanied by local art historian Dr. Sedat Bornovalı, the pontiff turned towards Mecca in a gesture of Muslim prayer, together with Prof. Dr. Mustafa Çağrıcı, Mufti of İstanbul. It marked only the second papal visit in history to a Muslim place of worship. Earlier, the Pope visited the nearby Hagia Sophia Museum - a site heavy with Christian and Muslim symbolism - drawing a large crowd of protesters.Pope makes Turkish mosque visit The Papal trip to Turkey was widely hailed as a success. The aim was to mend fences there and, as he was greeted on his return by Italian leader Romano Prodi, the pontiff appeared to have succeeded in this. Ilter Turan, a professor of political science in Istanbul, said: “Visiting the Blue Mosque and praying with the Muslims indicated that maybe he had not expressed himself carefully in his earlier conversations with students at Regensburg and certainly his gestures will go a long way to alleviate the initial scar that was left by his remarks”. The Pope also praised Islam as a peaceful faith and expressed support for Turkey's bid to join the EU.Turkey trip hailed as success for Pope Benedict The prayer in Istanbul’s Blue Mosque was “not initially planned but it turned out to be very meaningful”. It was a prayer to the “one Lord of heaven and earth, merciful father of all mankind”. Addressing today’s general audience, this was how Benedict XVI described his silent prayer on 30 November in Istanbul. The Pope “thanked divine Providence for this” and said: “May all believers identify themselves with the one God and bear witness to true brotherhood.” The Pontiff augured that Turkey “will be a bridge of friendship and collaboration between East and West” and he thanked the Turkish people “for the cordiality and sympathy” they showed him throughout his stay, when “he felt loved and understood”.Pope: In mosque I prayed to the one God for all mankind The Vatican considered Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's strong victory in the 2007 general election in Turkey \\"the best result for Europe and for the Christian churches.\\" In an interview published by Italian daily Corriere della Sera, Cardinal Sergio Sebastiani also invited the European Union to resume talks with Ankara on Turkey's entry to the bloc.Erdogan victory 'best result possible,' Vatican official says Somalia Pope Benedict XVI called for negotiations to end fighting in Somalia, Associated Press reported from the Vatican City. In a speech to diplomats recently on global issues, the Pontiff recalled an Italian nun who was slain in Somalia last September, who he said would inspire efforts to end conflict in the Horn of Africa, where an Islamist movement threatening to overthrow the Western-backed dictatorship of Somalia has been ousted. Benedict called on all sides to lay down their arms and negotiate.Pope Calls for Negotiations to End Somalia Fighting Sudan Pope Benedict XVI, meeting with Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir on 14 September 2007, voiced his \\"heartfelt hope\\" for the success of peace talks next month for the war-torn region of Darfur, the Vatican said. \\"It is the Holy See's heartfelt hope that these negotiations prove successful in order to put an end to the suffering and insecurity of those peoples,\\" the Vatican said in a statement. Saudi Arabia Pope Benedict XVI welcomed King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia to the Vatican on November 6, 2007, marking the first time that a Saudi king has officially held talks with the Pope. During their encounter, the two leaders discussed religious freedom, inter-religious and inter-cultural dialogue and the need to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Pope received King Abdullah warmly, grasping both his hands and leading him into his library where they spoke in Italian and Arabic for 30 minutes. The meeting was arranged for at the request of the king who was on a tour of Europe.Pope and Saudi king deal with issues “close to the heart” References External links * Pope Prays in Blue Mosque (Google video) * Pope Apologizes For Speech about Islam (Google video) * The pope and the Holocaust deniers Category:Pope Benedict XVI Category:Christian and Islamic interfaith dialogue ","title":"Pope Benedict XVI and Islam"},{"id":"7712548","text":"Nine ships of the French Navy have been named in honour of Abraham Duquesne: * , a 74-gun ship of the line * , a captured Russian 73-gun ship, used as a school ship * a 80-gun ship of the line * , a steam and sail ship of the line * an unprotected cruiser * Duquesne (1914), an unbuilt * , a heavy cruiser (1924–1955) * , a * A Barracuda-class submarine is scheduled to bear the name See also *, a 74-gun ship of the line, was started as Duquesne before being renamed.

Palóu made significant contributions to the Alta California and Baja California mission systems. Along with his mentor, Junípero Serra, Palóu worked to build numerous missions throughout Alta and Baja California, many structures of which still stand today. A member of the Franciscan Order, Palóu became \\"Presidente\\" of the missions in Baja California, and later of missions of Alta California. Palóu's work in the Spanish mission system spans from his early twenties to his death at the age of 66. According to biographer Herbert E. Bolton, \\"Fray Palóu was a diligent student, devout Christian, loyal disciple, tireless traveler, zealous missionary, firm defender of the faith, resourceful pioneer, successful mission builder, able administrator, and fair minded historian of California\\". Palóu is particularly noted for his pious biography of Serra and for his multi-volume early history of the Californias. Biography Francesc Palou was born in Palma, Majorca, where he joined the Franciscan Order. Together with Juníper Serra, he traveled to New Spain in 1740 and served as a missionary in the Sierra Gorda region of Querétaro. When the Jesuits were expelled from Baja California in 1768, the Franciscans under Serra were sent to replace them. Palóu was assigned to the mission of San Javier. The following year, Serra went north to find the new mission province of Alta California, and Palóu succeeded him as head of the Baja California missions. When the Dominicans took over the peninsular Baja California missions in 1773, Palóu, being Franciscan, moved on to Upper California, marking the geographical boundary between the two orders' fields. He assisted in the exploration of the site of San Francisco and administered Mission San Francisco de Asís. When Serra died, Palóu was briefly acting head of the Baja California missions, but soon returned to central Mexico. =Missionary travels= As a missionary of the Spanish colonization of the Americas, Palóu traveled and proselytized in the Spanish colonial empire. His extensive travels left him knowledgeable of world matters, and well-respected as a scholar. Coming from simple beginnings, Palóu was born in 1723 at Palma, on the Island of Majorca, and began religious work early in his life as he entered the Franciscan Order around the age of seventeen in 1739. After developing a mentor/student relationship with Junípero Serra, they both eagerly joined the Spanish mission system in Alta California. They, along with several other missionaries, reached Veracruz, New Spain in 1749. Palóu worked in New Spain for many in missions such as Sierra Gorda. He was later recalled, along with Serra, to work in the San Saba region of Texas. However, the biggest part of Palóu's journey would not begin until 1767, when he and fourteen other Franciscan friars were sent north to extend their efforts and replace many of the Jesuit missionaries who had been previously expelled from Spain. Much of Palóu's life would be spent in Alta California, and many of his notable endeavors occurred there as well. =Alta California missions= Palóu and the other friars reached Loreto in Lower California in the spring of 1768. Palou was given control of Mission San Francisco Javier. The following year, Junipero Serra left for Alta California to proceed with the further establishment of missions in that region. This left the office of \\"president\\" or superior of all missions in Lower California for Palóu to control until 1773. When the Lower Californian missions were turned over to the Dominican missionaries, Palóu was able to rejoin his brethren and mentor in Upper California. He first went to San Diego, then continued onwards to Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo (in present-day Carmel), which Serra had been using as his headquarters. Palóu greatly assisted in the placement of friars and recorded historical data, the only surviving account of some aspects of the early California missions. =Expeditionary travel and later career= In 1774, Palóu accompanied Captain Rivera's expedition to the Bay of San Francisco, and on December 4 planted the cross on a hill he named \\"Lobos\\" (wolves), which sits in clear view of the Golden Gate and Pacific Ocean. The name lives on as Lobos Creek, within the Presidio of San Francisco. The Rivera expedition returned to the Presidio of Monterey via the coastal route first explored by the Portolà expedition of 1769. At the north end of Monterey Bay, Rivera and Palóu inspected the area around today's Santa Cruz, described by friar Juan Crespí (who accompanied Portolà) and recommended by Crespí as a future mission site. Palóu agreed, and on December 9 selected a location where Mission Santa Cruz was later founded by Fermín Lasuén, in 1791.Rowland, Leon. Santa Cruz: The Early Years (1980), Palou returned to Lobos in 1776 with the De Anza expedition and, on June 28, offered up the first mass at the future site of Mission Dolores, which Palóu founded but a few weeks later. Palóu remained at the new mission until he was called to give his mentor and close friend, Junípero Serra, his last rites in 1784 at Mission San Carlos. With Serra's death, Palóu became the acting presidente of the Upper California missions until the formal appointment of Lasuén as successor to Serra. Palou remained at Mission San Carlos until failing health and old age led him to retire in 1785 to the missionary College of San Fernando de Mexico. He was elected guardian of the college and held this office until his death in Mexico, where he had completed his biography of Serra,Palóu's Life of Serra most of which he had written while still in California. Legacy Francisco Palóu played many key roles and offices vital to the establishment of several of the missions in California and many of those in Mexico. He compiled a standard history of the California missions from 1767 to 1784 in his \\"noticias\\" as a four-volume set. He also wrote of his teacher, Junípero Serra. Both works provide key information about early California and the missionary system established there.

Her full title as sovereign, \\"al- Sayyida al-Hurrat-ul\\" translates to \\"The noble lady who is free and independent, the woman sovereign who bows to no superior authority\\". As female sovereign, Asma bint Shihab has an almost unique position in history: though there were more female monarchs in the international Muslim world, Asma bint Shihab and Arwa al-Sulayhi were the only female monarchs in the Muslim Arab world to have had the khutba proclaimed in their name in the mosques as sovereigns. Life Asma bint Shihab married her cousin, Ali al-Sulayhi, sultan and founder of the Sulayhid dynasty. The marriage between Ali and Asma was reportedly a happy one, and Ali relied on her support on his way to power and participated in the sacrifices his religious faith placed upon him. =First reign= When Ali became king in 1047, he named her queen, malika, but not merely his consort, but his formally acknowledged co-ruler and political partner, who governed the realm of Yemen by his side. In recognition of this, her name was proclaimed alongside that of her spouse in the Khutba, the traditional privilege of a sovereign in a Muslim state: 'the khutba was proclaimed from the pulpits of the mosques of Yemen in her husband's name and in her name', after the Fatimid sovereign and her husband: 'May Allah prolong the days of al-Hurra the perfect, who manages the affairs of the faithful with care.' This was the first time ever in history when the name of a woman had been proclaimed in the khutba. Another almost unique occurrence was that queen Asma bint Shihab \\"attended councils with her face uncovered\\", that is to say unveiled. Muhammad al-Thawr described her: \\"She was one of the most famous women of her time and one of the most powerful. She was munificent. She was a poetess who composed verses. Among the praises given her husband al-Sulayhi by the poets was the fact that he had her for a wife ... . When he ascertained the perfection of her character, her husband entrusted the management of state business to her. He rarely made decisions that went against her advice and [...] regarded her with very great respect and never gave any other opinion precedence over hers.\\" In 1067, during the pilgrimage to Mecca, the Banu Najah clan under Sa'id Ibn Najah, the prince of Zabid, attacked the travel party of Ali and Asma, killed Ali and took Asma prisoner. She was sequestered in a secret prison in Zabid, and reportedly, the severed head of her spouse was planted on a pole visible from her cell. After a year's imprisonment, she managed to get a message through to her son and daughter-in-law in Sa'na, and her son stormed Zabid and freed her. =Second reign= Asma returned to her realm and assisted her son, Ahmad al-Mukkaram, and daughter-in-law, Arwa al- Sulayhi, with the management of the realm until she died. When she met her son al-Mukarram, she confirmed him as his father's successor, but when he was paralyzed shortly afterward, she retook control as the co-regent of the realm together with her daughter-in-law Arwa, who was to be her co-ruler in accordance with the will of her son, as he was himself unable to rule because of his condition. Legacy Queen Asma was sometime affectionally referred to as the Little Queen of Sheba, according to Muhammad al-Thawr, \\"Some poets, carried away by their admiration of Asma, went so far as to declaim that if the throne of the queen of Sheba had been magnificent, that of Asma was still more so.\\" This is somewhat remarkable, as the queen of Sheba belonged to the jahiliyya, the time before Islam, which was traditionally viewed as a negative one. Another name used both for her and her daughter-in-law and co-regent was malika hazima: malika means queen, and hazim was an epithet awarded people regarded to have shown the utmost wisdom and judgement in political affairs.

S. Infantry Regiment that fought in the Korean War. His court-martial for refusing to obey an order from the regiment's white commanding officer led to worldwide protests and increased attention to segregation and racism in the U.S. military. Background regarding race in the United States military By the early 1950s, various Executive Orders had been issued attempting to end segregation in the U.S. armed forces. They had been largely ineffectual. The 24th Infantry Regiment, which consisted entirely of black soldiers, was thrown into the forefront of the Korean fighting at the outset. Casualties in the 24th were extremely heavy, and replacements and supplies, including shoes, were slow in coming. Stories began to filter out through various black news sources of atrocities committed by white American officers against the black troops they were leading. At one point the U.S. Air Force bombed the 24th by mistake, resulting in serious casualties. On August 6, 1951, Colonel Arthur S. Champeny, a white man, was appointed the 24th's commanding officer and informed them he was going to change their reputation from \\"the frightened 24th to the fighting 24th.\\" Gilbert's case Leon Aaron Gilbert, Jr. was born in York, Pennsylvania on November 9, 1920, the eldest of two sons of a blacksmith who had also served in World War I. He was educated in local schools and enlisted in the U. S. Army at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania on August 16, 1940. He served with the 92d Division in Italy and was honorably discharged in 1946, then called up again as a reservist in 1947. He was thus a decorated veteran with a record of ten years' service in the Army.\\"Truman asked to bar death for officer,\\" New York Times, Sept 23, 1950, p.32 He and his wife Kay had two children with a third on the way. In the fall of 1950, Gilbert was in command of Company A of the 24th, having taken over when his commanding officer was wounded. He received an order to return with twelve of his men to a forward position. Gilbert's company had been forced to withdraw from that position after coming under heavy machine gun fire at close to point blank range, so to return to that position would have been tantamount to suicide.\\"Death Sentence Studied\\" New York Times, October 7, 1950, p.2 When Gilbert refused the order to return, he was arrested and tried on the spot.\\"Soldier Haunted By Korean War Conviction Dies\\" Gettysburg [Pa.] Times, April 5, 1999, p. A-3 Despite Gilbert's suffering from shock and fatigue due to prolonged heavy fighting (according to a letter to his wife, they had gone thirteen days without food or water), he was accused of insubordination and cowardice, and a court martial sentenced him to death. In an interview with the New York Times, Gilbert gave his version of the incident. > I did not refuse to obey the order. I was trying to explain why it couldn't > be carried out. There were twelve men in my command. Then I considered it my > duty as an officer to show why the order meant certain death.\\"Doomed officer > denies cowardice\\" New York Times, October 15, 1950, p.9 A storm of public protest erupted around the world in reaction to the sentencing; in the U.S., labor leaders, church leaders, and the American Legion became involved, and the National Negro Council collected 600,000 signatures on a petition for his pardon.\\"Pardon petitions pushed,\\" New York Times, Sept 5, 1951, p. 29 President Harry S. Truman commuted the sentence to 20 years' imprisonment at hard labor, dishonorable discharge, and forfeiture of all pay and pension allowances. In September 1952 the sentence was reduced to seventeen years for \\"battle misconduct.\\"\\"Army Cuts Sentence\\" New York Times, September 21, 1952, p.45 Gilbert served five years, the maximum penalty for disobedience under peacetime conditions (war was never officially declared in Korea), before he was released. Following the court-martialing of Lieutenant Gilbert, mass court-martialing of whole units of the 24th Regiment ensued, with no comparable action being taken against white units. Thurgood Marshall, general counsel of the NAACP, wrote \\"The letters we have received from convicted soldiers and the talks we have had with war correspondents strongly indicate that many of these men have been victimized by racial discrimination.... It seems apparent that some of them are being made scapegoats for the failures of higher personnel.\\"William T. Bowers, William M. Hammond, and George L. MacGarrigle: Black Soldier, White Army: The 24th Infantry Regiment in Korea (Washington: Center of Military History, United States Army, 1996) at pp. 186–187 In 1996, an official Army report noted that Gilbert's regiment performed poorly in the early years of the Korean War, as did many white units, but went on to say, \\"There was no single reason for what happened (to the 24th)...An aggressive enemy, old and worn equipment, inexperience at all levels, leadership failures high and low, casualties among key personnel and a lack of bonding and cohesion in some units all played their part. There was no lack of courage among the officers and men.\\"William T. Bowers, William M. Hammond, and George L. MacGarrigle: Black Soldier, White Army: The 24th Infantry Regiment in Korea (Washington: Center of Military History, United States Army, 1996) at p. 267 The incident scarred Gilbert for life. His father had died while he was in custody, and five years after he was released on parole, his wife divorced him. Gilbert returned to his hometown of York, Pennsylvania, remarried, and lived quietly until his death. Although he never stopped trying to clear his name, to little avail, his last years were cheered somewhat by the fact that his surviving comrades-in-arms had never forgotten him, and after they had located him, welcomed him back into their ranks. As one of them reported, \\"He didn't know if we would accept him. We welcomed him with open arms. No matter what was written, no matter what was said, we know the facts. We were there.\\" Notes References *Jim Crow Guide to the USA *New York Times, various articles 1950–1953 Category:1920 births Category:1999 deaths Category:People from York, Pennsylvania Category:History of racial segregation in the United States Category:African- American military personnel ","title":"Leon Gilbert"},{"id":"7712598","text":"Warren Eversleigh Preece (April 17, 1921 – April 11, 2007) was editor of Encyclopædia Britannica from 1964 to 1975, during the development of \\"Britannica 3\\" (the 15th edition).

Major applications included various Renault and Volvo vehicles. The name became synonymous in the U.S. with the computer and fuel injection system used on the AMC/Jeep 2.5 L I4 and 4.0 L I6 engines. Use of name The term Renix also has a number of applications. In certain carburetor equipped Renault and Volvo models, it provides an electronic ignition system, consisting of an engine control unit (ECU) to replace the job of contact breaker points in the distributor. The system uses an angle sensor and a number of fuel sensors to provide a maintenance-free ignition system. The ECU is sealed and cannot be serviced, and the EPROM cannot be re-programmed. Later, the name was synonymous with a form of fuel injection. In such an application, it consisted of an ECU and a number of sensors. It was first seen in engines produced by Renault (Renault 21, 25, and Espace) in and capacities. It is better known in America for its application in the AMC 4.0 L displacing straight-6 engines. Production began by American Motors (AMC) with the 1987 Jeep Cherokee (XJ) models. It was preceded by the AMC Computerized Engine Control, and followed by Chrysler's Mopar MPI system. Renix Electronique Renix Electronique S.A., was established in 1981 as a joint venture by Renault with 51% interest and Bendix with 49% that was headquartered in Toulouse. Renix Corporation of America was the North American subsidiary of Renix Electronique to provide sales, logistics, engineering, and quality support to American Motors. When Renault encountered financial troubles in 1985, it sold its interest in Renix to AlliedSignal, a major auto industry supplier and the new owner of Bendix. Renix Corporation of America was also absorbed by AlliedSignal Corporation when it purchased Renix Electronique from Renault. The US$200 million Allied buyout of Renault's 51% of Renix made it part of Bendix Electronics and Engine Controls. Renix products are produced in France and marketed worldwide under the Bendix brand name. In 1988, the French Bendix site was sold to Siemens VDO. In 2008, Siemens AG sold its VDO branch to Continental automotive group. Renault applications The Renix system was used in the J series engines as fitted to the Renault 19 16V, Renault 21 and Savanna/Nevada, the Renault 25, and the Renault Espace. It was a multi-point fuel injection system, as opposed to a single-point system, with a number of air, throttle and pinking sensors, and an advanced computer. Application of the system could first be seen in 1984, three years before its American debut. The Renix system pushed the power of the carburetor-fed engine from . It could also be found in 2.2 L engines fitted to R21, 25, and Espace models. The Renix fuel injection and a Garrett turbocharger was used in the mid-mounted V6 powering the Renault Alpine GTA/A610 sports car. AMC/Jeep applications AMC-Renault uses a fully integrated electronic engine control system made by Renix The Renix electronic ignition system consists of a solid-state Ignition Control Module (ICM), a distributor, a crankshaft position sensor, and an Electronic Control Unit (ECU). The Renix ECU has a powerful microprocessor that was advanced technology for its time. It also incorporates an engine knocking sensor that allows the computer to know if detonation is occurring, thus allowing the computer to make adaptive control by individual cylinder corrections to prevent pinging. The knock detection uses the signal from a wide band accelerometer mounted on the cylinder head. Good signal to noise ratio is obtained primarily through angular discrimination. The Renix system has more inputs than the later Mopar system and in some ways is more complex. Its knock sensor automatically tunes the spark advance curve to an optimum mix for each cylinder. Some Renix controlled engines will actually get better fuel economy using higher octane fuel. The system on the AMC 4.0 L is flexible allowing the use of a modified camshafts and modifications to the cylinder heads without significant changes to the base computer. The Renix computer was first used on 1986 AMC 2.5 L four-cylinder engines. The system improved the drivability of the Jeep Cherokee and Comanche over carbureted models. The power increase was also noticeable. The Renix system was used through the 1990 model year. Unfortunately, it is handicapped because few scan tools can be \\"plugged in\\" to this on-board diagnostics computer. The Renix control system prior to 1991 can be tested only with Chrysler's DRB tester, and the diagnostic test modes for 1989 and later engines with SBEC controllers differ from those provided for 1988 and earlier models. :Model years: :* 1986 - Renix TBI available on Jeep 2.5 L four-cylinder engines. :* 1987 - the new Renix controlled 4.0 L six-cylinder engine was rated at and of torque. :* 1988 - 4.0 L output increased to and of torque, due to higher compression ratio. :* 1989 - Changed to Renix MPFI. :* 1991 - Chrysler Corporation (then the owners of the Jeep brand replaced the Renix control system with OBD-I-compliant control electronics, the Chrysler HO EFI). The Renix control system was only found on the 1987-1990 Jeep Cherokee and Comanche with AMC-designed engines (the control setup used with the V6 was OBD-I General Motors, and the early Diesel was a Renault turbodiesel I4 that used its own specific control setup.) The Jeep Wrangler (YJ) did not get the AMC 4.0 engine until 1991, when it was accompanied by Chrysler-designed electronics as well. Until then, it retained the AMC engine with a carburetor. No other Jeep vehicle was equipped with Renix electronic controls. =Operation= In a typical Jeep application, the ignition control module (ICM) is located in engine compartment. It consists of a solid-state ignition circuit, as well as an integrated ignition coil that can be removed and serviced separately. Electronic signals from the ECU to the ICM determine the amount of ignition timing or retard needed to meet engine power requirements. The ECU provides an input signal to the ICM. The ICM has outputs for a tach signal to the tachometer and a high voltage signal from the coil to the distributor. The crankshaft position sensor senses TDC (Top Dead Center) and BDC crankshaft positions, as well as engine rpm. This sensor is secured by special shouldered bolts to flywheel/drive plate housing and is not adjustable. =Inspection stations= The Renix control system is \\"pre-OBD\\" and therefore does not have a \\"Check Engine Lamp\\". It also does not \\"store\\" or \\"throw\\" Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) or \\"Parameter IDs\\" (PIDs). This is a common problem at vehicle inspection, particularly in California and other jurisdictions with emission standards. Most inspection stations are not aware and will try to explain the CEL/MIL \\"doesn't work\\". Skoda applications In the 1980s, Skoda manufactured a small number of rear-engined cars with Renix fuel injection. These were originally destined for Canada but ended up in Europe. These are usually known as 135 GLi or 135 RiC. Fuel system parts may be available from Chrysler-Jeep dealers. Volvo applications The Volvo 700 Series and some of the Volvo 300 Series used a B200K 2.0 L inline-4 naturally aspirated engine with Renix ignition and some 300 series Volvos with Renault powerplants. The 300 Volvo series is not known U.S. It was manufactured in the Netherlands (with a limited production of cars in Malaysia through CKD process). All 300 series Volvo cars with gasoline engines came with Renix/Bendix ignition 1983 onwards until 1991 when production of the 300 series stopped.

It was a single-engine, low-wing (Folding), wood-and-fabric monoplane with a fixed tailwheel undercarriage. Design and development Built by Percival Aircraft of Gravesend and Luton (after 1936 when Percival Aircraft became a Limited Company), the 'K-Series' Vega Gull was a development of their earlier 'D-Series' Gull. The main changes from the earlier design were the provision of an additional fourth seat, dual controls and flaps. The fuselage was widened and the wingspan increased. Increases in drag were compensated for by reducing parasitic drag from exterior fittings such as hinges and actuation horns. This work was largely attributable to the arrival at Percivals of the talented aircraft designer Arthur Bage.An Aviation Pioneer (Obituary). \\"A Record of the Bage Family History,\\" 1987.

The Vega Gull retained the de Havilland Gipsy Six air-cooled inline engine introduced in the D.3 Gull Six of 1934. Most examples were fitted with the optional DH Gipsy Six Series II engine in conjunction with the DH-PD30 VP airscrew. The final Mk II examples were fitted with a curved windscreen (the earlier examples had a multi-faceted windscreen of flat panels) similar in appearance to the early marks of the Proctor.Ellison 1997, p. 30.

Retrieved: 22 July 2008. The aircraft had left Portsmouth 52 hours 56 minutes 48 seconds earlier. With the publicity of the win, Percival set up a production line at larger premises at Luton. The new type was an immediate success with production running to 90, the last production aircraft having its maiden flight on 27 July 1939. The Vega Gull was widely used by British and Commonwealth aviators during the later years of the \\"Golden Age\\" of record-setting aviation during the 1930s. Alex Henshaw, Jim Mollison, Amy Johnson, Beryl Markham, C.W.A. Scott and others, won races and broke records to South Africa, South America, Australia and New Zealand, to name but a few. In addition to civil orders, 15 were ordered by the Air Ministry. Of these, 11 served with 24 Squadron Royal Air Force on communications duties and two were issued to the Fleet Air Arm, which was yet to come under Admiralty control. The remaining two were used by the British air attachés in Buenos Aires and Lisbon. A third aircraft for use by the British air attaché in Berlin was seized by the Germans at the outbreak of the Second World War. It remains unclear whether the Luftwaffe subsequently used this machine. After the outbreak of war, Vega Gulls were requisitioned for military use. In the UK, 21 were impressed in 1939–40, 14 for the RAF and seven for the FAA. Two aircraft were impressed in each of Australia and India, while one other was \\"called to the colours\\" in New Zealand.\\"Percival Vega Gull.\\" British Aircraft of World War II. Retrieved: 1 July 2017. By the end of the war, the Vega Gull had been largely supplanted by its younger sibling, the Proctor, of which more than 1,100 were manufactured. Most Proctors, especially the later examples, were slower and more cumbersome than the original Vega. Despite the obvious drawbacks of its wooden airframe in terms of durability, the Vega Gull compares favourably with more modern designs. To save hangar space, the wings could be folded to reduce the space needed for storage. Variants * Type K.1 Vega Gull: Single-engined, four-seat touring aeroplane.

Pevler (20 April 1903 - 29 August 1978) was the 10th president of the Roanoke, VA based Norfolk and Western Railway (N&W;). He had previously served as president of the Wabash Railroad, and served as president of the N&W; from October 1, 1963, until his retirement in April 1970. Personal life Commonwealth Magazine once described Pevler as \\"a driver who operated with doors open and coats off,\\" citing the \\"sheer force of his personality\\" and vigor in his activities. He was an alumnus of Purdue University. He was buried in Evergreen Burial Park, Roanoke, Virginia, Career In 1927, Herman Pevler commenced work with the Pennsylvania Railroad, and he was elected Vice President of that railway in 1948. In 1959, he was elected a director of the First National Bank at St. Louis. Herman Pevler was the president of Wabash Railroad before he succeeded Stuart T. Saunders as President of N&W.; Saunders left to head the Pennsylvania Railroad, a major N&W; stockholder at that time. Pevler oversaw consummation of a complex group of mergers begun under Saunders which brought into the N&W; fold the Nickel Plate Road, the Wabash Railroad and portions of the Pennsylvania Railroad. The mergers were completed in 1964, and widely expanded the company, reaching such major points as Detroit, Chicago, and St. Louis. The latter two were major gateways and interchange points with western railroads. Following the expansion, NW revenues quadrupled during Pevler's administration. Coming from the Wabash, he was the first N&W; president in the 20th century to have not come up through the lower ranks of the N&W;, and his leadership was met with some resistance by some N&W; staff. Among his legacies was a change in N&W; livery on locomotives to a blue very similar to that employed by the Wabash, which became known within the company as \\"Pevler blue.\\" As his mandatory retirement age approached, it became known that Pevler intended to recommend to the Board of Directors a top official of another railroad as his replacement. However, quick maneuvering by N&W; insiders and lobbying of key directors resulted in the selection of John P. Fishwick, a longtime N&W; staff attorney who Pevler had assigned to Cleveland to oversee a subsidiary operation. In 1959, Pevler wrote a 12-page pamphlet on Featherbedding titled The Changing Railroad Picture. Pevler supported the Demonstration Cities and Metropolitan Development Act of 1966.

Founded in 1901 and originally a Protestant missionary society, Yale-China's work is characterized by long-term relationships to build Chinese institutional capacity. Current programs include the fields of public health and nursing, legal education, English language instruction, American Studies, and cultural exchange for Chinese and American students. Publications include a regular newsletter, biennial report, and the annual Yale-China Health Journal. Establishment The Yale-China Association was first incorporated as the Yale Foreign Missionary Society, and was known informally as Yale-in- China as early as 1913. It was nondenominational from its beginnings and by the 1920s had ceased to be an overtly missionary enterprise. It was re- incorporated in 1934 as a secular organization, the Yale-in-China Association, and in 1975 as the Yale–China Association. A reflection of the religious fervor sweeping American college campuses at the end of the 19th century, which took form in the Student Volunteer Movement, Yale-China was founded in 1901 as the Yale Foreign Missionary Society by a group of Yale graduates and faculty members committed to establishing a Christian missionary presence overseas. The founders chose China as the focus of their work, in part to honor the memory of a Yale graduate from the class of 1892, Horace Tracy Pitkin, who had worked in China as a missionary and was killed in 1900 during the Boxer Uprising. The city of Changsha in Hunan Province was chosen as the base of operations in China after consultation with other foreign missionaries. Early years At the urging of the home office in New Haven as well as other missionaries in China, the Yale Mission early on assumed more of an educational than evangelical function. With the arrival of Dr. Edward H. Hume in 1905, medical education and care became a major focus of the endeavor. The educational compound that began with Dr. Hume's medical clinic eventually grew to comprise a preparatory school, the Yali School; the College of Yale- in-China (later moved to Wuhan, where it joined two other missionary colleges to form Huachung University); and the Hsiang-Ya Medical College, Nursing School and Hospital. Over the years, Hsiang-Ya (a compound of hsiang, denoting Hunan, and ya, denoting Yale-China; transliterated today as Xiangya) developed a reputation for providing the most advanced training in Western medicine in all of central and southern China. More than at other foreign-affiliated institutions, an effort was made early on to bring as many Chinese faculty and administrators on board as possible. By the late 1920s, all major leadership positions were held by Chinese, and Yale-in-China was very much a joint Sino- American enterprise. Between 1919 and 1920, future Chairman Mao Zedong had several encounters with the school: he edited its student magazine, re- focusing it on \\"thought reorientation,\\" and operated a bookshop out of its medical college.\\"Yale Group Spurs Mao's Emergence.\\" Yale Daily News, Vol. 96, No. 3, February 29, 1972, p. 1. Archived from the original. Accessed April 24, 2014. World War II The war years (1937–45) placed enormous strains on the Yale-in-China institutions, especially the Hsiang-Ya Hospital, which cared for war casualties and refugees. For example, the life of paralyzed Frank Wattendorf was spared at the hospital before he was evacuated.Theodore von Karman with Lee Edson (1967) The Wind and Beyond, page 201, Little, Brown and Company Many of the Changsha facilities were damaged by invading Japanese troops. Nevertheless, these challenges served to inspire renewed commitment on the part of both American and Chinese faculty and administrators. The Yale-in- China staff who returned to Changsha in September 1945 were determined to rebuild the campus and resume their pre-war operations. Within four years, however, a Communist insurgency toppled the Nationalist government and Yale- in-China's future seemed uncertain in the face of growing hostility between the United States and China. Hong Kong Years By 1951, the new Communist government had taken possession of Yale-in-China's Changsha properties and renamed the Yali School as \\"Liberation Middle School.\\" Dr. Dwight Rugh, Yale- in-China's last representative in Changsha, spent most of 1950 under house arrest as the only American on campus, and was eventually expelled from China in May 1951. With his departure, the ties between Yale-in-China in New Haven and the institutions in Changsha and Wuhan were broken for nearly 30 years. Between 1951 and 1954, hostility against the United States on the mainland and turmoil on Nationalist-held Taiwan led to a suspension of Yale-in-China's work within China. Preston Schoyer, who had been a Bachelor in Changsha before the war, worked both formally and informally to develop new programs and maintain ties with old friends. During those years, Yale-in-China devoted its resources to financing the education of Chinese students in the U.S. while looking in Asia for new projects to support. Attention soon focused on a refugee college in the British colony of Hong Kong which had been founded by Ch'ien Mu (1895–1990) and other Chinese intellectuals determined to preserve traditional Chinese learning and values in the face of the Communist victory on the mainland. In early 1954, after a visit to the colony and months of negotiations, Yale-in-China's trustees formally affiliated the organization with New Asia College. Unlike in Changsha, Yale-in-China's relationship with New Asia College was, by intention, one of support and assistance rather than direct administration. Yale-in-China secured funding from the Ford Foundation and other U.S. foundations to support the development of the college, and also provided fellowships for New Asia faculty to pursue further study in the United States. In 1956, Yale-in-China resumed the practice of sending Bachelors, two recent Yale graduates, to teach English, though now to New Asia College instead of the Yali School. In the late 1950s, the possibility of founding a university in Hong Kong that would use Chinese as the language of instruction was explored. In 1959, the Council of British Universities selected New Asia, United and Chung Chi colleges to federate and form the new Chinese University of Hong Kong, which was formally inaugurated in 1963 on its Shatin campus. Preston Schoyer played a key role in negotiating New Asia's entrance. Yale-in-China contributed to the new campus by securing funds to construct buildings, including the university health clinic, the Yali Guest House, Friendship Lodge and a student dormitory at New Asia College. Yale-in- China also contributed to the early internationalization of the campus by helping to establish the New Asia - Yale-in-China Chinese Language Centre and the International Asian Studies Programme, which now enroll hundreds of international students every year. Meanwhile, the relationship with New Asia College, where the Yale–China Association (as the organization was renamed in 1975) has maintained a representative office for fifty years, remains a strong one. Return to the Mainland By the 1970s, both New Asia College and the Chinese University of Hong Kong had achieved a level of institutional maturity and financial stability that decreased the need for Yale-China's contributions. At the same time, the normalization of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and China presented the possibility of resumed activity on the mainland. In the fall of 1979, Yale-China staff traveled to Changsha to explore opportunities for academic exchange with administrators and faculty at Hunan Medical College, the successor to Hsiang-Ya, and several exchange agreements were concluded that led to the arrival of Yale-China English teachers in September 1980 and exchanges of medical personnel between Yale University and Hunan Medical College. Two English instructors were also sent to Wuhan University the same year and later to Huazhong Normal University. Despite the geographical continuities, however, the intervening years had brought substantial changes to Chinese higher education and within Yale-China itself. Political sensitivities in China and Yale-China's own evolution determined that any new activity in China would be of a nature substantially different from that of the pre-1949 years. Rather than seeking to resume the joint administration of the former Yale-in-China institutions, the emphasis was placed on shorter-term academic exchanges in the fields of medicine and American Studies and a resumption of the English language instruction program. Throughout the 1980s, Yale-China's medical program brought almost 50 Chinese medical personnel to the U.S. and sent over 40 Americans to China for exchanges of medical knowledge. During the same years, nearly 100 Yale graduates participated in Yale-China's English teaching program in China. Yale-China also continued to send English teachers to the Chinese University of Hong Kong and maintained its involvement with the university's International Asian Studies Program. The decade of the 1990s brought an expansion of Yale-China's activities into new program areas and affiliations with institutions outside of Yale-China's historical bases in Hong Kong, Changsha and Wuhan. While maintaining its English teaching program, Yale-China initiated projects in environmental protection and pediatric cardiology and facilitated a drama collaboration between New Haven's Long Wharf Theater and the Shanghai People's Art Theater which resulted in a Chinese-language stage production of Amy Tan's Joy Luck Club in 1994. Other areas of expansion have included the fields of American Studies, legal education, public health, nursing, and service in the non-profit sector for China and American students.

The three-story steel coaster was built in-house by Silver Dollar City in 1972. The ride is often considered a cross between a dark ride and a roller coaster. A similar ride, \\"Blazing Fury\\", was built at Herschend Family Entertainment's Silver Dollar City Tennessee, now known as Dollywood, in 1978. Theme A bartender rescues a dance hall girl from the town's tavern. This Baldknobber is blasting riders with his cannon while a coyote eerily howls close by. The Baldknobber pictured was once hanging on a rope by his neck, but has changed to its current form in recent years. The cannon came from Silver Dollar City's musical production, “For the Glory.” Fire in the Hole is themed around the story of Marmaros, an Ozarks hill town. Marmaros was built near Marvel Cave and is the present day site of the theme park Silver Dollar City. Marmaros grew out of necessity. The miners attracted to the mining of guano from the cave along with their families began to grow in number. The investors designed a town with the intentions of becoming a resort village such as Eureka Springs, Arkansas or Monte Ne, Arkansas. Investments became substantial and the town's population grew rapidly. Marmaros’ existence relied heavily upon the mining operation of Marvel Cave. The town failed to attract tourists and began to slowly die out after mining ceased. Much of the town was later destroyed by fire, and what was left moved to a location south of the cave and is now submerged below Table Rock Lake. The town was rumored to be burnt to the ground by a group of vigilantes known as the Baldknobbers. Obscure facts have turned into legend which makes deciphering the story virtually impossible. Some believe the burning of the village started out as a drunken fight in a local tavern. Others blame xenophobic outrage over William H. Lynch, a Canadian businessman who purchased Marvel Cave; Lynch would later open the cave as a tourist attraction. Evidence proves that the town did in fact burn, however the true story may never be established. The original concept of the ride relied heavily upon Marvel Cave itself. During the planning phases of Fire in the Hole the ride was referred to as The Devil's Den. This was a name given to the cave centuries before mining operation had started. The ride was to include volcanoes and exploding geysers. However, modifications were eventually made and the ride took on its current form. Fire in the Hole's dated production values and odd subject matter have made the ride a cult favorite, with some people even developing \\"callback lines\\" to shout at various points during the ride. Riders pass scenes of the town's residents trying to extinguish the flames before crossing a collapsing bridge, nearly getting run-over by a steam train, and crashing into a dynamite storage shack. In the ride's finale the coaster trains are sent hurtling over a drop into a pool of water with a splash down finish. The splash has been part of the ride since its conception. Water cannons within the splash down lake can be enhanced during the summer months to drench riders and turned off during the cooler seasons to only mist riders. Scenes A section of a scene that has been removed. The scene gave the rider the illusion of broken tracks over a deep chasm. When it appeared to the riders that they would be in peril a sharp right turn away from the cliff was made. Throughout the ride, there are many scenes of Marmaros engulfed in flames. The scenes include a burning hotel, a camp of Baldknobbers, a blazing cabin, a collapsing bridge, and a Main Street which includes a saloon, undertaker, and blacksmith shop. A shootout takes place on Main Street between three Baldknobbers and the town sheriff. This results in the undertaker's windows being shot out and bullet holes in the water tower spraying riders. To increase rider capacity a large section of track was removed in 1982. After the first dip (Collapsing Bridge) the ride would turn right and later reconnect in front of the second one (Train Collision). At the scene where the cabin is burning, there is a moon and some stars above one of the old track areas. Also, at the sign for “Kinney Bridge”, to rider's left is a large open area where scenes once existed. The removed scenes included one with a group of Baldknobbers having the following conversation: \\"All right boys remember, don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes.\\" A gun fires. \\"Ow! You damn knocked me (or you damn knock-kneed...) Oh, excuse me kids.\\" After that scene, the ride encounters the Baldknobber dumping the barrel on the riders (now moved to another part of the ride). This was followed by a sign reading, \\"Danger, Track out ahead\\". Coming out of the tunnel, riders saw what appeared to be the track mangled, hanging off a cliff. Just as they headed out over it, the cars cut back sharply on the real track. The track then reconnected with the existing track headed for the train hill. Theme Song A song was created in 1972 to accompany the ride. It plays throughout the ride and on the exterior of the building. While waiting in the exterior queue-line one can hear it along with conversations between two men exclaiming the heroic deeds of firefighters. Incidents References * Payton, Crystal.

The exclamation mark often marks the end of a sentence, for example: \\"Watch out!\\" Similarly, a bare exclamation mark (with nothing before or after) is often used in warning signs. Other uses include: * In mathematics, it denotes the factorial operation. * Several computer languages use at the beginning of an expression to denote logical negation. For example, means \\"the logical negation of A\\", also called \\"not A\\". This usage has spread to ordinary language (e.g. \\"!clue\\" means no-clue or clueless). * Some languages use to denote a click consonant. History Graphically, the exclamation mark is represented by variations on the theme of a full stop point with a vertical line above. One theory of its origin posits derivation from a Latin exclamation of joy, namely , analogous to \\"hurray\\"; the modern graphical representation is believed to have originated in the Middle Ages; medieval copyists wrote the Latin word at the end of a sentence, to indicate expression of joy. Over time, the i moved above the o; that o first became smaller, and (with time) a dot. The exclamation mark was first introduced into English printing in the 15th century to show emphasis, and was called the \\"sign of admiration or exclamation\\" or the \\"note of admiration\\" until the mid-17th century; \\"admiration\\" referred to that word's Latin- language sense, of wonderment. Many pre-computer age typewriters did not have the exclamation mark. Instead the user typed a full stop and then backspaced and overtyped an apostrophe. Such typewriters often lacked a '1' key as well (the user typed a lower-case 'L'). That is why the exclamation point is usually shift+1 as both were added at the same time. Slang and other names for the exclamation mark In the 1950s, secretarial dictation and typesetting manuals in America referred to the mark as \\"bang\\", perhaps from comic books where the ! appeared in dialogue balloons to represent a gun being fired, although the nickname probably emerged from letterpress printing. This bang usage is behind the names of the interrobang, an unconventional typographic character, and a shebang, a feature of Unix computer systems. In the printing world, the exclamation mark can be called a screamer, a gasper, a slammer, or a startler. In hacker culture, the exclamation mark is called \\"bang\\", \\"shriek\\", or, in the British slang known as Commonwealth Hackish, \\"pling\\". For example, the password communicated in the spoken phrase \\"Your password is em- nought-pee-aitch-pling-en-three\\" is \`m0ph!n3\`.  Languages  The exclamation mark is common to languages using the Latin alphabet, although usage varies slightly between languages. It has also been adopted in languages written in other scripts, such as languages written with Cyrillic or Arabic scripts, Chinese characters, and Devanagari. = English = A sentence ending in an exclamation mark may represent an exclamation or an interjection (such as \\"Wow!\\", \\"Boo!\\"), or an imperative (\\"Stop!\\"), or may indicate astonishment or surprise: \\"They were the footprints of a gigantic hound!\\" Exclamation marks are occasionally placed mid-sentence with a function similar to a comma, for dramatic effect, although this usage is obsolete: \\"On the walk, oh! there was a frightful noise.\\"The Tell-Tale Heart by Edgar Allan Poe. \\"Villains!\\" I shrieked, \\"dissemble no more! I admit the deed! — tear up the planks! — here, here! — it is the beating of his hideous heart!\\" Informally, exclamation marks may be repeated for additional emphasis (\\"That's great!!!\\"), but this practice is generally considered unacceptable in formal prose. The exclamation mark is sometimes used in conjunction with the question mark. This can be in protest or astonishment (\\"Out of all places, the squatter-camp?!\\"); a few writers replace this with a single, nonstandard punctuation mark, the interrobang, which is the combination of a question mark and an exclamation mark. Overly frequent use of the exclamation mark is generally considered poor writing, for it distracts the reader and devalues the mark's significance. Some authors, most notably Tom Wolfe and Madison Acampora, are known for unashamedly liberal use of the exclamation mark. In comic books, the very frequent use of exclamation mark is common—see Comics, below. For information on the use of spaces after an exclamation mark, see the discussion of spacing after a full stop. Several studies have shown that women use exclamation marks more than men do. One study suggests that, in addition to other uses, exclamation marks may also function as markers of friendly interaction, for example, by making \\"Hi!\\" or \\"Good luck!\\" seem friendlier than simply \\"Hi.\\" or \\"Good luck.\\" (with periods). However, use of exclamation marks in contexts that are not unambiguously positive can be misinterpreted as indicating hostility. In English writing and often subtitles, a (!) symbol (an exclamation mark within parentheses) implies that a character has made an obviously sarcastic comment e.g.: \\"Ooh, a sarcasm detector. That's a really useful invention(!)\\" It also is used to indicate surprise at one's own experience or statement. = French = In French, next to marking exclamations or indicating astonishment, the exclamation mark is also commonly used to mark orders or requests: (English: 'Come here!'). A space () is used between the last word and the exclamation mark in European French, but not in Canadian French. One can also combine an exclamation mark with a question mark at the end of a sentence where appropriate. = German = German uses the exclamation mark for several things that English conveys with other punctuation: * It is used at the end of imperative sentences even when not particularly emphatic: ('Call me tomorrow.') A normal full stop, as in English, is fairly common but is considered substandard. * A related use is on signs that express a command or interdiction: (English: 'No trespassing!'). * The exclamation mark may also be used in the salutation line of a letter: (English: 'Dear Hans,'). However, the use of a comma is equally correct and is more common. = Cantonese = Cantonese has not historically used dedicated punctuation marks, rather relying on grammatical markers to denote the end of a statement. Usage of exclamation marks is common in written Mandarin and in some Yue speaking regions. The Canton and Hong Kong regions, however, generally refused to accept the exclamation mark as it was seen as carrying with it unnecessary and confusing Western connotations; however, an exclamation mark, including in some written representations of colloquy in Cantonese, can be used informally to indicate strong feeling. For example, to represent a response of someone surprised by a gift, one could write: \\"\\" (, \\"thanks!\\"). =Greek= In Modern Greek, the exclamation mark (, ) has been introduced from Latin scripts and is used identically, although without the reluctance seen in English usage.Nicolas, Nick. \\"Greek Unicode Issues: Punctuation\\". 2005. Accessed 7 Oct 2014. A minor grammatical difference is that, while a series of interjections each employ an exclamation mark (e.g., , , 'Oops! Oh!'), an interjection should only be separated from an extended exclamation by a comma (e.g., , , 'Oops! I left the stove on.'). = Hungarian = In Hungarian, an exclamation mark is put at the end of exclamations, imperative or prohibitive sentences, and sentences expressing a wish (e.g. - 'How beautiful!', - 'Keep off the grass', - 'If only my plan had worked out.'). The use of the exclamation mark is also needed when addressing someone and the addressing is a separate sentence. (typically at the beginning of letters, e.g. - 'Dear Peter,'). Greetings are also typically terminated with an exclamation mark (e.g. - 'Good evening.'). = Spanish = Trilingual billboard in Barcelona (detail), showing the initial exclamation mark for Spanish, but not for Catalan (top line) and English In Spanish, a sentence or clause ending in an exclamation mark must also begin with an inverted exclamation mark (the same also applies to the question mark): , 'Are you crazy? You almost killed her!' As in British English, a bracketed exclamation mark may be used to indicate irony or surprise at a statement: , 'He said that he's not going to a party tonight(!).' Such use is not matched by an inverted opening exclamation mark. = Turkish = In Turkish, an exclamation mark is used after a sentence or phrase for emphasis, and is common following both commands and the addressees of such commands. For example, in the ('Armies! Your first target is the Mediterranean') order by Atatürk, ('the armies') constitute the addressee. It is further used in parentheses, , after a sentence or phrase to indicate irony or sarcasm: , 'You've done a very good job – Not!'. = Limbu = In Limbu, an exclamation mark is used after a Limbu sentence or phrase for emphasis, and is common following both commands and the addressees of such commands. For example, in the Limbu sentence ᤐᤚᤢ᥄ ᤄᤨᤘᤑ ᤂᤥᤆᤌᤙ Mediterranean, ᤚᤦᤛᤅ᥄ — Paṡu! Ghōwapha khōcathaśa Mediterranean, ṡausaṅa! (Armies! Your first target is the Mediterranean!). It is further used in parentheses, (᥄), after a sentence or phrase to indicate irony or sarcasm: ᤖᤥᤂᤌ ᤔᤚᤗ ᤐᤤ ᤊᤇ ᤃᤦᤄ (᥄) — Rōkhatha maṡala pai yancha gaugha (!) (You did a very good job — Not!). = Phonetics = In Khoisan languages, and the International Phonetic Alphabet, the exclamation mark is used as a letter to indicate the postalveolar click sound (represented as q in Zulu orthography). In Unicode, this letter is properly coded as and distinguished from the common punctuation symbol to allow software to deal properly with word breaks. The exclamation mark has sometimes been used as a phonetic symbol to indicate that a consonant is ejective. More commonly this is represented by an apostrophe, or a superscript glottal stop symbol (). Proper names Although not part of dictionary words, exclamation marks appear in some brand names and trade names, including Yum! Brands (parent of fast food chains like Taco Bell and KFC) and Web services Yahoo! and Joomla!. It appears in the titles of stage and screen works, especially comedies and musicals; examples include the game show Jeopardy!; the '60s musical TV show Shindig!; musicals Oklahoma!, Oliver! and Oh! Calcutta!; and movies Airplane! and Moulin Rouge!. Writer Elliot S! Maggin and cartoonist Scott Shaw! include exclamation marks in their names. In the 2016 United States presidential campaign, Republican candidate Jeb Bush used \\"Jeb!\\" as his campaign logo. =Place names= The English town of Westward Ho!, named after the novel by Charles Kingsley, is the only place name in the United Kingdom that officially contains an exclamation mark. There is a town in Quebec called Saint-Louis-du- Ha! Ha!, which is spelled with two exclamation marks. The city of Hamilton, Ohio, changed its name to Hamilton! in 1986, but neither the United States Board on Geographic Names nor mapmakers Rand McNally recognised the change. The city of Ostrava, Czech Republic, changed its logotype to Ostrava!!! in 2008. Warnings Warning signs are often an exclamation mark enclosed within a triangle. Exclamation marks are used to emphasize a precautionary statement. On warning signs, an exclamation mark is often used to draw attention to a warning of danger, hazards, and the unexpected. These signs are common in hazardous environments or on potentially dangerous equipment. A common type of this warning is a yellow triangle with a black exclamation mark, but a white triangle with a red border is common on European road warning signs. New Zealand road sign warning of a \\"cattle stop\\" (cattle grid/cattle guard) Use in various fields =Mathematics and formal logic= In mathematics, the symbol represents the factorial operation. The expression ! means \\"the product of the integers from 1 to \\". For example, 4! (read four factorial) is 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24. (0! is defined as 1, which is a neutral element in multiplication, not multiplied by anything.) Additionally, it can also represent the uniqueness quantifier or, if used in front of a number, it can represent a subfactorial. In linear logic, the exclamation mark denotes one of the modalities that control weakening and contraction. =Computing= In computing, the exclamation mark is ASCII character 33 (21 in hexadecimal). Due to its availability on even early computers, the character was used for many purposes. The name given to \\"!\\" by programmers varies according to their background, though it was very common to give it a short name to make reading code aloud easier. \\"Bang\\" is very popular. In the UK the term pling was popular in the earlier days of computing, whilst in the United States, the term shriek was used. It is claimed that these word usages were invented in the US and shriek is from Stanford or MIT; however, shriek for the ! sign is found in the Oxford English Dictionary dating from the 1860s. Many computer languages using C-style syntax use \\"!\\" for logical negation; means \\"not A\\", and means \\"A is not equal to B\\". This negation principle has spread to ordinary language; for example, the word \\"!clue\\" is used as a synonym for \\"no- clue\\" or \\"clueless\\".Raymond, Eric and Steele, Guy. The New Hacker's Dictionary, p. 18 (MIT Press 1996).Munat, Judith. Lexical Creativity, Texts and Context, p. 148 (John Benjamins Publishing, 2007). Early e-mail systems also used the exclamation mark as a separator character between hostnames for routing information, usually referred to as \\"bang path\\" notation. In the IRC protocol, a user's nickname and ident are separated by an exclamation mark in the hostmask assigned to him or her by the server. In UNIX scripting (typically for UNIX shell or Perl), \\"!\\" is usually used after a \\"#\\" in the first line of a script, the interpreter directive, to tell the OS what program to use to run the script. is usually called a \\"hash-bang\\" or shebang. A similar convention for PostScript files calls for the first line to begin with , called \\"percent-bang\\". An exclamation mark starts history expansions in many Unix shells such as bash and tcsh where executes the previous command and refers to all of the arguments from the previous command. Acorn RISC OS uses filenames starting with pling to create an application directory: for instance a file called \`!Run\` is executed when the folder containing it is double- clicked (holding down shift prevents this). There is also \`!Boot\` (executed the first time the application containing it comes into view of the filer), \`!Sprites\` (icons), \`!Help\`, and others. In APL, is used for factorial of x (backwards from math notation), and also for the binomial coefficient: means \\\\tbinom nk or . BBC BASIC used pling as an indirection operator, equivalent to PEEK and POKE of four bytes at once. BCPL, the precursor of C, used \\"!\\" for pointer and array indirection: is equivalent to in C, and is equivalent to in C. In the Haskell programming language, \\"!\\" is used to express strictness. In the ML programming language (including Standard ML and OCaml), \\"!\\" is the operator to get the value out of a \\"reference\\" data structure. In the Raku programming language, the \\"!\\" twigil is used to access private attributes or methods in a class (like \`class Person { has $!name; }\` or \`self!private- method;\`). In the Scheme, Julia,[The Julia Language documentation https://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/base/base/#Introduction-1], accessed 8 July 2019. and Ruby programming languages, \\"!\\" is conventionally the suffix for functions and special forms that mutate their input. In the Swift programming language, a type followed by \\"!\\" denotes an \\"implicitly unwrapped optional\\", an option type where the compiler does not enforce safe unwrapping. The \\"!\\" operator \\"force unwraps\\" an option type, causing an error if it is nil. In Geek Code version 3, \\"!\\" is used before a letter to denote that the geek refuses to participate in the topic at hand. In some cases, it has an alternate meaning, such as G! denoting a geek of no qualifications, !d denoting not wearing any clothes, P! denoting not being allowed to use Perl, and so on. They all share some negative connotations, however. =Video games= The exclamation mark can be used in video games to signify that a character is startled or alarmed. In the Metal Gear and Paper Mario series, an exclamation mark appears over enemies' heads when they notice the player. In massively multiplayer online (MMO) games such as World of Warcraft, an exclamation mark hovering over a character's head indicates that they are offering a quest for the player to complete. In Dota 2, an exclamation mark is shown above the head of a unit if it is killed by means not granting enemies experience or gold (if it is \\"denied\\"). In the 2005 arcade dance simulation game In the Groove 2, there is a song titled \\"!\\" (also referred to as \\"bang\\") by the artist Onyx. =Internet culture= In recent Internet culture, especially where leet is used, multiple exclamation marks may be affixed with the numeral \\"1\\" as in !!!!!!111. The notation originates from a common error: when typing multiple exclamation points quickly, the typist may fail to hold the combination that produces the exclamation mark on many keyboard layouts. This error, first used intentionally as a joke in the leet linguistic community, is now an accepted form of exclamation in leet and derivative dialects such as Lolspeak. Some utterances include further substitutions, for example \\"!!!111oneeleven\\". In fandom and fanfiction, ! is used to signify a defining quality in a character, usually signifying an alternative interpretation of a character from a canonical work. Examples of this would be \\"Romantic!Draco\\" or \\"Vampire!Harry\\" from Harry Potter fandom. It is also used to clarify the current persona of a character with multiple identities or appearances, such as to distinguish \\"Armor!Al\\" from \\"Human!Al\\" in a work based on Fullmetal Alchemist. The origin of this usage is unknown, although it is hypothesized to have originated with certain Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles action figures, for example, \\"Football Player! Leonardo\\", \\"Rockstar! Raphael\\", and \\"Breakdancer! Michelangelo\\". =Comics= This Action Comics cover from 1959 ends every sentence with an exclamation point or question mark. Often, few or no periods would be used in the entire book. Some comic books, especially superhero comics of the mid-20th century, routinely use the exclamation point instead of the period, which means the character has just realized something; unlike when the question mark appears instead, which means the character is confused, surprised or they do not know what is happening. This tends to lead to exaggerated speech, in line with the other hyperboles common in comic books. A portion of the motivation, however, was simply that a period might disappear in the printing process used at the time, whereas an exclamation point would likely remain recognizable even if there was a printing glitch. For a short period Stan Lee, as Editor-in-Chief of Marvel Comics, attempted to curb their overuse by a short-lived ban on exclamation points altogether, which led to an inadvertent lack of ending punctuation on many sentences.Cronin, Brian (January 28, 2010). Comic Book Legends Revealed #245. Comic Book Resources. Retrieved 2010-08-26. Comic book writer Elliot S! Maggin once accidentally signed his name with an exclamation due to the habit of using them when writing comic scripts; it became his professional name from then on.Adams, Eury, Swan (2006). The Krypton Companion. TwoMorrows Publishing. p. 141. . Retrieved 2010-08-25. Similarly, comic artist Scott Shaw! has used the exclamation point after his name throughout his career. In comic books and comics in general, a large exclamation point is often used near or over a character's head to indicate surprise. A question mark can similarly be used to indicate confusion. =Chess= In chess notation \\"!\\" denotes a good move, \\"!!\\" denotes an excellent move, \\"?!\\" denotes a dubious move, and \\"!?\\" denotes an interesting, risky move. In some chess variants such as large-board Shogi variants, \\"!\\" is used to record pieces capturing by stationary feeding or burning. =Scrabble= In Scrabble, an exclamation mark written after a word is used to indicate its presence in the Official Tournament and Club Word List but its absence from the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary, usually because the word has been judged offensive. =Baseball= Exclamation points or asterisks can be used on scorecards to denote a \\"great defensive play\\".Holz, Sean.

American musician Pink stylizes her stage name \\"P!NK\\", and uses three exclamation points in the subtitle of her 2010 release, Greatest Hits... So Far!!!. =Television= The exclamation mark was included in the title of Dinah Shore's TV series, Dinah! The exclamation mark was later the subject of a bitter argument between Elaine Benes and her boyfriend, Jake Jarmel, in the Seinfeld episode, \\"The Sniffing Accountant\\". Elaine got upset with Jake for not putting an exclamation mark at the end of a message about her friend having a baby. Jake took extreme exception to the trivial criticism and broke up with Elaine, putting an exclamation mark after his parting words: \\"I'm leaving!\\" =Theatre= In musicals, an exclamation mark is usually used when the title of the show has the same title of a song within the act. Examples of this are shows like Oklahoma! and Mamma Mia!.

Johnson's war on crime. History The LEAA was established by the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 and was abolished in 1982. Its predecessor agency was the Office of Law Enforcement Assistance (1965–1968). Its successor agencies were the Office of Justice Assistance, Research, and Statistics (1982–1984) and the Office of Justice Programs (1984–). LEAA included the National Institute of Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice, which had its functions absorbed by the National Institute of Justice on December 27, 1979, with passage of the Justice System Improvement Act of 1979. The Act, which amended the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, also led to creation of the Bureau of Justice Statistics. LEAA also included the National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals. Initiatives In March 1973, the LEAA ordered any police department receiving federal funding to end minimum height requirements, which most women could not meet. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the LEAA promoted policing initiatives such as the STRESS (Stop the Robberies, Enjoy Safe Streets) in Detroit and CRASH (Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums) in Los Angeles.

He was an erstwhile President of the Indian National Science Academy and National Research Professor of the Government of India. He was awarded the Padma Vibushan in 2005 for his contributions to health technology in India. He was made a Chevalier in the Ordre des Palmes Académiques, an honour bestowed by the French government, in 1999. He received the Dr. Samuel P. Asper International Award from the Johns Hopkins University Medical School in 2009 for his contributions to international medical education. Early life and education He was born to Marthanda Varma and Janaki Varma in 1934. His early education was at a government school in Mavelikara, followed by the University College, Trivandrum. Valiathan's medical education took place at the Medical College, Trivandum, University of Kerala, where he obtained his M B B S degree(1951-1956).http://doctor.ndtv.com/expert/ndtv/expertid/20/MS_Valiathan.html He later went to the University of Liverpool in Liverpool, England as a surgical trainee and received his fellowship from the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and England in 1960 and master's degree in surgery from the University of Liverpool. After a brief stint as a faculty member at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh he underwent further training in cardiac surgery at the Johns Hopkins, George Washington, and Georgetown University Hospitals, USA. He worked as a Fellow of Doctors Vincent Gott at the Hopkins and Charles Hufnagel at the Georgetown University With mentor, Dr. Charles Hufnagel He was also granted the fellowship of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada in cardiovascular surgery in 1970. Academic career He has served on the faculty of the Georgetown University Hospital, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Indian Institute of Technology, Madras and as director of Sree Chitra Thirunal Institute of Medical Sciences and Technology. Subsequently, Valiathan became the first Vice-Chancellor of Manipal University in 1994. =Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute (1974–1994)= In 1972, Valiathan returned to India and had an uncertain beginning at the Safdarjung Hospital in New Delhi. Soon after he moved to Indian Institute of Technology Madras where his responsibility was teaching with low priority for research. Several friends and colleagues, including Dr. Hufnagel wondered whether he had made a foolish mistake in opting to leave the United States. However he received an invitation from the Government of Kerala where the Chief Minister, Shri Achutha Menon, asked him to develop a hospital for specialities in the new, unoccupied building of Sree Chitra Tirunal Center, Trivandrum, and gave him freedom and authority to accomplish the task. The hospital was set up in two years and patients with cardiovascular and neurologic diseases admitted for treatment. Simultaneously the development of cardiovascular devices was initiated with the support of the Science and Engineering Research Council of the Government of India. As Sree Chitra Institute grew, it received support from prime minister Morarji Desai and was notified as \\"An Institution of National Importance\\" by an Act of Parliament within five years of Dr. Valiathan's leadership . In 1975, the demand for prosthetic valves was high in the hospital, which could not be met by imported valves in view of prohibitive cost. The state of Kerala had but one licensed abattoir at that time in Koothattukulam, which slaughtered less than 200 pigs per month and made procine valve development unviable. As autopsies were much fewer, homograft valve development was even less viable. Under these circumstances, Dr. Valiathan and his team opted to develop a mechanical valve of tilting-disc design. The currently marketed Chitra-TTK valve is the fourth model in a series that was developed over a decade of effort. In the first model, the major and minor struts were electron beam welded and the valve was expected to withstand 360 million cycles of disc movement. Unfortunately, the major strut fractured at the weld after a mere 100,000 cycles due to weld embrittlement. In the second model, the disk was made of single crystal sapphire which was inert and blood compatible. The housing was carved out of a block of titanium. This model failed as well because of extensive wear of titanium struts and escape of the disc. The third model had a housing made of a highly wear- resistant superalloy, \\"Haynes-25\\", a cobalt based alloy of chromium, nickel and tungsten. This model went through all the tests successfully and several sheep with the implanted valve were alive and well for months until the death of one animal at 3 months after valve implantation. Necropsy showed that the sapphire disc had fractured and caused the death of the animal. This was a major crisis as critics and media did not spare the Chitra team.Chitra valve development- changing perception of intelligentsia However the fourth model was a success and more than 100,000 valves have been implanted in patients (till 2016).The multidisciplinary team at the Sree Chitra Institute led by Dr.Valiathan also developed a vascular graft and a series of disposable devices such as blood bag, oxygenator and cardiotomy reservoir, which are in commercial production in industrial units in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. =Current work= After about twenty years at Sri Chitra, Dr. Valiathan became the Vice- Chancellor of the newly set up Manipal University (then MAHE, Manipal Academy of Higher Education). After laying down office as Vice-Chancellor in 1999, he was awarded a Senior Fellowship by the Homi Bhabha Council to pursue a study of Charaka, which culminated in the publication a book \\"The Legacy of Charaka\\". Later on, as a National Research Professor, he carried out a study of Sushruta and Vagbhata and completed the series of Legacy volumes on the \` Great Three' of Ayurveda. In an interview, Dr. Valiathan had observed, \\"At this time there is no common ground where physicists, chemists, immunologists and molecular biologists can interact with Ayurvedic physicians. Ayurveda is not only the mother of medicine but also of all life sciences in India. In spite of it, science has been completely divorced from Ayurveda... But these are the interdisciplinary areas where advances will take place.\\" Earlier in another article, he had written, \\"To ignore the testimony of thousands of patients over many decades is reminiscent of the derisive attitude of Edward Jenner's contemporaries in Gloucestershire who despised the claim of milkmaids that cow pox gave them protection from small pox! When Jenner wrote to his mentor John Hunter on the observed facts and the arguments against it, Hunter gave his famous reply, \\"Why think? Why not experiment?\\". That applies to Ayurveda whose time to experiment has arrived. Currently, Dr. Valiathan is engaged in promoting research in basic sciences, based on cues from Ayurvedic concepts and procedures. The research in prominent institutes is being supported by government funding in \\"A Science Initiative in Ayurveda\\" (ASIIA). In his report, during the seventeenth meeting of the Scientific Advisory Committee to the Cabinet (SAC-C) in 2009, under the Chairmanship of Dr. R. Chidambaram, Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India, Dr. Valiathan lauded the support of the Indian government while presenting an update on ongoing projects. ASIIA made good progress and has been taken over by the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India, for sustained support under a \\"Task Force in Ayurvedic Biology\\", which appears on the SERB website. He has also given a course of video lectures on \` The Ayurvedic Inheritance of India ' under the NPTEL programme of the IITs of India ( https://web.archive.org/web/20151028200338/http://nptel.iitm.ac.in/). These lectures provided the material for his book \` Ayurvedic Inheritance; A Reader's Companion'published by Manipal University Press in 2017. Awards and honours Dr.Valiathan's contributions to medical sciences and technology have brought him many honours and awards such as the Fellowships of the Indian Academy of Sciences, Indian National Science Academy, National Academy of Sciences, India, National Academy of Medical Sciences, Indian National Academy of Engineering, The World Academy of Sciences, American College of Cardiology, the Royal College of Physicians of London and the International Union of Societies of Biomaterials and Engineering. He is a Hunterian Professor of the Royal College of Surgeons of England and a Senior Member of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons of the United States and the Society of Cardiothoracic Surgeons of Great Britain. The French Government has honoured him by making him a Chevalier in the order of Palmes Académiques. He is a recipient of many Awards for Science, Technology and Education, which include the R.D. Birla Award, O.P. Bhasin Award, Jawaharlal Nehru Award, Dhanwantari Prize, Aryabhata medal, Basanti Devi Amirchand Prize, J.C. Bose medal, Kerala State Science and Technology Award, B.C. Guha Award, Pinnamaneni Foundation Award, Sat Pal Mittal Award, G.M. Modi Award, M. V. Pylee Award, H.K. Firodia Award and the Sastra Puraskaram of the Kerala Government.

The word has a long history in both Spain and Portugal as well as in Spanish and Portuguese languages. It was originally associated with the ideal societal role men were expected to play in their communities, most particularly, Iberian language-speaking societies and countries. in Portuguese and Spanish is a strictly masculine term, derived from the Latin mascŭlus meaning male (today or , c.f. Portuguese and now- obsolete for humans ; macho and , in their most common sense, are used for males of non-human animal species). Machos in Iberian-descended cultures are expected to possess and display bravery, courage and strength as well as wisdom and leadership, and ser macho (literally, \\"to be a macho\\") was an aspiration for all boys.  Caballerosidad  Portrait of Marlon Brando as Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire \\"\\" in Spanish, or in Portuguese, or the English mixture of both but not a proper word in any of the previously mentioned languages, caballerismo, is a Latin American understanding of manliness that focuses more on honour and chivalry. The meaning of caballero is \\"gentleman\\" (derived from the one who follows a code of honour like knights used to do, or shares certain values and ideals associated with them that included, among others like a particular pride in honour, treating women kindly with especial delicacy and attention). Latin American scholars have noted that positive descriptors of machismo resemble the characteristics associated with the concept of caballerosidad.Opazo, R. M (2008). Latino Youth and Machismo: Working Towards a More Complex Understanding of Marginalized Masculinities. Retrieved From Ryerson University Digital Commons Thesis Dissertation Paper 108. http://digitalcommons.ryerson.ca/dissertations/108 Understandings of machismo in Latin American cultures are not all negative; they also involve the characteristics of honour, responsibility, perseverance and courage, related to both individual and group interaction. Studies show Latin American men understand masculinity to involve considerable childcare responsibilities, politeness, respect for women's autonomy, and non-violent attitudes and behaviors.Gutmann, Matthew (1996). The Meanings of Macho: Being a Man in Mexico City. Berkeley and London: University of California Press. In this way, machismo comes to mean both positive and negative understanding of Latin American male identity within the immigrant context. Therefore, machismo, like all social constructions of identity, should be understood as having multiple layers. The word originates from the Spanish word , Spanish for \\"knight\\". refers to a chivalric masculine code of behavior. (Note that the English term also stems from the Latin root caballus, through the French chevalier). Like the English chivalric code, developed out of a medieval socio-historical class system in which people of wealth and status owned horses for transportation and other forms of horsepower whereas the lower classes did not. It was also associated with the class of knights in the feudal system. In Spanish, referred to a land-owning colonial gentleman of high station who was master of estates and/or ranches. Depictions The depictions of Machismo vary, like the Argentine gaucho, though their characteristics are quite familiar. Machismo is based on biological, historical, cultural, psycho-social and interpersonal traits or behaviors. Some of the well known traits are; *Posturing; assume a certain, often unusual or exaggerated body posture or attitude. They must settle all differences, verbal or physical abuse, or challenges and disagreements with violence as opposed to diplomacy. Treating their wife as a display of an aloof lord- protector. Women are loving, men conquer. *Bravado; outrageous boasting, overconfidence. *Social dominance; as a socio-culturally defined dominance; macho swagger. *Sexual prowess, being sexually assertive. Shyness is a collective issue for men. *Protecting one's honor. A belief in protecting honor in spite of risks. *A willingness to face danger. The psycho-social traits as can be summarized as; emotional invulnerability, patriarchal dominance, aggressive or controlling responses to stimuli and ambivalence toward women. This is a Mexican cultural and psychological perspective, as a Mexican masculine response to conquistador Spanish conquering of the Americas. It has been noted by some scholars that machismo was adopted as a form of control for the male body.  Criticism and controversy  = Controversy surrounding colonial connotations = There is controversy surrounding the concept of machismo as originally from Spanish and Portuguese descent. The use of Spanish and Portuguese produces historical colonial connotations through its promotion of Spanish and Portuguese masculine social construction, when the term should be used to describe specific Latin American historical masculinities.Mignolo, W. D. (2011). Local histories/global designs: Coloniality, subaltern knowledges, and border thinking. Princeton University Press.Alcof, L. M. (2005). Latino Vs Hispanic: The Politics of Ethnic Names. Philosophy & Social Criticism. 31(4). 395–407. However, the word machismo does resemble words in Spanish and Portuguese language which is the cause why it is often associated with Spain and Portugal. In addition, by identifying machismo as a form of Europeanness, it offers legitimacy to the concept of a wicked formed of the same Western hypermasculinity known to Protestant Reforme- derived cultures and subjugates Latin America's understanding of itself and its cultural history and peculiarities. For example, the use of and , to mean only the positive characteristics of machismo is imbued with feudal and colonial connotations relating to colonial power relations. This is because the origin of the word resides in feudal Spanish/Portuguese descriptions of landlords that reached through and into the colonial era, exaltsThobani, S. (2007).

It cannot be avoided in Portuguese as , the word for the more acceptable parts of machismo, is itself a loanword from Spanish presenting a palatalization process that Portuguese did not experience (the Portuguese word for a horseman is , and for horsemanship it has ). = Consequences of a one-sided negative depiction = Researchers are concerned regarding the unbalanced representation of machismo within Latin American cultures, and are now focused on creating a balanced representation. They have repeatedly pointed out the positive characteristics consistent with machismo, or : nurturance, protection of the family and its honor, dignity, wisdom, hard work, responsibility, spirituality, and emotional connectedness. Latin American scholars propose there are really two different constructs within machismo, one positive construct and one negative construct. The negative construct of machismo is based on the traditional Western concept of hypermasculinity. 's characteristics are exalted, while machismo's characteristics are seen as predominantly negative. The other side of machismo, the positive side (, ), refers to a connection to family and chivalry. However, the focus on the negative aspects and avoidance of the positive aspects of machismo coincides with the concept of marginalization and powerlessnessYoung, I. M. (2000). Five faces of oppression. In M. Adams, Readings for Diversity and Social Justice, pp. 35–49. New York : Routledge. of Hispanic and Latino, and more broadly Romance-speaking European culture-derived, narratives. This is because the focus on the negative aspects and the avoidance or ignorance of the positive creates a power dynamic that legitimizes the mainstream American hegemonic idea of masculinity as the correct or more righteous form of masculinity, and subjugates machismo as a degenerated form of abuse against women and backwardness. As a result, it can create a sense of powerlessness within Latino males in their expression of their masculinity.Connell, R. W. (1995). Masculinities. Los Angeles, California, United States: University of California PressMignolo, Walter D. Local histories/global designs: Coloniality, subaltern knowledges, and border thinking. Princeton University Press, 2011. The phenomena of gender-based belief systems having negative and positive effects is described as ambivalent sexism, which is made of hostile sexism and benevolent sexism. Academics have noted that there are consequences of only having a negative definition for Hispanic and Latino masculinity in popular literature. Researchers have suggested that, according to the anti- Catholic and/or Nordicist) views dominant in mainstream white American culture, Latin American manifestations of machismo represent \\"all that is wrong in a man\\".Adams, Carlos (2006). Machismo and Geographies of Hope. PhD dissertation. Program in American Studies, Washington State University Latino academics have used this argument to explain why Latino male youth struggle in academic institutions and have high rates of criminality.Caravantes, E. (2006). Clipping Their Own Wings: The Incompatibility Between Latino Culture and American Education. Hamilton Books These are the same discourses that argue that Latino masculinity (machismo) is defined by violence, recklessness, and misogyny. Accordingly, they link these expressions as contributing to a lack of interest in academics as well as behavioural struggles in schools for Latino male youth. =Negative depictions of machismo in popular literature= Throughout popular literature, the term has continued to be associated with negative characteristics, such as sexism, misogyny, chauvinism, hypermasculinity, and hegemonic masculinity.Anders, G. (1993). Machismo: Dead or alive? Hispanic, 3, 14–20. Scholars characterize macho men as violent, rude, womanizing, and prone to alcoholism. Authors from a various disciplines typified macho men as domineering through intimidation, seducing and controlling women and children through violence, intimidation and for the former sexuality. For example, in American literature, an example of machismo comes from Tennessee Williams' character Stanley Kowalski, an egotistical brother-in-law, from A Streetcar Named Desire. In the play (and 1951 film adaptation), Stanley epitomizes the tough, alpha-male (hypermasculine) archetype, socially and physically dominating and imposing his will upon his wife and her sister, Blanche Dubois. Bound up with Stanley's aggressive and occasionally misogynistic views is a strong sense of pride and honor which leads to his hatred of Blanche. In the play A View from the Bridge by Arthur Miller, one of the main characters, Eddie, is a classic type who displays machismo. He wants to be the best of the men around him and when beaten, becomes very agitated and increasingly irrational. The negative stereotypes depicted in American literature are not representative of all the different layers of machismo. Some societies and academics place traditional gender roles (social norms for certain communities, while admiration or convention for others) as the most important component of machismo.  Influences  Machismo has been influenced and supported by many different factors. The Catholic religion plays a vital role to many within the Spanish community. For this reason the male dominated world that is often referenced in the Bible is seen among the people. Examples can be found throughout the Bible showing how women should be submissive to their husbands: \\"Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire [shall be] to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee\\" (Genesis 3:16). The ideologies that the man is stronger, the moneymaker, and the protector all back up the mindset that wives must listen to their husbands. = Masculinity in context: Chile = The revolution of copper mining sets the tone of traditional masculinity. The industrious labor performed by the working class male is accredited by status amongst peers and ability to provide for the family. Men who work in the mines are often away from their families’ the majority of the time so they engage in homosociality. The homosocial leisure activities that the workers engage in consist of gambling, soccer, and alcohol. Women's presence in social settings is not prominent, so men's dominance and inevitable homosocial interactions create kinship and brotherhood. Exploitation of masculinity through the context of miners is prominent and embodied by Chilean males. Since 2007, every July the Red Chilena Contra la Violencia hacia las Mujeres (Chilean Network Against Violence Towards Women) implements its campaign \\"¡Cuidado! El Machismo Mata\\" (Beware! Machismo Kills) to raise awareness about violence against women, intrafamiliar violence and femicide. http://www.nomasviolenciacontramujeres.cl/cuidad-el-machismo-mata/ (Spanish)  Puerto Rican machismo and American cultural influences of gender equality  As a territory of the U.S., Puerto Rico tends to take on the same progressive movements as U.S. These movements include LGBTQ rights, minority rights, and equality. In regards to equality and what separates men and women, gender roles determine what is socially acceptable in different geographical areas. In Puerto Rico the machismo culture has or had a strong presence. Men were to work outside the home, manage the finances, and make the decisions. Women were to be subordinate to their husbands and be the homemakers. Women would often would have to be dependent on men for everything. Growing up boys are taught to the machismo code girls are taught the marianismo code. Machismo is a term originating in the early 1930s and 40s best defined as having masculinity and Pride. Machismo is a factor challenged among different groups due to how an ideal man is expected to be portrayed which builds pressure. Mentally men may feel the need to take up more opportunities to meet expectations, such as supporting the home, or maintaining employment leading to stress. This may also take a toll as physically well straining to be strong and overexerting the body, or the opposite of putting on weight by not having the desired physique and feeling inferior. This is further expressed through Puerto Ricans Americans outside the island.https://gabrielasofiaortiz.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/the- pertpetuation-of-machismo-in-puerto-rico.pdf However, the roles are beginning to shift as women's rights and equality movements sweep the mainland, Puerto Rico is beginning to feel the effects. While Puerto Ricans may be motivated by the progressive of the mainland they base their movements off of their situations in Puerto Rico. Beginning in the 1950s the employment rate for women began to rise as the employment rate fell due to the island's industrialization. Also, during the 1950s to 1980s the field of the white collar women emerged furthering the rise in women employment. However, women were not released from their homemaker duties because they had a job. In fact, women were now expected to contribute to the household's finances and be the homemaker. This caused a shift in what was acceptable in households. Men used to be able to come and go as they pleased as the women were dependent on them, however, after contributing to the household, acquiring more education, and being the homemaker women became more independent and conscious. They no longer tolerated poor men. This caused great inner conflict with the idea of the machismo culture. In present-day society this machismo culture is still oppressed as Puerto Rico in 2016 was the only place where women made more than men, at $1.03 for every $1. In Chicago where there is a big Puerto Rican community; Puerto Ricans are feeling threatened of their American dream. Young Puerto Rican women are expected to stay at home reproductively, as well as for the cultural reasons of productively being at home. There are rules made by Latin families that young women should not be influenced by the dangers of outside, for the portrayal of young women to be sexualized or vulnerable. They are raised with these strict rules because some women experience pregnancy at a young age, and are not familiar to care for both themselves nor the responsibilities of a new child. Young women may even lack support from their own household families, and are blamed for not being properly educated. Puerto Rican families influenced by American culture; may express to bend traditional rules. These families do what they believe is best for their family, and further educate about sexual education and learn while virginity is valued until marriage. LGBTQ community is also a conflicting issue to the machismo culture. Puerto Rico is known for its strong Christian community along with having a smaller Jewish and Muslim community as well. Due to changing times and influence from America the LGBTQ movement has been a strong force for equality, which in Puerto Rico has not always been accepted; and even harmed in the process due to difference. A new term to differentiate gender is Latinx, and Latine a variant used to pronounce easily throughout Latin America is a gender neutral form of addressing someone compared to the familiar male Latino or female Latina. Minorities are treated differently in Puerto Rico despite the blending of three races. Puerto Ricans face racism amongst themselves in their community and at work solely based on their color of their skin. People with even the slightest pigment were not considered white, and segregation exist within the island; where minorities may live in different regions of the island with others of color. Therefore, the pre-Columbian use of the word macho had to do with wisdom and leadership that was worthy of imitation, while gender was not involved. When the Spanish came, their use of the word was strictly masculine. Therefore, after the Spanish invasion a new word, idea and concept was born: that a macho was a masculine leader, who was enlightened and worthy of imitation. It was always a positive term. Therefore, in Mexico, the use of the word macho may provoke confusion if it is not used precisely or in context.Rémi, Siméon. Diccionario de la lengua náhuatl o mexicana. Siglo XXI Editores, S.A. de C.V., 2004. pp. 246, 258 . Macho: distinguished, illustrious, ... as a passive voice of Mati: uel macho ó nouian macho, evident, well known, notorious; qualli ipam macho, he is good, well behaved.  Machismo in Cuba  = Early Beginnings = Machismo is a source of pride for men and they must prove their manliness by upholding their dominance in their reputation and their household. Machismo comes from the assertion of male dominance in everyday life. Examples of this would be men dominating their wives, controlling their children, and demanding the utmost respect from others in the household. Machismo has become deeply woven in Cuban society and have created barriers for women to reach full equality. The reason for this is the patriarchy that runs high in Cuban society. Cuba's patriarchal society stems from the fact that Spain has had a history of using brutal war tactics and humiliation as a means to keep and establish their power. Tomas de Torquemada, who ruled as a grand inquisitor under King Ferdinand and Queen Elizabeth of Spain, used degrading and humiliating forms of torture to get information out of prisoners. Men like Torquemada create the domino effect throughout history of repressive and toxic masculinity that has plagued Cuban society. In Uva de Aragon Clavijo's, novel El Caiman Ante El Espejo , Clavijo claims that Cubans feel more power from the genital organs of past male Cuban leaders like Fidel Castro. Even though he represented a revolution, he was still a powerful and dominating man who ruled over the people. In the point of view of Clavijo, militarism and caudillismo, are what is to blame for Cuban machismo, as it established the ideology of the \\"leadership of the strongman\\" which proved to be successful in Castro becoming victorious in his revolution. Thus furthering that a male dominated political society is superior. Despite Castro's leading a socialist revolution, it only seems to reinforce macho-control over the Cuban people, specifically for Cuban woman who have yet to occupy any established political positions. The idea of the male ego, where the male is symbolized as \\"hyper-masculine, virile, strong, paternalistic, sexually dominant, and the financial provider\\" is reinforced by the teachings of the Catholic Church, the main religion practiced in Cuba and Latina America in general. According to Catholic Church teachings, the female should be a virgin but it's less important for the male to be one. During colonial times, a female's chastity and demureness were linked to the family's societal standings [new], while the males were expected and sometimes pressured into proving their sexual prowess by having multiple partners. There was a duality in the expression of love. Men were supposed to express between physical loves, while women were expected to only express spiritual love and romantic love. Even after marriage, carnal love was frowned upon if the woman expressed it too vigorously, instead she was more delighted by the romantic expression of the love. = Cuban Machismo and its Effect on Women and LGBT Community. = Because of the objectification of women, domestic violence often ignored when women decide to seek help from the police. Domestic abuse victims are given psychological counseling as a way to cope with their trauma, but little is done criminally to solve the problem. Domestic Abuse cases or other violent crimes committed against women, are very rarely reported on by the media,Gender Equality and the Role of Women in Cuban Society. 2011. Website. 5 December 2018. and the government does not release statistics that show the people the extent of the crimes. The Cuban Revolution changed some of the ways the people of Cuba viewed women. Fidel Castro in his own words saw that the women were going through ‘a revolution within the revolution, and established the Federation of Cuban Women (FMC). This organization, headed by Vilma Espin, Castro's sister in law, helped women establish themselves better into the working world and in women's right issues. The FMC has continually advocated for women rights and in 1997 created the Grupo Nacional para la Prevencion y Atencion de la Violencia Familiar, a national group whose purpose is to study and find measures on how to get help for the women who fall victim to domestic violence. With the help of the FMC and the Grupo Nacional para la Prevencion y Atencion de la Violencia Familiar, women can file claims against their abusers at the Office of Victim Rights. They are also now able to get access to sexual abuse therapies. This by no way solves the issue of domestic abuse, but it is a turning point for the Cuban women who are now no longer feel powerless in the fight. Because Machismo is so entrenched into the very systems that keep women oppressed, women in Cuba don't hold political or monetary positions of power. While there are 48.9% of women in Cuban Congress, the political group that holds the most power is The Cuban Communist Party, which is made up of only 7% of women. In many cases, women who do have professional jobs are often funded by the Cuban state meaning they only receive about $30 a month. This means that women are employed but do not and cannot hold positions of power due to the men in power who benefit from staying in power. Machismo is mostly ingrained in domestic environments, so while 89% of women over 25 have received a secondary education, if a woman is a doctor, or a lawyer even after all the work she has done during the day, at home she is still expected to cook and clean and be the primary caretaker of the children. Many feminist scholars have described this phenomenon, which takes place in other cultures, as the second shift, based on a book by Arlie Russell Hochschild by the same name.Hochschild, Arlie and Anne Machung. The Second Shift. New York: Avon Books, 1990. Cuban males see no problem in leaving all the housework to their wives while they are allowed to go out for drinks with their friends. Machismo characteristics in men have given them power over women in the home, which leaves certain women more vulnerable to domestic violence committed against them. Cubans are now beginning to leave state employment, to search for jobs in tourism. These jobs produce a great deal of profit because of the wealthy tourists that visit the island and leave good tips. Cubans who were once professors and doctors are now leaving their old jobs to become bartenders and drive cabs From the inception of machismo from both the Spanish Empire and Portuguese Empire, machismo translates to mean ‘macho’ and refers to male oppression over women. Moreover, machismo is an all-encompassing term for the dominion of the elite man over ‘the other’. In this case ‘the other’ refers to women of all races and economic status, whom the macho sees as an object to protect. in contrast effeminate and gay men aren't seen as worthy of protection but as objects to ridicule and punish sometimes with violence. Men who do not perform their gender in the \\"normalized\\" way are referred to as ‘maricon’, (a derogatory word meaning queer or fag), because their maleness is being called into question. Many of the anti-LGBT acceptance stems from The Cuban Revolution and Fidel Castro who had strong views over masculinity and how it fit in his idea of militarism. Fidel Castro once said on homosexuality in a 1965 interview with American journalist Lee Lockwood, \\"A deviation of that nature clashes with the concept we have of what a militant communist should be.\\" That same year gay men in Cuba were being sent to labor camps because their sexuality made them \\"un-fit\\" to be involved in military service. Machismo has not only been a tool used to control women but also to punish men who do not adhere to societal norms, should behave as well. However, in the more recent years, the establishment of CENESEX (National Centre for Sexual Education) has been established so that the population of Cuba can more readily accept sexual diversity of all kinds, especially in terms of the LGBT people. CENESEX has grown in part because of the Cuban government and with the help Mariela Castro-Espin, daughter of Raul Castro, 16th president of Cuba, and niece to Fidel Castro. CENESEX has sought to decrease homophobia in Cuba by increasing sexual awareness by holding social gatherings like anti homophobic rallies. = Cuban Machismo in the Media = In 1975, a new Cuban Law came onto the island: the Codigo de la Familia (Family Law). It was put into effect on March 8, 1975, 15 years after the Cuban Revolution. The new Family Law of 1975 really helped a lot of women get jobs on the island and provided children with protection under the law so that child begging and homelessness amongst children was practically eradicated. The law also stated that it was required for both sexes to participated in domestic chores But just because the law was passed, does not mean it was heavily reinforced, particularly in the domestic sphere. One of the aspects of the new family law was not only to create equality outside of the home but inside of it as well. This new family law was not received well by many people in Cuba. And many people backlashed against the law. These grievances reflected in the media that was made in Cuba, particularly, during the \\"Golden Age of Cuban Cinema\\".  Closer Look: Hasta Cierto Punto, 1983 (Up to A Certain Point, 1983)  Hasta Cierto Punto directed by Tomás Gutiérrez Alea is a movie that follows Oscar, an educated playwright who writes a movie on the effects of machismo in Cuban Society. In the opening scene of this movie, there is an interview with a young black man who is asked about machismo. The young man laughs and says in the movie, \\"Oh, they've managed to change my attitudes on that score; I'm certainly changed up to a certain point. I’ve probably changed up to 80% now. Maybe they can work on me and change me to 87%. But they will never, never get me up to 100%, no way!\\" These attitudes on-screen reflect that of many men in Cuba and their attitudes towards women having more equality in everyday life. The film that Oscar was meant to write for is directed by his friend Arturo. Both are well- educated men with stable careers in their fields, wives, cars, and other luxuries. However, Arturo believes that the issue of Machismo is most directly a working class problem and that it is up to educated men such as himself and Oscar, to raise consciousness on the issue. Oscar and Arturo use working-class dock-workers to use as research for their film. This is where they meet Lina, a working-class woman who is in charge of the dock workers. At the beginning of the film she is represented to be tough on her workers and is well respected amongst all the men she works with. Oscar, the screenwriter, finds himself enamored with her tough attitudes, which is very different than women he has met before. However, as the movie goes on, we see Oscar increasingly find himself frustrated with Lina's free spirit and working-class \\"down-to- earth\\" personality. Oscar sees that this is not the kind of woman he is used to. Throughout the movie, although Oscar is having an affair with his wife, he finds himself being more empathetic to working-class struggles in a way that his friend Arturo isn't. Arturo still believes that all working-class men are just \\"macho brutes\\" The film's dynamic on working class and bourgeois machismo is very telling of Cuban society and how class reflects on the attitudes towards machismo. It also problematizes, bourgeois men who believe they are intellectually above everyone else, including issues on machismo and women's equality.  Implications  = Generational cycle = Some people identify that machismo is perpetuated through the pressure to raise children a certain way and instill social constructions of gender throughout a child's development. This is complemented by the distant father-son relationship in which intimacy and affection are typically avoided. These aspects set up the environment through which the ideology perpetuates itself. It creates a sense of inferiority that drives boys to reach an unattainable level of masculinity, a pursuit often validated by the aggressive and apathetic behavior they observe in the men around them and ultimately leading them to continue the cycle. = Mental health = There is accumulating evidence that supports the relation between the way men are traditionally socialized to be masculine and its harmful mental and physical health consequences. Respectively, machismo, is sociocultural term associated with male and female socialization in Hispanic cultures; it is a set of values, attitudes and beliefs about masculinity. Although the construct of machismo holds both positive and negative aspects of masculinity, emerging research suggests the gender role conceptualization of machismo has associations with negative cognitive- emotional factors (i.e., depression symptoms; trait anxiety and anger; cynical hostility) among Hispanic populations. Similarly, a well-documented disparity notes Latino adolescents reporting higher levels of depression than other ethnic backgrounds. Research suggests this may be associated to adolescent perceived gender role discrepancies which challenge the traditional perceptions of gender role (i.e., machismo). Enhanced understanding on associations between the gender role conceptualizations of machismo with negative cognitive-emotional factors may prove invaluable to mental health professionals. According to Fragoso and Kashubeck, \\"if a therapist notes that a client seems to endorse high levels of machismo, that therapist might explore whether the client is experiencing high levels of stress and depression\\". Therefore, \\"conducting a gender role assessment would help a therapist assess a client's level of machismo and whether aspects of gender role conflict are present\\". Many counseling psychologists are interested in further studies for comprehending the connection between counseling for males and topics such as sex-role conflicts and male socialization. This high demand stems from such psychologists' abilities to make patients aware how some inflexible and pre-established ideals regarding sex-roles may be detrimental to people's way of regarding new changes in societal expectancies, fostering relationships, and physical and mental health. Professionals such as Thomas Skovholt, psychology professor at the University of Minnesota, claim that more research needs to be done in order to have efficient mediation for men through counseling. Several elements of machismo are considered psychologically harmful for men. Competition is a widely talked about subject in this area, as studies show that there are both positive and negative connotations to it. Many benefits arise from healthy competition such as team-building abilities, active engagement, pressure handling, critical thinking, and the strive to excel. As these qualities and traits are highly valued by many, they are widely taught to children from a young age both at school and at home. Scholars also argue that men could be mentally harmed from competition, such as the one experienced by many at their job, as their impetus to rise above their peers and fulfill the breadwinner concept in many societies can cause stress, jealousy, and psychological strain. = Negative implications =  Violence  \\"Machismo as a cultural factor is substantially associated with crime, violence, and lawlessness independently of the structural control variables\\" (26-27). One key aspect of Machismo's association to violence is its influence in a man's behavior towards proving his strength (57). While strength and fortitude are recognized as key components to the stereotype of machismo, demonstrations of violence and aggressive actions have become almost expected of men and have been justified as desirable products of being tough and macho. It can be implied that \\"if you are violent, you are strong and thus more of a man than those who back down or do not fight\\". Violent encounters can stem from the desire to protect his family, friends, and particularly his female relatives that are vulnerable to the machismo actions of other men, (59). However, through jealousy, competitiveness, and pride, violent encounters are also often pursued to demonstrate his strength to others. A man's insecurities can be fueled by a number of pressures. These range from societal pressures to \\"be a man\\" to internal pressures of overcoming an inferiority complex, (59). This can translate into actions that devalue feminine characteristics and overemphasize the characteristics of strength and superiority attributed to masculinity, (59).  Domestic/sexual violence  In many cases, a man's position of superiority over a female partner can lead him to gain control over different aspects of her life. Since women are viewed as subservient to men in many cultures, men often have power to decide whether his wife can work, study, socialize, participate in the community, or even leave the house. With little opportunity for attaining an income, minimal means to get an education, and the few people they have as a support system, many women become dependent on their husbands financially and emotionally. This leaves many women particularly vulnerable to domestic violence both because it is justified through this belief that men are superior and thus are free to express that superiority and because women cannot leave such an abusive relationship since they rely on their husbands to live.  Gender roles  The power difference in the relationship between a man and a woman not only creates the social norm of machismo, but by consequence also creates the social concept of marianismo. which is the idea that women are meant to be pure and wholesome. Marianismo derives its origins from Spanish Colonization, as many social constructs from Latin America do. It emphasizes the perfect femininity of a woman and her virginity. One could argue that in the similar manner of Patriarchy, the man is the head of the household while the \\"fragile\\" woman is submissive and tends to remain behind the scenes. This brings to focus the idea that women are inferior and are thus dependent on their husbands. As a result, they not only rely on their husbands for financial support, but in the social realm are put at the same level as \\"children under age 12, mentally ill persons, and spendthrifts\\" (265). By way of tradition, not only are women given limited opportunities in what they are able to do and to be, but they are also viewed as people that cannot even take care of themselves. Getting married provides a woman with security under her husband's success, but also entails a lifelong commitment towards serving her husband and her children. While social pressures and expectations play huge roles in the perpetuation of the marianismo construct, this ideology is also taught to girls as they grow up. They learn the importance of performing domestic labor and household chores, such as cooking and cleaning, because this will be the role they will play in their future families. They are taught that these must be done well so that they can adequately serve their families and avoid punishment and discipline by their authoritative husbands. Some experts hypothesize, since there is a lack of empirical research on gender-role conflicts, that men might suffer from such conflicts because of their fear of femininity. Professionals from several universities in the United States developed a model around this hypothesis with six behavioral patterns. # Restrictive emotionality: restraining oneself from expressing feelings or not allowing others to express their feelings. # Homophobia: the fear of homosexuals or the fear of being a homosexual, not limited to all the stereotypes associated with that. # Socialized control, power, and competition: The desire for the authority of being in charge of the situation, commanding others, and to excel above others. # Restrictive sexual and affectional behavior: Showing little to no affection or sexuality to others. # Obsession with achievement and success: having an ongoing complex that accomplishment, work, and illustriousness constitutes one's value. # Health problems: unhealthy diet, stress levels, and lifestyle. The model was developed around the idea that these six patterns are all influenced by men's the fear of femininity. This theory was then partially supported by a study done by five professionals. Some tools already created to measure gender-role attitudes include the Personal Attitudes Questionnaire, the Bem Sex Role Inventory, the Attitudes Toward Women Scale, and the Attitudes Toward the Male's Role Scale. Evidence suggests that gender-roles conflicts inflicted by machismo can lead males who were raised with this mentality and or live in a society in which machismo is prevalent to suffer high levels of anxiety and low self-esteem. Additionally, studies found that many males facing such conflicts are subject to experience anger, depression, and substance abuse.  Sexually-transmitted infections  One implication of the Machismo concept is the pressure for a man to be sexually experienced. Male infidelity is of common practice in many cultures, as men are not as expected to hold nearly the same level of chastity as women are. Meanwhile, girls are oftentimes brought up to tolerate an unfaithful partner, since it is a part of the machismo culture. As such, this puts populations at risk for transmitting STIs as men seek out multiple sexual partners with little interference from their wives or from society. The risk is further heightened by the lack of condom use by men who are both miseducated about the effectiveness of a condom's protection against STIs and the belief that this wouldn't happen to them. This mentality also deters men from getting themselves tested to know if they are HIV-positive, which leads them to even spread STIs without even knowing it.  Sexuality and sexual orientation  For men in many Latin American countries, their perceived level of masculinity determines the amount of respect they receive in society. Because homosexual men are associated with feminine attributes, they are perceived with lower level of masculinity, and as a result, they receive less respect than heterosexual men in society. This, in turn, can limit their \\"ability to achieve upward social mobility, to be taken seriously, or to hold positions of power\\". Also, because homosexuality is seen as taboo or even sinful in many Christian denominations, homosexual men tend to lack a support system, leaving many unable express their true sexuality. To deal with such oppression, they must make the choice either to conform to heteronormativity and repress their homosexual identity, to assimilate towards masculine ideals and practices while maintaining their homosexual identity in private, or to openly express their homosexuality and suffer ostracization from society. This creates a hierarchy of homosexuality corresponding to how much \\"respect, power, and social standing\\" a homosexual man can expect to receive. The more a man acts in accordance with the stereotypical heterosexual hegemonic masculinity, the higher on the social hierarchy they are. On the lower end of the hierarchy are the locas or maricones. These men are those that are deemed as effeminate because they do not live by the social construct of hegemonic masculinity and also publicize their homosexuality. As such, they receive little respect both in society in general and among the LGBT community. Many homosexual men resist being associated with the \\"loca\\" stereotype by either demonstrating overt masculinity or by ridiculing and distancing themselves from other \\"loca\\" men. A common Puerto Rican saying demonstrates this resistance: \\"mejor un drogadicto que un pato\\" (better a drug addict than a faggot). Homosexuality is perceived as negative or weak within the machista ideal. It doesn't fit into the masculine attributes that machismo extols. This often leads homosexual or bisexual men living in machista communities to be reluctant about being open about their sexuality because of the negative connotation associated with it. Familismo, which is an idea in Latin cultures that ties an individual with a commitment to his or her family, and homophobia can sometimes cause in homosexual individuals the repression of sexual identity, family separation, and to hide their sexuality. Such situations may hinder personal shame and secret sexual actions that increases HIV and STI risk in Latino homosexuals. Regularly experiencing homophobia and low self-esteem have a connection with sexual risk. A survey conducted by the Virginia Commonwealth University found that men who had high machismo values or characteristics were more than five times more probable to participate in activities or behave in a way to put them at risk for contracting HIV or an STI. Because of the negative connotations that come with identifying as homosexual, the definition of homosexuality has become ambiguous. By genderizing sexual practices, only men who are sexually penetrated during sex, locas are considered homosexual while men who are the sexual penetrators during sex can maintain their heterosexual identity. Also, in many Latin American countries, the media portrayal of homosexual men often play into the stereotype of an effeminate, flamboyant male role. As a result, the idea of a masculine homosexual man remains almost unheard of and privatized by the community and by society, which allows this stereotype of homosexual men as locas to persist. = Positive implications =  Altruism  Machismo can also pressure men to defend the well-being of his loved ones, his community, and his country. It allows him to perform altruistic acts in order to provide protection to others. In the past, and even in many current societies where people rely on subsistence agriculture and economy to survive, machismo helped provide men with the courage to drive off potential threats to protect his land and his crop. Today, this contributes to the substantial gender gap in the makeup of military and armed forces around the world, even considering growing female representation in the military today. Beyond the realm of the armed forces, however, the machismo ideology can also drive men to work towards service because he is in a \\"superior\\" position, which enables him to demonstrate his success by offering his own strengths to help others. Their dependence on him can validate his ego and help maintain this difference in power. Another approach to machismo is that of the \\"caballerismo\\" ideology, that because a man is the head of the household, he is responsible for the well-being of the members of his family. This describes the call for a man to be chivalrous, nurturing, and protective of his loved ones. It translates to the belief that a true man would never act violent towards his wife or children, but would instead ensure that no harm come to them. Machismo, seen through this approach, inspires men to create \\"harmonious interpersonal relationships through respect for self and others\\". This allows fathers to maintain positive, intimate relationships with his children and share a more egalitarian relationship with his wife.  Men and work  In many cultures in the world, there is a long-standing tradition that the man is the head of the household and is responsible for providing for the family. In some cases, this may mean he is the only parent working in paid-work while in other conditions this may mean both parents are working but the man is expected to be the primary income contributor. In either case, part of the masculine identity and his self-respect is defined by his ability to provide for his family. If he is unable to do so, or if he brings home less money than that of his wife, his position as head of the family is challenged. In some cultures, this may mean ultimate shame for him if he cannot fulfill this role: \\"that being unable to find work meant that 'there is no recognition even to [his] humanity] ... Those who do not work are like dead people'\\" (212). Beyond providing economic support for his family, a man engaging in paid-work is seen as honorable because he is sacrificing time and energy that he could be spending with his family. These are costs that cannot be repaid and thus are a priceless investment on his part towards the well-being of his family unit.  Ancient History  Although culture may present homophobia, misogyny and masculinity as innately bundled together, history presents different models of masculinity Masculinity was part of homosexuality in ancient Greece. Neither was it all misogyny. Goddesses were worshiped in temples, and the female poet Sappho wrote of Lesbian love. In ancient times, women too had their share of machismo-like vices, and virtues. The lore of the Amazons tells of women heroically fighting as defenders in the Trojan War, and according to National Geographic, \\"Archaeology shows that these fierce women also smoked pot, got tattoos, killed and loved men.\\"https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/10/141029-amazons- scythians-hunger-games-herodotus-ice-princess-tattoo-cannabis/ Homosexual- machismo helped thwart Sparta's power hold over ancient Greek city-states: In 371BC the Sacred Band of Thebes was an elite fighting unit composed of 150 homosexual male pairs. They were credited with helping remove Sparta's military domination, and their actions were linked to the spread of Western culture: Theban General Epaminondas taught Philip II of Macedon military tactics and diplomacy used to reunify the Greeks under Macedonia. His son Alexander the Great was credited with the Hellenization of Persia, Egypt and Jerusalem in 332BC. The Greeks had the Hebrew scriptures translated into the Septuagint, fostering the spread of Judaism throughout the region. Alexander & Hephaestion had been heavily influenced by Homer's Iliad, particularly the masculine love between Achilles & Patroclus. They paired themselves as their modern incarnation, nearly a millennium after the Trojan War. Later, the Roman Empire shared a degree of homosexuality alongside the virtues of masculinity. In 19BC, Virgil's epic poem Aeneid contributed to the folklore of Rome, while depicting the love of fellow warriors Nisus & Euryalus. In 128AD the love of Emperor Hadrian & Antinous was celebrated in the public. Back in Hebrew culture, in 1006BC,http://livingstonesclass.org/Archive/DavidChronologyGross.pdf the covenant between David & Jonathan was recorded in the Books of Samuel.1 Samuel 8.3 and 2 Samuel 1.26 Gradually, the Septuagint would be expanded with new Greek books, eventually forming Christian Bibles, the earliest extant versions being the Codex Vaticanus and Codex Sinaiticus from 300AD-360AD. = Tradeoffs = Machismo changes some dynamics of life in a way have both positive and negative effects. For example, machismo grants women authority in the home but at the expense of a man's relationship to his children and work related stress having worked long hours.  Female respect and responsibility  In the traditional household, the man is expected to work and provide for his family while his wife stays home to care for the children. As such, fathers are seen as a distant authority figure to his children while mothers assume the majority of responsibility in this domestic realm and thus gain agency and the ultimate respect of her children. With the rise of female power, decisions in the household can take on a more egalitarian approach, where mothers can have equal say in the household. Meanwhile, the machismo mentality in men as a provider and protector of the family can inspire him to persevere through challenges introduced by work. \\"Within each of our memories there Is the Image of a father who worked long hours, suffered to keep his family alive, united, and who struggled to maintain his dignity. Such a man had little time for concern over his \\"masculinity\\". Certainly he did not have ten children because of his machismo, but because he was a human being, poor, and without \\"access\\" to birth control.\\" \\"Machismo ideology is as beneficial to women in that it encourages their husbands to provide for and protect them and their children. Further, by subordinating their needs to those of their family, women earn a lifetime of support from their husbands and children and in this way gain some control in the family\\" (90). Because fathers are typically more invested in paid labor, mothers typically spend more time with the children and thus gain credibility in important decisions such as a child's schooling or a child's health care. Nevertheless, in these machist households the fathers will have the last word whenever they choose to, as they are the breadwinners, and all the family ultimately depends on them for survival. In case of a separation or divorce, it is typically the mothers who suffer the most, since they did not invest their time in their career, and will probably still have to provide and care for the children.  Prevalence and acculturation in the 21st century  Despite machismo's documented history in Hispanic and Latin American communities, research throughout the years has shown a shift in prevalence among younger generations. In Brazil, researchers found that while the majority of young men interviewed held traditional attitudes on gender roles and machismo, there was a small sample of men that did not agree with these views. Macho attitudes still prevail, the values place women into a lower standard. Acculturation and education have been proposed to be a factor in how machismo is passed down through Hispanic and Latino generations in the United States. According to researchers who measured self-reported levels of machismo among 72 university students, 37 whom identified as Hispanic, the \\"somewhat unique population of college-educated students who have been heavily influence[d] by egalitarian attitudes, values, and norms\\" may explain why ethnicity did not directly predict machismo attitudes in two studies. Because education and acculturation of American values in Latino individuals may result in the development of attitudes supporting gender-equality, this demonstrates how machismo may gradually decline over time in the United States. Moreover, researchers analyzed a large cross-sectional survey among 36 countries, including 6 Latin American countries, from 2009 and discovered countries with less gender inequality had adolescents that supported attitudes of gender-equality, though females were more likely to support LGBT and non- traditional genders than males. While the mean score of gender-equality attitudes was 49.83, with lower scores indicating less gender equality attitudes, Latin American countries scored the following: Chile (51.554), Colombia (49.416), Dominican Republic (43.586), Guatemala (48.890), Mexico (45.596), Paraguay (48.370). Machismo is associated with gender inequality. Therefore, this study suggests that Latino individuals living in their native countries may support more machismo attitudes than Latino immigrants adopting U.S. values of gender equality. Masuda also studied self-reported measures of sexual relationship power among 40 recently immigrated Latino couples found data against machismo attitudes since women perceived themselves to have greater control and decision-making roles in their relationships. This serves as a stark contrast because machismo traditionally creates a relationship dynamic that relegates women to submissive roles and men to dominant roles. Again, acculturation may play a role in this dynamic shift because the couples averaged about 8 years since immigrating to the United States. Acculturation has not only been associated with a decline in machismo, it has appeared to affect how it manifests and how it is transferred through generations. Recently, Mexican American adolescents in romantic relationships demonstrated \\"adaptive machismo\\", which consist of the positive qualities of machismo, such as \\"emotional availability, demonstrations of affection, desire to financially care for a female partner, responsibility in child-rearing, and/or to the community or friends\\", during conflict resolution scenarios. Furthermore, while Mexican American adolescent males were found to have certain values and attitudes, such as caballerismo, passed down by their families, machismo was not one of them. Because families are not teaching machismo, this implies that it may be learned from sources separate from the family unit, such as peers and the media. Ultimately, these findings suggest that machismo is changing in terms of its prevalence, manifestation, and socialization.  Activism around machismo  = Young Lords = Founded in 1969, the Young Lords were an organization of Puerto Rican revolutionary nationalists in Chicago and New York City.Enck-Wanzer, Darrel (2010). The Young Lords: A Reader. New York and London: New York University Press. . pg. 10 Working toward the liberation of all oppressed people, the Young Lords opposed racism, capitalism, and assimilationist ideologies.Enck-Wanzer, Darrel (2010). The Young Lords: A Reader. New York and London: New York University Press. . pg. 9-13 Seeking self-determination and community control of institutions and land, the organization's leaders made a distinct choice to denounce machismo in their revised 13-Point Program and Platform. Previously reading, \\"We want equality for women. Machismo must be revolutionary... Not oppressive.\\", the organization moved toward a more radical position, stating \\"We want equality for women. Down with machismo and male chauvinism\\".Palante 8 May 1970, volume 2, number 2 This revised version of the organization's ideological platform was published in their newspaper, Palante in November 1970 - thirteen months following the original platform's publication in October 1969. The Young Lords opposed machismo because, as member Gloria González articulated in her 1971 Palante editorial, it serves to divide members of their movement.Palante, June 1971, volume 2, number 11 Further, the organization believed machismo serves as an extension of capitalism, a system they opposed. They understood the division of labor, including both reproductive labor and productive labor, to perpetuate the marginalization of women. They also understood the sexual objectification of women to be problematic and damaging to potentially revolutionary leaders. Moving toward this platform, however, would not have been possible without the Women of the Young Lords who pressured the organization's leadership to reject machismo during their East Coast Regional Central Committee retreat in May 1970.Enck-Wanzer, Darrel (2010). The Young Lords: A Reader. New York and London: New York University Press. . pg. 33 At this retreat the group studied and theorized, formally denouncing machismo because if power was to be transferred to the people, it would have to be the hands of all the people; and if this were to be possible, the Young Lords must reject \\"attitudes of superiority that brothers had towards sisters\\" and the \\"passivity of sisters toward brothers (allowing brothers to come out of a macho or chauvinist, superior bag)\\".Enck-Wanzer, Darrel (2010).

The episode premiered on the Fox network on November 16, 2004. It introduces the character of Dr. Gregory House (played by Hugh Laurie)—a maverick antisocial doctor—and his team of diagnosticians at the fictional Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital in New Jersey. The episode features House's attempts to diagnose a kindergarten teacher after she collapses in class. House was created by David Shore, who got the idea for the misanthropic title character from a doctor's visit. Initially, producer Bryan Singer wanted an American to play House, but British actor Hugh Laurie's audition convinced him that a foreign actor could play the role. Shore wrote House as a character with parallels to Sherlock Holmes—both are drug users, blunt, and close to being friendless. The show's producers wanted House handicapped in some way and gave the character a damaged leg arising from an improper diagnosis. The episode received generally positive reviews; the character of House was widely noted as a unique aspect of the episode and series, though some reviewers believed that such a cruel character would not be tolerated in real life. Other complaints with the episode included stereotyped supporting characters and an implausible premise. The initial broadcast of \\"Pilot\\" was watched by approximately seven million viewers, making it the 62nd-most-watched show of the week.  Plot  Shortly after the start of class, kindergarten teacher Rebecca Adler becomes dysphasic and experiences seizures. Dr. James Wilson attempts to convince Gregory House to treat Adler, but House initially dismisses him, believing that the case would be boring. Hospital administrator Dr. Lisa Cuddy approaches House in the elevator and attempts to persuade him to fulfill his duties at the hospital's walk-in clinic. House refuses, claiming that Cuddy cannot fire him due to tenure, and hurriedly leaves. When House's team attempts to perform an MRI on Adler, they discover that House's authorization for diagnostics has been revoked; Cuddy restores his authorization in exchange for his working at the clinic. Adler's throat closes up during the MRI due to an allergic reaction to gadolinium, prompting two members of House's team, Dr. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer) and Dr. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), to perform a tracheotomy. In the hospital's clinic, House's first patient is a man who is orange because of an over-consumption of carrots and vitamins (niacin). House also treats a ten-year-old boy whose mother allows him to use his asthmatic inhaler only intermittently instead of daily as prescribed. House criticizes the mother for making such a drastic medical decision without first learning more about asthma. During his monologue, House stumbles on an idea and leaves quickly to treat Adler; he diagnoses her with cerebral vasculitis, despite having no proof. House treats Adler with steroids, which improves her condition greatly for a time, until she starts seizing and has heart failure. On House's insistence, neurologist Dr. Eric Foreman and Cameron break into Adler's house to find anything that might account for Adler's symptoms. They find an opened package of ham in Adler's kitchen and House concludes that she is suffering from neurocysticercosis from eating undercooked pork at some point in her past. Adler refuses to accept more random treatments unless there is conclusive evidence that the diagnosis is correct. House is ready to dismiss the case when Chase provides an idea for noninvasive evidence of Adler's tapeworm infection; by taking an X-ray of her thigh, House proves that Adler is infested with other tapeworms and her condition is treatable. After seeing the evidence, Adler agrees to take her medication to kill the tapeworms.  Production  = Conception and filming = Series creator David Shore wrote the pilot with a vivid memory of a doctor's visit. Series creator David Shore traced the concept for House to his background as a patient at a teaching hospital. Shore recalled that \\"I knew, as soon as I left the room, they would be mocking me relentlessly [for my cluelessness...] and I thought that it would be interesting to see a character who actually did that before they left the room.\\" In 2004, Shore and executive producers Katie Jacobs and Paul Attanasio pitched House to Fox as a medical detective show--a hospital whodunit where the doctors would be the sleuths looking for the source of symptoms. The ideas behind House's character were added after Fox bought the show. Shore wrote the pilot with a vivid memory of a doctor's visit: he once had to wait two weeks to get a doctor's appointment for a sore hip, by which point his pain had disappeared. Nevertheless, Shore stated that the doctors were \\"incredibly polite\\". Shore later stated that, as he wrote the pilot, he fell in love with a character who, as a doctor, would actually ask \\"Why am I wasting your time?\\". A central part of the show's premise was that the main character would be handicapped. The initial idea was for House to use a wheelchair, but Fox turned down this interpretation (for which the crew was later grateful). The wheelchair idea turned into a scar on House's face, which later turned into a bad leg necessitating use of a cane. The original script called for House to be 34 years old; however, Shore later explained that he did not want the character to be that young. The episode was written by the series creator David Shore, and was shot in Canada; later episodes would be shot on soundstages in California. Shore said that the writings of Berton Roueché, a The New Yorker staff writer who chronicled intriguing medical cases, inspired the plots for \\"Pilot\\" and other early episodes. = Casting = Producer Bryan Singer initially thought actor Hugh Laurie was American. Producer Bryan Singer originally demanded that an American actor play the role of House; according to Singer, the more foreign actors he watched audition for the part, the more sure he was that an American was needed. At the time of casting, Hugh Laurie was filming the movie Flight of the Phoenix. He put together an audition tape in a Namibian hotel bathroom, the only place with enough light, and apologized for its appearance (which Singer compared to a \\"bin Laden video\\"). Laurie improvised by using an umbrella for a cane. Singer was impressed by Laurie's performance and commented on how well the \\"American actor\\" grasped the character, not realizing Laurie was British. Laurie initially believed that House was merely the \\"sidekick\\" of Wilson, because the script referred to Wilson as a doctor with \\"boyish\\" looks. Laurie did not realize that House was the protagonist until he read the full teleplay. According to Shore, \\"it's easy to make an asshole character unlikable. What's tricky is to make them watchable. And Hugh came in and brought everything that was there to the part, the nastiness, the not politically correct stuff. And yet you wanted to watch him, you wanted to spend time with him.\\" Similarities between House and the famous fictional detective Sherlock Holmes appear in the pilot; Shore explained that he was always a fan of Holmes, and found the character's traits of indifference to his clients unique. House and Holmes have only one real friend (Wilson and Watson, respectively) who connects the cerebral hero to human concerns. This Holmes and Watson dynamic was something the producers were looking for in the characters of House and Wilson, especially in terms of chemistry. Robert Sean Leonard (Dr. James Wilson) read the pilot scripts to Numb3rs and was planning to audition for the part, but was drawn to auditioning for House because he enjoyed the role of being \\"the guy [the protagonist] counts on\\", as well as the similarities to Sherlock Holmes. Leonard felt he did not audition well, and thought his long friendship with Singer helped land him the role. When asked in an interview why his character would ever be friends with House, Leonard replied: Australian actor Jesse Spencer's agent suggested that Spencer audition for the role of Chase, but he was hesitant, fearing the show might be similar to General Hospital. Once the actor saw the scripts, he changed his mind; Spencer then persuaded the producers to change his character into an Australian. Omar Epps, who plays Foreman, found influence from his work as a troubled intern on the TV show ER. Epps and co-star Jennifer Morrison read the scripts and believed that the show would be either a hit or miss.  Reception  Houses premiere episode was generally well received. Critics reacted positively to the character of House; Tom Shales of The Washington Post called him \\"the most electrifying character to hit television in years\\". The New York Magazine called the series \\"medical TV at its most satisfying and basic\\", and stated that the cast consisted of \\"[professional] actors playing doctors who come to care about their patients\\", while The Boston Globes Matthew Gilbert appreciated that the episode did not sugarcoat the flaws of the characters to assuage viewers' fears about \\"HMO factories\\". Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times said that though the characters might be a turn-off to some viewers, the gore and \\"derivative gall\\" of the show were positives to fans of procedural dramas; TV Guides Matt Roush stated House was an \\"uncommon cure for the common medical drama\\". Critics of The A.V. Club called House the \\"nastiest\\" black comedy from Fox since the 1996's short-lived television series Profit. Critics considered the series to be a bright spot among Fox's otherwise reality television-based broadcast schedule. The episode's format was compared to a rival television series, Medical Investigation. USA Today favorably stated House as more character- driven than Investigations \\"plot-driven procedural\\", and the San Francisco Chronicle felt that House was the better show due to the title character. Varietys Brian Lowry, meanwhile, stated that the two shows were too similar and House was mismatched among Fox's other programs. Other complaints included perceived stereotypes of young, attractive doctors. Sherwin Nuland of Slate gave the first episodes of the series a highly negative review, stating that \\"Of all the medical errata in this series (and there are some whoppers), the greatest is surely the conceit that a physician so remote, so neglectful of duty, so sadistic, so downright cruel as Gregory House would be tolerated in any hospital.\\" Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times felt that Laurie's portrayal of House humanized the character, but also revealed the show's deepest flaw: \\"a reliance on shallow cuteness for comic relief\\". Other complaints included a lack of characterization for the supporting characters in the first few episodes. The premiere attracted approximately seven million viewers in the United States, making it the 62nd-most-watched show for the week of November 15–21, 2004. The United Kingdom terrestrial premiere was broadcast on June 9, 2005, by Five and garnered a ten percent share (1.8 million viewers). Christopher Hoag, who composed the music for \\"Pilot\\" and the first season of House, was nominated in the 2005 Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Music Composition for the episode. Shore received a Humanitas Prize nomination for writing the episode, but lost out to John Wells, who wrote the episode of The West Wing entitled \\"NSF Thurmont\\".

Briefly, marketing ethics refers to the philosophical examination, from a moral standpoint, of particular marketing issues that are matters of moral judgment. Ethical marketing generally results in a more socially responsible and culturally sensitive business community. The establishment of marketing ethics has the potential to benefit society as a whole, both in the short- and long-term. Ethical marketing should be part of business ethics in the sense that marketing forms a significant part of any business model. Study of Ethical marketing should be included in applied ethics and involves examination of whether or not an honest and factual representation of a product or service has been delivered in a framework of cultural and social values. It promotes qualitative benefits to its customers, which other similar companies, products or services fail to recognise. The concern with ethical issues, such as child labor, working conditions, relationships with third world countries and environmental problems, has changed the attitude of the Western World towards a more socially responsible way of thinking. This has influenced companies and their response is to market their products in a more socially responsible way. The increasing trend of fair trade is an example of the impact of ethical marketing. In the Ethical Shoppers Price Index Survey (2009), fair trade was the most popular ethical badge products could have. It also revealed that many consumers distrusted green claims. (The idea of fair trade is that consumers pay a guaranteed commodity price to a small group of producers, the producers agree to pay fair labor prices and conserve the environment - a fair deal for everyone.) The philosophy of marketing is not lost with this newfound ethical slant, but rather hopes to win customer loyalty by reinforcing the positive values of the brand, creating a strong citizen brand. However, this new way of thinking does create new challenges for the marketer of the 21st century, in terms of invention and development of products to add long-term benefits without reducing the product's desirable qualities. Many brands have tried to use ethics to make themselves look responsible, often spinning environmental claims which has led to the term \\"greenwash\\". In research consumers have shown to have even less trust of ethical claims in ads than ordinary ads. media attention on ethics has resulted in many top brands suffering consumer boycotts. Although many brands have tried to use green issues, it has been noted that in research 2/3 of consumers responded more to ethical claims that relate to people rather than to than environment. Ethical marketing should not be confused with government regulations brought into force to improve consumer welfare, such as reducing sulfur dioxide emissions to improve the quality of the air. A government regulation is a legal remedy intended to mitigate or correct an ethical issue, such as pollution of the air that we all share. Enlightened ethical marketing is at work when the company and marketer recognize further improvements for humankind unrelated to those enforced by governments or public opinion. By way of example, the Coop Group refuses to invest money in tobacco, fur and any countries with oppressive regimes.

Biography Born in Liverpool, Evans was raised in Wales, United Kingdom, and became a fluent Welsh language speaker. He has educated at Shrewsbury and University College, Oxford, where he studied medicine. He qualified as a medical doctor in 1942 and joined the Royal Army Medical Corps. Mountaineer He had previously climbed many of the classic routes in the Alps and put this experience to good use during travels in Sikkim and the Himalaya during the war. After demobilisation in 1947, he was a surgeon in Liverpool until 1957. Evans was on Eric Shipton's 1952 British Cho Oyu expedition, a preparation for 1953. Evans was then John Hunt's deputy leader on the 1953 British Mount Everest Expedition, which made the first ascent of Everest in 1953. Evans and Tom Bourdillon were the first assault party, and made the first ascent of the South Summit. They had come within three hundred feet of the main summit of Everest on 26 May 1953, but were forced to turn back due to tiredness, lack of enough oxygen for the return and malfunctioning of the (experimental closed-circuit) oxygen apparatus. The summit of Everest was reached by their teammates Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in the second assault party three days later, on 29 May 1953. Evans was the leader of the expedition which first climbed Kangchenjunga, the world's third highest peak, in 1955. The following year he was awarded the Royal Geographical Society's Patron's Gold Medal. He was the Principal of the University College of North Wales (now called Bangor University) from 1958 to 1984. He was President of the Alpine Club from 1967 to 1970. In 1969 he was knighted in a list of honours celebrating the occasion of the investiture of the Prince of Wales, for services to mountaineering.

The magazine was published monthly from 1959 to 1961 then bi-monthly until November 1972. Charles Tepfer was the first editor and Robert Beason was the editor for rest of the magazine's run (1961 -1972). The headquarters was in Greenwich, Connecticut. Ziff-Davis success with Popular Electronics magazine showed there was a market for electronics hobbyist magazines and the launch of the Sputnik satellite in 1957 had increased the public's interest in science and technology. Electronics Illustrated (EI) was targeted for this hobbyist and do-it-yourself audience. The cover of the second issue had a rocket built in a basement workshop. To promote amateur rocketry the U.S. Army began a series titled \\"Build a Safe Model Missile.\\" Model rockets appeared on the covers and in articles for several years. The space race between the United States and the Soviet Union led many hobbyists into amateur rocketry. In the late 1960s Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) was formed to sell instrumentation to rocket hobbyist. They were unsuccessful at that venture but later created the Altair 8800 computer kit that sparked the home computer revolution. The construction projects in Electronics Illustrated were assembled and checked by the editors. The articles had numerous photos and always included a wiring diagram in addition to the schematic. The projects were not as complex as those in other magazines but they appealed to the beginner. The magazine also had introductory theory articles in every issue. Radio was another focus of the magazine with many articles on Citizens Band (CB), Amateur Radio and Short Wave Listening (SWL) Robert Hertzberg began an amateur radio column, The Ham Shack, in April 1961. Hertzberg got his license in 1919 and had been writing about amateur radio ever since. The column was taken over by Wayne Greene, the publisher of 73 magazine, as early as 1970. In the final years of magazine, Tom Kneitel wrote a column in Electronics Illustrated that was similar to Tom McCahill column in Mechanix Illustrated. Fawcett discontinued Electronics Illustrated with the November 1972 issue and some of the content was continued in Mechanix Illustrated. The circulation was 300,000 but Fawcett claimed there was a shrinking market for electronics magazines and they wanted to focus on the larger Mechanix Illustrated audience of 1.5 million readers. This followed Ziff-Davis's merger of Electronics World with Popular Electronics in January 1972.

Aired on November 13, 2006, it was the second of the four episodes to be aired during the November sweeps in the United States. The episode was written by Monica Macer and Seth Hoffman, and directed by Greg Yaitanes, who directed \\"Brother's Keeper\\". Rockmond Dunbar (who plays Benjamin Miles \\"C-Note\\" Franklin) was the only regular cast member who did not appear in this episode. The episode title refers to the coded location of the rendezvous between the protagonist Michael Scofield and a people-smuggler. The events in this episode take place on June 4 as indicated by Michael in \\"Buried\\". Plot T-Bag (Robert Knepper) escapes Susan Hollander's house in Tribune, Kansas by severing his reattached hand, narrowly escaping apprehension by the Tribune police. He then proceeds to use his GPS device to track the location of Charles Westmoreland's money and finds it in Geary's possession. Geary (Matt DeCaro) is at an expensive hotel suite when three call girls arrive. When his indecent proposal costs him seven hundred fifty dollars, Geary reaches into the bag of money and notices the GPS tracking device. Before he can react, a more than usually disheveled T-Bag arrives and tells the call girls to leave. He threatens a frightened Geary with a champagne bottle as Geary suggests splitting the money, saying \\"Come on T, we can deal\\". T-Bag appears to disagree. The second-to-next scene shows T-Bag drinking champagne and going through the backpack, where he finds cigarettes and what appears to be a receipt, while studying this he gets a cunning look. The song playing in this scene is \\"The Only Hell My Mama Ever Raised\\" by Johnny Paycheck. In the meantime, Brad Bellick (Wade Williams) is at a Tribune hospital talking to Detective Slattery (Romy Rosemont), telling her that a black male in his early twenties attacked him at the bus station. Slattery finds holes in Bellick's story; when she leaves the room, Bellick threatens Roy Geary on his voice mail. As Bellick leaves the hospital, he sees Geary dead on a gurney, admits that they were friends, and Slattery tells Bellick she needs to ask him more questions. In Maljamar, New Mexico, Michael (Wentworth Miller) buys some supplies, but steals a GPS device. The elderly shopkeeper tries to stop Michael but is overpowered by him, and Michael escapes with the GPS. This is a catalyst for Michael, who realises what he is becoming. A montage of all the wrongs committed for the sake of the escape appears strongly in his memory, prompting him to go to a confessional to confess his sins. He vaguely describes his sins to the priest, and also explains that as a child, he saw a man bleed to death and was glad for it. Michael then hitchhikes to Country Road 17 and uses his GPS to find the location of Bolshoi Booze. While waiting at the location, the Coyote (people smuggler) arrives with two associates in a blue Ford pickup. In exchange for the escape plane, Michael was to give a box of medical nitroglycerin as promised. However, when the \\"nitro\\" is tested, it is discovered to be sugar water. The real nitroglycerin Michael had prepared to bring was already confiscated by the F.B.I. in episode \\"Unearthed\\". The head Coyote (Jose Zuniga) and his two men threaten to kill Michael but Fernando Sucre (Amaury Nolasco) suddenly appears and rescues Michael, shooting the ringleader in the shoulder. They tie up Michael's would be killers. Aware of the fact that the ringleader may die from his wound without medical attention, Michael, with his confession fresh on his mind, lets the men go, and discovers the true location of the plane - \\"The seven mile marker at Route 4\\". The ringleader further says that \\"It's going to stop for five minutes. Then it's going to go to Oaxaca, Mexico.\\" In the safe house at Trinidad, Colorado, Aldo Burrows (Anthony Denison) explains to his son Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell) and his grandson L. J. Burrows (Marshall Allman) about the nature of the conspiracy. He explains how President Caroline Reynolds is serving The Company. He also says that an NSA analyst acquired a conversation between Reynolds and Terrence Steadman two weeks after Steadman's purported death. Although the analyst was apprehended, a digital copy of the conversation was sent to Sara Tancredi's father, Governor Frank Tancredi (John Heard). Aldo says of Sara (Sarah Wayne Callies), \\"She's the key to this whole thing, Lincoln.\\" Agent Kim's operative kills two of Aldo's men, and attempts to kill Lincoln as well. Lincoln rushes and stabs the operative, and Jane (Kristin Lehman) shoots the latter dead. The operative's mobile phone rings, and despite Aldo's warning, Lincoln answers the call. He threatens Agent Kim (Reggie Lee), who replies, \\"You don't even know who I am.\\" Lincoln and LJ part ways; LJ goes with Jane to safety, while Aldo and Lincoln head to Bolshoi Booze to meet Michael. Michael, Sucre, and Lincoln meet. When Michael sees Aldo, he recognizes him. Agent Paul Kellerman (Paul Adelstein) binds and gags Sara in a Gila, New Mexico motel room. Kellerman explains to Sara that he is not Lance, he is not an addict, and proceeds to interrogate her regarding the item her father took from Washington, DC. When Sara repeatedly denies knowledge of it, Kellerman tortures her by dunking her in a filled bathtub. When he still cannot get the information, Kellerman dons rubber gloves, dumps a working iron into the bathtub and dunking Sara again to add an electrocution effect to the torture routine. Agent Kim later calls Kellerman and orders him to kill Sara. After considering the matter and Sara's refusal to give in, Kellerman dunks her into the water and holds her down. Agent Alexander Mahone (William Fichtner) is still in the factory near Gila when Agent Kim arrives to open the gate. He explains to Mahone that once Burrows crosses the border, he is of no use to The Company. Mahone roughs up Kim when he appears to threaten his son, Cameron. Losing a desperate battle to discover the meaning of Bolshoi Booze, Mahone tries to call his wife Pam (Callie Thorne), but she does not pick up the phone. Upon re-examining the photograph of the tattoo, Mahone realizes that Bolshoi Booze upside down are geographical coordinates, located at . Agent Wheeler tells Mahone the exact location of the coordinates, and Mahone hangs up on him. Wheeler tells the other agents, \\"He's keeping us out of the loop.\\" Pam calls Mahone back. Mahone tells Pam that he would do things differently if he had a chance to change the way events transpired between them. Pam offers to pick him up, but Mahone tells Pam he loves her and hangs up. Production The character, Aldo Burrows, reveals in the episode that the incriminating conversation between (now President) Reynolds and her brother happened a few months after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Since the events of the show begin three years after Steadman's \\"death\\", this would place the show in the year of 2005. This was later confirmed in the episode, \\"Wash\\".

Background The chestnut filly was foaled near Lexington, Kentucky, in 1901. She was by Octagon, out of the English-bred Bella Donna (by The Derby winner Hermit). Named Beldame, she was a homebred of August Belmont Jr.'s (after whose family the Belmont Stakes as well as Belmont Park were named), and though Belmont Jr. continued to own her, he leased her as a two- and three-year-old to a business associate named Newton Bennington. Although she won two races before going to Bennington, it was while racing for him that Beldame began her great career, earning her place as number 98 in the Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century. (Aside from Beldame, Belmont bred 129 stakes winners, including Man o' War. The colt was originally named My Man O' War by his wife since August Jr. had enlisted in World War I at the age of 65. Because of the war, he sold his best horse to Samuel D. Riddle for $5,000.) Career and retirement As a two-year-old, Beldame won the Great Filly Stakes at Sheepshead Bay Race Track and the Vernal Stakes (wiring the field). When Beldame was three, she won twelve of her fourteen starts, earning the championship of her division. Her only losses came against older males. That year, she took the Alabama Stakes, the Gazelle Handicap (by ten lengths on a sloppy track), the Carter Handicap (against males by over two lengths under a stout hold), the Ladies Stakes, the Saratoga Cup (beating the year-older Belmont Stakes winner and Champion Three-Year-Colt, Africander), the First Special, the Second Special, the Dolphin Sakes, the Mermaid Stakes (winning by seven lengths and drawing away from the field even as she was being eased up), and the September Stakes. In the Ladies Stakes, Beldame got loose under her substitute rider before the race and galloped all over the track looking for an opening to run back to the barn. She found it before her jockey, Gene Hildebrand, got her under control. She returned to the track minutes later, wired the race, and won easily. Due to her success, track officials weighted Beldame so heavily she won only twice at the age of four. That year, she won the Standard Handicap, and then, carrying more weight than the males, she won the Suburban Handicap, beating Broomstick by five lengths. Beldame retired with 17 wins, 6 places, and 4 shows from 31 starts. Her earnings amounted to $102,570. Following Firenze and Miss Woodford, she was the third filly to win more than $100,000. Her usual rider was Hall of Famer Frank O'Neill. Her first trainer, when she was campaigned by Belmont, was Hall of Famer John Hyland. While she was leased to Bennington, Hall of Famer Fred Burlew trained her. After Beldame's retirement, Belmont took her to the re-creation of his father's Nursery Stud, the original farm being dispersed after August Belmont's death. Honors In a poll among members of the American Trainers Association conducted in 1955 by Delaware Park Racetrack, Beldame was voted the seventh greatest filly in American racing history. Gallorette was voted first. Beldame, who died in 1924, was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1956.

Glennon (1857–1940). Glennon was launched on 14 July 1945 by the Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine; sponsored by Miss Frances Reading Glennon, granddaughter; and commissioned on 4 October 1945, Commander George W. Pressey in command. Service history =1945-1951= After shakedown off Cuba, Glennon sailed from Boston, Massachusetts on 12 February 1946 for Europe and visited many of the nations washed by the North Sea before returning to New York in August of the same year. Undergoing upkeep at Boston and overhaul at Newport, Rhode Island, Glennon conducted refresher training out of Guantanamo Bay during April and May 1947. For the next 12 months she engaged in a rigorous schedule of tactics along the New England coast and down the eastern seaboard to ports of Florida. In February and March 1948 she took part in combat fleet exercises and maneuvers in waters ranging from Cuba to Trinidad and the Panama Canal. Sailing from Norfolk, Virginia in June 1948, Glennon served with the Midshipman Practice Squadron and made calls at Portugal, Italy, and French Morocco. She joined the 6th Fleet in August 1948 for Mediterranean duty, returning stateside in January 1949 for overhaul at Boston. In the winter of 1949–50 she was part of \\"Operation Frostbite\\", a cold weather exercise near the Davis Strait, subsequently to sail from Newport on 4 January 1950 for another \\"Med\\" cruise. Upon return to the United States, she made a series of reserve training cruises along the eastern, seaboard and engaged in type training along the New England coast and into the Caribbean Sea. Underway from Newport on 8 January 1951, she embarked on another \\"Med\\" cruise, returning to Boston in May for overhaul followed by refresher training out of Cuba. =1952-1967= Glennon spent January and February 1952 with a carrier task force conducting cold weather training in waters ranging northward to the Davis Straits. From April to October she was flagship of Destroyer Squadron 8 (DesRon 8), and stood out in June for the Mediterranean, returning to Annapolis, Maryland in September 1952. In July and August 1952 'Glennon' was part of a Task Group with the flagship New Jersey which conducted Midshipman training on a six-week cruise. The Task Group shipped out of Newport News, VA with ports of call at Cherbourg, Lisbon, and Guantanamo. For more than a decade the destroyer continued her already established peacetime operation pattern. Highlights of this exacting duty included participation as a recovery station ship in the 1961 and 1962 Project Mercury flights, and in the search for the lost nuclear powered submarine . In August 1961 Glennon was called away suddenly to join the task force for the Project Mercury space shot carrying Major Gus Grissom. In early 1962 she was again chosen to man an Atlantic recovery station for the historic three-orbit flight of Major John Glenn. An extensive overhaul at Boston terminated on 24 July 1963, and through the remainder of that year Glennon trained in the Caribbean, acted as school ship for the Anti-submarine Warfare School at Key West, Florida, and put in at Boston in November for refitting. The years 1964 and 1965 found Glennon continuing her ASW work. In September 1964 she was chosen to carry guests to the America's Cup Races. Later in May 1965 she conducted exercises called \\"Mule 65\\" in which United States Army cadets from West Point were given shipboard indoctrination. Through 1967 Glennon continued to operate with the United States Atlantic Fleet. =1967-1976= Glennon was called to serve with TF77 as a Naval Gunfire Support Unit off Viet Nam in 1972. She made a 72-hour notice emergency deployment from Charleston South Carolina through the Panama Canal. She supported many operations and answered many calls for fire in South Viet Nam and around the DMZ. She also supported operations off North Viet Nam, and was involved in several fire fights with shore batteries. Her Officers and crew wear the Combat Action Ribbon, multiple awards. Glennon was decommissioned and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 October 1976. She was sunk as a target off Puerto Rico on 26 February 1981.

He is best known for his reputation and later conviction as a confessed serial killer of children. A member of the House of Montmorency-Laval, Gilles de Rais grew up under the tutelage of his maternal grandfather and increased his fortune by marriage. He earned the favour of the Duke of Brittany and was admitted to the French court. From 1427 to 1435, Rais served as a commander in the French army, and fought alongside Joan of Arc against the English and their Burgundian allies during the Hundred Years' War, for which he was appointed Marshal of France. In 1434 or 1435 he retired from military life, depleted his wealth by staging an extravagant theatrical spectacle of his own composition, and was accused of dabbling in the occult. After 1432, Rais was accused of engaging in a series of child murders, with victims possibly numbering in the hundreds. The killings came to an end in 1440, when a violent dispute with a clergyman led to an ecclesiastical investigation that brought the crimes to light, and attributed them to Rais. At his trial the parents of missing children in the surrounding area and Rais's own confederates in crime testified against him. He was condemned to death and hanged at Nantes on 26 October 1440. Rais is believed to be the inspiration for the French folktale \\"Bluebeard\\" (\\"Barbe bleue\\"), which is earliest recorded in 1697.  Early life  Gilles de Rais was born on an unknown date, perhaps in late 1405 to Guy II de Montmorency- Laval and Marie de Craon in the family castle at Champtocé-sur-Loire. Ambroise Ledru, \\"Gilles de Rais dit Barbe-Bleue, maréchal de France. Sa jeunesse, 1404–1424\\", L'union historique et littéraire du Maine, vol. I, 1893, pp. 270–284; Matei Cazacu, Gilles de Rais, 2005, p.11. He was an intelligent child, speaking fluent Latin, illuminating manuscripts, and dividing his education between military discipline and moral and intellectual development. Following the deaths of his father and mother in 1415, Gilles and his younger brother René de La Suze were placed under the tutelage of Jean de Craon, their maternal grandfather. Craon was a schemer who attempted to arrange the marriage of 12-year-old Gilles to four-year-old Jeanne Paynel, one of the richest heiresses in Normandy; when the plan failed, he attempted unsuccessfully to unite the boy with Béatrice de Rohan, the niece to the Duke of Brittany. On 30 November 1420, Craon substantially increased his grandson's fortune by marrying him to Catherine de Thouars of Brittany, heiress of La Vendée and Poitou. Their only child, Marie, was born in 1429.  Military career  Coat of arms of Gilles de Rais In the decades following the Breton War of Succession (1341–64), the defeated faction led by Olivier de Blois, Count of Penthièvre, continued to plot against the Dukes of the House of Montfort. The Blois faction, which refused to relinquish its claim to rule over the Duchy of Brittany, had taken Duke John VI prisoner in violation of the Treaty of Guérande (1365). The 16-year-old Gilles took the side of the House of Montfort. He was able to secure the Duke's release and was rewarded with generous land grants that were converted to monetary gifts. In 1425, Rais was introduced to the court of Charles VII at Saumur and learned courtly manners by studying the Dauphin. At the battle for the Château du Lude he took prisoner the English captain Blackburn.Cazacu, pg. 79 From 1427 to 1435, Rais served as a commander in the Royal Army, distinguishing himself for bravery on the battlefield during the renewal of the Hundred Years War. In 1429, he fought alongside Joan of Arc in some of the campaigns waged against the English and their Burgundian allies. He was present with Joan when the English Siege of Orléans was lifted. On 17 July 1429, Rais was one of four lords chosen for the honour of bringing the Holy Ampulla from the Abbey of Saint- Remy to Notre-Dame de Reims for the consecration of Charles VII as King of France. On the same day, he was officially created a Marshal of France. Following the Siege of Orléans, Rais was granted the right to add a border of the royal arms, the fleur-de-lys on an azure ground, to his own. The letters patent authorizing the display cited his \\"high and commendable services\\", the \\"great perils and dangers\\" he had confronted, and \\"many other brave feats\\". In May 1431, Joan of Arc was burned at the stake in Rouen; Rais was not present. His grandfather died on 15 November 1432, and, in a public gesture to mark his displeasure with Rais' reckless spending of a carefully amassed fortune, left his sword and his breastplate to Rais' younger brother René de La Suze.  Private life  In either 1434 or 1435, Rais gradually withdrew from military and public life to pursue his own interests: the construction of a splendid Chapel of the Holy Innocents (where he officiated in robes of his own design), and the production of a theatrical spectacle, Le Mistère du Siège d'Orléans. The play consisted of more than 20,000 lines of verse, requiring 140 speaking parts and 500 extras. Rais was almost bankrupt at the time of the production and began selling property as early as 1432 to support his extravagant lifestyle. By March 1433, he had sold all his estates in Poitou (except his wife's) and all his property in Maine. Only two castles in Anjou, Champtocé- sur-Loire and Ingrandes, remained in his possession. Half the total sales and mortgages was spent on the production of his play. It was first performed in Orléans on 8 May 1435. Six hundred costumes were constructed, worn once, discarded, and constructed afresh for subsequent performances. Unlimited supplies of food and drink were made available to spectators at Rais' expense. In June 1435, family members gathered to put a curb on Rais. They appealed to Pope Eugene IV to disavow the Chapel of the Holy Innocents (he refused) and carried their concerns to the king. On 2 July 1435, a royal edict was proclaimed in Orléans, Tours, Angers, Pouzauges and Champtocé-sur-Loire denouncing Rais as a spendthrift and forbidding him to sell any more property. No subject of Charles VII was allowed to enter into any contract with him, and those in command of his castles were forbidden to dispose of them. Rais' credit fell immediately and his creditors pressed upon him. He borrowed heavily, using his objets d'art, manuscripts, books and clothing as security. When he left Orléans in late August or early September 1435, the town was littered with precious objects he was forced to leave behind. The edict did not apply to Brittany, and the family was unable to persuade the Duchy of Brittany to enforce it. = Occult involvement = In 1438, according to testimony at his trial by the priest Eustache Blanchet and the cleric François Prelati, Rais sent out Blanchet to seek individuals who knew alchemy and demon summoning. Blanchet contacted Prelati in Florence and persuaded him to take service with his Master. Having reviewed the magical books of Prelati and a traveling Breton, Rais chose to initiate experiments, the first in the lower hall of his castle at Tiffauges, attempting to summon a demon named Barron. Rais provided a contract with the demon for riches that Prelati was to give to the demon later. As no demon manifested after three tries, the Marshal grew frustrated with the lack of results. Prelati said Barron was angry and required the offering of parts of a child. Rais provided these remnants in a glass vessel at a future evocation, but to no avail, and the occult experiments left him bitter and his wealth severely depleted.  Child murders  In his confession, Rais said he committed his first assaults on children between spring 1432 and spring 1433. The first murders occurred at Champtocé- sur-Loire, but no account of them survived. Shortly after, Rais moved to Machecoul, where, according to his confession, he killed, or ordered to be killed, a large but uncertain number of children after he sodomized them. The first documented case of child-snatching and murder concerns a boy of 12 called Jeudon (first name unknown), an apprentice to the furrier Guillaume Hilairet. Rais' cousins Gilles de Sillé and Roger de Briqueville asked the furrier to lend them the boy to take a message to Machecoul, and, when Jeudon did not return, the two noblemen told the inquiring furrier that they were ignorant of the boy's whereabouts and suggested he had been carried off by thieves at Tiffauges to be made into a page. At Rais' trial, the events were attested to by Hilairet and his wife, the boy's father Jean Jeudon, and five others from Machecoul. In his 1971 biography of Rais, Jean Benedetti tells how the children who fell into Rais' hands were put to death: Rais' bodyservant Étienne Corrillaut, known as Poitou, was an accomplice in many of the crimes and testified that his master stripped the child naked and hung him with ropes from a hook to prevent him from crying out, then masturbated upon the child's belly or thighs. If the victim was a boy he would touch his genitals (particularly testicles) and buttocks. Taking the victim down, Rais comforted the child and assured him he only wanted to play with him. Rais then either killed the child himself or had the child killed by his cousin Gilles de Sillé, Poitou or another bodyservant called Henriet. The victims were killed by decapitation, cutting of their throats, dismemberment, or breaking of their necks with a stick. A short, thick, double-edged sword called a braquemard was kept at hand for the murders. Poitou further testified that Rais sometimes abused the victims (whether boys or girls) before wounding them and at other times after the victim had been slashed in the throat or decapitated. According to Poitou, Rais disdained the victims' sexual organs, and took \\"infinitely more pleasure in debauching himself in this manner ... than in using their natural orifice, in the normal manner.\\" In his own confession, Gilles testified that “when the said children were dead, he kissed them and those who had the most handsome limbs and heads he held up to admire them, and had their bodies cruelly cut open and took delight at the sight of their inner organs; and very often when the children were dying he sat on their stomachs and took pleasure in seeing them die and laughed”. Poitou testified that he and Henriet burned the bodies in the fireplace in Rais' room. The clothes of the victim were placed into the fire piece by piece so they burned slowly and the smell was minimized. The ashes were then thrown into the cesspit, the moat, or other hiding places. The last recorded murder was of the son of Éonnet de Villeblanche and his wife Macée. Poitou paid 20 sous to have a page's doublet made for the victim, who was then assaulted, murdered and incinerated in August 1440. = Trial and execution = Trial of Gilles de Rais On 15 May 1440, Rais kidnapped a cleric during a dispute at the Church of Saint-Étienne-de-Mer-Morte. The act prompted an investigation by the Bishop of Nantes, during which evidence of Rais' crimes was uncovered. On 29 July, the Bishop released his findings, and he subsequently obtained the prosecutorial cooperation of Rais' former protector, John VI, Duke of Brittany. Rais and his bodyservants Poitou and Henriet were arrested on 15 September 1440, following a secular investigation that corroborated the Bishop's. Rais' prosecution was likewise conducted by both secular and ecclesiastical courts, on charges that included murder, sodomy and heresy. The extensive witness testimony convinced the judges that there were adequate grounds to establish the guilt of the accused. After Rais admitted to the charges on 21 October, the court canceled a plan to torture him into confessing. Peasants of neighboring villages had earlier begun to make accusations that their children had entered Rais' castle begging for food and were never seen again. The transcript, which included testimony by the parents of many of these children as well as graphic descriptions of the murders provided by Rais' accomplices, was said to be so lurid that the judges ordered the worst parts to be struck from the record. The number of Rais' victims is not known, as most of the bodies were burned or buried. The number of murders is generally placed between 100 and 200; a few have conjectured that there were more than 600. The victims ranged in age from 6 to 18 and were predominantly boys. Execution of Gilles de Rais On 23 October 1440, the secular court heard the confessions of Poitou and Henriet and condemned them both to death, followed by Rais' death sentence on 25 October. Rais was allowed to make confession, and his request to be buried in the church of the monastery of Notre-Dame des Carmes in Nantes was granted. Execution by hanging and burning was set for Wednesday 26 October. At nine o‘clock, Rais and his two accomplices processed to the place of execution on the Ile de Biesse. Rais is said to have addressed the crowd with contrite piety and exhorted Henriet and Poitou to die bravely and think only of salvation. His request to be the first to die had been granted the day before. At eleven o'clock, the brush at the platform was set afire and Rais was hanged. His body was cut down before being consumed by the flames and claimed by \\"four ladies of high rank\\" for burial.Several years after Gilles' death, his daughter Marie had a stone memorial erected at the site of his execution. Over the years, the structure came to be regarded as a holy altar under the protection of Saint Anne. Generations of pregnant women flocked there to pray for an abundance of breast milk. The memorial was destroyed by rioting Jacobins during the French Revolution in the late 18th century. Henriet and Poitou were executed in similar fashion but their bodies were reduced to ashes in the flames and then scattered. After such controversy, the family changed the spelling variation to De Rée. This was later changed over centuries from De Rée to Durée after a further falling-out with the Catholic Church leading to the family becoming Huguenots and leaving France. = Question of guilt = Although Gilles de Rais was convicted of murdering many children by his confessions and the detailed eyewitness accounts of his own confederates and victims' parents, doubts have persisted about the verdict. Counterarguments are based on the theory that Rais was himself a victim of an ecclesiastic plot or act of revenge by the Catholic Church or French State. Doubts about Rais' guilt have long persisted because the Duke of Brittany, who was given the authority to prosecute, received all the titles to Rais' former lands after his conviction. The Duke then divided the land among his own nobles. Writers such as secret societies specialist Jean-Pierre Bayard, in his book Plaidoyer pour Gilles de Rais, contend he was a victim of the Inquisition. In the early 20th century, anthropologist Margaret Murray and occultist Aleister Crowley questioned the involvement of the ecclesiastic and secular authorities in the case. Crowley described Rais as \\"in almost every respect...the male equivalent of Joan of Arc\\", whose main crime was \\"the pursuit of knowledge\\". Murray, who propagated the witch-cult hypothesis, speculated in her book The Witch-Cult in Western Europe that Rais was really a witch and an adherent of a fertility cult centred on the pagan goddess Diana. Most historians reject Murray's theory.Hutton, Ronald. The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles: Their Nature and Legacy. Oxford: Blackwell Publishers, 1991.Hutton, Ronald.

Norman Cohn argues that it is inconsistent with what is known of Rais' crimes and trial.Cohn, Norman. Europe's Inner Demons. London: Pimlico, 1973.Thomas, Keith. Religion and the Decline of Magic, 1971 and 1997, pp. 514–517. Historians do not regard Rais as a martyr to a pre- Christian religion; other scholars tend to view him as a lapsed Catholic who descended into crime and depravity, and whose real crimes caused the land forfeitures.Barett, W.P.

Vorderasiatisches Museum Berlin Bronze griffin head from upright The griffin, griffon, or gryphon (Ancient Greek: , grū́ps; Classical Latin: grȳps or grȳpus; Late and Medieval Latin: gryphes, grypho etc.; Old French: griffon) is a legendary creature with the body, tail, and back legs of a lion; the head and wings of an eagle; and sometimes an eagle's talons as its front feet. Because the lion was traditionally considered the king of the beasts, and the eagle the king of the birds, by the Middle Ages, the griffin was thought to be an especially powerful and majestic creature. Since classical antiquity, griffins were known for guarding treasures and priceless possessions. In Greek and Roman texts, griffins and Arimaspians were associated with gold deposits of Central Asia. Indeed, as Pliny the Elder wrote, \\"griffins were said to lay eggs in burrows on the ground and these nests contained gold nuggets.\\" In medieval heraldry, the griffin became a Christian symbol of divine power and a guardian of the divine. Etymology The Pisa Griffin, in the Pisa Cathedral Museum, 11th century The derivation of this word remains uncertain. It could be related to the Greek word (grypos), meaning 'curved', or 'hooked'. It could also have been an Anatolian loan word: compare Akkadian karūbu (winged creature), and the phonetically similar cherub. A related Hebrew word is (kerúv).William H. C. Propp, Exodus 19–40, volume 2A of The Anchor Bible, New York: Doubleday, 2006, , page 386; citing Julius Wellhausen, Prolegomena to the History of Israel, Edinburgh: Black, 1885, page 304. Also see Robert S. P. Beekes, Etymological Dictionary of Greek, volume 1, Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2010 , page 289, entry for , \\"From the archaeological perspective, origin in Asia Minor (and the Near East: Elam) is very probable.\\" Form Most statuary representations of griffins depict them with bird-like talons, although in some older illustrations griffins have a lion's forelimbs; they generally have a lion's hindquarters. Its eagle's head is conventionally given prominent ears; these are sometimes described as the lion's ears, but are often elongated (more like a horse's), and are sometimes feathered. Infrequently, a griffin is portrayed without wings, or a wingless eagle-headed lion is identified as a griffin. In 15th-century and later heraldry, such a beast may be called an alke or a keythong. When depicted on coats of arms, the griffin is called the Opinicus, which may be derived from the Greek name Ophinicus, referring to the serpent astronomical constellation. In these depictions, it has the body of a lion with either two or four legs, the head of an eagle or dragon, the wings of an eagle, and a camel's tail. History Abdera was known as \\"the Griffon\\" because of the mythical animal depicted on it Representations of griffin-like hybrids with four legs and a beaked head appeared in Ancient Iranian and Ancient Egyptian art dating back to before 3000 BC.Illustrated Dictionary of Egyptian Mythology.

In Iranian mythology, the griffin is called Shirdal, which means \\"Lion-Eagle\\". The Shirdal has appeared in ancient art of Iran since the late 2nd millennium BC. Shirdals appeared on cylinder seals from Susa as early as 3000 BC.Image of Persian griffin from The Granger Collection. www.granger.com. Retrieved on 26 May 2014. Shirdals also are common motifs in the art of Luristan, the North and North West region of Iran in the Iron Age, and Achaemenid art. Griffin-type creatures combining raptor heads and mammalian bodies were depicted in the Levant, Syria, and Anatolia in the Middle Bronze Age, dated at about 1950-1550 BC. Early depictions of griffin- types in Ancient Greek art are found in the 15th century BC frescoes in the Throne Room of the Bronze Age Palace of Knossos, as restored by Sir Arthur Evans. Bird-mammal composites were a decorative theme in Archaic and Classical Greek art, but became quite popular in the 6th and 5th centuries BC, when the Greeks first began to record accounts of the \\"gryps\\" creature from travelers to Asia, such as Aristeas of Proconnesus. In Central Asia, the griffin image was included in Scythian \\"animal style\\" artifacts of the 6th–4th centuries BC, but no writings explain their meaning. Bronze figure of a griffin, Roman period ( AD 50 – 270) Griffin segreant wearing the mural crown of Perugia, 13th century A soldier fighting a griffin, 'Alphonso' Psalter, 1284 upright Medieval tapestry, Basel, c. 1450 Griffin images appeared in art of the Achaemenid Persian Empire. Russian jewelry historian Elena Neva maintained that the Achaemenids considered the griffin \\"a protector from evil, witchcraft and secret slander\\". (citing ) But no writings exist from Achaemenid Persia to support her claim. Robin Lane Fox, in Alexander the Great, 1973:31 and notes p. 506, remarks that a 'lion-griffin' attacks a stag in a pebble mosaic of the fourth century BCDartmouth College expedition at Pella, perhaps serving as an emblem of the kingdom of Macedon or a personal one of Alexander's successor Antipater. The Pisa Griffin is a large bronze sculpture that has been in Pisa in Italy since the Middle Ages, though it is of Islamic origin. It is the largest bronze medieval Islamic sculpture known, at over three feet tall (42.5 inches, or 1.08 m.), and was probably created in the 11th century AD in Al- Andaluz (Islamic Spain).; Hoffman, 318 From about 1100 it was placed on a column on the roof of Pisa Cathedral until replaced by a replica in 1832; the original is now in the Museo dell' Opera del Duomo (Cathedral Museum), Pisa. Ancient parallels Several ancient mythological creatures are similar to the griffin. These include the Lamassu, an Assyrian protective deity, often depicted with a bull or lion's body, eagle's wings, and human's head. Sumerian and Akkadian mythology feature the demon Anzu, half man and half bird, associated with the chief sky god Enlil. This was a divine storm-bird linked with the southern wind and the thunder clouds. Jewish mythology speaks of the Ziz, which resembles Anzu, as well as the ancient Greek Phoenix. The Bible mentions the Ziz in Psalms 50:11. This is also similar to a cherub. The cherub, or sphinx, was very popular in Phoenician iconography. In ancient Crete, griffins became very popular, and were portrayed in various media. A similar creature is the Minoan Genius. In the Hindu religion, Garuda is a large bird-like creature which serves as a mount (vahana) of the Lord Vishnu. It is also the name for the constellation Aquila. Medieval lore In medieval legend, griffins not only mated for life, but if either partner died, then the other would continue the rest of its life alone, never to search for a new mate. The griffin was thus made an emblem of the Church's opposition to remarriage. Being a union of an aerial bird and a terrestrial beast, it was seen in Christendom to be a symbol of Jesus, who was both human and divine. As such it can be found sculpted on some churches. According to Stephen Friar's New Dictionary of Heraldry, a griffin's claw was believed to have medicinal properties and one of its feathers could restore sight to the blind. Goblets fashioned from griffin claws (actually antelope horns) and griffin eggs (actually ostrich eggs) were highly prized in medieval European courts. When Genoa emerged as a major seafaring power in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, griffins commenced to be depicted as part of the republic's coat of arms, rearing at the sides of the shield bearing the Cross of St. George. By the 12th century, the appearance of the griffin was substantially fixed: \\"All its bodily members are like a lion's, but its wings and mask are like an eagle's.\\" It is not yet clear if its forelimbs are those of an eagle or of a lion. Although the description implies the latter, the accompanying illustration is ambiguous. It was left to the heralds to clarify that. A hippogriff is a legendary creature, supposedly the offspring of a griffin and a mare. In heraldry In heraldry, the griffin's amalgamation of lion and eagle gains in courage and boldness, and it is always drawn to powerful fierce monsters. It is used to denote strength and military courage and leadership. Griffins are portrayed with the rear body of a lion, an eagle's head with erect ears, a feathered breast, and the forelegs of an eagle, including claws. These features indicate a combination of intelligence and strength.Stefan Oliver, Introduction to Heraldry. David & Charles, 2002. P. 44. Griffins may be shown in a variety of poses, but in British heraldry are never shown with their wings closed. Heraldic griffins use the same attitude terminology as the lion, with the exception that where a lion would be described as rampant a griffin is instead described as segreant.Arthur Fox-Davies, A Complete Guide to Heraldry, T.C. and E.C. Jack, London, 1909, p 222-224, https://archive.org/details/completeguidetoh00foxduoft. In British heraldry, a male griffin is shown without wings, its body covered in tufts of formidable spikes, with a short tusk emerging from the forehead, as for a unicorn.Male griffin depicted in Debrett's Peerage, 1968, p. 222, sinister supporter of Earl of Carrick (Ireland) This distinction is not found outside of British heraldry; even within it, male griffins are much rarer than winged ones, which are not give a specific name. It is possible that the male griffin originated as a derivation of the heraldic panther. The sea-griffin, also termed the gryphon-marine, is a heraldic variant of the griffin possessing the head and legs of the more common variant and the hindquarters of a fish or a mermaid. Sea-griffins are present on the arms of a number of German noble families, including the Mestich family of Silesia and the Barony of Puttkamer. The opincus is another heraldic variant, which is depicted with all four legs being those of a lion. Occasionally, its tail may be that of a camel or its wings may be absent. The opincus is rarely used in heraldry, but appears in the arms of the Worshipful Company of Barbers.Arthur Fox-Davies, A Complete Guide to Heraldry, T.C. and E.C.

In literature : For fictional characters named Griffin, see Griffin (surname) Flavius Philostratus mentioned them in The Life of Apollonius of Tyana: Griffins are used widely in Persian poetry; Rumi is one such poet who writes in reference to griffins.The Essential Rumi, translated from Persian by Coleman Barks, p 257 In Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy, after Dante and Virgil's journey through Hell and Purgatory has concluded, Dante meets a chariot dragged by a griffin in Earthly Paradise. Immediately afterwards, Dante is reunited with Beatrice. Dante and Beatrice then start their journey through Paradise. Sir John Mandeville wrote about them in his 14th century book of travels: Griffin misericord, Ripon Cathedral, alleged inspiration for the Gryphon in Lewis Carroll’s Alice's Adventures in Wonderland John Milton, in Paradise Lost II, refers to the legend of the griffin in describing Satan: Griffins appear in the fairy tales \\"Jack the Giant Killer\\", \\"The Griffin\\" and \\"The Singing, Springing Lark\\".

In the Harry Potter series, the character Albus Dumbledore has a griffin-shaped knocker. Also, the character Godric Gryffindor's surname is a variation on the French griffon d'or (\\"golden griffon\\"). Pomponius Mela: \\"In Europe, constantly falling snow makes those places contiguous with the Riphean Mountains so impassable that, in addition, they prevent those who deliberately travel here from seeing anything. After that comes a region of very rich soil but quite uninhabitable because griffins, a savage and tenacious breed of wild beasts, love- to an amazing degree- the gold that is mined from deep within the earth there, and because they guard it with an amazing hostility to those who set foot there.\\" (Romer, 1998.) Isidore of Seville – \\"The Gryphes are so called because they are winged quadrupeds. This kind of wild beast is found in the Hyperborean Mountains. In every part of their body they are lions, and in wings and heads are like eagles, and they are fierce enemies of horses. Moreover they tear men to pieces.\\" (Brehaut, 1912) \\"Griffin\\".eaudrey.com., n.p., 14 March 2013 Modern uses The griffin is the symbol of the Philadelphia Museum of Art; bronze castings of them perch on each corner of the museum's roof, protecting its collection.Philadelphia Museum of Art – Giving : Giving to the Museum : Specialty License Plates.

Information security firm Halock uses a griffin to represent protecting data and systems. Use for real animals Some large species of Old World vultures are called griffines, including the griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus). The scientific name for the Andean condor is Vultur gryphus, Latin for \\"griffin-vulture\\". The Catholic Douay-Rheims version of the Bible uses griffon for a creature referred to as vulture or ossifrage in other English translations (Leviticus 11:13). Possible influence by dinosaurs Early historic references to the gryphon describe the area of the Dzungarian Gate, a region where Protoceratops and Psittacosaurus skeletons are very common. Adrienne Mayor, a classical folklorist and historian of science, has speculated that the way the Greeks imagined griffins from the seventh century BC onwards may have been influenced in part by the fossilized remains of beaked dinosaurs such as Protoceratops observed on the way to gold deposits by nomadic prospectors of ancient Scythia (Central Asia),; . This speculation is based on Greek and Latin literary sources and related artworks in a specific time frame, beginning with the first written descriptions of griffins as real animals of Asia in a lost work by Aristeas (a Greek who traveled to the Altai region between Mongolia and NW China in the 7th century BC) referenced by Aeschylus and Herodotus (ca. 450 BC) and ending with Aelian (3rd century AD), the last ancient author to report any \\"new\\" details about the griffin. Mayor argues that Protoceratops fossils, seen by ancient observers, may have been interpreted as evidence of a half-bird-half-mammal creature.BBC Four television program Dinosaurs, Myths and Monsters, 8.00–0.00 pm Sat 10 December 2011 and 9.55–10.55 pm Tue 13 December 2011 She argues that over-repeated retelling and drawing or recopying its bony neck frill (which is rather fragile and may have been frequently broken or entirely weathered away) may become large mammal-type external ears, and its beak may be treated as evidence of a part-bird nature and lead to bird-type wings being added. Paleontologist Mark P. Witton has contested this hypothesis, arguing that it ignores the existence of depictions of griffins throughout the Near East dating to long before the time when Mayor posits the Greeks became aware of Protoceratops fossils in Scythia. Witton further argues that the anatomies of griffins in Greek art are clearly based on those of living creatures, especially lions and eagles, and that there are no features of griffins in Greek art that can only be explained by the hypothesis that the griffins were based on fossils. He notes that Greek accounts of griffins describe them as living creatures, not ancient skeletons, and that some of the details of these accounts suggest griffins are purely imaginary, not inspired by fossils.Mark Witton, Why Protoceratops Almost Certainly Wasn't The Inspiration For Griffin Legend See also * Anzû (older reading: Zû), Mesopotamian monster * Chimera, Greek mythological hybrid monster * Duck billed platypus, an egg- producing mammal with a beak * Hippogriff, legendary horse-eagle hybrid * Hybrid creatures in mythology * Lamassu, Assyrian deity, bull/lion-eagle-human hybrid * List of hybrid creatures in mythology * Nue, Japanese legendary creature * Pegasus, winged stallion in Greek mythology * Pixiu or Pi Yao, Chinese mythical creature * Sharabha, Hindu mythology: lion-bird hybrid * Simurgh, Iranian mythical flying creature * Snow Lion, Tibetan mythological celestial animal * Sphinx, mythical creature with lion's body and human head * Yali, Hindu mythological lion-elephant-horse hybrid * Ziz, giant griffin-like bird in Jewish mythology Notes and references * Further reading * Wild, F., Gryps-Greif-Gryphon (Griffon).

He is best known for his comedy records with Spike Jones and his own Natural Seven sides for Capitol. Personal life Ingle was born in Toledo, Ohio on 7 November 1906. He was taught basic violin from age five by Fritz Kreisler, a family friend. However at 13, he took up the saxophone, and that instrument later became his main instrument. Ingle received a music scholarship and studied at the Toledo American College of Music, playing classical music on a concert level. Ingle was also influenced by the country fiddlers he had heard; he was able to play their songs in their style as well as the classics in a traditional pose. At 15 he was playing professionally with Al Amato, and by his late teens, Ingle was touring steadily with the Jean Goldkette Orchestra, along with future jazz legends Bix Beiderbecke and Frankie Trumbauer. A graduate of Toledo's Scott High School, at one time he intended to become a teacher. Ingle left the College of Music in 1926 to become a full-time musician when he married Edwina Alice Smith. He joined Ted Weems' Orchestra in 1931, after briefly being a bandleader himself, and working under Maurice Sherman. His work with Weems was such a success that they worked together into the 1940s. Singer Perry Como later called Ingle 'one of the most talented men I've ever met.' A pilot since 1924, Ingle wrote the Army Air Forces \\"I've Got Wings\\" manual as part of his wartime work at the Civil Aeronautics Administration. A talented leather carver whose saddles were in demand by celebrities, he also taught the skill in Veterans' hospitals during this time. One of Ingle's carved saddles was on exhibit at the Golden Gate International Exposition World's fair in San Francisco in 1939: a saddle carved with images illustrating the history of the state of California. Ingle's son, Don, followed his father into the music business in 1949. The City Slickers After he failed an eye test for the Air Force, he returned to music with Spike Jones & His City Slickers, where his comedic talents and flair for vocal effects found a welcoming home. Jones started featuring him as a frontman immediately, and Ingle's stage presence helped transform the City Slickers' stage act into something more visual than before. With Ingle's input, the band gradually became a complete stage package that would eventually peak (after his departure in 1946) in the late 1940s and early 1950s with the successful Musical Depreciation Revue. \\"There was nobody in the band as funny as Red,\\" said Zep Meissner, the band's clarinetist; \\"guys like him were funny in themselves, they didn't need material.\\" An example of his routine appears in the film Bring on the Girls, where he takes off the vaudeville song \\"Chloe.\\" He would run on in a frightwig, combat boots and a nightgown, while waving a lantern, climaxing the song with the cry \\"I gotta go!\\" as he dived into an outhouse. A record of this song went gold for the band, spending four weeks in the top ten. He was also the featured vocalist on other City Slickers hits, such as \\"You Always Hurt the One You Love\\", \\"Liebestraum\\" and \\"Glow Worm\\" – this last being featured in the film Breakfast in Hollywood, one of many films featuring the band. The Natural Seven Jo Stafford as Cinderella G. Stump and Ingle performing their 1947 hit, \\"Tim- Tayshun\\", on Startime in 1960. Ingle left Jones and the City Slickers in November 1946 after a salary dispute. He drifted through Radio and Hollywood, even working in light opera, until he made \\"Tim-Tayshun\\", a spoof recording of the then-popular Perry Como hit \\"Temptation\\", with Jo Stafford (under the name \\"Cinderella G. Stump\\") for Capitol Records in 1947. As the single went on to sell three million copies, Ingle formed a new band – Red Ingle and His Natural Seven; the group included several former City Slickers, among them Country Washburn, who had arranged \\"Tim-Tayshun\\". The band had several more hits, including \\"Cigareetes, Whuskey, and Wild, Wild Women\\", \\"Them Durn Fool Things,\\" and \\"'A', You're a Dopey Gal.\\" \\"Cigareetes\\" became a hit because it was banned from radio airplay by all major networks. After \\"Tim-Tayshun's\\" success, Ingle had a follow-up in mind: a take-off on the classical works of Paganini, but doing this required a violinist who was trained in classical music. Knowing that any direct requests for a classical performer would be refused, Ingle dreamed up his own \\"classical\\" ensemble: \\"Ernest Ingle's Miniature Symphony\\". A concert violinist responded and was quickly signed to a recording contract for the intended record. When the musician was shown the arrangement he was to play, he protested and attempted to leave without performing. Ingle and his band quickly reminded the violinist of the legality of the contract he had just signed. A deal was struck to get \\"Pagan Ninny's Keep 'Er Going Stomp\\" recorded: the concert performer was allowed to use a pseudonym on the record. Ingle and his Natural Seven also performed with Grand Ole Opry performers such as Minnie Pearl and other Opry notables. He joined Jo Stafford on her 1949 tour of the Midwest. Despite the comedy emphasis, the quality of the musicianship was often outstanding, including in some cases Les Paul or Western Swing performers Tex Williams and steel guitarist Noel Boggs. The band also recorded short films of their numbers, before disbanding in 1952; by 1956, Ingle had formed the band once again. Retirement from music After working again with Weems, Ingle eased out of music, tiring of touring. He reunited with Jo Stafford in 1960 for a performance of \\"Tim-Tayshun\\" on Startime; by this time he had lost a great deal of weight and was barely recognizable as the former leader of the Natural Seven. He also had a reunion with Perry Como; band leader Ted Weems and former fellow band members Ingle, Elmo Tanner, Parker Gibbs and \\"Country\\" Washburn appeared as guests on Como's Kraft Music Hall on 18 October 1961. There was one last reunion with Spike Jones, an album called Persuasive Concussion (satirizing the then-popular Persuasive Percussion albums). It was never completed; Jones died in 1965. Ingle also died the same year of an internal hemorrhage. Excerpts from Persuasive Concussion, featuring Ingle, were issued on LP in the 1970s (The Very Best of Spike Jones, on the United Artists label). Ingle said he had been trying to retire from the music business since 1942; he signed up with Spike Jones a year later, and that his leaving the band in 1946 was another try at retirement. By 1948 he described himself as being resigned to staying in the field. Ingle died 6 September 1965, in Santa Barbara, California and was buried in Ovid, Michigan. References * Visser, J.

The restructured municipality of North Middlesex was incorporated on January 1, 2001. This amalgamation joined five municipalities — the townships of East Williams, West Williams and McGillivray, the town of Parkhill and the village of Ailsa Craig — to form one municipal corporation. North Middlesex has a population of 6,658 as of the Canada 2011 Census. North Middlesex is located in the north of Middlesex County, north of London, Ontario. Communities =Ailsa Craig= Ailsa Craig Ailsa Craig is a community on the Ausable River. Ailsa Craig is best known for its annual Gala Days event. The town was the home of Earl Ross, the first non-American to win a NASCAR Nextel Cup race, which he did in 1974. Earl was also NASCAR Winston Cup Rookie of the year in 1974. The winningest harness horse driver in the world also hails from the Ailsa Craig area. With over 10,000 wins, John Campbell is one of the youngest members to enter the Harness Horseman's Hall of Fame. Ailsa Craig was named by the Craig family after a namesake island in the outer Firth of Clyde, Scotland, and the word is derived from the Gaelic, Aillse Creag, or Creag Ealasaid, meaning \\"Elizabeth's rock\\". In the early 20th century, Ailsa Craig was a thriving village with several hotels, mills and served as the commercial hub for the farm businesses in the area. Located on the Grand Trunk Railway, Ailsa Craig was once the second largest cattle shipping center in all of Canada surpassed only by Calgary, Alberta. As a child, Norman Bethune often spent his summers in the village. =Parkhill= Parkhill Parkhill owes its beginning to the coming of the railway. In 1859, the Grand Trunk Railway completed a line from St. Mary's to Sarnia. The following year the first Post Office and store were opened at the present site of Parkhill. Parkhill was originally known as Westwood, named Swainsby in 1861 and finally Parkhill in 1863. Parkhill's growth was slow at first until a grist mill was constructed in the community. Other industries including saw mills, a foundry, a flax mill and a woollen mill became a part of Parkhill. By 1871, the community had a population of 1500. Parkhill was incorporated as a village in 1872 and as a town in 1886. Many fine old Victorian commercial buildings such as the Cheapside Block and Gibbs Block can be found located along Main Street. Parkhill also has many handsome churches and houses throughout the town. The township's administrative offices are located in Parkhill. =Other communities= The township also contains the communities of Beechwood, Bornish, Bowood, Brinsley, Carlisle, Corbett, Greenway, Hungry Hollow, Lieury, Moray, Mount Carmel, Nairn, Sable, Springbank, Sylvan and West McGillivray. The communities of Clandeboye, Lucan Crossing, Mooresville are divided by the municipal boundary with Lucan Biddulph.

Life  Puṇṇa Mantānīputta was born in Donavatthu, near Kapilavatthu, in a family of brahmins. His mother was Mantānī (or Maitrāyanī), sister of Ven. Añña Koṇḍañña, who became Ven. Puṇṇa's teacher. Ven. Ānanda, after his first rain retreat, mentions him as a great influence in the Ānandasuttaṃ. He says that thanks to him he was able to become a sotāpanna. Ven. Sāriputta hears about Ven. Puṇṇa for the first time through a conversation between the Tathāgata and a group of shakyans who praised him. Then Ven. Sāriputta has the chance to meet Ven. Puṇṇa at Sāvatthī, where he asks Ven. Puṇṇa about the dharma without revealing his identity. As part of his answer, Ven. Puṇṇa uses the analogy of the relay chariots in the Rathavīnitasuttaṃ. Then both reveal their names. Ven. Puṇṇa says he is called Puṇṇa, but known as Mantāniputta by his companions in the holy life, and Ven.

When asked by the Buddha what he would think if people were to assault or kill him, each time Puṇṇa Sunāparantaka explained how he would find himself fortunate. As a result, the Buddha commended Puṇṇa Sunāparantaka on his self-control and peacefulness. Puṇṇa Sunāparantaka went on to establish a thousand lay followers in the Buddha's teaching. Upon Sunāparantaka's death, the Buddha discerned that he had attained final Nibbana. References Bibliography * External links * \\"Punna\\" in the Buddhist Dictionary of Pali Proper Names.

Thomas was graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1881. He studied law with his father and at the law offices of Judges R.P. Dick and John H. Dillard at Greensboro, N.C. He was admitted to the bar in 1882 and commenced practice in New Bern, NC. Career Quickly becoming involved in politics, Thomas was elected to a term in the North Carolina House of Representatives (1887). He served as county attorney for Craven County (1890–1896). The North Carolina legislature named him a trustee of the University of North Carolina in 1893. Following passage of the new disfranchising constitution, which suppressed black voting, Thomas was elected as a Democrat from North Carolina's 3rd congressional district to the Fifty-sixth and to the five succeeding Congresses (serving March 4, 1899 – March 3, 1911).

It opened in 1915 and was demolished in 1973. History The Doric- colonnaded amphitheater was built between Amsterdam and Convent Avenues, from 136th to 138th Streets. Financier and philanthropist Adolph Lewisohn donated the money for construction. It opened in 1915, with a seating capacity of 8,000. The stadium hosted many athletic, musical, and theatrical events. It was one of New York's public landmarks. Lewisohn Stadium was demolished in 1973 to make way for the $125 million North Academic Center. In 1985, a plaza outside the Center was rededicated as the Lewisohn Plaza, in memory of the stadium and its philanthropist.Graduation ceremonies for the class of 1969 was held at the Felt Forum of Madison Square Garden. Athletics The CCNY football team played its home games at Lewisohn from 1921 to 1950. The final game played was a 33–6 Beavers victory over Lowell Textile on November 18, 1950, in front of 300 fans. (It was CCNY's only win that season, and the program was discontinued the following year.) Along with Jasper Oval (right across Convent Avenue, also now demolished), Lewisohn was used throughout the academic year for many of the college's uptown campus outdoor intramural sports. The CCNY Varsity Rifle Team had its indoor, 50' small bore range under the stadium steps, entered through a doorway at the north end. The coach, Jerrold Uretsky (Jerry), was an accomplished expert marksman with numerous medals and championships. For many years, the CCNY Rifle Team excelled in national, regional and local competition and was consistently in the NRA- sponsored Top Ten national ranking, with the best record of any team at CCNY. They traveled around the U.S. to compete against different collegiate teams as well as against Army and Navy which were the only teams they could never beat. Unfortunately, the team dissolved within 3 years of the loss of Lewisohn. The range was notoriously loud, with a steel backstop and concrete walls, and no acoustic insulation.David Keller, CCNY '67, member CCNY Varsity Rifle Team I, David Getoff, was on the team during its 1970 and 1972 years. Classical concerts Besides sporting events, the stadium was used for performances starting in 1918. Performers included Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, the Metropolitan Opera, the New York Philharmonic (sometimes called the \\"Stadium Symphony Orchestra\\"), Renata Tebaldi Kirsten Flagstad, Marian Anderson, Alfredo Antonini, and Eugene Ormandy. Leopold Stokowski made a series of recordings for Everest with the \\"Stadium Symphony Orchestra of New York.\\" George Gershwin played his Rhapsody in Blue, and premiered his Cuban Overture. Performers ranged from Van Cliburn, Jascha Heifetz, and Yehudi Menuhin to Leontyne Price, Roberta Peters, Licia Albanese, Jan Peerce, Richard Tucker, Placido Domingo, Pete Seeger, Lotte Lenya, Thomas Hayward (tenor), Harry Belafonte, Jack Benny, Benny Goodman, and conductor Kurt Adler of the Metropolitan Opera. Due to declining attendances, the concerts were discontinued in 1966. Other uses The stadium was used by City College for its commencement exercises. All CCNY campuses took part, including Liberal Arts, Engineering and Architecture, and its Manhattan Business School (now Baruch College). This practice continued through June 1973. It was also used for CCNY's annual Army ROTC's reviews at the end of each academic year. In film The stadium appeared as the setting of the final scene of the 1945 film Rhapsody in Blue in which Oscar Levant performs the title composition, with an orchestra conducted by Paul Whiteman, as a memorial to the composer. The derelict stadium was also used in the 1973 film Serpico, directed by Sidney Lumet, in a scene with Tony Roberts and Al Pacino.

(Iberia Airlines of Spain in English), usually shortened to Iberia, is the largest airline of Spain, based in Madrid. History The years following World War I saw a large advancement in aircraft technology with concomitant increase in possibilities for rapid connections between international business concerns. Germany had many business concerns, particularly in Africa and South America, but was still reliant on ships and land routes to reach these. In order to circumvent the Treaty of Versailles stipulation that prohibited German aircraft access to flying over France, agents in Spain explored the possibility an air liaison between Germany and Spain. As such Deutsche Luft Hansa on behalf of German government, established a general agreement with the Spanish government which was signed on December 9, 1927 authorizing an air service between both countries. =Early years (1927–1929)= Iberia, Compañía Aérea de Transportes was incorporated on June 28, 1927 with an initial capital investment by the financier Horacio Echeberrieta and Deutsche Luft Hansa of 1.1 million pesetas. The company obtained Government authorisation to establish commercial daily (except Sunday) connections between Madrid and Barcelona. A fleet of three Rohrbach Roland monoplanes were bought in from Deutsche Luft Hansa. Flight operations started on December 14, 1927 with inaugural flights aimed to coincide at a commemorative show in Madrid. The opening ceremony at Carabanchel aerodrome was attended by Alfonso XIII and the president of Iberia, Horacio Echeberrieta. The maiden flight from Madrid left on schedule, taking off from Madrid at 12:30 and arriving in Barcelona 3½ hours later. However the Barcelona to Madrid flight was briefly forced to stop in Almazán, Soria due to reduced visibility caused by snow. Although this flight had set off at 9:00, aiming to arrive in Madrid at midday, the delay meant it arrived in Madrid two hours after the dignitaries had already left.Breguet 27 Limousine in 1931. Within a year, the company was sponsored by the government to provide postal transport between Madrid and Barcelona. Meanwhile, Deutsche Luft Hansa was favourably rewarded for the 24% investment in the Iberia company when it was granted the regular service between Germany and Spain. On January 5, 1928 the route Barcelona – Marseilles – Geneva – Zürich – Stuttgart – Leipzig/Halle – Erfurt – Berlin was initiated. In July 1928, a twin-engined Dornier Wal was added to the fleet. This seaplane was used on a pioneering route between Cádiz and the Canary Islands. This was used to test the viability of a postal route to South America, by extending the route via Cape Verde Islands. =CLASSA and LAPE (1929–1939)= During the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera, it was proposed that the aviation companies in Spain should be combined and become state-controlled as a general interest public utility. This came into effect in early 1928. As a consequence, Iberia was merged into Compañía de Líneas Aéreas Subvencionadas S.A. (C.L.A.S.S.A.) together with the following other airlines Unión Aérea Española (U.A.E.), Compañía Española de Tráfico Aéreo (C.E.T.A.)Histaer - C.E.T.A. ( Compañía Española de Tráfico Aéreo ) the pilot training company Compañía Española de Aviación (C.E.A.)Luis Utrilla Navarro & Marcos García Cruzado (2005).

(C.L.A.S.S.A.) Although Iberia ceased activities on 29 May 1929, barely eighteen months after having begun operations, the name \\"Iberia\\" continued to be registered by Director-General Daniel de Araoz y Aréjula. Of all the airlines that formed CLASSA, Iberia would be the only one to keep in existence after the merger.Javier Vidal Olivares, Las alas de España: Iberia, líneas aéreas (1940-2005), pg. 48 Following the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931 the LAPE (Líneas Aéreas Postales Españolas) company, the airline that would replace CLASSA, became established. LAPE began operations in April 1932, CLASSA flying under the Spanish Republican Flag for one year.Historia de los Vuelos Comerciales en España Alas de la República : CLASSA , LAPE (1934) Iberia Douglas DC-3 LAPE operated even during the Spanish Civil War, mainly in its Madrid - Barcelona line, although a great part of the planes of its fleet were requisitioned by the Spanish Republican Air Force and used as military transports. As the name \\"Iberia\\" was still registered, it was used anew when airline operations began in 1937 in territory held by the rebel faction during the Spanish Civil War. In 1939, after the end of the conflict, the planes belonging to LAPE's fleet were repainted with the Iberia airline livery.Gacet Aeronáutica - Breve historia de Iberia =Post-World War II years (1939–1944)= When the Iberia company fully restarted operations following the World War II, it became a purely domestic airline. It won the right to many of the international routes, such as the service between Madrid and Lisbon; which had been previously established in early 1927 by Unión Aérea Española (U.A.E.). Bata (Ecuatorial Guinea) in 1941. One eighth of the new Iberia's capital investment was offered to Ala Littoria, fascist Italy's airline. After some deliberation, due to its negative experience in investing in the related Corporacion Sud Americana dos Servicios Aéreos, Ala Littoria decided to invest capital in Iberia in the form of two aircraft which were to join Iberia's fleet. The new Iberia's shares were held by the Spanish government (51%) and private investors (49%). Foreign interests could only own up to a maximum of 50% of the 49% of Iberia shares allocated to foreign investment. Ala Littoria purchased three Ju 52 airframes (without engines) from Lufthansa and gave them to Iberia in lieu of capital. The aircraft were put to work initially on the Rome-Venice-Munich-Berlin route. The company still had close ties with Lufthansa, which during World War II caused considerable difficulties to maintain the fleet as the import of fuel and spare parts was infrequent. In addition the Allied Powers refused cooperation with the company until connections with Nazi Germany were severed. =Nationalisation (1944–2001)= Douglas DC-4 in 1954 wearing the titles Iberia Líneas Aéreas Españolas Iberia Convair 440 at London Heathrow Airport in 1960 A Sud Aviation Caravelle seen in May 1973. Iberia Douglas DC-8s at Madrid Barajas in 1973 An Iberia McDonnell Douglas DC-10. Douglas DC-9-32 The airline was nationalised on September 30, 1944, becoming part of INI. In 1946, using the Douglas DC-4 on the Madrid to Montevideo and Buenos Aires route, it became the first airline to fly between Europe and South America after WWII. The lucrative market to South America was helped by the families separated by the Civil War. However, there was intense competition from Air France, KLM and British South American Airways. Since the company was struggling to meet domestic demand, the Government allowed another company, Aviaco, to operate the domestic routes that Iberia did not use from February 18, 1948. By the Pact of Madrid in 1953, visa requirements were eliminated for US visitors to Spain. This stimulated the commencement of transatlantic flights between Spain and United States the following year. In addition, the amendments made in Montreal to the Convention on International Civil Aviation on June 14, 1954 were liberal to Spain, allowing impetus for mass tourism using charter planes. Iberia responded to the increased traffic by acquiring a fleet of Lockheed Super Constellation long range aircraft and these served the routes to North and South America from 1954. The pressurised twin-engined Convair 440 was introduced to the company's European routes from 1957. From 1961 Iberia had a fleet of Douglas DC-8 four-engined long range jet airliners. The busiest route was Madrid to Buenos Aires. By 1965 a joint board of Iberia and Aviaco was set up to coordinate policies so that services did not conflict. In the early 1970s the company bought Douglas DC-9s and Boeing 747s as it expanded routes to Central America, Warsaw, Athens and Istanbul. In 1974 it launched Europe's first walk-on shuttle service, linking Madrid and Barcelona. That year it established the Serviberia telephone information service, the precursor of today's popular call centres, as well as the 'Red Jackets', uniformed ground staff with the mission of providing special service to customers and to resolve any problems that might arise. An Iberia Boeing 747-200. A Boeing 747-400 in 2006. Airbus A340-642 By the 50th anniversary in 1977 the airline carried over 10 million passengers in a year for the first time. There was fierce internal and political debates over the use of Douglas DC-9s or Boeing 727s; with the result that Iberia bought Boeing 727s thereby boosting Boeing's flagging production line. However this financial commitment and subsequent failure to anticipate predicted passenger numbers, caused heavy losses for the company during the 1980s. This was especially disappointing in 1982, with the visit of Pope and the football World Cup. By 1987 routes to Tel Aviv, Khartoum, Moscow and Tokyo were added. In the late 1980s/early 1990s Iberia planned a fleet renewal with the McDonnell Douglas MD-87, Airbus A320 and Airbus A340 replacing the Douglas DC-9, Boeing 727 and Douglas DC-10 respectively. A number of Boeing 757s were also bought. At this time Iberia began to build up interests in other Spanish airlines – Aviaco, Viva Air, Binter Canarias and Binter Mediterráneo – and Latin American airlines Aerolíneas Argentinas, Viasa and Ladeco. In June 1990 the company led a consortium to buy Aerolíneas Argentinas for an agreed $2billion for 85% stake and the following year bought 45% stake in Viasa for $145million. In 1991 Iberia set up Europe's first international airline frequent-flyer programme,WebFlyer Iberia review Iberia Plus, and, in 1996, the airline launched the www.iberia.com website. The company ordered 76 aircraft from Airbus in February 1998, which was largest single consignment of Airbus ordered, and bought Aviaco in 1999 and inherited its fleet. This was the start of Iberia's shift from a Boeing/McDonnell Douglas fleet to an Airbus fleet. By this stage privatisation calls from European Union and Spanish Government were being implemented. In December 1999 the company became semi-privatised with shares distributed 40% shareholders, 9% British Airways for €245million and 1% American Airlines. An initial public offering on October 2000 failed to go ahead, due to internal business difficulties, most notably the failure to offload stock in Aerolíneas Argentinas. =Privatisation (2001–2009)= Iberia is an international transportation group, operating in about 100 airports in 40 countries, employing more than 26,000 people. In 1992, Iberia celebrated its 75th anniversary making it one of the oldest airlines in the world. During those 75 years nearly 500 million people have been flown by Iberia, placing the company among the five largest European airlines, and important for routes connecting Spain with Europe and Latin America. The Iberia Group encompasses the Iberia Regional/Air Nostrum franchise. In addition to transporting passengers and freight, Iberia carries out many related activities, such as aircraft maintenance, handling in airports, IT systems, in-flight catering, and holiday packages. Iberia Group airlines fly to 97 destinations in 40 countries. Via code-sharing arrangements with other companies, it offers flights to another 60 destinations in 25 countries. With a fleet of almost 200 aircraft, it makes about 1,000 flights each day. In 2002, Iberia carried 28 million passengers and 210,000 tons of freight. In addition, Iberia is an aircraft maintenance company, servicing its own fleet and those of another 48 companies, including some European airlines. Iberia is the main supplier of aircraft handling services at all Spanish airports, with more than 200 airline clients. Iberia was a founding partner in the computerised air ticket reservation system Amadeus CRS, with an 18.28% stake – this was sold in 2008. It is also a tour operator through its Viva Tours and Tiempo Libre units, and with Cacesa it supplies package delivery services. Iberia is allied with American Airlines and British Airways, and on September 1, 2009, joined the Oneworld alliance. British Airways owns 9% of its share capital. Madrid Barajas Airport In July 2004, Iberia announced it had decided to move its Latin American hub from Miami, Florida to San Pedro Sula, Honduras. Although rumoured plans that the airline was considering to set the hub at Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport were discarded with the announcement, Iberia announced that it plans to expand its Puerto Rican schedules to connect San Juan with Central American cities. In 2005, Iberia introduced its new Business Plus Class, on its Airbus A340 aircraft. On February 5, 1990 the new Terminal 4 at Madrid Barajas was awarded to Iberia and the Oneworld alliance members. This provided expansion capabilities for Iberia. Iberia alone is responsible for around 60% of Madrid Barajas traffic. In 2005 Iberia and its regional branch Air Nostrum transported 21,619,041 passengers to/from Madrid Barajas alone. Iberia partially owns a low-cost carrier called Clickair, launched in November 2006. =Merger with British Airways (2010)= On November 12, 2009, Iberia Airlines confirmed that it had reached a preliminary agreement to merge with British Airways. The merger between the two carriers will create the world's third-largest airline in terms of revenue. On April 25, 2010, it was confirmed that British Airways and Iberia had agreed to a merger, forming the International Airlines Group, although each airline would continue to operate under its current brand. International Airlines Group, established its head office in London and its registered office in Madrid, operating mainly from its two main hubs of London Heathrow Airport and Adolfo Suárez Madrid–Barajas Airport with secondary hubs at London Gatwick Airport and Josep Tarradellas Barcelona–El Prat Airport.

The Spantax Convair 990 was able to make a successful emergency landing whilst the Iberia DC-9 crashed killing everyone on board. The accident occurred during a French air traffic controllers' strike. *On December 17, 1973, an Iberia McDonnell Douglas DC-10 registered EC-CBN overran the runway upon landing at Boston Logan after a flight from Madrid Airport.

In the meantime, she acquired a solid knowledge of flamenco styles, mainly by listening intensively to recordings of flamenco cantaores like Juan Valderrama, Manolo Caracol, Camarón de la Isla, Lole Montoya and most of all, Pastora Pavón, also known as La Niña de los Peines. She also received some formal musical training, and practised her skills as a \\"cantaora de atrás\\" (singer for flamenco dance). In 1987 she won the first prize or Lámpara Minera at the Concurso Nacional de La Unión (also known as Festival de las Minas). Two years later, she obtained the Antonio Chacón Prize (bestowed on the best malagueña at the Concurso Nacional de Arte Flamenco de Córdoba). At the same time, she started an international career after being chosen by Peter Gabriel to perform at Womad Festivals. In 1994, she recorded her first album, Muy Frágil, with guitarist Chicuelo and arrangements by Joan Albert Amargós (the later a regular contributor to other well-known flamenco musicians like Paco de Lucía and Camarón de la Isla). In 2000 she published her second flamenco recording, 'Querencia', which was nominated for the Latin Grammy Award to the Best Flamenco Album in 2001. Although already well-established as a solo cantaora, she resumed her facet as a singer for dance when she met bailaora Belén Maya in 1996, with whom she has toured the world with the works Mayte Martín + Belén Maya (since 1996) and Flamenco de Cámara (since 2003), winning international critical acclaim. In 1997, she received the Barcelona City Award, granted by the City Council, and the National Music Award in the category of \\"Best Flamenco Composer\\". In 1993 she started touring with jazz pianist Tete Montoliu, a professional relationship that lasted until Montoliu's death in 1997. Together, they offered a personal view on boleros in their live recording 'Free Boleros', recorded in 1996. In her second bolero recording, 'Tiempo de Amar', (2002), Omara Portuondo appeared as a guest artist in some of the tracks. In 2005 she celebrated her 30 years as a performing artist at the Palau de la Música Catalana, with a concert entitled 'Mis 30 años de amor al Arte', with which she is now touring Spain and other European countries. In June 2006 she takes part in an homage tour for Leonard Cohen together with Martiriio, Kiko Veneno, Javier Colis and Luz Casal, with a Spanish version of \\"Hey, That's no Way to Say Goodbye\\". The tour was later recorded in a CD called \\"According to Leonard Cohen\\". In 2007 she was requested by classical pianists duo Katia and Marielle Labeque for a project involving Spanish and classical music, which toured for several years. Other musicians like Joan Albert Amargos and Lluis Vidal who composed the arrangements for two pianos. The recording included traditional songs as well as compositions by Manuel de Falla, Federico García Lorca, Enrique Granados, Joaquín Rodrigo, Paco de Lucía, and by Mayte Martín herself. In 2009 she was requested by poet José Luis Ortiz Nuevo to compose music for the poems of Malaga-born poet Manuel Alcantara, for the flamenco festival of Málaga, which later became the CD Al cantar a Manuel, recorded with guitarists José Luis Montón and Juan Ramón Caro, percussionist Chico Fargas, among other musicians. In 2012, after breaking all ties with the recording industry, she decides to make a new recording with the help of crowdfunding, through the crowdfinancing portal Verkami. In this occasion, she records her live performances of bolero and other Latin American music in the Barcelona Venue Luz de Gas. The recording is issued with the title Cosas de dos. In 2013, with guitarists Jose Luis Montón and Juan Ramón Caro and percussionist Chico Fargas, she creates a new project for the Barcelona flamenco festival, \\"Por los muertos del cante\\", an heterodox reading of traditional flamenco songs. Her 2018 album Tempo Rubato, is a collaboration with a string quartet.  Critics' reviews  \\"A born artist. [...] An important number of cantaores of the younger generation have been influence by her. Her image is closer to that of Camarón or José Mercé than that of a typical woman cantaora, and she sings flamenco with moving sweetness and deep knowledge of the essence.\\" (José Miguel Gamboa and Pedro Calvo, Guía libre del flamenco, 2001) \\"The best female flamenco voice of her generation, undoubtedly; the most complete 'cantaora'. She sings everything, and she sings everything well. At this rate, this 'cantaora' [...] will add her name to the great ones in history.\\" (Ángel Álvarez Caballero, La discografía ideal del flamenco, 1995)  Recordings  *Muy Frágil, K-Industria Cultural, 1994 *Free Boleros, K-Industria Cultural, 1996 *Querencia, Virgin, 2000 *Tiempo de Amar, Virgin, 2002 *De fuego y de agua, KLM, 2008, with the sisters Katia and Marielle Labèque *Al cantar a Manuel, Nuevos Medios S.A 2009 *Cosas de dos, 2012 *Tempo Rubato, 2018  References   External links  *Mayte Martin's official Web (in Spanish) *Mayte Martin's link info on Flamenco World Contains some audio clips.

The area of Sioux City, Iowa was inhabited by Yankton Sioux when it was first reached by Spanish and French furtrappers in the 18th century. In 1803, during the presidency of Thomas Jefferson, France sold a vast portion of central North America to the United States of America. This \\"Louisiana Purchase\\" was largely unexplored. Jefferson sent out the Corps of Discovery, under Lewis and Clark, to scientifically document the territory. In 1804 the Lewis and Clark expedition traveled up the Missouri and set-up camp near what would become Sioux City, Iowa. On August 20, a member of the expedition, Sgt. Charles Floyd died of \\"bilous colic\\" and was buried on a bluff overlooking the river. At the time of Lewis and Clark, the Omaha tribe of Native Americans were present just downstream from this region, and the Yankton Sioux were upstream. William Thompson established a trading post near Floyd's Bluff in 1848, and had early ambitions for founding a city. However, Thompson's hopes were never realized; settlers further upriver, between the Floyd and Big Sioux rivers, met with more success. Settlement and founding Theophile Bruguier, a French- Canadian fur trader, is considered the first white settler on land that would become Sioux City. According to one legend, he told his friend Chief War Eagle of the Yankton Sioux about a dream he had regarding a rich land where two rivers joined near a high bluff. War Eagle told him that he knew of this land, near the mouth of the Big Sioux River. In reality, Bruguier had already passed this place many times in his voyages between Fort Pierre in the Dakota Territory and St. Louis, Missouri as an agent for the American Fur Company. In 1849, Bruguier established his farm on this same land; this farm included log cabins and tipis used by the family of War Eagle. Bruguier claimed all the land from the mouth of the Big Sioux River east along the Missouri River to near the Floyd River. In 1852 he sold the land from Perry Creek east to the Floyd River to Joseph Leonais. At about that time, Bruguier encouraged James A. Jackson, a fur trade outfitter from Council Bluffs (then Kanesville), to come upriver to establish a trading post. Jackson, in turn, convinced his father-in-law, Dr. John K. Cook, of the area's potential as a future city; Cook, an English-born Oxford University-educated physician turned frontier surveyor, was most impressed by the location at the mouths of the Big Sioux and Floyd Rivers at the Missouri. In his official capacity as United States Federal Government surveyor, Dr. Cook established the little town of Sioux City in 1854, staking out its lots and streets. Joseph Leonais, who owned much of the land which would become the downtown area, sold it to Dr. Cook after much haggling for $3000. Within 3 years the new town had a population of 400 people and incorporated as a city. Nineteenth century Fourth Street, looking east from Virginia. The first steamboat arrived from St. Louis in June 1856, loaded with ready-framed houses and provisions. The railroad first arrived in 1868. About that time a few small factories opened. In 1873, James Booge opened the first large-scale meatpacking plant and created a demand which ultimately led to the opening of the livestock yards (\\"stockyards\\") in 1884. The period from about 1880 to 1890 marked the most rapid and significant progress made thus far in Sioux City's development. In 1880 Sioux City had a population of 7,500.; in 1884, 15,514; in 1886, 22,358; in 1887, 30,842; and in 1890, 38,700. Street cars, water works, electric lights and other improvements appeared. Factories, jobbing houses, meatpacking plants, retail stores and railroads increasingly came on the scene. The city's building boom included an elevated railroad (the Sioux City Elevated Railway) and early \\"skyscrapers\\". These changes mirrored growth that was occurring nationwide, especially in the transition of small pioneer settlements to thriving urban centers. President Grover Cleveland visited in 1887, by then Fourth Street was the center of the business district. Sioux City is also the birthplace of the Corn Palace, a temporary building made each year as part of the Corn Festival. The Sioux City Corn Palaces were large wooden buildings with corn cobs nailed to their walls. The first Corn Palace was built in 1887, and was designed by architect W.E. Loft. The Corn Palace became larger and grander every year. The last Sioux City Corn Palace, built in 1891, sprawled across the city's downtown area. The palace had three towers, one of which stretched 200 feet tall. It also had a large tunnel, which allowed traffic to pass right beneath its center. Trade card advertisement, circa 1885 But bad weather brought a poor turnout for the 1891 Corn Festival, as the building was unheated. The Great Floyd River Flood of 1892 drowned any further hopes for the festival, and Corn Palaces were never built in Sioux City again. In May 1892, heavy rains caused the Floyd River to rise, sending a destructive wave of muddy water through the unprepared city. At least three thousand people were left homeless. The stockyards and railroad lines were all badly damaged, and a lumber yard caught fire. The final death toll from drowning was twenty-five, according to the Army Corps of Engineers. The nationwide Financial Panic of 1893 resulted in number of real estate investors and entrepreneurs in Sioux City losing great paper fortunes. Edwin Peters, the developer and promoter of Morningside, claimed to have lost $1.5 million, only to be left with a debt of $7,000. In 1898, all units of the Iowa National Guard—the 49th, 50th, 51st and 52nd Infantry Regiments, as well as artillery and cavalry units—were called to active duty in the War with Spain. The 49th and 50th entrained for South Florida but did not reach Cuba. The 51st was sent to the Philippines and engaged in combat action there. The 52nd remained stateside. Twentieth century Floyd Monument The beginning of the twentieth century saw a population of 33,000. =1900-1910= Floyd Monument In 1900, on a high bluff overlooking the Missouri River, construction began on the 100' tall Floyd Monument, a stone obelisk honoring the burial site of Sgt. Charles Floyd. Floyd died near here while exploring the region with the Lewis and Clark expedition in 1804. The monument, which was completed in 1901, was later recognized by the U.S. Department of Interior as the First National Historic Landmark, in 1960.  John Peirce fraud  In 1900, Sioux Cityans and the rest of the country were the victims of a fraud perpetrated by former Sioux City land speculator, developer, and (later) notorious wheeler-dealer John Peirce. Peirce was a colorful and flamboyant character, a decorated Union Army veteran wounded in the Civil War, and a major promoter during Sioux City's 19th Century boom years. Until fairly recently, Sioux City historians and civic promoters held Peirce in high esteem for his years of seeming dedication to the growth of Sioux City, especially of the North Side. More recent investigation has shown that in the end Peirce was a very clever scoundrel who actually got away with his crime. Like most other businessman, Peirce had been hurt very badly by the financial panic of 1893. While most of Sioux City's leading businessmen honorably spent years working and rebuilding to pay back their debts, Peirce began scheming for a way to bilk the public out of the funds he needed to effect his relocation to the west coast. In 1900, he initiated a nationwide lottery to dispose of his northside mansion (which later became the Sioux City Museum). About 40,000 tickets were sold at one dollar each. The drawing took place at the Union passenger depot on Christmas Eve of 1900. It was first announced that the winner was a jeweler from Vinton, Iowa. However, a few days later, it emerged that the winning ticket was actually held by a New York millionaire, William Barbour. (Peirce had owed a hefty financial debt to Mr. Barbour.) The abstract for the Peirce Mansion reveals that a warranty deed transferred title to Barbour nine days before the actual drawing and nineteen days before Barbour was publicly known to hold the winning lottery ticket. Barbour promptly sold the mansion to William Gordon, in exchange for bonds which were issued by the company operating the Combination Bridge. Peirce, a flamboyant figure to be sure, wrote an emotional goodbye to Sioux City in the newspaper before heading west. Peirce collected his money and disappeared from Sioux City forever. Pelletier fire On December 23, 1904, Sioux City suffered one of its greatest calamities when a fire broke out in the basement of the Pelletier Department Store on the southwest corner of Fourth and Jackson Streets. The fire ignited when a store employee lit a match in a Christmas toy display area of the basement floor to ignite a gas jet to illuminate the display. The head of the match flew off and landed in mounds of cotton that had been used to simulate snow drifts. The room went up like a torch, and the fire quickly spread throughout the multi- story building. The Sioux City Fire Department was neither manned nor equipped to suppress a rapidly spreading high-rise fire, whipped by wind gusts that quickly spread the flames to neighboring buildings. Two and a half blocks of the downtown district were gutted by fire. Only one person died in the catastrophe, but the loss in property was in the millions of dollars. Sioux City business investors lost little time in rebuilding the core business district.Disasters  Sioux City History =1911-1920=  Free speech fight  In the winter of 1914, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) chose Sioux City as the site of one of its many free speech fights. The goal was to organize both industrial and agricultural farm laborers into one big union to pressure management for better wages and shorter hours. Some community leaders—notably the enlightened Pastor and future Populist Republican Mayor Wallace Mertin Short—strongly defended the rights of the workers to exercise free speech, while not endorsing or condoning the radical and often violent tactics of the IWW. As in all of the IWW free speech fights of that era, once word of such a demonstration went out over the \\"bush telegraph,\\" thousands upon thousands of unemployed men made their way into the city by foot or on freight cars. The center of activity was in the 800 block of Fourth Street, where Sioux City Police on horseback, assisted by Iowa National Guardsmen, engaged in skirmishing. Hundreds of unemployed laborers were arrested until, jails full, city fathers bodily expelled them aboard freight cars, which delivered them to isolated locations outside the city.  First World War  When the United States declared war on Germany in April 1917, Iowa had 3 National Guard regiments, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd. The 3rd Iowa was federalized immediately as the new 168th Infantry Regiment and became part of the new 42nd \\"Rainbow\\" Division made up of guard troops from 26 states. Organized and trained at Camp Mills, New York, the 42nd was the first American combat division to reach the front lines in France. After extensive advanced combat training under supervision of French officers for a period of 90 days, the 168th entered the front lines in February 1918. Many of the members of Company L were from Sioux City, Northwest Iowa and Southeast South Dakota. Meanwhile, Company L of the 2nd Iowa Infantry Regiment, made up of National Guardsmen primarily from Council Bluffs, Sioux City and other western Iowa communities, was ordered to Camp Dodge, Des Moines in May 1917. There the Company L men joined other companies of the 2nd Iowa drawn from across the state, After getting organized and equipped at Camp Dodge from May through August, the 2nd Iowa National Guard Regiment finally embarked by troop train for Camp Cody, Deming, New Mexico—one of 32 national army training cantonments. Arriving at Cody in September 1917, the 2nd Iowa was sworn into federal service and on 28 September the old 2nd Iowa became the 133rd Infantry Regiment of the newly created 34th \\"Sandstorm\\" Division. The 34th remained in training at Camp Cody until late summer 1918, when it finally received orders to France. After a full year living and training in primitive and dust-storm conditions at this bleak desert outpost just 30 miles from the Mexican border, most of the men of the 133rd Infantry were happy to be headed overseas and desirous of getting into the fight. The division was held up at Ft. Dix, New Jersey for a couple of weeks due to the worldwide influenza pandemic, but ultimately most of the combat units of the division arrived safely in England and from there moved onward to Le Mans, France by October 1918. Upon arrival at Le Mans, the War Department determined that the 34th Division would not be needed on the Western Front and the entire division was disestablished. However, most of the infantrymen were assigned to casual detachments and sent to other army units at the front as replacements. By this time the 168th Infantry, which had arrived in France eight months earlier, had spent 174 continuous days in combat and had suffered heavy casualties in repelling the German offensive of May 1918 and during the Meuse-Argonne counter-offensive that summer. Thus, many men from the 133rd Infantry were sent as replacements to the 168th infantry, and several of these were with the Rainbow Division in its final combat action of the war—the assault on Sedan 4–9 November 1918. Following the Armistice of 11 November, these same Sioux City soldiers also were part of the 168th Infantry's \\"watch on the Rhine,\\": being stationed at Niederzeissen, Germany, until 9 May 1919. Those men who had not returned from France immediately after the Armistice were finally shipped home from Germany, arriving at Camp Dodge on the 18th of May. The men received their discharges on 19 May 1919 and returned to Sioux City. In addition to the 133rd and 168th Infantry regiments made up of Iowa National Guardsmen, hundreds more Sioux City men enlisted or were drafted into regular Army, Marine Corps and Navy units during the war. In 1919, more than 1400 Sioux City veterans of the Great War gathered to form Monahan Post No. 64 of the American Legion, named in honor of Private Edward Monahan of Sioux City, who had been the first man of the 168th Infantry Regiment killed in action in France. Private Monahan, in addition to giving his life, had distinguished himself in combat, having been mentioned in dispatches and also having been posthumously awarded the French Croix de Guerre Medal with Palm by the French government. In 1921, the city of Sioux City, in partnership with civic and veterans groups, designated a stretch of Stone Park Boulevard as the \\"Memorial Mile\\" by planting a tree to commemorate every Sioux City serviceman killed in the \\"war to end all wars.\\" =The Enlightened Governance of Wallace M. Short, 1918-1923= A Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Yale University and author of several scholarly books, Congregationalist Minister Wallace Mertin Short was far and away the most educated individual ever to have held elected municipal office in Sioux City. After crossing swords over the issue of temperance with the national elders of the Congregationalist Church and being officially de-frocked as minister of that church's Sioux City congregation, Short rented a movie house on Fourth Street and founded a successful non-denominational church open to all. He appealed to the downtrodden and dregs of society and enjoyed rubbing elbows in Sioux City taverns with common laborers. The intellectual Short suffered from severe insomnia, and made no secret of the fact that he personally consumed 1 large glass of beer every evening to help him sleep. Such an admission from a man of the cloth was considered scandalous in the extreme in that time. Short nevertheless garnered sufficient backing from organized labor to win electoral office and he went on to serve three terms as Mayor, from 1918 to 1923. Now using the Mayor's office as his pulpit, Short became a powerful spokesman for the rights of the working man and of the ethnic minorities who made up a significant percentage of Sioux City's 70,000 citizens in 1918. He embraced the Industrial Workers of the World and spoke publicly on their behalf when thousands of them congregated in the city to wage a \\"free speech\\" fight in 1914. While Short's pro-union sentiments and actions over his career resulted in an incorrect and unfair legacy of \\"socialist,\\" Short was in fact a progressive Republican who possessed a deep sense of social justice and whose faith in the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights frequently put him at odds not only with fellow clergymen but also with the large industrialists of the city. At the same time, Mayor Short's sometimes naive faith in appointed members of his city administration resulted in several scandals for which he, as chief executive, must ultimately take the blame. For example, his friendship with local labor unions resulted in the appointment of an alcoholic union boss to head the city's Department of Public Safety during his first term. When the Rush building collapsed in 1918 killing 39 citizens (see below), this Public Safety Commissioner arrived on the scene of the disaster in an inebriated condition and started handing out whiskey to the city firefighters and policemen on rescue duty. This commissioner, who had previously served as boss of the Sign Painter's Union in Sioux City, had virtually no experience in law enforcement or public safety and was eventually dismissed from his post and run out of town, apparently by friends of Mayor Short. If ever an elected representative championed Sioux City as a \\"working man's town\\" it was Wallace M. Short. Even before taking elected office, Short campaigned against the Temperance Movement and opposed Prohibition, not on moral grounds, but on the principal that alcohol consumption was a personal choice, and not something to be controlled or governed from Des Moines or Washington, D.C. Mayor Short remained a committed Republican for the remainder of his life and went on to hold office in the Iowa legislature until 1932, when the Democrats swept into office on the coat tails of Franklin Roosevelt. Although neither history nor the people of Sioux City treated the remarkable Wallace Short fairly, his administration of Sioux City during a decade of both turbulence and meteoric economic growth between 1918-1928 brought some of the best level-headed government policies that the City of Sioux City ever had...or will ever have. Sadly, not one street, building or park has ever been named in Wallace M. Short's honor.[See William H. Cumberland, Wallace Short, Iowa Rebel (Ames, Iowa: Iowa State University Press, 1983); and Wallace M. Short, Let There Be Light'(Kansas City: The Hyde Park Press, 1916) (Martin Luther King, Jr, 1917) Ruff Building/Hedges Block fire On June 29, 1918, Sioux City suffered its greatest accidental loss of life when the four- story Ruff Pharmaceutical building (the Hedges Block at Fourth & Douglas Streets) collapsed. At the time of the disaster, workmen were gutting the upper floors and preparing to lower part of the first floor to ground level. Meanwhile, retail activities had been allowed to continue at street level. The building suddenly collapsed, trapping scores of victims in the rubble. Gas mains ruptured, causing a massive fire that required 36 hours to contain. In typical city government fashion of the day, the City Public Safety Commissioner arrived on the scene and handed out bottles of whiskey to firemen and other rescuers. Thirty-nine people died in what became known as \\"the Ruff Disaster.\\" =1921-1930= The population grew to 71,227 at the 1920 census, making Sioux City the 99th largest city in the United States. In 1932 and 1933 a farmers strike occupied the city for some time, preventing food shipments in protest of very low agricultural prices. National Guardsmen of the 133rd Infantry, based at Sioux City, were called into service for 2 weeks by the Governor to patrol the strike at Cherokee, Iowa. Corruption scandal A major scandal erupted in Sioux City in 1935, two years after the Volstead Prohibition Act was repealed, when it was discovered that corrupt Iowa state officials—including the Iowa State Attorney General and leaders of the Iowa State Alcohol Control Board—were operating a profitable extortion scheme to offer \\"protection\\" to local Sioux City tavern owners in exchange for payoff money. The Attorney General was arrested, tried and convicted in the Woodbury County Courthouse. It seems that the legalization of alcohol only provided corrupt state officials waiting in the wings an opportunity to profit from Sioux City's profound love of alcoholic beverages—control over which had, until recently, been the sole domain of organized bootleggers. =1941-1950= World War Two With war clouds on the horizon in Europe, Companies L and M and the Howitzer Company (37mm antitank), 133rd Iowa Infantry Regiment were called to active federal service in 1941. Upon mobilization, the 133rd Infantry was made a part of the U.S. 34th (\\"Red Bull\\") Infantry Division, which had been deactivated by the War Department in October 1918. The Iowa guardsmen had participated in all-Army maneuvers at Camp Claiborne, Louisiana in 1940, and were among the first to be federalized. Companies L, M and the Howitzer Company, all from Sioux City, were among the first Americans sent to Europe when they landed in Londonderry, Northern Ireland early in the war. From Northern Ireland, the unit sailed for the Mediterranean Theater, where it saw its first combat in North Africa. In the first major U.S. offensive ground action against Germany in World War Two, the 34th Division was ambushed and badly mauled by German Panzer and mechanized infantry units at Kasserine Pass, Tunisia, in 1943. The division suffered horrendous casualties, including many POWs. Later reconstituted, the 34th saw subsequent combat in Italy. Air Base Early in World War II, the U.S. Army established a major training base at Sioux City, located at Sergeant Bluff, Iowa, south of downtown. New, large runways were constructed to facilitate heavy bomber operations, and the Sioux City Army Air Base became one of the prime locations for B-17 heavy bomber basic flight qualification training as well as home to various support and maintenance units. Hollywood actor and Pilot-Captain (later Colonel) Jimmy Stewart was posted to Sioux City with his squadron in 1943, where he and his crew completed their initial B-17 qualification prior to deployment overseas. Just following the war, in December 1946, the 185th Iowa Air National Guard unit was established at Sioux City. Swift Packing Plant Explosion On December 14, 1949, the large Swift & Company packing house, located north of the Sioux City Stockyards and adjacent to the Floyd River channel, suddenly exploded, killing 21 Swift employees. The cause of the disaster was never fully confirmed, but the explosion was believed to have been caused by a leaking gas pipe. In 1950 Sioux City had a population of about 84,000. =1951-1960= Missouri River flood In the spring of 1952 the Missouri River rushed out of its banks and inundated downtown Sioux City. Many area communities were also flooded. It was in the aftermath of the 1952 flood that numerous cases of polio were reported in Sioux City and throughout the tri-state area. The polio epidemic hit this region of the country especially hard and lasted until vaccine was developed to combat the disease in the late 1950s. Floyd River flood On June 8, 1953, the Floyd River again flooded when a torrential downpour in the Sheldon, Iowa area sent a wall of water down into the lower valley. Fourteen people lost their lives. This flood was a major impetus for the Floyd River flood control project, including the building of a straightened, rock-lined channel and high levee through the city. The flood-prone \\"South Bottoms\\" neighborhood was razed for this project in 1962. =1961-1970= All America City In 1962 Sioux City was named an All America City by the National Civic League. River Cade The Sioux City Chamber and other leading civic groups organized River Cade, a week-long celebration of Summer and Sioux City history in 1964. The event has been held along the Missouri River front ever since, marked by an official street parade, a carnival, boat races, children's events and a grand ball. Vietnam War In 1967, with the Vietnam War escalating under the Johnson Administration, the U.S Naval Reserve Construction Battalion (SEABEEs), based at Sioux City Naval Reserve Training Center, was called to active duty and deployed as part of Naval Construction Battalion (NCB) 2 to Danang, South Vietnam. These Sioux City Navy men frequently served under direct enemy sniper and artillery fire while engaged in building bases for the Navy and Marine Corps in the Danang area during their 13-month deployment. They served bravely, suffered casualties and returned with honor to their peacetime jobs as Sioux City construction men. U.S.S. Pueblo Incident In February 1968, in direct response to the seizure by North Korea of a U.S. Navy surveillance vessel off the coast of North Korea, the 185th Tactical Fighter Squadron, Iowa Air National Guard, based in Sioux City, was activated for federal service. The squadron deployed to Phu Cat Air Base, Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam). Members of the unit served with distinction in combat during their 12-month overseas deployment. The 185th suffered both killed in action and missing in action casualties before inactivation and return to Sioux City. Likewise in 1968, Headquarters & Headquarters Company, along with Company L, 133rd Infantry, Iowa National Guard based at Sioux City, were also placed on alert and sent into federal service at Fort Carson Colorado following the Pueblo Incident. Although anxious to deploy overseas as a fighting unit, the Iowa Guard troops—like their grandfathers of World War One—were sent to Vietnam piecemeal, as replacement troops. Some members of the Guard, including Military Policemen, deployed to South Korea. At least three Sioux City Guard members were killed in action in Vietnam during the war. =1971-1980= Urban renewal Historic Fourth Street, Downtown. The 1970s witnessed a second, decade of urban renewal in downtown Sioux City. (see the \\"South Bottoms\\"). (See \\"Historic Fourth Street\\"). It took nearly another decade to rebuild the area. Many buildings were torn down, some dating back to the 1800s. Although there was some criticism of redevelopment, this was typical in many areas with urban renewal, losing old and sometimes historic buildings. Labor unrest Labor unrest erupted yet again in Sioux City in the early 1970s with a series of strikes by union meatcutters, laborers and allied trades against the Iowa Beef Processor (IBP) Dakota City, Nebraska plant. After years of fruitless negotiations, management finally locked out union laborers, erected a shanty town of cinderblock houses on the company compound and imported Mexican laborers. This act, and the concurrent departure of the Zenith TV manufacturing plant, served as a wake-up call to the Woodbury County Labor Council, which had wielded considerable political power in its defense of Sioux City's primarily blue-collar citizenry for generations. The streamlining of meat production processes—as pioneered by IBP Corporation—and the amalgamation of job tasks, revolutionized the industry in a way that would have major repercussions for Sioux City. Within 30 years, the meatpacking industry—the industry that virtually \\"built\\" Sioux City—would all but disappear within the boundaries of Sioux City, and along with it the once- dominant Sioux City Stockyards. \\"Clean\\" industries, including manufacturing of computers, would emerge to take its place. This not only changed the culture and attitudes of city residents but demographics as well. While this was a traumatic industrial transition, most residents would agree that the changes have been very healthy for a city that was once black-balled by business developers as a tough, strike-prone, unskilled blue collar, pro-labor town. This is not to denigrate the contributions of Labor, which won many basic working rights for all Americans in several landmark strikes in Sioux City in the first half of the 20th Century. But the influx of multinational corporations like IBP, and the formation and rapid growth of Gateway Computer, brought about corporate business philosophies and global outlooks that have clearly transformed Sioux City into a cleaner and less violent city. =1981-1990= F4 tornado On July 28, 1986 an F4 tornado struck areas just west and south of Sioux City, destroying one of the four power generation plants at Port Neal, six miles (10 km) south of the Sioux City airport. No one was killed and the tornado avoided heavily populated areas. Flight 232 airline crash On July 19, 1989 a Douglas DC-10 carrying United Airlines flight 232 crashed at the Sioux Gateway Airport killing 111 passengers and one flight attendant. But due to efforts by the pilot and his crew, 185 on board survived. The airport had a full-time Air National Guard base located on it that provided 'First Recovery' fire fighters and approx 200 air guardsmen to aid in the search for survivors in the fields of corn surrounding the main fuselage section of the aircraft. They were further aided by the advanced disaster training that the city had recently completed for its emergency workers. This event was memorialized in a made-for-TV movie \\"Crash Landing - the Rescue of Flight 232\\" starring Charlton Heston as Captain Al Haynes in 1991. All America City again In 1990, due to its rescue efforts and compassion of its citizens in the Flight 232 disaster, Sioux City was again named an All America City by the National Civic League. =1991-2000= Explosion at Terra International On December 13, 1994, an explosion killed four and injured 18 at the Terra International ammonium nitrate plant at Port Neal. The explosion released a cloud of anhydrous ammonia into the air and leaked nitric acid into the ground.Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention Office The incident forced emergency evacuations in nearby areas such as Salix. The toxic cloud stayed south of Sioux City. 21st century The urban renewal of downtown during the 1970s has lost much of its impact due to suburban development, including the Southern Hills Mall. Department store J. C. Penney, moved from their downtown location in Sioux City, which opened in 1975 moved into Target's former location in 2004. The Sioux City Public Museum is renovating the building, moving from the undersized historic Pierce Mansion. In 2007, another department store, Younkers closed their location in downtown Sioux City, only choosing to operate in Southern Hills Mall. Hom Furniture has moved into this space from a much smaller store in Sioux City. Redevelopment has occurred in downtown Sioux City with the restoration of The Orpheum Theatre, which had been simply used as a movie theatre since the 1960s, until funding to restore it began in the mid-1990s. Tyson Events Center opened in 2003, replacing the 53-year-old Sioux City Municipal Auditorium, which is now a recreation center. In 2004, a 14 screen movie theatre opened, and included of retail space. The movie theatre has been profitable, however the retail space is almost completely vacant, and the building could face foreclosure. In 2005, Sioux City, along with Coon Rapids and Clinton, was awarded one of the inaugural Iowa Great Places designations. One of the major events that occurred in Sioux City in the 2010s was the addition of the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino which attracts a lot of big acts and is a main feature of the Sioux City area for the present time.

Originally released in Japanese arcades in April 2007, the title was ported to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 home consoles in Japan in May 2008, with a North American Xbox 360-exclusive version released in English in September 2008 by Aksys Games. It was later released in the PAL region in 2009 for both systems by 505 Games (Europe) and Aksys Games (Australia). A Microsoft Windows version, ported in collaboration with DotEmu and distributed via Steam, was released on July 7, 2015 as Battle Fantasia: Revised Edition. The game's development was headed by Emiko Iwasaki, who had previously served as illustrator for the company's Guilty Gear series, and features three-dimensional character models restricted to a two-dimensional plane. Battle Fantasia retains a number of features of its predecessor including fast-paced gameplay, colorful anime-style graphics, and over-the-top effects, yet was designed to be a more basic representation of the fighting genre. The game is notable for its stylistic departure from many fighting games, and is set in a fantasy world depicted as a storybook, and borrows many superficial elements from role-playing games including damage represented as numbers and a text-heavy story mode, which involves a number of heroes answering the call to battle to stop an evil force from once again attempting to destroy the world. Battle Fantasia met with relatively low sales in Japan and received mixed or average reviews from critics. Gameplay A fight between Urs and Watson showcasing the game's fantasy art style. Battle Fantasia is a traditional versus fighting game where up to two players compete against each other in combat using a variety of characters each with their own special attacks and fighting styles. While the game uses three-dimensional graphics for characters, they are restricted to a two-dimensional battle area that only allows them to move back and forth or up into the air. Players face each other in best-of-three round battles that involve the use of normal attacks, throws, and special moves that often involve combinations of button presses and directional input, which can be strung together in long combo strings. The game features four main attack buttons - two punches and two kicks - as well as a fifth \\"Gachi\\" (ガチ lit. \\"elegance\\" or \\"grace\\") button used to parry incoming attacks. If a player times a Gachi command just as an opponent's attack lands, it negates all damage and allows the player to counterattack in a brief time frame. The button can also be used to push an opponent back when combined with a direction, as well as allow the player to recover faster from a knock-down. As players deal and receive damage, they add to their MP Gauge located at the bottom of the screen, which can be stocked to a maximum of three levels. Players can expend MP to activate \\"Heat Up\\" mode to increase their strength and add additional effects to their attacks, with specific enhancements differing with each character. The gauge also allows characters to unleash powerful super moves which cause heavy damage but require spending one gauge level to activate, and can be strung together with special moves with proper timing resulting in a Super Cancel combination. Matches are won either when a player depletes their opponent's health bar, or when the time limit of each round runs out, resulting in a win for the player with the most remaining vitality. The amount of health is different for each character, and is represented by numerical hit points under each health bar.

Battle Fantasia, released in 2007 was modern innovation in 2.5D style fighting games. Battle Fantasia was developed by Arc System Works originally as a Japanese arcade game beginning in 2006. The company had previously been known for their work on the popular Guilty Gear fighting game series and was looking for ways to expand their market to a more general audience, and appointed character illustrator Emiko Iwasaki as the project's director, one of only a few women to rise to that position in the Japanese game industry. The game was the company's first title developed for the Taito Type X² arcade board hardware, and was the first game to use Taito's Vewlix arcade cabinet, which allowed the game to run in high- definition 720p resolutions. Although Iwasaki was given a large degree of freedom when making the game, she was encouraged by the company to retain many features from the Guilty Gear franchise in order to maintain their core audience, as well as being told that the game \\"needed\\" to use three- dimensional graphics in order to develop the company's 3D talent, as well as more efficiently utilize the Type X² hardware. Stylistically, the game was a departure from Arc System Works' earlier games, with Battle Fantasias colorful fantasy art direction chosen due to the popularity of role-playing games in Japan, which was overseen by graphic designer Junya Motomura. Gameplay was also made simpler when compared to other games in the genre in an attempt to bring more people into fighting games, as well expand it to the female demographic. Early beta versions of Battle Fantasia began public location tests in select arcades across Japan in October 2006, with further tests conducted over the next few months until the game's official release in April 2007. =Console ports= A home console version of Battle Fantasia was announced in a February 2008 issue of Japanese Weekly Famitsu magazine, and was confirmed for release for both the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 systems. The console releases would feature a number of new play modes, including a new, single-player story mode unique to each character, and online play over Sony's PlayStation Network and Microsoft's Xbox Live. In order to make the game more competitive, tweaks and balance changes were enacted to the game's roster, and exploits such as infinite combos were removed entirely. On May 1, a playable demo version of the game was released for the Japanese PlayStation Network, with a full commercial release for both consoles on May 29. In a July 2008 press panel, Aksys Games announced that it would be bringing Battle Fantasia to North America the following September, but only for the Xbox 360. When asked about the possibility of a PlayStation 3 version, a representative remarked that \\"We’re looking into it, but right now it’s just 360.\\" In an interview with website Gamasutra, when asked if a North American PlayStation 3 version was rejected by Sony Computer Entertainment America, Arc System Works producer Kouki Sadamori merely replied that the question was \\"a tough one to answer...\\" 505 Games signed on as the game's European publisher, who released both the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions in the region simultaneously in March 2009. Battle Fantasias late release in the region was attributed to the subject of incest being discussed during certain character's Story Mode cutscenes, which prompted the publisher to remove many alternative story paths from the game mode. The game saw a very limited release in only a few selected countries, and was originally indented to be a GBP£25 budget title, but rose to £40 after the game became exclusive to European game retailer GAME. One year after the announcement that the game would only come to North America for the Xbox 360, Aksys Games announced that it would be releasing Battle Fantasia as a full download title on the PlayStation Network in Fall 2009, with project lead Frank deWindt stating that \\"The fans have been asking for it and we're here to deliver.\\" In addition to the announcement, the company also held a contest on their official website for fans to name five new PlayStation Network achievement trophies added especially for the new release, which was made available on Sony's PlayStation Store on December 22, 2009. A new version of the game, called the \\"Revised Edition\\", was released on Microsoft Windows via Steam on July 7, 2015. It features an updated game balance. Reception The home console versions of Battle Fantasia received relatively low sales in Japan, with the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions selling 3,100 and 2,300 copies respectively during their debut week. Famitsu also gave both console versions 25 out of 40, while Famitsu Xbox360 gave the Xbox 360 version 29 out of 40. Western response to Battle Fantasia was mostly average, with the game receiving \\"mixed or average reviews\\" on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Many critics compared the title to Arc System Works' previous fighting game endeavor, the Guilty Gear series, with 1UP.com declaring that the game was more simplistic than the company's earlier works with less focus on technical aspects such as combos, and that each characters special moves were \\"flashy and not as situational\\". The website felt that many of the changes resulted in the characters being more interesting, and called the game's fantasy art motif \\"a pleasing sidestep\\" from Guilty Gears more \\"edgy\\" style, but found that most matches were slow and that the colorful art direction and Japanese voices would only appeal to a niche audience. Game Informer declared that the presentation of Battle Fantasia was charming \\"with all the vibrancy and artistic style of an anime\\", yet it did little to revolutionize the genre despite adding traditional role-playing game aesthetics such as \\"long-winded story segments\\". IGN called the game's character design \\"lighthearted and appealing\\", but that the total cast size of only twelve playable characters was relatively small compared to other fighting games, and that background designs were \\"oftentimes bland and ugly\\". In regards to the game's technical aspects, IGN felt the game lacking when compared to more high-profile titles such as Sega's Virtua Fighter 5, and that gameplay was more about \\"timing and calculated moves than massive combos or memorizing deep move sets\\". Anime News Network ranked it fourth on their list of video games that \\"deserved far more attention than they received\\", saying what \\"sets it apart is the look\\" of the backgrounds and characters. European versions of Battle Fantasia in early 2009 were often compared to Capcom's highly anticipated Street Fighter IV released just one month after. Eurogamer claimed that the game was \\"not even in the same league as Capcom's superlative re-envisioning\\", yet compared its defensive Gachi parrying system to Street Fighter III. The website would criticize the title's \\"by-the-numbers gameplay\\" and lack of online competition, and called Battle Fantasias art style \\"a nice departure, but many will find the overly twee presentation a bit too sugary for their fighter tastes.\\" Play UK also commented on the game's release, stating that \\"Six months ago we would have happily recommended it as a stopgap to Street Fighter IV, but we just can’t say that now.\\" Journalists for the magazine would pan the title's lack of gameplay options and called the story mode \\"a joke.\\" Ironically, though it was often found to be inferior to Street Fighter IV, series director Yoshinori Ono cited the original arcade version of Battle Fantasia in 2007 as the inspiration for his game's new three- dimensional art style, stating \\"Our fear was that with Street Fighter IV, because our characters are taller and more human-proportioned that it might look funky... What we learned through development was that no, it's not going to look weird... Battle Fantasia was part of what made us realize that, I think.\\" References External links ;Battle Fantasia *Official website ;Battle Fantasia: Revised Edition * Category:2007 video games Category:505 Games Category:Arc System Works games Category:Arcade games Category:Fantasy video games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:NESiCAxLive games Category:Versus fighting games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games with 2.5D graphics Category:Video games with cel-shaded animation Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Windows games ","title":"Battle Fantasia"},{"id":"7713579","text":"Max Lüscher (2005) Max Lüscher (September 9, 1923 – February 2, 2017Death Notice) was a Swiss psychotherapist known for inventing the Lüscher color test, a tool for measuring an individual's psychophysical state based on his or her color preferences.

After this, working as a psychotherapist, Lüscher created his first color test which was published in 1947. This test used color cards to determine the current emotional state of the test-taker.Ubran, D. (2014, July 22). Who Are We and Why? The Lüscher Color Test. Retrieved February 9, 2017, from http://www.schirn.de/en/magazine/context/who_are_we_and_why_the_luescher_color_test/ From 1961 to 1965, Lüscher lived in Berlin and continued his career as a psychotherapist. Lüscher was noted for his guest lectures and training seminars for physicians. The \\"Lüscher Color-Diagnostics\\" are now used in several universities across the world. The Lüscher test colors The test colors from the Lüscher Color-Diagnosis chosen based on favoritism. The test- taker chooses the card color they like best and then orders the rest from most-preferred to lease-preferred. Numbers are printed on the backside of each card, and after the test-taker orders them, the examiner turns them over and references an accompanying book that contains all of the different number combinations and their meaning. Lüscher argues that the subject's choice of color shows the state of their psychosomatic and emotional status and how they feel about themselves. Lüscher relates to his four fundamental colors to the following fundamental categories: *Blue: ContentmentSee and hear Contentment :Feeling of belonging, the inner connection and the relationship to one’s partner. :\\"How I feel towards a person that is close to me\\" *Green: Self- respectSee and hear Self-respect :Inner control of willpower and the capacity to enjoy. :\\"The way I want to be\\" *Red: Self confidenceSee and hear Self confidence :Activity, drive and the reaction to challenges. :\\"How I react to challenges\\" *Yellow: DevelopmentSee and hear Development :Attitude of anticipation, attitude towards future development and towards new encounters. :\\"What I expect for the future\\" A 1984 comparison of the Lüscher color test and the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory found little agreement between the two tests, prompting the authors to urge cautious use of the former.

The book deals primarily with black magic and the lure of evil. Other themes include friendship, love, and death. It won the Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis (Prize for Literature for Young People) in 1972. Publication History The book was first published in 1971 and in an English translation first as The Satanic Mill from 1972 to 1991, then republished in 2000 as The Curse of the Darkling Mill, in 2011 as Krabat and in 2014NYRB Children's Collection publication page as Krabat and the Sorcerer's Mill. Plot Set in the mid 17th century during the Thirty Years' War, the story follows the life of Krabat, a 14-year-old Wendish beggar boy living in the eastern part of Saxony. For three consecutive nights, he is called to a watermill near the village Schwarzkollm through a dream. Upon heeding the call and arriving at the mill, he begins his apprenticeship as a miller's man. He soon joins the secret brotherhood, composed of journeymen and apprentices, and discovers that the skill he is meant to learn through this apprenticeship is Black Magic. The first magic powers Krabat acquires are rather harmless, such as the ability to turn himself into a raven. Other peculiarities of this watermill include the lack of any outside visitors, including farmers who would have brought grain. The only visitor to the mill is one Goodman, who may be the devil, although this is never made explicit. The senior journeyman Tonda, Krabat's best friend and older brother figure, dies, ostensibly of an accident, on New Year's Eve in Krabat's first year at the mill. Tonda offers strangely little resistance to his own death. Krabat's suspicions of foul play are further reinforced when another journeyman and friend, Michal, dies the following New Year's Eve. He soon realizes that the master is bound in a pact to the Goodman: the master must sacrifice one journeyman every year on New Year's Eve, or perish himself. Wishing to take revenge for his friends' death, Krabat secretly trains to increase his magical strength so he can fight the master. His quest is aided by a girl from the nearby village, a church singer, “Kantorka”, whose name is never mentioned (“Kantorka” meaning just ‘little chorister’). Krabat learns that to end the spell, his lover must challenge the master for him; then whoever loses the challenge, the master or the two lovers, will die. The master offers Krabat another solution: He will retire and let Krabat inherit the mill, along with the pact to the Goodman; but Krabat refuses to perpetuate the evil pact. So the challenge goes ahead, and the girl's task is to distinguish Krabat from the rest of the journeymen, all of them are standing in a row, while she is blindfolded. She manages to pick him out by the fact that he fears mainly for her life, while the others fear mainly for their own. Ultimately, she rescues Krabat from death, and they and the journeymen escape the mill. The master is left to die in the burning mill on New Year's Eve, while the survivors lose all their magic powers and are now simple millers who have to provide for themselves through normal hard work.  Characters  The characters of this novel provide a stark distinction between good and evil. Krabat, his love interest the Kantorka, Tonda, Juro and Michal stand for the side of the good, whereas the master of the mill, the Goodman and the one journeyman who betrays his brothers stand for the bad. There are, however, a few journeymen who are indifferent or ambiguous to the ongoing struggle, and who neither support nor oppose the master.  Interpretation  Although the story is quite close to the original Sorbian tale of Krabat that dates back to the 18th century, Preußler himself also considered it to tell the story of himself, his generation, and all young people who encounter power and its temptations and get ensnarled by it.Preußler's website Adaptations The story was adapted into a 1977 Czechoslovakian animated film, Čarodějův učeň (The Sorcerer's Apprentice), directed by Karel Zeman. The band ASP started with a musical version of the story, in 12 parts, in 2006. In 2008 they finished the project with a 15-track album (on two CDs) called Zaubererbruder (i.e. \\"Sorcerer-Brother\\"). Marco Kreuzpaintner's film adaptation of Otfried Preußler's book, also named Krabat, was released in Germany on October 9, 2008. The 1975 East German television film Die schwarze Mühle is based on a different novelization of the same folk tale by Jurij Brězan. It aired on Fernsehen der DDR starring Polish Actor Leon Niemczyk, dubbed for the GDR tv viewers by Norbert Christian, Monika Woytowicz, Herbert Köfer, Uwe Kockisch, and Ernst-Georg Schwill.

Biography Landau lived in the second half of the 15th century. His father was one of the chief authorities on the Talmud in Germany; hundreds of Talmudists, among them naturally his son, were his pupils. Landau left Germany and settled in Italy, living first in Pavia (1480) and then in Naples (1487). Works In Naples, some time between 1487 and 1492, he published his code Agur. He composed this for his pupil Ezra Abraham b. David Obadiah, because, the latter's time being devoted to physics and metaphysics, he could not enter deeply into the study of the Talmud (see introduction to Agur). This practical consideration determined the form of the Agur, which contains only those rules that a layman should know, and comprises principally an abridged presentation of the material treated in the first and second parts of the Turim. The author of the Turim, Jacob ben Asher, is Landau's chief authority, and the Agur may be considered really as a supplement to that work. In the Agur, Landau gives excerpts from the halakhic literature which appeared after the time of Jacob ben Asher. Although the Agur possesses little originality, it held an important position among law codes, and is often quoted, especially by Joseph Caro in the Shulchan Aruch. German influence on the religious practices of the Italians was increased by Landau's work, such authorities as Jacob Mölin, Isserlein, and other Germans having been little noticed by Italians before him. The Agur was the first Jewish work to contain a rabbinical approbation, besides being the second Hebrew book printed during the author's lifetime. At the end of the Agur, Landau gave a number of conundrums relating to halakhah, under the title \\"Sefer Chazon,\\" which were afterward published separately (Venice, 1546; Prague, 1608). At the end of the preface the author explains three reasons for naming it the 'Agur. The senses of Agur he used are (1) hunkering, referring to his humility; (2) a heap, as it is a collected digest; and (3) dwelling, referring to the \\"tents of Shem\\" which represent Torah study (Gen. 9).

Early life Hodge was born in Leigh- on-Sea, Essex in 1929, and attended Minchenden Grammar School in Southgate, London. He studied at the Northampton Engineering College at the University of London, graduating in 1949 with a first-class degree in engineering. From 1950 through 1952 he worked as an engineer at Vickers-Armstrong in Weybridge. Upon graduation, Hodge worked as an engineer for the Aerodynamics Department of Vickers-Armstrongs. In 1952 Hodge took a job at the Avro Arrow project in Canada, where he was head of the air loads section.http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/HodgeJD/JDH_BIO.pdf NASA career John Hodge (bottom left) with Glynn Lunney and James Beach during Gemini 3. When the Avro Arrow project was cancelled in 1959, 32 Avro engineers including Hodge followed the lead of Jim Chamberlin and migrated to join NASA's Space Task Group. The group, based at Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, was responsible for America's manned space program, Project Mercury. At Langley, Hodge became the assistant to Chris Kraft, who was the head of the Space Task Group's operations division and NASA's first flight director.Chris Gainor, ‘’Arrows to the Moon: Avro's Engineers and the Space Race.’’ Collector's Guide Publishing Inc., 2001. pp. 43-58, 74-87. During John Glenn's historic 1962 Friendship 7 mission, the first orbital flight by an American, Hodge was serving as the flight director at NASA's tracking station in Bermuda.Chris Gainor, ‘’Arrows to the Moon: Avro's Engineers and the Space Race.’’ Collector's Guide Publishing Inc., 2001. pp. 87-89. The final flight in the Mercury program, MA-9, was scheduled to last long enough that a second flight director was needed in Mission Control. Thus, in 1963, Hodge became a flight director, choosing blue as his team color. The missions that he worked included Gemini 8, where he was the first person other than Kraft to be lead flight director for a mission. Hodge was on-shift when a stuck Gemini thruster brought a rapid end to the mission. He was also on-duty during the launch test that resulted in the Apollo 1 fire.Chris Gainor, ‘’Arrows to the Moon: Avro's Engineers and the Space Race.’’ Collector's Guide Publishing Inc., 2001. pp. 90, 109-128, 150-152. Hodge retired as a flight director in 1968, and became head of Johnson Space Center's advanced program office where he worked on preparing for the last three Apollo lunar landings and programs to follow Apollo. He left NASA in 1970 but returned in 1982 to run a large space station design study. When Space Station Freedom began in 1984, Hodge was named NASA’s Associate Administrator for Space Station, a post he held until leaving NASA in 1987.http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/HodgeJD/JDH_4-18-99.pdf Career outside NASA After leaving NASA in 1970, Hodge worked for the Transport Systems Center, Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the Urban Transportation Development Corporation in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, before serving five years as an administrator at the United States Department of Transportation. After leaving NASA in 1987, Hodge then formed his own firm, J. D. Hodge and Company, which was an international management and aerospace consultanting company. In Film Hodge was portrayed by Jim Piddock in the 1998 miniseries From the Earth to the Moon. He was portrayed by Ben Owen in the 2018 film First Man.

Music career Howard was born September 15, 1956 in Philadelphia. In the late 1970s, he toured with Grover Washington, Jr., who was one of his idols. In the early 1980s, Howard released his first and second studio albums, Asphalt Gardens and Steppin' Out. Both albums were well received and ranked high on the Billboard magazine jazz album charts at No. 25 and 9, respectively. The last track on 'Steppin' Out' is called 'Dream Ride' and features George playing clarinet. The track was promoted in 1984 in the UK by DJ Robbie Vincent and is now a classic among soul and jazz enthusiasts. By 1985, his third album, Dancing in the Sun, had scaled the Billboard Jazz Album chart to No. 1. Each of his next three albums, Love Will Follow, A Nice Place to Be, and Reflections would also reach this height in the Jazz Album chart. After the success of Dancing in the Sun, Howard left GRP Records to join MCA Records through the 1988 release of Reflections. His next album Personal was released in 1989. However, he returned to GRP in 1990 and released Love and Understanding in 1991. It was followed by Do I Ever Cross Your Mind? (1992), When Summer Comes (1993), A Home Far Away (1994), and Attitude Adjustment (1996). His first five years with GRP, plus a selection of his MCA recordings, were summarized on 1997's The Very Best of George Howard and Then Some. Howard returned to recording with Midnight Mood, which was released in January 1998, his final album before his death two months later. He stayed with GRP until his death from colon cancer on March 20, 1998. His final album, There's a Riot Goin' On was released by Blue Note Records one month after his death. Howard was survived by his daughter, Jade Howard, and two sisters, Mary Howard and Doris Beverly.

History The school was founded in 1963 under the name DuPont de Nemours Private School. As part of a deal with the Luxembourg government to open Europe's first polyester film plant in the country the American conglomerate DuPont requested that its employees have access to an American- style education for their children. Classes were first located in the dining room of a private home in Strassen, before moving, in early 1963, to a single classroom at a primary school in Cessange. Soon after, the Luxembourg government offered to the school classrooms at Servais House at the junction of Avenue Maria-Teresa and Boulevard Joseph II, where the school remained for six years. Seeing the school as a draw for other international firms, the Luxembourg government continued to support its development. In 1969, it gave the school access to a new building on rue Aloyse Kayser, in Belair. The same year it was taken over by international firm Goodyear and renamed the English Speaking School of Luxembourg. In 1972, with student numbers growing, the school moved to the premises of the Lycée Michel Rodange in Hollerich, where it took the name the American School of Luxembourg and became a not-for-profit organisation. From 1977 to 1999 the school was located at 188 Avenue de la Faiencerie in Limpertsberg, where it adopted the name, the American International School of Luxembourg. In 1999, the school settled into its current purpose built location in Hollerich on the Campus Geesseknäppchen, which hosts several other Luxembourg-based educational establishments. That same year the school adopted its present name, the International School of Luxembourg. Structure and student body The school is divided into a lower school and upper school. The lower school consists of an Early Years Programme serving children aged 3–7, which includes the Preschool, Kindergarten and Grade 1, whilst the rest of the lower school programme serves ages 7–11 in Grades 2-5. The upper school consists of a middle school of Grades 6-8, serving ages 11–14, and a high school comprising Grades 9-12 serving ages 14–18. , ISL's student body consists of approximately 1,300 students representing close to 50 nationalities. On average, students remain enrolled in the school for between 3 and 5 years. Sports and extracurricular activities ISL is a member of the Northwest European Council of International Schools (NECIS) Sports Council, which coordinates varsity athletics competitions amongst its members. ISL fields teams in volleyball, soccer/football, cross country, basketball, swimming, skiing, track and field, tennis, girls soccer/football, rugby, and coed softball. The team goes by the name of the Eagles. The International School of Luxembourg participates in and manages the Global Issues Network.

When used, they are packed with a desiccant, usually calcium chloride. A drying tube or guard tube is a tube- like piece of apparatus used to house a disposable solid desiccant, wherein at one end the tube-like structure terminates in a ground glass joint for use in connecting the drying tube to a reaction vessel, for the purpose of keeping the vessel free of moisture.CUBoulder Organic Chemistry. Glassware: Drying Tubes. Consulted on 17 November 2011. http://orgchem.colorado.edu/equipment/glassware/drytube.html The tube-like structure is often bent and can also widen to form a bulb/desiccant reservoir. Typically a drying tube is 1–2 cm wide and 5–10 cm long and bent at an angle of about 90 degrees. In use, the drying tube is filled with a rechargeable desiccant such as calcium chloride, and the open end of drying tube is partially blocked (e.g. with wool, glasswool or a bung/cork which has a small bore made in it) and the drying tube is connected to the apparatus to be kept dry via the ground glass joint. If the drying tube is bent the bend is oriented so that solid desiccant does not fall into the reaction vessel. Some drying tubes have a glass sinter to prevent desiccant falling into the reaction vessel. Drying tubes are often prepared in advance and the desiccant can be replaced when exhausted. Reactions which are being heated, or which evolve gases, must never be sealed because an overpressure may shatter the vessel. Drying tubes are usually fitted on top of the reflux condenser, allowing the pressure to be relieved while excluding atmospheric moisture.Unidata. Drying Tubes. Consulted on 17 November 2011. Drying tubes are often used in less-demanding applications, typically in organic syntheses. While the reaction is often carried out at room temperature, the solvent, usually volatile diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran is already able to displace air directly, making additional measures to exclude atmospheric moisture less important. An oil bubbler may be a useful substitute. In this case, gases are allowed to escape, but air is not able to enter because the bubbler acts as a one-way valve. Oil bubblers can tolerate an underpressure in the reaction vessel. Oil is sucked into a sump in lieu of air. However, if the pressure in the reaction vessel falls too low, the oil may be sucked into the reaction vessel, contaminating it.Microscale glassware. Evergreen Academic. Consulted on 17 November 2011. http://orgchem.colorado.edu/equipment/glassware/drytube.html For more demanding applications, a Schlenk line or glovebox may be used to provide an atmosphere of dry, inert gas such as argon or nitrogen.

Neighborhoods =North Side= *The North Side is the colloquial reference to the mostly residential neighborhood north of about 18th Street and ending near North High School. The former home of the Sioux City Public Museum, the historic John Peirce house, is a fine example of a Victorian home in this neighborhood; it was built from Sioux Falls rose quartzite (see Sioux Quartzite for the rock unit) in 1890. *The Near North Side is the area just north of the main downtown business district, extending from 7th or 8th Street up to 14th Street, and bordered by Floyd Boulevard to the east and McDonald Street to the west. The Cathedral of the Epiphany, with its impressive twin spires, and adjacent Bishop Heelan Catholic High School are located in the Near North Side. The great stone \\"Castle on the Hill,\\" formerly Central High School, is likewise in this neighborhood. *Indian Hills starting at 27th and Cheyenne Boulevard, extending to North Outer Drive to the north and Floyd Boulevard to the east. Homes in this area were built between the 1960s and 1980s. *Country Club is bordered by Hamilton Boulevard to the east and 36th Street to the south, and extends up the Perry Creek valley to the Plymouth County line. Characterized by traditional mansions and sprawling ranch style houses. *Leeds is a mostly residential neighborhood northeast of downtown Sioux City, centered near 41st Street at Floyd Boulevard. North–south streets in Leeds are named after American presidents. *Rose Hill is a neighborhood characterized by large, century-old houses. It is roughly bordered by 12th Street to the south, McDonald Street to the west, Jackson Street to the east, and Grandview Park to the north. It is dotted with ethnic restaurants, laundromats and trendy coffee houses, tattoo parlors, pool halls, tiny art galleries, and import shops. *Gilman Terrace is a neighborhood lining the 19th Street corridor as it cuts through the bluff and descends westward from the Heights toward Hamilton Boulevard. It formerly included one of the city's most popular parks with a public athletic field and outdoor skating rink in winter, as well as Heelan High School's Memorial Field. Today it is home to a strip mall and Memorial Field. *The Heights lies between Grandview Park and Hamilton Boulevard, including East and West Solway, Kennedy Drive, and McDonald Drive. In this area are large estates from the 1890s to 1940s including Prairie School, Victorian, Georgian, and Colonial homes. =East Side= *Kelly Park, including Cole's Addition, is a blue-collar residential area centered on the municipal park of the same name. It is situated directly east of Highway 75 and spans several blocks of eastern Sioux City from East 7th to about East 18th Street. *Springdale is a smaller neighborhood along 28th Street on the east side of Sioux City, near the Floyd River. *Greenville is a neighborhood corresponding to the lower Bacon Creek valley along Old Correctionville Road and also includes residences and small businesses along the original Floyd River channel just upstream from the Stockyards. It is home to the historic Floyd Cemetery. *Morningside is the blanket term for the hilly southeast quadrant of Sioux City. Morningside is somewhat demarcated by old U.S. Highway 75 (at South Lewis Blvd.) at the western end and old U.S. Highway 20 (at Gordon Drive) on the northern end. It was originally a streetcar suburb in the late 19th century. Morningside was originally promoted by the entrepreneur and settler Edwin Peters, who made his home near the original commercial center of the suburb, known as \\"Peters Park\\". Peters Park was also the location of the fine Victorian home of Arthur Garretson, which was situated at the eastern terminus of the Sioux City Elevated Railway. For many years, the elegant Garretson mansion served as the Morningside Public Library. However, in the 1960s it was razed amidst much controversy, and replaced by a modern structure. Peters Park is also home to Morningside College, founded in 1894. Today Morningside is a large sprawling area of Sioux City containing numerous distinctive neighborhoods. As a whole, Morningside is a mix of older residential neighborhoods and commercial corridors. Peters Park is the historical commercial center of Morningside, although a boom of commercial development in the Southern Hills area over the past 20 years has dwarfed Peters Park's own commercial area. *Polack Hill is a Morningside neighborhood. The district is situated on one of the highest bluffs in the city at the westernmost edge of Morningside, and is bounded roughly by Pulaski Park and South Lewis Blvd. on the west, South Helen St. on the east, Vine Avenue on the south and Gordon Drive on the north. Historic St. Casimir's Church, built by the Lithuanian immigrants in 1915, was located near the north end of this neighborhood. *Cecelia Park is a small district in west-central Morningside dominated by a municipal park, a traffic turnabout and a small but thriving commercial area. Cecelia Park lies some 1.5 miles north of Peter's Park, at the northwestern end of Morningside Avenue. *Southern Hills is the newest area of residential development in Morningside, as well as being the dominant commercial district of the city. *Sunnyside is the area between Bushnell and Seger Avenues and bordered by Morningside Avenue and Lakeport. *Singing Hills is the new development that begins south of Singing Hills Boulevard and is bordered by Old Lakeport Road and Highway 75. =West Side= *The West Side is the blanket term for the areas west of Wesley Parkway, where the numbered streets are named West 4th Street, West 14th Street, etc. It is a mix of low- income and middle-class residential neighborhoods. Liberty, Emerson, Riverside, and Crescent Park Elementary schools as well as West Middle School and West High School serve this area of Sioux City. *Riverside is a flat, blue collar residential area on the west side of Sioux City, along the banks and floodplain of the Big Sioux River. Riverside is historically significant as the site of original land holdings of the first white settler in the territory-- Theophile Bruguier—whose farm included hundreds of acres running from the mouth of the Big Sioux River northwest toward the South Dakota state line—much of that area which today comprises suburb of Riverside. *Smith-Villa is a neighborhood on the upper west side of Sioux City generally bounded by West 20th Street on the north, Villa Avenue on the south, Center Street and Perry Creek on the east and West Street on the west. Smith Elementary School has served this area since 1899, and was built as a mansion in 1892.http://www.siouxcityschools.org/vnews/display A new school is being built around the mansion, and it is planned to be torn down after the new school opens. The new school, Liberty Elementary School, opened its doors in 2011. It also replaced Everett Elementary School.http://www.siouxcityschools.org/vnews/display.v/ART/4acbaae1376cb?in_archive=1 *Prospect Hill, located on the lower west side of Sioux City is one of the city's oldest residential neighborhoods, situated within walking distance of downtown. It is bordered on the west by Cook Street, on the north by West 3rd Street, and on the east and south by the hill's edge. A monument erected by Christian missionaries is situated at the top of the hill, which also provides a panoramic view of the city as well as South Sioux City, Nebraska, Union County, South Dakota, and the Missouri River. *Woodbury Heights, a newer development located in the hills on the western side of Sioux City. This area is bordered by W. 4th and Burton Streets, with Fieldcrest Drive being the main entrance to the neighborhood. =Former neighborhoods= *The South Bottoms was a working-class neighborhood located west of the stockyards that was later destroyed to make way for Interstate 29 and a channelization project on the Floyd River. A South Bottoms Memorial was created in 1997 to honor the immigrants and families who made this area of town their home.  Commercial districts  *Downtown is the main business district. It extends from the Riverfront up to about 8th Street, and is flanked by the West Side and by Floyd Boulevard. Many buildings of architectural and historical interest are located here, including the Woodbury County Courthouse. The Courthouse is on the National Register of Historic Places and is a National Historic Landmark. It was designed in the Prairie School style by Sioux City architect William L. Steele in collaboration with Minneapolis architects William Purcell and George Elmslie. Steele, a protégé of Louis Sullivan, was active in Sioux City during the early twentieth century and has a large body of work represented there. :Also located downtown is the Orpheum Theater, originally designed by the Chicago architects Rapp and Rapp, and built in 1927. The Orpheum was renovated in 2001 and has since hosted Broadway shows, international musical performers, and on special occasions, the Sioux City Symphony Orchestra. The Tyson Events Center is located near the riverfront, and is a 10,000-seat venue for conventions, entertainment, and sports events; it is the home of the Sioux City Musketeers, a team affiliated with the United States Hockey League - an amateur hockey league. Historic Fourth Street *Historic Fourth Street (also called \\"Lower Fourth Street\\") is a district on the east side of the main downtown area that is enjoying a renaissance. It is home to many of the older commercial buildings in the city, many of them designed in the Richardsonian Romanesque style, and of considerable architectural importance. From the 1880s to the early 20th century, this was a high-property-value district, containing magnificent buildings such as the Peavey Grand Opera House, the New Oxford Hotel, the Plymouth Block, the Chicago House Hotel & Convention Center, and many other grand and architecturally unique structures. *The Stockyards is an historically important district located along the original lower Floyd River channel. Formerly one of the largest livestock trading facilities in the world, the Sioux City Stockyards was also home to large meatpacking plants (or \\"packing houses\\"), including Armour and Company and Swift and Company, who employed a significant number of residents. In its heyday, the Stockyards commercial corridor included the historic Livestock Exchange Bank as well as the offices of cattle companies, tack-and-saddleries, boot and western wear stores, lumber yards and hardware stores, restaurants and saloons. Following the closure of most of the meatpacking plants, and of the livestock yards themselves, the area became inactive, with only a few small businesses remaining. However, recently a very large retail lumber and home improvement center opened here, possibly a harbinger of economic revitalization for the district. *Southern Hills is a large, newer commercial area of shopping malls and self-standing restaurants, shops, banks, medical and dental clinics, and other service industries. Sioux City's largest shopping mall, Southern Hills Mall, and several additional smaller strip malls anchor a commercial district. It is located on the southern fringe of Morningside in the Loess Hills. This area began development in the late 1970s and is still actively growing in the recent decade with two new shopping centers, both named Sunnybrook Place, and the more recent Lakeport Commons.

He was the son of a king and the father of a king, but the relation of his dynasty to the previous one is disputed. His realm included the lower reaches of the Borysthenes and Hypanis, as well as the northern part of Crimea, where his capital, Scythian Neapolis, was situated. Skilurus ruled over the Tauri and controlled the ancient trade emporium of Pontic Olbia, where he minted coins. In order to gain advantage against Chersonesos, he allied himself with the Sarmatian tribe of Rhoxolani. In response, Chersonesos forged an alliance with Mithridates VI of Pontus. Skilurus died during a war against Mithridates, a decisive conflict for supremacy in the Pontic steppe. Soon after his death, the Scythians were defeated by Mithridates (ca. 108 BC). Either Skilurus or his son and successor Palacus were buried in a mausoleum at Scythian Neapolis; it was used from ca. 100 BC to ca. 100 AD. Pseudo-Plutarch, in Sayings of Kings and Commanders, reports the following version of the Aesopic fable \\"The Old Man and his Sons\\": \\"Scilurus on his death-bed, being about to leave eighty sons surviving, offered a bundle of darts to each of them, and bade them break them.

Although similar to the Burlington SS in some respects, the GCS Hawke was developed completely independently by the partners in GCS Cars with considerably different dimensions overall. The Dorian/Burlington was designed to fit on a Triumph chassis, although Dorian later developed a chassis that it is believed was using Escort parts. The GCS Hawke was designed to fit on a ladder-frame chassis to accept Cortina/Sierra parts. This led to the bodyshell and wings being considerably wider than the original Dorian/Burlington car. It is an open two seater modelled fairly closely, but differently enough, on the Morgan. Whereas the Burlington body tub was constructed of glass-fibre, wood and aluminium, the Hawke has a one- piece GRP bodyshell with integral floor. It can take a variety of engines from Ford and the V8 Rover. The company was founded by Garry Hutton and Collin Puttock. The company was eventually sold to Tiger Racing but then sold to LCD (LC Developments Ltd founded in 2003 by Richard John Laking and Paul John Chapman) who currently both manufacture the car and supply the car as a kit.

Taxonomy  The genus was established in 1837 by John Edward Gray in a revision of material at the British Museum of Natural History. Gray nominated his earlier description of Kangurus pencillatus as the type species, now recognised in the combination Petrogale penicillata (brush-tailed rock-wallaby). The author separated the species from the defunct genus Kangurus, which he proposed to divide in his synopsis of the known macropod species. The following is a list of species, with common names, arranged by alliances of species groups: * Genus Petrogale ** P. brachyotis species group *** Short-eared rock-wallaby, Petrogale brachyotis *** Monjon, Petrogale burbidgei *** Nabarlek, Petrogale concinna *** Eastern short-eared rock-wallaby, Petrogale wilkinsi ** P. xanthopus species group *** Proserpine rock-wallaby, Petrogale persephone *** Rothschild's rock-wallaby, Petrogale rothschildi *** Yellow-footed rock- wallaby, Petrogale xanthopus ** P. lateralis/penicillata species group *** Allied rock-wallaby, Petrogale assimilis *** Cape York rock-wallaby, Petrogale coenensis *** Godman's rock-wallaby, Petrogale godmani *** Herbert's rock- wallaby, Petrogale herberti *** Unadorned rock-wallaby, Petrogale inornata *** Black-flanked rock-wallaby, Petrogale lateralis *** Mareeba rock-wallaby, Petrogale mareeba *** Brush-tailed rock-wallaby, Petrogale penicillata *** Purple-necked rock-wallaby, Petrogale purpureicollis *** Mount Claro rock- wallaby, Petrogale sharmani Description A genus with a high degree of speciation, driven in part by their fidelity to complex habitats that are phylogeographically isolated, Petrogale is the most diverse macropod genus, with workers identifying 19 species and further cryptic taxa in taxonomic revisions to 2014. The species occur in a weight range of 1–12 kilograms, relatively small to medium-sized marsupials. The medium-sized, often colourful and extremely agile rock-wallabies live where rocky, rugged and steep terrain can provide daytime refuge. Males are slightly larger than females, with a body length of up to 59 cm and a 70 cm long tail. Rock-wallabies are nocturnal and live a fortress-like existence spending their days in steep, rocky, complex terrain in some kind of shelter (a cave, an overhang or vegetation) and ranging out into surrounding terrain at night to feed. The greatest activity occurs three hours before sunrise and after sunset. Habitat Their reliance on refuges leads to the rock-wallabies living in small groups or colonies, with individuals having overlapping home ranges of about 15 hectares each. Within their colonies, they seem to be highly territorial with a male's territory overlapping one or a number of female territories. Even at night, the rock-wallabies do not move further than two kilometres from their home refuges. Generally, there are three categories of habitat that the different species of rock-wallaby seem to prefer: *Loose piles of large boulders containing a maze of subterranean holes and passageways *Cliffs with many mid- level ledges and caves *Isolated rock stacks, usually sheer sided and often girdled with fallen boulders Suitable habitat is limited and patchy and has led to varying degrees of isolation of colonies and a genetic differentiation specific to these colonies. The rock wallaby height is ranges from 60 cm to 70 cm. Species decline Their total numbers and range have been drastically reduced since European colonisation, with populations becoming extinct in the south. The ongoing extinction of colonies in recent times is of particular concern. In 1988 at Jenolan Caves in New South Wales, for example, a caged population of 80 rock-wallabies was released to boost what was thought to be an abundant local wild population. By 1992, the total population was down to about seven. The survivors were caught and enclosed in a fox and cat-proof enclosure, and the numbers in this captive population have since begun to increase. Scientists consider red foxes the major reason for the recent extinctions, along with competing herbivores, especially goats, sheep and rabbits, diseases such as toxoplasmosis and hydatidosis, habitat fragmentation and destruction, and a lower genetic health due to the increasing isolation of colonies. Recovery and conservation Allied rock wallabies being fed on Magnetic Island Habitat conservation and pest management addressing red foxes and goats appear to be the most urgent recovery actions to save the various species. The national recovery team with support from non-government organisations such as the Foundation for National Parks & Wildlife has implemented various programs ranging from land acquisition to captive breeding and awareness raising projects. Monitoring programs are implemented to register any changes in population sizes. Surveys and analysis establish the genetic diversity of populations. Red fox and goat eradication aid the survival of local populations, and captive breeding programs are used as an 'insurance policy' to build up rock-wallaby numbers to boost wild populations. In the case of the yellow-footed rock-wallaby, these strategies have prevented the extinction of the species in New South Wales.

The inlet to the bulb is connected to a ground glass joint, while the outlet is vented to the air. Gas bubblers are used to exclude air from a reaction or a system. In the former case, the gas bubbler is fitted on the condenser of the reaction set-up. In the latter case, an oil bubbler is usually installed at the end of the inert gas manifold on a Schlenk line to prevent contamination by atmospheric oxygen and water. A gas bubbler acts as a one-way valve -- gases (hot air, evolved gases, solvent vapors) from the inlet will bubble through the fluid before being vented to the atmosphere. If there were an underpressure in the reaction vessel (such as when heat is removed, and the gases within contract), some fluid is sucked into a sump to equalize the pressure, instead of air. Wherever possible, such \\"suck back\\" should be avoided by filling the reaction apparatus with inert gas because an excessively low pressure will cause oil to be sucked into the reaction vessel, contaminating it. The bubbles allow the worker to visibly confirm that the system is being flushed with inert gas; the rate at which bubbles form allow the worker to adjust the inlet pressure. Oil bubblers Oil bubblers are filled with mineral or silicone oil. These are both quite resistant to chemical attack. Oil bubblers are predominantly used; the oil is inexpensive and not toxic. A drawback is that due to oil's lower density, in event of underpressure in the reaction vessel, enough oil may be sucked through the sump into the inert gas system to contaminate it. Due to the same reason, the pressure within the inert gas system will always remain close to atmospheric. This is a disadvantage when attempting cannula transfers using inert gas pressure to force a liquid reagent into another using a cannula. Mercury bubbler Cannula transfer using gas pressure Mercury bubblers are largely similar in construction to oil bubblers. They usually have a longer body to prevent mercury from splashing out through the bubbler outlet, and the inlet connection usually has a sintered glass disc to prevent mercury from being sucked back into the inert gas system when refilling an evacuated vessel. The most important advantage of mercury over oil, is that a fair amount of pressure can be maintained within the inert gas system (equivalent to the height of the mercury column). Tall columns may be used to exploit this further. By increasing the pressure within the inert gas system, boiling points are increased, allowing reactions under reflux to be carried out at a higher temperature. Also, cannula transfers are accomplished more easily due to the greater gas pressure available to push a liquid reagent from a vessel, through a cannula, into another vessel. Mercury bubblers are avoided where possible, due to the difficulty and expense in dealing with mercury spills. In addition, mercury can react with various chemicals, such as ammonia and acetylenes, with potentially hazardous results. In the context of cannula transfer, mercury bubblers may be avoided by pulling (instead of pushing) liquids through the cannula by vacuum. Alternatively, the oil bubbler may be closed off from the inert gas line with a stopcock, allowing inert gas to push the reagent through the cannula. Excess pressure is bled off from a bubbler fitted directly over the receiving vessel.

Its home is the Orpheum Theater. History The Sioux City Symphony Orchestra and The Sioux City Municipal Band were each formed in the early 1930s under the guidance and direction of Leo Kucinski. Under Kucinski's leadership, the orchestra gradually developed into a highly respected, paid- professional Class B civic orchestra with a regular performing season. The orchestra originally performed in the Sioux City Municipal Auditorium, but in 2001 moved to the restored historic Orpheum Theater. The Municipal Band, with close kinship to the orchestra, is also a paid-professional group that traces its origins to The Monahan Post 64 Band of the American Legion, in the 1920s. The Monahan Post Band became world-famous when it was selected as the \\"official\\" band of the American Legion in the mid-1920s. From its founding until the early 1930s, The Monahan Post Band made several tours that included concert appearances in New York City, New Orleans and Paris. The home of the Municipal Band is the city band shell in Grandview Park. Sioux City's ability to produce highly gifted musicians for fine music of all styles can be attributed to its citizens' very strong and longstanding commitment to and financial investment in music education within the public and private school systems. In the 1930s, Kucinski worked closely with Superintendent of Schools M.G. Clark to create the foundation for its public school music program. Additionally, Morningside College has long been home to a vital and energetic music department, which has served to contribute to the pool of fine musicians and music educators in Sioux City. Sioux City has an All-City Orchestra whose members are elementary grade students who participate by audition, and the Siouxland Youth Symphony, whose players are selected by competitive auditions from the junior schools and high schools in the area. After Kucinski, other music directors of the orchestra have included Thomas Lewis, Stephen Rogers Radcliffe and Xian Zhang. Xian Zhang had originally been contracted to the orchestra for 3 years, but resigned after 2 years because of her schedule demands. In March 2009, the orchestra announced the appointment of Ryan Haskins as its next music director, as of 1 July 2009.

It was founded by Clark Matis, Randy Merrell, and John Schweizer in 1981 as a maker of high-performance hiking boots. Since 1997, the company has been a wholly owned subsidiary of shoe industry giant Wolverine World Wide. The company recorded total sales of footwear and clothing of nearly $500 million in 2010. Products currently commercialised by Merrell include both, footwear and clothing products. Some of them are hiking boots, athletic shoes, sandals, jackets, knit caps, gloves, t-shirts, hoodies, shorts, and socks. Other accesores include backpacks, stuff sacks and bags. History =Origins= Merrell was established in 1981 when two executives for the Rossignol ski company, Clark Matis and John Schweizer, decided to launch a new maker of hiking boots,\\"Upward Bound,\\" Footwear News, vol. 67, no. 2 (January 17, 2011), pg. 18. The pair decided to join forces with Randal Ivan Merrell (R.I. Merrell), a maker of highly-praised custom boots which retailed for $500 a pair.Wayne Niemi, \\"Upward Bound,\\" Footwear News, vol. 67, no. 2 (January 17, 2011), pg. 18. Matis set to work designing a more affordable high-performance boot, which was developed in 1982. Plans were made for production of the new line in factories located in Italy, a leading exporter of footwear to the world market at the time. In 1983, the new Merrell company delivered its first product to the market, making shipments to a pair of east coast retailers specializing in hiking gear. In 1986, Randy Merrell sought to return to his previous life as a maker of custom boots and sold his share of the company bearing his name. That same year the company sold its 25,000th pair of boots. =Sale to Karhu= In 1987, Merrell was purchased by Karhu. The new owners moved production of Merrell products to Asia, reducing retail prices and expanding sales. In 1988, sales of Merrell products topped the $4 million mark. A period of rapid growth for Merrell followed with 1989 sales increasing by 50%, to the $6 million mark. By 1990, some 300,000 pairs of shoes and boots were being sold annually, with sales for the year topping the $10 million mark for the first time. The company became a global enterprise, with divisions established in Canada, the United Kingdom, Scandinavia and the United States. The year 1992 saw another doubling of the company's sales volume, topping the $20 million mark. By the middle of the decade, Merrell products were being sold in 22 countries. =Sale to Wolverine World Wide= Merrell All Out Crush Light trail running shoes A Merrell shoe print In 1997, Karhu sold Merrell to Wolverine World Wide, a large footwear corporation which manufactures Hush Puppies shoes and Wolverine brand boots. In the year of the Wolverine acquisition, Merrell sales volume totaled $23 million.Wayne Niemi, \\"Making Merrell,\\" Footwear News, vol. 67, no. 2 (January 17, 2011), pg. 13.

This initial foray into lightweight footwear was not a commercial success, but a team led by Clark Matis came up with the idea of using a very aggressive trail running outsole with a casual slip-on upper made of pigskin suede, a material previously perfected and used extensively in the Hush Puppies line. The work of Matis' design group culminated with the introduction of what would become the brand's signature shoe, the \\"Jungle Moc.\\" The new product was a smash success, with total shipments of Jungle Mocs hitting 3.5 million pairs by 2002. The 10 millionth pair of Jungle Mocs was shipped in 2009, with the style continuing in production to the present date. In 2007, the Merrell line was expanded yet again to include apparel and accessories. By 2010, Merrell products were being sold in 151 countries. Annual sales for the brand totaled nearly $500 million in 2010.

The game is based on the 1975 film Monty Python and the Holy Grail and was the second of three Monty Python games created by 7th Level. The game's aesthetics are a mixture of photo realistic rendering and the comic style of Terry Gilliam. The objective is to move through the world and collect a series of objects in order to cross the bridge of death. The game also contains a series of sketches and audio clips not present in the film, including an alternative reason for the minstrels' disappearance. Gameplay Many mini-games are available to play along the way, including a Tetris clone using dead plague victims, a Whac-A-Mole game where a knight has to spank virgins in a bed (points are deducted for spanking the bare-cheeked women) and a Simon says game where the player has to remember the order in which four different coloured burning witches scream. The majority of the game is a point and click interface, where the player must also collect items to complete puzzles, and complete the missing planks on the bridge of death. Reception Global sales of Holy Grail, Complete Waste of Time and Desktop Pythonizer surpassed 650,000 copies by November 1997, which accounted for revenues above $15 million at 7th Level. A Next Generation critic said Monty Python & the Quest for the Holy Grail \\"lacks any semblance of decent gameplay\\". He elaborated that since there is no indicator of where the hot spots are, the gameplay consists of little more than blindly clicking everywhere on the screen to see what happens. Despite this, he said that enthusiasts of the film would probably still enjoy the game due to the previously unseen video clips included on it. MacUser named Quest for the Holy Grail one of 1996's top 50 CD-ROMs, while Inside Mac Games declared it the year's best comedy game. The latter publication's editors wrote, \\"Non-Python fans will probably wonder what the big deal is, but even casual followers will be rolling on the floor.\\" The game was a finalist for Computer Gaming Worlds 1996 \\"Classic/Puzzle Game of the Year\\" award, which ultimately went to Baku Baku Animal. However, it won the category's Reader's Choice award that year.

Origins and duties The word \\"zaptié\\" is derived from the Turkish zaptiye; a term which was used to refer to both the Ottoman Empire's gendarmerie prior to 1923, and to the Turkish personnel recruited for the Cyprus Military Police during the period of British rule on the island. The Turkish word \\"zaptiye\\" is derived from the Arabic word \\"ضابط\\" \\"dhaabet\\" which means officer. The Italian colonial governments in the territories listed above modelled the various zaptié constabulary forces on Italy's own carabinieri. The first of these units was raised in Eritrea in 1882, drawing from existing companies of basci bazuks (irregular troops).Piero Crociani, page 21, \\"Le Uniformi dell' A.O.I. (Somalia 1889-1941)\\", La Roccia Edizioni 1980 In Tripolitania and Cyrenaica the Italian officered zaptié were generally used for patrolling rural areas in coastal regions, while mounted police or spahis operated in the southern desert regions, together with camel mounted meharists. In the city of Tripoli civilian police were employed. The original Libyan zaptié were recruited from indigenous gendarmerie of the same name, who had served under the Turkish government prior to 1910.Piero Crociani, pages 27-28, \\"Le Uniformi Coloniali Libiche 1912-1942\\", La Roccia Edizioni 1980 In Italian Somaliland, the zaptié provided a ceremonial escort for the Italian Viceroy (Governor) as well as the territorial police. There were nearly one thousand such para-military police in 1922, when Benito Mussolini took control of the Italian government and started a policy of \\"pacification\\" and assimilation of the Italian colonies.Piero Crociani, pages 21-22, \\"Le Uniformi dell' A.O.I. (Somalia 1889-1941)\\", La Roccia Edizioni 1980 Attire, weaponry and ranks Zaptié troopers were armed with Model 1874 revolvers, cavalry carbines, and 1871 model sabres. Officers and some non-commissioned officers were Italian, but the rank and file were recruited from the colony in question. As an example, the Somali Zaptié Corps in 1927 numbered 1,500 Somali and 72 Italian personnel. Uniforms varied from colony to colony, but usually comprised fezes, red sashes and khaki or white clothing. A common feature was the white and red collar insignia of the carabinieri. Campaigns Cavalry and fort of the Sultanate of Hobyo, one of the ruling Somali polities that the zaptié fought against in the Campaign of the Sultanates. Three hundred zaptié took part in the Italian conquest of northern Somalia in 1925. As part of the \\"colonna Musso\\", they assisted in the occupation of the Sultanate of Hobyo (Hafun and Ordio). Other zaptìé units served with the \\"colonna Bergesio\\" in the Elemari region (Gallacaio, Garad and Sinedogò). In 1926, zaptìé served in the Majeerteen Sultanate (Bender Ziada, Candala and Bender Cassim).Italian conquest of north-eastern Somalia Zaptìé detachments participated in the Italian conquest of Ethiopia in 1936 and in the East African Campaign of World War II. In 1941 in Somalia and Ethiopia 2,186 zaptìé (plus 500 recruits under training) formed part of the Carabinieri. They were organised in a battalion commanded by Major Alfredo Serranti that fought at the Battle of Culqualber in Ethiopia for three months until this military unit was destroyed by the Allies.

The company performs three or more operas in a season. Opera seasons start in October and end in the early summer of the following year. It performs mostly in the Blaisdell Concert Hall, Honolulu. HOT performs most of its mainstage productions at the Blaisdell Concert Hall and has also staged works at the historic Hawaii Theatre, warehouses, the Chinatown Artist Lofts, and other funky venues. Since 2004 HOT has added a summer production of a comic opera by Gilbert and Sullivan or a musical, and in 2016 will stage a concert production of Verdi's Rigoletto starring Hawaii's own baritone, Quinn Kelsey. Kelsey began his career as a chorus member in HOT's acclaimed volunteer chorus, and has gone on to shine on stages across the world.  History  The first opera ever presented by the organization was Puccini's Madama Butterfly, which was performed in McKinley High School auditorium in Honolulu in 1961. For the next two decades the company was part of the Honolulu Symphony. In 1980 it became an independent tax-exempt corporation. The first independent season was in 1981 and consisted of three productions: La Bohème, Lucia di Lammermoor, and Carmen. Supertitles were introduced in 1987 and 1989 was the first year in which all available seats were sold before opening night. By 1993 HOT membership had exceeded 2,000 individuals. The company is currently led by Interim General Director Karen Tiller.Program for Le nozze di Figaro, January 2010. The year 2002 saw HOT's \\"Bad Girl Season\\" with productions of La traviata, Salome, and Carmen. Sets and costumes for Salome were designed by artist Thomas Woodruff.Thomas Woodruff web site . The 2007 production of Madama Butterfly, a co-production with Opera Omaha, featured set and costume designs by the visual artist Jun Kaneko. The Summer Season was launched in 2004 with Gilbert and Sullivan's The Mikado, followed by The Pirates of Penzance (2005), The King and I with Richard Chamberlain (2006), South Pacific (2007), and A Little Night Music (2008). The summer production for 2009 was cancelled for budgetary reasons. Charity Navigator has awarded the company its top \\"4-star\\" rating for responsible fiscal management since 2007. In 2014, HOT staged a modern production of Gilbert and Sullivan's The Mikado in Honolulu and on Maui. Akina led his artistic team in creating a presentation that included anime, harajuku girls, and yakuza-inspired characters. In 2015, HOT launched its Opera in a Warehouse initiative. A part of its #ImHOT campaign to take opera into the community and develop a new generation of opera goers, the company staged Jonathan Dove's chamber opera, Siren Song, a story of a young sailor involved in a catfish scandal. The company took over an empty warehouse in the arts district of Kaka'ako and turned it into a production venue. Siren Song, directed by Akina, received rave reviews and combined a modern, relevant story with the designs by video designer Adam Turner dancing on the white warehouse walls to create a once-in- a-lifetime experience. In 2016, HOT added two special one-night only concerts to its calendar including Rigoletto in Concert starring Hawaii's Quinn Kelsey and the Hawaii debut of the internationally acclaimed trio Sol3 Mio. A family of classically trained singers from New Zealand, Sol3 Mio presents a blend of opera and pop that have thrilled audiences around the world.  Educational programs  A classroom-based education program was begun in 1981 and was expanded to more elementary and high school grade levels in 1984. A program called \\"Opera Highlights\\" became part of the curriculum of the University of Hawaii's College of Continuing Education in 1983. HOT now has several educational programs, most notably its \\"Opera For Everyone\\" (OFE) program. OFE allows students to participate in all aspects of an opera production from technical crew to performing to simply watching an opera. The final dress rehearsal is opened up to students for a reduced price, usually on a Wednesday night. Other aspects of the show are assisted by OFE participants who can help in such aspects as set building, costuming and makeup, or performance. This is a rare opportunity offered to students who may pursue careers in opera in the future, and is one of the programs that makes HOT unique.HOT website HOT's Education Team serves over 25,000 keiki and adult learners each year through its innovative programming. The OFE program stages over 75 performances at schools on multiple islands throughout the State of Hawaii.

Frisking (also called a patdown or pat down) is a search of a person's outer clothing wherein a person runs his or her hands along the outer garments to detect any concealed weapons. U.S. Law In the United States, a law enforcement officer may briefly detain a person upon reasonable suspicion of involvement in a crime but short of probable cause to arrest; such a detention is known as a Terry stop. Writing for the Court in Berkemer v. McCarty, Justice Marshall stated :the usual traffic stop is more analogous to a so-called \\"Terry stop,\\" see Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968) (468 U.S. at 439) When a search for weapons is also authorized, the procedure is known as a stop and frisk. To justify the stop, a law enforcement officer must be able to point to \\"specific and articulable facts\\" that would indicate to a reasonable person that a crime has been, is being, or is about to be committed. In Terry v. Ohio, Chief Justice Warren stated :And in justifying the particular intrusion the police officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion. (392 U.S. at 21) If the officer reasonably suspects that the suspect is in possession of a weapon that is of danger to the officer or others, the officer may conduct a frisking of the suspect's outer garments to search for weapons. The search must be limited to what is necessary to discover weapons; In Terry v. Ohio, Chief Justice Warren stated :Thus it must be limited to that which is necessary for the discovery of weapons which might be used to harm the officer or others nearby, and may realistically be characterized as something less than a \\"full\\" search, even though it remains a serious intrusion. (392 U.S. at 26) Chief Justice Warren continued: :The sole justification of the search in the present situation is the protection of the police officer and others nearby, and it must therefore be confined in scope to an intrusion reasonably designed to discover guns, knives, clubs, or other hidden instruments for the assault of the police officer. (392 U.S. at 29) however, pursuant to the \\"plain feel\\" doctrine, police may seize contraband discovered in the course of a frisk, but only if the contraband's identity is immediately apparent. Writing for the Court in Minnesota v. Dickerson, Justice White stated :If a police officer lawfully pats down a suspect's outer clothing and feels an object whose contour or mass makes its identity immediately apparent, there has been no invasion of the suspect's privacy beyond that already authorized by the officer's search for weapons; if the object is contraband, its warrantless seizure would be justified by the same practical considerations that inhere in the plain-view context. (508 U.S. at 375–376) Justice White continued: :Here, the officer's continued exploration of respondent's pocket after having concluded that it contained no weapon was unrelated to \\"[t]he sole justification of the search [under Terry:] the protection of the police officer and others nearby.\\" 392 U.S., at 29. It therefore amounted to the sort of evidentiary search that Terry expressly refused to authorize, see id., at 26, and that we have condemned in subsequent cases. (508 U.S. at 378) =New York City program= The New York City Police Department has come under scrutiny for its use of the Terry stop. Supporters say that it reduces crime, but civil rights advocates say it is racial profiling. John A. Eterno, a former city police captain describes: \\"My take is that this has become more like a 'throw a wide net and see what you can find' kind of thing. I don't see it as targeted enforcement, especially when you see numbers that we are talking about.\\" Looking at \\"eight odd blocks of Brownsville, Brooklyn, a study found that between January 2006 and March 2010, the police made nearly 52,000 stops.\\"Rivera, Ray, Al Baker and Janet Roberts, “A Few Blocks, 4 Years, 52,000 Police Stops”, The New York Times, July 11, 2010.

The town of Corydon is also known as Indiana's First State Capital and as Historic Corydon. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, but the listing was amended in 1988 to expand the district's geographical boundaries and include additional sites. The district includes numerous historical structures, most notably the Old Capitol (Indiana's first state capitol building), the Old Treasury Building (Indiana's first state office building), Governor Hendricks' Headquarters, the Constitution Elm Memorial, the Posey House, the Kintner- McGrain House (Cedar Glade), and The Kintner House Inn, as well as other residential and commercial sites. History Corydon, Indiana, which was platted in 1808, continues to serve as the county seat of government for Harrison County, Indiana. The town served as the second capital of the Indiana Territory from 1813 to 1816, but it is best known for its service as the first capital of Indiana from 1816 to 1825. Some of the most significant structures within the historic district date from this early period of the town's history, including the Old Capitol, the centerpiece of the district. Corydon became the seat of government for the Indiana Territory when the territorial capital was moved from Vincennes, in Knox County, shortly after the outbreak of the War of 1812.Officials of the territorial government feared an attack on the capitol and drafted a resolution to move the territorial government further east, away from the frontier. In addition, opponents of William Henry Harrison, the first governor of the Indiana Territory, wanted to move the capital away from his political stronghold in Knox County. Supporters of the move also argued that relocation of the territorial capital to the east would provide a more centralized location for its citizens, especially after its western portion was reorganized to form the Illinois Territory in 1809. See See also Dennis Pennington, a Harrison County representative and the speaker of the territorial legislature's lower house, helped secure Corydon's selection as the capital by pointing out that the Harrison County Courthouse, which the county government planned to build on Corydon's public square, could be used as an assembly building for the territorial legislature. Pennington was awarded the contract to supervise construction of the courthouse, which became known as the Old Capitol. See See also In addition to its role as the capitol of the Indiana Territory, Corydon served as the site of a constitutional convention to consider statehood for Indiana in 1816. Forty- three delegates convened from June 10 to June 29, 1816, to draft Indiana's first state constitution.\\"The Setting for the Convention,\\" in Sources disagree on the exact location of the gathering. Because the courthouse was not completed at that time, the delegates met at \\"the courthouse on the hill,\\" which may have referred to a nearby log home that the territorial government had rented. Cramped conditions and the summer heat caused the men to gather under a giant elm tree, which was later named the Constitution Elm. The town's historic district includes a portion of the tree's preserved trunk, surrounded by a sandstone memorial. The Indiana General Assembly met for the first time at Corydon under the new constitution and state government on November 4, 1816, and Indiana was admitted as the nineteenth state in the Union on December 11, 1816.Barnhart and Riker, pp. 461–63.\\"The Final Steps to Statehood,\\" Bennett, The Indiana Historian, pp. 10–11. Corydon served as the first state capital of Indiana from 1816 to 1825, when the seat of state government was moved to Indianapolis.Taylor, et. al, p. 169. When the historic district was first added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, the area encompassed eight sites that existed when Corydon became the capital of Indiana in 1816. These include the Old Capitol building (Harrison County Courthouse), along with the public square surrounding it, Indiana's first state office building (also known as the Old Treasury Building), Governor William Hendricks' Headquarters, the Constitution Elm, the Posey House, the Westfall House, the Branham home/tavern, and the Kintner-McGrain House (named Cedar Glade). Includes See also, site map and accompanying photographs. In 1989 the district was extended to Indian Creek in the north and west, east to College Avenue, and south to Little Indian Creek to include additional historic structures. The district's period of significance spans from 1808 to 1929. Includes See also, site map and accompanying photographs. The district's boundary increase encompassed the eight structures from its early era as a territorial and state capital, as well as commercial and residential buildings constructed after 1825, including a new, three-story county Harrison County Courthouse that was completed in 1929. A historical marker erected on the Harrison County Courthouse lawn denotes the town's surrender to Confederate Brigadier General John Hunt Morgan's raiders following the Battle of Corydon on July 9, 1863.Taylor, et. al., p. 171. The battle site, which is located outside of town, is listed separately on the National Register. The district's courthouse square also includes a memorial to the late Indiana governor Frank O'Bannon; his father, Robert P. O'cannon; and grandfather, Lew O'cannon, all of whom were prominent in Corydon. Plans for the O'Bannon memorial on the southwest corner of the courthouse square were announced on May 22, 2007. It includes a lifesize bronze statue of Frank O'Bannon sitting on a limestone bench and three pillars honoring the O'Bannons. The memorial, which cost $200,000, was dedicated in June 2008. Because of its history as a territorial and state capital, Corydon sees an estimated 30,000 visitors each year.AmericanProfile.com . Notable sites =Old Capitol= Old Capitol Building in downtown Corydon. The Old Capitol building, a part of the Corydon Capital State Historic Site, is administered by the Indiana State Museum and Historic Sites. The two-story, Federal-style, limestone building served as Indiana's first state capitol from 1816 until 1825. The building was originally intended to serve as the Harrison County Courthouse. Construction began in 1814, when Corydon was the capital of the Indiana Territory. The building was nearly completed in 1816, the year that Indiana was granted statehood and its first state legislature convened at Corydon.Taylor, et. al., p. 169, and Boomhower, p. 17. The building was primarily used as an assembly building for the territorial and state legislatures, but the county government and district courts occasionally used it when the Indiana General Assembly was not in session. Dennis Pennington, who became the state's first speaker of the Indiana Senate after statehood in 1816, supervised its construction. The two- story building is square with walls thick. The exposed exterior of the building is not dressed, using only stones that were cut roughly square. The foundation, dug into the ground, is also thick. The lower level has ceilings, flagstone floors, and a barn rail made from hewn timber. The upper floor's ceiling is tall. The original building had a scale and balance on the roof as the symbol of justice, but they were removed in 1833 and replaced with a large bell. The construction cost of original building was approximately $3,000. Two large chimneys that accommodated the four fireplaces installed in both the upper and lower levels were closed up during later renovations. A wood floor covered the original flagstone floor.Taylor, et. al., p. 170. When Corydon became the state capital of Indiana in 1816, the Old Capitol building served as the seat of state government. The Indiana Supreme Court and the Indiana Senate were located on the upper level; the Indiana House of Representatives met on the first floor. After 1825, when the state capital was moved to Indianapolis, the Old Captol building continued to be used as the Harrison County Courthouse and county government office building until 1929, when a new county courthouse was completed. In 1917, the State of Indiana purchased the Old Capitol building with the intention of preserving it. The restored building opened in 1929 and has since been preserved and protected as a memorial. The Old Capitol, sometimes referred to as the Corydon Capitol, was included within the original boundaries of the Corydon Historic District when it was listed on the National Register in 1973. The building has been restored as closely as possible to its original appearance, including furniture and paint colors.Works Project Administration, Federal Writers Project, p. 183. In 2015, a major restoration project was completed on the town square to protect the Old Capitol building from water damage, to update the electrical system and landscaping, and to install new walkways. =First state office building= The first state office building, which dates from 1817, is also known as the Old Treasury Building. It housed state government offices, including the first state auditor's and treasurer's offices. See also: Conn, p. 205. The building was included in the initial historic district designation. It is located on Walnut Street, east of the Governor's Hendricks' Headquarters. The Indiana State Museum and Historic Sites Corporation began a major rehabilitation of this building in 2008. =Governor Hendricks's Headquarters= Governor's Headquarters, built in 1817, was home of Davis Floyd and later of William Hendricks. Governor Hendricks's Headquarters is also part of the Corydon Capitol State Historic Site. Davis Floyd, a former treasurer and auditor of the Indiana Territory and a delegate to the constitutional convention in 1816, built the residence in 1817, when he was an Indiana state legislator. After Floyd lost the home during the financial Panic of 1819, the state government purchased it to house the Indiana's governor. It opened as a state historic site in 1979. William Hendricks occupied the building from 1822 to 1825, when he was governor of Indiana. Hendricks was Indiana's first state representative to U.S. House of Representatives in 1816 and later served in the U.S. Senate. William A. Porter, a lawyer, judge, and politician, purchased the building in 1841. Judge Porter served in the Indiana legislature was speaker of Indiana House in 1847–48. =Constitution Elm Memorial= The Constitution Elm commemorates the first state constitutional convention that was held from June 10 to June 29, 1816, when forty-three delegates convened at Corydon to discuss statehood for the territory and draft a state constitution for Indiana. The cramped conditions of the log cabin in which the constitution convention was held, along with the summer heat, caused the delegates to gather outdoors under the branches of a nearby elm tree, which was later memorialized as the Constitution Elm. It has been estimated that the giant elm was tall with a trunk that measured across and branches that spread more than . Dutch elm disease destroyed the tree in 1925; however, the trunk has been preserved. It is protected by a sandstone memorial. =Posey House= The Posey home was included in the district's original National Register designation in 1973. Allan D. Thom and Thomas Lloyd Posey were the original owners of the home when its construction began in 1817. Colonel Posey was the son of Thomas Posey, governor of the Indiana Territory from 1813 to 1816. Colonel Posey, who was active in Harrison County's civic affairs, served as the county treasurer (1818–24) and was appointed adjutant general of Indiana in 1823. He used one room as his office and operated a dry- goods and cabinet shop in another portion of the house. Colonel Posey never married, but he raised fourteen orphans in the home.Griffin, The Story of Indiana's Constitution Elm, Corydon, Indiana, June 1816, pp. 19–21.Gugin and St. Clair, pp. 32–39. The majority of the two-story brick home was built between 1817 and 1818. It was constructed in three stages: the main house; a wing used as offices, a store, and a cabinet shop; and a two-story ell at the rear of the home that housed a dining room, kitchen, pantry, smokehouse, and woodshed. Servant quarters were located on the ell's second floor. The rear of the property included woods and a spring, as well as several outbuildings. A portion of the home was later demolished. The property passed through several owners until the Daughters of the American Revolution acquired it in 1925 and operated it as a local history museum through 1999. The Posey home was acquired by the State of Indiana in 2000, but it remained vacant until it was donated to the Historical Society of Harrison County in 2012. =Westfall House= The Westfall House, a log cabin located near the Constitution Elm, is the oldest extant building in Corydon. The home is privately owned and not open to the public. =Branham home/tavern= William Branham began operating a tavern on the site in 1809 in a structure originally built in 1800.Conn, p. 205. =Kintner-McGrain House= Originally known as Cedar Glade, the Kintner- McGrain House was the home of Jacob Kintner, who built the Greek Revival-style residence in 1808 near Indian Creek. Kintner's heirs sold the property in 1849 to Thomas McGrain Sr. =Kintner House Hotel= The Kintner House Hotel, completed in 1873, originally had twenty-six rooms for guests on its upper floor. It was converted to apartments in the early twentieth century and was used for other commercial purposes until it was renovated into a bed and breakfast inn in 1986–87. The property, which is located within the district, was listed separately on the National Register in 1987. =Harrison County Courthouse= The three-story county Harrison County Courthouse, which is located next to the Old Capitol, was completed in 1929. =Grand Masonic Lodge= Grand Masonic Lodge The Grand Masonic Lodge first organized in 1817 under the Grand Lodge of Kentucky; the Grand Lodge of Indiana organized in Madison in 1818. It is the oldest Masonic Lodge building in Indiana. Its founding members included State Senator Dennis Pennington; Indiana first governor Jonathan Jennings; State Representative Davis Floyd, and U.S. Congressman William Hendricks, among others. The present-day lodge building on Elm Street was erected in 1926. It is still used by Masons and the Order of the Eastern Star. =Leora Brown School= Leora Brown School Construction on the school, which was originally known as the Corydon Colored School, began in 1891. It served as a primary and secondary school for the community's black students. The first graduation of high school students from the school occurred on May 14, 1897. In 1949, the Indiana General Assembly passed an act to desegregate Indiana's public schools by 1954. The Corydon Colored School closed in 1950, when the Corydon public schools were racially integrated, beginning in the 1950–51 school year. In 1987, the school was renamed for Leora Brown Farrow, the school's longest serving-teacher, who taught at school from 1924 until 1950. The school is located at the corner of Summit and Hill Streets, a block east of the district's amended boundary line that was established as part of the National Register listing in 1989. Although the school was added to Indiana's Register of Historic Places in 1992 and is recognized with a state historical marker, it is not listed as a separate property in the National Register as of 2016.

The station is owned by Monte Spearman and Gentry Todd Spearman, through licensee High Plains Radio Network, LLC. Historical role In November 1941, Helena's first radio station KFFA went on the air. Station Manager and part owner Sam Anderson offered to sell a block of time to a group of blues musicians on the condition that they obtain a sponsor. Max Moore, owner of Interstate Grocer Company, which distributed King Biscuit Flour, agreed to sponsor the show — thus was born King Biscuit Entertainers and the beginning of King Biscuit Time. The program was first broadcast on November 21, 1941, and featured blues artists Sonny Boy Williamson and Robert Lockwood, Jr. playing live in the studio. Other musicians who played on the show included pianist Pinetop Perkins and guitarist Robert Nighthawk. Musicians such as guitarist Hound Dog Taylor would stop by for occasional appearances. These KFFA broadcasts, heard in the hometowns of Nighthawk, Lockwood, and Sonny Boy, were a draw to young southern blues artists who came to Helena to hang around and learn. Jimmy Rogers and Little Walter, later central to the sound of the Muddy Waters band, were among them. Levon Helm, drummer and vocalist for Ronnie Hawkins and The Band, grew up outside Helena in Turkey Scratch. He frequently went into town to watch as the show was broadcast. The KFFA studios were on the second floor of the Floyd Truck Lines building, a rickety old structure. The program was broadcast from there for 20 years until the building was condemned and the studio moved to modern quarters on the top floor of the Helena National Bank Building. The show opens with the announcer's, \\"Sunshine\\" Sonny Payne's, words, (dinner bell clang) \\"Pass the biscuits, 'cause it's King Biscuit Time!\\" With more than 17,000 broadcasts, this show has influenced several generations of blues, rock, and pop musicians. Terry Mross, American actor best known for his role in Dazed and Confused, worked at KFFA in the early 1970s and was a frequent guest host of King Biscuit Time when substituting for permanent host \\"Sunshine\\" Sonny Payne. The program is broadcast weekdays at 12:15 PM local time and recordings of the show are available for download from the internet at the station's web site.

Sergei Petrovich Melgunov () (December 24 or 25, 1879 - May 26, 1956) was a Russian historian, publicist and politician best known for his opposition to the Soviet government and his numerous works on the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the Russian Civil War. Melgunov was born in Moscow to an old aristocratic family. His mother was Polish, née Gruszecka. Having graduated from Moscow University in 1904, he began his political and scholarly career in Imperial Russia. He became a member of the Russian Constitutional Democratic party (“Cadets”) in 1906 and joined the People’s Socialist Party in 1907. In 1911, Melgunov established a publishing house Zadruga (\\"Задруга\\") where he published over 500 books and a journal Golos minuvshego (\\"The Voice of the Past\\"). After the 1917 Bolshevik October Revolution, he became an active opponent of Lenin’s government and joined the anti-Soviet Union of Revival of Russia, which advocated an armed overthrow of the Bolshevik regime. He was arrested and sentenced to death in 1919, then reprieved, with the sentence commuted to imprisonment. He was released in 1921 and forced into exile in 1922. Melgunov finally settled in Paris, where he continued his historical research and edited several émigré journals. His most famous book is Red Terror in Russia () published in 1924. Historian Robert Gellately describes Melgunov's pioneering study of the Red Terror as \\"a detailed and shocking account\\" which \\"has been confirmed by recent revelations from the Russian archives and by historians.\\"Robert Gellately. Lenin, Stalin, and Hitler: The Age of Social Catastrophe Knopf, 2007 p. 72.. Conversely, French historian Jean-Jacques Marie, Russophone and veteran specialist in the history of the Soviet Union, has more recently credited Melgonov with the wholesale invention of at least one \\"legend\\" about the Red Army: \\"The Crimea is the location of the last military confrontation between Red and White forces. The battle there fought bred contradictory narratives and legends, like the many-times repeated one (since its invention in 1923 by a certain Melgunov) according to which, after Wrangel's defeat, Trotsky executed, not only 500 dockers (!), but also 50,000 soldiers and officers of this army ; yet the vast majority of this army had succeeded in leaving by boat!\\". Indeed, according to Wrangel's officers' own published accounts, \\"Wrangel's general staff succeeded in evacuating about 145,000 men out of an army of a little more than 150,000. The 50,000 officers of Wrangel's army that several \\"historians\\" have Trotsky and Bela Kun execute issue thus from an imagination that, while fertile, proves incompatible with arithmatics\\".

The degree to which sound is transferred between two materials depends on how well their acoustical impedances match. In musical instrument design Musical instruments are generally designed to radiate sound effectively. A high-impedance part of the instrument, such as a string, transmits vibrations through a bridge (intermediate impedance) to a sound board (lower impedance). The soundboard then moves the still lower-impedance air. Without bridge and soundboard, the instrument does not transmit enough sound to the air, and is too quiet to be performed with. An electric guitar has no soundboard; it uses a microphone pick-up and artificial amplification. Without amplification, electric guitars are very quiet. Stethoscope Stethoscopes roughly match the acoustical impedance of the human body, so they transmit sounds from a patient's chest to the doctor's ear much more effectively than the air does. Putting an ear to someone's chest would have a similar effect. Building Acoustics In building Acoustic transmission in building design refers to a number of processes by which sound can be transferred from one part of a building to another. Typically these are: #Airborne transmission - a noise source in one room sends air pressure waves which induce vibration to one side of a wall or element of structure setting it moving such that the other face of the wall vibrates in an adjacent room. Structural isolation therefore becomes an important consideration in the acoustic design of buildings. Highly sensitive areas of buildings, for example recording studios, may be almost entirely isolated from the rest of a structure by constructing the studios as effective boxes supported by springs. Air tightness also becomes an important control technique. A tightly sealed door might have reasonable sound reduction properties, but if it is left open only a few millimeters its effectiveness is reduced to practically nothing. The most important acoustic control method is adding mass into the structure, such as a heavy dividing wall, which will usually reduce airborne sound transmission better than a light one. #Impact transmission - a noise source in one room results from an impact of an object onto a separating surface, such as a floor and transmits the sound to an adjacent room. A typical example would be the sound of footsteps in a room being heard in a room below. Acoustic control measures usually include attempts to isolate the source of the impact, or cushioning it. For example, carpets will perform significantly better than hard floors. #Flanking transmission - a more complex form of noise transmission, where the resultant vibrations from a noise source are transmitted to other rooms of the building usually by elements of structure within the building. For example, in a steel framed building, once the frame itself is set into motion the effective transmission can be pronounced. References * Carl Hopkins. Sound insulation. Elsevier.

South Korean Embassy in Beijing, China. China–South Korea relations refers to the diplomatic relations between the People's Republic of China (China) and the Republic of Korea (South Korea), which were formally established in the 1990s. Before then, the PRC recognized only the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) while South Korea in turn recognized only the Republic of China (Taiwan). In recent years, China and South Korea have endeavored to boost their strategic and cooperative partnership in numerous sectors, as well as promoting high level relationship.http://www.korea.net/news.do?mode=detail&guid;=47084 Trade, tourism and multiculturalism, specifically, have been the most important factors of strengthening two neighbouring countries cooperative partnership. The relations significantly deteriorated after South Korea announced its intentions to deploy THAAD, a move that China strongly opposed. China imposed an unofficial boycott on South Korea in an attempt to stop them from deploying the missile system. However, at the end of October 2017, the two countries ended the 1-year-long diplomatic dispute and have been working swiftly to get their relationship back on track since, strengthening exchanges and cooperation between each other, creating harmony of interests, and agreed to resume exchanges and cooperation in all areas. All economic and cultural bans from China towards South Korea were also lifted as a result, with political and security cooperation, businesses and cultural exchanges between the two countries getting back to healthy state. Upon resumption of relationship, China and South Korea have been organizing presidential and governmental visits, working together on the Korean Peninsula, assisting with the development of other countries, and cooperating in numerous areas. History of relations =Korean War= The newly established People's Republic of China participated in the Korean War between 1950 and 1953, sending the People's Volunteer Army to fight alongside Soviet Union against United States and United Nations troops in October 1950. It successfully drove the UN forces out of North Korea, but its own offensive into the South itself was repelled. The participation of the PVA strained relations between South Korea and China. The Korean War concluded in July 1953, resulting in the establishment of the Korean Demilitarized Zone, and the eventual withdrawal of Chinese forces from the Korean Peninsula. US troops though have remained in South Korea to this day. =Cold War= Throughout the Cold War, there were no official relations between the PRC and ROK. The PRC maintained close relations with North Korea, and South Korea maintained diplomatic relations with the Republic of China in Taiwan. This hindered trade between Seoul and Beijing, because South Korea was unable to protect its citizens and business interests in China without some form of international agreements. Beijing's economic needs involving South Korea were initially eclipsed by those of Moscow. Relations under Park and Chun (1961–1988) President Park Chung-hee initiated and President Chun Doo-hwan advanced a policy of establishing relations with China and the Soviet Union, and attempting to improve those with North Korea. China and the USSR had significant sway in determining the future of the Korean Peninsula. Good relations with old allies of North Korea were therefore integral to the Nordpolitik policy. Seoul's official contact with Beijing started by the landing of a hijacked CAAC Flight 296 in May 1983. China sent a delegation of thirty-three officials to Seoul to negotiate its return. This marked the beginning of a series of casual exchanges of citizens. For example, in March 1984, a South Korean tennis team visited Kunming for a Davis Cup match with a Chinese team. In April 1984, a thirty-four-member Chinese basketball team arrived in Seoul to participate in the Eighth Asian Junior Basketball Championships. Some Chinese officials reportedly paid quiet visits to South Korea to inspect its industries, while South Korean officials visited China to attend a range of international conferences. Late 1980s Active South Korean-Chinese individual contacts have been encouraged. Academics, journalists, and particularly families divided between South Korea and China were able to exchange visits freely in the late 1980s. Significant numbers of citizens of each country reside in the other. , more than 600,000 PRC citizens reside in South Korea, of whom 70% are ethnic Koreans from the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in China's Jilin Province and other parts of China, while roughly 560,000 South Korean citizens lived in China. However, during this period significant barriers to strong trade and relations persisted. The absence of any protections granted by official relations had still remained. Beijing has been politically closer to Pyongyang, and relations with North Korea remained tense and distrustful. After the Tiananmen Square protests Pyongyang publicly supported of Beijing's actions. Seoul, on the other hand, did not condone or condemn the actions in Tiananmen Square. Post Cold War and Reform and Opening Up Trade between the two countries continued to increase nonetheless, especially after the PRC's reform and opening up. Furthermore, China has attempted to mediate between North Korea and the US; between North Korea and Japan; and also initiated and promoted tripartite talks—between Pyongyang, Seoul, and Washington.Zhao, Quansheng. \\"China and the Korean Peace Process.\\" In the Korean Peace Processand the Four Powers. Burlington: Ashgate, 2003. South Korea had been an ally of the Republic of China. But in 1992 diplomatic ties between Seoul and Taipei were nevertheless severed. On August 24, 1992 formal diplomatic relations were established between Seoul and Beijing. By 2004 China had become South Korea's leading trading partner. After the KORUS FTA (United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement) was finalized on 30 June 2007, the Chinese government immediately began seeking an FTA agreement with South Korea.\\"ROK’s Yonhap: Exports have been Remarkable, but can S.

The Park-Xi summit in 2013 showed promise of warming relations, but this quickly chilled after China extended their Air Defense Identification Zone (East China Sea) over South Korean territory. Despite this, in July 2014, Xi visited South Korea before its traditional ally North Korea, and in their talks, both leaders affirmed their support for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula and the ongoing free trade agreement negotiations. Both leaders also expressed their concerns over Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe's reinterpretation of Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution. In October 2016, South Korea lodged a formal complaint with Beijing accusing Chinese fishing boats of ramming and sinking a South Korean coast guard vessel. The incident occurred on 7 October when South Korean coast guard officers were trying to stop about 40 Chinese fishing boats from suspected illegal fishing off South Korea's west coast.https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/seoul-protests-to- beijing-over-sinking-of-coast-guard- vessel/2016/10/10/4654fa68-8eb8-11e6-bc00-1a9756d4111b_story.html The incidents of illegal Chinese entry continued and on 1 November 2016, South Korea ships opened fire on illegal Chinese boats. No casualties were reported. =Deployment of THAAD in South Korea=  Background  Chinese tourists to South Korea and year-on-year rate. From March 2017, tourists plummeted in retaliation for the installation of THAAD. In late 2016, the United States and South Korea jointly announced the deployment of the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), allegedly in response to nuclear and missile threats by North Korea.Sherman, Paul Haenle and Anne. \\"The Real Answer to China's THAAD Dilemma.\\" The Diplomat. The Diplomat, 12 Sept. 2016. The U.S. states that the deployment of the THAAD is “purely a defensive measure… only aimed at North Korea” and has no intention to threaten China's security interests. But China has continuously expressed its opposition over South Korea and U.S.’s decision because of its concern that the deployment of THAAD might be a measure by the U.S. to contain China.\\"Background Briefing with a Senior Administration Official on National Security Advisor Susan Rice's Visit to China July 26, 2016.\\" Beijing/China.

Opposition from China  Stating that the THAAD will undermine China's own nuclear deterrent capability, China’s Ambassador Qiu Guohong warned that the deployment of THAAD could “destroy” the China–South Korea ties in an instant, whereas the spokesperson of the president of South Korea warned China that deploying the THAAD is a “matter we will decide upon according to our own security and national interests.\\" Tiezzi, Shannon. \\"China Warns THAAD Deployment Could Destroy South Korea Ties 'in an Instant'\\" The Diplomat.

For aims of a détente (a relaxation of tension), China and South Korea held a summit in Hangzhou, eastern China, on Sept. 5, 2016 with each party's leaders Xi Jinping and Park Geun-Hye to discuss the issue of THAAD. During the summit, Park reemphasized that the THAAD deployment is only to be aimed against North Korea and that there should be no reason for China's security interest to be concerned. However, Xi reiterated China's firm stance against the deployment of THAAD stating that it could “intensify disputes\\". Yet, the two countries still emphasized the long history of their relationship and agreed that a stable and healthy bilateral relationship will benefit both countries.Song, Sang-Ho. \\"Yonhap News Agency.\\" (6th LD) Park, Xi Reconfirm Differences pt. 2016.  Effect of THAAD on South Korea's economy  Unit sales and year-on-year rate in China. From March 2017, unit sales plummeted in retaliation for the installation of THAAD. With South Korea's decision in 2017 to accept the deployment of THAAD in the country, although China's government shied away from formal sanctions and measures, it has urged its citizens through official media to express their displeasure and ill will at South Korea over the move. Chinese citizens were allowed to gather to protest. The news media has reported of citizen boycotts of South Korean products like Hyundai cars, of South Korean goods being removed from supermarket shelves, and tourists and travel companies canceling trips to South Korea. South Korean conglomerate Lotte Group became a particular focus. Lotte had agreed to an exchange of land, a golf course in Seongju, with the South Korean government that will be used for the THAAD deployment. In addition to a consumer boycott of Lotte stores in China, municipal authorities suddenly discovered that Lotte stores and factories to be in contravention of fire safety regulations and other local ordinances which has resulted in the closure of 75 out of 99 Lotte supermarkets. March sales of Hyundai and its sister brand Kia Motors in China plunged 52 per cent from a year earlier to 72,000 vehicles, the lowest level since 2014. Chinese tourism also plummeted 39.4% (compared to March 2016) in March. As a result, China has become a more hated country in South Korea than even Japan, according to an opinion poll conducted by the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in March 2017.Alex Linder(2017-03-22):South Koreans now hate China even more than Japan, new opinion polls says, Shanghaiist As a result, South Korea's distribution industry suffered. Chinese consumers were no longer attracted to Korean products and Chinese retailers boycotted Korean products. As a result of decreased Chinese consumption, South Korean department stores, duty-free, restaurants, and the automobile industry were severely affected. However, Korean conglomerates had to survive since China is the largest market in the world. Hyundai had to stop the operation of Chinese factories and the economic losses were significant. The vicious cycle has been repeated as the decline of sales volume caused production suspension. Chinese automobile component manufacturing companies suspended distribution to Hyundai automobile factories that are located in China and it negatively affected the management of Hyundai automobile. THAAD had a tremendous impact on Korean economy in various business sectors and tarnished the brand value of Korean companies because of political reasons.  Culture  Korean culture, singers, actors and dancers are popular with Chinese youth because of the development of the internet and export of Korean cultural content. After the THAAD dispute took place, a \\"Korea limitation order\\" () was placed upon Hallyu. In China, Hallyu cultural events were canceled, Korean actors had to quit from their works and limited Korean media could be exported to China. The ban was lifted soon after, and relations cooled. Historical controversies The Chinese historical claims surrounding Goguryeo and its related kingdoms created some tension between Korea and the PRC.02Gries.pmd The PRC government has recently begun the Northeast Project, a controversial Chinese government research project claiming Goguryeo and other various Korean kingdoms, including Gojoseon, Buyeo and Balhae, to be Chinese tributary states. This sparked a massive uproar in South Korea when the project was widely publicized in 2004.Donga Monthly. http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD∣=sec&sid1;=101&oid;=037&aid;=0000006961  Joint stance on Japan  Due to the Empire of Japan and atrocities committed by the Imperial Japanese Army on both Koreans and Chinese, from women who supplied sex during WWII(known as comfort women) and the Japanese colonization of Korea to the Nanjing Massacre and Unit 731, South Korea and China are unified in their stance against Japan and insistence on greater reparations for Japan wartime atrocities. = 1910-1945 provisional ROK government = When the Korean peninsula was colonized by Imperial Japan, the provisional government of the ROK in exile in Shanghai received the support of China. = Japanese war crimes = Both the governments of China and South Korea take a firm stand on issues in relation to Japanese war crimes. Korea had been under Japanese rule after the collapse of the Joseon Dynasty in 1910. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Japan invaded and occupied eastern China. During World War II, the Imperial Japanese Army perpetrated many war crimes against both Chinese and Koreans. This has caused both to oppose the Japanese government's stand on war crimes committed during the war. Issues where both the Chinese and South Korean governments stand together include the controversial visits of Japanese politicians to the Yasukuni Shrine, the Japanese history textbook controversies, and comfort women. = An Jung-geun = In 2014, a memorial dedicated to Korean assassin An Jung-geun was opened in the Chinese city of Harbin, where he assassinated Japanese Prime Minister Itō Hirobumi in 1909. The Japanese government protested the move, referring to An as a \\"terrorist\\".  Public opinion  Survey published in 2019 by the Pew Research Center found that 63% of South Koreans had an unfavourable view of China. During the COVID-19 pandemic, more than half a million South Korean citizens have signed a petition lobbying the government to ban Chinese from entering the country.

WHIO (1290 kHz) is a commercial AM radio station licensed to Dayton, Ohio. The station is owned by the Cox Media Group, and airs a news/talk radio format simulcast with co-owned 95.7 WHIO-FM. Its studios and offices are at 1611 South Main Street in Dayton, along with WHIO-FM, 99.1 WHKO, 95.3 WZLR, Channel 7 WHIO-TV and the Dayton Daily News in the Cox Media Center building. WHIO broadcasts with a power of 5,000 watts from a transmitter near East David Road in Kettering, Ohio.Radio-Locator.com/WHIO WHIO is non-directional in the daytime. But at night, when radio waves travel farther, it operates with a directional antenna using a three-tower array, to avoid interfering with other stations on AM 1290. Programming WHIO-AM-FM are home to popular syndicated conservative talk hosts Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Brian Kilmeade, Dana Loesch, Chad Benson and Coast to Coast AM with George Noory. WHIO-AM-FM also carry Clark Howard, based at Cox Radio's flagship station WSB Atlanta. \\"Miami Valley's Morning News\\" is WHIO's morning drive time news and interview wake-up show. On weekends the station airs shows on money, health, cars, guns, and gardening. Some weekend shows are paid brokered programming. WHIO-AM-FM serve as the radio home for University of Dayton football and basketball. The station is a CBS network affiliate. History =Move from Pennsylvania= WHIO was Cox Radio's first station started by company founder Ohio Governor James M. Cox in the Dayton Daily News building downtown, on Ludlow Street. It signed on the air on February 9, 1935.Broadcasting Yearbook 1936 page 82 To create a new radio service in Dayton, Cox had to purchase WLBW in Oil City, Pennsylvania, from the Petroleum Telephone Company. Cox shut down that operation and moved the radio station to Dayton. The station first broadcast at a power of 1,000 watts on 1260 kHz, which had been the frequency of WLBW. With the enactment of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA) in 1941, WHIO moved to its current frequency at 1290 kHz. 90% of all AM stations in America were forced to change frequencies. =NBC and CBS= At its founding, WHIO was an NBC Red Network affiliate, also taking some shows from the NBC Blue Network. But in the 1940s, WHIO switched to the CBS Radio Network. During the \\"Golden Age of Radio,\\" WHIO carried NBC and later CBS's schedule of dramas, comedies, news, sports, soap operas, game shows and big band broadcasts. Then, as network programming moved from radio to television, WHIO switched to a full service middle of the road format of popular music, news and sports.Broadcasting Yearbook 1977 page C-162 =WHIO-FM and TV= In 1946, Cox Radio added an FM station, 99.1 WHIO-FM. At first, WHIO-FM simulcast the AM station. But in the 1960s, it began airing a beautiful music format. And in 1989, it became WHKO with a country music format. In 1949, Cox added a TV station, WHIO-TV on Channel 13 (later on Channel 7). Because WHIO had been an CBS affiliate, WHIO-TV also began airing CBS Television programs. =Noted Personalities= WHIO's long history in the market included Lou Emm. Emm was a popular host of variety shows, live remote broadcasts and station promotions. He started at WHIO in the early 1940s and retired in 1992. When Emm died a few years later, all Dayton radio stations paused for a moment of silence. Phil Donahue started at WHIO as the host of the weekday talk show \\"Conversation Piece\\" in the 1960s before his move to television and competitor Channel 2 WLWD (now WDTN) in 1967. His show became nationally syndicated beginning in 1970. During this era, Winston Hoehner was news director at WHIO for 25 years and was a member of the Ohio Associated Press Broadcast Journalism Hall of Fame. He died in 1990. WHIO was the originating station of a regional news network in the 1960s and '70s which was aired late afternoons on stations in surrounding communities throughout the Miami Valley as \\"The DP&L; News Network\\" (named for its sponsor, The Dayton Power and Light Company). A similar network aired in the 1990s during this same time frame as \\"The Newscenter 7 Radio Network.\\" =FM Simulcast= On October 30, 2006, Cox Radio pulled the plug on the all-1980 hits format on WDPT \\"95.7 The Point.\\" The station switched to a simulcast of WHIO's News/Talk format. 95.7 WHIO-FM has an effective radiated power of 50,000 watts and covers much of south central Ohio, also reaching into Eastern Indiana. The simulcast gives listeners the choice of hearing WHIO on either FM or AM. =30th Anniversary= The following comes from a station history written on January 14, 1965. It was discovered inside a box of reel to reel tape at the station in 2007, written on the letterhead of the Miami Valley Broadcasting Corporation (which was a division of Cox Broadcasting Corporation then.) Any updated information inside this history was added by the editor: :\\"At 4 pm Tuesday, February 9, 1965, WHIO, a pioneer radio station in this area will have been on the air 30 years and will start the celebration of another anniversary. :It was 4 pm Saturday afternoon in 1935 when the station signed on the air with a prayer given by Rev. Herman Page of St. Paul's Episcopal Church. Later that evening, a dedicatory dinner was held at the Miami Hotel attended by approximately 900 invited guests. :At 6 pm, the full NBC network saluted the station with a half-hour program which included the late Will Rogers, Amos 'n' Andy-the top entertainers at that time, The Pickens Sisters, Tim and Irene-a comedy team, and former Daytonians Carol Deis and John Alda Lewis. :At 7:30 pm, a program from the hotel was broadcast over the network which included the late Graham McNamee as announcer, Paul Katz directing the Dayton Philharmonic Orchestra, The Wilberforce Mixed Octet, vocalist Marjorie Squires, Gene and Glenn, Hiram and Henry, Jesse Crawford at the WHIO pipe organ, and talks by former Governor James M. Cox, James M. Cox, Junior - President of the Miami Valley Broadcasting Company and Colonial Richard Patterson, executive Vice President of NBC, who came to Dayton for the dedication. :At the speaker's table sat 32 prominent business and industrial leaders, the presidents of seven colleges, Orville Wright and the commander of Wright Field, Lt. Col. C.H. Pratt. :The first transmitter was built on the Brandt Pike, utilizing two towers each 293 feet high. The studios were in the building next to the Daily News building at 45 South Ludlow Street. All of the equipment and furnishings were new and the studios were especially built \\"floating type\\", which meant no building vibration was transferred through the building into the studios. :Only 3 stations in the country used the 1260 kHz frequency in 1935, of which WHIO was one, and the station broadcast with a power of 1,000 watts. On Sunday, June 28, 1936, the power was increased to 5,000 watts, the present power. :In January 1941, the FCC changed all radio frequencies, moving them ahead 30 Kilocycles and from that date, WHIO has been on 1290 KC. It was also early in 1941 when land was purchased on Hempstead Road south of Dayton and a new tower system installed. The transmitter is still in this location, but, through the years, new equipment and modification of the old to maintain peak technical performance has been installed. (Editor's note: Hempstead Road is now known as East David Road. :One other change was made 18 months after going on the air. On October 1, 1936, WHIO became a basic station of the Columbia Broadcasting System, and has been a member of the leading network since that date. Editor's note: WHIO remained a CBS affiliate until the 1990s. It first switched to A.P. (Associated Press) Network News, then to CNN Radio,Fox News and finally, CBS News, its present affiliation. :The brief address of Governor Cox given on the network the night of the dedication has since become the hallmark of the radio station. It dedicated the station to service to the community and gave the steel construction and electronic equipment an immediate personality and prestige which was magnified in the programs which have been presented in the past 30 years. Titled, \\"The Soul Of Radio\\", dedication talk in part reads as follows: :Birth is always a solemn thing and our emotions are deeply stirred as WHIO is announced as a new thing of life. May I express this christening sentiment - that the voice of this Miami Valley empire will always be an instrument of dignity, culture and practical service, that it will carry the light of joy to places that are dark, that it will build a love of googness and beauty, that it will plant in the hearts of men a philosophy that will help them to see Divinity in sunshine and shadow, that it will sense its obligations to the more than a million people who are by common interest to be our immediate radio fireside. In brief, may WHIO in its long watches of the night and in its endless days be conscious of its duty to God and humanity. :During its first year of operation the station marked up many \\"firsts\\" for radio in this area. Among these were the first from a courtroom when microphones were taken into the Municipal Court of Judge Null M. Hodapp for live broadcasts of traffic cases, the first broadcast of a Montgomery County basketball tournament, when former Congressman Paul F. Schenck was tournament chairman, the first remote broadcasts from Russells Point Ballroom on Indian Lake where all the big band names of the day made their appearance, and many more firsts of significant local nature. :In its 30 years of operation, WHIO always prided itself on not following the foolish fads in broadcasting and temporary tastes in music. Rather it has, over the 30 years, played the type of music and presented the kind of programs which has appealed to the great majority of listeners. Thus, it has earned its position as one of the great local stations in the country.\\" :Editor's note: Oddly enough, in 1984, then WHIO Program Director Mike Scott, in an attempt to make the station's audience younger and hipper, flipped the musical format to a Hot AC-Adult CHR hybrid. It seemed unusual to hear longtime morning host Lou Emm introducing songs such as \\"Like A Virgin\\" by Madonna and \\"I Want A New Drug\\" from Huey Lewis and the News. The experiment did attract a significant increase in younger listeners, however, the station's image remained well entrenched in the older adult audience. This was during the time traditional AM stations were moving away from music formats and into News and Talk based formats. The Corporate office eventually flipped the station back to its original Middle of the Road formula, featuring artists such as Anne Murray and Christopher Cross, and then on into its current News and Talk format, as it finally abandoned music programming entirely.
