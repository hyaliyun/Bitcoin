When a small force of American cavalry was leaving the city of Parral, in the Mexican state of Chihuahua, a superior force of Carrancista soldiers attacked which resulted in a bloody running engagement. Using a strategy of organized withdrawal, the Americans were able to repulse the Mexican attacks and safely escape to the fortified village of Santa Cruz de Villegas.Boot, pg. 201-203  Battle  In early April 1916, Major Frank Tompkins, who fought in the Battle of Columbus, persuaded the expedition commander, General John J. Pershing, to allow him to lead eight officers and 120 men of Troops K and M, 13th Cavalry, on a raid deep into Mexican territory. Tompkins' intentions were to chase and eventually engage the elusive rebels of Pancho Villa. After preparations were completed, Major Tompkins left camp on or about April 5. The Americans made a quick ride across the Mexican desert, traveling eighty-five miles in fifty hours. Following several days in the wilderness, Tompkins wrote; \\"We were ragged, shoes were gone and nearly everyone had a beard. We certainly presented a hard-boiled, savage appearance.\\" The Americans were hoping to rest at Parral for a day, and they were told they'd be welcome by a Carrancista officer along the way. However, when the column arrived at Parral in the early morning of April 12, the Constitutionalist commander of the city, General Ismael Lozano, informed Major Tompkins that coming to the city was a bad idea and that he must leave immediately. Tompkins agreed so the Americans left Parral not long after getting there.Boot, pg. 201 On the way out of town, a group of Mexicans began shouting \\"Viva Villa\\", and other phrases, so Tompkins shouted the same back. A few minutes later, as the column was just outside town, a mounted force of about 550 Carrancistas launched an attack on the American column. In the first few shots a sergeant standing next to Tompkins was killed and a second man seriously wounded. Heavily outnumbered, Tompkins had no choice but to keep going, and he dismounted a rear guard to take up positions on a small hill and delay the pursuing Mexicans. In this first skirmish, about twenty-five Mexicans were killed and the rest driven off. The rear guard then regrouped with the main force, where they soon withstood another attack. During this second skirmish, another forty-five Mexicans were killed. Tompkins continued his march to Santa Cruz de Villegas, a fortified town, eight miles from Parral, that the Americans could defend. Though by the time of their arrival the fighting had ceased. The Mexicans were not far away, Tompkins was facing the possibility of his 100-man force being besieged by hundreds of Carrancistas, so he sent out dispatch riders for reinforcements.Boot, pg. 202 Just before 8:00 am, a force of Buffalo Soldiers, from the 10th Cavalry, arrived. They had recently engaged about 150 Villistas at the Battle of Agua Caliente on April 1. Following the arrival of reinforcements, the Mexicans retreated back to Parral, there was no more fighting. Two Americans were killed in the battle and six others were wounded, including Tompkins. For the Mexicans, they suffered the loss of between fourteen and seventy killed or wounded, depending on varying accounts.Boot, pg. 202  Aftermath  The Battle of Parral was a turning point in the Mexican Expedition, it marked America's furthest penetration into Mexico during the operation, 516 miles from the border, and marked the beginning of a slow withdrawal from Mexico which ended in early 1917. General Pershing was encamped at Satevo, eighty miles north of Parral, when he heard news of the engagement at Parral. According to the journalist Frank B. Elser, of The New York Times, Pershing was \\"mad as hell\\" so he demanded that the Carrancista government, which by then was in control of Mexico, to make a formal apology. It never came and it made General Pershing believe that instead of fighting just the rebels of Pancho Villa, he would now have to engage the \\"more numerous\\" Carrancista army. Pershing even requested permission from his commanding officer, General Frederick Funston, to capture both the state and capital of Chihuahua, but it was denied.Boot, pg. 202  References   Bibliography  * Parral Parral Parral Parral Parral Parral Parral Category:1916 in Mexico Category:April 1916 events ","title":"Battle of Parral"},{"id":"33019958","text":"Nawab Ibrahim Mohammad Yakut Khan II of Sachin (1833‚Äì1873) Merchant Flag Nawab of Sachin Ibrahim Mohammad Yakut Khan III withheld public recognition of his marriage to Fatima Begum. The Sachin State (; ) was a princely state belonging to the Surat Agency, former Khandesh Agency, of the Bombay Presidency during the era of the British Raj. Its capital was in Sachin, the southernmost town of present-day Surat district of Gujarat State.  History  Sachin state was founded on 6 June 1791. Though over 85% of the subjects were Hindu, the state was ruled by Sunni Muslims of the Siddi dynasty of Danfa-Rajpuri and Janjira State. The Siddi dynasty is of Abyssinian (Habesha) origin. Sachin State was under the protection of the Maratha Peshwa until it became a British protectorate. It had its own cavalry, currency, and stamped paper, as well as a state band that included Africans. Fatima Begum (1892‚Äì1983), one of the early superstars in Indian cinema and India's first female film director, was allegedly married to Nawab Sidi Ibrahim Muhammad Yakut Khan III of Sachin State.

The Roman Catholic parish of St. Lawrence was then turned into an Orthodox church, by decree of the Tsar himself. Although the cemetery was officially consecrated in 1841, the first burials took place there as early as 1836. In 1905 a new church, St. John the Ladder was built, while St. Lawrence Church returned to the Roman Catholic church after Poland regained its independence.

The second 'zone' included the graves of lower rank officers, clerks and wealthy merchants. The third 'zone' housed the graves of soldiers and members of the bourgeoisie, while the poorest were buried in the area furthest from the church.

He made his test debut on September 16, 2011 and took a wicket with his first ball, becoming the 15th player to do so in the history of test cricket. His constant back injuries meant that he couldn't make the national team regularly after his Test debut, and his next international game came much later, in August 2012 against India, in which he made his Twenty20 International debut. Health and Bowling suspect On 19 June 2016, following Sri Lanka's ODI matches in Ireland, Eranga was admitted to hospital in Dublin to undergo tests on his heart. However, on the same day, he was suspended from bowling in international matches by the International Cricket Council (ICC) due to an illegal action reported during the second Test against England earlier the previous month. He was discharged from hospital the following day. On 18 July 2017, ICC cleared Eranga bowling action, so he can play again in international cricket with his revised bowling action. Domestic career During Sri Lanka Premier League tournament, he played for Nagenahira Nagas, where his team became runner-up of SLPL, lost final to Uva Next. He won Player of the series trophy for his bowling performances.

Invasive species Several species, most notably the central Asian Kali tragus, are invasive species outside their native range. They have encroached into parts of North America, where they are listed as noxious weeds by the United States Department of Agriculture. The salt- tolerant genus was first reported in the United States around 1877 in Bon Homme County, South Dakota, apparently transported as a stowaway in flax seed exported by Ukrainian farmers. South Dakota proved too harsh and dry for growing flax, however, and by 1900 Kali had colonized as far west as the Pacific Coast. It was also actively introduced by the USDA as experimental food for cattle that could be grown in hard times during droughts. Palatability of the young shoots is considered to be fair. Cattle, sheep, and horses eat it if nothing better is available. Small rodents and pronghorn also graze on the young shoots. Kali thrives wherever land use has disturbed the soil. It can be seen in Death Valley, California, and in Colorado at elevations of 8500 feet (2600 m).

He was a war leader of the NgƒÅpuhi who lead the war expedition against the MƒÅori tribes at East Cape in 1820 and 1821. He also led the war expeditions to Tauranga and Maketu in 1832 and 1833, following the incident in the Bay of Islands that is known as the Girls' War. He was the son of HƒÅpai and the grandson of Toko. He was the brother of Rapu. Tƒ´tore was the nephew of TƒÅreha, principal rangatira of the NgƒÅti Rƒìhia hap≈´ (sub-tribe), of Kerikeri, and he was related to H≈çne Heke and Hengi of NgƒÅti Rƒìhia. He married a sister of Hongi Hika. He lived at Waimate North; then after the Girls‚Äô War he lived at KororƒÅreka in the Bay of Islands, as the peace settlement after the Girl's War resulted in his receiving KororƒÅreka as reparation for the death of his relation, Hengi. Visit to England In 1815 Tƒ´tore went to Port Jackson (Sydney, Australia), and spent 2 years with the Revd Samuel Marsden. In 1817 Tƒ´tore and Tui (also known as Tuhi or Tupaea (1797?-1824)) sailed to England in the brig, Kangaroo.NZETC: Maori Wars of the Nineteenth Century, 1816 They visited Professor Samuel Lee at Cambridge University and assisted him in the preparation of a grammar and vocabulary of MƒÅori which, following a visit to Lee by Hongi Hika and Waikato, was published in 1820 as First Grammar and Vocabulary of the New Zealand Language. Tƒ´tore‚Äôs and Te Wera‚Äôs southern expedition 1820-21 In April 1821, Tƒ´tore and the chief Te Wera from Okura, returned to the Bay of Islands after 16 months of fighting against the tribes on the East Coast of the North Island at Tolaga Bay and Poverty Bay.Smith, S. Percy ‚Äì Maori Wars of the Nineteenth Century (Christchurch 1910) page 167. online at NZETC Tƒ´tore‚Äôs war expeditions in 1832 & 1833 In the peace settlement at the end of the Girls' War, KororƒÅreka (today known as Russell) was ceded to Tƒ´tore by P≈çmare II as compensation for Hengi's death, which was accepted by those engaged in the fighting. However, the duty of seeking revenge had passed to Mango and Kakaha, the sons of Hengi; they took the view that the death of their father should be acknowledged through a muru,\\"Traditional Maori Concepts, Muru\\" Ministry of Justice website or war expedition, against tribes to the south. It was within MƒÅori traditions to conduct a muru against tribes who had no involvement in the events that caused the death of an important chief. Tƒ´tore did not commence the muru until January 1832.Rogers, Lawrence M. (editor)(1961) - The Early Journals of Henry Williams 1826 to 1840. Christchurch : Pegasus Press. online available at New Zealand Electronic Text Centre (NZETC) The Revd Henry Williams accompanied the first expedition, without necessarily believing that he could end the fighting, but with the intention of continuing to persuade the combatants as to the Christian message of peace and goodwill. The journal of Henry Williams provides an extensive account of this expedition, which can be described as an incident in the so-called Musket Wars. The NgƒÅpuhi warriors, who included H≈çne Heke, were successful in battles on the Mercury Islands and at Tauranga, with the muru continuing until late July 1832. In February 1833 Tƒ´tore consulted Tohitapu, a Tohunga, to foresee the success of a second war expedition;Smith, S. Percy ‚Äì Maori Wars of the Nineteenth Century (Christchurch 1910) page 450. online at NZETC then Tƒ´tore led a party of Te Rarawa, allies of the NgƒÅpuhi, back to Tauranga. Williams also accompanied the second expedition. Exchanging gifts with William IV Tƒ´tore was one of 13 northern rangatira who signed a letter to King William IV in 1831, seeking an alliance with the United Kingdom; with a request to the King to become \\"friend and guardian of these Islands\\" to protect them from the \\"tribe of Marion\\", which is how the MƒÅori of the Bay of Islands referred to the French. The MƒÅori of the Bay of Islands were concerned about the French presence in the South Pacific as a consequence of the massacre of Marc-Joseph Marion du Fresne and 26 crewman, who were killed and cannibalized in the Bay of Islands in 1772. In 1834, F.W.R. Sadler of HMS Buffalo received gifts from Tƒ´tore for delivery to the King, which included two mere made of pounamu (which is a symbol of chieftainship). In 1835, the King sent him a suit of armour, now in the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa.  Declaration of Independence of the United Tribes of New Zealand On 28 October 1835, Tƒ´tore signed He Whakaputanga o te Rangatiratanga o Nu Tirene (known in English as the Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand), which proclaimed the sovereign independence of New Zealand. The Declaration arose in response to concerns over the lawlessness of British subjects in New Zealand, and in response to a fear that France would declare sovereignty over the islands. The document also arose from movements in MƒÅori society. From 1816 onwards, a number of Northern MƒÅori chiefs had made visits to New South Wales and Norfolk Island, as well as to England, leading to discussions about unifying the tribes and the formation of a MƒÅori government. MƒÅori had become involved in trade with New South Wales and owned trading ships. In 1834, the chiefs had selected a flag for use on ships originating from New Zealand. In the process of signing, the chiefs established themselves as representing a confederation under the title of the \\"United Tribes of New Zealand\\". 261  War with P≈çmare II Starting in March 1837, P≈çmare II fought a three-month war with Tƒ´tore. H≈çne Heke fought alongside Tƒ´tore. Tƒ´tore lead 800 warriors in 42 war canoes against P≈çmare's PƒÅ at Otuihu in the Bay of Islands, although the PƒÅ had strong defences and the attacks in March and April were repulsed. An underlying cause of the fighting was a dispute as to the boundary line of the KororƒÅreka block that had been surrendered as a consequence of the death of Hengi some seven years previously in the Girls‚Äô War. The war ended in June 1837 following the death of Tƒ´tore; however, it is not clear whether he died as the results of battle wounds or following an illness. Following Tƒ´tore's death, HMS Rattlesnake fired a formal salute in his honour. Literature and sources * (1874) - The life of Henry Williams, Archdeacon of Waimate, Volume I. Auckland NZ.

Gian Galeazzo Sanvitale, also known as Galeazzo I Sanvitale (1496 - 2 December 1550) was an Italian condottiero, a member of the noble Sanvitale family. Biography Gian Galeazzo Sanvitale was born at Fontanellato, near Parma, to Jacopo Antonio and Veronica da Correggio, a few months after the battle of Fornovo, in which his elder brother Gian Francesco had fought under the French army of Charles VIII. At the death of his father, in 1511, he inherited the fiefs of Fontanellato, Noceto, Belforte and Pietramogolana. The following year, his mother also died, and Gian Galeazzo was tutored first by Gian Francesco and then by Galeotto Lupi, husband of Ludovica Sanvitale. During the Italian Wars, he remained faithful to the French. After the battle of Ravenna, in spite of being victorious, the latter had to abandon Emilia and Lombardy, and their local followers found themselves in a dangerous position. Parma was occupied by papal troops and Gian Francesco Sanvitale, perhaps forced to leave Fontanellato, asked his brother to submit to Pope Julius II. In December of the same year the property of the Rocca di Fontanellato was divided among them. Galeotto Lupi died in 1513, and Gian Galeazzo inherited his assets. In 1516 he married to Paola Gonzaga, daughter of Ludovico Gonzaga marquess of Sabbioneta. The court of Fontanellato became subsequently an active cultural center, thanks to the patronage of Sanvitale himself, of his wife, his brother Gian Ludovico and, above all, Girolamo Sanvitale, count of Sala Baganza. In 1522 Sanvitale was appointed as colonel of the King of France and helped his cousin Girolamo in the struggle against the Rossi of Parma. In 1525, after the French defeat in the Battle of Pavia, the Sanvitale suffered heavy attacks from the communal troops of Parma, but he remained loyal to Francis I of France, and later he received the French citizenship in reward. In 1536, together with Girolamo Sanvitale, he was declared a rebel against the papal power. In 1539‚Äì1540, with the collaboration of the Pico and the French support, he attempted a coup in Cremona, but this was discovered and thwarted by the imperials. When, in 1545, Pier Luigi Farnese became lord of Parma, Sanvitale shared with him the philo-French stance. After the new duke was killed at Piacenza, he fortified Fontanellato and resisted the troops of Ferrante Gonzaga, Spanish governor of Milan, refusing to submit to emperor Charles V. He died near Parma at the beginning of the War of Parma.

A Jew, his grandfather was an engineer in Constantinople, and his father was the first soap manufacturer in the Ottoman Empire. Life At the age of ten, Jacob was sold as a slave to a pasha, who educated him. He acquired knowledge of Eastern life, language, art, literature, philosophy, and occultism. After his master's death, Jacob performed the Hajj to Mecca at the age of 21, indicating that he was then a Muslim. Jacob moved to Bombay, where he worked as a clerk based on his knowledge of Arabic. Later, he moved to Hyderabad, where he worked for Ami-ul- Kabir, father of Sir Kharsheedjah Bahadur; from there, he moved to Calcutta, where he worked for the jewellers Charles Nephew and Co. He then worked for the Nawab of Rampur and Dholpur for a short time. Jacob arrived in Simla in the 1870s and founded a business trading precious gemstones and curios. The success of the business allowed him to build and maintain a luxury home, known as Belvedere, in Simla. The quality of his work resulted in a clientele composed of some of the wealthiest and most influential people in India. The Pioneer found him 'endowed by nature with a wonderful handsome face and form' and there was about him a 'compelling magnetism, a power and mystery which led to his being sought for conversation and advice by Viceroy and princes'. Reports indicate he was celibate, a vegetarian, a teetotaller, and a non- smoker. Jacob diamond He is best known for having sold the Jacob Diamond, which is the seventh largest diamond known in the world (previously known as the Victoria Diamond, Imperial Diamond, or Great White Diamond). It was owned by the Nizam of Hyderabad and is currently owned by the Government of India. The sale of the Jacob Diamond to Mir Mahbub Ali Khan, Nizam of Hyderabad, considered to be one of the richest men in the world, ruined Jacob. He was brought to trial on charges of fraud, and was acquitted only after a long trial at the Calcutta High Court. Jacob was unable to obtain the money due to him, as the court had no jurisdiction over the Indian States. Nor was there any mechanism to get the diamond back. The controversy over the sale cost Jacob his customers. Legal expenses and the default of other princes bankrupted him, who left Simla for Bombay in late 1901. Jacob lost his eyesight, and after fourteen years of blindness was cured by the charity of a surgeon friend. His last years were spent in a modest room at Watson's Annexe, a property facing the Bombay Yacht Club. Jacob's last words (to Alice Dracott) were \\"Give my love to Simla\\". He died in 1921 and his obituary notice in The Times of 21 January 1921 states Jacob \\"claimed to be a Turk ... born near Constantinople\\". Popular culture American author F. Marion Crawford wrote the novel Mr. Isaacs about him in 1882. The character Lurgan Sahib of Rudyard Kipling's novel Kim was also based on Jacob. A biography by John Zubrzycki, The Mysterious Mr Jacob: diamond merchant, magician and spy [], was published in 2017.

Details The cemetery was established in 1792 and is located in the Wola district. The cemetery bore witness to many historical events: fighting on its premises took place during the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising of 1794, the November Uprising (1830-1831) and the Warsaw Uprising (1944). The fence, the monuments and the architecture of the cemetery were all destroyed during the last of the afore-mentioned events, and were rebuilt in the second half of the 20th century. Despite the historical turmoil, many monuments of great artistic value have somehow managed to survive and still stand today - one of them being the Kronenberg Chapel, which is included in the National Historical Monument Register. The Evangelical Reformed Cemetery is maintained by the Polish Reformed Church, but the cemetery is ecumenical and accepts interments from other Protestant denominations and members of the Church of England (Anglicans). A monument dedicated to those killed during the Nazi occupation of Poland is made out of the rubble of destroyed tombstones.

(1872 - 21 January 1924) was a leading Australian rules football field umpire in the Victorian Football League (VFL) at its formation in the 1890s, and with the West Australian Football League in the early 1900s. Known as the VFL's \\"Prince of Umpires\\"For example: Ivo Crapp, The Prince of Umpires, The (Perth) Sunday Times, (Sunday, 25 May 1913), p.3. ‚Äî \\"in the capacity of central umpire he attained a degree of skill which stamped him as a prodigy, and one who was without peer in the history of the Australian game\\"The (Perth) Daily News, (Monday, 21 January 1924), p.8.] ‚Äî he umpired the first ever match in that league. Early life The son of Henry Crapp, and Emma Crapp (n√©e Snell), Henry \\"Harry\\" Crapp was born in Victoria in 1872. He married Priscilla \\"Prissie\\" Hulley (1875-1949) in 1895.Deaths: Crapp, The West Australian, (Monday, 23 May 1949), p.1. They had three children, Edward, Thomas, and May (later, Mrs. D.N. Clair). =\\"Ivo\\", not \\"Ivor\\"= Harry's brother, William Henry Crapp (1865-1946),Deaths: Crapp, The Age, (Tuesday, 24 December 1946), p.8. was known as \\"Ivo\\", due to his close facial resemblance to Ivo Bligh, 8th Earl of Darnley who had visited Australia in 1882/1883 as the captain of the first-ever English cricket team to play an Ashes series in Australia. Once William retired from football, Harry became known far and wide as \\"Ivo\\", inheriting his brother's nickname.  Playing career  Crapp played just four games for Carlton in the VFA during the 1893 season before taking up umpiring. His older brother, William, who played at full-back and \\"was a beautiful kick for goal\\", also played with Carlton in the VFA at the same time.William H. Crapp, \\"Blueseum.  Umpiring career  = VFA/VFL = Crapp started his umpiring career in the Victorian Football Association in 1895. When the newly formed Victorian Football League commenced in 1897, he was appointed to the first match at Corio Oval between Geelong and Essendon. He was also the field umpire in the VFL's first-ever Grand Final, between Fitzroy and Essendon, on 24 September 1898. Crapp was well regarded by the footballers; no doubt his height, at 6\\"1', also gave him some authority. He was considered to be a very competent umpire, and well able to discern a \\"stage\\" for a free kick. He was also proud of the (then unusual) ability to refer to all players by their names during the course of a match. In 1901, Crapp began the practice of calling the reasons for free kicks and nominating who was to take the kick by name. This innovation was soon generally adopted by all of the umpires. Crapp umpired at a time when the field umpire had to not only control the field play, but also return the ball into play once out of bounds (boundary umpires commenced in 1904 ). Furthermore, until 1922, the field umpire also had to return the ball to the centre following the scoring of a goal. Luckily, the overall pace of games was much slower than in the more modern eras, and Crapp maintained a relatively high standard of fitness. By 1905, his record stood at 198 matches - 147 of them in the VFL - including 17 finals and 7 Grand Finals (1898‚Äì1902 and 1904‚Äì05). In addition he umpired interstate matches in 1899, 1902 and 1905. = WAFL = In 1906, Crapp was enticed to move to Kalgoorlie, Western Australia on the promise of employment and a contract from the Goldfields Football Association. Crapp found that no job existed for him, the proposed employment having fallen through, and departed by train to Perth, intending to return to Melbourne. WAFL officials, however, managed to intercept Crapp and convince him to umpire the first round in their Perth- based competition. The League quickly offered him a contract having seen the quality of his umpiring. He was as outstanding in the WAFL as he had been in the VFL, and he was appointed to the 1906 finals series and the Grand Final. He became the first-choice umpire in the WAFL and he umpired every final until 1914 ‚Äì a total of 30 in all. Crapp also umpired four West Australian State Premiership matches; in 1906, 1909 and 1913. Although some assert that Crapp coached East Perth in 1909, it seems unlikely. Records indicate that he also umpired every week that season, including a final in which East Perth played; and, so perhaps he may have been active in some other capacity with the club, given that Ben Wallish, the team's captain, was also their coach.Henry Crapp, VFL's First \\"Prince of Umpires\\", Australian Football League Umpires Association. Note that, although the Subiaco Football Club's \\"Honour Roll\\" clearly states that its 1910 captain-coach was Jack Diprose,See also: Jack Diprose, australian football.com. an April 1910 press report states that \\"Ivor Crapp is coaching the Subiaco 18 this season\\";Football Flashes, The (Perth) Truth, (Saturday, 23 April), p.11.. and so it may be that Crapp, from time to time, took on various advisory duties with various WAFL teams. In 1914, he travelled to Sydney as the Western Australian representative umpire at the Australian National Football Council Carnival. In the WAFL, Crapp umpired 177 games before his retirement in 1919, for a career total of 352 games. His last major appointment (by request of the VFL) was to the 1921 interstate match between Western Australia and Victoria ‚Äì at the astonishing age of 48. Death He died at his home in West Perth, Western Australia on 21 January 1924.\\"Ivo\\" Crapp Ill, The (Perth) Mirror, (Saturday, 8 December 1923), p.1.  Honours  Inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 1996, his citation read: :The VFL's first 'Prince of Umpires'. Moving from the VFA to the newly formed VFL, he officiated in round one, 1897, and retired in 1905 after 147 matches including seven Grand Finals. Moved to Western Australia where he coached East Perth in 1909 then returned to umpiring, adding 120 games and three WAFL grand finals to his senior total before retiring in 1920.

His later philosophy also draws on the works of poststructuralist philosophers such as Michel Foucault, J√ºrgen Habermas and Richard Rorty. This can be especially gauged from Wain‚Äôs interest in the concept of lifelong learning, which, he maintains, should not be infected with any mania for efficient productivity in relation to political ideology, but, on the contrary, should be imbued with a broad humanistic awareness. This corroborates Wain‚Äôs understanding of democracy, which, to him, has more to do with individual maturity and responsibility and less with State hegemony or political performance. According to Wain, education and democracy are handmaids of each other. His political, moral, and aesthetic, philosophies, to be sure, all stem from, and are based on, this foundation.

B√¶kslugten ravine caused by a storm in 1877  Description  On August 11, 1877 a violent storm that started at noon and lasted 1.5 hours turned the L√∏nstrup brook into a ravine that was 360 meters long, 15 meters wide and 4.5 meters deep (1180 ft long, 49 ft wide and 15 ft deep). Fishermen who were at sea during the storm knew nothing about the disaster at home until they saw parts of the destroyed houses, furniture and household items floating in the water. Six houses were torn from their foundations, four were demolished and two others were inhabitable and had to be razed. The ravine, now known as B√¶kslugten, still cuts through town. L√∏nstrup drew interest among Danes when it was used as a backdrop for the Oscar-winning Babette's Feast (Danish: Babettes g√¶stebud), a 1987 Danish drama directed by Gabriel Axel. L√∏nstrup consists mainly of one long road, Strandvejen (Beach Way), which meanders a few kilometers through the steep cliffs. The hills around the north of L√∏nstrup are dotted with summer cottages built around 1920. The area in and around L√∏nstrup attracts some 10,000 tourists a week during the summer season. Previously, many families in L√∏nstrup lived from fishing, but now there are only a few. L√∏nstrup is now better known for its many crafts studios and art galleries. There are glass blowers, potteries, jewelers, amber crafts, painters and sculptors who live and work in L√∏nstrup.Turistbureaus hjemmeside L√∏nstrup.dk A violent storm in 1981 prompted the establishment of better coastal protection, which is working as intended but, because the North Sea erodes the coastline, the beach nonetheless requires fresh sand to be spread out on the beach every year.

Some of the offshoots or independently organized local \\"TOWs\\", such as Tajna Organizacja Wojskowa Gryf Pomorski (\\"TOW Pomeranian Griffin\\") or Tajna Organizacja Wojskowa Gryf Kaszubski (\\"TOW Kaszubian Griffin\\") were active throughout the whole period of the German occupation as well as the early years of the Soviet takeover. During the interwar period, Polish intelligence services in the Grupa Operacyjnej Dywersji (Operational Group for Diversion) developed contingency plans for creating an underground movement in case the country was occupied by either Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia. The sub unit within this service codenamed Zygmunt was charged with preparing diversionary and sabotage actions to be carried out during the possible occupation. The main, country- wide, TOW was organized by Major (later colonel) Jan Mazurkiewicz, codename Rados≈Çaw, in late 1939, in Stanis≈Çaw√≥w, after the Polish defeat in the September campaign. Mazurkiewicz's founding of the group received approval from Gen. W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski and the Polish government in exile.

By 1884 it was known as simply the Comedy Theatre.

J. H. Addison held a plot of ground in Panton Street at the corner of Oxenden Street, for which he commissioned the architect Thomas Verity to design a theatre.\\"The Royal Comedy Theatre\\", The Morning Post, 11 October 1881, p. 2 The builders were Kirk and Randall of Woolwich.Mander and Mitchenson, p. 67 The original seating capacity was 1,186, comprising 140 stalls, 120 dress circle, 126 upper boxes, amphitheatre 100, pit 400 and gallery 300. the construction was completed in six months. The theatre was, and remains, a three-tier house, its exterior in the classical tradition in painted (stucco) stone and brick.

Flowers consist of 5 subequal membranous perianth segments, that are free nearly from base; 3-5 stamens without appendages; and an ovary with 2-3 thick and short stigmas. In fruit, prominent membranous wings develop on the back of the perianth segments, usually 2-3 of them larger than the others. Rarely, the perianth remains unwinged. The fruit may be baccate or dry, either vertical and compressed or nearly spherically shaped. The lenticular seed is vertically orientated, filled by the spiral embryo without endosperm.  Distribution  The genus Anabasis is distributed from Southwest Europe and North Africa, the shores of the Red Sea (Ethiopia) to Southwest Asia and Central Asia. The center of diversity lies in Asia. Anabasis species grow in steppes and semideserts.  Systematics  The genus name Anabasis was published in 1753 by Carl von Linn√© in Species Plantarum. Type species is Anabasis aphylla L. The genus Anabasis belongs to the tribe Salsoleae s.s., in the subfamily Salsoloideae of the family Amaranthaceae (which includes the family Chenopodiaceae). According to Akhani et al. (2007), the genus comprises 29 species: Anabasis aretioides * Anabasis aphylla L. * Anabasis aretioides Moq. & Coss. (Syn. Fredolia aretioides (Moq. & Coss. ex Bunge) Ulbr.) * Anabasis articulata (Forssk.) Moq. * Anabasis brevifolia C. A. Mey. * Anabasis brachiata Fisch. & C. A.

Chemistry The Nicotine-related alkaloid Anabasine was named for the toxic Central Asiatic species Anabasis aphylla - from which it was first isolated by Orechoff and Menschikoff in the year 1931. It was widely used as an insecticide in the former Soviet Union until 1970.Ujv√°ry, Istv√°n, Pest Control Agents from Natural Products - Chapter 3 of Hayes' Handbook of Pesticide Toxicology ( Third Edition ), ed. Robert Krieger, pub. Academic Press 2010. Anabasine is also the active principle responsible for deaths from poisoning caused by the leaves of Nicotiana glauca, the Tree Tobacco.Mizrachi, N.; Levy, S.; Goren, Z. Q.

BGL BNP Paribas was ranked as the top bank in Luxembourg based on tier 1 capital by The Banker magazine in a 2014 ranking. History The Banque G√©n√©rale du Luxembourg (BGL) was founded on 29 September 1919 by Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale de Belgique together with Luxembourg and Belgian partners. Its registered office was in Arlon, Belgium, and its head office in Luxembourg City. It quickly moved into new premises at 14, rue Aldringen. By 1928, it had become a large regional bank extending its operations to the neighbouring areas of Belgium and France. In 1935, its registered office was moved to Luxembourg where BGL became a Luxembourg corporation. In the 1960s, BGL became a key player in international financial services with cross-border transactions accounting for an increasing share of its operations. In the late 1970s, it entered the Eurobond market, opening offices in Milan, Hong Kong and Frankfurt and establishing Banque G√©n√©rale du Luxembourg (Suisse) in Zurich in 1982. On 29 November 1984, BGL shares were first traded on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.\\"The history of Fortis BGL BNP Paribas\\" , BGL BNP Paribas. Retrieved 9 September 2011 By 1999, BGL was acting as a commercial bank for its Luxembourg customers as well as an investment bank offering financial services to the international community. In February 2000, BGL and its majority shareholder Fortis formed a strategic partnership under which Fortis acquired over 97% of the bank's equity. In 2005, the bank changed its name to Fortis Bank Luxembourg. In 2008, the State of Luxembourg acquired 49.9% of the bank's shares and, in September 2008, invested EUR 2.5 billion in Fortis Bank Luxembourg. The following month, the Belgian and Luxembourg governments, in association with BNP Paribas, consolidated the Fortis business structures in Belgium and Luxembourg. In December, the State of Luxembourg became a 49.9% shareholder and changed the name of the bank to BGL. In May 2009, BNP Paribas became the majority shareholder (65.96%) in BGL, the State of Luxembourg retaining 34%. On 21 September, the bank's registered name was changed to BGL BNP Paribas and in February 2010, BGL BNP Paribas became the 100% owner of BNP Paribas Luxembourg. The transfer was finalised on 1 October 2010 with the incorporation of BNP Paribas Luxembourg's business in the operational platforms of BGL BNP Paribas. Recent performance The bank reported positive financial performance for the first six months of 2011 with a consolidated net profit of EUR 207.6 million and net banking income of EUR 400 million. Comparisons with the same period in 2010 were however difficult to make, given the integration of the bank into the BNP Paribas group.\\"BGL BNP Paribas financial performance at 30 June 2011\\" .

Barrow Bridge, which was once the longest bridge in Ireland, and Great Island Power Station now owned by Scottish Southern Energy SSE plc who purchased it from Endesa in 2012. The village is also surrounded by the Malting Woods which were planted by Cornelius Bolton. Toponymy The Irish name for Cheekpoint is \\"Pointe na S√≠ge\\", or perhaps \\"Pointe na S√≠\\" (in English, Point of the Fairies).logainm.ie; Irish Names and Places, P.W. Joyce Ll.D. (M.H. Gill & Son) It is also claimed to mean Point of the Streak,.Place Names of the Decies by Very Rev. Canon P. Power (Cork University Press) Now it is thought that the name comes from a rock called Carraig na S√≠ge out on the river near the low water mark which shows a trail of foam or streak with the ebbing tide.The River Book by Paddy Dwan and Mark Roper (Whimbrel Press) Subsequently it was called Bolton but this name is now no longer used and the original is the only one recognises. Industry Before the building of the pier at Dunmore East, Cheekpoint was a thriving village, being the station at which the mail packets from England for Waterford stopped. In addition there were cotton, rope, and hosiery factories which disappeared when the mail packet station was transferred to Dunmore East on July 1, 1818. History Cheekpoint and the lands which surrounded it were owned of the Aylward family from Bristol, who had been granted 7000 acres of pastureland by King Henry II in 1177. They held it until Oliver Cromwell dispossessed them in 1649 when they refused to renounce Catholicism. Cromwell then gave the property to one of his officers, a Captain William Bolton.History of Waterford by P.M. Egan In 1783 Cornelius Bolton (1751‚Äì1829) built Faithlegg House after he had inherited the Faithlegg Estate from his father in 1779.History of Waterford City and County by Patrick C. Power (Mercier Press) Cornelius Bolton was a very progressive landlord and he was very interested in helping his tenants to progress. He built the pier at the nearby village of Cheekpoint and then he built a textile factory, a rope factory and a hotel. However these enterprises failed and he went bankrupt in 1819. This was largely due to the mail packet station to Milford Haven in Wales being transferred to Dunmore East in 1818. Sleater's \\"Topography of Ireland\\" published in 1806 has the following reference:- \\"Bolton, formerly called Cheekpoint, cotton factory and hoisery, established by Mr. Bolton. A most commodious Inn for passengers in the packets to and from Milford Haven in Pembrokershire. An earlier writer refers to it - \\"Mr. Cornelius Bolton lives very retired in the country and has employed a considerable part of his fortune in building a large village where he has established several important manufactures, particularly looms. The industry which he encourages in his colony renders it probable that his expense will be repaid him, and that it will become an object of utility to the public and of profit to him although suggested by motives of humanity \\". It also mentions \\"that to the spirited exertions of Mr. Bolton the citizens of Waterford were said to be primarily indebted for the establishment of the packets from England, and that the diversion of these packets from Cheekpoint to Dunmore East would be a serious loss to the proprietor of Cheekpoint who had expanded a considerable sum of money on hotels and other accommodations, unless Parliament should take this loss into consideration\\". The decision by the British Government to grant the money to build the harbour at Dunmore East in 1814 spelt the end for the Cheekpoint enterprise and when the transfer of the mail packet took place in 1818 Cheekpoint ceased to have the passenger business which kept the village alive. The change from sail to steam meant that it would now be possible to run a service between Milford Haven and Ireland to a reasonable schedule and the new harbour at Dunmore East facilitated this greatly. Cheekpoint was then only used as a fishery harbour in the 19th and 20th centuries and became famous for a certain type of small fishing craft called the Cheekpoint Prong which was 17 ft.6in. long with a 4 ft.8in. beam and was normally rowed or paddled. They were used for long lining and salmon fishing with drift nets, snap nets and draft nets. In 1995 a series of groins (or groyne) were built up to 200 metres out in the river to divert the Cheekpoint Bar which was a mudbank impeding large vessels from travelling to the Port of Waterford. These groins resulted in the harbour at Cheekpoint silting up so badly that only small craft may now enter. The harbour is not used very often now by visiting craft because of this difficulty.

Albums Matthew van der Want's debut album, \\"Turn on You\\", was recorded in 1996 by Lloyd Ross of Shifty Records and released on the Tic Tic Bang record label in December. \\"Turn on You\\" featured several well- known South African musicians, including former African National Congress member of parliament, Jennifer Ferguson,http://www.ananziwomen.co.za/cgi- bin/ananziwomen/search.pl?id:1257005384 who performed on two duets on the album, and Tananas drummer Ian Herman. Two singles from Turn on You reached the 5FM National Top 40 and several of the tracks from the album received airplay in South Africa. In 1998 and 2002, van der Want collaborated with songwriter and composer Chris Letcher (now based in London) to release two albums. 1998's \\"low riding\\" was nominated in two categories in the South African Music Awards in the Best Rock album and Best Adult Contemporary categories. 2002's \\"bignity\\" was also nominated for Best Rock album in the 2002 South Africa Music Awards. Both albums were recorded by Lloyd Ross of Shifty Muic. The acoustic duo of van der Want and Letcher were critically acclaimed and they were repeatedly hailed as two of South Africa's top singer songwriters Bignity was listed in the Mail and Guardian's top ten albums of the decade (2000‚Äì2010) In 2002, van der Want produced a tribute album to South African Afrikanns alternative singer Koos Kombuis called \\"Kombuis Musiek\\". On that album, various South African singers performed songs authored by Koos Kombuis. van der Want released a further solo album in 2005, called \\"play my way\\". The single off that album reached no 6 in the 5FM South African Top 40. A best of album \\"the Best and Worst of Matthew van der Want\\" was released in 2008, containing various tracks from \\"Turn on You\\", \\"bignity\\", \\"low riding\\" and \\"play my way\\", as well as six previously unreleased tracks. In 2012, van der Want released a further solo album called 'Outstanding' through his own label, Bitchin' Pitchin'. While the album received positive reviews in the South African press, it received little attention from radio. Performance Van der Want performed at every Oppikoppi music festival between 1996 and 2005 and he and Chris Letcher recently made a return to South Africa's biggest music festival at the August 2011 Unknown Brother Festival. He performed at the Dranouter Folk music festival in Belgium in 1997 and at the WOMAD Festival in South Africa in 2001. van der Want has also performed several times at the Grahamstown National Arts Festival, his most recent performance being in July 2009. In 2008, van der Want participated in the Old Mutual Acoustic Encounters series at the Grahamstown National Arts Festival, collaborating with Harris Tweed (now Dear Reader)http://www.oldmutual.co.za/about-us/sponsorship/arts- and-lifestyle/acoustic-encounters/artists/matthew-van-der-want.aspx He has also played at the Splashy Fen Music Festival in 1996 and 1997. He was the support act for Lloyd Cole for his Johannesburg show in July 2006 at the Bassline in Newton, Johannesburg. Van der Want's live performance has been described as follows: \\"His cutting insights into matters of the heart, and satirical take on the music industry have probably made him a few enemies, but anyone with an ounce of self respect or taste should not be able to deny the talent behind the f*** off attitude. He says what he thinks, but he does so with such frightening beauty that you can't look away.\\"  Features elsewhere  Van der Want's music was featured in the documentary about the late James Phillips \\"Famous for not being famous\\" and his song \\"Pianist\\" was used in the 2010 movie \\"the Bang Bang Club\\" starring Ryan Phillipe. Three of his songs also featured on the 1996 album \\"New Africa Rock\\" The song \\"Turn on You\\" was featured on the album \\"My Generation\\" in 1996.

While stronger than 40-bit encryption, this still represents a relatively low level of security in the context of a brute force attack. Description The US government traditionally regulated encryption for reasons of national security, law enforcement and foreign policy. Encryption was regulated from 1976 by the Arms Export Control Act until control was transferred to the Department of Commerce in 1996. 56-bit refers to the size of a symmetric key used to encrypt data, with the number of unique possible permutations being 2^{56} (72,057,594,037,927,936). 56-bit encryption has its roots in DES, which was the official standard of the US National Bureau of Standards from 1976, and later also the RC5 algorithm. US government regulations required any users of stronger 56-bit symmetric keys to submit to key recovery through algorithms like CDMF or key escrow, effectively reducing the key strength to 40-bit, and thereby allowing organisations such as the NSA to brute-force this encryption. Furthermore, from 1996 software products exported from the United States were not permitted to use stronger than 56-bit encryption, requiring different software editions for the US and export markets. In 1999, US allowed 56-bit encryption to be exported without key escrow or any other key recovery requirements. The advent of commerce on the Internet and faster computers raised concerns about the security of electronic transactions initially with 40-bit, and subsequently also with 56-bit encryption. In February 1997, RSA Data Security ran a brute force competition with a $10,000 prize to demonstrate the weakness of 56-bit encryption; the contest was won four months later. In July 1998, a successful brute-force attack was demonstrated against 56-bit encryption with Deep Crack in just 56 hours. In 2000, all restrictions on key length were lifted, except for exports to embargoed countries. 56-bit DES encryption is now obsolete, having been replaced as a standard in 2002 by the 128-bit (and stronger) Advanced Encryption Standard. DES continues to be used as a symmetric cipher in combination with Kerberos because older products do not support newer ciphers like AES.https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3057154 See also *40-bit encryption *Pretty Good Privacy References Category:Symmetric-key cryptography Category:History of cryptography ","title":"56-bit encryption"},{"id":"33020836","text":"Agron Bajrami (born 18 December 1964 in Pristina, Kosovo, is editor of and a writer for Koha Ditore (English: Daily Time) newspaper, the largest daily newspaper in Kosovo.

It is located midway between, and within walking distance of, two of the most important population centres in East Sussex, Brighton and Lewes.  Geography  Whilst the top of Newmarket Hill is in the parish of Kingston near Lewes, its northern slopes are in the parish of Falmer, and its southern slopes are in the parish of Rottingdean. It is 200m (656 feet) high, and is the highest hill in the area, with a prominence of 105m. It has therefore been classified as a Hump. Like much of the Downs to the east of the River Adur the lack of a coastal plain has resulted in a strong maritime influence ‚Äì frequent salt laden winds ‚Äì which have helped maintain an open character to the hills. This has resulted in Newmarket Hill and the surrounding Downs being favoured for sheep grazing.  Geology  The geology of Newmarket Hill is that of a bedrock of upper chalk, partially overlain by clay-with-flints.  History  =Prehistory= In 1976 half of a polished Neolithic ceremonial axe head was found.Unpublished record in Brighton Museum. An ancient route passed over the hill from Brighton to Lewes which was presumed to have been used in Roman times. A small hoard of Roman coins is recorded as having been found adjacent to it on or near the hilltop (TQ363070). The route is known as Juggs Road (otherwise known as Juggs Lane, or Juggs Way), and is an example of an ancient ridgeway. It was named after the Brighton fishwives who transported their fish for the market in Lewes by donkey in either baskets or earthenware jugs. Jug or Jugg was a nickname for the Brighton fisherman.Sussex dialect =Military reviews and sham fights= When the Brighton Pavilion became a Royal residence in 1783, troops were stationed in Brighton. Large military reviews and sham fights for the spectacle of the general public were often held on the Downs beyond the Brighton Racecourse during the following 100 years. Newmarket Hill, the highest hill in its vicinity, is often mentioned as being involved in such mock battles. On one occasion in 1797, with the Prince of Wales in attendance on Newmarket Hill, a giant water-spout defeated the whole army and soaked the spectators. It was the exact shape of an inverted church steeple. In 1810, again with the Prince of Wales and many other individuals from high society in attendance, some 10,000 troops were watched by 30,000 spectators in the vicinity of Newmarket Hill. This was at a time when Brighton had a population of only about 10,000 people, and the nearby county town of Lewes, less than 3,000. With the later advent of railways, in 1862 19,000 troops were able to be involved in the Battle of White Hawk Down. One of the purposes of this exercise was to evaluate the use of rail transport as an aid for troop movements. The railway network successfully transported that day over 132,000 troops and other passengers for the occasion. Again, Newmarket Hill was a strategic point in this exercise. =John Dudeney= John Dudeney (his surname was pronounced like the word scrutiny) was one of Sussex's most famous shepherds. He tended the Kingston flock of 1,400 sheep on Newmarket Hill from 1799 to 1802. It was here that he dug himself a library out of the chalk for his books which he bought with money from catching wheatears and moles. By this means he taught himself astronomy, French, Latin, Hebrew, mathematics, and European history. Thus it was that he was soon able to become a school teacher in Lewes. =Newmarket Farm= In about 1830, at or shortly before the Kingston Enclosures, a farm labourers cottage and barn was built.Unpublished enclosures map of Kingston, 1830. Wiston Archive, West Sussex Record Office. It was: > \\"at the northern crest of the hill, a cattle fold, with barn and > outbuildings, and a cottage for a labourer to attend to the stock. The > cottage is an unusually substantial and comfortable house, built of flint > and surrounded by a little patch of garden land.\\" It was occupied for a little over a hundred years until its requisition in 1942 by the military authorities. All of the surrounding downland between Woodingdean and Kingston near Lewes was similarly requisitioned for military exercises, which resulted its destruction and subsequent demolition by the end of the war. In 1925 it was bought, along with the Balsdean and Norton farms to the south, by Brighton Corporation to prevent its previous owner, Oscar Selbach (father of the famous racing cyclist Maurice Selbach), from realising his property development plans. They wished to protect the Balsdean Valley watershed so it could provide drinking water for Brighton, and also for its amenity value. =Recent history=  Walks  There are many walks that have been described: * The South Downs Way ‚Äì Eastbourne, Newmarket Hill, Winchester ‚Äì 160 km (99 miles) * A walk to visit Newmarket Hill ‚Äì Lewes, Newmarket Hill, Balmer, Lewes ‚Äì 20.07 km * WalkingWorld.com ‚Äì Lewes, Breaky Bottom, Undercliff Walk, Brighton Marina ‚Äì 12 miles * Peter Lovett's ramblings ‚Äì Woodingdean, Balsdean, Newmarket Hill, Woodingdean ‚Äì 6 miles * Woodingdean Circular ‚Äì Woodingdean, Newmarket Hill, South Downs Way, Balsdean, Woodingdean ‚Äì 7 miles  References   External links  * Newmarket Hill: Exploring the natural and local history of the South Downs between Brighton and Lewes Category:Hills of East Sussex ","title":"Newmarket Hill, Sussex"},{"id":"33020894","text":"Elachista unifasciella is a moth of the family Elachistidae found in Asia and Europe.

The flowering period extends from June to August. The flowers are hermaphrodite and pollinated by insects (entomogamy). The fruit is a capsule. The seeds are dispersed by gravity alone (barochory). Distribution Gentiana cruciata is widespread in most of Europe (except Portugal, Great Britain and Scandinavia) and in Western Asia.Luirig Habitat This plant prefers dry calcareous soil in forest edges, bushy slopes, pastures, grasslands and dry meadows, at an altitude of above sea level. Host for Phengaris rebeli Phengaris rebeli is an endangered butterfly which feeds upon G. cruciata. Female P. rebeli lay their eggs on the upper side of G. cruciata leaves and three to four weeks later, the P. rebeli larvae emerge and begin to feed on the seeds and flowers of this grassland plant. After the P. rebeli reaches its fourth larval instar, it drops to the ground to be picked up by Myrmica schencki ants and brought to their nests. Female P. rebeli prefer to lay eggs on G. cruciata growing in clumps rather than individual plants, and on the taller plants, as they are less shaded and allow the eggs to grow and develop faster.

Life Bryant became interested in philosophy as a teenager, after struggling through personal turmoil. He received his Ph.D. from Loyola University in Chicago, Illinois, where he originally intended to study 'disclosedness' with the Heidegger scholar Thomas Sheehan. Bryant later changed his dissertation topic to the transcendental empiricism of Gilles Deleuze, with his analysis becoming the basis of his first book, Difference and Givenness: Deleuze's Transcendental Empiricism and the Ontology of Immanence, published in 2008. Philosophical work He was a member of the object-oriented philosophy movement and coined the term object-oriented ontology in 2009 to distinguish positions that are committed to the thesis that beings are composed of things from Graham Harman's object-oriented philosophy. His own version of object-oriented thought, called 'onticology', disprivileges human experience from a central position in metaphysical inquiry, while holding that objects are always split between two domains, virtuality and actuality. For Bryant, virtuality refers to the powers and potential of any given object, whereas actuality designates the qualities manifested by the actualization of an object's potential at any given point in time. Later Bryant, concerned with the doctrine of withdrawal and the non- relationism of object-oriented philosophy, departed from the object-oriented ontology movement and developed a machine-oriented ontology that argues being is composed entirely of machines or processes. =Onticology= Like other object-oriented ontologists, Bryant opposes the anthropocentrism of the Copernican Revolution proposed by Immanuel Kant, wherein objects are said to conform to the mind of the subject and, in turn, become products of human cognition. From Bryant's perspective, the Kantian contention that reality is inaccessible to human knowledge because it is structured by human cognition limits philosophy to a self-reflexive analysis of the mechanisms and institutions through which cognition structures reality. He states: To counter the form of post-Kantian epistemology, Bryant articulates an object-oriented philosophy called 'onticology', grounded in three principles. First, the Ontic Principle states that \\"there is no difference that does not make a difference.\\" Following from the premises that questions of difference precede epistemological interrogation and that to be is to produce differences, this principle posits that knowledge cannot be fixed prior to engagement with difference. Consequently, for Bryant, the thesis that things-in-themselves exist outside the boundaries of knowledge is untenable because it presupposes forms of being that make no differences. Similarly, concepts of difference predicated upon negation--that which objects are not or lack when placed in comparison with one another--are dismissed as arising only from the perspective of consciousness, rather than an ontological difference that affirms independent being. Second, the Principle of the Inhuman asserts that the concept of difference producing difference is not restricted to human, sociocultural, or epistemological domains, thereby marking the being of difference as independent of knowledge and consciousness. Humans exist as difference-making beings among other difference-making beings, therefore, without holding any special position with respect to other differences. Third, the Ontological Principle maintains that if there is no difference that does not also make a difference, then the making of difference is the minimal condition for the existence of being. In Bryant's words, \\"if a difference is made, then the being is.\\" Bryant further contends that differences produced by an object can be inter-ontic (made with respect to another object) or intra- ontic (pertaining the internal constitution of the object). Since onticology construes anything that produces differences--including fictions, signs, animals, and plants--as being equally real, albeit at different scales, it is what Manuel Delanda has called a \\"flat ontology.\\" Within an onticological framework, objects are composed of differences coalescing into a system that reproduces itself through time. Changes in the identity of an object are not changes in substance (defined by Bryant as \\"a particular state attained by difference\\"), however, but shifts in the qualities belonging to a substance. Qualities are the actualization of an object's inhered capacities or abilities, known as an object's powers. The actualization of an object's power into qualities or properties at a specific place and time is called local manifestation. Importantly, the occurrence of local manifestations does not require observation. In this way, qualities comprise actuality, referring to the actualization of an object's potential at a particular spatiotemporal location among a multitude of material differences, whereas powers constitute virtuality, or the potential retained by an object across time. As objects are distinct from local manifestations and one another, referred to as withdrawal, their being is defined by the relations forming their internal structure, or endo-relations, and retained powers. This withdrawn being is known as the virtual proper being of an object and denotes its enduring, unified substantiality. When relations external to an object, or exo-relations, consistently induce the same local manifestations to the extent that the actualization of qualities tends toward stability (for example, the sky remaining blue because of the constancy of Rayleigh scattering on atmospheric particles), the set of relations forms a regime of attraction. Onticology distinguishes between four different types of objects: Bright objects, dim objects, dark objects, and rogue objects. Bright objects are objects that strongly manifest themselves and heavily impact other objects, such as the ubiquity of cell phones in high-tech cultures. Dim objects lightly manifest themselves in an assemblage of objects; for example, a neutrino passing through solid matter without producing observable effects. Dark objects are objects that are so completely withdrawn that they produce no local manifestations and do not affect any other objects. Rogue objects are not chained to any given assemblage of objects, but instead wander in and out of assemblages, modifying relations within the assemblages into which they enter. Political protestors exemplify rogue objects by breaking with the norms and relations of a dominant political assemblage in order to forge new relations that challenge, change, or cast off the prior assemblage. Additionally, Bryant has proposed the concept of 'wilderness ontology' to explain the philosophical pluralization of agency away from human privilege. For Bryant, wilderness ontology alludes to the being of being, or common essence \\"characteristic of all entities and their relations to one another.\\" Resisting the traditional notion of wilderness that views civilization (the \\"inside\\" world of social relations, language, and norms) as separate from wilderness (the \\"outside\\" world of plants, animals, and nature), wilderness ontology argues that \\"wilderness\\" contains all forms of being, including civilization. Accordingly, the practice of wilderness ontology involves experiencing oneself as a being amongst, rather than above, other beings. In generalizing the agential alterity of being as a foundational ontological principle, Bryant posits three theses: First, wilderness ontology signals the absence of ontological hierarchy, such that all forms of being exist on equal footing with one another. Second, wilderness ontology rejects the topological bifurcation of nature and culture into discrete domains, instead holding that cultural assemblages are only one possible set of relations into which nonhuman entities may enter in the wilderness. Third, wilderness ontology extends agency to all entities, human and nonhuman, rather than casting nonhuman entities as passive recipients of human meaning projection. Employing these theses, Bryant pluralizes agential being beyond human finitude, contending that in so doing, the intentionality of the nonhuman world may be investigated without reference to human intent.

The wingspan is . Adults are on wing from June to August. The larvae feed on white wood-rush (Luzula luzuloides), hairy wood-rush (Luzula pilosa) and greater wood-rush (Luzula sylvatica). They mine the leaves of their host plant. At first, the larvae creates a narrow corridor which runs parallel to the leaf venation, although it may change direction two to three times. Later, this gallery abruptly changes into an elongate blotch, generally destroying the original gallery. Larvae may vacate the mine and restart elsewhere. Pupation takes place outside of the mine. They are pink with three cream- coloured length lines and a black head. Larvae can be found from autumn to April or June of the following year.

It was done by astrophysicists from the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Zurich, Switzerland and University of California, Santa Cruz. The simulation project was undertaken at the NASA Advanced Supercomputer Division's Pleiades and the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre for nearly eight months, which would have otherwise taken 570 years in a personal computer. The Eris simulation is the first successful detailed simulation of a Milky Way like galaxy. The results of the simulation were announced in August 2011. Background Simulation projects intending to simulate spiral galaxies have been undertaken for the past 20 years. All of these projects had failed as the simulation results showed central bulges which are huge compared to the disk size. Simulation The simulation was undertaken using supercomputers which include the Pleiades supercomputer, the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre and the supercomputers at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The simulation used 1.4 million processor-hours of the Pleiades supercomputer. It is based on the theory that in the early universe, cold and slow moving dark matter particles clumped together. These dark matter clumps then formed the \\"scaffolding\\" around galaxies and galactic clusters. The motions of more than 60 million particles which represented dark matter and galactic gas were simulated for a period of 13 billion years. The software platform Gasoline was used for the simulation. Simulation results The Eris simulation is the first successful simulation to have resolved the high-density gas clouds where stars formed. The simulation result consisted of a galaxy which is very similar to the Milky Way galaxy. Some of the parameters which were similar to Milky Way are stellar content, gas content, kinematic decomposition, brightness profile and the bulge-to-disk ratio.

Described as a \\"celebration of community, intimacy, exclusivity, rarity and physical artefact,\\" the album is not available in any physical form, and was performed seven times, throughout March 2010, on the condition that audience members record the album on whatever recording device they own. The List stated that, \\"King Creosote won‚Äôt release these songs commercially.

Plus it‚Äôll test whether copying music for free really does make for larger audiences.\\" Creosote elaborated further, \\"Since the release of Flick the Vs in April, I‚Äôve written ten new songs for an album that, for various reasons, I‚Äôd rather not record and release in the usual way. Instead I‚Äôve come up with this idea of a live album.

The unexpected thing when we first performed My Nth was the heightened concentration in the room. It was very powerful, a very charged atmosphere. No one talked or clapped. A few did cry.

Early life  Blackstone was born Fayetta June Hudson in Diller, Nebraska, in 1915. She self-taught herself to perform tricks on horses after watching a woman handle a flailing bronco when she was eight years old.  Career  Faye and Vic performed together throughout the United States during the 1940s and 1950s. She performed as far away from Nebraska as the Havana, Cuba, and competed alongside well known celebrities, including Gene Autry. She is credited with inventing three rodeo maneuvers, the reverse fender drag, the flyaway, and the ballerina. Vic Blackstone retired during the 1950s, while Faye Blackstone continued to perform until her retirement during the late 1960s. In 1978, Blackstone and her husband helped Reba McEntire, the daughter of friends, launch her career, by arranging for her to perform at a county fair in Florida. McEntire recalled the performance as a breakthrough in her career in a 2003 interview with the Bradenton Herald saying, \\"That was my first big fair by myself. It was huge to me.\\"  Personal life  In 1937, Blackstone married her husband, the Texan rodeo performer Vic Blackstone, in a ceremony held in the center of a rodeo arena in Bladen, Nebraska. The couple moved to a home on the outskirts of Parrish, Florida, in Manatee County during 1951. They worked and raised cattle at a nearby ranch. Death and legacy Faye Blackstone was elected into the Cowgirl Hall of Fame in 1982, the same year that her husband was inducted into the Rodeo Hall of Fame.

He was the director of the Museum of the Northern Dvina Culture (currently the Veliky Ustyug Museum of History, Art, and Architecture) from 1924 to 1938 and is credited with the preservation of most of historical and architectural heritage of the town of Veliky Ustyug. Biography Ice Drifting in Veliky Ustyug on the Sukhona River, 1923 Nikolay Bekryashev was born on in the village of Vyropaikha (present-day Dolgopolovskaya) near Krasnoborsk, Vologda Governorate of the Russian Empire to Maria Nikolayevna and Yegor Nikolayevich Bekryashev. He studied in the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint-Petersburg from 1900 to 1910. He specialized in genre painting. In 1918, the Northern Dvina Culture was open in Veliky Ustyug. The opening event was the exhibition of painting of Aleksandr Borisov. Yevlampy Burtsev was appointed the first director of the museum. After the death of Burtsev on 20 November 1924 Bekryashev became the museum director. From 1918, Bekryashev was at the center of the circle of local intellectuals in Veliky Ustyug, whose goal was to preserve the historical heritage of the town. On the opposite side, the authorities wished to close the churches, to confiscate the church property, and eventually to demolish the buildings. Bekryashev and his colleagues found a way to compromise with the authorities, so that the church property was confiscated, but declared to be the historical and cultural heritage, transferred to the museum and preserved there. The museum was initially located on the premises of Mikhaylo-Arkhangelsky Monastery in the center of the town. In 1921, Bekryashev managed to attract the commission from Moscow, which evaluated the Veliky Ustyg buildings and concluded on which of them represent the cultural heritage. He used the decisions of the committee against the local authorities which had no interest in keeping the buildings of former churches. In 1923, he initiated the creation of Northern Dvina Governorate Society of Regional Studies. The members of the Society, and Bekryashev in particular, personally toured the town in order to identify objects of cultural importance. As the result, Veliky Ustyug lost very little of its historical buildings and remained one of the best preserved architectural ensembles in Russia. Nikolay Bekryashev was arrested on 20 February 1938 during the Great Purge and sentenced to three years in prison for counter-revolutionary activity. He died on 6 April 1939 while still in a labor camp, near Plesetsk of Arkhangelsk Oblast. In 2000, he was posthumously awarded the title of an honorary citizen of Veliky Ustyug. The commemorative plaque to Nikolay Bekryashev is installed in the Veliky Ustyug Museum of History, Art, and Architecture.

In the 2011 season, Clark switched back to his original position in defence, as Fort played out a trophyless season for the first time since 2003. There was mounting speculation, fuelled by the player himself, that Clark might retire at the end of the season. This was confirmed in December 2011 due to fitness and work issues.

In Moonrunners, he was played by Bruce Atkins. The role of Rosco in the television series (and a much more detailed character than the one in Moonrunners) is the right-hand man of Hazzard County's corrupt county commissioner, Jefferson Davis \\"J.D.\\" Hogg (\\"Boss Hogg\\"); he was played by James Best, who had appeared in many films and TV series before landing the role. He appeared in all but five episodes. He was accompanied on the show by his character's pet/police dog (beginning in season 3), a basset hound named Flash.. Rosco's name is sometimes spelled with an E, which is incorrect; James Best corrected this popular misconception on his website. As in Moonrunners from which The Dukes of Hazzard TV series evolved, in the first season the character's name is given as \\"Rosco Coltrane\\". The initial \\"P.\\" was added from the start of the second season, after Best convinced show producers that it gave him more to play with vocally when pronouncing it. The \\"P.\\" stands for Purvis. Rosco in The Dukes of Hazzard = Early episodes= In early episodes, the character of Rosco was a serious one. He is depicted as a hard-nosed, focused, and aggressive sheriff, and actually shot a criminal (not fatally) in an early episode (\\"Mary Kaye's Baby\\", the third episode broadcast). He was a willing accomplice to Boss Hogg's schemes, and also appeared to have the ingenuity to arrange such schemes himself (in the pilot episode, \\"One Armed Bandits\\", for example, he seems to be the key organizer behind the illegal importation of slot machines into the county). The \\"One Armed Bandits\\" episode also explained that Rosco had served Hazzard County for 20 years as \\"a fairly honest lawman\\" but became embittered after his pension was wiped out following a failed bond referendum, and with just a few months left in office he was forced to run for re-election instead of retiring. This notion was explored again in a couple of other early episodes, most notably a scene where Deputy Enos asks him why he became so corrupt, in the fourth broadcast episode, \\"Repo Men\\". When series creator Gy Waldron realized that the series had become very popular with young children, the character was toned down to the more comedic and more bumbling persona for which he is best known, a characterization that Best himself largely created. He never wanted children viewing to feel afraid to approach a police officer when in need. =General information= Rosco frequently initiates car chases with Bo and Luke Duke (Hogg's most frequent adversaries), but the Duke boys are usually able to elude Rosco, who frequently wrecks his patrol car in various ways. Starting with the third season (1980‚Äì1981), Rosco got a pet dog‚Äîa lazy basset hound he calls \\"Flash\\" and nicknames \\"Velvet Ears\\"which he dotes on. Flash liked the Dukes but always barked at Boss Hogg. Early on, the dog's gender was male, but this would change in later episodes. Boss Hogg and Rosco are brothers-in-law because Rosco's older sister, Lulu, is married to Boss Hogg. Rosco has just more than $43 in his savings account, and often tries to join Boss in indulging in high-calorie dishes (which usually results in him getting his hands slapped). His patrol car (in the first season a 1974 Dodge Monaco or a 1970 Dodge Polara (first two episodes), 1974‚Äì5 AMC Matador, and 1976 Plymouth Fury. In later seasons a 1977 or 1978 Dodge Monaco or Plymouth Fury) which also serves as his daily driver except for a few episodes where he has other cars, such as a 1977 Pontiac Lemans in the 3rd season episode \\"To Catch a Duke\\" which he apparently saved his nickels and dimes for, as he claims. This car can routinely be seen parked outside the Police station in stock footage exterior shots for the rest of the series. His personal vehicle in the 5th-season episode \\"The Revenge of Hughie Hogg\\" is a 1967‚Äì1968 Chevrolet Impala which he kicks apart. Rosco carries a pearl-handled Smith & Wesson Model 15 (a Smith & Wesson Model 10 in the pilot episode, and also the opening credits for the show), with which he is an expert shot, although when he has to use it in the line of duty, he gets too nervous to hit anything (the exception being the first-season episode, \\"Mary Kaye's Baby\\" when he shot a criminal in a shoot out). His main deputies‚Äîwhom he often calls \\"dipstick\\"‚Äîinclude Enos Strate and Cletus Hogg. Although he often henpecks and belittles his deputies, he also shows great concern when they might be in real danger. Rosco's mentality is that of a clumsy, somewhat slow-witted buffoon. He speaks often with a childish vernacular and repeats his favorite catchphrases constantly. One that has always been featured when Rosco arrests the Duke boys or anyone else for that matter is \\"Cuff 'em and stuff 'em!\\" One aspect of Rosco's personality that was well-loved and became synonymous with him was a choppy and excited chuckle that was produced from the back of the throat (\\"Kew-kew-kew-kew!\\") and became one of the most recognizable aspects of the character (a clip of this laugh was played over the closing Warner Bros. Television logo on the end credits for most episodes, though it sometimes alternated with a clip of Boss Hogg yelling \\"Them Dukes, them Dukes!\\"). He is easily excitable and genuinely enjoys law enforcement, especially chasing criminals, which he refers to as \\"hot pursuit\\". Rosco was married briefly in an episode, \\"Mrs. Rosco P. Coltrane\\", during the third season (1980‚Äì1981), to a woman he purportedly met through a computer dating service, but the marriage was a sham‚Äîhis \\"bride\\" robbed banks with her husband and his associate ‚Äî and the union was quickly annulled. This episode was also the only episode to feature Rosco's mother, and the only episode to reveal that the initial 'P' stood for Purvis. Rosco has shown on numerous occasions (especially on episodes where characters either were thought to have died or found themselves in serious trouble) that he is much more of a caring man than he ordinarily lets on. This is particularly clear when the safety of his best friend Boss Hogg is threatened by somebody. During the second season (1979‚Äì1980) of the series, James Best left over a dispute about the changing-room conditions. His gripe was that he did not mind getting soaked or covered in mud when filming Rosco crashing his car into rivers and such, but was unhappy with the poor changing facilities afterwards. During his absence, Rosco was replaced by a number of stand-in sheriffs (played by such actors as James Hampton and Dick Sargent). Eventually the dispute was settled, and Best returned as Rosco, remaining for the rest of the show's run. Following the death of actor Sorrell Booke who played Boss Hogg, the first reunion film also showed that Boss Hogg had died. Rosco inherited his money (and documents of dirty schemes) and he also became Hazzard County's Commissioner as well as serving as Sheriff. Rosco P. Coltrane in film *The character originated in the 1975 film Moonrunners and was played by Bruce Atkins. This film was the precursor to The Dukes of Hazzard. Although more of a secondary character in this movie, the role was a more serious version of Rosco, with mention of going crooked because the county took away his pension (something that was mentioned in early episodes of The Dukes). *M.C. Gainey portrayed Rosco in the 2005 film The Dukes of Hazzard. Gainey's Rosco did not incorporate the childlike qualities of Best's interpretation or the prominent middle initial P; the character was portrayed as a much more serious, wicked sheriff who genuinely detested the Dukes. *Harland Williams played Rosco in The Dukes of Hazzard: The Beginning. His portrayal was much more in line with Best's bumbling portrayal from the TV series. This version of Rosco was said to have been married, and was lodging with Boss Hogg and Lulu, after his wife had thrown him out. See also *J.W. Pepper *Buford T.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. History With the planned opening of the Soo Locks in 1855, it was anticipated that shipping traffic in Lake Superior would dramatically increase. Thus, in 1853, Congress appropriated money to locate a lighthouse on the northern end of Grand Island. A site atop a cliff was chosen for the light, and construction commenced in 1856 on the first lighthouse located here; the light was put into service with a fourth-order Fresnel lens later that year. However, due to the poor quality of materials used in construction, the condition of the building deteriorated rapidly, and by 1865 the light was judged to be in \\"wretched condition.\\" A replacement was recommended, and Congress appropriated more money the following year. In 1867, the second Grand Island North Light Station was built. This was before the founding of nearby Munising, or indeed the before the establishment of the surrounding county of Alger. The light house was built of brick, using standard plans provided by the U.S. Lighthouse Establishment. The lens was transferred from the old tower, and the light was put into service the same year. A keeper and an assistant were stationed at the lighthouse; over the years a few minor changes were made to the boathouse location and associated stairs. In 1941, the lamp was automated and the station was boarded up and abandoned. In 1961, a 12-volt electrical system was installed on a pole near the cliff, the earlier light was decommissioned, and the Fresnel lens removed. The station, now surplus, was sold to Loren Graham. Restoration work was done in 1972 - 1973. The lighthouse and associated buildings are currently used as a private summer home. Description The Grand Island North Light Station is a two-story building constructed of brick in a rectangular plan. A three-story, light tower and a one-story kitchen addition are attached to the station. The station has a tin-covered gable roof supported by queen-post trusses. The exterior is painted in the original colors of yellow, white, and black, and the station as a whole looks substantially as it did when built. The tower once housed a fourth-order Fresnal lens. Four other buildings are located on the site: a tool shed, fuel storage shed, and outhouse (all made of brick); and a wooden well-house.

(10 September 1775 ‚Äì 12 December 1849), anglicized as John Anthony Grassi, was an Italian Catholic priest and Jesuit who led many academic and religious institutions in Europe and the United States. Born in Schilpario in the Republic of Venice, Grassi studied in Bergamo and Colorno, where he entered the Society of Jesus. Because the Society was suppressed by the pope, he completed his education at the Jesuit College in Po≈Çock, as the Jesuits were allowed to operate in the Russian Empire. He proved to be an excellent student of the natural sciences, especially mathematics and astronomy, in which he would later engage in research, and was appointed rector of the college's Institute for Nobles. In 1805, the Jesuit Superior General directed Grassi to go to Peking to replace the last remaining Jesuit missionary in China. This set off for Grassi and two other Jesuits a journey across Europe that would last five years, during which they spent time in London and Lisbon, but never reached China. Grassi ended up teaching and studying at the University of Coimbra, before being transferred to Stonyhurst College in England, where he taught for several years and also studied at the Royal Institution. Grassi was then sent by the General in 1810 to the United States, where he was to teach at Georgetown College in Washington, D.C. He was eventually appointed superior of the Jesuits' Maryland Mission and president of the College in 1812, where he significantly improved its curriculum, enrollment, and public reputation. Grassi also obtained its congressional charter, which officially recognized the institution as a university. Due to his substantial improvement of the college, Grassi became known as Georgetown's \\"second founder.\\" His tenure came to an end in 1817, when Archbishop Leonard Neale sent him as his representative to the Propaganda Fide. Grassi never returned to the United States. Rather, he moved to Turin, becoming the rector of the College of Nobles for ten years. He also became a close confidant to the monarchs of the House of Savoy, as well as provincial superior of the Jesuits' Turin Province. In 1835, he was transferred to Rome, where he became rector of the Pontifico Collegio Urbano de Propaganda Fide and later the Superior General's assistant for Italy. Early life and education Giovanni Antonio Grassi was born on 10 September 1775 in Schilpario, Lombardy, in the Republic of Venice. He studied under the Somaschi Fathers, before going to the diocesan seminary of Bergamo, where he studied theology for two years and was ordained a priest. Grassi then entered the Society of Jesus, which at the time was officially suppressed by the pope. He proceeded to the Jesuit novitiate in Colorno, on 21 November 1799, becoming one of the novitiate's first students. alt=Entrance of the Jesuit College in Po≈Çock Due to the nearly worldwide suppression of the Jesuit order, the novices at Colorno were allowed only to pronounce their simple vows. Therefore, Grassi advanced to the Jesuit College in Po≈Çock (in present-day Belarus) in 1801 to complete his priestly education, while the master of novices of the Colorno novitiate, Joseph Pignatelli, assured him that he would eventually return to Italy. Because Empress Catherine the Great declined to suppress the Jesuits, the order fled Western Europe and survived in the Russian Empire, with Po≈Çock becoming the order's center. Grassi proved to be an excellent student in the natural sciences, and he completed his theological studies there in 1804. He then became the rector of the college's Institute for Nobles and a teacher of higher mathematics. = European voyage = Upon the completion of his education, Grassi began preparing for an assignment to minister to Armenians in Astrakhan, and was studying Armenian. However, he and two others were soon summoned by the Jesuit Superior General, Gabriel Gruber, to St. Petersburg. On their arrival on 19 January 1805, he informed them that they would be sent to replace the one remaining Jesuit missionary in China, Louis Antoine de Poirot. The Superior General determined that it would be preferable for the missionaries to travel to Peking by sea, rather than by the overland route that a departing Russian delegation was taking, since all previous missions entered through those cities. The General outfitted them with new vestments and chalices for celebrating Mass, mathematical and scientific instruments, medicines, furs for the winter, and gifts to give to the people. Therefore, the trio departed by sled for Sweden, accompanied by a Swedish interpreter. They set out for London, where the Superior General arranged for a ship to take them to Canton. Shortly after departing, three of the party fell ill, including Grassi, and they stopped for ten days at a small town on the Russian‚ÄìSwedish border, where they were attended by a doctor. They eventually reached Stockholm, Sweden on 22 March. On their arrival, the Russian minister to Sweden informed them that the British would not permit them to sail out of London. Therefore, the party instead left for Copenhagen, seeking to sail from there. They soon discovered that there were no ships that could take them to Canton, and spent a month in Copenhagen waiting for the next ship leaving for London. Their voyage was delayed by a severe storm, but they eventually reached London on 25 May. On their arrival, however, they discovered that no ships would take them to Peking. With the help of the English Jesuits, they obtained the intervention of Lord George Macartney, the former British ambassador to China, who unsuccessfully attempted to convince the directors of the East India Company to allow the Jesuits to travel on their vessels. alt=Front facade of Stonyhurst College Therefore, the party set sail for Lisbon, Portugal, where they believed they could secure passage to Macau. Their journey was delayed when the captain stopped in Cork, Ireland; they eventually reached Lisbon on 28 September. The papal nuncio to Portugal informed them that due to the Portuguese persecution of the Jesuits under the Marquis of Pombal, they would not be permitted to board a Portuguese vessel without written approval from the pope. They also studied astronomy under Count Damoiseau de Montfort. In March 1806, the three were informed that the Propaganda Fide in Rome had become uneasy about their mission to China. Realizing that they would be in Portugal for considerably longer, they went to the University of Coimbra in April, where they studied for two months. Grassi then began tutoring the eldest son of Count Arcos in mathematics. Due to an escalation of the persecution of Christians in China, the Superior General finally decided that he would no longer permit their mission. On 23 September 1807, he ordered them to go to Stonyhurst College in Lancashire, England, and await further instruction. The voyage lasted for 40 days, because the ship had to circumvent the French fleet invading Portugal, causing the ship to run out of food and almost run out of water. Finally, they arrived in Liverpool on 16 November 1807, and at Stonyhurst College on 21 December 1807. At the college, Grassi taught Italian and Latin, while also studying calculus and astronomy. He also studied mathematics and astronomy in London, including at the Royal Institution.  American missionary  In 1810, the Superior General, Tadeusz Brzozowski, ordered Grassi to go to the United States. He set sail from Liverpool on 27 August, and landed in Baltimore, Maryland, on 20 October. He met with John Carroll, the Archbishop of Baltimore, and proceeded to Georgetown College in Washington, D.C. He found Baltimore \\"completely deserted,\\" contrary to what a map of the city suggested; Washington was an even greater contrast to the cities of Europe he was used to, describing it as \\"not even one-eighth...built up\\" and the Capitol unfinished. He also discovered the country was largely hostile to Catholics and especially distrustful of the Jesuits. Grassi applied for American citizenship immediately upon arriving, and became a naturalized citizen on 27 December 1815. By the time he arrived at Georgetown, enrollment had dropped precipitously and the college operated on a significant deficit. In his first year, he taught Italian and Spanish. = Presidency of Georgetown College = Grassi was appointed the president of Georgetown College on 1 October 1812, succeeding Francis Neale. He was also appointed by the Superior General as the superior of the Jesuits' Maryland Mission, to succeed Charles Neale. Due to the Napoleonic Wars, the letter of his appointment did not reach Washington until June, and he assumed office on 15 August. John Caroll informed Grassi that the Superior General did not have authority to appoint Grassi as president and rector, as Georgetown College was not owned by the Jesuit order itself but by the Corporation of Roman Catholic Clergymen; indeed, Grassi was the first president who had not been elected by the board of directors or appointed by Carroll. Nonetheless, Carroll did not oppose Grassi's assumption of leadership, and the board unanimously elected Grassi, but did not confer on him all the powers normally associated with the office. The following year, he went to St. Inigoes, Maryland, to complete his retreat prior to pronouncing his final vows, where he contracted a fever that lasted for a year. alt=Campus of Georgetown College in 1828 Grassi instituted a significant reform of the faculty and curriculum, hiring talented faculty and firing those who were inferior. He also improved discipline among the students. The number of subjects taught at the college increased, and the number of enrolled students increased four-fold. During his presidency, he continued to teach algebra, mensuration, and arithmetic. He also instructed students in astronomy, using instruments he had brought from Stonyhurst. Grassi made by his own hand or had a Jesuit brother make wooden orreries (since the college did not have money to purchase brass ones) for displaying the motion of the planets, as well as other apparatuses to demonstrate principles of mechanics or hydraulics. He also established a museum, that housed these devices among items, which drew members of the public, including senators and congressmen. Upon request, Grassi used these instruments to calculate longitude of Washington, D.C. and the timing of eclipses. Grassi also oversaw Georgetown during the British burning of Washington in the War of 1812. He maintained good relations with the Russian ambassador to the United States, Andrey Yakovlevich Dashkov, who frequently visited the college, as well as with the American political leaders. Though he opposed what he viewed as unbridled freedom in the United States, he approved that it was conducive to free religious practice, which was banned by some of Europe's civil governments. He criticized slavery in the United States as being inconsistent with a national spirit of liberty, and considered it the country's greatest flaw; however, he wrote of how the material conditions of some slaves were superior to those of Europe's peasantry, and regarded immediate, universal emancipation as too dangerous. Following the papal restoration of the Society of Jesus in 1814, Grassi negotiated a concordat with Carroll's successor, Leonard Neale, regarding the division of parishes in the United States between the Jesuits and the secular clergy. He also utilized the fact that the sons of several members of Congress were students at Georgetown by obtaining through the assistance of William Gaston (a Georgetown alumnus and the only Catholic member of Congress) a congressional charter for Georgetown College on 1 March 1815, which raised the institution to university status. In Archbishop Carroll's estimation, Grassi had \\"revived the College of Ge-Town, which [had] received great improvement in the number of students and course of studies.\\" For this, Grassi has been described as Georgetown's \\"second founder.\\" With this great number of students came an increase in both the religious and ethnic the diversity of students, including more Protestant, French and Irish students. Overall, this led to an increase in the public reputation of Georgetown. His presidency came to an end on 28 June 1817, and he was succeeded by Benedict Joseph Fenwick. His term as superior of the Maryland Mission also ended, where he was replaced by Anthony Kohlmann on 10 September.  Return to Europe  = Representative to the Propaganda Fide = In July 1817, Leonard Neale tasked Grassi with going to Rome to persuade the Propaganda Fide to reverse a previous order to reinstate several priests in Charlestown, Maryland, whom Neale had removed from ministry due to a conflict over Russian Jesuits' involvement in the Jesuit plantations in White Marsh. Despite the calls of Peter Kenney, the visitor to the United States on behalf of the Superior General, to return Grassi to Georgetown, he would remain in Europe for the rest of his life. His removal from the United States was lamented by many of the ecclesiastical superiors, including one Bishop Benedict Joseph Flaget, who had proposed Grassi to become the Bishop of Detroit. Notwithstanding initial instructions to return to the United States, Grassi remained in Italy, as his physicians told him that he would not survive a voyage across the Atlantic due to a hernia. While in Rome, he also successfully argued before the Propaganda Fide for the full canonical restoration of the Jesuit order in England. = Confessor and provincial superior = Grassi became the (assistant) to the Jesuit provincial superior of Italy and procurator of the Italian province. On 17 November 1821, he became the rector of the College of Nobles in Turin, a position he held until 1831. He later was also rector of the college in Naples. Grassi then moved to Turin, where he developed a relationship with the House of Savoy, and was appointed the confessor to King Charles Felix and Queen Maria Cristiana of Sardinia. His closeness with the royal family was such that King Charles frequently sought Grassi's advice, and died in his arms. He also was acquainted with Charles' successor, King Charles Albert, who Grassi had assisted in ascending to the throne. Grassi continued to serve as confessor to Maria Christina, for a total of 25 years. On 10 May 1831, he was appointed the provincial superior of the Jesuits' Province of Turin, and rector of the College of the Holy Martyrs. Eventually, Grassi was called to Rome by the Superior General in 1835, and he was made rector of the Pontificio Collegio Urbano de Propaganda Fide in 1840, replacing Liberio Figari. He held this position for two years, and was succeeded by Giovanni Batta Dessi. He then served as the assistant to the Superior General for Italy from 1842 to 1849, and was the archivist of the Jesuit generalate house in Rome. Grassi died on 12 December 1849 in the house of Cardinal Angelo Mai in Rome.

It was opened in 1859 by the Cologne- Minden Railway Company with the Sieg Railway and served passenger and freight traffic. Station building  The Station building The original station building opened in 1859 was destroyed in World War II. The current station building was opened by Deutsche Bundesbahn in 1962. The building stood empty for several years and in the meantime could not be used by passengers. Since February 2009, a bakery outlet has occupied the former ticket hall. Next to the station there is a parking station and a parking lot for park and ride commuters. Platforms  Until spring 2004, the station had a platform next to the entrance building and a platform between tracks 1 and 2, which could only be reached at ground level over track 1. Therefore, only one train at a time was allowed to stop at Eitorf and to prevent two trains crossing at the station, one train had to wait outside the station for the departure of the other. Since the renovation of the station the side platform is now on the other side of track 2. Ramps have also been installed to give barrier-free access to the platforms for the disabled. The platforms have a height of 76 centimetres, which means that there is no access for wheelchair to the Rhine- Ruhr S-Bahn trains (which have an entrance height of 96 centimetres) without assistance; such assistance is available. Train services The station is served by the Rhein-Sieg-Express (RE 9) every hour. It is also served by S-Bahn S 12 services from K√∂ln-Ehrenfeld (Horrem in the peak) to Au (Sieg) and S19 services on weekdays from D√ºren to Herchen or Au (Sieg). The S12 services operate hourly, but the S19 services are less frequent. In the morning peak, two extra RE 9 services run to Cologne and in the afternoon peak two extra RE 9 services run to Siegen. Freight trains rarely operate through the station. All passenger trains running through the station are operated by DB Regio Rheinland. The station is classified by Deutsche Bahn since January 2011 as a category 5 station.

He runs a small Summerton, South Carolina United States based design company that has designed a number of popular courses in Portugal, Scotland, France, Venezuela, Columbia and the Caribbean, as well as numerous American links. He was owner and operator of Canongate Golf Clubs, a set of private golf courses in the Atlanta area, known for quality golf at an affordable price, before being bought by Sequoia Golf LLC. and later ClubCorp.  History  Roquemore grew up in Lakeland, Georgia. He graduated from Lanier County High School in 1966 where he was an honor student, outstanding athlete, and president of the student body. His great grandfather Robert L. Patten founded Patten Seed Company in 1901. In the 1950s, the company became the first commercial producer of turf quality hybrid Bermuda grasses. The first users were golf courses in the Deep South. Roquemore was appointed to the U S Air Force and served (by his own admission) as a very undistinguished cadet, and leaving after only two years. He then attended the Georgia Institute of Technology, preparing himself for a career in golf design. He was hired in 1969 as an associate of Joe Lee. Roquemore's first assignment under Lee, was onsite supervisor for the construction of the first three golf courses at Walt Disney World. In 1974 Lee Made him a partner in the firm. During the partnership, the two designed and renovated over 100 golf courses. Two of those were chosen as best new course by Golf Digest Magazine, and several other were in the top ten. Other courses have been highly ranked in the US and abroad.  Canongate Golf Clubs  Roquemore's great grandfather Robert L. Patten founded Patten Seed Company in 1901, and in the 1950s, the company became the first commercial producer of turf quality hybrid Bermuda grasses. Golf courses in the south became interested in the product, and the demand for the hybrid grass skyrocketed. Bill Roquemore, Rocky' father, changed the name of the Patten Seed Co. to Canongate Golf Clubs, a name people would associate better with the golf business. Golf courses were being built all over the south, and the demand for them was through the roof. The Roquemore family, including Rocky have designed approximately 174 courses, and have operated around 20 of them in the Atlanta area, under the Canongate Golf Clubs name. Canongate proved to be one of the more profitable multi course companies and was sold to larger operator Sequoia Golf, who was bought in 2014 by larger company ClubCorp. His family built their first course, Canongate 1 Golf Club in 1965, which was designed by Dick Wilson and Joseph L. Lee, which he would later intern with a few years later. In 1999, Roquemore, along with Jeff Burton, designed and added 18 more holes to the course, making it a 36-hole golf course. The course is now owned and operated by ClubCorp, the world's leader private clubs. After Completing Canongate 1, Roquemore began to build his private club empire buy purchasing White Oak Golf Club in Newnan, Georgia, and by opening several courses in the Peachtree City, Georgia area, as well as in Atlanta, Georgia.  Awards and Accomplishments  The Roquemores were chosen by the National Golf Foundation as the Jack Nicklaus Golf Family of the year in 1995, and Patten Seed Company, the Georgia Family Business of the Century in 2005. Roquemore was a director of The Georgia State Golf Association and was instrumental in bringing daily fees, municipal courses, and for bringing women into the association. His sister, Lee Burton Roquemore, followed as the first female director of the association. Roquemore has served on the boards of directors of several organizations with a focus on not for profit. He has also designed and donated to public parks in Lakeland, Ga.  List of Courses Designed  The Roquemore family together had designed and built over 174 courses across the world, and has owned and operated about 23 of them.

They play a style of post-metal which is heavily influenced by the Swedish extreme metal band Meshuggah. The band blends polyrhythmic passages and extremely low tunings with a heavily layered production style and ambient soundscapes. They are often categorized in the djent movement due to the Meshuggah-like guitar tone they often employ. The band was formed after the split of Longchat, a band which featured Igor Omodei and Benoit Friedrich. History The band released an EP entitled 8 in 2009, which is available as a free download in its entirety from the band's official website. The EP is made up entirely of riffs discarded from the full length they were working on at the time (which became Februus) pieced together and arranged into songs. The vocals were provided by Daniel √Ñdel of the Swedish band Vildhjarta. The band stated that it was put together to show that they could release something, as Februus was taking a long time to write and record. On May 11, 2011, they signed to Basick Records. They embarked on their first ever tour in September 2011, touring the UK with Chimp Spanner and TesseracT. Their first full-length release, Februus, came out October 31, 2011 and received overwhelmingly positive reviews.http://www.basickrecords.com/news/article/162http://www.holdtightpr.com/news/article/uneven- structure-to-release-debut-album-februus-in-october Shortly after, drummer Christian Schreil departed from the band to form Means End together with former Vildhjarta vocalist Robert Luciani. With the Euroblast 7 festival approaching, Mike Malyan of the British band Monuments generously acted as a stand in drummer until Jean Ferry joined Uneven Structure in late 2011. The band began to play live shows again from late 2011 onwards, supporting Protest the Hero, Textures and TesseracT on their respective tours. They also played at the Basick records showcase at Camden Barfly with label mates Chimp Spanner and The Algorithm. Two videos were uploaded to Uneven Structure's YouTube account which contained clips of new material, suggesting that a new release was in the works. The band later confirmed this via their Facebook page, stating that the album's concept had been decided and that the writing process was in progress. In 2013, a re-recorded version of their debut EP 8 was released, as a stopgap release to tide fans over until the completion of their second album. July 21, 2015 was released the first single \\"Funambule\\" from the new album \\"La Partition\\", through Basick Records. It was not until February 24, 2017 that the second single \\"Incube\\" was released, this time through Long Branch Records. \\"La Partition\\" in full was released April 21 of the same year while the band was touring Europe supporting Twelve Foot Ninja. The band toured extensively through 2017 and 2018. Uneven Structure released their third full-length album \\"Paragon\\" on October 18, 2019. The first single \\"Innocent\\" premiered on July 25, 2019, accompanied by a music video directed by guitarist Igor Omodei.

Governor Blair Lee III, became acting governor following the departure of Governor Marvin Mandel. Biography =Early life= Lee was born Mathilde Boal on May 1, 1920, in Washington, D.C. She was named for her paternal grandmother, a distant relative of Christopher Columbus. Her mother, Jeanne de Menthon, a native of France, was a descendant of the 11th century French saint, Bernard of Menthon. Lee's father, Pierre de Lagarde Boal, was an American diplomat who served as the United States' ambassador to Nicaragua and Bolivia during the 1940s. Boal, who was fluent in English, French and Spanish, lived in ten countries by the time she completed college. Boal graduated from Elmwood School, an exclusive all-girls school in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, where her father was stationed for a diplomatic post. She obtained a bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1943, graduating cum laude from Bryn Mawr College in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. Boal took a job as a chemist with the Rockefeller Foundation in Colombia after graduating from Bryn Mawr College. She soon became engaged to Francis Preston Blair Lee III, a naval officer during World War II, whom she married in 1944. The two families, the Lees and the Boals, had previously been close friends even before the marriage. The couple had eight children. =First Lady of Maryland= Blair Lee III was sworn in as Lieutenant Governor of Maryland in 1971 and became acting Governor in 1977 when Governor Marvin Mandel was charged with racketeering and stepped down on an interim basis. As Maryland's First Lady, Lee took on an unusually independent approach from her predecessors. Lee did not move to the Government House in Annapolis instead choosing to live with her children full-time at their home and farm in Silver Spring, Maryland. When speaking to the Baltimore Sun upon taking office in 1978, Governor Lee said of his wife, \\"Where I go, she goes. At least that's what I keep telling myself anyway. She would rather be canoeing on the Potomac, backpacking along the Appalachian Trail or teaching children to swim than preparing for a formal party.\\" One of Lee's predecessors, former First Lady Barbara Mandel, publicly offered to act as a \\"sort of senior adviser\\" to Lee explaining the need of First Ladies to engage in ceremonies, such as ribbon cuttings and garden tours. Lee privately and publicly disliked much of the ceremonial roles of a traditional First Lady, like the ribbon cuttings, and the practice of politics, which she called \\"frivolous.\\" Political columnist Frank DeFilippo, who served as press secretary for Governor Mandel, said of Lee, \\"I normally eschew the overused word 'unique,' but Mimi truly was. I've covered first ladies going back to Avalynne Tawes, and Mimi was the only one of the bunch who truly loathed life in the mansion, which, when forced to be there, she roamed in Sunny's Surplus fatigues with cargo pockets.\\" Lee compared the formal role of First Lady, which she called \\"pomp,\\" to social functions held at U.S. embassies when she was a girl. In a 1977 article, the Washington Post took note of the unusual outlook of the new First Lady, \\"She disdains luncheons and fashion shows except for her favorite causes ‚Äî the Red Cross, water safety and Holy Cross Hospital among others. And while some other women from ordinary backgrounds would revel in the new status, Mimi Lee admits that sometimes it's inconvenient.\\" The Washington Post also noted that she \\"answers her own phone, vacuums her house, cooks for her guests.\\" In 1977, she told the Washington Post she wanted to \\"throw up\\" whenever her family was described as an \\"aristocracy.\\" While Lee limited her time in the state capitol, she partook in her state duties when necessary. Even in Annapolis, Lee preferred sneakers, jeans and work skirts to more formal attire. She once expressed irritation at the cancellation of a white water rafting trip on the Shenandoah River, but later told the Washington Post in the late 1970s that she had a \\"lovely\\" time hosting The Princess Anne. Lee focused much of her official time as First Lady on volunteer functions, such as the March of Dimes or the Red Cross. An accomplished athlete, Lee taught swimming classes for the handicapped while in office. She held an annual \\"Beer Bash\\" for Maryland Democrats at her farm in Silver Spring, often cooking for the guests. Governor Blair Lee ran for a full term as governor in 1978, but was defeated in the Democratic gubernatorial primary by Harry Hughes. The Lees left office in January 1979, shortly before the end of his term, when Governor Mendel reclaimed his office for the two remaining days. =Later life= Her husband, Blair Lee, died in 1985. Lee devoted much of the rest of her life to athletic and philanthropic pursuits. Lee was an avid outdoor enthusiast throughout her life, pursuing skiing, canoeing, and camping. She became a practitioner of yoga during her tenure as First Lady and continued her athletic interests during her later life, becoming a competitive Senior athlete in swimming. An accomplished Senior Olympian, Lee broke numerous national and Maryland swimming records while competing in the Senior Olympics during the 1990s. Lee also competed in the U.S. Masters Swimming Nationals, winning eight swimming competitions throughout the United States, and placed second in twenty other races. She hiked the Pyrenees between France and Spain with two of her seventeen-year-old grandchildren when she was seventy years old. Outside of swimming, Lee learned German during her 80s. Mimi Lee died of congestive heart failure at Laurel Regional Hospital in Laurel, Maryland, on August 9, 2011, at the age of 91. She was survived by seven of her eight children ‚Äì Blair Lee IV, Joseph W. Lee, Christopher G. Lee, Erica B. Lee, Philip L. Lee, John F. Lee and Jenny Sataloff; her sister, Mary Elizabeth d'Harcourt; nineteen grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. Another son, Pierre B. Lee, died in 1973. Lee's funeral Mass was held at her parish, St. John the Baptist Catholic Church, in Silver Spring.

Jaeck started his playing career with Basel. A well-documented curiosity was that at the end of Basel's 1929‚Äì30 season, the team set off on a Scandinavian football tour, including a visit to Germany. Six games were played in Norway, but the first was played in Leipzig. The team travelled with 15 players, their trainer Kert√©sz and two functionaries. The journey started with a train ride on 2 June 1930 at quarter past seven in the morning from Basel and they arrived in Leipzig at half passed eight that evening. The game against VfB Leipzig was played the next evening. The following one and a half days were spent travelling by train, train, ship, train and train again to Drammen in Norway. Only a few hours after their arrival, the team played a game against a joint team Mj√∏ndalen IF / SBK Drafn. The next day was a train journey to Porsgrunn and two matches in 24 hours. Following that they travelled per bus and then by ship in a 48-hour journey to Bergen for a match against SK Brann. Another ship voyage, this time to Stavanger, two games against Viking FK, then a ship voyage back to Bergen. Finally, the tour ended with three train journeys in three days, Bergen/Oslo/Berlin/Basel, arriving at home on 20 June. The result of this tour was seven games, four wins, one draw, two defeats and approximately 160 hours of travelling. Jaeck was participant in this tour. He played in six games and scored four goals. Jaeck then played two seasons for Servette and returned to his home club Basel in 1932 for four years. He was member of the Basel team that won the Swiss Cup in the 1932‚Äì33 season. The final was played in the Hardturm stadium against Grasshopper Club. Basel won 4‚Äì3 and thus the club's first ever national title. Jaeck then moved to France. He spent the season 1936‚Äì37 with French first division side Olympique Lillois, followed by a further two seasons with Mulhouse. He returned to his home country in 1939 and finished his career with home club Basel for whom he scored a total of 73 goals in 170 appearances. Between 1931 and 1936, he represented Switzerland 28 times at international level, scoring twice, and was part of Switzerland's 1934 FIFA World Cup squad. In August 1953 Jaeck suffered a heavy car accident and he died due to the consequences.

Flemming then had to go overseas to London and by the time he came back he was unable to locate a copy of the negative and the movie was thought to be lost until a copy was found in a basement in 1938. During the 1920s Flemming tried to re-register the film under a different, more saleable title, but was refused six times by the New South Wales censorship board.

The new deal also sees them broadcast a weekly highlights show of both the premiership and the Premiership Rugby Cup previously shown by ITV. After the demise of the BBC's Rugby Special programme, Channel 5 previously briefly showed free-to-air highlights of English Premiership Rugby during 2000, though these later transferred to Channel 4 for a short time and then subsequently to ITV. Aviva Premiership coverage is presented by former ITV duo David Flatman & Mark Durden-Smith with Flatman also providing commentary alongside Conor McNamara or Mark Robson and Paul Grayson. British Hockey Olympic gold medalist Sam Quek acts as pitch side reporter and completes Channel 5's team Previously, Channel 5 picked up the rights in 1997 to England v Argentina (shown on the same night as the England football team's World Cup qualifier against Poland). They also broadcast a live match between Scotland and invitation side Barbarians in 2000. =Golf= Golf coverage consists of weekly highlights from the PGA Tour, excluding majors. =Athletics= Channel 5 broadcasts live coverage of the Great South Run and a few other marathons a 10-mile road race held in Portsmouth in October. =Mixed Martial Arts= In 2009, Channel 5 signed a deal to broadcast highlights of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) on terrestrial television in the UK.Five agrees deal to show UFC highlights Digital Spy, 9 September 2009 In 2015, Channel 5 picked up highlights of every BAMMA event. =Others= Channel 5 also screened World's Strongest Man between 2006‚Äì2009, and from 2011 to present. =Current sports rights= American Football * Monday night game and weekly highlights Athletics * Great Birmingham Run: Live * Great South Run: Live * Great Birmingham 10k: Live Boxing * Cyclone Promotions & Hennessy Sports Mixed Martial Arts * Bellator * BAMMA Motorsport * MotoGP Highlights * World Rally Championship Highlights * Wales Rally GB Live * Formula E Live Rugby Union * Premiership Rugby (5 Live Matches per season and weekly highlights) * Premiership Rugby 7s Highlights Controversy =Adult entertainment= In 1998, the channel began to show more risqu√© late-night programmes such as Compromising Situations, Hotline and the controversially explicit Sex and Shopping. In 1999, there was a large increase in adult entertainment shown on the channel, including UK Raw and Red Shoe Diaries, giving the channel a reputation for being home to hours of pornography. Adult entertainment, live football, and the 21:00 films were the main source of viewing for the channel at the time. As the broadcaster entered the 2000s, changes were made to address this problem. The level of adult entertainment was scaled back, and reality shows such as Naked Jungle and The Mole proved popular. However, other reality shows such as Touch the Truck and Jailbreak were less successful. =The Farm= The channel attracted some controversy for its reality series The Farm in 2004 and 2005.Five returns to The Farm guardian.co.uk, 21 February 2005 The show, which revolved around celebrities working on a farm, saw Rebecca Loos masturbating a pig in order to collect semen.Farmyard furore as Five lets Rebecca Loos on porker guardian.co.uk, 6 October 2004 See also *Channel 5 (UK) References Channel 5 (UK) Channel 5 (UK) ","title":"Channel 5 (British TV channel) programming"},{"id":"33021494","text":"The 1944‚Äì45 ƒ∞stanbul Football League season was the 37th season of the league.

He appeared in two early vehicles for sports star Snowy Baker, The Enemy Within (1918) and The Lure of the Bush (1918), as well as movies from directors Raymond Longford, Franklyn Barrett, Paulette McDonagh and Beaumont Smith. Biography =Early life= Faulkner was born in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire, England, the 5th of ten children. He was a descendant of Warren Hastings, the first Governor General of Bengal. When he was 13 he was sent to live with relatives in Ontario, Canada. In 1893 he returned to England and worked for several years as a traveller for a brewery. He befriended a young Oscar Asche and the two of them travelled the English countryside selling a fridge that Faulkner had invented. In the early 1900s he was a drinking companion to John Barrymore.Trader Faulkner, 'John Faulkner', Cinema Papers, January 1978 p 211 He started to act, formed his own theatre company and toured South America and North America. While in New York he received an offer to act opposite Ethel Barrymore but turned it down to return to England, where he started making films. He continued to make money on the side by inventing things, such as an elastic-sided shoe. A meeting with Roy Redgrave who had just toured Australia successfully prompted him to move to that country in 1914. He settled in Australia for the next few years, apart from a 1916 visit to Hollywood where he befriended Charlie Chaplin.Trader Faulkner, 'John Faulkner', Cinema Papers, January 1978 p 212 =Film career= Faulkner began acting in Australian silent films, starting with The Enemy Within (1918). Historian Graham Shirley wrote that \\"as an actor, his most distinctive roles were those of the refined heavy, but he also played a gallery of indulgent or put-upon fathers. His appearance was more suited to the villains than fathers.\\"Graham Shirley, 'John Faulkner: Introduction', Cinema Papers, January 1978 p 209 He lived in England for a few years in the 1920s before returning to Australia in 1924. He produced a documentary about a kangaroo cull, On the Trail of the Kangaroo (1925), and acted in two films for the McDonagh sisters, The Far Paradise (1928) and The Cheaters (1930). Faulkner's work in silent film impressed executives at MGM in Hollywood and they offered him a contract, but it was conditional on a medical test and by that stage he had had two strokes and his blood pressure was high. Faulkner married twice, the second time to dancer Sheila Whytock, and became a father at a late age to a son, the future actor Trader Faulkner. Trader later claimed that his father started drinking heavily from 1932 onwards and suffered major financial difficulties. He made and sold his own whiskey at home to earn some extra money. =Death= Faulkner suffered a third stroke on 13 September 1934 and died six days later in the Manly District Hospital. His son later wrote that \\"the family were relieved he had gone, except for me.\\" Trader Faulkner, 'John Faulkner', Cinema Papers, January 1978 p 211 He added that, \\"My father's friends later told me that he was a brilliant raconteur and wit, and a wonderful companion. His genius - like that of his old friend Jack Barrymore - had evidently flourished in the bar. If there was tragedy in his life, it was neglect. He was pushed out to fend for himself when he was just 13. Between then and his marriage, he acquired enormous talent, but had no family life, no purpose, no discipline. Like those he helped in Australian films, he had to learn as he went along.\\"Trader Faulkner, 'John Faulkner', Cinema Papers, January 1978 p 277 Filmography *The Enemy Within (1918) *¬£500 Reward (1918) *The Lure of the Bush (1918) *The Breaking of the Drought (1918) *The Man from Snowy River (1920) *Silks and Saddles (1921) *The Blue Mountains Mystery (1921) *Birth of New Zealand (1921) *On the Trail of the Kangaroo (1925) - documentary, producer only *Peter Vernon's Silence (1926) *The Far Paradise (1928) *Odds On (1928) *The Kingdom of Twilight (1929) aka Tanami *The Cheaters (1930) References External links * *John Faulkner at National Film and Sound Archive Category:1872 births Category:1934 deaths Category:British emigrants to Australia Category:Male actors from New South Wales ","title":"John Faulkner (actor)"},{"id":"33021520","text":"Memonic is an online notetaking application that allows users to save and organize information while conducting research online and offline.

The work in this area of the industry includes maintenance of oil platforms and the building of underwater structures. In this context \\"\\" implies that the diving work is done outside of national boundaries. Technically it also refers to any diving done in the international offshore waters outside of the territorial waters of a state, where national legislation does not apply. Most commercial offshore diving is in the Exclusive Economic Zone of a state, and much of it is outside the territorial waters. Offshore diving beyond the EEZ does also occur, and is often for scientific purposes. Equipment used for commercial offshore diving tends to be surface supplied equipment but this varies according to the work and location. For instance, divers in the Gulf of Mexico may use wetsuits whilst North Sea divers need dry suits or even hot water suits because of the low temperature of the water. Diving work in support of the offshore oil and gas industries is usually contract based. Saturation diving is standard practice for bottom work at many of the deeper offshore sites, and allows more effective use of the diver's time while reducing the risk of decompression sickness. Surface oriented air diving is more usual in shallower water. Scope of work The offshore diver may do a wide range of tasks in support of offshore drilling or production. =Drilling rig support= Much of the offshore seabed diving work is inspection, maintenance and repair of the blow-out preventers (BOPs) and their permanent guide bases. The primary functions of a blow-out preventer system are to confine well fluid to the wellbore, provide a way to add fluid to the wellbore and to allow controlled volumes of fluid to be withdrawn from the wellbore. Dive work includes assistance with guiding the blowout preventer stack (BOP stack) onto the guide base, inspection of the BOP stack, checking connections, troubleshooting malfunctions of the hydraulic, mechanical and electrical systems, and inspection of the rig's anchors. =Production platform support= There are a wide range of production platforms which are chosen to suit the water depth, expected sea conditions and other constraints. Diving work will depend on the details, but will generally involve inspection, maintenance and repair of the structure, wellheads, manifolds, risers, associated pipelines and mooring systems. Divers may work on marine risers (conduits that extend a subsea oil well to a surface facility) and blowout prevention stacks on all production rig types if the depth is within diving range. Work may be surface oriented or in saturation depending on depth and duration. Depths are relatively shallow on jack-up rigs, which stand on the seabed, and are limited to depths less than about 90m. Much of the diving may be on air. Diving work may include inspection of the seabed before jack-up, measurement of penetration depth of legs, monitoring and management of scour around the legs where they rest on the seabed, inspection and repair of underwater structural components of the rig and support of anchor deployment and recovery. Semi-submersible platforms operate in a wider range of depths, mostly relatively deep, and bottom work is more likely to be in saturation and using heliox. There is also shallow work on the hull which is likely to be on air: inspection of thrusters, pontoons and the rest of the underwater structure of the rig and when necessary repair. Wellheads Wellheads control the production of oil or gas from the well, and can be used for water injection. They are mounted on production guidebases, which are the upper endpoint of the well casing at the seabed. A well head can be directly connected to a subsea manifold or indirectly via other wellheads, which may be arranged in groups called a subsea template. Most diving work on wellheads and manifolds is installation and maintenance. Manifolds Subsea manifolds are structures mounted on the seabed where pipelines and connections to wellheads are connected to control the flow of product from the wells to their next destination. They will include valves and control mechanisms for the valves, and diving work mostly involves inspection and maintenance work, but can also include installation and repair, and connecting in new wellheads. =Pipeline work= A large amount of offshore diving work is associated with pipeline work, particularly with pipeline connections. Depths may range from deep to shallow, and procedures and diving mode will be chosen to suit. Work includes aspects of pipe laying and trenching, and work on existing pipelines and ancillary equipment. Pipelay barges Simplified drawings of three common systems used for the construction and installation of subsea pipelines (not to scale): S-lay, J-lay and reel. A pipelay barge, or lay barge, is used to lay submarine pipelines by welding pipe sections to the pipeline on board, inspecting and coating the joint, and lowering the assembled part to the seabed over a projecting supporting structure called a stinger which guides the pipe and controls the curve at the end of the barge (overbend) in a more or less continuous process. As the pipe approaches the seabed, the pipe takes a convex-downward curve (the sagbend) before making contact with the bottom. the sagbend is controlled by tension applied from the vessel and tension wires from the pipeline on the bottom to anchors which prevent it from being dragged out of position by the barge. Diving work on lay barges includes shallow inspection and maintenance work on the stinger, and deeper work at the bottom associated with the pipe and pipeline connections. Shallow work is usually on air, and may include stinger inspection, Checks that the pipeline runs smoothly and is not damaged before leaving the stinger, placing and checking CCTV cameras for monitoring the pipe transit, operating manual valves on the stinger buoyancy system and work on the mooring system. Deep work will use breathing gas appropriate to the depth, and may include checking the as-laid condition of the pipe and coating, grout bagging long spans for support, connection of flanges, bolt tensioning and hyperbaric welding, Attachment, operation and removal of pigging equipment, and attachment, removal and moving of constant tension wires. Pipeline stabilisation There are several ways that a pipeline can be stabilised on the seabed, and diver intervention is required on most of them. Concrete mattresses are used to weigh down the pipeline to hold it in place, particularly on bends, but may also be laid under the pipe to stabilise the substrate. Frond mattresses are mainly used to stabilise the sand, and are usually anchored to the bottom. Sandbags and gravel help prevent scour, and can be used to support areas where the pipe spans a local depression. Trenching protects the pipeline from current and external loads such as from iceberg gouging, trawl nets and anchors, and saddles and ground anchors can secure the pipeline against lateral movement when located by piles or grouted to the substrate. Deploying these items usually requires diver input for controlling the placement, and may also require the diver to physically move components like sandbags. Trenching barges Simplified drawing showing a typical jetting system for trenching below a submarine pipeline that is lying on the seafloor. Trenching barges are used to excavate a trench on the seabed for a pipeline or cable to protect and stabilise it. Infilling is usually left to the natural action of the water on the seabed. The actual excavation is done by a sled which may use water jets, airlifts or mechanical plough systems to remove material and form the trench. This is generally done by towing the sled along using the pipeline to guide it after the pipeline is in position. The trench is progressively excavated under the pipeline, which sags into it as it is formed. Motion of the trenching barge is generally controlled by heaving in on the forward anchors and slacking away the stern anchors, which will periodically be moved by a service vessel. Diving tasks may include inspection of the pipeline and trench, including measurements where applicable, setting the sled and dealing with problems which may arise during the trenching operation. Connections Connections may include tie-in of a pipeline to a platform riser, wellhead, manifold, or another pipeline by end or tee connection, insertion of valves, and connection to flexible hoses at single point moorings. The work may include measurement and survey of the components to be connected, welded and flanged connections, including inspection, alignment, surface preparation, fitting of gaskets and bolts, tensioning of bolts and testing. Disconnecting may also be necessary, which may involve splitting, cutting and burning work. When welding is necessary a hyperbaric welding chamber may be fitted around the pipeline so that welding can be done in an inert gaseous environment rather than wet, as this improves the weld quality. Depending on circumstances, the chamber may be large enough for the welder to work inside, but as the chamber must be accessed at depth and is under ambient pressure, the work must be done by a diver. Pipeline inspection Pipeline inspection is done by divers or remotely operated vehicles (ROVs). Inspection requirements may be set by owners, certifying authorities, insurance companies and government departments, and there are a number of tasks which may be specified. These generally include inspection for pipeline stability, damage and fouling, and the inspection is usually recorded on video with a running commentary, and by still photography for details. Damage will be measured and the position and extent recorded. Repairs will also be usually be done by divers. Pigging A pig is a tool that fits closely into the bore of a pipe and is driven along the inside of a pipeline by a pressure differential and used to perform a specific task for which it is specially designed. Pigging is done to inspect the bore, scrape off deposits, sediment or corrosion products, or separate two different product batches. Access to the pipeline for inserting or removing pigs must be done by divers when the access point is underwater. The diver may also connect pressure hoses, open and close valves, and monitor progress of the pig past indicator stations. Pigs are designed to pass through fully opened gate and ball valves, and round bends, but the negotiable bend radius depends on the pig design. =Single point mooring systems= A single point or single buoy mooring system is a facility for loading and unloading petroleum products to tankers, which moor to them only by the bow. One or two flexible hoses are used to transfer the products between the pipeline and tanker. A SPM may be used in deep water to take oil from the oilfield via a production platform, an in shallow water to export or import crude oil or oil products from an oilfield or refinery, usually by way of a storage facility. A range of single point mooring configurations are in use, and installation, maintenance and inspection work on all types is commonly done by divers. The work may include placing the pipeline end manifold (PLEM) and connecting it to the submarine pipelines, installing anchor chains and checking and adjusting chain angles, installing the submarine hoses between the PLEM and the buoy, installing a ships mooring system and operating subsea valves. The work is likely to involve the use of winches and cranes, rigging, including use of tirfors, chain hoists, strops and spreaders, flanging, using wrenches, hammers and gaskets, oxy-arc burning and welding. Diving equipment The diving equipment used for offshore work is chosen to facilitate the work to be done while exposing the personnel involved to an acceptably low level of risk. When reasonably practicable, use of remotely operated underwater vehicles is preferred, as this avoids exposing the diver to underwater hazards. There is still a large amount of underwater work for which diver intervention is the only available alternative. =Surface oriented diving= Most of the shallower offshore diving is done by divers who do the dive on air and then exit the water, doing any required decompression in the water or as surface decompression in a chamber. This diving is done either on surface-supplied diving equipment using a low- pressure compressor to supply the breathing air, or on Scuba replacement, a more mobile form of surface supplied diving where the breathing air is supplied from high pressure storage cylinders on the dive boat. Scuba may be used by some operators for some work, but it is not considered suitable for offshore work by IMCA. =Saturation diving= Saturation diving is one way to reduce the overall risk to the diver while improving productivity. It is a very expensive, fairly hazardous and high-tech way of controlling risk economically. This apparent contradiction can be explained by the amount of time the diver can spend working productively for the time spent decompressing. The time required for decompression depends on the exposure pressure and duration, but it reaches a maximum for a given depth when the diver is saturated with inert gas at that depth. During decompression there is a risk of decompression sickness, which is, as a general rule, reduced by decompressing more slowly. In-water decompression can only be tolerated for relatively short periods, as it exposes the diver to other hazards, some of them proportional to the duration, so decompression in a dry chamber is preferred. Preferably the chamber can be removed from the water during decompression, for further reduction of exposure to hazards, so the chamber must be pressurised. This chamber should be reasonably small to keep down the cost of deployment, so it is an advantage to transfer the divers into a more spacious and comfortable chamber on the surface platform, which also allows the bell to be used for the next shift while the first divers are decompressing. The procedure described so far is known as bell bounce diving, and it is used for work where the amount of time spent at depth is relatively short. When the time spent decompressing would exceed the time between shifts, the diver would be more profitably employed underwater, and the time in the chamber would be less risky if the diver was not being decompressed, so a larger set of chambers can be used, in which the divers spend off-shift time under the same pressure they will experience at the underwater worksite. At the end of the job they are all decompressed together slowly, but the total time in decompression is reduced. This is cost-effective and puts the divers at less risk of decompression sickness than bounce diving for the same amount of time at the worksite. The personal diving equipment used by saturation divers is similar to that used by surface supplied divers, with the addition of the closed bell and saturation system. The longer deeper dives and helium based breathing gases expose the saturation diver to greater heat loss, so hot-water suits are more likely to be used, and the cost of the helium makes it more likely that breathing gas reclaim systems will be used. These are systems where the exhaled gas is piped back to the surface for recycling. =Diving support vessels= Diving support vessel Toisa Polaris Iremis da Vinci at the Albert Dock Basin, Port of Leith. A multi-purpose diving support vessel, built in the Republic of Korea in 2011, and registered at Majuro, Marshall Islands, It is 115.4m long and has a gross tonnage of 8691t, Offshore diving may be from a stationary platform or a diving support vessel. Most diving is from moored or anchored vessels as live-boat diving exposes the diver to additional hazards of thrusters and propellers. Special precautions are needed when diving from dynamically positioned vessels. The size of the vessel may range from small boats capable of supporting a dive team using scuba replacement to large support vessels with full saturation systems, launch and recovery systems and heavy lifting gear. Moonpools Some diving support vessels have an opening through the bottom of the hull called a moonpool to facilitate diver deployment. This is usually the part of the vessel with the least vertical motion in a seaway, which makes launch and recovery of the bell or stage easier, safer and more comfortable for the divers. Diving from dynamically positioned vessels Dynamically positioned vessels (DPVs) are vessels which can hold a position and heading by computer-controlled operation of thrusters and propellers. In many cases this can be done sufficiently precisely to use as a platform for diving operations, but there are specific hazards associated with this mode of diving. The vessel control system monitors its position by reference systems which may include taut wire, radar surface stations (Artemis), Seabed acoustic transponders (Hydracoustic Position Reference) or Differential Global Positioning System, using satellites and a terrestrial base station. International Marine Contractors Association (IMCA) guidance requires at least three independent referencing systems of at least two different types for DPV diving operations, to minimise the risk of loss of position. The DP footprint is the scope of movement of the vessel, and it is limited for safety of the divers. Three alert levels are provided to the diving team to indicate the current capacity of the vessel to maintain position. Green indicates normal status, where diving work can be done, yellow indicates partly degraded status, where the divers would be recalled to the bell, and red indicates emergency status, where the dive would be aborted. The particular hazards of DPV diving include loss of position and thruster hazards. Special precautions are taken to prevent divers from getting into the danger zones of thrusters and propellers. These include limiting umbilical length, and other physical restraints. Management and control of diving operations Offshore diving practices are basically similar in principle to inshore diving practices, but are extended to include practices specific to the equipment and environment. =Personnel= The usual commercial diving management system of having a diving supervisor of appropriate competence in direct and immediate control of a diving operation is also standard for offshore work. IMCA has a system for certification of offshore air and saturation diving supervisors, which is recognised and used by all signatory contractors. This system is fairly representative of most offshore diving operations, but details may differ. A major diving project or offshore installation may also have a diving superintendent on staff. The diving superintendent is usually a senior diving supervisor appointed by the diving contractor and is responsible for the overall planning and conduct of diving work, and will be responsible for allocating a diving supervisor for each diving operation. A saturation system will be managed by a Life Support Supervisor and operated by Life Support Technicians (LSTs), and there will usually be one or more Diving Medical Technicians (DMTs)on site, and an off-site standby contract with a suitably rated Diving Medical Practitioner, who is trained in diving medicine and able to advise on treatment under hyperbaric conditions. =Diving team= The diving team will include at least one working diver and at least one standby diver, a diving supervisor and a tender for each diver. Other personnel may be needed to operate special equipment like winches and a bell launch and recovery system, and to operate cranes and other equipment related to the work to be done. If the divers are deployed using a diving bell, the standby diver stays in the bell and is called the bellman. The bellman acts as tender for the working diver's umbilical, but must tend his own umbilical during a rescue. The working diver and bellman may swap functions during a shift to give the diver a break. A standard practice is for the standby diver's umbilical to be about 2m longer than the working diver's umbilical, to ensure that the standby diver can reach the diver in an emergency. =Saturation dives= Saturation divers will live under pressure in the saturation system between dives. They are pressurised at the beginning of a tour of duty and remain under storage pressure at as close as reasonably practicable to the working depth until they are decompressed at the end of the tour, which may take up to two weeks, depending on the storage pressure. Excursions to deeper and shallower working depths are carefully planned and controlled to minimise the risk of decompression sickness. Limited excursions may be possible without special decompression, but larger excursions may require part of the saturation system to be isolated for additional decompression, or if short, it can be done in the bell. The bell can be locked onto the saturation system, and the divers transfer from the saturation system living quarters to the bell under pressure. When the bell reaches working depth the bottom lock is opened and the divers get out and back in through it. Before surfacing the bell the lock is closed and sealed to maintain internal pressure, and the divers transfer back to the saturation system living quarters under pressure. =Bounce dives= Surface oriented dives are those in which the diver is not under saturation. These are also referred to as bounce dives, and the divers may be deployed using a diving stage, wet bell or closed bell, or for shallow dives directly from the vessel or platform, depending on what water access is available. Launch and recovery systems (LARS) are used to lower the stage or bell and to lift it out after the dive. =Risk management= Once risks have been identified and assessed, all techniques to manage the risk fall into one or more of these four major categories: * Avoidance (eliminate, withdraw from or not become involved) * Reduction (optimize ‚Äì mitigate) * Sharing (transfer ‚Äì outsource or insure) * Retention (accept and budget) Ideal use of these strategies may not be possible. Some of them may involve trade-offs that are not acceptable to the organization or person making the risk management decisions. Health and safety Offshore diving generally takes place at remote sites, and emergency medical facilities may be far away, so it is common to include relatively complex and expensive emergency facilities and personnel on site. The actual diving work is usually done by one or two divers, backed up by a team of support personnel, both to facilitate getting the work done, and to provide an acceptably low level of risk for the diver and other affected personnel. Offshore diving operations are expensive and inherently hazardous, so extensive planning and effective management are necessary to control risk and ensure that the necessary work is done effectively. =Legislation and codes of practice= National regulations The Approved Code of Practice and guidance for Commercial diving projects offshore published by the HSE provides guidance on compliance with the UK Diving at Work Regulations 1997 IMCA guidance IMCA members are obliged to comply with IMCA guidance in their diving operations. This is guidance is provided in a group of documents detailing industry recognised good practice for various aspects of offshore diving, including: * IMCA D 006 Diving operations in the vicinity of pipelines * IMCA D 010 Diving operations from vessels operating in dynamically positioned mode * IMCA D 014 IMCA international code of practice for offshore diving * IMCA D 018 Code of practice for the initial and periodic examination, testing and certification of diving plant and equipment * IMCA D 019 Diving operations in support of intervention on wellheads and subsea facilities * IMCA D 021 Diving in contaminated waters * IMCA D 022 Guidance for diving supervisors * IMCA D 025 Evacuation of divers from installations * IMCA D 030 Surface supplied mixed gas diving operations * IMCA D 034 Norway/UK Regulatory Guidance on Offshore Diving (NURGOD) * IMCA D 042 Diver and ROV based concrete mattress handling, deployment, installation, repositioning and decommissioning * IMCA D 052 Guidance on hyperbaric evacuation systems * IMCA D 054 Remotely operated vehicle intervention during diving operations =Hazards= A hazard is any agent or situation that poses a level of threat to life, health, property, or environment. Most hazards remain dormant or potential, with only a theoretical risk of harm, and when a hazard becomes active, and produces undesirable consequences, it is called an incident and may culminate in an emergency or accident. Divers face specific physical and health risks when they go underwater or use high pressure breathing gas. When a diver enters the water there is inherently a risk of drowning, and breathing while exposed to pressure imposes a risk of barotrauma and decompression sickness. There are some hazards which are more common in the offshore environment and in offshore diving operations. There is more diving at extreme depths than in other applications, and the solutions to this bring their own hazards. In order to reduce the risks of compression arthralgia and decompression sickness, saturation divers decompress only once at the end of a tour of duty, but this introduces hazards associated with living under pressure and requiring a long decompression schedule. Helium gas is used in breathing mixtures to reduce work of breathing and nitrogen narcosis, which would make deep diving work difficult or impossible, but the consequences include accelerated heat loss and higher risk of hypothermia, so hot-water suits are used for active warming, but they introduce a risk of heat injuries if something goes wrong with the temperature control system. Work on oilfields may result in exposure to crude oil and natural gas components, some of which (such as hydrogen sulphide) can be highly toxic. Much of the diving work involves moving and handling large and heavy objects, and inherently hazardous tools and equipment. These hazards are usually aggravated by the underwater environment. The inherent problems with offshore evacuation in emergencies like fire or sinking, which are problematic for ordinary crew, are much more difficult to deal with for divers in saturation. The methods of controlling the risks due to these hazards are usually engineering solutions, and are expensive, and often introduce secondary hazards which must also be managed. =Risk= Hazard and vulnerability interact with likelihood of occurrence to create risk, which can be the probability of a specific undesirable consequence of a specific hazard, or the combined probability of undesirable consequences of all the hazards of a specific activity. The presence of a combination of several hazards simultaneously is common in diving, and the effect is generally increased risk to the diver, particularly where the occurrence of an incident due to one hazard triggers other hazards with a resulting cascade of incidents. Many diving fatalities are the result of a cascade of incidents overwhelming the diver, who should be able to manage any single reasonably foreseeable incident. The assessed risk of a dive would generally be considered unacceptable if the diver is not expected to cope with any single reasonably foreseeable incident with a significant probability of occurrence during that dive. Precisely where the line is drawn depends on circumstances. Commercial diving operations are constrained by occupational health and safety legislation, but also by the physical realities of the operating environment, and expensive engineering solutions are often necessary to control risk. Assessed risk Risk assessment is the determination of an estimate of risk related to a well-defined situation and a recognized set of hazards. Quantitative risk assessment requires calculations of two components of risk : the magnitude of the potential loss, and the probability that the loss will occur. An acceptable risk is a risk that is understood and tolerated, usually because the cost or difficulty of implementing an effective countermeasure for the associated vulnerability exceeds the expectation of loss. A formal hazard identification and risk assessment is a standard and required part of the planning for a commercial diving operation, and this is also the case for offshore diving operations. The occupation is inherently hazardous, and great effort and expense are routinely incurred to keep the risk within an acceptable range. The standard methods of reducing risk are followed where possible. Statistical risk Statistics on injuries related to commercial diving are normally collected by national regulators. In the UK the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) is responsible for the overview of about 5,000 commercial divers, and in Norway the corresponding authority is the Petroleum Safety Authority Norway (PSA), which has maintained the DSYS databse since 1985, gathering statistics on over 50,000 diver-hours of commercial activity per year. In 2013 the UK HSE reported a fatal accident rate for commercial offshore and inland/inshore diving of typically 20-40 per 100,000 workers per year. That is much more than the rate found in construction or agricultural activities and results in diving being classified as \\"high hazard\\" by the HSE. According to a 2011 report to PSA, the last recorded saturation diving fatality in Norway occurred in 1987, and few serious incidents happened over the preceding 25 years. In 2010 there were two reported incidents leading to injuries. Training and qualification The qualifications required for offshore diving work are to a large extent outside the normal jurisdiction of national governments due to the geographical situation of the work-sites, but the contractors and client organisations are bound by national and international legislation, and the procedural guidelines of organisations of which they may be members or signatories. A large number of international marine contractors are members of the International Marine Contractors Association (IMCA), and much of international offshore diving follows IMCA procedures. =Diver training and certification= Offshore divers are trained in the use of surface supplied diving equipment, which is standard for most offshore diving work. As much offshore diving contracts are carried out by members of IMCA, a large majority of the divers are registered with certification recognised by IMCA and the International Diving Regulators Forum (IDRF). Recognised qualifications listed by the International Diving Schools Association include: IDSA Level 3: Surface Supplied Offshore Air Diver equivalence:Staff, IDSA, (2012)The IDSA Table of Equivalence: A List of Schools teaching the IDSA Standards together with their National equivalent 6 January 2012, http://www.idsaworldwide.org/docs/toe2012.pdf accessed 7 July 2016 *Australia: Part 3 *Canada: Unrestricted Surface Supplied Diver to 50m + Unrestricted SCUBA *Denmark: Surface Supplied Diver to 50m *France: Class 2 Mention A *Morocco: Class 2 Mention A *Netherlands: Certificate B *New Zealand: Part 3 *Norway: Petroleum Safety Authority (PSA) Part 1 : Surface orientated Diver North Sea Offshore *South Africa: Class 2 *Sweden: Diver Certificate C Wet Bell 60m *UK: HSE Part 1, HSE SCUBA plus HSE Surface Supply plus Tools Training module plus Surface Supplied Top Up IDSA Level 4: Closed Bell Mixed Gas Diver equivalence: *Australia: Part 4 diver *Canada: Bell diver *France: Class 3 Mention A *New Zealand: Part 3 *Norway: NPD Bell Diver *South Africa: Class 1 *UK: HSE Part 2, HSE Closed Bell =Offshore diving supervisor registration= All offshore diving operations by IMCA registered contractors must be under the control of an IMCA supervisor. There are two levels: *IMCA Air Diving Supervisor *IMCA Bell Diving Supervisor =Work skills training and assessment= Some work skills are implied by IDSA equivalent certification, and are included in diver training for these certificates,Staff, IDSA,(2009), International Diver Training Certification: Diver Training Standards, Section C7: Underwater work, Revision 4, October 2009 http://www.idsaworldwide.org/docs/diverts0909.pdf Accessed 8 July 2016 but many of the more complex and technical skills must be learned elsewhere. There is no prescription for where these other skills are learned, and it is generally left to the employer to ensure that their employees are competent to do the job for which they are hired, and for the contractor to ensure that they deploy personnel who are competent to do the job for the client. IMCA provides guidance for assessment of several key offshore diving competences, which are transferable between IMCA member employers, but is not directly involved in the assessments. Some of these competences are renewable periodically, to ensure that the diver is currently competent. Portfolio of evidence based systems are used where the diver keeps a record of assessments, verification records and evidence in the form of competence appraisal forms, work records and testimonials by competent witnesses. Where competence is shown by records of formal education and training by a reputable organisation this may be recognised, but a significant part of training may be on the job. Historical issues =Timeline of offshore diving= The first commercial offshore saturation dive was performed by Westinghouse in the Gulf of Mexico following Hurricane Betsy in March 1966. Not long after, in 1970, saturation diving in the North Sea at Ekofisk commenced. =Accidents in the offshore diving industry= The offshore diving industry is hazardous, and has had a number of serious accidents over the years, and though working procedures and equipment have evolved in response to accident analysis, and the record has improved, offshore diving remains a relatively dangerous occupation. This section lists some of the more notable incidents. *Byford Dolphin (1983) *Death of Bradley Westell (1995) *Drill Master accident (1974) *Star Canopus accident (1978) *Venture One accident (1977) *Waage Drill II accident (1975) *Wildrake accident (1979) =Litigation in Norway's sector= A 7 December 2013 Verdens Gang editorial said that \\"According to the divers' own numbers, 66 divers died while on duty during the pioneering age\\" in the North Sea with the first commercial diving casualty occurring as early as October 2, 1967. One notable accident in 1983 aboard the Byford Dolphin claimed the lives of five divers. A 2013 European Court of Human Rights verdict said that the [pioneer] divers were \\"in a situation risking their lives and health when they took on the dangerous job. The government should have taken [occupational] safety measures. But on the contrary. The tables that showed how fast the divers were to [come to the] surface after a dive, were held secret by the companies. Faster surfacing resulted in a cheaper dive, but also increased the risk. The government's control and follow-up was too poor.\\" (In Norway's sector of the North Sea, 17 divers died during a 20 year-period from 1967 ‚Äî 11 individuals were British. In 2013 Aftenposten said that \\"During the pioneering period, most of the [oil] companies used (forholdt seg til) dive tables based on research by U.S. Navy. The dive tables were supposed to ensure that the divers avoided so called bends. The problem was that the U.S tables were formulated for divers during a transportation phase in a crisis situation. Not for shift work over several hours. The tables were also created for survival possibilities during an acute (akutt) evacuation‚Äînot necessarily concerning oneself with issues of long-term health. Authors Kristin √òye Gjerde and Helge Ryggvik indicate that several international companies often competed in pressing (√• presse) the tables further. Status was acquired by beating the records. Effectivity (effektivitet) put [more] money in the till.\\") Aftenposten also claimed that \\"The first trade union came in 1977\\"; Teknisk Ukeblad says that divers first joined the trade union in 1978. On 1 July 1978 a set of \\"temporary rules\\" [for diving] were instituted‚Äî12 years after diving had started and 11 years after the first serious accident. Furthermore, \\"According to the Lossius Commission (a fact-finding commission ordered by the Cabinet in 2000) around 3 of 4 divers had accidents or diving related illnesses. Over half had bends, and 83% encountered life-endangering situations while diving.\\" Norway's government has claimed responsibility for pioneering divers on a moral and political foundation, without taking a judicial responsibility for medical injuries. 80 applicants, out of 340, have been denied governmental compensation for pioneering divers. In 2013 in the European Court of Human Rights three commercial divers won their case against Norway. (In 2012 European Court of Human Rights stated it will try the case of three commercial divers that lost their case in Norway's supreme court in 2010. The court had not concluded in the case, as of August 2013.)

The legislative body is headed by the city mayor while the executive body is headed by a Chief Commissioner. It consists of 100 wards within the city limits.  History  The municipality of Madurai was constituted on 1 November 1866 as per the Town Improvement Act of 1865. The municipality was headed by a chairperson and elections were regularly conducted for the post except during the period 1891 to 1896, when no elections were held due to violent factionalism. A Secretary was appointed in 1898 to assist the Municipal Chairperson. A municipal office was established in 1871-72 in a portion of the Thirumalai Nayak's palace. The municipality repaired a causeway across the Vaigai River in 1884 and founded a maternity hospital in 1873. In 1892, the Madurai municipality commissioned 'Arappalayam Water Works' a water-supply project headed by J. A. Jones, Sanitary Engineer to the Madras government, to construct a channel redirecting the waters of the Vaigai River and purifying them. The project was eventually completed in 1894 at a cost of Rs.6,23,000, including a Rs.1,96,000 grant from the government of Madras Presidency. The cost of maintenance was estimated at Rs.32,753. A drainage system for the portion surrounded by the four Masi streets was completed in 1902. During the early years of independent India, the Madurai municipality was dominated by reformists of the Indian National Congress.As early as December 1923, the municipality had passed a resolution prohibiting the sale of liquor and intoxicants in Madurai city.Madurai was upgraded to a municipal corporation on 1 May 1971 as per the Madurai City Municipal Corporation Act, 1971. It is the second oldest municipal corporation in Tamil Nadu, after Chennai.  Structure  The Madurai Municipal Corporation The Madurai City Municipal Corporation Council, the legislative body, comprises 100 councillors elected from each of the 100 wards and is headed by a mayor assisted by a Deputy Mayor. The executive wing is made up of seven departments: general administration, revenue, town planning, engineering, public health, information technology and personnel and is headed by a City Commissioner. The Commissioner is assisted by two executive engineers for the east and west sections, and Assistant Commissioners for personnel, accounts and revenue departments, a public relations officer, a city engineer, a city health officer and an Assistant Commissioner for each of the four zones  List of mayors  * S.

It infects many freshwater and brackish fish species in the Asia- Pacific region and Australia. The disease is most commonly seen when there are low temperature and heavy rainfall in tropical and sub-tropical waters. Clinical signs and diagnosis At first, fish develop red spots on the skin. These lesions expand to form ulcers and extensive erosions filled with necrotic tissue and mycelium. This is followed by the development of granulomas on the internal organs and death. A provisional diagnosis can be made by using squash preparations of the skeletal muscle from beneath an ulcer to identify the septate hyphae of the water mould. Definitive diagnosis can be made based on histopathogical findings and isolation of the pathogen. Treatment and control Infected fish should be moved into high quality water, where they may recover if their clinical signs are mild. If disease occurs eradication is required. Once the disease is eradicated good husbandry, surveillance and biosecurity measures are necessary to prevent recurrence. In countries free of epizootic ulcerative syndrome, quarantine and health certificates are necessary for the movement of all live fish to prevent the introduction of the disease.

It was the first Australian movie to be directed by a woman.Ina Bertrand, 'Celebrating Kate Howarde', Senses of Cinema, August 2002 Only portions of it survive today. Plot Andrew \\"Dad\\" McQuade (John Cosgrove), a tough farmer, faces ruin because of a bank loan he cannot repay. He decides to sell a fifty-acre field called 'Possum Paddock' to his greedy neighbour, Dan Martin (James Martin). However, Hugh Bracken (Jack Kirby), who is dating McQuade's daughter, Nancy (Leslie Adrien), sells his car to pay off the old man's debts. He then discovers that a railway is to go through the paddock and is worth a fortune. Original Play The play premiered in Sydney in 1919 and was a massive hit, touring for the next ten months. It starred John Cosgrove and Howarde herself, along with Fred MacDonald. The play was revived a number of times over the years. Production Howarde made the film in collaboration with actor Charles Villers. The adaptation turned the story into a more serious melodrama rather than a broad comedy. It was shot at the Rushcutter's Bay studio established by Charles Cozens Spencer. Many of the cast had appeared in the original stage production, including Howarde and her daughter Leslie Adrien, who played the female lead. New South Wales censors insisted a subplot about an unmarried mother be cut, in particular a scene where she imagines throwing her baby into a river.Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper, Australian Film 1900‚Äì1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production, Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1998, 103 Reception Although the film appears to have been commercially successful, Howarde made no further films, preferring to concentrate on her theatre career.

The horse is approximately 180 feet high and 160 feet long, and was cut in 1812 under the commission of local farmer Robert Pile. Pile instructed inn sign painter John Thorne to design and cut the horse, although Thorne conned Pile by leaving with his advance sum while employing local resident John Harvey to cut the horse instead. It is based on another white horse hill figure in Wiltshire, the Cherhill White Horse, and is the second-biggest of nine white horses in Wiltshire. One of the county's best-loved and most iconic white horses, it remains a tourist attraction and has been regularly maintained throughout time, with numerous groups or individuals scouring the horse throughout its life. More recently, the horse was illuminated by candles every winter solstice for over ten years, as well as in a lantern parade to celebrate the horse's 200th birthday in 2012. The horse has also been transformed into a zebra on April Fools' Day on two occasions. Description and location Alton Barnes White Horse in 2006. Alton Barnes White Horse is located on the southern, 35¬∞ slope of Milk Hill, also known locally as \\"Old Adam,\\" the tallest hill in Wiltshire with a 295 metre high peak. The horse is sited on the ridge which connects Milk Hill to Walker's Hill, overlooking Pewsey Vale; the land is part of the Pewsey Down Nature Reserve. The figure is visible for 22 miles, but particularly good road views of it can be seen from the Honey Street canal bridge, the Alton Priors road, and the Lockeridge road which approaches the white horse itself. One of the furthest views of the horse on a clear day is said to be from Old Sarum near Salisbury. The horse can be reached via a footpath from a nearby parking space and from atop the hill. A fence is erected around the horse to prevent damage from wildstock and tourists. The figure is located near two Iron Age hill forts, located atop Milk Hill and the nearby Walker's Hill, and the Adam's Grave long barrow. The chalk horse is 166 feet (51 metres) tall and 160 feet (49 metres) wide, and, to prevent foreshortening, is disproportionately tall. It is based on and is said to resemble the nearby Cherhill White Horse, cut in 1780, although the Alton Barnes horse is slightly larger. It was possible the horse was even bigger in the past, as Revd E.H.M. Sladen, measuring the horse in 1868 when he was the village's incumbent, claimed the horse was 180 feet high and 165 feet wide. Author Paul Newman describes the horse's appearance as distinctive, \\"with its docked tail and trotting stance.\\" 1920s poet and essayist E.V. Lucas described the horse as having \\"a swan-like neck and penetrating eye.\\" Over the years, the shape of the Alton Barnes White Horse has been altered considerably, with its eye becoming larger, its neck becoming more thinned, the shape of its legs being improved and the addition of lips and ears, despite an outline of ears being present in the horse's originally proposed design. Origins Alton Barnes White Horse was cut in 1812 on the instructions of one Robert Pile, a tenant of Manor Farm, located in the village of Alton Barnes. This may be the same Robert Pile who cut the original version of the nearby Pewsey White Horse in 1785, or perhaps his son, given that the Alton Barnes horse was created 27 years later. Selecting the southern slope of Milk Hill for the horse, Pile contacted a journeyman inn sign painter, John Thorne, also known as Jack the Painter, to design and cut the horse, and paid him an advance sum of ¬£20. Pile and Thorne agreed that the white horse would be excavated to a depth of 1 foot (half a metre) and subsequently packed with chalk rubble. Thorne provided Pile with a sketch of the proposed horse, sketched from the Honey Street canal bridge; it resembled Cherhill White Horse and its walking pose, except with ears which were only outlined with chalk. However, although Thorne was supposed to create the horse himself, he discreetly employed another man, Stanton St Bernard resident John Harvey, to do the turf-stripping and digging, and after Harvey had gone about his task and the horse's outline was clearly visible, Thorne ran away, taking his ¬£20 advance with him. According to contrasting accounts, Pile either had to pay Harvey a similar sum to finish the work, or was left to complete the horse himself. Thorne was later caught and hanged for a series of crimes. According to Paul Newman, author of Lost Gods of Albion, Thorne's Bohemian background and mischievous intent when asked to cut the horse has cemented him as a unique figure within the history of hill figures: \\"Although one cannot applaud John Thorne for his less than scrupulous attitude towards the duties he had undertaken, he has enlivened the annals of turf-cutting by bringing to this eccentric art a low, Bohemian shiftiness, pleasantly at variance with the solid trustworthiness of the squires and local worthies so often encountered in the histories of these figures.\\" Maintenance and scouring The horse from the air in 2015. Having been scoured regularly since it was cut, Alton Barnes White Horse has been well looked after. According to author Esther Smith, \\"at times, this horse has fallen into disrepair but it has always had just enough attention to keep it from disappearing altogether.\\" Those responsible for scouring the horse have changed over time, as some scourings in the mid-19th century were paid for by subscription, and Scouts, Guides and local organizations have also scoured the horse. On one occasion in 1866, a chalk pit was dug above the horse's head by the scourers, presumably so that they did not need to transport the chalk from further afield, and subsequently scoured the horse with fresh chalk from the pit. According to Smith, writing in 2004, \\"this was a mistake as the pit never really grew over again properly and can still be seen quite clearly.\\" During World War II, the horse was successfully concealed to hide it from the German air force. The horse was scoured in 1987 with the aid of aid of army helicopters helping to fly in fresh chalk. By 2009, the horse was losing its shape and had browned slightly, so with an estimated cost of ¬£21,000, the Alton Barnes Parish Council and landowner Tim Carson gave the horse a full restoration in September and October 2009, where a helicopter ferried 150 tonnes of fresh chalk, quarried in south Wiltshire, to the horse, giving it a fresh coat in time for its 2012 bicentenary anniversary. As parish councillor Steve Hepworth, who worked on the project, explained, the helicopter was necessary as lorries were not allowed to transport chalk, because the horse stands \\"in the middle of a Site of Special Scientific Interest on a national nature reserve with European protection. Natural England controls the management of the land and as part of that management there is no vehicular access.\\" In July and August 2019, the horse was scoured by a group of hundreds of people from many nations, using some 46 tonnes of pristine chalk flown in by an RAF Chinook helicopter. Led by Rob Sutherland, the work was initially hampered by driving rain and high winds, but the scouring was completed with help from local school students and their parents. Modern history One of the best known white horse hill figures in Wiltshire, Alton Barnes White Horse \\"remains a prominent landmark visible from the Pewsey Vale,\\"Wilts. Tracts, 140/14, The Grey Chape, 'White Horse of Alton Barnes'; W.A.M. xiv. 27‚Äì8. and has been described as being \\"well-loved.\\" It features in the 1995 music video for \\"Staying Out for the Summer\\" by British band Dodgy, and in numerous artworks, including one by landscape artist Anna Dillon and another painted in 1996 by Graham Arnold which is housed in Wiltshire Museum. In the neighbouring village of Alton Priors, there is a sarsen stone with the design of the Alton Barnes White Horse carved into it. The white horse is part of several tours, including the 90-mile walking tour 'Wiltshire's White Horse Trail', better known as simply the White Horse Trail, which visits all eight of the canonical white horses in Wiltshire. On 10 May 2011, the hill became the starting point for the record- breaking longest hand-gliding flight recorded in the UK. =Celebrations= From 2001 to 2012, the white horse was annually illuminated every Winter Solstice by the Wiltshire Crop Circle Study Group, typically on the actual day of the solstice (21 December), except in 2003 when it was not lit at all. This was achieved by a small group of people placing tea lights in jars and arranging them around the outline of the white horse. For example, over 400 candles and jars were used in 2009. Melanie Gambrill, one of the events' organisers, said \\"it must be amazing to watch the horse being lit from a distance, as the lighting progresses up to the horse's head, along the tail until its completely aglow.\\" In 2001, the jars were placed on their sides to provide protection from the wind and rain, and the effect was described as \\"dramatic\\" as the horse continued to be lit late into the evening despite the wind extinguishing a few of the lights. In 2009, the horse was covered in snow when it was illuminated, leading to a \\"quite spectacular\\" effect. On 30 June 2012, in a temporary art installation by Dave Chadwick and Yorkshire-based art group pa-BOOM, the white horse was lit up in a lantern parade to celebrate the horse's 200th anniversary, and also as part of the Ageas Salisbury International Arts Festival; the nearby Devizes White Horse was also lit in a lantern parade at the same time. Maria Bota, the organiser of the event, said \\"I came to the county four years ago and discovered these white horses scattered around the landscape - often in beautiful settings. What we want to do is put a bit of a spotlight on them and enable people to discover them and discover the landscape they're set in.\\" Approximately 100 spectators watched from Mark Hill as the horse was illuminated in several different fashions, \\"first its body in swirling patterns of brilliant white lights, and then its outline in the warm glow of yellow flame,\\" before finishing in a firework display. =Vandalism= For April Fool's Day in 2003 and 2014, the horse was temporarily transformed into a zebra by pranksters, which in the latter case was achieved by pinning black stripes, made from plastic sheeting, across the horse, and giving the figure a black nose. Many people took photos of the 2014 zebra transformation before the pranksters returned to the hill that evening and removed the additions, unlike in 2003 when the pranksters left landowner Tim Carson to remove the additions. The horse was vandalised in March 2008 when pranksters added a penis to the horse, which, although amusing passing motorists, worried the landowner Tim Carson who scours the horse who was unsure if the damage would be permanent. A local newspaper described the vandalism as turning the horse \\"into a stallion,\\" and described the horse as \\"having gained an extra 'limb'.\\" In October 2019, climate change activist group Extinction Rebellion created a piece of \\"flash art\\" by placing an extinction symbol made from old T-shirts on the horse. Critics felt the stunt was \\"disrespectful\\" to the horse, with Wiltshire Council leader Philip Whitehead criticising it on Twitter, while others defended it and spoke of its temporary nature. The group said they intended to remove the symbol without trace by daybreak, saying in a Facebook post: \\"Let‚Äôs be clear, this was by no means an illegal act. We did not vandalise nor deface what is a beautiful chalk monument on the soil of our local community. We too love the White Horse, and it is because of that love that we chose to do it.\\" See also *Alton Barnes *Hill figure ;Wiltshire white horses *Pewsey White Horse *Cherhill White Horse *Westbury White Horse *Marlborough White Horse *Broad Town White Horse *Hackpen White Horse *Devizes White Horse References Category:White horses in England Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Wiltshire Category:Tourist attractions in Wiltshire Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1812 Category:History of Wiltshire Category:Protected areas of Wiltshire ","title":"Alton Barnes White Horse"},{"id":"33021797","text":"M√†nran is a 2011 album, the debut LP by Scottish Celtic rock band M√†nran.

They released an album in 1980 on the label EMI. The band were influenced and inspired by Kraftwerk, Roxy Music and 'Berlin period' David Bowie. Live gigs saw the band covering such songs as Iggy Pop's \\"Funtime\\" and \\"Sister Midnight\\" and Kraftwerk's \\"The Model\\" as well as playing their own material. They built up a substantial following of fans, in and around Glasgow, due to their stylish live performances both as support act to bands like fellow Glaswegians Simple Minds, and as headliners in their own right of such venues as Glasgow's famous Mars Bar. Positive Noise founder and frontman Ross Middleton was an early fan, enthusing \\"Berlin Blondes are Fireball XL5\\" in a review he wrote of one of their gigs for Sounds (as Maxwell Park). History The original line-up consisted of Steven Bonomi (vocals), Robert Farrell (guitar, synth), David Rudden (bass) and Jim Spender (aka Jim McKinven) (keyboards & synths). The band's sound was enhanced by the use of a drum machine which further added to their \\"Futurist/New Musik\\" tag at the time. They recorded their eponymous album (which was to be called 'Building on the Sand before a last minute change) at Rock City, Shepperton in January 1980. However, before the album's release, Rudden left due to \\"artistic differences\\" with Bonomi and McKinven and was replaced firstly by Russell Barrie for a very brief period in one or two gigs (Barrie is seen dressed in pink on the cover of their single \\"Science\\") and then by Nick Clark from Cuban Heels (Clark is credited on the album, although it was Rudden who played.) David Rudden went on to form Endgames. In early 1980, the single \\"Science\\"/\\"Manikin\\" was released. \\"Manikin\\" was an instrumental version of the album track \\"Mannequin\\" which itself was inspired by Kraftwerk's \\"Showroom Dummies\\". The Mike Thorne produced album Berlin Blondes was released much later in the year (September 1980) along with the single \\"Framework\\"/\\"Zero Song\\". However, sales did not live up to expectations and the band was dropped from the label. Trouser Press reviewed the album (years after its original release) and rather haughtily describes it as \\"undistinguished, danceable hybrid synth/bass/drums clich√©s, occasionally adding colorful Sparks-like vocals for character.\\"Berlin Blondes (Ira Robbins, Trouser Press) In truth, Bonomi's vocal style owed much more to Bryan Ferry and Cockney Rebel (Judy Teen era) than it did to Russell Mael. Many fans believed the album did not capture the power of the band's live performances whilst Robert Farrell stated that (as it was one of the first 'Futurist/New Musik' albums released) people were \\"not ready for it\\". Their last incarnation saw them adding drummer Brian MillerBerlin Blondes (Louisa Hennessey, ZigZag July 1981, p26) and bassist Alasdair Gowans and releasing their last single \\"Marseille\\"/\\"The Poet\\" on independent label Scratch Records in 1981 before finally disbanding indefinitely.

The following year, he had mid- and late-season auditions with Detroit as a relief pitcher, working in 19 games. Although he failed to record a decision or a save, McRae had some success, allowing 26 hits in 31‚Öì innings pitched and fashioning a 2.87 earned run average ‚Äî although he issued more bases on balls (25) than he had strikeouts (16).

The trade was a boon for the Tigers, and a catastrophe for the Senators. McLain, just two years removed from winning 31 games for the world champion 1968 Tigers (and one year after notching 24 victories for Detroit's 1969 club), had been suspended for much of the 1970 season by Commissioner of Baseball Bowie Kuhn on gambling allegations and had won only three of eight decisions.

She is best known for her play Possum Paddock (1919). The talented Howarde also played a part in numerous roles as a playwright in over 10 plays from 1914-1938. She was the first Australian woman to direct a feature film.'Australian Female Filmmakers' at Australia.gov.au  Early and personal life  Howarde, was born on 28 July 1864 to parents Edward George Jones and Harriett Hannah in England before migrating to New Zealand as a child. Kate married her first husband William Henry de Saxe who was a musician; the pair married in Christchurch, New Zealand on 28 April 1884. The couple had one child together, Florence Adrienne (born 5 December 1884). Years went by and Saxe and Howarde separated. The registry has no exact dates when she separated from her first husband. On 26 November 1904, the Kate Howarde Dramatic Theatre company opened for a season at Perth's Theatre Royal, the line up included Scottish comedian and singer Elton Black, the pair hit it off and the two were later married. Records do not show how long Black had been in the country prior to the pair getting married. Shortly after, in May 1905, the pair set their sights for America and remained overseas for some four and a half years. Howarde died from cerebral thrombosis on 18 February 1939.  Career  The late 1890s saw big things for Howarde when she adopted the stage name Kate Howarde; she began touring Australia and performing in different settings such as tents and halls. She formed a company which consisted of her two younger brothers and her sister. Kate Howarde and her company continued touring Australia and New Zealand up until 1905. The company was involved in such things as occasionally staged pantomimes and burlesques some of which included Sinbad the Sailor (1897), Little Jack Sheppard, Aladdin and Diavolo. Howarde's big break came with the play Possum Paddock which was released in 1919. The play was written, produced and presented by Howarde. The play brought such success she decided to turn it into a film, which she also starred in, produced, co-directed and co-scripted along with Charles Villiers. This was the first Australian feature film to be co-directed by a woman, making Howarde a female pioneer within the emerging Australian film industry. The film was set to be released on 29 January 1921. The success of Possum Paddock gained her stardom in the business which led to a 10-month tour across several companies. Howarde did not make any more films but continued to write many more plays with her company which were also great success, the last play she wrote was Judgement of jean Calvert before her death in 1939.

Plot In Guyra, New South Wales, the Bowen family are visited by ghosts. Sherlock Doyle, an expert in ghosts, goes to the town to investigate. Cast *John Cosgrove as Sherlock Doyle *Nellie Regan *Minnie Bowen *the Bowen family Original Mystery In April 1921, the family of William Bowen in Guyra reported knocking on the walls and stones being thrown on their roof. This continued even when police and volunteers guarded the house. A friend of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, then touring Australia, visited to help investigate. One of the children, Minnie Bowen, later confessed to throwing some stones and it is thought that practical jokers were behind it, but the mystery was never completely solved. Production The story became a media sensation in 1921 and several film projects based on it were announced but this was the only one made. It was partly funded by a Guyra exhibitor and shot on location in the town. Cosgrove reportedly arrived in the town in May 1921, accompanied by a cameraman, and approached the Bowens directly asking for their co operation in making the film. They were reluctant at first but eventually agreed. The Bowen family themselves appear in the cast. The character of Sherlock Doyle was a spoof of Mr Moors, a friend of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

Synopsis A repentant porn addict enlists the aid of his filmmaker friend and his Porn Addicts Anonymous sponsor in hopes of convincing both the judge and his ex-wife that he's given up smut once and for all in this mockumentary featuring Kenny Vs. Spenny star Spencer Rice. Once upon a time, Mark Tobias (Rice) had a loving wife and a good job - but that all went away thanks to his all-consuming addiction to hardcore pornography. Abandoned by his wife Felicity (Lindsey Connell), who eventually got fed up with the competition, Mark subsequently fell into a downward spiral that culminated with his arrest for indecent exposure at a local video store. These days Mark is a member of Porn Addicts Anonymous. With the help of his sponsor Bob (Mark Breslin) and his filmmaker friend Dunx (Duncan Christie), Mark is doing his best to convince the judge that he's finally free from the grip of addiction. In order to conquer his demons once and for all, Mark sets his sights on the San Fernando Valley - the throbbing epicenter of the entire pornography industry. Later, an unlikely porn star dispatches Mark on an undercover mission into this porn paradise, where he comes face to face with not only his personal demons, but notorious smut peddler Rob Black as well.

Description The wingspan is about . Adults are on wing in July in one generation per year. The larvae feed on greater wood-rush (Luzula sylvatica) mining the leaves of their host plant. Young larvae create a very narrow mine running parallel to the midrib. The mine then suddenly widens to almost the full width of the leaf. The frass is deposited in the transition area between the mine types. Pupation takes place outside of the mine. They are greenish black with a pale honey coloured head. Larvae can be found from autumn to mid-June of the following year. Distribution The moth has been found in Great Britain and Romania. It might also occur in the Netherlands.

It was also a venue for recreation until it dried up in 1950. Hundreds of wells drilled into the Floridan Aquifer may have caused the demise of the springs. Its site is located near the northern end of Peace River, approximately 3/4 mile east of U.S. Highway 17 and 4 miles south of Florida SR 60 / south of Bartow. History Kissengen's springwater rose from the Floridan Aquifer at the rate of 20 million gallons a day.Kissengen Spring Dry Since 1950 Kissengen Spring was once a second magnitude spring. In 1886, the Burr family moved near the spring to farm.1886 Burr Family and Kissingen Springs Increased groundwater withdrawal, beginning in the late 1930s, lowered the potentiometric surface of the aquifers. Kissengen Spring gradually ceased flowing. The spring was publicly declared inactive in 1950 as the result of overpumpage. Until 1950, tourists used the area for picnicking, boating, and swimming.Kissingen Spring Was Spot For FunFlorida Archive Photos There was a pavilion for parties and dancing.

The Polk County Museum had a Historical Marker Ceremony in August 2011. The marker has now been placed at the Mosaic Peace River Park.

This is a problem in restoring flow to the springs.The Spring Vent Plugged with Clay Flow changes along upper Peace River =Florida aquifers= The Floridan aquifer underlies portions of five states. Source: USGS Most spring water comes from the Floridan aquifer.Florida Aquifers This water enters the aquifer from local groundwater recharge areas that include the Lake Wales Ridge and other relict islands to the east and north. The water is under pressure and this force pushes water out of spring vents. =Peace River= Kissingen Spring used to discharge of water into Peace River. The river had a year-round flow. Decreases in the spring's water pressure caused large sinks to reverse the flow and these sinks would received water from the riverbed. Water flows into openings to the underground karst conduits.Peace River Is Sometimes Dry And Flows Underground Find Picture Of Water Gauge Being Placed In The Mud Image of the entire surface water flow of the Alapaha River near Jennings, Florida going into a sinkhole leading to the Floridan Aquifer groundwater.

This stream and its watershed have been altered from their natural state. Role of government Water regulation did not start until the early 1960s. The Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) protects natural resources, including springs.Department of Environmental Protection The Southwest Florida Water Management District has developed a plan to restore waterflow to Kissingen Springs.South Water Use Caution Area Recovery Strategy Restoration It is not known whether the water shortage at Kissengen Spring is real and permanent, or the result of a period of lower than average rainfall coupled with decades of pre-regulatory overdrafting of the aquifer. Streamflow changes along upper Peace River There is a project to raise the level of Lake Hancock and start a larger flow towards Peace River.Lake Hancock Project To restore Kissengen Spring, the aquifer must be recharged with enough water to recreate the original spring pressure. Peace River will have to be restored to the year round minimal flow. During May, much of the upper Peace River goes dry. This dry period is hindering the aquifer recharge and revitalzation of Kissengen Spring. The intent of these two projects is to increase the clean flow of Peace River and recharge the aquifer around the Kissengen Spring area. =Lake Hancock Outfall Wetland Project= The Lake Hancock Outfall Wetland Project (LHOWP) is a large-scale, flow-through, wetland to improve the quality of water that discharges from Lake Hancock to Saddle Creek and ultimately to the Peace River and Charlotte Harbor. The project site is located adjacent to and south of Lake Hancock in Bartow, Polk County, Florida. The finished project is expected to consist of a treatment wetland located on former reclaimed phosphate mine clay settling areas now owned by the Southwest Florida Water Management District. On the south end of Lake Hancock is a structure called P-11. It can be raised or lowered to control the level of water in Lake Hancock. Water will be pumped from the southern shore of the lake through three wetland cells. The cells will incorporate narrow planting strips separated by larger natural recruitment zones. The treated water will discharge from the Cell 3 wetland outfall structure into Lower Saddle Creek, which is downstream of the lake outfall structure (P-11). The project includes construction of an inlet pump station, instrumentation, controls, control structures, earthwork, embankment, slurry cut-off wall, channels, aeration structure and access road. The plan is to raise the level of the lake about and making the lake a natural storage area for water. The result would increase flow into the Peace River. Part of the project is to filter the water through marsh areas before releasing it. Peace River has several openings into the karst conduits and millions of gallons of water flow underground instead of down the riverbed. This project will attempt to create berms around these holes and limit the amount of water being lost. The water cannot be directly discharged into Peace River because of the polluted condition of the water.

The score is an index which takes into account the correlative and causal relationship between mortality and factors including advancing age, burn size, the presence of inhalational injury. Studies have shown that the Baux score is highly correlative with length of stay in hospital due to burns and final outcome. Methods =Original method= The original Baux score was the addition of two factors, the first being the total body surface area affected by burning (usually estimated using the Wallace rule of nines, or calculated using a Lund and Browder chart) and the second being the age of the patient. The score is expressed as: :\\\\text{Baux score} = \\\\text{(percent body surface burned)} + \\\\text{(patient's age)} The score is a comparative indicator of burn severity, with a score over 140 considered as being unsurvivable, depending on the available treatment resources. =Modified method= Research demonstrated that with improvements in medical care rendered the original method too pessimistic in its outcome prediction. This resulted in the publication of a modified methodology which took into account the effect of inhalation injury. It was found that inhalation injury resulted in an increase of around 17 on the Baux score, and this addition means that a patient with inhalation injury would have their score calculated by body area affected + age of patient + 17. Recent analysis of mortality in burn units worldwide has shown that for well performing units the LD50 (the point at which 50% of patients would be expected to die) for major burns has significantly improved and the best units have a modified Baux score of 130-140. This means that all burns in children (except 100% TBSA full-thickness burns) should be considered survivable injuries and actively treated. Efficacy Studies have shown Baux score to be effective in measuring comparative severity of burn injuries, and in predicting the prognosis for the patient. The modified version, which includes inhalation injuries, is more accurate than the original method, although neither method is as accurate as more complex calculated scores using advanced computer modelling. The Baux score has been shown to be effective in predicting outcome in 87% of presenting patients aged 60 and above.

In the film, two teenage girls cause their respective parents much concern when they start to become interested in boys. The parents' bickering about which girl is the worse influence causes more problems than it solves. The movie was based on the Broadway play Kiss and Tell, which was based on the Corliss Archer short stories. The stories, play and movie were all written by F. Hugh Herbert. A sequel film, A Kiss for Corliss, was released in 1949 and also starred Temple, but was not written by Herbert. Plot When their booth at a USO bazaar fails to attract customers, teenager Corliss Archer suggests to her best friend, Mildred Pringle, that they sell kisses. The idea becomes a success among the soldiers visiting the bazaar, and business is booming, until the girls' mothers find out about it. Despite the fact that it was Corliss' idea, Mrs. Archer blames Mildred for the girls' behavior. Mrs. Archer's assumptions greatly upset Mr. Pringle when he hears about them at the Pringle dinner table. He decides the family, including Mildred and their son Raymond, will refrain from socializing with the Archers in the future. That same night, Corliss pretends to be older than she is and starts flirting shamelessly with young Private Jimmy Earhart, who has been invited into the Archer home for dinner. Corliss is actually dating the boy next door, Dexter Franklin. Late that night, Lenny Archer returns home on a short leave from his Air Force service. He goes directly to his girlfriend Mildred and proposes to her, suggesting they elope and marry right away, before he is shipped off overseas. By the next morning the couple has married across the state line. They go home to inform their respective families about their activities and plans, but find that the Pringles and the Archers are no longer on speaking terms since the feud has intensified. Lenny only tells his sister Corliss of what they have done, and makes her swear not to tell anyone. The feud gets worse when Mr. Pringle and Mr. Archer start a fist fight and punch each other in the face. The injuries from the fight result in lawsuits from both families against each other. The feud drags on for months. Eventually Mildred finds out that she is pregnant, and she goes to see an obstetrician. Corliss goes with her, and is spotted by Mrs. Wilcox, the town gossip. Corliss is seen talking to Jimmy on the street, directly after leaving the doctor's office, and Mrs. Wilcox instantly and eagerly passes the information on to Mrs. Pringle. Mrs. Pringle sees her chance to get back at the Archers, so she confronts them with the claim that Corliss is pregnant and that Jimmy is the father. Corliss doesn't want Mildred and her brother to get into trouble, so she admits to being pregnant. When Mrs. Archer tries to call Jimmy's superior officer to scold him, Corliss says Dexter is the father. Then she intercepts her mother by telling Dexter what she has said, asking him to help her out by lying. Corliss tries to soften the blow for her parents by lying again, telling them that she and Dexter are already married. Mr. Archer doesn't believe her, so she tells him they were married across the state line. When Mr. Archer calls the justice who performed the ceremony, the man confirms that an Archer was married there months ago. Soon the Franklins are informed of their son's endeavours, and both families gather at Archer's house. Uncle George Archer, who is a Navy chaplain, insists on performing another, \\"proper\\" wedding ceremony for the young couple. The same night, Mildred hears news that Lenny has performed heroically in the war, and is coming home soon, whereupon she summons the courage to tell her family about her marriage and pregnancy. She also tells her mother about Corliss going with her to the doctor, which makes Mrs. Archer realize Mrs. Wilcox was wrong. The Pringles run over to tell the news to the Archers, and enters the house to the music of the wedding march. Mr. Archer chases Mr. Pringle out the door and down the street, but soon finds out that they are both to be grandparents. The two families finally reconcile.

Retrieved on May 15, 2013. \\"55 Yangjae-Dong, Sucho-Gu, Seoul 137-889, Korea\\" It was formerly called Torch Trinity Graduate School of Theology (TTGST). The university commits itself to the cause of Christian missions, with an emphasis on training future leaders of the church from all over the world. Historyhttp://www.ttgu.ac.kr (Home > About Torch Trinity > History). Torch Trinity Graduate University was established in 1997 through the partnership of the Korean Center for World Missions (Seoul, South Korea) and Trinity Evangelical Divinity School(Deerfield, IL). Torch Trinity first opened its doors in 1998 with the purpose of educating, equipping, and sending Christian leaders and missionaries worldwide. Originally named Torch Trinity Graduate School of Theology (TTGST), the establishment of the school was pioneered by Hyung Ja Lee. She was installed as the school's chairperson in 1997 and still holds this office today. Since its establishment, Torch Trinity has had four presidents. Jung-Sook Lee (2015‚Äìpresent), Sang Bok David Kim (1997-2001, 2011‚Äì2015), Kenneth M. Meyer (2001-2005), and Yong Jo Ha (2005-2011). After the sudden passing of President Ha,Kim Yoon-mi, \\"Onnuri Church Founder Ha Dies,\\" The Korean Herald, August 2, 2011, http://www.koreaherald.com/lifestyle/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20110802000533 (accessed February 14, 2012). the founding president, Sangbok David Kim, was reappointed as the fourth president (2011‚Äì2015). Under his leadership, the school changed its English appellation to Torch Trinity Graduate University to reflect a more accurate translation of the school's Korean name and added the Academic Building with new classrooms. Jung Sook Lee, the former vice president of Academic Development, was installed as the fifth president on September 1, 2015. Torch Trinity is an evangelical, interdenominational institution. The Torch Trinity student body is drawn from the traditions of various Protestant denominations including Reformed/Presbyterian, Baptist, Independent Bible, Methodist, Pentecostal, and Episcopalian. Currently, there are over five hundred students enrolled at Torch Trinity from over thirty countries.[4] [5] The school offers six degree programs instructed by twenty- six full-time professors and thirteen adjuncts each with a doctoral degree from an accredited school. Students can choose to join either the English or Korean language programs. Art Gallery Opening Aims Strategic Mission Education and Adaptive Education: The school has adopted the \\"Strategic Mission and Adaptive Education\\" plan to meet four areas of the church today: * Mission Fields * Korean Churches * Foreign Residents in Korea * Foreign Nationals of Korean Descent Torch Trinity scholarships are given to students who help fulfill the school's aims. One of the most sought after scholarships includes the Torch Strategic Mission Scholarship (TSMS) which includes full tuition, room and board. Here, recipients are from the Majority World and they are called to serve in their respective countries upon graduation. TSMS is an integral part of Torch Trinity's mission to train and equip Christian leaders for those regions least penetrated by the gospel. Angel Projects: Between semesters, members of the faculty take groups of students to visit alumni. These trips are called Angel Projects. Professors often give seminars on their specialized topics while students are able to learn first-hand how Christians propagate the gospel in a global context. Torch Trinity endeavors to stay connected to its graduates for mutual edification and to better learn how to meet the needs of Christians abroad.http://www.ttgu.ac.kr (Home > About Torch Trnity > Features of TTGU). Academicshttp://www.ttgu.ac.kr (Home > Programs). = Degree programs = Torch Trinity offers six degree programs: MDiv, MEd, MA (in Christian Counseling and in Christian Education), MTS, ThM, and PhD. Both Korean citizens and foreign/international students can apply. Expatriates living in Korea can also apply for a degree program as part-time students (if they apply full-time, they will be categorized as internationals). Torch Trinity holds classes during the day and evening. The following degrees and tracks are taught in English: The Master of Divinity (MDiv) is a 3-year program that prepares graduates for pastoral, preaching, and teaching ministries either in the church or in the mission field. It offers a comprehensive study of the Bible, including the biblical languages (Hebrew and Greek), theology, church history, preaching and practical ministry, mission and evangelism, Christian education, and Christian counseling. The MDiv is the minimum degree for ordination in most denominations and for entry into PhD or ThD programs in theological studies. The Master of Education (MEd) is a 2-year program for full-time students and is geared for students who wish to work in primary or secondary schools. It has two tracks: Instruction and Administration. MEd students can also earn ACSI certification. The Master of Arts (MA) is a 2-year program designed to prepare graduates for professional ministry in either education or counseling. Both Christian Counseling and Christian Education programs fall under this degree. The MA begins with biblical and theological foundations and ends with practical/clinical training and experience. Writing a thesis is optional. The Master of Theological Studies (MTS) is a 2-year program designed to provide a comprehensive survey of biblical studies, theology, and church history. Applied studies are available as electives. The MTS does not require biblical languages (Hebrew and Greek) or preaching. This degree does not usually qualify students for pastoral ordination. The Master of Theology (ThM) is a 2-year advanced program for MDiv graduates to develop a high degree of competency in a specific field of specialization. Concentrations are available from all departments except Counseling. The degree is often viewed as a stepping-stone for doctoral studies and is thus ideal for a more rigorous and academic study of a specific area of biblical, theological, historical, or applied studies. The ThM program requires either a thesis or two major academic papers. Doctoral programs more readily accept ThM over MDiv graduates. The Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) is a research terminal degree. Torch Trinity offers doctorates in four areas: Biblical Studies, Theological/Historical studies, Intercultural Studies, and Educational Studies. The PhD is a 3-year doctoral program for academic research, publication, and teaching ministries. Graduates will gain competence in a highly specialized area for the purpose of advanced research and publication as well as a comprehensive knowledge of the discipline for teaching at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels. The PhD requires a rigorous doctoral dissertation. = Accreditation = Torch Trinity is accredited by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, which is the only accrediting agency in the Republic of Korea. Internationally, the school is accredited by the Asia Theological Association (ATA), an Asian accrediting body. Credits can be transferred in full to any school accredited by the Association of Theological Schools (ATS) in North America. Torch Trinity graduates have been accepted for doctoral programs in the United States and the United Kingdom. Torch Trinity is also a member of the Korea Association of Accredited Theological Schools (KAATS). The U.S. military G.I. Bill recognizes the school, allowing veterans to earn a graduate degree on the Korean peninsula. In addition, Torch Trinity's alumni can also become military chaplains. = Student awards and prizes = Among its student awards, the Torch Trinity awards a prize for Excellence in Preaching and a prize for Excellence in Writing in honor of the American theologian and author Frederick Buechner. A judging panel of faculty members and peers adjudicate the contest, and the prizes are awarded to those submissions that demonstrate excellence in these areas.Ha Yong Jo Chapel Foyer Library The Torch Trinity Library is the academic resource center for the school and provides abundant material for students to study and browse in a quiet, comfortable environment.

Burns wrote more than a dozen books and scholarly works on the Osage people. In 2002 he was inducted into the Oklahoma Historians Hall of Fame. Biography =Early life and marriage= Burns was born on January 2, 1920, in Elgin, Kansas, to Robert Lee and Bessie (n√©e Tinker) Burns. His mother, Bessie, an Osage allottee, was a member of the prominent Tinker family. Burns chronicled their history in his self-published book, Turn of the Wheel: A Genealogy of the Burns and Tinker Families (1980), which also explores a considerable amount of Osage history. Through her, Burns was descended from the Little Bear/Strike Axe band of Little Osages, and was a member of the tribe's Mottled Eagle Clan. He was one-eighth Osage/Kansas, and his Osage name was Hulah Kiheka (Eagle Chief). He became a member of the I‚Äôn Lon Schka Society, which organizes the important ceremonial dance. Burns was raised on a cattle ranch within the Osage Nation. During World War II, Burns served in the United States Marine Corps in the Central and South Pacific Campaigns. Soon after returning to the United States from the war, he married Ruth Blake in 1945. =Career= Burns received both a bachelor's degree in education and a master's degree in history from Kansas State Teachers College at Emporia. (Since 1977 and expansion of programs, the college has been known as Emporia State University). He later worked on a doctorate at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. Burns graduated from the Spartan College of Aeronautics and Technology, a private aeronautical college in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He worked for the Lockheed Corporation in California and Beech Aircraft in Wichita, Kansas, during the course of his career. In addition to work in the aeronautical industry, Burns also held positions as an educator and lecturer. He taught high school in the communities of Shawnee Mission, Kansas, and Santa Ana, California. He served as an instructor and lecturer at his alma mater, Emporia State University, and Santiago Community College in Orange County, California. =Osage historian= Burns wrote 13 books on the history, culture, and mythology of the Osage Nation. His best- known work, A History of the Osage People (1989), included material from much of his earlier research and publications. Burns also contributed research as a columnist, feature writer, and editor. He wrote for the Osage Nation News and Inside Osage as a feature writer. He also contributed numerous articles on the Osage to the Chronicles of Oklahoma. Burns served as the editor of two educational newsletters. He presented scholarly papers for the Plains Indian Seminars at the Buffalo Bill Historical Center in Wyoming in 1989, 1992 (his paper \\"Missionaries, Fur Traders, and Osage Ribbon Work\\" was published in The Artist and the Missionary: Proceedings of the 1992 Plains Indian Seminar), 1997, and 1999. In each case the proceedings were published. He presented papers at the Oklahoma Historical Society in 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999, and the Missouri Valley Historical Society in 1996 in Omaha. He also collected artifacts from Osage history. Burns donated much of his collection to the Osage Nation Museum in Pawhuska, Oklahoma. Burns also contributed extensively to the Oklahoma Historical Society. His donations to the Historical Society are housed in a new, purpose-built wing at the White Hair Memorial in Ralston, Oklahoma. Burns died at his home in Pawhuska, Oklahoma, on May 20, 2010, at the age of 92. He was buried at Pawhuska City Cemetery with both U.S. military honors and traditional Osage customs and rites. Burns was survived by his two children, Keith Burns and Alice (Burns) Thomas. His wife, Ruth, died in 2006 after 61 years of marriage. In a dedication to her in one of his books, Burns said his wife was, \\"My best friend and harshest critic.\\" The director of the Osage Nation Museum, Kathryn Red Corn, described Burns' death as a loss for the Osage Nation, saying, \\"He will truly be missed by the Osage people...Mr. Burns was a good friend to our museum. He was a repository of tribal history.\\" Works  Burns' research materials are housed by the University of Arkansas at Little Rock in the Sequoyah Research Center of the American Native Press Archives. The University of Arkansas' Louis F. Burns Collection has papers related to his scholarly research, which spanned more than fifty years.\\"Louis F.

The species was first formally described by botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in 1886 in the Australian Journal of Pharmacy. The species name honours one George Macrae, who aided the original collector William Baeuerlen. Hakea macraeana grows as a shrub or small tree anywhere from 1 to 7.5 or 10 m (4‚Äì25 (35) ft) tall, and has drooping branches and needle-like leaves, which range from long, and are soft but tipped with a sharp point. The white or cream-white inflorescences appear along the stems from August to October, and are composed of two to six individual small flowers. Flowering is followed by the development of oval- shaped woody seed pods. Warty and brown, they are long and wide. Each contains two dark grey or dark brown seeds which are long and bear a membranous \\"wing\\". The range is the south coast and southern tablelands of New South Wales to altitudes of . A population from Dorrigo in northern New South Wales has since been classified as a separate species H. ochroptera. Hakea macraeana is an understory plant of sclerophyll forest on rocky soils. The species' response to bushfire is unknown. Rarely cultivated, the willow needlewood has potential as a screening plant. It adapts readily to cultivation and is tolerant of light or heavy soils. Faring better in climates of over annual rainfall, Hakea macraeana is tolerant of moderate frosts.

See also: Google translate.  The Hummel Castle  The focus of the Lordship of Hummel was (the no-longer existing) Hummel Castle, located on a mountain above the valley of the Bystrzyca Dusznicka river, approximately 3 km west of Duszniki Zdr√≥j (Du≈°n√≠ky, Bad Reinerz). Due to its geographical location, it secured the important road from Prague via the Hummel Pass to K≈Çodzko (Kladsko, Glatz) and Wroc≈Çaw (Breslau, Vratislav), the so-called Poland Route. Hummel Castle was called in until the 15th century. In 1427, it was conquered by the Hussites, who used it as a base for their attacks on Kladsko Land and neighbouring Silesia. During this period, the German name Landfried was replaced by the Czech name Homole. After 1560 the castle was uninhabited and dilapidated. Elector Palatine Otto Henry, Elector Palatine had sketches of the castle made during his journey from Neuburg an der Donau to Cracow in 1536. These sketches are the only surviving pictures of the castle before its destruction.  History of the Lordship of Hummel  In the 10th century, Hummel was part of the territory of the Slavn√≠k dynasty. In 995, it was acquired by the P≈ôemyslid dynasty. Back then, the Lordship of Hummel consisted only of the eastern part of the later Hummel district, that is, the watershed of the Bystrzyca Dusznicka river, with the town of Duszniki Zdr√≥j and a number of villages (present-dayS≈Çosz√≥w, Ociesz√≥w, Bystra, ≈Åƒô≈ºyce, Szczytna, Kulin K≈Çodzki and Dolina). In the 14th century, the Lordship was held by the Lords of Pannwitz. After the transfer to Dƒõt≈ôich of Janovice (1392‚Äì1411), Hummel was united with the neighbouring Lordship of N√°chod. In 1412, the lordships came into the possession of Henry of La≈æany, who traded Hummel and N√°chod in 1414 with Boƒçek II of Podƒõbrady (d. 1417) for the city and lordship of Bechynƒõ in southern Bohemia. Boƒçek's son Victor, who was a staunch supporter of the Utraquists, died in 1427. The Taborites then conquered Hummel Castle, and used it as a base for their incursions into Kladsko/Glatz and Silesia. The Lordship of Hummel was ruled jointly by the Taborite captains Jan Hol√Ω and Mikul√°≈° Trƒçka z L√≠py. In 1440, the castle came into the hands of the Taborite robber baron Jan Kolda of ≈Ωampach. From 1444 to 1454, the Lordship belonged to Hynek Kru≈°ina of Lichtenburg, who was also the lien holder of the County of Kladsko/Glatz. After his death, the Lordship was acquired by George of Podƒõbrady (later King of Bohemia), who appointed V√°clav Hol√Ω as Burgrave of Hummel Castle. In 1458, George transferred the Lordship to his sons Boƒçek IV (d. 1496) and Victor. After George's deaths in 1471, his sons divided the family possessions, with Henry the Elder receiving the Lordships of Hummel and N√°chod. In 1477, Henry the Elder enfeoffed the Lordship to Hildebrand of Kauffung and made it administratively part of Kladsko/Glatz, which had been made a County in 1459. At the same time the Bohemian parishes Lewin K≈Çodzki (Lev√≠n) and (ƒåermn√°, Tscherbeney) were incorporated into the Lordship of Hummel. The villages of S≈Çone (Schlaney) and Brzesowie, that did not belong to the parish of Czermna, but to the parish of St. Lawrence in N√°chod, were also incorporated into the Lordship. From this time onwards, the original, eastern part of Hummel was termed the \\"German\\" side and the western part was termed the \\"Bohemian\\" side. After the devastations of the Hussite Wars, the villages of the Bohemian side were also settled anew by German-speakers, making the whole Lordship in majority German- speakingJaroslav ≈†≈Øla: Jm√©na obyvatel homolsk√©ho panstv√≠ v XVI. a XVII. stolet√≠ jako doklad etnicity obyvatel regionu.

Under Sigismund of Kauffung, the castle again became a hideout for robber barons. In 1501, Ulrich of Hardegg bought the County of Kladsko/Glatz, including the Lordship of Hummel. In 1537, his son pledged it to John III of Pernstein,Erwerb durch Johann von Pernstein whose son Vratislav II of Pernstein inherited the Lordship in 1548. In 1459, the County of Kladsko/Glatz, including the Lordship of Hummel, was sold to Ernest of Bavaria of the House of Wittelsbach. On 10 December 1459, Ernest gave the Lordship of Hummel to his illegitimate son Eustace. In 1550, Eustace was ennobled by Emperor Charles V as Eustace of Landfried. Eustace was legitimized as a noble son of Ernest by Pope Julius II. Eustace sold the Lordship after Ernest's death to Ernst Gelhorn von und zu Alten Greckau und Roge. In 1590, the Lordship was acquired by Rudolf of Stubenberg, who pledged it to the city of Reinerz (present-day Duszniki Zdr√≥j) in 1595.  Dissolution of the Lordship  The Lordship was dissolved in 1598. Rudolf of Stubenberg acquired most of the land the belonged to the castle estate. Most of the towns and villages ware assigned to the Bohemian Chamber (Treasure Office for management of royal assets). Several of them were sold to the city of Reinerz and the Lordship of R√ºckers by Emperor Leopold I in 1684, to defray the cost of the Great Turkish War.

Georg von Siemens was on the board of directors of the Deutsche Bank from 1870 to 1900. One of his top priorities was the financing of international railway projects, including the Northern Pacific, and the Baghdad Railway. From 1874 until his death, he was voted several times to both the Prussian House of Representatives and the German Reichstag. Until 1880, he represented the National Liberal Party, then the Secession, from 1884 to 1893 the German Free-minded Party, and for the last years the Free-minded Union.  Background  Georg von Siemens was born on 21 October 1839 to judicial officer Johann Siemens and Marie Siemens (n√©e von Sperl) in Torgau. Siemens was a nephew of industrialists Werner von Siemens, William, and Carl von Siemens. His father provided most of the funds of the later Siemens AG. In 1857, Siemens began studying law in Heidelberg just before beginning his one- year military service in Berlin in 1858. After passing his state examination in 1860, Siemens worked as a clerk for the district courts in J√ºterbog and Zossen. After transferring to Aachen in 1866, Siemens began advising the company of Werner Siemens, his cousin, Siemens, Halske & Co. before being drafted into the Rhenish Infantry Regiment for the German War. Siemens became the state examiner for Aachen later that year.  Establishment of the Indo- European Telegraph Company and Deutsche Bank  In 1867, Georg von Siemens established the Indo-European Telegraph Company in London on behalf of Werner Siemens. From 1868‚Äì1870, Siemens worked for the Indo-European Telegraph Company in Tehran, mediating between the British and Persian governments to secure Siemens, Halske & Co. the rights to income from the telegraph traffic. In 1870, Siemens returned to Berlin and participated in the founding of Deutsche Bank. In April of that year, Siemens became the director of Deutsche Bank before being commissioned as a lieutenant of the 4th Brandenburg Infantry Regiment for the Franco-German War. From 1872‚Äì1874, Siemens led the establishment of Deutsche Bank in London, Paris, New York City, Argentina, Uruguay, Shanghai, and Yokohama. The branches in Argentina, Uruguay, Shanghai, and Yokohama were later liquidated due to financial trouble.

Mitochondria can divide by prokaryotic binary fission and since they require mitochondrial DNA for their function, fission is coordinated with DNA replication. Some of the proteins that are involved in mitochondrial fission have been identified and some of them are associated with mitochondrial diseases. Mitochondrial fission has significant implications in stress response and apoptosis. Mechanism The Drp1 protein is a member of the dynamin family of large GTPases. Drp1 controls the final part of mitochondrial fission, pinching off the membrane stalk between two forming daughter mitochondria. The MFN2 protein is part of a complex that links the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to mitochondria. Points of ER-mitochondrial association have been associated with the formation of Drp1 complexes and mitochondrial fission. Several Drp1-binding proteins have been identified. A protein called mitochondrial fission factor (Mff) binds Drp1 and promotes mitochondrial fission. The FIS1 protein might recruit Drp1 to sites of fission but it might require association with another protein, MIEF1 (mitochondrial elongation factor 1) coded for by the SMCR7L gene, to promote mitochondrial fission. In contrast, MIEF1 when bound to Drp1 might prevent mitochondrial fission and thus shift the balance towards fusion of mitochondria. Recent research found that actin polymerization through ER-localized inverted formin 2 (INF2) was required for efficient mitochondrial fission in mammalian cells. INF2 functioned upstream of Drp1. INF2-induced actin filaments may drive initial mitochondrial constriction, which allows Drp1-driven secondary constriction. Cryo-electron tomography has been able to visualize mitochondrial division in frozen hydrated cells and has led to the suggestion that mitochondria divide by budding.

Cut of chalk in 1937, it replaces an earlier horse that had disappeared under the grass and is one of eight remaining white horses in Wiltshire. It measures 66‚Äô by 45‚Äô, making it the smallest of the eight canonical white horse in Wiltshire. When Pewsey White Horse was cut it was the seventh or eighth White Horse in Wiltshire (the confusion arising as Rockley White Horse was unknown until 1948) and the first of the 20th century. It was also one of the smallest. George Marples designed the white horse commemorating the Coronation of George VI, and was inspired by other white horses in Wiltshire. The horse is the most well known landmark in Pewsey, and today it is maintained and scoured by the Pewsey 6X Club, who work under the name Pewsey Horse Restoration Group. Wiltshirewhitehorses.org.uk consider it to be a \\"well-proportioned representation of the real animal.\\" The white horse also features on the Town Flag of Pewsey, whose official registration notes describe the horse as \\"iconic\\".Pewsey, Wiltshire - The Flag Institute Barry Leighton of the Swindon Advertiser describes the horse as standing in a \\"care-free trotting stance.\\" Gazette and Herald have referred to the horse as \\"one of Pewsey's proudest monuments.\\" Origins The horse was cut to commemorate the Coronation of George VI A previous white horse was cut on the same hill, probably in 1785. It was cut by, or on the instructions of, Robert Pile of Manor Farm, Alton Barnes. The nearby Alton Barnes White Horse was cut 27 years later by a Robert Pile of the same address, but is unknown if this is the same man. The horse received a scouring in 1789, believed to be the first and last scouring, as the landowner objected to the festivities which had accompanied the scouring and thus refused to allow it to happen again. Thus, it fell into neglect, and by the mid-1800s was in a bad state of repair. By the mid-1930s, the chalk of the horse was no longer visible. Nonetheless, the outline of the head and body could still vaguely be seen, both as raised contours revealed by both the light of the rising sun and as a discolouration of the grass. As is visible from a sketch of the contours still visible in 1939, the horse may have been of fairly good proportions. A local legend says that the horse had a boy rider, but there appears to have been no visible rider in the late 1800s when the chalk was still able to be seen, so this theory has often been refuted. Had it had a rider, it would have been one of two of such horses to do so in England, alongside the 19th century Osmington White Horse near Weymouth, Dorset. In 1937, George Marples, an authority on hill figures, was in the area researching the horse, which at this time was barely visible, when he was approached by a committee that had just been formed to find a suitable way of commemorating the Coronation of George VI. Marples drew up three designs for a horse and, for ease of maintenance, the horse shown trotting to the left was chosen. (The former Pewsey horse also faced the left, as did all other Wiltshire white horses at the time). Each of his designs showed '1937' above the horse to record the year, as the cutting years of several other horses in Wiltshire were, and still are, unknown. Marples suggested a triangular method for marking out the horse. A sketch of this method is known to still exist. In April 1937 it was cut by volunteers from Pewsey Fire Brigade. Some sources suggest it was cut in late April 1937, whilst others state it was cut in the last few weeks of April 1937. The date '1937' was cut above the horse, however, it appears this number was never later scoured and thus the date is no longer visible. The horse was floodlit in coronation week and the effect was described as \\"very good\\" except for thick fog on two nights. The nearby Cherhill White Horse was also floodlit to mark the occasion.Wiltshire White Horses: Lighting up the horses Notably, the Pewsey horse was cut 99 years after Hackpen White Horse was cut to commemorate the coronation of Queen Victoria, the only other horse in Wiltshire known to commemorate a coronation. Description and location The Pewsey White Horse from a distance The smallest white horse in Wiltshire, Pewsey White Horse is 35 feet tall and 67 feet tall. Pewsey White Horse is cut on private land roughly a mile south of Pewsey Village, on a steep NNW facing slope of Pewsey Hill about 500‚Äô above sea level. Access to the horse is available to visitors. The horse can be seen from along the A345 near Pewsey Village and along the south of the village itself, but the horse is viewed most clearly from the Pewsey to Everleigh road below Pewsey Hill. The figure can be visited from the top of Pewsey Hill where there are footpaths leading to the horse and places where a car may be parked (although not designated parking places). Pewsey Hill is a down (downland, a chalk hill) marking on end of the 19 mile Vale of Pewsey, where others of the white horses are located. Although not itself part of the downs, the vale is part of the North Wessex Downs AONB (Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty). The horse looks out across the Vale of Pewsey towards the Alton Barnes White Horse on Milk Hill. Pewsey White Horse is visible from Milk Hill, near to Alton Barnes White Horse although not from the exact location of that horse. Pewsey White Horse is on the outskirts of the village of Pewsey, but nonetheless is considered to be within the village's boundaries. It is the second and so far final piece of public art in the village, following the King Alfred Monument (1913), which was erected in the centre of the village to commemorate the coronation of George VI's predecessor, George V.King Alfred Monument - Pewsey - Wiltshire - England  British Listed Buildings Modern history The Town Flag of Pewsey. The horse has gradually become slightly larger over time. The figure is fenced in to prevent damage from grazing animals, making this one of four Wiltshire White Horses to be fenced in, alongside Alton Barnes White Horse, Cherhill White Horse and Marlborough White Horse. In either late 1999 or early 2000, an information board was placed above the horse (backed to the fence) giving information on the eight white horses. This was placed after Devizes White Horse had been cut. The edges of the horse are well defined and the chalk is of very small compacted pieces. The horse is maintained and scoured by the Pewsey 6X Club, who work under the name of the Pewsey Horse Restoration Group. The horse is typically re-chalked (or 'scoured') every eight or ten years. One scouring took place in November 1998 and another in spring 2004. The horse was scoured again by a group of almost 15 people in 2017 to commemorate its 80th birthday. The group firstly cleaned the surface off, then removed weeds and moss with sharp hoes and finally placed fresh chalk on the horse which was partially consolidated with hand-held rammers, leaving rainfall to complete the job. The Pewsey Parish Council rewarded the volunteers with glasses of Prosecco. In July 2008, Eqvalan, a parasite paste brand for horses, supported the protection of the white horse as part of their 25th birthday celebrations. Their donation was used to help restore the protective fencing around the horse. In return, Eqvalan were allowed to decorate the horse for a short time as part of their anniversary celebrations, adorning the horse with a party hat and placing bunting inside the protective fence. The white horse was recently covered with grass during the build-up to Pewsey's annual carnival, and then the horse appeared during the procession itself.April fool pranksters turn Alton Barnes horse into zebra (From This Is Wiltshire) The Town Flag of Pewsey, registered with the Flag Institute on 18 September 2014, features an illustration of the Pewsey White Horse in the centre. The flag was designed by Eleanor Taylor, with the flag's dark green hills representing Pewsey's rural farming landscape upon which is charged the White Horse, whilst above the horse is the crown to represent King Alfred, who has a statue in the village centre, the only other public art in Pewsey aside from the white horse, and who once held land in Pewsey. The oak leaves represent the solidity of the village.

It was cut in 1999 to celebrate the forthcoming third millennium, and is based on a design of another white horse hill figure, which was also known as the Devizes White Horse, or sometimes The Snobs Horse, which was very close to the present horse as it was also on Roundway Hill beneath the Oliver's Castle hill fort. Traces of the Snobs Horse can still be seen under the right conditions. The Devizes White Horse is the eighth and latest major white horse hill figure cut in Wiltshire to be seen today, and is long by high. The horse, although sometimes viewed from an skewed angle when on nearby roads, can be seen from miles away, including from Bratton Castle on Bratton Downs, home to Westbury White Horse. It is also visible from the Vale of Pewsey, home to the Pewsey White Horse, where the Devizes White Horse and Alton Barnes White Horse can be seen facing each other. Origins and history =Original Devizes White Horse= Roundway Hill, the west side of which (pictured) was the location to the original Devizes White Horse In 1845, local shoemakers cut a white horse into the west side of Roundway Hill, directly beneath the hill fort, Oliver's Castle. This was a good location for a hill figure, as it overlooked the valley on a steep slope about 600' above sea level, and could be seen from many miles away. It was known locally as the \\"Snobs Horse\\", the word \\"snobs\\" derived from the local word for shoemaker. It was fitting to cut a hill figure of a horse, as by its cutting date in 1845, there were already white horse hill figures visible in 1845 in Wiltshire at Westbury, Alton Barnes, Hackpen, Cherhill, near Inkpen, Marlborough and possibly at Broad Town, whose horse has an unknown origin but probably from the 19th century, and Rockley, whose horse was 'discovered' in 1945, prior to which it had resided under grass. Most of them still exist today, the exceptions being those at Inkpen and Rockley. The Devizes horse was neglected and was lost in about 1922, and no dimensions of the horse seem to have ever existed. However, different colouration of the grass could be seen. In 1954, James Smith, the head boy of the Devizes Grammar School of the time, was out cycling and believed he saw the outline of a horse on the Oliver Cromwell promontory. His observations were checked and indeed there was the faint outline of the head, neck and rump of a horse to be seen. This was the old Snobs Horse. A sketch of the design of the horse was drawn and was later used for the design of the modern 1999 Devizes Millennium White Horse, except reversed, as the Millennium White Horse faces the right (the only white horse in Wiltshire to do so), whilst the Snobs Horse sketch faced left. Attempts to remake the figure at this point in 1954 were unsuccessful, as were previous attempts in 1909, 1939 when the horse was also reported to be seen, 1977, 1987 and finally 1998 when its head and neck reappeared. In 1979, freak lighting conditions and fine snow brought the outline of the horse's neck and head into view for the first time since 1954. The head and neck have been seen regularly since, including in 1998, 2000 and 2005, the latter two times were since the creation of the Millennium White Horse. Whenever any part of it has reappeared it seems to suggest the horse was small, and roughly half the size of the Millennium White Horse. The reason for its regular reappearances is due to its method of construction, trenching, which is by far the most common method of hill figure construction. The underlying chalk was not near the surface so a trench was dug and chalk from another site was used to fill the trench. The reason this method of construction has led to the Snobs Horse occasionally revealing itself, is because trenching is invasive in the hillside and allows traces of the figure to be seen even when the figure has been overgrown for many years. =Devizes Millennium White Horse= The nose of the horse, revealing the rock used for its nostril In 1998, a newcomer to Devizes, Sarah Padwick, who was presumably inspired by the other seven current white horses in Wiltshire, sent a letter to a local newspaper that there should be a white horse cut on Roundway Hill to celebrate the millennium. She was unaware of the very nearby Snobs Horse. The newspaper liked the idea and plans followed suit. Originally, the plan was to recut the Snobs Horse in its original location (the aforementioned 1998 attempt). This plan was unsuccessful due to the site being declared a Site of Special Scientific Interest. However a local farmer, Chris Combe, offered his part of land on Roundway Hill as an alternative site, provided permission was granted by the Crown Estates Commissioners, who own the land. Wiltshire County Council Tourism supported the project as did Roundway Parish Council who supported the planning application made to the Kennet District Council. This became the new location of the horse. The design of the horse was James Smith' design from 1954 except reversed so the horse faced right. The design was also a horse depicted as moving (the other Wiltshire White Horses are in a stood position) A committee was set up to oversee the project, the 'Cavaliers of the Devizes Millennium White Horse', and members of the public were invited to join. The group was also formed to support its future maintenance. Alan Truscott, of Sarsens Housing, joined the committee as the member in charge of the surveying and pegging out of the figure of the horse on the hill, alongside did Keith Saunders of Pearce Civil Engineering, who joined to provide the machinery and manpower to complete the clearing of the top soil and the infilling of the chalk following the cutting of the outline, the cutting of which was done by hand by various groups and individuals from the local community. 200 people helped cut the figure. It was anticipated that this project will promote Devizes, its ancient heritage and the attractive countryside surrounding it, as well as to be an additional feature to the tourist map of the area. The digging of the outline of the horse occurred over the weekend of 18/19 September 1999. The 200 people cutting were asked to dig one metre in length., the total length of the horse being 230m approx. On 20 September, the site became closed so that the sponsors of Pearce Civil Engineering to dig out the body of the horse for some several days. They also positioned the rocks used as the horse's eye and nostril. The Devizes White Horse was complete on 29 September 1999. Scouring and maintenance Devizes White Horse has occasionally fallen into states of disrepair, with the main threat to the site being the growth of weeds. A Beckhampton local, comparing the state of the Devizes horse in 2007 to the then-recently cleaned Westbury White Horse, was quoted by the Gazette and Herald as saying: \\"What a shame that the civic pride which led to this White Horse being created to celebrate the Millennium does not seem to have lasted longer than the first couple of years of that Millennium.\\" Subsequently, the first major clean-up, or scouring of the horse occurred over a two-day period in April 2007, in which Padwick invited volunteers to join forces and remove weeds, grasses and moss from the horse. By September 2008, the horse had again become barely visible. The Devizes Millennium White Horse Committee began seeking funds to scour the horse. These scouring plans were then passed to the Probation Service Community Service Group who subsequently thoroughly cleaned the horse, a task they have been since repeated regularly. In August 2014, a writer for the Wiltshire Times complained about the then-current condition of the horse, bemoaning the badly overgrown chalk surface and how the horse appeared \\"grey and blotchy from a distance. Usually, in the dry of summer, the chalk looks lovely and white,\\" as well as noting how \\"the gravel pathway leading to the mobility gate [was] so overgrown that no wheel or pushchair could go through to the seat in the field.\\" The writer hoped Roundway Parish Council \\"would consider some urgent maintenance.\\" Modern history The plaque on the entrance gate on the hill to the horse's designer, Peter Greed, who died in 2008. The Devizes White Horse is affectionately nicknamed \\"Chalkie\\" by locals. Shortly after the Devizes White Horse's completion, it was included alongside the other seven canonical Wiltshire white horses on the 90-mile walking tour 'Wiltshire's White Horse Trail', better known as simply the White Horse Trail, which visits all eight of the canonical white horses in Wiltshire. The tour was established in 2000 by the Wiltshire Tourism board. Padwick praised the trail, writing that \\"A lot of people are interested in doing recreational activities like this and taking on lesser and greater degrees of walking.\\" Since 2006, Devizes White Horse has been the start point for an annual charity event known as the White Horse Challenge, where participants tour the full 52-mile walk around the eight canonical Wiltshire white horses to raise money for Wiltshire Air Ambulance. The horse featured at the centre of the logo for Roundway Parish Council, who were uncomfortable with Roundway being mistaken for \\"a mere adjacent for Devizes,\\" and launched the logo for Roundway in 2011 to help distinguish the settlement from Devizes. Roundway Parish Council merged with Devizes Town Council in 2017, although Roundway's last chairman, Chris Callow, spoke proudly of the Roundway parish council's achievements, including helping with the cutting of the Devizes White Horse. Peter Greed, who designed the millennium horse, died after a long period of sickness in November 2008 at the age of 73, and is commemorated with a plaque on the entrance gate to Bank Field. =Celebrations= The White Horse Trail running near the Devizes horse in Beckhampton. Further celebrating the millennium, a time capsule was buried beneath the horse on 31 December 1999, with help from Pearce Civil Engineering, and the horse was floodlit the same night from dusk into the dawn of 1 January 2000. The time capsule, co- donated by Wessex Water, was full of oddities of local interest, while the floodlighting of the horse could be seen from miles back. The horse was lit up again on 30 June 2012 when, as part of the Ageas Salisbury International Arts Festival, both the Devizes White Horse and the nearby Alton Barnes White Horse were illuminated by lantern parades. Over 300 lanterns were placed around the Devizes horse and it was lit from 10pm to 12am. On 10 October 2009, to celebrate the horse's tenth anniversary, locals walked onto the horse, including the Mayor of Devizes, to form a human \\"10\\" figure. A light aircraft from GS Aviation flew over the \\"10\\" figure to take an aerial photograph of it. To celebrate the 13th birthday of the horse in autumn 2012, local residents Thelma and Colin Edwards decided to stage a picnic on the hill, inviting local community members and others who were involved in the cutting of the horse. The ceremony was hosted by Sarah Padwick as well as Kelvin Nash, the Mayor of Devizes, and also involved children bringing flowers to create a garland for the white horse's neck. A scout group in Devizes celebrated St. George's Day in 2017 by sprucing up and weeding the white horse. =Replica= To celebrate its 10th anniversary in 2012, Nursteed School in Devizes unveiled a small replica of the Millennium Horse on its grounds. This horse was constructed over a period of months by volunteers, including staff and students, and is a tenth the size of the original. A small number 10 was initially placed on the horse, resembling the human \\"10\\" figure that volunteers formed on the original millennium white horse in 2009 to celebrate its tenth birthday.

It was originally written by Jon Bon Jovi, Richie Sambora and Desmond Child and recorded in 2009. Originally intended as an exclusive track for the forthcoming National League Super Bowl season, it became a hit with Bon Jovi fans who asked for it to be including on the band's new hits collection. Greatest Hits had already been pressed to disk and it was too late to include the song of a physical format but it made its debut proper as a bonus track if one downloaded Greatest Hit from the band's website. The song was also released as a bonus track on the iTunes edition of their Greatest Hits collection in the UK and Europe, but was released as a digital single in September 2011. Bon Jovi opened many shows in 2010-2012 with This Is Our House. Designed as a \\"sports anthem\\", the song was used by a number of sports leagues and teams, including Australia's National Rugby League, who prominently used the song as part of its marketing campaign beginning in the 2011 season. In contrast, its use by the New Jersey Devils was deemed controversial by fans due to the traditions surrounding Gary Glitter's \\"Rock and Roll\\", which the team had discontinued to promote a more positive fan atmosphere. It has been the touchdown song for the New England Patriots since 2009.  Background  \\"This Is Our House\\" was written to be a \\"sports anthem\\"; speaking of the song, Jon Bon Jovi stated that \\"Having led an Arena Football League team from inception to championship and as a lifelong sports fan, I know the intensity and dedication that goes into cheering on your team.\\" Owing to its thematic, before the band performed the song during The Circle Tour at Mosaic Stadium at Taylor Field in Regina, Saskatchewan, Jon Bon Jovi suggested that the Saskatchewan Roughriders (who play their home games at Mosaic) adopt it as their theme song.  Use in sports  Fitting for its purpose, \\"This Is Our House\\" saw a number of uses by sports teams and leagues. In February 2011, Australia's National Rugby League announced that \\"This Is Our House\\" would be the official theme song of the league beginning in the 2011 season, securing rights to the song for three years for use in its promotional campaigns. The song primarily appeared in television commercials, and as the theme music for Nine Network telecasts of the league. Fan reception to the campaign was positive, so much so that the NRL wanted to have Bon Jovi make a live appearance during its championship game, the NRL Grand Final. However, Kelly Clarkson was chosen to perform instead. The song was used until the 2013 NRL season, when it was replaced by a cover of \\"Something's Got a Hold on Me\\" by Jessica Mauboy. The song was also used in promotions by the New York Rangers, the New England Patriots, and the National Football League. At their home opener for the 2013-14 season on October 5, 2013, the National Hockey League's New Jersey Devils adopted \\"This Is Our House\\" as its goal music, replacing part 2 of Gary Glitter's \\"Rock and Roll\\"‚Äîwhose use by the team dated back to the team's move from Colorado in 1982. The team later stated that the change was intended to \\"[create] a game experience that represents what we are on the ice, makes all age groups proud of who we are, and represents our community\\"‚Äîa comment alluding a mocking \\"hey, you suck!\\" chant sung in tune to the song by fans. The change was met with an immediately negative response; fans booed the playing of \\"This Is Our House\\" throughout the game and reacted via social networking services. Yahoo! Sports writer Greg Wyshynski pointed out the irony of Bon Jovi's music being booed by residents of their own state, joking that doing so \\"might be grounds for deportation in New Jersey. (OK, maybe just a shakedown from the feds; booing Bruce would mean deportation.)\\" Following a vote by fans on the team's website alongside Locksley's \\"The Whip\\" and Monster Truck's \\"Righteous Smoke\\", \\"This Is Our House\\" was ultimately replaced by The White Stripes' \\"Seven Nation Army\\".

Plot Conan, imprisoned by a satrap named Torgat Khan, escapes and is reunited with a band of thieves he's leading in the deserts southwest of Turan. Subsequently, the thieves plan on looting the Khan's treasury, held in a vault beneath the newly built temple of the sinister cult of Ahriman, the priests of which hope to revive their ancient god. Persuaded that mystical aid will be needed to ensure success, Conan agrees on accepting the aid of a kind wizard named Volvolicus and his daughter, Layla. After stealing the Khan's treasure, Conan is pursued by the Manhunters, a band of bounty hunters with specialized skills led by a captain even more powerful than Conan himself.

Writing of some other Tor Conan novels, reviewer Ryan Harvey called Roberts \\"the most consistently successful of its stable of authors,\\" and \\"the most consistently entertaining\\" of them, showing \\"deft ability with storytelling and action scenes, and a thankful tendency not to overplay his hand and try to ape Robert E.

The Harvard-educated scientist was born in Nairobi in 1938. After graduating from Harvard with a degree in physics, Ng‚Äôweno worked as a reporter for the Daily Nation for nine months before his appointment as the newspaper‚Äôs first Kenyan editor-in-chief. He resigned in 1965 and established a successful career as a journalist for more than forty years. In 1973, together with journalist Terry Hirst, he founded Joe, a political satire comic magazine that circulated in many parts of Africa until the late seventies when its publication ceased. He is best known as the editor-in-chief of the Weekly Review, a weekly newsmagazine than ran from 1975 to 1999. He is also the founder of The Nairobi Times and the first independent TV news station in Kenya, STV. He is currently the producer of documentary videos on Kenyan history, including the Making of a Nation and Kenya's Darkest Hour. Career in journalism In 1975, Ng'weno founded The Weekly Review, a journal of political news, commentary and analysis followed in 1977 by The Nairobi Times, a Sunday newspaper that later became a daily. At the beginning, The Weekly Review and The Nairobi Times being locally owned enterprises, fared well in a field dominated by the (then) foreign owned Daily Nation and The Standard but like other local papers, they faced stiff competition from the established papers for little or lack of advertising from the mostly foreign companies in Kenya. Because the advertising community was still controlled by foreigners, it tended to favour the foreign owned publications. Advertisers were also not too keen to deal with publications that were likely to stir the wrath of the government with inflammatory political reports. Ng‚Äôweno‚Äôs publications lasted an impressive length of time. His publications continued to gain popularity, and The Weekly Review went on to dominate the weekly news scene for more than 20 years, becoming one of Africa‚Äôs best news magazines. Due to diminishing revenue from advertising sales, Ng'weno however, sold The Nairobi Times in 1983 to KANU, Kenya‚Äôs then ruling party. The paper was renamed The Kenya Times, but its popularity suffered, as it was seen to be the mouthpiece of an oppressive government in a political era likened to dictatorship. The Kenya Times wound up in July 2010. Ng‚Äôweno diversified his media empire, which included other periodicals such as The Financial Review, The Industrial Review and Rainbow, a monthly children‚Äôs magazine. His publishing company, Stellascope was acquired by KANU when the latter purchased The Nairobi Times. The Weekly Review folded on May 17, 1999 after 24 years of publication and Ng'weno moved on to television broadcasting launching a television station, STV Kenya. Following the sale of STV in 2000, Ng'weno reinvented himself as a historian, drawing on materials from his journalistic career. Jointly with the Nation Media Group he produced the 15-part series, the Making of Nation (2007). Jointly with NTV, he has produced over 160 individual half-hour profiles of important figures in Kenya's history, a series entitled Makers of Nation. Personal life Hilary Ng‚Äôweno has been married to Fleur Ng‚Äôweno (n√©e Grandjouan), a native of France, for nearly fifty years. Mrs. Ng‚Äôweno, a naturalist, writer and former editor, holds a BSc degree in conservation from the University of Michigan. She has been actively involved in environmental issues in Kenya for more than forty years, serving as Honorary Secretary to NatureKenya, (formerly the East Africa Natural History Society). Their two daughters Amolo Ng'weno and Dr. Bettina Ng'weno are also distinguished achievers in education and media. The Harvard and Princeton educated Amolo served as deputy director of financial services for the poor at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In 1994, Amolo together with two other Kenyans, Ayisi Makatiani and Karanja Gakio, founded Africaonline one of the first internet service providers in Africa. The three Kenyans met while still students in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2005. Format: Paperback, 295 pp. Language: English. Born in Havana, Mickey P√©rez was one of the seven players born in Cuba to play the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League in its twelve years history, being the others Isabel Alvarez (1949‚Äì1954), Isora del Castillo (1949‚Äì1951), Luisa Gallegos (1948‚Äì1949), Mirtha Marrero (1948‚Äì1953), Gloria Ruiz (1948‚Äì1949) and Zonia Vialat (1948). The first AAGPBL spring training outside the United States was held in 1947 in Havana, Cuba, as part of a plan to create an International League of Girls Baseball. All the eight AAGPBL teams played exhibition games at Estadio Latinoamericano. On the other hand, the Brooklyn Dodgers trained in the Cuban capital because Jackie Robinson, who would be the first Afro-American to play in the Major Leagues, was training with the Dodgers for the first time. By then, city ordinances in Vero Beach, Florida, where the Dodgers normally trained, prevented blacks and whites players from competing on the same field against each other. Notably, newspaper stories from Havana indicate that the All-American girls drew larger crowds for their games than did the Dodgers. At this time, the six Cuban girls were recruited to play in the AAGPBL. That season the league made the transition from underhand to full sidearm pitching.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Rules of Play P√©rez entered the league in 1948 with the Chicago Colleens, playing for them one year before joining the Springfield Sallies (1949‚Äì1950), Battle Creek Belles (1951‚Äì1952) and Rockford Peaches (1952‚Äì1954). She had a diverse repertoire of pitches, which included a strong fastball, a curve, and a change that often had hitters way out in front, but the key was always been in control of her pitches. When the ball-strike count favored her, she was solid and concentrated better. When she was behind, she was vulnerable and created many of her own problems because she had to sacrifice some velocity for control. In addition, she was plagued by a shortage of run support for much of her career while pitching for awful teams.The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League In 1951, P√©rez posted a 13‚Äì16 record and a 3.00 earned run average in 32 pitching appearances for the Belles, while leading the league in complete games (26), innings pitched (237) and hits allowed (241). The next season she went 11‚Äì12 with a 2.34 ERA in a combined action between Battle Creek and Rockford, leading the league in games pitched (33) and ranking sixth in innings pitched (208).All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book ‚Äì W. C. Madden. Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2000. Format: Paperback, 294pp. Language: English. P√©rez had mixed results in the 1953 season, going 12‚Äì14 for Racine though her 2.25 ERA was the ninth best in the league. She also finished eight in innings pitched (220) and tied for eight in complete games (20). Her career highlight came on August 10 of that year, when she hurled a no-hitter against the powerful Grand Rapids Chicks lineup featuring Wilma Briggs, Betty Foss, Jean Geissinger, Katie Horstman, Pepper Paire and Joanne Weaver, among others.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book1953 Fort Wayne Daisies In 1954, during what turned out to be the final season of the league, P√©rez went 11‚Äì11 in 24 games and ended third in innings pitched (164), eight in complete games (15) and tenth in ERA (3.73), while tying for sixth in wins. P√©rez compiled a 57‚Äì70 record in 155 games, while her 2.73 career ERA ranks her twenty-second in the all-time list of AAGPBL pitchers with at least 1,000 innings of work. She also went 1‚Äì3 with a 3.00 ERA in five playoff games (two years). In 1988, P√©rez became part of Women in Baseball, a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League.

King Henry IV of France was his godfather. In a contract of inheritance dated 1619, Francis Henry recognized his elder brother Augustus as sovereign, in exchange for an annual appanage of 2500 thaler. When King Gustav II Adolf of Sweden landed in Peenem√ºnde in 1630, Francis Henry entered his service and earned his affection. He fought as colonel and regiment commander under general Johan Ban√©r and was victorious in the Battle of Wittstock in 1636. Gustav Adolf gave Francis Henry the estates of the nunnery of Marienflie√ü Abbey in Pomerania.Bernd Warlich, \\"Sachsen- Lauenburg, Franz Heinrich von\\", on: Der Drei√üigj√§hrige Krieg in Selbstzeugnissen, Chroniken und Berichten, retrieved on 13 October 2011.

After his mother's death in 1635, he received Franzhagen in a division of her property among her sons. When his brother Augustus died, Francis Henry received Wangelau and Rothenbeck (a part of today's Grande) in addition. While in Swedish service and thereafter he spent a lot of time with Sophia of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg (1579‚Äì1658), dowager of Philip II, Duke of Pomerania. Sophia's and Francis Henry's fathers were cousins. It was at her dower in Treptow upon Rega, a former nunnery which she had converted into a castle, where Francis Henry and Marie Juliane of Nassau-Siegen (1612‚Äì1665) married on 13 December 1637.N.N., \\"VII.

Francis Henry also served Sophia as administrator of the estates pertaining to her dower. Francis Henry and his brother Francis Charles objected the planned succession of their brother Julius Henry as sole ruler of Saxe-Lauenburg. However, when Julius Henry succeeded their late elder half-brother Augustus, deceased in 1656, this dispute was finally resolved. Later Francis Henry resided at Franzhagen Castle.

With local benefactors led by engineering inventor Samson Fox, the building opened in 1903 as the Kursaal. It had been constructed on the site of the former Cheltenham Pump Room, as visitors to the town seeking the famed spa water, had declined in the latter half of the 19th century. The Kursaal was designed by Robert Beale and Frank Matcham, one of the most prolific theatre architects of his time, it was loosely based on the design of the Ostende Kursall in Belgium. Kursaal is a German language word which translates literally as ‚ÄúCure Hall,‚Äù but was used for grand receptions and special occasions. A popular form of building in late 19th-century European spa destinations, the concept never caught on in the United Kingdom. Hence as World War I began, the theatre was renamed the more patriotic \\"Royal Hall\\". In the 1950s, like many theatres converted into a cinema but looking for alternative uses, the venue helped in the formation and growth of Harrogate as a conference and exhibition centre. The Royal Hall is an important national heritage building, with Harrogate acknowledged as a top UK event destination and home to Harrogate International Centre.Royal Hall history By 1997 the Royal Hall needed renovation, and in 2001, English Heritage put the building on the national ‚Äúbuildings at risk‚Äù register. The Harrogate Borough Council formed the Royal Hall Restoration Trust to raise the ¬£10.7 million needed for the restoration. Supported by Edward Fox, a great- grandson of Samson Fox, donations were received from the Council, Harrogate International Centre, and the Heritage Lottery Fund, with the trust itself raising ¬£2.7 million from local benefactors. This allowed for an authentic interior redecoration and the restoration of the dress circle. The patron of the Royal Hall Restoration Trust, Prince Charles, led the Hall‚Äôs official re- opening on 22 January 2008. Harrogate's Royal Hall has been the central venue within the Harrogate International Festivals portfolio, since the Festival was established in 1966, and in 2014 played host to J.K.

He is an alumnus of the Takushoku University. Amateur career Kobayashi who had practiced kendo until high school graduation, began boxing after admission to the Physical Training School of the Self Defense Forces. He won the All-Japan Amateur Boxing Championships in the featherweight division in 1971 and 1972. Kobayashi represented Japan at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich. In the second round match against Pat Ryan, Kobayashi knocked him down thrice, badly damaged his face, and won by a 4‚Äì1 decision. Beaver County Times called it \\"the most ridiculous decision of the night\\". Kobayashi then knocked out Italy's Pasqualino Morbidelli in one round, before losing 1‚Äì4 to Andr√°s Botos in the quarterfinals. He compiled an amateur record of 34‚Äì3 (28 KOs) before turning professional. Professional career Since Kobayashi was an amateur boxer, he was said to be suitable for professional for his hard punches. In 1973, Kobayashi ran into Yoshinori Takahashi who is the president of Kokusai Boxing Sports Gym established in Tokyo in 1971 at a sports massage clinic, and was encouraged to turn professional. Kobayashi made his professional debut under the ring name Royal Kobayashi in an eight-round bout in February 1973. His first world title shot against WBA featherweight champion Alexis Arg√ºello ended in a fifth round knockout loss, in front of 16,000 spectators at the Kuramae Kokugikan in Tokyo in October 1975. After the fight, Kobayashi stated that he felt as if he had been beaten with a chunk of ice. In February 1976, he made an expedition to Panama, and lost on points there. On October 9, 1976, Kobayashi moved down a weight class and dethroned Rigoberto Riasco as the WBC and lineal junior featherweight champion while being watched by 9,000 spectators at the Kuramae Kokugikan. He floored Riasco once with his left hook in the seventh round, and twice with his right hooks in the eighth round. However, he lost the title in his first defense against Dong-Kyun Yum via a majority decision at the Jangchung Gymnasium in Seoul, South Korea, on November 24 of that year. In January 1978, Kobayashi challenged Wilfredo G√≥mez to regain the WBC junior featherweight title in front of 10,000 spectators at the Kitaky≈´sh≈´ Municipal Gymnasium in Fukuoka, but was knocked out in the third round. Kobayashi went back to the featherweight division, and captured the OPBF title in April 1978. After defending that title once, he fought against Eusebio Pedroza for the WBA featherweight title at the Korakuen Hall in January 1979. However he quit after thirteen rounds with his face swollen by a barrage of blows in the eighth round. Kobayashi defended the OPBF title seven times in total, for about two and a half years. In his eighth defense in October 1981, he suffered a first round knockout loss and retired as a boxer. His manager Takahashi later told that he realized the importance of short punches when Kobayashi lost to Pedroza and when he brought up Leopard Tamakuma to be a world champion he taught it to him thoroughly.

Hatanaka began karate at the first grade of elementary school, and won the Japanese championship in the juvenile division at its sixth grade and the first grade of junior high school. In addition, he began football at the fourth grade of elementary school, and was scouted by a prestigious high school. He also set an interval record in the local ekiden race at the age of a junior high school student. At that time, informed from an acquaintance that a professional boxer got paid 30,000 yen per match in the amount of time, he became interested in boxing and joined Matsuda Boxing Gym. He compiled an amateur record of 28-0(21 KOs) before turning professional. Hatanaka made his professional debut with a first-round knockout victory in November 1984, at the age of a high school student. He won the annual Japanese boxing series, All-Japan Rookie King Tournament in the super flyweight division in March 1986. He captured the Japanese super flyweight title at the Korakuen Hall in February 1987. In his first world title shot against WBC super flyweight champion Gilberto Rom√°n in September 1988, Hatanaka entered the ring of the Nagoya Rainbow Hall with full smile. Hatanaka floored Rom√†n in the first round, but was docked a point for a low blow late in the same round. Though Rom√†n was given a full five minutes to recover, he was hit below the belt again in the third round and took three minutes' rest. As the rounds rolled on, Hatanaka kept his pace to win the WBC title via a unanimous decision. Hatanaka was so nervous that he remembered almost nothing after the fight. After the Victory, Hatanaka decided to become a Undisputed World champion from his beloved hometown of Nagoya by any means necessary. It was no longer a question of money for him. Hatanaka needed a reliable trainer. He asked Toshihide Tsutsumi three times who once worked as a trainer at Matsuda Boxing Gym, and was at last accepted. He trained with Tsutsumi and did not get anxious anymore. Hatanaka then fought against Pedro Rub√©n D√©cima for the WBA IBF super Flyweight title at the Nagoya International Exhibition Hall, aka Port Messe Nagoya, on February 3, 1991. Hatanka floored Pedro in the first round, but felt calm enough to pummel Pedro round by round. After knocking down D√©cima four times in the fourth round, he sent him to the canvas two more times in the seventh and eighth rounds before the referee stopped the bout. In his first defense against Daniel Zaragoza on June 14 of that year, Zaragoza was cut on the corner of his left eye from an accidental head butt in the fourth round, and the referee took a point away from Zaragoza. From the seventh or eighth round, Zaragoza had triple vision in his right eye, and the blood flowed into his left eye. Finally, Hatanaka remained the undisputed world champion via a split decision in front of 9,000 spectators at the Nagoya Rainbow Hall. In 2007, Alvaro Morales of ESPN Deportes wrote it as many Asians' consideration, \\"the best fight of the decade\\". Although Zaragoza desired a rematch with Hatanaka, he suffered from ophthalmoplegia caused by this fight, and retired as a boxer after four months. Hatanaka would go on to make 17 title defenses before retiring Currently he is the president of Hatanaka Boxing Gym in Nagoya. Hatanaka Promotions has provided a boxing television program Soul Fighting on Chubu-Nippon Broadcasting. Toshihide Tsutsumi who was presented with the tenth Eddie Townsend Award in 1999, serves as a trainer at that gym.

One of only four airports in the country, it opened on 17 December 2011 with flights to Paro. The airport suspended operations in July 2012 due to runway damage,http://www.bbs.bt/news/?p=15266 but it has since reopened to limited service. Overview A The airport was in development from the Royal Bhutanese Government's 10th Five Year Plan (2008). The airport was originally scheduled to open in October 2010, and then delayed to November 2010. By December 2010, operations were pushed back to March 2011, then April 2011. Shortages in the spring prompted a new target date of July 2011, however the airport had not yet opened for operations through late 2011. Airport construction at Bathpalathang met several delays, including soil instability under the runway, funding, labor and material shortages, and nearby river protection and diversion, each of which underpinned the ultimate success of any airport at the site. Despite assurances by government personnel and contractors that the airport would be completed on time, it was completed significantly behind schedule. Further complications arose from legislated land and property compensation schemes for those who were forced to relocate to accommodate the airport. Both Druk Air and Tashi Air conducted inaugural flights to Bathpalathang on 17 December 2011, coinciding with the national day of Bhutan. However, Druk Air's inaugural flight failed to make a profit. A redevelopment project is underway as of April 2015, with a cost of over Nu 15 million. The first phase, the construction of an apron capable of handling 2 ATR aircraft, is nearing completion. The second phase involves the construction of a terminal building. Once the terminal has been built, the new apron will begin to be used.http://www.bbs.bt/news/?p=49854 Airlines and destinations See also * Transport in Bhutan *List of airports in Bhutan References Category:Airports in Bhutan Category:Bumthang District ","title":"Bathpalathang Airport"},{"id":"33023836","text":"Joan Robinson, in her book The Accumulation of CapitalJoan Robinson, The Accumulation of Capital (London: Macmillan & Co.

However, the Accumulation of Capital was a terse book and in one of her other books entitled Essays in the theory of Economic Growth,Joan Robinson, Essays in the Theory of Economic Growth (London: Macmillan & Co. Ltd., 1963) she tried to lower the degree of abstraction. The growth model was propagated in verbal terms, where later on the mathematical formalization was put forward by Kenneth K. Kurihara. Assumptions: # There is a laissez-faire closed economy. # The factors of production are capital and labour only. # There is neutral technical progress. # There are only two classes: workers and capitalists, among whom the national income is distributed. # Workers save nothing and spend their wage income on consumption. # Capitalists consume nothing, but save and invest their entire income for capital formation. # There is no change in the price level. # Saving is a function of profit. The model The entrepreneurs‚Äô total profit and the workers‚Äô total wage bill constitute the net national income. It can be mathematically expressed as :pY=wN+œÄpK where Y is the net national income, w is the money wage rate, N is the number of workers employed, K is the amount of capital utilized, p is the average price of output as well as of capital and œÄ is the gross profit rate.

Its definition is practically important in English land law, because when a purchase of property in land is made, without specifying what exactly will be transferred, the law must give an answer as to what should accompany the transfer. Property in land, under the English system of rules, is said to be \\"four dimensional\\". It covers not just area (two dimensions), but also things below the surface and above (three dimensions), and extends over a period of time (four dimensions). Statutory meaning The Law of Property Act 1925, section 205(1)(ix) gives the following definition of land. Three dimensions The Act goes on to define \\"mines and minerals\\" as \\"any strate or seam of minerals or substances in or under any land, and powers of working and getting the same\\". It goes on further to define a \\"hereditament\\" as \\"any real property which on an intestacy occurring before the commencement of this Act might have devolved upon an heir\\". The legal maxim is cuius est solum eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos, which is Latin for \\"he who owns the land owns everything up to the heavens and down to the depths.\\" Since the 13th century this has been complicated by flying freeholds, the right of aircraft to fly over a property (as in Bernstein of Leigh v Skyviews & General Ltd[1978] QB 479), the Crown's claim on certain resources and mineral rights (as in the Case of Mines(1568) 1 Plowd 210 Coal Industry Act 1994, Petroleum Act 1998) and treasure (Treasure Act 1996). Nevertheless, cases such as Kelsen v Imperial Tobacco Co Ltd[1957] 2 QB 334 and Laiquat v Majid[2005] EWHC 1305 illustrate that the courts generally support the freeholder's right to control things that overhang or underlie the ground he holds. Fixtures The legal maxim is quicquid plantatur solo, solo cedit, which is Latin for \\"that which is fixed to the land becomes part of it\\". Holland v Hodgson[1872] LR 7 CP 328 explored this. The context was the question of whether looms installed in a factory formed part of the land. Blackburn J said that an object resting on the ground and \\"attached\\" to it only by its weight will not normally be part of the land, but it is relevant to ask what was intended. So, for example, a pile of stones in a field is not part of the land, but if the stones are arranged into a dry stone wall then the wall has become a part of it. In Botham v TSB Plc[1997] 73 P & CR D 1 it was decided at appeal that things easily removed, such as curtains and carpets, are not part of the land, but things not easily removed, such as taps and plugs, are. In Chelsea Yacht and Boat Club v Pope[2001] 2 All ER 409 it was held that a houseboat does not form part of the land because it is insufficiently fixed. Water In the law of England and Wales, land may lie under water, but the water does not necessarily form part of the land.Water flowing through a river, for example, is ownerless. See Gregory and Parrish 1987, p. 147. The Land Registration Act 2002, section 132 (1)(b) says that \\"land\\" includes land covered with water. For most practical purposes, water may be used by the person owning the land on which it is, but there are restrictions on some activities, such as large-scale abstractions of water or activities which may pollute it (see, for example, the Water Resources Act 1991). Tidal waters are treated differently. They generally belong to the Crown or to a local authority, and the public has the right to pass over tidal waters and to fish in them.

Amatuximab is an anti- mesothelin monoclonal antibody MORAb-009 binds to mesothelin (a protein that is made by some cancer cells) and stops the cells from dividing, and also called MORAb-009. Intellectual Property In December 2005 Morphotek signed an exclusive license agreement for MORAb-009 with the National Cancer Institute. Quickly following they opened an Investigation New Drug Application with the FDA in 2006 and initiated Phase I clinical trials. In November 2010, Morphotek (now as an acquisition of Eisai Co. Ltd.) entered a Sponsored Research Agreement (SRA) with Hokkaido University in Sapporo, Japan to perform studies evaluating the use of amatuximab in advanced pancreatic cancer. Specifically, the study was investigating the anti-tumor effect of amatuximab as a single agent as well as in combination with gemcitabine. The FDA granted amatuximab orphan drug status for use in malignant pleural mesothelioma in November 2012, and the European Commission soon followed granting orphan drug status in January 2014.

In February 2017 it received US FDA approval to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in people who have not improved with other treatments. Use is linked to an increased risk of suicide.  Mechanism of action  Brodalumab binds to the interleukin-17 receptor and so prevents interleukin 17 (IL-17) from activating the receptor. This mechanism is similar to that of another anti- psoriasis antibody, ixekizumab, which however binds to IL-17 itself. History Brodalumab was developed by Amgen, Inc. as AMG 827. In 2013 it was in two phase III clinical trials for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis. In November 2014, Amgen and AstraZeneca reported encouraging results for the compound. The companies stated that the compound met the primary endpoint showing superior skin clearance in a Phase III trial when compared to ustekinumab and a placebo. However, in May 2015, Amgen announced that it was ending its participation in co-development of the compound because of reports of patients having \\"events of suicidal ideation and behavior\\". AstraZeneca will be solely responsible for any future development and marketing of brodalumab in all territories except for certain Asian territories such as Japan, where Kyowa Hakko Kirin has rights to brodalumab and continued as KHK4827. In September 2015, AstraZeneca announced a partnership with Valeant Pharmaceuticals in which Valeant took over exclusive rights to develop and commercialize brodalumab. In July 2016, the rights to commercialize brodalumab in Europe were sold to LEO Pharma. In January 2016, a biologics license application (BLA) was submitted to the US FDA.

Crenezumab is highly homologous to solanezumab, another monoclonal antibody targeting amyloid-Œ≤ peptides.  Development  Crenezumab was developed by Ruth Greferath, Ph.D., and Claude Nicolau, Ph.D., before the Swiss-based biopharmaceutical company AC Immune was founded, which focuses on developing targeted therapeutics for misfolded proteins that cause neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. AC Immune was founded in 2003 by current CEO Andrea Pfeifer, Ph.D. and funded primarily by German billionaire Dietmar Hopp. In 2016, AC Immune filed for an IPO valuing the company at $700 million and subsequently sold 6.9 million shares for net proceeds of $68.73 million. To develop crenezumab, AC Immune utilized its SupraAntigen technology, which involves injecting mice with liposomes that contain several hundred peptide mimics of antigens in order to generate a multitude of antibodies, from which the ones with best specificity are selected. It is believed that crenezumab works by causing beta amyloid proteins to transition from an insoluble to a soluble form, inhibiting aggregation and promoting disaggregation of existing plaques. Crenezumab was licensed to Genentech, Inc. in 2006. Genentech is fully responsible for the clinical development, manufacturing, and commercialization of crenezumab.  Patent  Crenezumab is protected under US Patent US7892544, which was filed June 12, 2007. As of November 2016, there are two other drugs in development which also target beta amyloid, namely solanezumab and aducanumab.  Clinical trials  = ABBY study = ABBY was a phase II study that evaluated the effects of crenezumab in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's Disease, which concluded in 2014. The primary endpoints were reduction in cognitive decline and global function decline. Patients treated with high-dose intravenous crenuzumab showed non-significant reductions in both cognitive decline and global function decline, while patients who received subcutaneous crenezumab did not improve on either measure. Exploratory analysis of patients with the mildest symptoms (as defined by a Mini Mental State Examination score of 22-26) who received high-dose intravenous crenezumab did show a significant reduction in cognitive decline, but not in global function decline. = BLAZE study = BLAZE was a phase II study that also concluded in 2014 and evaluated the effects of crenezumab in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's Disease, however its primary endpoint was changes in brain amyloid load, with secondary endpoints of changes in other biomarkers, cognition, global function, and activities of daily living. The resultant data showed no significant difference between either high-dose intravenous or subcutaneous crenezumab and placebo. = ADAD trial = In May 2012, it was announced that the efficacy of crenezumab will be tested in a five-year trial against early- onset Alzheimer's disease. The $100 million trial will be funded by Genentech, the Banner Alzheimer's Institute, and the National Institutes of Health. Participants in the study will be recruited from an extended family in and around Medell√≠n, Colombia. Approximately one-third of the 5,000 family members carry an autosomal dominant allele of presenilin-1 (PSEN1) that causes the early-onset form of Alzheimer's disease. The trial will test the effect of the drug on 300 individuals who have the PSEN1 mutation, but do not yet show symptoms of the disease. = CREAD study = In July 2015, Genentech announced it was moving crenezumab into a phase III study, known as CREAD, to evaluate the effects of crenezumab in patients with prodromal-to-mild Alzheimer's Disease. This study aims to enroll 750 individuals between the ages of 50 and 85 at 233 international sites. The primary outcome measure for this trial is change in clinical dementia rating, with secondary outcomes of changes in cognition, quality of life, and time to clinically evident decline, among others. The study was expected to conclude in 2021 but Roche has withdrawn its support in the middle of Phase III due to the initial assessment.

It is part of the UNESCO Cultural World Heritage Site of the Old City of Bern and, together with the adjacent Untertorbr√ºcke, it is a cultural property of national significance History The Felsenburg was built soon after the construction of the first Untertor Bridge connected the medieval city of Bern to the eastern bank of the Aare river. It was built as part of the defenses of the city and served to secure the eastern end of the bridge. The Felsenburg was probably built in 1260-70, but it is first mentioned in 1335. The original tower was open in the back, toward the city. The entire tower was renovated in 1583 and the open side was closed. During the renovation, the coat of arms of the Bernese city- state were painted on the exterior. Between 1625-30, the gate was fortified, the end of the bridge was moved to the north, a new bridge was built over the moat and a bastion was added on the moat side. The next renovation took place in 1760-61. The gate arch was rebuilt and the tower's facade was completely redone. In 1783, a new, stone bridge was built over the moat and in 1820-21 the moat was filled in with stone. In 1862 the tower was sold to a private owner. Over the next two years, the new owner converted the tower into a rental house. Stairs were added to the north-east face and the gate arch from 1761 was demolished. Tower appearance The tower is rectangular in cross section. The longer sides are oriented to the north-west and south-east. The ground floor is . The north-east wall, that faced the moat, was originally part of the city wall. In the basement it is thick. The ground floor wall is while on the upper story it is only thick.

Chemically, it is a form of a humanized monoclonal antibody. The substance acts by binding interleukin 17A and neutralizing it, reducing inflammation. The most common side effects include upper respiratory infections, injection site reactions and fungal (tinea) infections. The drug was developed by Eli Lilly and Co. and is approved for the treatment of plaque psoriasis in the European Union and the United States.  Medical uses  In the United States, ixekizumab is indicated for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy, active psoriatic arthritis, active ankylosing spondylitis, and active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with objective signs of inflammation. In the European Union it is indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and as a second-line therapy for active psoriatic arthritis. In studies, the drug reduced the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index by at least 75% (PASI75) in 82‚Äì89% of patients during the first three months of treatment (depending on the dosing scheme), and 40% of patients experienced a complete absence of psoriasis symptoms (PASI100). In the placebo group, PASI75 was reached in 4% of patients, and PASI100 in none; in the group of patients receiving etanercept, an older anti-psoriasis drug, PASI75 was reached in 48%. Until the 60th study week, 11‚Äì44% of ixekizumab treated patients relapsed (again, depending on the dosing scheme), as compared to 84% under placebo.  Contraindications  The medication is contraindicated for patients with certain infections such as active tuberculosis.  Adverse effects  In studies, ixekizumab increased the rate of infections (27% of ixekizumab treated patients, compared to 23% under placebo), including severe ones (0.6% versus 0.4% under placebo). Other common side effects included injection site pain (13‚Äì17% versus 3%), oropharyngeal pain (1%) and nausea (1‚Äì2%).  Overdose  Up to fourfold doses have been given in studies without causing serious side effects.  Interactions  No interaction studies have been done. Ixekizumab and interleukin 17 are not known to interact with cytochrome P450 (CYP) liver enzymes. Since inflammation suppresses CYP activity, it is theorized that ixekizumab could neutralize this effect and lower blood plasma concentrations of drugs that are metabolized by CYP enzymes, such as warfarin.  Pharmacology  = Mechanism of action = Ixekizumab binds to interleukin 17 (IL-17A), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, and blocks its action. Among other things, IL-17A stimulates proliferation and activation of keratinocytes in the skin. This mechanism is similar to that of another anti-psoriasis antibody, brodalumab, which binds to the interleukin-17 receptor. The antibody has affinity to the homodimer IL-17A and the heterodimer IL-17A/F, but not to other members of the interleukin 17 family. = Pharmacokinetics = After subcutaneous injection, ixekizumab has a bioavailability of 54‚Äì90%. Highest blood plasma concentrations are reached after four to seven days after a single dose. With the usual dosing scheme (loading plus a dose every two weeks), steady state concentrations are reached in the eighth week on average. Like other antibodies, ixekizumab is probably degraded by proteolysis. Its elimination half-life is 13 days.  Chemistry  Ixekizumab is a complete monoclonal antibody of the subclass IgG4, consisting of two light chains and two heavy chains linked by disulfide bridges. Both heavy chains are glycosylated at the asparagine in position 296. In the hinge region, a serine is replaced by a proline to reduce formation of half-antibodies and heterodimers in the manufacturing process. The terminal lysine found in wild- type IgG4 is removed. The antibody is produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells.  History  Clinical trials included a Phase II trial of patients with moderate to severe psoriasis, and a Phase III open-label trial. Ixekizumab was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2016, for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in April 2016. The safety and efficacy of ixekizumab were established in three randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials with a total of 3,866 participants with plaque psoriasis who were candidates for systemic or phototherapy therapy. The FDA approved ixekizumab based on the evidence from three clinical trials of 1958 participants with moderate to severe psoriasis. The trials were conducted in the USA, Canada, Europe, Russia, Mexico, Chile, Argentina, Japan and Australia. In December 2017, the FDA approved it for active psoriatic arthritis.

It was approved in Japan in 2012, for the treatment of relapsed or refractory CCR4+ adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATCLL) and in 2014, for relapsed or refractory CCR4+ cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL). The latter approval was based on study with 28 subjects. The precursor to mogamulizumab was a mouse anti-human CCR4 IgG1 mAb (KM2160), that was made in 1996 in a collaboration between Kouji Matsushima of University of Tokyo and Kyowa Hakko Kirin. Kyowa humanized it, and expressed the humanized gene in a CHO cell line in which FUT8 had been knocked out, which produced antibodies with no fucose in the Fc region. This is thought to enhance its antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. It was first tested in humans in 2007. Kyowa licensed rights for use outside of cancer to Amgen in 2008, for $100 million up front and $420 million in biodollars. Amgen ran a Phase I study to explore its use in asthma. Amgen terminated the agreement in 2014. As of 2014, there were reports that mogamulizimab can cause serious skin rashes and some cases of Stevens‚ÄìJohnson syndrome.

Moxetumomab pasudotox is a CD22-directed cytotoxin and is the first of this type of treatment for adults with HCL. The drug consists of the binding fragment (Fv) of an anti- CD22 antibody fused to a toxin called PE38. This toxin is a 38 kDa fragment of Pseudomonas exotoxin A. Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is a rare, slow-growing cancer of the blood in which the bone marrow makes too many B cells (lymphocytes), a type of white blood cell that fights infection. HCL is named after these extra B cells which look ‚Äúhairy‚Äù when viewed under a microscope. As the number of leukemia cells increases, fewer healthy white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets are produced.  Adverse effects  Common side effects include infusion-related reactions, swelling caused by excess fluid in body tissue (edema), nausea, fatigue, headache, fever (pyrexia), constipation, anemia and diarrhea. The prescribing information for moxetumomab pasudotox includes a boxed warning about the risk of developing capillary leak syndrome, a condition in which fluid and proteins leak out of tiny blood vessels into surrounding tissues. Symptoms of capillary leak syndrome include difficulty breathing, weight gain, hypotension, or swelling of arms, legs and/or face. The boxed warning also notes the risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome, a condition caused by the abnormal destruction of red blood cells. Other serious warnings include: decreased renal function, infusion-related reactions and electrolyte abnormalities. Women who are breastfeeding should not be given Lumoxiti.  Discovery and ownership background  On 1 November 2005, Cambridge Antibody Technology (CAT) announced it was acquiring two anti-CD22 immunotoxin products from Genencor, namely GCR-3888 and GCR-8015. Genencor is the biotechnology division of Danisco and the acquisition meant CAT would hire certain former Genencor key employees to be responsible for the development of the programmes. GCR-3888 and GCR-8015 were discovered and initially developed by the National Cancer Institute, which is part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Genencor licensed the candidates for hematological malignancies and entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the NIH, which will now be continued by CAT. Under the original license agreement with the NIH, CAT gained the rights to a portfolio of intellectual property associated with the programs and would pay future royalties to the NIH. CAT intended to file an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for GCR-8015 in various CD22 positive B-cell malignancies, including Non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, following a period of manufacturing development which is expected to be complete by the end of 2006 and to support the NCI's ongoing development of GCR-3888 in Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) and pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pALL). CAT-8015 exhibited a greater affinity for CD22 than its predecessor, CAT-3888 and CAT's language such as \\"CAT will support the NCI's ongoing development of CAT-3888...\\" suggested at the time that their focus was on the second generation candidate. CAT was acquired by AstraZeneca, who also acquired MedImmune, combining the two into a biologics division. MedImmune renamed CAT-8015 to moxetumomab pasudotox. On 16 May 2013, AstraZeneca announced that CAT-8015 had started Phase III clinical trials.  History  On 5 December 2008, orphan designation (EU/3/08/592) was granted by the European Commission to Medimmune Limited, United Kingdom, for murine anti-CD22 antibody variable region fused to truncated Pseudomonas exotoxin 38 for the treatment of hairy cell leukaemia. It was renamed to Moxetumomab pasudotox. The sponsorship was transferred to AstraZeneca AB, Sweden, in January 2019. On 17 July 2013, orphan designation (EU/3/13/1150) was granted by the European Commission to MedImmune Ltd, United Kingdom, for moxetumomab pasudotox for the treatment of B-lymphoblastic leukaemia / lymphoma. The sponsorship was transferred to AstraZeneca AB, Sweden, in January 2019. Moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk was approved for use in the United States in September 2018. The efficacy of moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk was studied in a single-arm, open-label clinical trial of 80 subjects who had received prior treatment for hairy cell leukemia with at least two systemic therapies, including a purine nucleoside analog. The trial measured durable complete response (CR), defined as maintenance of hematologic remission for more than 180 days after achievement of CR. Thirty percent of subjects in the trial achieved durable CR, and the overall response rate (number of subjects with partial or complete response to therapy) was 75 percent. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the application for moxetumomab pasudotox fast track, priority review, and orphan drug designations. The FDA granted the approval of Lumoxiti to AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals.

For label updates see FDA index page for BLA 125504 It inhibits a member of the cytokine family, interleukin 17A.  Medical uses  Secukinumab is used to treat psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, and psoriatic arthritis. It is given by subcutaneous injection and is sold in a pre-filled syringe or autoinjector that can be used at home and as a lyophilized powder for use in hospitals and clinics. Secukinumab was not tested in pregnant women; animal studies did not show harm at relevant doses. The US Food and Drug Administration advises that the drug should be used in pregnant women only if the risk to the fetus is justified by the potential benefit; the European Medicines Agency (EMA) advises that women should not become pregnant while taking it. Secukinumab should not be given to people with active infections since it suppresses the immune system. In the European Union, secukinumab is indicated for the treatment of: * moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults, children and adolescents from the age of six years who are candidates for systemic therapy. * active psoriatic arthritis in adults, alone or in combination with methotrexate (MTX), when the response to previous disease modifying anti rheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy has been inadequate. * active ankylosing spondylitis in adults who have responded inadequately to conventional therapy. * active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with objective signs of inflammation as indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence in adults who have responded inadequately to non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  Adverse effects  Very common (greater than 10% of people experience them) adverse effects include upper respiratory tract infections. Common (between 1% and 10% of people experience them) include oral herpes, runny nose, and diarrhea. In clinical trials there were rare instances of hypersensitivity reactions, severe infections, and some cases of serious inflammatory bowel disease, some of which were new and some of which were exacerbations of existing conditions. Caution should be used when starting secukinumab in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, and patients being treated with secukinumab should be monitored for signs and symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.Front Immunol. 2012 Jun 4;3:129  Pharmacology  Secukinumab inhibits a member of the cytokine family, interleukin 17A, which is produced mainly by inflammatory T helper 17 cells. IL17A is upregulated in serum of people with psoriasis and in the synovial fluid of people with psoriatic arthritis, and promotes inflammation when it binds to the interleukin-17 receptor which is expressed in various types of cells, including keratinocytes in skin. It is mostly eliminated by being taken up into cells via endocytosis and being broken down inside them.  Chemistry  Secukinumab is a recombinant fully human IgG1/kappa monoclonal antibody and is manufactured in Chinese hamster ovary cells.  History  Secukinumab was discovered and developed by Novartis using developmental name AIN457, and the first publication was a Phase I trial published in 2010. In January 2015, secukinumab was approved in the United States and in the European Union to treat adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.

There are four species described; one species is from the Isle of Fur in Denmark, two are from the McAbee Fossil Beds in British Columbia, Canada, and the fourth from the Bol‚Äôshaya Svetlovodnaya fossil site in Russia. The queens of this genus are large, the mandibles are elongated and the eyes are well developed; a stinger is also present. The behaviour of these ants would have been similar to that of extant Myrmeciinae ants, such as solitary foraging for arthropod prey and never leaving pheromone trails. The alates were poor flyers due to their size, and birds and animals most likely preyed on these ants. Ypresiomyrma is not assigned to any tribe, and is instead generally regarded as incertae sedis within Myrmeciinae. However, some authors believe Ypresiomyrma should be assigned as incertae sedis within Formicidae. History and classification Fossils of Ypresiomyrma were first studied and described by Bruce Archibald, Stefan Cover and Corrie Moreau of the Museum of Comparative Zoology in Cambridge, Massachusetts. They published their 2006 description of the genus and species in an Annals of the Entomological Society of America journal article. The genus name is a combination of Ypresian, referring to the age of the specimens and the Greek ', meaning \\"ant\\". The minimum fossil age is approximately 54.5 to 55.5 million years. Along with the genus description, the paper contained descriptions of the type species Ypresiomyrma orbiculata and Ypresiomyrma bartletti, both from the McAbee Fossil Beds in British Columbia, part of the Eocene Okanagan Highlands lake system. Archibald, Cover and Moreau also included a redescription of the Danish species Pachycondyla rebekkae under the new name combination Ypresiomyrma rebekkae. A fourth species, Ypresiomyrma orientalis was described in 2015. Archibald and colleagues originally classified Ypresiomyrma as incertae sedis (Latin for \\"of uncertain placement\\") within the ant subfamily Myrmeciinae, as the ants could not be identified to any tribe level. However, a 2008 paper by Cesare Baroni Urbani of the University of Basel, Switzerland, expressed doubt that members of Ypresiomyrma were even ants. He notes that the development of the malar area (an area between the compound eyes and the mandibles) was different and not reduced, as a reduced malar is synapomorphic (key diagnostic traits) in Myrmeciinae. Baroni Urbani further notes that the antennae's shape on the type species could not be properly determined, making its true placement within Formicidae indeterminable. However, the antennae of Y. rebekkae has an elongated scape which means the fossil is definitely an ant, as this feature is a key diagnostic trait for Formicidae. Due to this, Baroni Urbani believed that Ypresiomyrma could only be confidently classified as incertae sedis within the family Formicidae. A subsequent report by Russian palaeoentomologist Gennady M. Dlussky describing new myrmecines accepted the classification of Archibald and colleagues without mentioning the comments of Baroni Urbani. The following cladogram generated by Archibald and colleagues show the possible phylogenetic position of Ypresiomyrma among some ants of the subfamily Myrmeciinae. The genus may be closely related to other extinct Myrmeciinae genera, including Avitomyrmex and Macabeemyrma, and the extant Nothomyrmecia macrops. Description There are several characteristics that separate Ypresiomyrma from other ant genera. The waist connecting the thorax and the abdomen in Ypresiomyrma is composed of a single segment. The head in each species varies in shape, and mandibles are a distinct triangular shape and shorter than the head capsule with eight to twelve teeth, although they are elongated. Queens of the genus are large, measuring over . Other characters include large, well developed eyes, a rounded propodeal dorsum and a noticeable stinger. =Y. orbiculata= Artist's reconstruction of Y. orbiculata Y. orbiculata was described from a single part and counterpart compression fossil found at the Middle Ypresian McAbee Fossil Beds, Kamloops Group, near Cache Creek, British Columbia. The type specimens numbered UCCIPR L-18 F-749 and UCCIPR L-18 F-750 for the part and counterpart is currently preserved in the palaeoentomology collections housed at Thompson Rivers University, in Kamloops, British Columbia. Archibald, Cover, and Moreau coined the specific epithet from the Latin \\"orbiculatus\\", meaning \\"rounded\\" or \\"circular\\", in reference to the shape of the head. The species is discernible from the other two species of Ypresiomyrma by its notably rounded head capsule, and by the shape of the petiole which has a smoothly sloping convex shape with a node in the center. The petiole is similar in appearance to Prionomyrmex janzeni, and the propodeum is round. The queen is estimated to have been approximately . The compound eyes are large and oval shape, but the antennae cannot be described due to poor preservation. The mandibles are large, containing seven to eight teeth. A well-developed stinger is also present. =Y. bartletti= The second species described from the McAbee Fossil Beds is Y. bartletti which, like Y. orbiculata, is known from a single queen specimen. The holotype part and counterpart are included in the Geological Survey of Canada, Ottawa collections as GSC 127632a and GSC 127632b. The shape of the head is subtriangular, which separates it from Y. orbiculata, and at an estimated it is smaller than Y. rebekkae. The petiole shape in Y. bartletti is distinct from both other species. The specific epithet was chosen in honor of Rod Bartlett who collected the specimen, and to honor his work with the Vancouver Paleontological Society and the British Columbia Paleontological Alliance. The antennae are not preserved and the eyes cannot be distinguished. The mandibles have around ten or fewer teeth. The forewings of the queen are faintly preserved, and portions of the legs are preserved and disarticulated. Some portions of the gaster are deformed and the specimen appears to be crushed, but the overall morphology of this species justifies its placement within Myrmeciinae. An undescribed worker in the form genus Myrmeciites may possibly be a Y. bartletti ant, but this cannot be confirmed due to its poor preservation. =Y. rebekkae= Complete Y. rebekkae holotype slab This species is known from over 100 specimens collected from the earliest Ypresian √òlst and Fur Formations, found in calcareous rocks. The specimens were first studied and described by Jes Rust and N. M√∏ller Andersen in 1999, and they named the species for Rebekka Madsen who collected the type specimen in September 1994. The holotype and paratype queen described are well preserved, although the legs are missing; the part and counterpart, GMUC No. 1995 8B and GMUC No. 1995 8A are deposited in the Geological Museum of the University of Copenhagen. At that time, Rust and Andersen placed the species into the modern ponerin genus Pachycondyla based on the shape of the abdominal segment VI and lack of dentition on the mandibles. Archibald, Cover, and Moreau moved the species to Ypresiomyrma based on the similarity to the McAbee species, by the shape of the abdominal segment III, which differs from that found in the Ponerinae subfamily genera, and by the morphology of the petiole. Y. rebekkae can be distinguished from other species by the shape of its petiole and the size of its head, being notably larger than Y. bartletti. The ants' somewhat angular head is also different, with other species having a rounded head. The species is known almost exclusively from queens, with only one known male ant assigned to it by Rust and Andersen. The average length of a queen is around , with a robust body. The head is round, and the width and length are the same, measuring . The eyes are oval shaped and developed, located near the middle of the head. The mandibles are triangular and long, with ten teeth present. The antennae are long with 11 segments, and the scape is long. The mesosoma is long and wide. The mesosoma is convex and domed, and the pronotum is short. The petiole is long and in wide, and the gaster is swollen, but this is due to the early taphonomic process (the transition of a decaying organism over time and how it becomes fossilised). A well-developed stinger is present in the fossilized specimens. Only a single complete male is known from all the collected specimens. The body length is shorter in comparison to the queen caste, measuring and it is also more slender. The head and mandibles are small, but the eyes are fully developed and large. The antennae are not preserved, and only small fragments of the legs are present. The gaster is smaller and more elongated, but the genitalia are not preserved. =Y. orientalis= Y. orientalis was described from a part and counterpart holotype and a solitary forewing paratype compression fossil found at the late Eocene Bol‚Äôshaya Svetlovodnaya fossil site, in the Sikhote-Alin area of far-eastern Russia. The type specimens numbered PIN 3429/1109 for the part and counterpart and PIN 3429/1198 are currently preserved in the A.A. Borissiak Paleontological Institute fossil collections of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Dlussky, Rasnitsyn, and Perfilieva coined the specific epithet from the Latin \\"orientalis\\", meaning \\"eastern\\", in reference to the type locality. The species is discernible from Y. rebekkae by its smaller petiole node size. While there are no distinct differences between Y. orientalis and the two Okanagan Highlands species Y. bartletti and Y. orbiculata, the fossils were placed into a new species by Dlussky, Rasnitsyn, and Perfilieva. This is due to the notable time difference between the highlands and Bol‚Äôshaya Svetlovodnaya. Though the possible gyne is incomplete the estimated body length is and the mesosoma is robust. The forewing has closed 1+2r, 3r, rm and mcu cells, with the 3r elongated while the 1+2r is shorted to just over twice as long as wide. Ecology The life habits of Ypresiomyrma would have been similar to that of extant Myrmeciinae ants. Colonies nested in the soil or in trees, making them an arboreal nesting species. Workers were most likely solitary foragers, foraging on the ground or onto low vegetation and trees while preying on arthropods or consuming nectar. Workers most likely did not recruit or lead nestmates to food sources, nor did workers lay down pheromone trails. Ypresiomyrma ants most likely used their large eyes to find prey and for navigational purposes. The abundance of Ypresiomyrma queens collected suggests that these ants mated in swarms, but the alates were poor flyers due to their large size. The morphology of the mandibles indicate they were specialised tools for excavating chambers in soil or wood during colony foundation; their large size and common occurrence in their geographical range would mean they were an important food source to a variety of birds and Paleogene animals that predominately fed on insects.

The most common side effects are muscle spasm, nausea, hair loss, diarrhea, fatigue, high blood sugar, hearing loss, dry skin, altered sense of taste and headache. Teprotumumab should not be used if pregnant, and women of child- bearing potential should have their pregnancy status verified prior to beginning treatment and should be counseled on pregnancy prevention during treatment and for six months following the last dose. It is a human monoclonal antibody developed by Genmab and Roche. It binds to IGF-1R. Teprotumumab was approved for use in the United States in January 2020.  Medical use  In a multicenter randomized trial in patients with active Graves' ophthalmopathy teprotumumab was more effective than placebo. In February 2019, Horizon announced results from a Phase III confirmatory trial evaluating teprotumumab for the treatment of active thyroid eye disease (TED). The study met its primary endpoint, showing more patients treated with teprotumumab compared with placebo had a meaningful improvement in proptosis, or bulging of the eye: 82.9 percent of teprotumumab patients compared to 9.5 percent of placebo patients achieved the primary endpoint of a 2 mm or more reduction in proptosis (p<0.001). Proptosis is the main cause of morbidity in TED. All secondary endpoints were also met and the safety profile was consistent with the Phase II study of teprotumumab in TED. On 10 July 2019, Horizon submitted a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the FDA for teprotumumab for the treatment of active thyroid eye disease (TED). Horizon requested priority review for the application - if so granted (FDA has a 60-day review period to decide) it would result in a max. 6 month review process.  History  Teprotumumab-trbw was approved for use in the United States in January 2020, for the treatment of adults with thyroid eye disease. Teprotumumab was first investigated for the treatment of solid and hematologic tumors, including breast cancer, Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-small cell lung cancer and sarcoma. Although results of Phase I and early Phase II trials showed promise, research for these indications were discontinued in 2009, by Roche. Phase II trials still in progress were allowed to complete, as the development was halted due to business prioritization rather than safety concerns. Teprotumumab was subsequently licensed to River Vision Development Corporation in 2012, for research in the treatment of ophthalmic conditions. Horizon Pharma (now Horizon Therapeutics, from hereon Horizon) acquired RVDC in 2017, and will continue clinical trials. It is in Phase III trials for Graves' ophthalmopathy (also known as thyroid eye disease (TED)) and Phase I for diabetic macular edema. It was granted Breakthrough Therapy, Orphan Drug Status and Fast Track designations by the FDA for Graves' ophthalmopathy. Teprotumumab-trbw was approved based on the results of two clinical trials (Trial 1/ NCT01868997 and Trial 2/ NCT03298867) of 170 subjects with active thyroid eye disease who were randomized to either receive teprotumumab-trbw or a placebo. Of the subjects who were administered Tepezza, 71% in Study 1 and 83% in Study 2 demonstrated a greater than two millimeter reduction in proptosis (eye protrusion) as compared to 20% and 10% of subjects who received placebo, respectively. The trials were conducted at 28 sites in Europe and United States. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the application for teprotumumab-trbw fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review designation, and orphan drug designation. The FDA granted the approval of Tepezza to Horizon Therapeutics Ireland DAC.

Tralokinumab was discovered by Cambridge Antibody Technology scientists, using Ribosome Display, as CAT-354 and taken through pre-clinical and early clinical development. After 2007 it has been developed by MedImmune, a member of the AstraZeneca group, where it is currently in Ph3 testing for asthma and Ph2b testing for atopic dermatitis. This makes it one of the few fully internally discovered and developed drug candidates in AstraZeneca's late stage development pipeline.  Discovery and Development  Tralokinumab (CAT-354) was discovered by Cambridge Antibody Technology scientists using protein optimization based on Ribosome Display. They used the extensive data sets from ribosome display to patent protect CAT-354 in a world-first of sequence-activity-relationship claims. In 2004, clinical development of CAT-354 was initiated with this first study completing in 2005. On 21 July 2011, MedImmune LLC initiated a Ph2b, randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the efficacy of tralokinumab in adults with asthma. In 2016, MedImmune and AstraZeneca were developing tralokinumab for asthma (Ph3) and atopic dermatitis (Ph2b) while clinical development for moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) have been discontinued. In July of that year AstraZeneca licensed Tralokinumab to LEO Pharma for skin diseases. A phase 2b study of Tralokinumab found that treatment was associated with early and sustained improvements in atopic dermatitis symptoms and tralokinumab had an acceptable safety and tolerability profile, thereby providing evidence for targeting IL-13 in patients with atopic dermatitis. On 15 June 2017, Leo Pharma announced that they were starting phase 3 clinical trials with tralokinumab in atopic dermatitis.

Both Litvinov and Maisky attempted to attend the conference and transmit declarations. Litvinov was unable to finish reading his at the conference, but he was subsequently able to have it published in the March 1915 issue of the Socialist Standard of the Socialist Party of Great Britain\\"Russia since 1917: Socialist views of Bolshevik policy\\" London, Socialist Party of Great Britain 1948 pp.1‚Äì7 Reports were made by Vailant, Vandervelde and one of the Social Revolutionaries enthusiastically supporting the war. The British apparently abstained from making a report. There was apparently much debate in the drafting commission and the subsequent plenary session on the war responsibility of the Central Powers and the position of Belgium and Serbia. The Belgian and French delegates are reported as taking a harder line on this point than their British comrades. The attitude of the Russians is difficult to ascertain because of contradicting primary sources.Gankin and Fisher pp.275‚Äì278 Maiskys declaration was also endorsed by the Polish Socialist Party Left. The principal source used by the editors was a report in Nashe Slovo No. 21 February 21, 1915, however the editors note that portion of the report regarding the actions of the Social Revolutionaries at the conference were contradicted in another article in by Chernov in Nashe Slovo No. 23 February 24, 1915 Gankin and Fisher pp.277 n. 25, 277 n.28, 278 n. 27 The resolution adopted by the conference claimed that the war was the product of the antagonisms produced by capitalist society, imperialism and colonial rivalry in which every country had a share of responsibility. Given the invasion of Belgium and France, a victory in the war for Germany would extinguish liberty, national independence and faith in treaties. Therefore, the workers of the Allied countries are fighting a defensive war against the German and Austrian governments, not against the German and Austrian people, and would resist attempts to turn this into a war of conquests. The resolution specifically demanded the restoration of Belgium, autonomy or independence for Poland, and the resolution of all the national problems of Europe from Alsace- Lorraine to the Balkans on the basis of national self-determination. After the war they hoped from an end to secret diplomacy, the \\"interest of armaments makers\\" and international compulsory arbitration. > The victory of the Allied Powers must be a victory for popularliberty, for > unity, for independence, and autonomy of nations in the peaceful federation > of the United States of Europe and the world At the end of the resolution the conference condemned the repression against socialist newspapers and parliamentarians in Russia, as well as the national oppression of Finns, Jews and Russian and German Poles.Gankin and Fisher pp.278‚Äì279 A paraphrase is given in Walling, p. 424-426  Paris, March 1917 (canceled)  The French Socialist party called for another meeting of the Entente socialists on 7 August 1916 by a vote of 1,937 to 2, 997 not voting. The purpose of the conference was to focus opinion against annexation and conquest, for the establishment of international agreements for the maintenance of peace after the war and for an economic policy that would not be based on exploitation or contain the germs of a new war. The proposal was endorsed by the Executive Committee of the International Socialist Bureau and votes were to be allotted according to the Second Internationals formula. The proposed conference was set to meet in Paris in March 1917. The organizers of the conference began to have second thoughts, though, when they saw that anti- war socialists might predominate at the conference. They decided to give one of the British Socialist Parties four votes to Henry Hyndmans National Socialist Party and one of the Italian Socialist Party's votes to Benito Mussolinis Fascio. The Italian party then withdrew its decision to participate and called on the International Socialist Commission to give its opinion of the purposed conference. The ISC was for abstaining, but felt it would be useful to call a conference of Entente Zimmerwaldists in order to outline a common policy toward the Paris conference. However, only exile groups in Switzerland, the Bolsheviks, Mensheviks, Socialist Revolutionaries, Polish Socialist Party ‚Äì Left, General Jewish Labour Bund and the group around Vie Ouvrere were able to attend, and they had already declared their opposition to the conference. The meeting of Zimmerwaldists adopted a non-binding resolution recommending abstinence from the Paris conference. The ILP and BSP were still willing, but when the British Labour Party decided to withdraw a few days before the conference was to open, the meeting was cancelled.Gankin and Fisher pp.467‚Äì468, 471‚Äì473 Carl F.

After the Council of Soviets had joined the call for the purposed Stockholm conference and made a tour of Allied capitals to make the case, the necessity of convening an Inter-Allied Socialist Conference before the Stockholm one was seated became more imperative, and the final date was set at a meeting of representatives of the French Socialist Party, the British Labour Party and the Soviets at a meeting in Paris on 20‚Äì30 July.Report of the Seventeenth Annual Conference of the Labour Party p.4 The Second Inter-Allied Socialist Conference took place in London 28‚Äì29 August 1917.

The commissions met early the next day and presented their reports to the conference that afternoon. The commission on Stockholm could not come to a unanimous decision, but the majority report as presented by Ramsay MacDonald which welcomed the convening of the Stockholm conference and particularly supported the seating of minorities. On a motion by Bernard Shaw this was amended to include a condemnation of the refusal of passports by the Allied governments. This resolution, as amended, passed 48‚Äì13, with the Belgian, South African and Greek delegates voting against and the British Trades Union Congress and the majority French socialists not voting.Report of the Seventeenth Annual Conference of the Labour Party pp.8‚Äì10 Details on the votes from Gankin and Fisher pp.602‚Äì603. The minority report, and a list of its sponsors, is available in Pendant la Guerre pp.183‚Äì187 The report of the commission on war aims presented by Sidney Webb simply stated that no unanimity could be reached as the commission was presented with six or seven different statements on war aims: a Franco-Belgian statement, a Russian statement, a Portuguese statement, one from the British Socialist Party, a Labour Party statement with an additional memorandum by the ILP and statements of the Italians. The commission recommended that the conference appoint a standing committee of Allied Socialist Parties with a view to arranging another conference. This decision was narrowly approved by the majority of the conference, with each country being allowed two representatives. The second commission also suggested sending either a deputation or a letter to President Woodrow Wilson, but this was withdrawn after strong opposition. There was also a suggestion that the congress be allowed to continue a third day but the conference divided equally on the proposal 21-21 and the chair ruled the proposal not carried.Report of the Seventeenth Annual Conference of the Labour Party p.10  London, February 1918  Discussion among the Entente socialist parties on war aims continued through February 1918. The issue was tackled in party conferences, memorandums, and informal talks. On 20 September, the Blackpool congress of the British TUC passed a resolution stating that the Stockholm conference would not be successful at this time, but called on their Parliamentary Committee to take steps for an agreement on war aims among the allied workers and that an eventual general congress should be called on the basis of the agreed war aims. A sub-committee of the Parliamentary Committee and the Labour Party executive met and worked out a memorandum of war aims which was ratified at a meeting of societies affiliated with the TUC and Labour Party in London on 28 December 1917 and presented to Prime Minister David Lloyd George. War aims statements then made by the Prime Minister and President Wilson were approved \\"as far as they agreed with the memorandum\\" by the Nottingham conference of the Labour Party on 23 January 1918 which also urged the convening of another Inter-Allied conference and an eventual general conference to assemble in a neutral country, preferably Switzerland.Report of the Seventeenth Annual Conference of the Labour Party pp. 11‚Äì12, 105‚Äì106. The text of this memorandum is available in British Labor and the War New York: Boni and Liveright 1919, pp. 343‚Äì351 The French, meanwhile, corresponded with Henderson on the question of future conferences and based their peace term on the answers to the Dutch-Scandinavian questionnaire and the declaration of the first Inter-Allied conference.Pendant la Guerre p. 193‚Äì194 At the Nottingham conference, Paul Reynauld informally agreed that the draft memorandum on peace terms would be submitted to the National Council of the French Party and CGT on 17 February, and that continuous talks on the details of the memorandum should continue in Paris. He also stated that the Belgian Party would be able to adhere to the main lines of the memorandum and every effort should be used to secure the concurrence of other allied labor groups.Report of the Seventeenth Annual Conference of the Labour Party pp. 126 The conference met in London from 20 to 24 February 1918. The organizations represented at the conference included: the British Labour Party and Trade Union Congress; the Belgian Workers Party; the French Socialist Party ‚Äì SFIO and General Confederation of Labor; Italian Reformist Socialist Party and Italian Socialist Party. Consultative delegates were present from South Africa, Romania and the \\"South Slav organizations\\". Messages of support came in from groups in New Zealand, Portugal, Romania, South Africa and the Russian Social Revolutionary Party. Camille Huysmans read a communication from delegates of the Menshevik and Social Revolutionary Parties stating that they had been refused passports by the Bolshevik government.British Labor and the War pp.61‚Äì62 The conference was opened by J. W. Ogden of the TUC Parliamentary committee. At the opening session Albert Thomas announced that the French Party and C.G.T. had endorsed the British draft memorandum almost unanimously. Capeta, on behalf of the Italian reformists, stated that he had held informal talks with the Yugoslav delegation and they had come to an agreement over amendments to the memorandum affecting their frontiers. The conference formed five commissions: on a League of Nations (Renaudel, chairman, MacDonald, secretary); Territories (Sidney Webb, Jean Longuet, ditto); Publicity and Drafting (Thomas, G. H. Stuart-Bunning, ditto); the International Conference (Henderson, de Brouckere) and Economic conditions (J.H. Thomas).British Labor and the War pp.63‚Äì65 The conference adopted a detailed memorandum on war aims. After endorsing and quoting in full the resolution of the first Inter-Allied Socialist conference, the memorandum planned post war from a \\"supernational authority\\" in the form of a League of Nations, which would have the power to enforce the decisions of a World Court regarding international disputes and conduct elections for the purpose of national self-determination. There would also be an International Legislature in which each \\"civilised state would have their allotted share\\" that would pass binding international law.British Labor and the War pp. 353‚Äì354 This implied a complete democratisation of all existing states including removal of \\"arbitrary powers\\", elected parliaments, publication of all treaties, abolition of secret diplomacy and the responsibility of foreign policy to the legislature. Other elements included the abolition of compulsory military service in all countries, concerted disarmament and the nationalization of defense industries.British Labor and the War pp. 354‚Äì355 A long list of specific territorial goals was also drawn up, including the restoration of Belgium, the settlement of the question of Alsace-Loraine by popular vote, a Balkan Federation, settlement of the differences between Italy on the basis of mutual respect and popular sovereignty and restoration of Poland. Palestine was to be put under temporary international control and opened to Jewish immigration, the other former Turkish territory and Africa \\"north of the Zambezi and south of the Sahara\\" were likewise to by international protectorates until their populations were ready for self-government and the Dardanelles made a neutral zone.British Labor and the War pp.357‚Äì361 The memorandum finally called for a halt to economic warfare and protectionism, while also recognizing the right of countries to create their own trade laws, international action to prevent famine and other dislocations caused by the end of the war, restitution for victims of the war and punishment of war crimes. The final portion of the memorandum included a call for a new general conference of labor and socialist parties of all countries to be held concurrently with the peace conference and for the representation of labor at the peace conference.British Labor and the War pp. 362‚Äì366  London, Sept. 1918  The final conference met in London 17‚Äì19 September 1918. The credentials committee received 86 credentials, 74 of which were accepted as full delegates. The conference was pointedly billed as a Socialist and Labor Conference, allowing Pure and Simple trades unions like the AFL and TLC to take part.Proceedings of the Inter-allied labor conference (with appendix) Washington, D.C., Published by the American federation of labor, 1918 pp.1, 30 Delegates came from a variety of countries, some of which had not been represented at war time socialist conferences yet. All information on the delegates is taken from this source, as well as others noted Serbia was represented by Du≈°an A. Popoviƒá of the Serbian Social Democratic Party; Greece by Petridis of the General Labor Federation of the Piraeus;from the United States, representing the American Federation of Labor were Samuel Gompers, John P. Frey, William Bowen, Edgar Wallace and Charles Baine;American Federation of Labor Report of proceedings of the 39th annual convention of the American federation of labor Washington, Law Reporter Printing Co. 1919 p.261 the Trades and Labour Congress of Canada sent a single delegate; Romania and Transylvania were represented by a \\"National committee\\" which appointed two delegates whom the credentials committee gave consultative status; the Italians were represented by three delegates from the Socialist Union, one from Italian Union of Labor and five from the Democratia Sociale Irredenta, a group of pro-Allied Italian socialists in Austrian Tyrol, who were given consultative status; Great Britain had the largest delegations, with 24 delegates from the Labour Party and 18 from the Trade Union Congress, including Ramsay MacDonald, Sidney Webb, Arthur Henderson; France supplied six each from the SFIO and the CGT; there were six representatives of the Belgian Workers Party and two from the Union of Belgian Workers in France, which included Huysmans, de Broukere and Vandervelde. The status of the Russian delegation was the subject of some dispute on the first day of the conference. Some believed that those delegates, should they arrive, not be seated because Russia had left the Allies, while others believed that no Russian party should be seated because knowledge of conditions there was so unreliable. In any case the Soviet authorities would not let the representatives of the Mensheviks or Social Revolutionaries attend the conference but two communications were received, one from Roubanovich, the other from Axelrod, Gavronsky, Rousanoff and Soukholine. Alexander Kerensky was seated as a \\"guest\\".Proceedings of the Inter-allied labor conference (with appendix) pp.2, 3‚Äì4, 16 The first day was taken up with electing commissions. First were the credential and procedures commissions, which reported that day and then commissions on war aims, international relations and for drafting a final statement were elected. There was some debate over what method of voting would be used, Longuet objecting to the use of the allotment used in Socialist congresses because of the absence of the American Socialist Party as well as the official Italian party and CGT, but the issue was not resolved.Proceedings of the Inter-allied labor conference (with appendix) pp.4‚Äì7 The second day was taken up largely with the presentation of British and American draft war aims proposals and introduction of resolutions to be sent to the various commissions.Proceedings of the Inter- allied labor conference (with appendix) pp.8‚Äì18 The third meeting received the reports of the commission on international relations. A report on the Peace Note was adopted unanimously, albeit after reservations were made by several delegates.Proceedings of the Inter-allied labor conference (with appendix) pp.19‚Äì20, 21‚Äì24 The report on the situation in Russia was more controversial. Two reports came out of the Commission, both of which condemned the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and asked the post war peace conference to \\"secure the complete freedom of the Russian people\\", however the majority report condemned the Allied intervention, while the minority supported it. The minority report was signed by two Americans, Blaine and Wallace, while the majority was signed by Henderson, Hill, Huysmans, Vandervelde, Longuet, Renaudel, Rosoni, Rossetti and Popovitch. Debate on this raged through the afternoon session of 19 September, and included a speech by Kerensky in which he pleaded for western socialists to support the anti-Bolshevik governments in Russia. It was finally decided to send the matter back to the committee.Proceedings of the Inter- allied labor conference (with appendix) pp.20‚Äì21, 24‚Äì30 On the final day of the conference a compromise resolution was turned in, repeating the first two paragraphs of both resolutions and adding a new third paragraph which stated that the allied intervention should be carried out in conformity with article 6 of the 14 points and should have as its object only the restoration of peace and democracy to Russia. This compromise resolution passed 25‚Äì20, on a show of hands. Popovitch and Longuet attempted to deliver statements on their opposition to the resolution, but were overruled. This led to great consternation on the part of the French delegates who then demanded that voting be on the basis of former Socialist conferences with the US awarded 20 votes. It was decided that if any delegate objected to a vote by a show of hands, they would use the former system.Proceedings of the Inter-allied labor conference (with appendix) pp.36‚Äì37 The commission on war aims adopted a statement that combined elements of the British and American proposals and the fourteen points. There was opposition to this report by Popovitch and Kneeshaw, who did not regard the war necessarily as one between freedom and despotism, and two amendments were offered to change the wording over the circumstances in which they would meet representatives of the German SPD, both of which were voted down.Proceedings of the Inter-allied labor conference (with appendix) pp.31‚Äì36, 38‚Äì45 On the final vote of the war aims statement was then held FOR the full textProceedings of the Inter-allied labor conference (with appendix) p.46 *Italy....7 *Belgium.12 *France..18 *Britain.20 Total..57 Against the full text *Serbia....7 *Greece...12 *France....2 Total..10 Abstaining *American Federation of Labor *Trades and Labour Congress of Canada  See also  *Vienna Socialist Conference of 1915 *Neutral Socialist Conferences during the First World War  References  Category:History of socialism Category:Second International Category:World War I socialist conferences ","title":"Inter-Allied Socialist Conferences of World War I"},{"id":"33024230","text":"Andr√© Lu√≠s Volpe Miele (born 12 April 1987) (also spelled Andre Miele), is a tennis player from Brazil.

She is often featured in Gripped Magazine and contributes to The Collective (a multi-climber website). She has also been featured in several international magazines and websites and her image has been used in advertising, magazine galleries, and magazine covers. Thomasina is also a mother (her daughter Cedar travels around with her), a doula, sews and sells clothing, shopping bags, and other crafts, and works as a photographer. She is one of 5 athletes to be featured in The Season 2, a 22 episode web TV show running this fall.The Season 2, a 22 episode web tv show running this fallhttp://www.theseasontv.com/ Beginnings Pidgeon started climbing near Flatrock in her early 20s on a trip home to her native Newfoundland. Soon after she moved to Whistler, British Columbia, and climbed occasionally at small local sport climbing areas like Nordic Rock and Rogue's Gallery while working several jobs with the goal of visiting Europe for an extended trip. With the money she'd saved she got a working visa and went on a year-and-a- half long trip to Wales, Ireland, parts of Eastern Europe, and Morocco. She learned to traditional climb in Wales, but most of the trip was spent visiting new places. She returned to Canada, moved to Kelowna, and began studying sciences at Okangon University College. She continued climbing while in school and after a year and a half she moved to Vancouver to work and climb as much as possible. She got a job at Mountain Equipment Co-op and began climbing at The Edge climbing gym in Vancouver. She injured her shoulder, kept climbing on it, and eventually was unable to lift her arm above shoulder level. After a year off of climbing her arm had not improved so she visited a physio- therapist and with the exercises he taught her she was able to strengthen her shoulder and climb again. She began spending much of her time outside on the boulders at the base of the world-famous granite monolith \\"The Chief\\" in Squamish, BC. Commitment Pidgeon quickly became integrated into the Squamish climbing community and in 2001 she moved to Squamish, where she currently lives in a van https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british- columbia/camper-van-bylaws-surrey-reactions-1.5351093, to live and climb as much as she possibly could. Bouldering In her first decade of climbing Pidgeon quickly became one of the most progressive female boulderers in the world, opening the doors to the harder grades by making First Female Ascents (FFAs, not to be confused with the traditional usage of FFA in climbing)(FFAs)http://www.urbanclimbermag.com/themag/features/the_x_factor/index4.html of many double digit problems. V10 - In 2001 Pidgeon made an ascent of Zero Zero in Squamish, BC. The problem had previously been climbed by American climber Tiffany Campbell. Pidgeon had only climbed a handful of harder moderates at the time and for a climber of her level, much less a female climber, to try a V10 was considered ridiculous. Nevertheless, Pidgeon picked her project and after only a handful of days of effort she sent the problem. It was one of the first female V10 ascents in the world and the first by a Canadian woman. It was another year before Pidgeon began climbing V10 again, but that year was quite productive with ascents in Squamish, Hueco Tanks (Texas), Bishop (California), Little Cottonwood Canyon (Utah), and an area in Nova Scotia. 2004 saw two more ascents and 2005 one. In 2006 Thomasina became pregnant with her daughter Cedar and did not begin climbing seriously again until 2008 when Cedar was old enough to travel. That year Thomasina made four more V10 ascents. Since then she has kept up the pace, sending several V10 and harder problems each year. As of August 2011 she has sent over 40 V10s. V11 - Pidgeon was the first Canadian woman and one of the first women in North America to climb V11. As of August 2011 she has done over 20 V11s, almost all FFAs. Her first was \\"The Egg\\" (FFA) in Squamish in 2008. She quickly followed that ascent with Water Hazard (2nd ascent, FFA, Bishop), La Belette (FFA Bishop), Lucky Charms (FFA Squamish), and Beefy Gecko (Bishop), all in 2008. In 2009 she managed \\"Encore En Fois\\" (Squamish), and in 2010 she went back on the road and did 8 more V11s, 7 of which were FFAs. Perhaps most impressive was her FFA and 2nd try ascent of \\"The Hand\\" in Hueco. V12 - Pidgeon was the first Canadian woman and one of the first women in North America to have climbed V12, and she is still one of only a few female boulderers in the world to have climbed multiple V12 boulder problems. To date she has done 7 V12s-- \\"The Butterpumper\\" (FFA Hueco Tanks, February 2009), \\"Rumble in the Jungle\\" (Hueco Tanks, March 2009), \\"Barefoot on Sacred Ground\\" (FFA Hueco Tanks, January 2010), \\"Summoning Sit\\" \\"Summoning Sit\\" http://www.dpmclimbing.com/articles/view/puccio-pidgeon-and-payne-make- pulling-double-digits-look-easy(FFA Squamish, June 2010),http://www.up- climbing.com/en/news/boulder/8a--ffas-for-alex-puccio-and-thomasina-pidgeon \\"Sur Le Tois\\" (FFA, Squamish, September 2010), \\"Beautiful Gecko\\"http://www.urbanclimbermag.com/411/news/another_v12_for_pidgeon/ (FFA since break, Bishop, March 2011), and \\"The Aquarium\\"\\"The Aquarium\\"http://www.up-climbing.com/en/news/boulder/pidgeon-sent-beautiful- gecko-8a--video (FFA Bishop, March 2011).Bishop, March 201 http://climbingnarc.com/2011/03/news-notes-3222011/ She has also done two slash grade (V11/12) problems -- \\"Sarah Sit\\" (Hueco Tanks, 2004), and \\"Chablanke\\" (Hueco Tanks, February 2010).

Wegefarth County, Texas was named after him, and he was the father of Harry M. Wegeforth, founder of the Zoological Society of San Diego and San Diego Zoo.  Biography  A court stenographer in southwest Germany, Wegefarth traveled over 300 miles on foot through winter snow to stowaway on a ship bound for the United States. Arriving in Baltimore, he traveled by foot to Pittsburgh, where he took a job as a clerk in a dry goods store. Twelve years later he launched his own oil refining business and traveled to London and Paris to demonstrate coal oil lamps, helping to forge the market for coal oil in Europe. Twice a widower, with six sons by his first two marriages, Wegefarth married Mary Elizabeth MacArthur in 1867. The couple settled in Baltimore and had seven children: Sons Arthur, George, Paul, Harry, and Charles; and daughters Emma and Ellen.Wegeforth and Morgan, p. 18‚Äì19. Wegefarth served as president of the Texas Immigrant Aid and Supply Company, and Wegefarth County, Texas, which was established on June 2, 1873, was named after him (the county was abolished August 21, 1876 by an act of the Texas Legislature which established new counties across the Texas Panhandle). He gambled heavily in oil development, and was bankrupt by 1873. All five of Wegefarth and MacArthur's sons went into the field of medicine. Charles drowned in the late 1890s, while Arthur, Paul, and Harry all relocated to San Diego between 1910 and 1915 to open medical practices.Wegeforth and Morgan, p. 32. There, Harry changed the spelling of the family name to Wegeforth and went on to found the Zoological Society of San Diego and San Diego Zoo in 1916.

Today it houses the town's museum ‚Äì operated by Harrogate Borough Council. It was formerly a spa water pump house. It is located in Crown Place in the western part of Harrogate town centre, opposite the town's Valley Gardens park. It is bounded by two streets, Crescent Road and Royal Parade. Today, the Pump Room consists of both the original 1842 stone rotunda and a glazed annexe which was opened in 1913. The Pump Room offered guests of the town an all weather facility where they could drink sulphur water which was pumped on site from a natural spring known as the Old Sulphur Well. The building also had a social element to it as it provided guests with a place to meet friends and get to know others. The museum The Royal Pump Room The Pump Room, and its later Annexe, were renovated in the early 1950s and it first opened as the new town museum in 1953. Today The Royal Pump Room Museum is owned and operated by Harrogate Borough Council. The museum underwent extensive renovations between 1985 and 1987. During the work many features of the buildings including the main building and Annexe's copper roof were restored. In addition, the Old Sulphur Well's wellhead and the surviving original water serving counter were restored. The 1980s overhaul also created new exhibition areas and improved the on-site facilities. The majority of the museum tells the story of Harrogate as a spa and a centre for rest and recuperation. The council-owned collection now consists of approximately 20,000 items. The first donations and endowments came from local private collections and some items were first donated to Harrogate Corporation in the 1850s. Amongst the exhibits relating to Harrogate as a spa town are a number of recreated treatment rooms using salvaged original fixtures. These dioramas recreate the Hydrotherapy facilities, such as the Vichy bath rooms that were to be found in the nearby Royal Baths. Visitors can also see a wheeled mahogany bath which was once used for giving sulphurous peat baths. It was discovered intact during the 1970s despite being left abandoned for many years and buried near the site of The Royal Baths. The museum's 19th century Bath chair was still used by bath chair proprietor Mr Robinson until he retired in 1931. These wheeled covered chairs were once a common sight in 19th century Harrogate and they were even fairly common in the 1920s. Bath chairs could be hired by guests from a rank of chairs and then bath chair men would push visitors from the rank to the various hotels and spa buildings. Recently a number of glass Hamilton style bottle - often known as ‚Äòtorpedo‚Äô bottles - which all bare the inscription \\"bottled at the Royal Pump Room, Harrogate\\", were donated to the museum. Very few of these unusually shaped Victorian bottles have survived. They now form part of the display of the Pump Room's bottling room. This display serves as a reminder that there was a wider social and economic significance of the Pump Room. Strong Sulphur Water was once bottled and exported as medicinal spring water for consumption throughout the country. The museum also regularly displays a selection of period costumes from its sizeable and historically significant collection of clothing. In 2014, dresses from the museum's collections appeared on show in the Classical Dress Timeless Style exhibition which explored the influence of fashions of Ancient Greece and other aspects of the Classical World on dress makers from the 19th and 20th centuries. Another important element of the museum's displays are artefacts from the Ancient World. The museum is noted for its Ancient Egyptian and Ancient Greek artefacts which were collected by local antiquarians such as Robert Ogden and the Kent family of Tatefield Hall which is located near Beckwithshaw. The Egyptology collection includes a well- preserved sarcophagus, a unique cartonnage mask of Anubis, Stele gravestones, pre-dynastic pottery and other artefacts from later periods of Ancient Egypt. Anubis Mask from Harrogate - left three quarter profile - HARGM10686 02 =Exhibitions at the museum= There is a regular programme of special exhibitions. These make use of the core council-owned collection and loaned items. In 2014 a Great War centenary exhibition was held which featured numerous artefacts and personal memorabilia belonging to local people who served in the conflict. In late 2013 the Royal Pump Room displayed some of the costumes from ITV's period drama Downton Abbey. The exhibition, which ran from October to December 2013, proved to be an outstanding success. =Children and young people and the museum= The museum welcomes numerous school parties from around Yorkshire. There is a well-established education programme for the various subjects covered by the National Curriculum. The museum provides workshops on subjects such as Egyptology, toys through time and also local history. The nearby Mercer Art Gallery houses the school activity room. Costumed period re-enactors sometimes interpret a particular period of history for schoolchildren. For families with children there is also a children's activity area, that includes colouring sheets, loanable activity backpacks and other trail and quiz sheets. During the summer holidays there are special object handling sessions and other educational activities for children. The Pump Room's history and historical context =Discovery of mineral waters in Harrogate= The Tewit Well, Harrogate's first well. Now covered with the Pump Room's original rotunda The Tewit Well on the Stray was discovered by William Slingsby (uncle of Sir William Slingsby) in 1596. Edmund Deane a physician of York provides evidence that by 1626 the waters of Harrogate's Tewit Well were being used for medicinal purposes. He referred to the well as \\"The English Spa\\". He compared the waters of the Tewit Well with those of Spa in present- day Belgium, which even by Deane's day, was already a popular place where spring water was being consumed for health reasons. =History of the site of the Royal Pump Room= The waters from the natural spring upon which the Pump Room is built upon contains the greatest amount of sulphur of all of Harrogate's many water springs. The water from the Old Sulphur Well was termed Strong Sulphur Water to distinguish it from sulphurous waters from the town's other wells. Betty Lupton (c.1760‚Äì1843), dispensed Strong Sulphur Water from a well for approximately six decades at the Pump Room's present site. She retired in 1843, just as the Pump Room was completed. According to a contemporary newspaper obituary, she died on 22 August 1843 and was said to be 83 years old. It is known that in 1837, she was given the honorary title 'The Queen of the Well'. This title was held by several different women who were all water servers at the Old Sulphur Well. Water servers such as Betty were elected and then crowned each May. It is unclear when this tradition finally ended, but it is known a Mrs Anne Watson, held the title 'The Queen of the Well' after Betty Lupton had died. In the present day museum visitors can look down into the Pump Room's basement. There they can see an 18th century stone well-head for the Old Sulphur Well. It is of an unusual design and features arched openings with a tented roof structure which apparently was to protect the marble basin underneath. It is thought the marble basin was an original feature of the well head. In 1986 another long disused well shaft, which was thought to also date from the 18th century, was rediscovered and reopened by workmen during the refurbishment the Royal Pump Room museum. =The original 1842 building of the Royal Pump Room= The Royal Pump Room, view across the park The octagonal colonnaded building was designed by Isaac Thomas Shutt whose family owned the Swan Hotel. It was designed to accommodate 150 people. Apparently Shutt's design was not supported by all of Harrogate's Commissioners and four prominent builders and innkeepers of the town resigned in protest of Shutt's design being chosen. The building was completed in 1842 and the project is said to have costed ¬£2,249 and 7 shillings. According to the British National Archive's online historical Currency Converter, this sum of money in 1840 would be the equivalent of spending ¬£99,196 in 2005 Currency Converter (1270-1970). The Pump Room was the first project of the newly formed Harrogate Improvement Commissioners, whose aim was to provide a suitable building to house the Old Sulphur Well. The previous structure that was built on the site in the first decade of the 19th century was dismantled and re- erected over the Tewit Well. The Pump Room has four projecting side bays with windows and Corinthian pillars. On one of the walls of the building there is an inscribed panel bearing the town's Latin motto Arx celebris fontibus which can translate as \\"A citadel noted for its springs\\". The octagonal ogee dome is covered with copper tiles which replaced the original lead roof. In the centre of the roof there is an architectural feature known as a lantern which lets light down into the building. = Drinking the waters and the outside tap = In the heyday of the Pump Room, guests would arrive early in the morning from 7 am until about 9.30 am in order to drink one or two glasses of water. This was all done before they had any breakfast. After entering the building they would pay an attendant for their sulphur water. The water was traditionally served in glasses from a wooden counter. Visitors to the pump room were charged for drinking its water inside the building. Hollins' Handbook for Harrogate stated that an Act of Parliament governed the price of the water from the Pump Room. For an individual it would cost 1 shilling to drink sulphur water at the Pump Room for a week. A family could drink the waters at the Pump Room for the same duration at a cost of 4 shillings. However, legislation from as early as 1841 stated that Strong Sulphur Water was to be made available for free to those who could not afford it. The Harrogate Improvement Commissioners Board's 1841 Harrogate Act established the principle that the poor should not be excluded from the perceived medicinal benefits of Harrogate's sulphur water. In order to conform to the act the Pump Room provided an outside tap which anyone could use at any time. After 9.30 am the Pump Room's attendants stopped serving well water inside the building. From this time onward the outside tap was the only source of well water. In the early days of the building an attendant supervised the tap. This tap still exists today and it still works, although it is not recommended to try the water, due to the health risks involved. The Pump Room's outside tap with sulphur deposits and staining visible and health warning sign =The Pump Room becomes fashionable= During the heyday of the Pump Room music recitals were often held inside the building to entertain visitors. People from many different social backgrounds would travel from various parts of Great Britain and even Europe, to drink the pump room‚Äôs water. In the 19th century sulphur water was seen as a means to effectively alleviate the symptoms of illnesses such as gout and lumbago. Drinking the water at the Royal Pump Room was seen as an integral part of what later became known as \\"The Harrogate cure\\". During their stay in the town, guests also visited Harrogate's Royal Baths to partake in various other treatments such as hot mineral water bath treatments, mud and sulphur rich peat baths to try to improve their health. In addition rest, exercise and relaxation became an integral part of the Harrogate cure. =Increased popularity of Harrogate Spa Water and the Royal Pump Room= The number of people recorded as having drank Harrogate's spa waters rose at an astonishing rate during the mid 19th century. For example, it was believed during 1842 Harrogate had received 3,778 visitors who had come to drink the water. By 1867 this figure stood at 11,626. The Pump Room is said to have regularly seen about 15,000 visitors a year through its doors at the peak of its popularity during the late 19th century and early 20th century. =The 1913 Annexe building= Royal Pump Room Annexe's exterior The continued popularity of Harrogate's spa waters created the need to expand the Pump Room building. By the 1900s, the Royal Pump Room was experiencing overcrowding on a regular basis. Initially a small temporary structure was erected alongside the 1842 building in an attempt to alleviate the overcrowding. This measure apparently proved to be unsatisfactory to guests and failed to solve the problem. After much public debate on how to deal with the problem, Harrogate Corporation decided to add a permanent extension which would be connected to the 1842 building. In around 1912‚Äì13 the new annexe, which was designed by Leonard Clarke (architect), was built. Clarke's elegant design was fully glazed and had a roof tiled with ornate copper fishtail tiles which complement the original building's copper tiles. David Burnett, the then current Lord Mayor of London who also later became the 1st Baronet Burnett of Selborne House, travelled to Harrogate to conduct the annexe's opening ceremony on 7 June 1913. Sadly and somewhat ironically barely a year after the annexe's opening the First World War had broken out. This resulted in a dramatic and rapid fall in the visitor numbers who were coming to Harrogate as a whole. The Pump Room never recovered from this event and visitor numbers never went back to their pre First World War levels following the return of peace. =The later decades of the Royal Pump Room and closure= Although Harrogate had 259,000 visitors in 1925, who were all recorded as having come to Harrogate with the specific intention to drink the town's spa waters, the Royal Pump Room and other such wells began experiencing a decline in popularity as the interwar period progressed. The Great Depression and the economic hardships that followed in its wake had a major effect on visitor numbers to Harrogate's spa rooms. In addition, changes in medical thinking and social customs in this period resulted in fewer people coming to 'take the waters' in Harrogate. Yet in August 1939, just weeks before the German invasion of Poland, the Pump Room was still attracting a large number of customers. It was arranged with the Corporation that between 7 am and 9.30 am, the roads outside the building were to be closed to allow guests to safely cross the road with their sulphur water glasses to reach tables placed opposite from the Pump Room. Newspaper vendors brought cartloads of newspapers to the Pump Room to sell to customers. These two aspects of the Pump Room's day-to-day operation, which can be seen in a silent film shot by Charles R.H. Pickard's photographic firm of Leeds, show that even in 1939 the Royal Pump Room was still an important visitor attraction and source of revenue for Harrogate Corporation and other parties. It is understood that sometime around the outbreak of the Second World War, the Pump Room was purposefully closed down. Possibly this was due to the government order that forbade the operation of public buildings where large numbers of people could gather e.g. theatres and cinemas. After the end of the war, in spite of the Pump Room's continued appeal to certain visitors to Harrogate, the decision was taken to decommission the building's water pumping equipment. After the Pump Room had been closed to the public the building served as a storehouse and also as a cafe/restaurant for short periods of time. However, by the early 1950s it was decided that the Pump Room would be turned into Harrogate's new museum. =Notable people who visited the Royal Pump Room as a Spa Room and Museum= Charles Dickens visited the building in 1858 and signed the visitors book. His comment seems to suggest he found the habits of people staying in Harrogate to be quite odd and not to his tastes. He wrote \\"(Harrogate is) the queerest place, with the strangest people in it, leading the oddest lives of dancing, newspaper-reading and dining.\\" In 1911 Tsarina Alexandra of Russia who was the wife of Nicholas II of Russia visited the Pump Room. On 2 December 1987, the Duke of Gloucester formally re-opened the Royal Pump Room Museum.A stone tablet recording this event is set in to one of the building's walls. In 2013 Harrogate-born actor Jim Carter gave a talk at the museum in which he discussed his life and acting roles.

Along with the Cathedral of St. Joseph in Wheeling it is the seat of the Catholic Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston. The parish complex is a contributing property in the Downtown Charleston Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places. History =Sacred Heart Parish= The first Catholic priest to visit what is now West Virginia came in 1832. In 1836, the Rev. Alexander L. Hitzelberger of Norfolk, Virginia visited relatives in Charleston and celebrated Mass in the courthouse. Bishop Richard Vincent Whelan of Richmond visited the city in 1842. Pope Pius IX established the diocese of Wheeling on July 19, 1850. Various priests visited the area from time to time. The Rev. Stenger settled in Charleston for a short time in 1862, but the Civil War hindered his ministry. He was able to return and settle in the town again in 1866. There was no church building at the time so Stenger celebrated Mass on the second floor of B. Ward's store on Front Street (now Kanawha Boulevard). Sacred Heart parish was established on August 1, 1866, when Bishop Whelan , who was now Bishop of Wheeling, purchased the Dunbar property in Charleston. A two-story brick building served as a church and school. In 1869, the congregation constructed a frame church measuring for $1,500.00. It sat on the site of the present rectory on Virginia Street. The rectory was located on the site of the old courtyard. The first assistant pastor assigned to Sacred Heart in 1870 was the Rev. Terence I. Duffy. Both priests established and served various missions in the area. In 1885, Father Stenger began collecting funds for a new church and prominent Protestants also provided financial assistance. By 1892, the parish census showed 84 English families and 56 German families. The school had an enrollment of 90 students. He selected H.B. Lowe as architect for the new church, and spent $600 for plans and specifications for the new building. The congregation celebrated its first Mass in the present church Christmas in 1897. Father Stenger died in 1900 and in April 1901 Capuchin friars began their ministry at Sacred Heart. They constructed a new rectory the following year and made additions to the church building in the first decade of the 20th century. The first pipe organ came to the sanctuary in 1905. The marble high altar and stained glass windows from Munich, Germany followed in 1909. The three bells placed in the tower in 1911 are named: St. Richard, St. Joseph and the Blessed Virgin and weigh , and respectively. In 1948, the congregation purchased a Wurlitzer electronic organ for $4,500.00 to replace the old pipe organ. The St. Cecilia's Guild started a weekly bingo to raise the money for a new Kilgen pipe organ, which cost $31,832.48. The interior of the church was extensively renovated from 1950-1951 and the front portion of the current rectory was completed the following year. The parish completed a new convent in 1958 which eventually became the Cenacle Retreat House. The present pews were installed in the church in 1958 for $11,429. Artist John L. Baker painted the sanctuary ceiling with a vibrant, complex linear painting in 1966. =Sacred Heart Co- Cathedral= On October 4, 1974, Pope Paul VI renamed the Diocese of Wheeling as the Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston and Sacred Heart Church became the co- cathedral for the diocese. In 1980, the Capuchins left the parish after ministering at the parish for 79 years. A diocesan priest, the Rev. Edward Sadie became the cathedral rector. Various renovation and building projects occurred in the 1980s. The parish initiated a capital fund drive called Growth In Faith Together to renovate the cathedral inside and out. The project included air-conditioning, cleaning and repairing the stained glass windows and a Schantz 58-rank, three-manual pipe organ (opus 1765). The parish purchased the former Kanawha Valley Hospital building to construct a parking lot and in 1985, dedicated the John XXIII Pastoral Center. New carpeting graced the sanctuary and furniture maker Edward Hillenbrand created a new Bishop's Chair, Ambo and Altar. Bishop Francis B. Schulte dedicated the completed cathedral in 1988. In the 1990s, the parish purchased Riverview Terrace to become a complex for the elderly. The purchase was made possible in part through the estates of Blanche and Maxine Horan. The parish joined with First Presbyterian Church to construct two houses for Habitat for Humanity. In the first decade of the 21st century the parish purchased the parking lot of the Charleston newspaper, remodeled the Cenacle Retreat property for parish office space and apartments for the parish clergy, renaming it the Cordis Center. It also renovated the cathedral and added a new gathering space to the structure. On November 9, 2009, Pope Benedict XVI raised Sacred Heart to the dignity of a Minor Basilica. Catholic schools The first school at Sacred Heart opened in 1866 in the Dunbar Building that served as a combination church and school. For the rest of the 19th century the school was not a stable entity. It ceased operating in 1868 until the Sisters of St. Joseph reopened it in 1870. At the same time, a boarding school named St. Mary's Academy opened and operated until 1895. The school occupied a new building in 1872 but it closed again in 1892. The Franciscan Sisters of Penance and Christian Charity reopened it in 1903 and constructed a new convent in 1904. A new school building opened on September 8, 1920 and the first high school classes began in 1922. The parish purchased and renovated a building to house the high school in 1927. Bishop John Swint laid the cornerstone for a new high school in 1940 and the building opened the following year as Charleston Catholic High School. The grade school was remodeled in 1942 and the Dunbar Building, which had served as grade school, convent, rectory for the Capuchins, school, first high school, parish hall, and parish library was demolished. The school added Kindergarten classes in 1952 and a third floor to the high school building in 1956. The current grade school building opened in 1962 at a cost of $521,140. The school constructed a new playground in 1986, and renovated Seton Hall in 1990 with classrooms on second and third floors and space for the After School Care Program on the first floor. In the 1990s, it initiated a $3.5 million fund drive to fund a new science wing for the high school.

As the name of the cemetery indicates, it is the final resting place of Protestants residing in Istanbul. The cemetery is at Ferik√∂y neighborhood in ≈ûi≈üli district of Istanbul, nearly north of Taksim Square. The land for this cemetery was donated in 1857 by the Ottoman government to the leading Protestant powers of that time, the United Kingdom, Prussia, the United States, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and the Hanseatic League together with the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg. In Istanbul, all members of the Reformed Churches belong to the Protestant Cemetery in Ferik√∂y. Burial sites are being distributed by the Consulate General. Since its opening, a total of roughly 5,000 individuals have been interred at the site. Resembling a museum of funerary art, the cemetery contains examples of different styles of monuments and memorials from the 17th century to the present. The stones proper up along the walls are one of the last tangible links to the old Frankish burial ground in the Grand Champs des Morts, Pera's 'Great Field of the Dead' which was lost in the wake of urban expansion during the 19th century. The consuls general of Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Netherlands, Sweden, Hungary and Switzerland have the duty of managing the cemetery. They exchange the task of management biennially.http://www.levantineheritage.com/note71.htm History Between 1840 and 1910, the area of Istanbul stretching northward from Taksim to ≈ûi≈üli was transformed from open countryside to densely inhabited residential settlement. Early 19th century maps of Istanbul show much of the area in this direction taken up by the non-Muslim burial grounds of the Grand Champs des Morts, with the Frankish section directly in the path of the main route of expansion. The urban development in the Ottoman capital, influenced by Western models, led to the closure of the Grand Champs des Morts - Istanbul's \`City of the Dead', a world-renowned necropolis, which had provided inspiration, as well as an ideal, for the cemetery reformers of Europe. Already by 1842, this burial ground was being whittled down, as a contemporary account by Reverend William Goodell attests. One of the founders of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions to the Armenians at Istanbul, Goodell had lost his nine-year-old son, Constantine Washington, to typhoid fever in 1841 and buried him in the Frankish section of the Grand Champs des Morts. From the memoirs of Reverend William Goodell on February 18, 1842 : On account of the encroachments on the Frank burying ground, I had to remove the body of our beloved boy. The grave had been dug deep, and the coffin was scarcely damp. Every thing was sweet and still. The new grave which we have prepared a few rods distant was also deep and dry; and there we laid the body, to rest in its quiet bed till the resurrection morning. Beloved child, farewell!Prime, Memoirs of Rev. William Goodell, D.D. (Robert Carter and Brothers, 1876) However, little Constantine's tranquility lasted far less than expected, disturbed again by a flurry of construction in the early 1860s. In July 1863, the remains of more than a dozen Americans, including those of Constantine Washington Goodell, were exhumed from the old Frankish burial ground in the Grand Champs des Morts. They were transferred, along with their grave markers, to a new Protestant cemetery in Ferik√∂y - created by order of Sultan Abd√ºlmecid I in the 1850s - for re-interment. The land occupied by the former burial ground was turned into a public park (in a modern Western sense), a project finally completed six years later with the opening of Taksim Garden in 1869. The first body was interred at the new site in November 1858, but the cemetery did not official open until early in 1859. Although the burial ground was created primarily for foreign nationals, a separate section in the southwest corner is reserved for Armenian Protestants.Historian Brian Johnson who works with the American Board in Istanbul is currently [2001-3] engaged in compiling an accurate a list as possible of the names and nationalities of those buried at Ferikoy, from its opening in the 19th century to the present There is one Commonwealth war grave, of an officer of the British Army Intelligence Corps, who died during World War II in 1945. CWGC Casualty record. The Armenian Protestant section The burial plot reserved for Armenian Protestants is separated by a wall from the main cemetery where foreign Protestants are laid to rest, since Armenians were regarded as \\"Ottoman subjects\\".

Howard's sword and sorcery hero Conan the Barbarian. It was first published in trade paperback by Tor Books in November 1991; a regular paperback edition followed from the same publisher in August 1992, and was reprinted in January 1999. Plot After quelling a revolt in Nemedia, Conan loses everything except for his sword while gambling at a tavern. A man follows Conan from the tavern before hiring him to obtain a mysterious and valuable relic. Outfitting himself with the initial payment, Conan travels to the city of Sicas in Aquilonia. Once renowned for its silver mines but now a den of iniquity, more travelers are said to leave Sicas \\"by the river, floating,\\" than through the gates. On the way, he rescues a woman searching for her missing sister, said to have gone into the same place. Sicas turns out to be in the midst of a conflict between numerous contenders for control, most notably the king's corrupt servants, five different gangs, and a religious cult. Conan feels right at home, and plunges into the struggle. Various intrigues and betrayals follow in rapid succession, centering on the object he has been commissioned to recover, which is revealed to be a potent magical artifact. The rising tension in Sicas results in an all out major brawl near the middle of town between local gangs and various power players. In contrast to most of the players, Conan emerges from Sicas ahead of the game, passing by royal forces en route to restore order in the city. When questioned as to how he did it, he responds: \\"That was a town of rogues, my friend, and I am the greatest rogue of all.\\" At the end, with some new comrades, Conan travels into Tarantia as he hears news of a civil war brewing in Aquilonia. Reception Don D'Ammassa, writing of Roberts' Conan novels, noted that \\"[a]lthough Roberts did not recreate Howard's character exactly, making him more intellectual and less inclined to solve every problem by hitting it with a sword, his evocation of the barbaric setting is superior to that of most of the other writers contributing to the series. Conan the Marauder (1987) and Conan the Rogue (1991) are the best of the set.\\" Of this novel he writes \\"[t]he plot is a conscious mashup of The Maltese Falcon and A Fistful of Dollars\\" that \\"works out ... in an amusing and interesting manner..\\"D'Ammassa, Don. \\"Conan the Rogue\\" (review on Critical Mass).

Spielmann, 2003. Geologische Streifz√ºge durch die Eifel. Rhein-Mosel-Verlag, Alf/Mosel, S. 38. (popularly known as the BrubbelRudolf Mehler, 1988Wallenborn, das sch√∂ne Dorf am Brubbel) is a cold water geyser in the village Wallenborn (Eifel district, Germany). It is adjacent to the reactivated Andernach Geyser (aka Namedyer Sprudel) an active cold water geyser in Germany. The Wallender Born coldwater geyser Experts disagree on whether the Wallender Born can be described as eruptive course, but periodic gas outbreaks have been witnessed since time immemorial. Until being drilled, Wallender Born was therefore at least a (periodic) mofette. The high water surge of a typical hot spring was found only after construction work. The fountain is operated geyser-like: The artificial conduit is located below the water surface of a small pond. The water is therefore not thrown like a fountain, but turbulent. The \\"fuel gas\\" of the geyser is carbon dioxide. It contains traces of other gases like hydrogen sulfide which leads to a smell reminiscent of rotten eggs. Interval between eruptions The eruptions of the Wallender Born occur roughly every 35 minutes. An eruption lasts about 5 minutes and is divided into another two clearly distinguishable phases: The first of these two phases will take about 10 seconds, the water from the vent, and possibly underground existing reservoirs, depending on groundwater level and air pressure results in a 2‚Äì4 m high water column (maximum) being ejected. In the second phase, which takes about 5 minutes, the surge varies greatly. The second phase is the quiet phase during which the water slowly sinks back into the vent. The violence of the eruption and the height of the water column varies slightly between outbreaks. Geology Wallender Born is the result of volcanic activity seen in the Eifel region, although the shape of the eruptive source is not a direct consequence of geothermal energy, but of the escape of carbon dioxide. From the magma in the crust volcanic gas rises through cracks and fissures in the earth's surface and dissolves partly in the ground water to carbonic acid. The source is a calcium-sodium-bicarbonate-sorrel. The spring water is very cloudy with sediment.

It is part of the UNESCO Cultural World Heritage Site of the Old City of Bern. The tower was originally part of the city wall of Bern but was absorbed by the house at Waisenhausplatz 15. History The age of the tower is unclear. Near the top of the tower an inscription reads 1230‚Äì1885. Based on this inscription and other evidence, since the 19th century it has been considered by many writers to be the one clear remnant of the Savoy city walls which were built between 1255 and 1260. quoted in Hofer, pg. 168 However, Hofer states that the tower does not match either the inner or outer wall construction or position and is first shown in a drawing of the city from 1623. The late gothic windows are typical of the 16th and early 17th centuries. The distinctive upper story was added in the 17th century by a Bernese officer who had served as a mercenary in Holland. It was at this point that the tower acquired the name Holl√§nderturm. The tower was renovated in 1885.

It is the Anglican parish church of the town, and is in the deanery of Whalley, the archdeaconry of Blackburn, and the diocese of Blackburn. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History The earliest record of a church on the site is in 1122, when it was granted to Pontefract Priory. The tower and east window of the present church date from the 15th century. The rest of the church was rebuilt by Thomas Rickman and Henry Hutchinson in 1828‚Äì29. In 1844 an additional stage and the spire were added to the tower. The church was restored in 1881 by the Lancaster architects Paley and Austin. In 1898 the timber roof and clerestory were added by Frederick Robinson. In 1913, the west gallery was removed. This had contained the original organ made by Samuel Renn in 1834, which was moved elsewhere, possibly to Chester. The new organ, made by J. J. Binns, was sited at the east end of the church. In 2008 a piece of the spire fell off and it was discovered that the spire was crumbling, and in 2010 an appeal was launched to raise money for its repair. Architecture =Exterior= The church is constructed in coursed rubble gritstone with freestone dressings. It has a slate roof and clay ridge tiles. Its plan consists of a six-bay nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles, a southwest vestry, a chancel with a south chapel, a two-storey north vestry, and a west tower. The tower is in Perpendicular style, with four stages, angle buttresses, and a southeast stair turret. In the bottom stage of the tower is a west doorway, above which is a three-light window. In the second stage are narrow square-headed windows, and the third stage contains two-light windows. In the top stage is a round clock face in a square frame on each side. On the corners of the towers are octagonal turrets that rise above the parapet, which is embattled. The spire is supported by flying buttresses, and contains lucarnes. The clerestory contains two-light square-headed windows, it has an embattled parapet, and octagonal angle turrets at the east end. The aisles have plain parapets, and buttresses rising to gables. The west windows have two lights, the windows along the sides are tall and also have two lights, and all contain Decorated- style tracery. On the south side in the fifth bay is a doorway; the corresponding bay on the north side has a door leading into the vestry. The east wall of the chancel has angle buttresses and a five light window with Perpendicular tracery. In the south chapel is a blocked doorway and a two- light square-headed east window. The north vestry has a blocked north doorway, and a two-light east window with a triangular window above it. =Interior= Inside the church are north and south galleries carried on cast iron posts. The arcades between the nave and the aisles are supported by tall octagonal piers. In the chancel is an ogee-headed piscina dating from the 14th or 15th century. The octagonal font is plain, and is said to be from the 17th century; it stands on a 20th-century base. The polygonal pulpit was moved here in 1979 from St John's Church, Darwen. The monuments include damaged effigies dating from the 15th century in the south chapel. Also in the chapel is a brass plate to the memory of John Webster, an astrologist and local headmaster, who died in 1682. On the north chancel wall is a hatchment, and wall tablets to the Aspinall family with dates in the 18th and 19th centuries. The south chancel contains a wall tablet to Thomas Wilson, who died in 1813, by Richard Westmacott. In the north aisle is an alabaster memorial to those who died in the First World War. There is heraldic stained glass in the east window, with some fragments of medieval glass. The four-manual organ was rebuilt in 1961 by Nicholson. It has been repaired twice by Sixsmith; in 1970 following damage by water; and in 1982, when it was rebuilt after fire damage. It was rebuilt again in 2007 by Principal Pipe Organs. There is a ring of eight bells, all of which were cast in 1928 by Gillett & Johnston.

It tells the story of Alike (Adepero Oduye), a 17-year-old African American embracing her identity as a lesbian. It premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival and was awarded the Excellence in Cinematography Award. Plot Alike is a 17-year-old African-American girl who hangs out at clubs with her openly lesbian friend Laura. Alike slowly and firmly comes to terms with her own identity as a butch lesbian, comfortable in baggy clothes and male underwear. Her mother Audrey approves of neither her clothes nor her friendship with Laura. Harboring growing suspicions about Alike's sexuality, Audrey forces her to wear feminine clothing and tries to stem any influence from Laura by pushing Alike to instead make friends with Bina, a young girl from her church. Alike has a better relationship with her father Arthur, who is a police detective. Alike begins to develop feelings for Bina, and starts spending more time with her than with Laura, much to Laura's annoyance. Arthur comes back late a few times from work, which angers Audrey and the two of them fight often. Arthur does not think much about the changes in Alike's life. Saying she is going through a phase, he is supportive of her, although he cautions her on steering clear of the area where there is a lesbian bar, saying it's not safe. One night after going to see an alternative rock band, Alike and Bina are alone in Bina's room when Bina begins caressing and kissing Alike. Alike is at first hesitant, having had no prior experience with physical intimacy. However, she eventually responds and the two spend the night together. In the morning, Alike talks to Bina about where they want their relationship to go, but Bina says there is no relationship, as she is not \\"really gay-gay\\" and only regarded their physical encounter as playful indulgence. Her only further interest in Alike seems to be her concern that Alike not tell anyone else about the two of them. Hurt and upset, Alike leaves and returns home and cries for hours. During that time, Audrey and Arthur have an explosive fight about Alike. Despite her sister Sharonda's protests, Alike decides to intervene in the fight and she comes out to her parents. Disgusted, Audrey viciously attacks Alike while Arthur tries to restrain her. Alike flees to Laura's house where the two friends reconcile. Audrey then tries to forget that anything happened, which annoys the rest of her family. Arthur comes to meet with Alike, apologizes for Audrey's actions and requests that Alike come back home, offering half-hearted assurance that if she does, \\"things will be different\\". Alike says that she will not return home, but instead plans to move to California to begin college early. She assures her father that, \\"I'm not running; I'm choosing.\\" Before leaving, Alike makes an attempt to reconcile with her mother as well. However, her mother refuses to accept her and offers only that she will be praying for Alike. Arthur, Sharonda and Laura see Alike off on her journey west and the film ends with Alike reading a poem she wrote; its theme echoes her words to her father that she is not running, but choosing.

Spike Lee is one of the executive producers. Filming took place in and around New York City, predominantly in the Fort Greene neighborhood in Brooklyn. Release and reception Pariah premiered at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival and was awarded the Excellence in Cinematography Award. The film was shown at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2011. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 95% based on 114 reviews, with an average rating of 7.87/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"Pulsing with authenticity and led by a stirring lead performance from Adepero Oduye, Pariah is a powerful coming out/coming-of-age film that signals the arrival of a fresh new talent in writer/director Dee Rees.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 79 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". In his New York Times article, film critic A.O. Scott wrote that to watch Adepero Oduye play Alike \\"is to experience the thrill of discovery.\\" Scott continued by saying that \\"Pariah has a point to make, and a point of view to argue, but it also, above all, wants to illuminate an individual universe of meaning and emotion.\\" AutoStraddle placed the movie 6th on its list of the top 102 lesbian movies of all time.

The Natural History Society was a society that aimed to promote the native flora and fauna of South Australia. Together, the Conquests and the NHSSA raised funds to acquire a section of Portee Station for the purpose of establishing a sanctuary for the Southern Hairy Nosed Wombat. The appeal was the first environmental appeal in the state and raised sufficient funds to purchase two parcels of land totalling 2020 hectares and named Moorunde Wildlife Reserve by the Society after the name used by Edward Eyre for a local magistrate outpost. Disagreements over the Conquests' plan to run safari tours and the Society preference for protecting wombat habitat as a priority saw the Conquests remove their support for the project. The society obtained contiguous sections of Portee, known as the 12 mile plain, in 2008 increasing the size of the property to 6950 hectares.

The students of this initial academic year received free uniforms for the re-opening In December 2014, the Norfolk based Inspiration Trust (IT) formally took over the running of the academy and appointed Kevin Blakey as Principal. The main reasons (see 2014 takeover section below) behind this was the failure of the AET to move the academy out of special measures and that the IT were better placed geographically with its Norfolk base to continuously improve the academy, compared to the relative isolation under AET and its other academies. On 16 October 1987, a great storm hit the area. \\"A classroom block at Kirkley High School was completely demolished in the destruction\\". The school will be refurbished with funding from the government which was secured by the AET before it was taken over by Inspiration Trust Ofsted According to the Ofsted inspection in March 2015 (3 months after the IT had acquired the academy) the school leadership was rated as \\"good\\" although other criteria \\"require improvement\\". Overall the academy has improved from being rated as \\"Inadequate\\" to \\"Requires Improvement\\".http://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/provider/files/2464391/urn/137134.pdf This was upgraded to \\"Good\\" in October 2016. As \\"Good\\" rated schools are typically inspected every 4 years, the next inspection is due late 2020, however Ofsted reserve the right to visit any educational establishment without any notice at any time for any reason/concern. In October 2019, the academy received criticism from Ofsted for the \\"high number of pupils being taken off academy's roll\\" in Year 11. A suggested reason for this is to \\"remove low-performing or troublesome students. While it is not unlawful, Ofsted considers the practice unacceptable.\\" The Ofsted report mentions \\"‚ÄòLeaders have good intentions, but they were not analysing their data about inclusion closely enough.‚Äô\\". This means that common reasons for the students leaving was not analysed and thus solutions to prevent pupils leaving the academy could not be formulated to prevent pupils from leaving the academy.https://files.api.ofsted.gov.uk/v1/file/50124161 2014 Inspiration Trust takeover After 3 years under the management of the AET, the academy was placed in \\"special measures\\" by Ofsted. In July 2014 it was announced that the academy faced a takeover from the Norfolk-based Inspiration Trust, due to the academy making insufficient progress towards moving out of special measures. A spokesman for the Department for Education (DfE) said: \\"We have consistently demonstrated that where we find failure we will not hesitate to take action ‚Äì regardless of the type of school. We are now working closely with AET and the school to ensure pupils‚Äô education is not disrupted.\\" A monitoring inspection in May 2014 pointed to a \\"steady improvement\\" in students‚Äô attainment and progress, saying East Point was making \\"reasonable progress towards the removal of special measures\\".https://files.api.ofsted.gov.uk/v1/file/2394973 Dame Rachel de Souza, the Chief Executive of Inspiration Trust was approached by the DfE about adding the academy to its growing portfolio. The DfE believed that her trust was in a better geographic and cohesive position compared to the AET, with the aim to bring the academy out of special measures quickly. (In July 2014, the next nearest AET sponsored academy to East Point Academy was in Felixstowe, approximately 40‚Äì50 miles away) \\"There‚Äôs a geographic logic to the change. We are [East Point Academy is] 10 miles from Great Yarmouth, where we have the primary academy. I think that‚Äôs what can make the difference.\\" In September 2014 the Principal (Neil Powell) and other senior members of staff threatened to quit the Academy if the proposed takeover did materialise. This was mainly due to the disruption it would cause to the ongoing progress towards moving the academy out of special measures. In December 2014 the Vice Principal of Inspiration Trust sponsored Thetford Academy, Kevin Blakey, replaced Neil Powell as Principal of East Point Academy, when Inspiration Trust completed the takeover. Mr. Powell cited that he will be \\"staying with the AET\\" and was installed Principal of the AET sponsored Unity City Academy in Middlesbrough in January 2015. Following the Jan 2016 DfE letter complaining about 'unacceptably low standards' and failing to move the academy out of Special Measures, Mr Powell resigned and left UCA in April 2016, returning to East Anglia in September 2016 as headteacher of North Walsham High School, which is administered by the local council and not the AET..

In addition, for the criteria \\"Effectiveness of leadership and management\\", was rated as \\"Outstanding\\". Sporting connections Logo of Lowestoft Ladies Hockey Club The academy has many connections with sport. Lowestoft Ladies Hockey Club and Lowestoft Railway Hockey Club both base themselves at the academy. In 2000, the academy (as KHS) became a Sports Specialist school culminating with association football success on 2 May 2008, the school lifted the U16 Royal Air Force Girls‚Äô Cup. They overcame Bridgnorth Endowed School 3-2 at the City of Manchester Stadium. The girls football success continued in May 2009, winning the U14 Suffolk County Cup, beating Stowmarket High School 2-1. Both Kirkley goals were scored by Hannah Walsh in the final played at Gainsborough Sports Centre in Ipswich. Gene Simmons' Rock School In Autumn 2005, the second series of Channel 4's Gene Simmons' Rock School was filmed at the Academy (when it was Kirkley Community High School). Auditions were held, and after much deliberation, 11 students were picked and were subsequently taught the basics of rock music by KISS bassist Gene Simmons. Simmons' eventually selected five of the students to perform as a rock group. The show culminated with the group opening for Judas Priest and Anthrax in front of 2,300 fans in LA.

Psychiatrists have been involved in human rights abuses in states across the world when the definitions of mental disease were expanded to include political disobedience. As scholars have long argued, governmental and medical institutions code menaces to authority as mental diseases during political disturbances. Nowadays, in many countries, political prisoners are sometimes confined and abused in mental institutions. Psychiatric confinement of sane people is uniformly considered a particularly pernicious form of repression. In the period from the 1960s up to 1986, abuse of psychiatry for political purposes was reported to be occasional in Eastern European countries such as Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia, and systematic in the Soviet Union.  Background  Robert van Voren of the Global Initiative on Psychiatry says the emergence of individual cases of political abuse of psychiatry in Russia is directly related to the deterioration of the human rights situation and to the fact that on-the-spot authorities feel more carefree than they did before, and deal with undesirable elements at their own discretion. The aura of inviolability is returned to the Russian rulers, the rule of law becomes subject to political machinations. Everything points to the fact that Russia still has the structure to exercise political abuse of psychiatry. Both political and economic nomenklatura is quite powerful and would not stop short at using illegal means especially now, when the political nomenklatura has absorbed economic power from Russian oligarchs, and the country is, in fact, ruled by the circle of people who came directly from the KGB whose capacities to establish control are limitless. This does not bode well for the future. According to Eduard Kuznetsov, \\"More than 50 percent of the key state positions are occupied by former KGB officials. The KGB officials have a specific mentality. They can't change. There is a danger that it will really be a police state. Not so straightforward as it was under Brezhnev, because there is inertia, because they have to balance between the [opinion of the] free world and a controlled society.\\" The same occasionally happens in many countries monitored by the Global Initiative on Psychiatry. Psychiatry is regarded as a handy tool to solve disputes, and one can easily buy a diagnosis from a psychiatrist. In most of the countries, forensic psychiatry has changed only slightly, the strong resistance to introducing the modern practices of forensic psychiatry is due to not disparities in schools or views but the fact that the reform of the system would mean the end of corruption. Criminals pay off their imprisonment of many years by having themselves declared insane. Wealthy husbands declare about the mental illnesses in their wives to get rid of them and yet keep control over their children. Children declare their parents and grandparents legally incapable to sell their apartments. Even medical institutions recognize their patients as insane to take their property. It is just a press for printing money. Today the Russian opposition cannot expect the type of help the West gave in Soviet times. Supporting Soviet dissidents was part of anti-Soviet policy but now pragmatism and precise calculation rules. According to psychiatrist Sofia Dorinskaya, the situation always develops in the same way: either in the evening or at night, or in the early morning, when a person sleeps, the police break the door down in his apartment or room, handcuff and escort him directly or through a police office to a mental hospital, where the door is closed behind the person. When the door is closed and you sit face to face with a psychiatrist, then all written by the psychiatrist will be a proof of your madness for a judge in court. Even if you just sit on a chair, speak nothing or any anything reasonable, the psychiatrist can write that you threw yourself against walls and that you tried to scratch his eyes out and so on and so forth. Discrediting the citizens by instituting farfetched proceedings to obtain a ground for examination is a favorite tactic of officials whose interests are hurt by the active members of public. The police deliver \\"the ill\\" to a psychiatric facility, and the doctor can be sure that his facility will not be reduced, and, in general, the more \\"patients\\", the more funding. Even if the criminal case is closed due to its complete failure, it does not regard the dispensary, the person is all the same \\"ill\\". According to Doctor of Legal Sciences Vladimir Ovchinsky, regional differences in forensic psychiatric expert reports are striking. For example, in some regions of Russia, 8 or 9 percent of all examinees are pronounced sane; in other regions up to 75 percent of all examinees are pronounced sane. In some regions less than 2 percent of examinees are declared schizophrenics; in other regions up to 80 percent of examinees are declared schizophrenics. According to Vitaly Portnikov, 86 percent of Russians support the policy of their president, who renewed punitive psychiatry, and approve of declaring the healthy people the mentally ill.  Mass trials  From 1994, the nationalization of expert activity started, and people witnessed the same technologies as those practiced on political dissidents. The same gimmicks were applied to religious dissenters to a not lesser extent. In the Serbsky Center, the special group for \\"study of the negative influence of religious groups\\" under the leadership of professor Fyodor Kondratyev was created. Kondratyev's group started supervising numerous trials initiated all over the country. It came to legal actions practically for sorcery. The Nezavisimiy Psikhiatricheskiy Zhurnal documented the history of numerous religious trials, demonstrated the total groundlessness of the charges of \\"gross harm on mental health\\", and evolved their political and ideological background. The Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia repeatedly caught Fyodor Kondratyev, the author of pseudoscientific theory of sectomania, in his falsifications. His special department \\"for studying destructive cults,\\" which is located in the Serbsky Center, closely collaborated with Alexander Dvorkin. Known for his intolerance and radicalism, Dvorkin has nothing in common with science and ranks even followers of Nikolai Rerikh and the religious communities of Yakov Krotov and Grigori Kochetkov among \\"totalitarian sects.\\" In Yuri Savenko's words, \\"when a psychiatrist-academician (Dmitrieva, Sidorov) or an expert-psychologist of the Institute of Psychology of the Russian Academy of Sciences rely on the works by Dvorkin and Hassan, which do not belong to science, it is a symptom of degradation.\\" In 2014, the experts of the Serbsky Center received the medical documents about the mental health condition of Alexander Dvorkin from a psychoneurological dispensary, studied them and concluded that he needed to be constantly supervised by a psychiatrist and take psychotropic drugs. The denial by the Serbsky Center of the abuse of psychiatry for political purposes in 1960‚Äì1980s and the open rehabilitation of the main director of this infamous campaign academician Georgi Morozov are a direct evidence of the restoration of police psychiatry. There have been examples of the serious misuse of psychiatry by local authorities reminiscent of the Soviet abuses. A number of human rights organizations including the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia criticized the use of psychiatry in \\"deprogramming\\" members of \\"totalitarian sects.\\"; In such cases, authorities apply spiritual and pseudo-psychological techniques to \\"treat\\" individuals who are members of new religious groups. Six Scientologists were arbitrarily detained for psychiatric examination. In January 2000 in St. Petersburg, chief psychiatrist Larisa Rubina charged leader of Sentuar (the local offshoot of the Church of Scientology) Vladimir Tretyak with inflicting psychological damage on his coreligionists. On June 17, six members of Sentuar ‚Äì Lyudmila Urzhumtseva, Svetlana Pastuchenkova, Svetlana Kruglova, Irina Shamarina, Igor Zakrayev, and Mikhail Dvorkin ‚Äì were forcibly hospitalized and subjected to 3 weeks of criminal investigation at the behest of Boris Larionov, procurator of the Vyborgsky district of St. Petersburg. In 2005, Igor Kanterov, a professor of the Moscow State University, wrote that psychiatrists and psychologists were actually being involved in a very unattractive occupation, stigmatizing \\"alien\\" religions and their followers, who were about 1 million first-class citizens of the Russian Federation, and putting them \\"on the basis of a list of them\\" in the category of \\"psychic terrorists.\\" While reviewing Sidorov's article \\"Psychic terrorism is nonlethal weapon of mass destruction\\" published by the Rossiyskiy Psikhiatricheskiy Zhurnal in its issue 3 of 2005, Kanterov notes that, according to it, religious behavior is regarded as inherently deviant from the \\"norm\\", that similar type of behavior is always dependent and imposed by recruiting and manipulative influence and that, thus, the possibility to be initiated into religious organizations due to free choice of religious belief guaranteed by the Constitution of the Russian Federation is outright rejected. In his 2010 article, Kanterov writes about the works by P.I. Sidorov and V.E. Pashkovskiy and points out that inspired by the desire to expose the malicious actions of \\"totalitarian cults,\\" P.I. Sidorov and V.E. Pashkovskiy at the same time never resort to Russian laws regulating activity of religious associations, and it can hardly be considered accidental, since all the original sets of the authors are in flagrant contravention of current legislation. The Federal Law of the Russian Federation \\"On Freedom of Conscience and on Religious Associations\\" contains the following types of associations of believers: religious groups, religious organizations, local and centralized religious associations, and its legislator mentions about no \\"sects,\\" \\"cults,\\" especially with the frightening adjectives \\"destructive\\" or \\"totalitarian.\\" However, in Kanterov's words, peer-reviewed publications use the term \\"totalitarian sects\\" as a key concept that naturally generates psychiatric disorders and produces horror stories about \\"psychic terrorism,\\" \\"non-lethal weapon of mass destruction,\\" \\"usurpation of belongings and savings of followers,\\" \\"recruitment,\\" etc. P.I. Sidorov presents a list of \\"totalitarian cults\\" with the names of over twenty religious organizations, and many of them have status of registered centralized organizations that successfully passed registration and re-registration provided for by the Law \\"On Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations\\" after the Expert Council for Religious Examination under the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation made for each of these organizations expert reports, in which the detailed assessment of the religious doctrine, rituals, attitude of the religious organizations to society, family, and individual were given, but no violations were found. In 2006, Yuri Savenko stated that a first large relapse of the use of psychiatry for political purposes in post-Soviet Russia during recent decade was struggle against \\"totalitarian sects.\\" According to Yuri Savenko, the reason for the use of psychiatry against religious minorities, which began from 1995, was Y.I. Polishchuk's report containing conclusion about \\"gross harm on mental health\\" inflicted by various religious organizations. This report was distributed to all public prosecutors' offices of the country and to the presidents of the educational institutions despite the fact that its scientific inadequacy was emphasized by not only the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia (the IPA), but also the Russian Society of Psychiatrists since all imputed cases of illness, suicide, family breakdown, etc. proved to be much more frequent in the general population than in the persecuted religious organizations. As the result of a series of court trials, it is only the vocabulary of the accusations that changed and became less clumsy; \\"destructive cults\\" started to be used instead of \\"totalitarian sects\\"; \\"unlawful use of hypnosis\\", then \\"inconspicuous use of suggestion\\", and, finally, \\"action at a subconscious level\\" through lectures and printed production with even anti-drug abuse contents started to be used instead of \\"gross harm on mental health\\". In 1999, the IPA expressed its concern about the facts of the use of psychiatry against religious minorities in the IPA Open Letter to the General Assembly of XI Congress of the WPA. When stressing all the responsibility taken by the authors of the letter for the action involved in their statement, they noted in it that they considered it necessary to draw the WPA General Assembly's attention to the recurrent use of psychiatry for non-medical purposes, which was recommenced in Russia from 1994‚Äì1995, was subsequently going on a large-scale without slackening and was aimed at suppressing not political dissenters but already religious dissenters. This letter was concluded with the proposal, which was addressed to the WPA, to adopt the text of statement containing words of the WPA's concern about initiating numerous lawsuits against various religious organizations in Russia for allegedly \\"inflicting by them gross harm on mental health and for unhealthy changes of personality\\" and to express in the statement the WPA's solidarity with the position of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia and the Russian Society of Psychiatrists as to inadmissibility of involving psychiatrists in issues straining their professional competence. In 2003, a \\"wrongful confinement\\" lawsuit, in which Yuri Savenko took part, was filed in the European Court of Human Rights. When writing about this case, Savenko charged the Serbsky Institute with \\"having pernicious effect on Russian medicine\\" and warned that the psychiatric leadership \\"is now completely under the shadow of the state.\\" Savenko's organization cooperated with a number of other NGOs to compose a highly critical report about rising rates of mental disease and the deteriorating system of mental health care. In the report, authors blamed \\"chronic underfunding of psychiatric care, corruption, and poverty\\" and pointed an accusing finger at the psychiatric leadership. Legal proceedings took place against the organization \\"F.A.K.E.L.-P.O.R.T.O.S.\\", a youth commune of the similar type as that of Anton Makarenko. The organization was engaged in self- improvement of its members and re-education of street children and created successful farms under Kharkov and Moscow. In 2000, the commune was smashed up by Luberetskiy RUBOP, with gross violations of law, the members of the organization was wrongly accused of creating \\"an illegal paramilitary group.\\" In particular, Yuriy Davydov was sentenced to imprisonment and compulsory treatment with a diagnosis of \\"schizophrenia, delusional ideas of perestroika and reformation of society\\" made by the Serbsky Center. Evgeni Privalov was declared insane with the diagnosis of \\"schizophrenia\\". The defence insisted that Davydov and Privalov had to be acquitted \\"as mentally healthy people\\". Yulia Privedyonnaya was eventually recognized as mentally healthy by forensic psychiatric expert examination. The case of Privedyonnaya lasted for a long time. In human rights activists' opinion, her inpatient forensic psychiatric expert examination was a means to intimidate her and psych her out. They saw Privedyonnaya's plight as yet another worrying sign that Russia's authorities were ready to renew Soviet-style psychiatric treatment of dissenters.  Individual cases  = Ivan Ivannikov = In December 2003, Ivan Ivannikov, who lectured at the Saint Petersburg State University of Economics and Finance for 38 years, was committed to the city psychiatric hospital after a long dispute with a contractor over repairs to his apartment. The recommendation for commitment was signed by an influential state psychiatrist, who had not met Ivannikov before it was decided that his multiple legal complaints against the contractor were an \\"obsession\\" with \\"revenge.\\" He was discharged after 60 days.; = Rafael Usmanov = Rafael Usmanov was trying to struggle for the position of the governor of the Magadan Oblast. He lost his struggle. Tsvetkov who won the election brought an action against Usmanov, accusing him of libel. The case lasted for a long time. Law enforcement agencies, aware of the inefficacy of their collected body of evidence (the human rights activist used the documented facts in his agitational campaign), resorted to his sending to a mental hospital. Usmanov passed psychiatric examination five times. All the five examinations declared him to be sane and capable. Therefore, he saw nothing special in his being called to appear in a psychoneurological dispensary. But this time, to his surprise, he was sent to a psychiatric unit from the head doctor's office and hospitalized. The psychiatric examination declared him to be insane. The documents told a murky story that Usmanov found somewhere a gas pistol, remade into a fire one, shot at the head of the unit of the Magadan psychiatric hospital and injured him in the leg. However, the body of evidence for the accusation was based on the hospital personnel's testimonies alone. The indictment lacked any references to statements of dactyloscopic and other examinations. According to the 2004 report by the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights, he shot at the head doctor with the hope that a criminal action will be brought against him and that he will be tried for the assassination attempt on the life of the head doctor; it was the last straw he tried to grasp at to escape from the hands of psychiatrists. The plan failed. Usmanov spent in the hospital nine years, from 2003 to 2012. = Igor Molyakov = In 2004, Igor Molyakov was imprisoned on libel charges for six months. While imprisoned, he was ordered committed for hospitalization to a psychiatric hospital after government lawyers persuaded a judge that Molyakov expressed in his writings about corruption among local authorities a view so \\"somber\\" that it might be regarded as a \\"mental disorder.\\" = Albert Imendayev = In the fall of 2005, Albert Imendayev was committed to a psychiatric hospital when he collected the signatures to run for the legislature in Cheboksary. Nine days later he was discharged and was out of the race, because by that time the election filing deadline had passed. Imendayev's act of insanity was filing a number of legal complaints against local officials, judges, prosecutors, and police, alleging violation of court procedures, corruption, and cronyism‚Äîcharges that are typical of modern Russia. The prosecutor, who was a frequent target of Imendayev's criticisms, qualified his behavior as \\"paranoia.\\" = Roman Lukin = In 2005, Roman Lukin, a businessman of Cheboksary, held up a sign on a public square calling three judges \\"creeps\\" and after that was committed for \\"unexplainable behavior\\". He felt he had not received justice from the courts after seeking a compensation for a bad debt that ruined him. Lukin spent two weeks in the local psychiatric hospital, which recommended that he be subjected to further evaluation for possible \\"paranoid personality disorder\\" at a specialized hospital in Moscow. The doctors of the Independent Psychiatric Association who examined Lukin found him mentally healthy. = Nikolai Skachkov = In 2005, Nikolai Skachkov, who protested police brutality and official corruption in the Omsk region of Siberia, spent six months in a closed psychiatric facility, with a diagnosis of paranoia. The association, which carried out a separate examination earlier this year, found him healthy. = Marina Trutko = In March 2006, a former nuclear scientist and vocal public defender Marina Trutko was subjected to daily injections for six weeks at Psychiatric Hospital No. 14 in Dubna, Russia, to treat her for a \\"paranoid personality disorder.\\" = Svyatoslav Barykin = In 2006, a forester of the Muromtsevsky District Svyatoslav Barykin wrote to the District Department of the Interior, the prosecutor and the district head to inform them about constantly plundering timberland in the forest where he worked and lived. In the early morning, two officers of the District Department of the Interior and a nurse knocked on the door of Barykin's house. The group brought the decision to forcibly hospitalize the forester signed by Stepanov, a psychiatrist of the region hospital. He recognized paranoia, schizophrenia and severe syndrome of litigiousness in Barykin. Psychiatrists Antoshkin, Minaeva, Kovalchuk confirmed the diagnosis made by their colleague Stepanov and sent the \\"patient\\" to a violent patients ward. However, a fact confusing to the hospital was soon found out: a week before his forced hospitalization, the forester passed the voluntary examination in the hospital to receive a permit of the right to have a hunting weapon. And the hospital gave him a reference that he is absolutely mentally healthy. As a result, the district court of Omsk, after considering the reference on the forester's sanity, decided to let him leave the mental hospital where he spent ten days. = Dmitri Shchyokotov = Dmitri Shchyokotov, who defended the rights of ordinary inhabitants of the Muromtsevsky District in their conflicts with headmen and local authorities, was accused of slander on the head of local judicial authority and committed in a psychiatric hospital. After he spent two days in its violent unit without having food, water, and medicines, he was recognized as sane by the commission of doctors of the Omsk psychiatric hospital and discharged. However, he lost his eyesight because he could not use his eye drops for these two days in the psychiatric hospital. = Vladimir Bukovsky = In 2007, an official at the Serbsky Center declared that Vladimir Bukovsky, who was then going to run for the President of the Russian Federation, was undoubtedly \\"psychopathic\\". In 2012, Mikhail Vinogradov, one of the leading staff members of the Serbsky Center, said publicly that Bukovsky was \\"a completely crazy character.\\" = Artyom Basyrov = In 2007, an activist of the coalition \\"The Other Russia\\" Artyom Basyrov was involuntarily placed in a psychiatric hospital on the eve of planned \\"demonstration of dissent\\", one of the organizers of which was A. Basyrov. A. Basyrov suffered from slight mental disorder, but there was no real reason for his hospitalization: Artyom was in need of outpatient therapy, not involuntary inpatient treatment. In the reasoned opinion of the medical commission sent to the court, his mental disorders were grossly exaggerated. = Andrei Novikov = There were also no reasons for the involuntary inpatient treatment of Andrei Novikov, a journalist imprisoned on charges of extremism and sent to involuntary psychiatric treatment, after he publicly criticized Vladimir Putin's policy in Chechnya.; Impartial legal proceedings would not have found formal components of a crime in the charges brought against Novikov, but his old psychiatric diagnosis along with the expansive interpretation of the concept of \\"danger\\" as the reason for his involuntary hospitalization allowed to solve his case in the way most convenient for authorities. = Larisa Arap = In July 2007, the activist Larisa Arap was forcibly confined at a psychiatric clinic in Apatity soon after publishing her article about mistreatment of patients in the same hospital where she was committed.; ; ; ; ; = Marina Kalashnikova = Journalist Marina Kalashnikova was also detained in a mental hospital for 35 days and claims it was done in an attempt to dissuade her from criticising the authorities. = Alexey Manannikov = On 23 December 2010, Alexey Manannikov, one of organizers of oppositional rallies in Novosibirsk, was sent for psychiatric examination to a mental hospital because of his insulting the judge of the Central Regional Court of Novosibirsk Mariya Shishkina by writing in his blog.; = Nadezhda Nizovkina = In 2012, Nadezhda Nizovkina and Vera Lavreshina were detained during their protest action at the Red Square. After Nizovkina refused to write an application that she is sorry for what she had been doing at the Red Square, she was convicted to \\"involuntary hospitalization in psychiatric hospital for six months.\\" Nizovkina was hospitalized in Gannushkina Psychiatric Hospital, and her hospitalization was ruled legal by Moscow's Preobrazhensky District Court. On the doctors' request, her mother assumed responsibility for her by signing documents and was permitted to take her from the hospital. = Pussy Riot = In August 2012, non-medical use of psychiatry surfaced in the case of \\"Pussy Riot\\". The defendants passed through forensic psychiatric examination in the Kashchenko psychiatric hospital outside Moscow, a facility that in Soviet era was heavily involved in political abuse of psychiatry. The psychiatric and psychological report presented by the prosecution alleged that the three women suffered from \\"personality disorders\\" and thereby must be isolated from society. However, the defense could not question the experts as they did not come to the court. The report used the language very similar to the qualifications used in Soviet era when diagnosing dissenters. On 25 August 2012, this examination entailed an open letter by Russian psychologist Aleksandr Asmolov who wrote, \\"In the eyes of the civilized world, our science, psychology in the first place, is turned into an ideological weapon of punishment and repression. First of all, it is a matter of the non-professional use of psychological and psycholinguistic examination in court practice. The ghost of the insulin Gulag, of punitive science reappears in the country.\\" = Mikhail Kosenko = On 8 October 2013, a verdict was announced in the case of Mikhail Kosenko. He took part in the protest march at Moscow's Bolotnaya Square on 6 May 2012. Along with other witnesses, Alexander Podrabinek, a former Soviet dissident and currently Radio France Internationale commentator, testified that Kosenko had stood next to him and had not scuffled with police. After just one brief conversation with Kosenko, specialists from the Serbsky Center made a highly questionable diagnosis and the conclusion that Kosenko \\"presented a danger to himself and others\\" and \\"required compulsory treatment.\\" This conclusion ignored his prior diagnosis and the fact that he was not once cited for aggressive or suicidal behavior within 16 months of his pretrial detention in Butyrka prison. A special announcement on the case was issued by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia: \\"On the basis of a conversation that lasted less than one hour, the specialists made the far more serious diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia instead of the diagnosis of sluggish neurosis-like schizophrenia that Kosenko was treated for over the course of 12 years.\\" The court sent Kosenko for open-ended treatment to a psychiatric hospital. On 19 December 2013, the Commission on Professional Ethics Issues at the Board of the Russian Society of Psychiatrists delivered to the president of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia Yuri Savenko, who raised ethical issues concerning Kosenko in publications, a resolution as follows: Savenko responded that the strikingly unethical nature of the resolution by the Ethical Commission (of 12 December 2013) showed in the ascription to the IPA open letter to the WPA, hosted on the website, of phrases that were never used there. He adds we see a rather awkward performance of a social role using the old scenario of accusatory campaigns of Soviet times to have the possibility to refer to \\"the opinion of the professional public\\" for use abroad. = Other cases = People \\"complaining to various authorities\\" are often sent to a psychiatric hospital without indications for the involuntary hospitalization when the only purpose for it is to stop their \\"paranoic- litigious activity\\". When talking about punitive psychiatry, Lyubov Vinogradova of the IPA says, it is now used mostly not in political cases but in those related to family disputes or disputes over apartments.  Extrajudicial involuntary hospitalizations  There are cases when the motive for the unfounded psychiatric hospitalization was the intention of the administration of an orphanage to punish its inmates for their runaways and disobedience. During many involuntary hospitalizations in recent years, the staff of psychiatric hospitals did not follow the mandatory judicial procedure provided by the Law. In 2009, several orphans from the city of Kimovsk in Tula Oblast ran away from their orphanage to a local priest. They told that they were sent to a psychiatric hospital through the explanation of their teachers \\"for disobedience and the edification of others.\\" The expert report from the Serbsky Center for Forensic Psychiatry showed that they were \\"mentally healthy.\\" In 2010, 20 out of 72 orphans from an orphanage in Komsomolsk-on- Amur were placed in a psychiatric hospital and exposed to neuroleptic medication. The city prosecutor found that all the children were placed in the hospital to be treated for \\"emotional disorders\\" without having been examined by a commission of psychiatrists or provided for by a court judgment. The children told they had been warned that they would send to a madhouse because of their bad behavior. In the rurban of Sofino in Moscow Oblast from 2008 to 2011, psychiatric hospitalizations and treatments have been imposed on 23 of 46 inmates who reside in a local orphanage. In March 2011, the Saint Petersburg Commissioner for Child Rights Svetlana Agapitova reported on the hospitalization of four orphans from the orphanage No. 19 as a punishment for their disobedience. The medical records of the children did not contain notes of these hospitalizations. It is significant that none of the cases has reached a trial and entailed real convictions. All taken measures were limited to the prosecutor's investigation. According to some estimates, a psychiatric diagnosis is given to half of all children who live in state institutions. Infant orphans who came of age and received a diagnosis in a psychiatric hospital are sent to psychoneurological internats without asking their consent. There a new problem arises: quite legally capable people cannot get out of there, work, start their family and live a normal life.  Reaction  The charge that psychiatry is again being abused is not universally accepted within the profession in Russia. In 2006, Vladimir Rotstein, who is the president of Public Initiative on Psychiatry, an advocacy group, stated that the problem of psychiatric persecution or forced treatment existed more than 20 years ago, but it was solved and since then he has not heard of any case of forced psychiatric treatment or examination. However, the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia states that the number of activists being wrongfully committed to psychiatric institutions totals dozens of cases in recent years.; According to its president Yuri Savenko, law enforcement practice, of course, is very far from the letter of the law, forensic psychiatric expert examination has deteriorated because of the lack of competition, and courts implicitly fulfill wishes of the vertical of executive authority affected by corruption. The Russian legislation did not implement Principle 18 of the Principles for the Protection of Persons with Mental Illness and the Improvement of Mental Health Care, approved by the UN General Assembly in 1991, with respect to patient's right to an independent psychiatric report. According to the analysis by psychotherapist Elena Romek, provisions of the Russian Mental Health Law are in conflict with civil rights guaranteed by the Constitution of the Russian Federation, universally recognized norms of international law, professional and ethical norms of medicine, and presumption of innocence. According to representatives of the Moscow Helsinki Group (MHG), the Law does not comply with the European practice of mental health care. The case of Rakevich v. Russia considered in the European Court of Human Rights gave grounds for the following assertion by the head of MHG legal programs Natalia Kravchuk: In 2006, the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons issued a warning that in the Russian Federation 'psychiatry is used as a tool against dissent.' As mentioned in 2010, reports on particular cases of psychiatric abuse continue to come from Russia where the worsening political climate appears to make an atmosphere in which local authorities feel able to again use psychiatry as a means of frightening. It is the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia that appears to make very active efforts to communicate their views on the previous and present abuses of psychiatry in Russia to psychiatry in the West. In October 2014 an artist Petr Pavlensky cut his ear while sitting naked on the roof of the infamous Serbsky Center in protest against punitive psychiatry.

In 2011 it was raised to the status of a civil parish. It is south-west of Bath, north-east of Wells, north-west of Frome, and south-east of Bristol. Its geographical location on the A367 from Bath has resulted in it being an important base for services for the population centres of the old Somerset Coalfield area, for which it hosts the police and fire stations and the local further education college. For many years it hosted the annual winter carnival, until in 2014 the carnival route was changed to include Midsomer Norton, Radstock and Westfield. History The Fosse Way Roman road originally ran through this area, between what is now Radstock and Midsomer Norton. Westfield is not mentioned in the Domesday Book.http://www.domesdaybook.co.uk/places.html By the early nineteenth century Westfield still consisted mostly of rural land and coal mining works, with little residential development. It was with the building of large numbers of terraced miners' cottages along the Fosse Way in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries that the area developed into a more populous area in its own right, with Westfield starting to appear on maps http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/maps/index.jsp?layer=europe&xMin;=3162711.68299&yMin;=2792312.07826&xMax;=3165511.68299&yMax;=2795112.07826 and being recognized as a settlement.'Norton-Radstock' in Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: a new survey of universal knowledge (Volume 16, 1961), p. 543: \\"NORTON-RADSTOCK, an urban district (1933) comprising Midsomer Norton, Radstock, Westfield, Writhlington, Haydon and Clandown\\". Modern housing estates were developed on land on both sides of the Fosse Way in the 1970s.http://www.westfield-pc.gov.uk/Core/Westfield-Parish- Council/Pages/Default.aspx For many years, Westfield hosted the Midsomer Norton carnival every November, the only unofficial carnival on the Somerset circuit. The route was moved to Westfield when traffic improvements to Midsomer Norton High Street made the original route prohibitive for the large vehicles. However, in 2014, a new route was established travelling through Midsomer Norton, Radstock and Westfield. Westfield is the site of the 2011 Somerset hot air balloon crash in which two hot-air balloonists who had been attempting to make a high-altitude ascent were killed when their balloon crashed at the Prattens Bowls Club.Two killed in hot air balloon crash in Somerset, BBC News, 1 January 2011 Industry Westfield Trading Estate As in the neighbouring towns and villages, coal mining was an important industry, with the largest mine at Norton Hill in Westfield. In total there were three mines in Westfield, two at Norton Hill and a third at Wells Way. In 1839, the Wells Way pit was the scene of a disaster in which twelve miners died when the rope snapped when they were descending into the pit. A monument recording this event can be found in the cemetery of the Church of St John the Baptist, Midsomer Norton, with an inscription recording the popular belief that that rope was maliciously cut, although nobody was ever apprehended for the alleged act.http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~engcots/MidsomerNortonPhotos.html The seams of coal were thin, and because of the geology they were not easy to work. The Wells Way pit closed in 1920, and the Norton Hill pit in 1966. Despite modernisation in the early 1960s, the pit lapsed into unprofitability due to local geological difficulties and manpower shortages. The Norton Hill colliery at Westfield was owned by the Beauchamp family who owned many of the other collieries and related works on the Somerset Coalfield at various times. It was known as \\"Beauchamp's Goldmine\\", as it was the most productive mine in the whole coalfield.http://www.highlittletonhistory.org.uk/mining.html Westfield is the location of a former Clark's Shoes factory,The parish at westfield-pc.gov.uk and the disused Westfield Quarry lies a short distance to the west of the main built-up area of the parish.Robert Maurice Owens & Michael G.

The Westfield Trading Estate is home to many national and local businesses, including Dickies, Jones Convenience Stores and the Midsomer Norton, Radstock & District Journal. Governance Westfield forms part of the North East Somerset constituency, which elects a Member of Parliament to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It is also part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament. Westfield was formerly part of the parish of Norton Radstock, along with Radstock and Midsomer Norton until May 2011, when it became a parish in its own right.Norton Radstock Town Council meets for last time at bbc.co.uk, accessed 9 September 2011 However, The name Westfield was used for a ward of the former Wansdyke District Council, abolished in 1996. In 1988 it was described as \\"a distinct district on the outer edge of Norton-Radstock\\".New statesman society (Volume 1, Issues 13-21, 1988): On Wansdyke, Dave Chalk represents Westfield, a distinct district on the outer edge of Norton-Radstock containing a mixture of private and council housing, an industrial estate and the Clarks shoe factory...\\" Almost all significant local government functions are carried out by Bath and North East Somerset, a unitary authority, but Westfield also has its own parish council, with mostly consultative functions. The parish council is based in the Oval Office in St Peter's Business Park in Westfield.http://www.westfield-pc.gov.uk/Core/Westfield-Parish- Council/Pages/Local_Information_1.aspx There is one electoral ward in Westfield. The area and population are the same as quoted above for the parish. Geography Waterside Valley, Westfield The northern parish boundary with Midsomer Norton is formed by the disused Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway line that ran between Midsomer Norton South and Bath Green Park stations. This was converted in 2011 into the Five Arches Greenway cycle path that connects Radstock with Norton Hill School, in partnership with Sustrans.http://www.sustrans.org.uk/what-we-do/connect2/schemes/south- west/five-arches-midsomer-norton-connect2-to-radstock Most of the parish consists of residential and industrial development, but at the southern end of the parish below Westfield Trading Estate lies Waterside Valley, where a stream runs through an area of farmland, scrub and an overgrown coal tip north-west of the village of Haydon.http://www.geolocation.ws/map/51.275362,-2.456862/14/en#51.2804,-2.459,17 Education Bath College, Somer Valley site, Westfield There is one first school in Westfield, Westfield Primary School and a school for pupils age 3-19 with complex learning difficulties, Fosseway School. Just outside the Westfield parish boundary lies St Benedict's primary school, actually part of Somerset. There are no mainstream secondary schools within Westfield, but it is served by Norton Hill School and Somervale School in Midsomer Norton and by Writhlington School in Radstock. Westfield has a further education college, the Somer Valley campus of Bath College, which also serves Midsomer Norton, Radstock, Keynsham and surrounding districts. By 2013 the college, then operating independently as Norton Radstock College, had 1,000 full-time students and 5,000 part-time students, having expanded steadily since it opened in the 1940s. A merger with Bath College, which has its main campus in Bath city centre, was completed in 2015. Religious sites Westfield Chapel The first Methodist hall in Westfield was built in 1869. It is now used as the Sunday school. The present church building opened in 1898. St Hugh's Roman Catholic Church on Wells Hill was housed in the former Purnell's printing works but closed as a church in 2015.http://www.somersetguardian.co.uk/Sunday- services-Midsomer-Norton-Radstock-Catholic/story-28213717-detail/story.html The church acquired the building after the First World War.http://www.radstockchurches.org.uk/sthughsrc.php St Peter's Church of England parish church was built in 1988.

Open Fire was filmed in Belsize Park and in around Hampstead, London.https://letterboxd.com/film/open-fire-1994-1/ The film has never been released commercially. Plot The film concerns the manhunt for David Martin, and the events surrounding this in which Stephen Waldorf, a 26-year- old film editor, was mistakenly identified as Martin and shot by police firearms officers. The story focuses on Finch, a young police officer who, at the beginning of the film, is awarded a medal for bravery in the course of duty after he arrested an armed criminal, and David Martin. Martin ‚Äî a transvestite with a provocative and aggressive temperament ‚Äî is released from prison having served his latest sentence. He has escaped twice during his time in custody, and is soon in trouble once again. During the course of a burglary at a private cinema, Martin shoots a police officer as he tries to escape. After he is later arrested, he promptly escapes and goes on the run. By 1983 he is Britain's most wanted man, and a massive police manhunt is under way to apprehend him. As the hunt for Martin intensifies, police identify a suspect whom they believe might be the fugitive, but after he is shot by Finch, he turns out not to be Martin. The car driver fled the scene. Finch is subsequently suspended from duty. The case becomes a police scandal, with Finch accused of attempted murder. Martin is finally caught after being chased into an Underground station and along a railway tunnel, where police eventually corner and arrest him, without any shot fired.

It is a notifiable disease that is found worldwide. It is spread both vertically and horizontally and prevalence is high. It is not zoonotic but the risk to humans that receive pig organ transplants is currently under investigation.  Clinical signs  Clinical signs are normally only seen in either piglets less than 3 weeks old or pregnant sows. Signs in piglets include rhinitis, pneumonia, anaemia, fever and sudden death. Black discoloration around the eyes is often seen and gastrointestinal and neurological signs are also reported. Signs in pregnant sows include reproductive failure, genital ulceration and agalactia.  Diagnosis  A presumptive diagnosis can be made based on the history and clinical signs. Definitive diagnosis is achieved by direct or indirect fluorescent-antibody testing (FAT), PCR, post mortem (signs include petechia and pulmonary congestion), histopathology or electron microscopy.  Treatment and control  Often no treatment is required. However, as Suid betaherpesvirus 2 is a member of Herpesviridae it remains latent and sheds at times of stress.

Development in ankylosing spondylitis has been suspended after the drug failed to show clinical benefit over methotrexate in a phase II trial. Medical uses Sarilumab is used for the treatment of moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis in people who have not responded to, or did not tolerate, more conventional treatments. It can be used alone or in combination with methotrexate or other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).Drugs.com: Sarilumab . Accessed 2017-11-29. Contraindications In Europe, sarilumab is contraindicated in people with active, severe infections. While this is not listed as a contraindication under the US FDA approval, there is a boxed warning that recommends testing for hidden tuberculosis infection before treatment and monitoring for signs of an infection during therapy with sarilumab. Side effects The MONARCH trial suggested a significantly higher incidence of neutropenia in patients receiving 200 mg sarilumab every 2 weeks, compared to patients being treated with adalimumab (13.6% vs 0.5%). However, infection rates were similar between both groups (28.8% vs 27.7%). Other common side effects that occurred in 1% to 10% of patients included thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), infections of the upper respiratory tract and the urinary tract, oral herpes, hyperlipidaemia, and reactions at the injection site.

The name is more probably derived from a corruption of \\"Dudman's Platt\\", from Dudman ‚Äî who is recorded as a resident in 1735 ‚Äî and platt, meaning a plot of land. The monument was erected in 1825 at Harewood Forest, between the villages of Picket Twenty and Longparish, Hampshire, by Lt. Col. William Iremonger. Description The monument consists of a stone cross on a pedestal with plain unmoulded details. On its south side an inscription in Gothic script reads: An inscription on the north side of the plinth reads: \\"This Monument was erected by Col William Iremonger AD MDCCCXXV\\". Legend According to legend, King Edgar I sent his \\"favourite and most trusted\\" earl, √Üthelwald, to meet √Ülfthryth, daughter of Ordgar, the Earl of Devonshire, to assess her suitability as a bride. On meeting her, √Üthelwald was \\"smitten with her beauty\\" and married her himself. √Üthelwald then returned to the king and told him that she was \\"a girl of vulgar and common place appearance, and by no means worthy\\" of the king's hand, while concealing his own marriage to her. Discovering the deception through court gossip, Edgar swore vengeance and arranged a hunt in the Harewood Forest to which he invited √Üthelwald. During the hunt, Edgar murdered √Üthelwald with a javelin, and subsequently took √Ülfthryth as his wife and queen. Historical basis The story of √Üthelwald's murder was first described by William of Malmesbury, a 12th-century historian, in his Gesta regum Anglorum (\\"Deeds of the kings of the English\\"; 1125). William's account was later repeated by David Hume (1711‚Äì1776), a Scottish historian, philosopher, economist, diplomat and essayist, in his 6-volume work The History of England, published between 1754‚Äì1761. Thomas Babington Macaulay (1800‚Äì1859), in his preface to Lays of Ancient Rome (1842), says the story has \\"a most suspicious air of romance\\" and \\"greatly resembles\\" some of the legends of early Rome. Macaulay writes: \\"when we turn to William of Malmesbury, we find that Hume, in his eagerness to relate these pleasant fables, has overlooked one very important circumstance. William does indeed tell both the stories; but he gives us distinct notice that he does not warrant their truth, and that they rest on no better authority than that of ballads.\\" Dead Man's Plack in 2006 Edward Augustus Freeman (1823‚Äì1892) debunks the story as a \\"tissue of romance\\" in his 1875 Historic Essays and writes: \\"The process by which legend gets transmuted into apparent history could not have been better described than it is by Lord Macaulay.\\" Freeman also refers to another contemporary chronicler, Geoffrey Gaimar, whose (\\"History of the English People\\"; 1136‚Äì1140) describes √Üthelwald's death at the hands of unidentified armed men in Wherwell Forest (Harewood Forest). Elizabeth Norton, a historian specialising in the queens of England, concludes that \\"the evidence certainly does not suggest that [√Üthelwald] was murdered\\" and that the story related by William of Malmesbury is \\"a later elaboration\\" of the reason behind √Ülfthryth's foundation of nearby Wherwell Abbey, \\"which was popularly considered to have been carried out as an act of atonement.\\" Dudman's Platt Writing in 2004, historian John Spaul suggests that the name and position of the monument came about as a mistaken derivative of the location's name, \\"Dudman's Platt\\". Dudman is recorded as a resident in 1735 and \\"platt\\" referred to a \\"plot of land\\". Spaul explains: \\"The legend of Edgar and √Ülfthryth as fabricated by romantic poets in the 12th century and related by William of Malmesbury, gave an excuse for Colonel Iremonger, a 19th-century antiquarian, to erect a monument in his part of Harewood Forest. He probably thought he had found evidence of the romantic tale because of the name Dudman's Platt which could be the local pronunciation of Dead Man's Place.\\" In popular culture The story of √Üthelwald's murder was revived by William Henry Hudson (1841 ‚Äì 1922), a naturalist who, \\"fascinated like many before and after by this monument\\", published a romantic version of the legend in his Dead Man's Plack and an Old Thorn (1920). Hudson, who stated that he disliked Freeman \\"because he was so infernally cock-sure, so convinced that he and he alone had the power of distinguishing between the true and false\\", also went to some lengths to discredit the historian's dismissal of the story as untrue. The story is also the subject of The King's Henchman, an opera in three acts composed by Deems Taylor to an English language libretto by Edna St. Vincent Millay. It premiered on 17 February 1927 at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City in a performance conducted by Tullio Serafin. On 18 September 1927 it became the first live opera to be broadcast on CBS Radio when it was performed in a condensed version narrated by the composer. Despite its great success at the time, The King's Henchman soon fell out of the repertory and is now all but forgotten.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. History In the 1910s, a system of three trunk line roads was constructed in Alger County. One of these roads ran from Trenary to Skandia. By the end of the decade, this road was nearly complete; the last link was the construction of a bridge over the Whitefish River. In 1919, the Michigan State Highway Department engineers designed what was designated as Trunk Line Bridge Number 264, based on a standard design that the agency had developed in 1913‚Äì14. The agency awarded the contract to construct the bridge to Samuel Mills of Escanaba. Mills built the bridge in 1919 for $1,688.25. The trunk line, including this bridge, was later incorporated into US 41\\\\. Later still, the highway was re-aligned, and a new bridge was built over the Whitefish River approximately one-half mile south of this bridge. The section of road that included the old bridge was redesignated King Road, and still carries local traffic. Description Side of bridge The King Road‚ÄìWhitefish River Bridge is a girder bridge built on two skewed through girders, supported by concrete abutments and a center pier. The deck is a concrete slab, with the girders rising above to form the guardrails on either side. A bronze plate designating the bridge as a \\"Trunk Line Bridge\\" is mounted on the girders‚Äô inside walls. The structure is fundamentally unaltered, but has undergone a considerable amount of concrete spalling and chipping. The King Road‚ÄìWhitefish River Bridge is notable due in part to its relatively early construction date as a girder- style bridge and its two-span configuration.

The business routes are all sections of state trunkline highway that run through the central business districts of their respective towns connecting them to the mainline highway outside of those downtown areas. These various business routes were formerly part of the routing of US Highway 127 (US 127) or its predecessor in Central Michigan, US 27, before the construction of highway bypasses. The southern two, in Jackson and Mason were previously parts of US 127, while seven of the northern eight (Lansing, St. Johns, Ithaca, St. Louis, Mount Pleasant, Clare and Harrison) were originally part of US 27, a highway which was replaced on its northern end by US 127 in 2002. The business loop through Alma was once numbered US 27A. In the late 1920s, US 27 was shifted to run through St. Louis instead of Alma, and the former route was renumbered US 27A. US 127 was realigned near Mason in the mid-1940s, and a business loop was created out of the former routing there. A similar bypass of Jackson in the late 1950s also spawned a business loop. In the early 1960s, a new expressway (later freeway) for US 27 through Central Michigan led to the creation of several business loops. Other bypasses opened in the 1980s and 1990s and created the last two business loops. The 2002 extension of US 127 to replace US 27 also led to the redesignation of business loops to their current monikers. Jackson Business US Highway 127 (Bus. US 127) is a business loop of US 127 through Jackson that is wholly concurrent with M-50. Its southern end is at an interchange in a rural section of Summit Township. From exit 34 on US 127, the business loop runs north and northwesterly, crossing the Grand River. North of the river, the roadway is bounded by businesses as it runs along Cooper Street through residential areas on the southeastern side of Jackson. In the downtown area, Bus. US 127/M-50 merges with Business Loop Interstate 94 (BL I-94) and splits to follow a one-way pairing of streets that form a loop through downtown. Northbound traffic continues along the eastern side of this loop on Cooper Street and crosses the Grand River again. At the intersection with Michigan Avenue, BL I-94/Bus. US 127/M-50 turns westward onto Louis Glick Highway around the northern side of downtown. The business loop crosses the Grand River a third and final time along Louis Glick. On the western side of downtown, the business loop angles southwesterly as Louis Glick Highway merges into Michigan Avenue. (At the same time, the southern half of the one-way loop, Washington Street, also splits from Michigan Avenue.) BL I-94/Bus. US 127/M-50 follows Michigan Avenue westward through residential neighborhoods to an intersection with West Avenue, where Bus. US 127/M-50 turns northward, separating from BL I-94 (Michigan Avenue). As the business loop approaches its parent highway, it transitions into a commercial area. The northern terminus of Bus. US 127 is at the same interchange northwest of Jackson in Blackman Township where the US 127 and I-94 freeways merge. Jackson was first bypassed on its eastern side around 1959 with a new US 127 freeway. At that time, the former routing of US 127 through downtown was redesignated Bus. US 127. In 1964, several changes were made to the business routes in downtown Jackson. Southbound Bus. US 127 traffic was shifted off Michigan Avenue along Blackstone Street to Washington Avenue, and from there it ran along Washington to Francis Street and back to Michigan Avenue. The northbound traffic was shifted north at Mechanic Street to Pearl Street, continuing until turning south at Blackstone back to Michigan Avenue. The eastern end was updated further in 1968 to use Louis Glick Highway to connect to the northern half of the loop around downtown to Michigan Avenue. A set of connector streets on the western side of the downtown loop opened in November 1969 to streamline the flow of traffic further resulting in the last changes to the BL I-94 routing in Jackson. Southbound traffic was redirected to the connector on Michigan Avenue just east of Third Street. This connector curved south then east to Washington Avenue near First Street. Louis Glick Highway was extended west from Blackstone curving south to merge into Michigan. Major intersections Mason Business US Highway 127 (Bus. US 127) was a business loop that ran through downtown Mason. It started at an intersection on the southern edge of the city where US 127 split from Hull Road to bypass downtown Mason to the west. From there, the business loop ran northward along Hull Road, becoming Jefferson Street. At the intersection with M-36 (Ash Street), Bus. US 127 turned westward and ran concurrently with M-36. After four blocks and a crossing of the Sycamore Creek, Bus. US 127/M-36 turned northward on Cedar Street to Columbia Avenue and then turned westward along Columbia to an intersection with US 127 west of downtown. The state bypassed Mason around 1946, building a new highway to the west of downtown, and the former route of US 127 through downtown was redesignated Bus. US 127. This business loop existed until 1964. At that time, the bypass around Mason was upgraded to a full freeway with an interchange at Cedar Street northwest of downtown. Two segments of highway were turned over to local control at this time: the southern half of Bus. US 127 along Hull Road and Jefferson Street as well as the section of Bus. US 127/M-36 along Columbia Avenue. M-36 was extended northward along Cedar Street to the new interchange, and the Bus. US 127 designation was decommissioned. Major intersections Lansing Business US Highway 127 (Bus. US 127) is a business route in Lansing that is unsigned. The trunkline starts at an intersection with Business Loop Interstate 96 (BL I-96) at the corner of Cedar and North streets in the northern part of the city. Marked as Old US 27 on maps, the business route follows Cedar Street northeasterly and transitions onto East Street. The highway runs through residential areas on the north side of Lansing. Along the route of Bus. US 127, the highway is immediately bounded by some commercial businesses. At Sheridan Road, the highway crosses from Ingham County into Clinton County and continues as a road named Old US 27\\\\. Bus. US 127 continues through suburban southern Clinton County, still bordered by businesses and residential neighborhoods, northward to an interchange with I-69 in DeWitt Township. In 1984, part of the northern freeway bypass of Lansing opened as I-69. At that time, US 27 was rerouted to follow the new freeway. The former routing of US 27 through downtown Lansing was redesignated Bus. US 27 as a business loop along Lansing Road, I-496 and BL I-96 at this time. Eight years later, the last section of I-69 was completed in Michigan. Afterwards, Bus. US 27 was truncated to the interchange between BL I-96/Capitol Loop and I-496, and the state reconfigured it into a business spur into downtown Lansing from the north. In 1999, MDOT petitioned the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials to decommission the US 27 designation in the state; the change was approved on April 16, 1999. The state waited until 2002 to make the change. After the change was implemented, Bus. US 27 was renumbered to Bus. US 127 as with all of the other similar business routes in the state. However, unlike the other new Bus. US 127s, this one had no connection to US 127, its new parent highway. MDOT has retained the business route as an unsigned trunkline designation ever since. Major intersections St. Johns Business US Highway 127 (Bus. US 127) starts at the Price Road interchange along US 127 south of St. Johns. From here, Bus. US 127 follows Price Road to the former US 27 and turns north along South Old US 27\\\\. In the city of St Johns, it is known as Whittemore Street and intersects M-21 (State Street). Bus. US 127 continues north on North Old US 27 to its northern terminus. The northern terminus of Bus. US 127 nearly coincides with the northern end of the existing US 127 freeway in Clinton County. Approximately one-half mile (0.8 km) north of the Bus. US 127 interchange north of St. Johns, the US 127 freeway merges back onto its former alignment to proceed northerly into Gratiot County. The St. Johns Bypass on US 27 opened on August 31, 1998, and the former route of the highway through downtown was redesignated Bus. US 27 afterward. In 1999, MDOT petitioned AASHTO to decommission the US 27 designation in the state; the change was approved on April 16, 1999. The state waited until 2002 to make the change. After the change was implemented, Bus. US 27 was renumbered to Bus. US 127 as with all of the other similar business routes in the state to reflect the new parent highway designation. Major intersections Ithaca Business US Highway 127 (Bus. US 127) is a business loop that runs from an interchange on US 127 on the southern Ithaca city limits through downtown and back to the freeway north of the city. The southern end is at exit 117 on US 127, and from there, the business loop runs westward along Center Street through a cluster of businesses adjacent to the freeway interchange. Further west, Bus. US 127 passes through residential neighborhoods to enter downtown Ithaca. At Main Street, the business loop turns northward one block to Emerson, then turns westward one block along Emerson to Pine River Street, bypassing downtown Ithaca. From there, Bus. US 127 turns northward along the former route of US 27 through town. North of downtown, the highway passes through another residential area before exiting Ithaca. North of town, the business loop passes a golf course before turning eastward a short distance along Polk Road to connect to the freeway. An expressway through Gratiot County opened in late 1961, and US 27 was rerouted to follow it, bypassing Ithaca to the east. The former route of US 27 along Center and Pine River streets in Ithaca was designated Bus. US 27 at this time. On April 26, 1973, the state transferred control over one block of Center Street west of Main Street and one block of Pine River Street south of Emerson Street. At the same time, the city transferred control of one block each of Main and Emerson streets. In 1999, MDOT petitioned AASHTO to decommission the US 27 designation in the state; the change was approved on April 16, 1999. The state waited until 2002 to make the change. After the change was implemented, Bus. US 27 was renumbered to Bus. US 127 as with all of the other similar business routes in the state to reflect the new parent highway designation. Major intersections Alma Business US Highway 127 (Bus. US 127) is a business loop through Alma. The highway starts at a partial interchange for exit 123 on US 127 in a rural area east of Alma. There are a few businesses adjacent to the interchange and an intersection with State Road, which provides access to another partial interchange with US 127 as well as the Bus. US 127 for St. Louis. Continuing westward along Lincoln Road, the landscape along the southern leg of Bus. US 127 comprises farm land. Once the highway enters Alma, the street name changes to Superior Street. Bus. US 127 crosses the Pine River and runs through residential neighborhoods on the eastern side of Alma before entering the downtown area. At an intersection with Wright Avenue to the east of the campus of Alma College, Bus. US 127 turns northward. North of downtown, the business loop crosses another residential area before passed the hospital and more commercial properties. In Pine River Township north of the city, Bus. US 127 intersects M-46 (Monroe Road). M-46 connects the Alma business loop to the St. Louis business loop and a partial interchange with US 127, while the Alma business loop continues less than half a mile (0.6 km) to the partial interchange with US 127 that serves as the business loop's northern terminus. When the state highway system was initially signposted in 1919, the highway running north south through the Alma area was numbered M-14. In 1926, this highway was renumbered as part of US 27\\\\. The new highway designation was supposed to pass through St. Louis instead of Alma, but US 27 initially follows the routing of M-14. By the end of 1929, the mainline of US 27 is shifted to its desired routing through St. Louis, and the former route of it through Alma became US 27A. An expressway through Gratiot County opened in late 1961, and US 27 was rerouted to follow it, bypassing Alma to the east. The former route of US 27A along Lincoln Road/Superior Street and Wright Avenue/Alger Road) in Alger was designated Bus. US 27 at this time. In 1999, MDOT petitioned AASHTO to decommission the US 27 designation in the state; the change was approved on April 16, 1999. The state waited until 2002 to make the change. After the change was implemented, Bus. US 27 was renumbered to Bus. US 127 as with all of the other similar business routes in the state to reflect the new parent highway designation. Major intersections St. Louis Business US Highway 127 (Bus. US 127) is a business loop through St. Louis. The highway starts at an interchange with US 127 south of St. Louis at exit 114\\\\. From there, it follows State Road northward through farmland into the southern edge of town. There, Bus. US 127 follows Main Street through residential areas into downtown. At the intersection with M-46 (Washington Street), the business loop turns westerly along the other highway, running concurrently. The combined highway crosses the Pine River and runs through residential areas as it exits the town. As Bus. US 127/M-46 approaches US 127, it passes several businesses. The business loop terminates at exit 127A near the northern terminus of the Bus. US 127 for Alma. An expressway through Gratiot County opened in late 1961, and US 27 was rerouted to follow it, bypassing St. Louis to the west. The former route of US 27 along State Road/Main Street and M-46 (Washington Street/Monroe Road) in St. Louis was designated Bus. US 27 at this time. In 1999, MDOT petitioned AASHTO to decommission the US 27 designation in the state; the change was approved on April 16, 1999. The state waited until 2002 to make the change. After the change was implemented, Bus. US 27 was renumbered to Bus. US 127 as with all of the other similar business routes in the state to reflect the new parent highway designation. Major intersections Mount Pleasant Business US Highway 127 (Bus. US 127) in Mount Pleasant runs along a former section of US 27 in the city. The business loop starts at a partial interchange with US 127 at exit 139 in Union Township south of town. The exit ramp from the northbound direction of the freeway exits from the left and forms the northbound lanes of the business loop while the southbound lanes of the business loop merge into the southbound direction of the freeway. Bus. US 127 runs to the west as a four-lane divided highway parallel to tracks of the Great Lakes Central Railroad. Near the south end of the city's commercial strip in the township, the two directions of the business loop merge as an undivided highway and follow Mission Street. Mission runs on the eastern edge of the campus of Central Michigan University, including running past Kelly/Shorts Stadium, home field of the Central Michigan Chippewas football team. North of Bellows Street, the blocks to either side of Mission Street takes on a more residential character while the main street continues to be lined with retail and commercial establishments. M-20 merges in from the west at High Street to run concurrently along the business loop. At Pickard Street, M-20 turns east and Bus. US 127 continues through the north end of town. North of Corporate Way in Union Township, the business loop leaves Mission Street and returns to a divided highway, veering northeasterly to connect to exit 144on US 127\\\\. This is also a partial interchange as the northbound lanes from the business loop merge into the northbound lanes of the freeway from the left and the southbound lanes of the business loop are formed from the exit ramp off US 127. The total length of Bus. US 127 in the Mount Pleasant area is . In early 1961, a divided highway section for US 27 was opened in Gratiot and Isabella counties; this routing connected into the former US 27 alignment south of Mount Pleasant at Mission Street. By the end of 1961, the US 27 freeway through Isabella County was completed and the divided highway was upgraded to full freeway status. With this project completed, the connector between the freeway and Mission Street south of Mount Pleasant and the former routing along Mission in town was rechristened Bus. US 27\\\\. A new divided highway connector on the north end of town was built to complete the business route. In 2002, when US 127 replaced US 27 north of Lansing, the Mount Pleasant business loop was given its current moniker to match. Major intersections Clare Business US Highway 127 (Bus. US 127) is a business loop in Clare. The northern half of the route of the highway is shared with Bus. US 10, running concurrently through downtown. The southern end is at a directional interchange with US 127 south of Clare in Isabella County. This interchange provides access to northbound Bus. US 127 from northbound US 127 only, and traffic from the southbound business loop must enter the southbound freeway only. The business loop runs northwesterly away from the freeway to a roundabout intersection with Mission Road. Bus. US 127 turns northward on Mission Road, crossing into Clare County and following McEwan Street through residential areas on the south side of Clare. At the intersection with 5th Street in downtown, Bus. US 10 merges in from the east and M-115 terminates from the west. Bus. US 127/Bus. US 10 passes through a residential area on the north side of the city and crosses the South Branch of the Tobacco River. As the business loop approaches US 127/U.S. Route 10 in Michigan, it follows Clare Avenue past several businesses before terminating at a full interchange with the freeway. An expressway through Isabella and Clare counties opened in late 1961, and US 27 was rerouted to follow it, bypassing Clare to the east. The former route of US 27 along McEwan Street and Clare Avenue was designated Bus. US 27 at this time. A freeway bypass north of Clare and Farwell opened in 1975, and US 10 was rerouted along the US 27 freeway to connect from the new bypass to the existing freeway east of the city, bypassing both cities. The section of US 10 in downtown Clare was designated Bus. US 10 at this time, running along Bus. US 27 to connect to US 27/US 10 north of downtown. In 1999, MDOT petitioned AASHTO to decommission the US 27 designation in the state; the change was approved on April 16, 1999. The state waited until 2002 to make the change. After the change was implemented, Bus. US 27 was renumbered to Bus. US 127 as with all of the other similar business routes in the state. Major intersections Harrison Business US Highway 127 (Bus. US 127) is a business loop running through downtown Harrison. The southern end starts at exit 170 on US 127 and runs concurrently northwesterly and northward along M-61 through rural woodland away from the freeway. The business loop passes through the unincorporated community of Allendale as Park Street and turns northwesterly near the southern end of Budd Lake. Now named 1st Street, Bus. US 127/M-61 enters Harrison and turns northward through residential areas into downtown. At the intersection with Main Street, M-61 separates to the west, and the business loop continues northwesterly parallel to the shore of Budd Lake. Bus. US 127 turns northward and exits Harrison hear the Clare County Fairgrounds. North of town, the business loop runs through the unincorporated community of Ash Acres in Hayes Township before passing the Clare County Airport. Bus. US 127 turns northeasterly through woodland north of the airport and terminates at exit 176 on US 127. An expressway through Clare County opened in late 1961, and US 27 was rerouted to follow it, bypassing Harrison to the east. The former route of US 27 along M-61 and 1st Street/Clare Avenue in Harrison was designated Bus. US 27 at this time. In 1999, MDOT petitioned AASHTO to decommission the US 27 designation in the state; the change was approved on April 16, 1999. The state waited until 2002 to make the change.

Overview A voltage portal avoids voltage exposure for workers by extending the voltage source points to the outside of electrical enclosures. Each voltage point resides in an encapsulated non- conductive housing designed to ensure that a NCVD senses voltage if placed into the voltage portal (Fig. 1). Because a voltage portal contains live voltage and mounts on the outside of an electrical enclosure, it must be robust to ensure long term safety. The UL enclosure type rating of the voltage portal must also match the enclosure rating. Maintenance work Many maintenance workers carry NCVD pens or AC voltage detectors in their tool belts. This portable device allows workers to quickly check electrical conductors for live voltage without actually touching the bare wire. The NCVD can sense voltage when positioned close to the live conductor without making a hard-wired electrical connection. A voltage portal is used to assist workers in creating an electrically safe work condition as part of a lockout-tagout procedure before beginning work on electrical or mechanical equipment.

Under the leadership of Ben Chavis (Lumbee), a Native American professor, AIPCS students made considerable progress in academic scores from 2000 to 2007, and enrollment increased at the school. The first middle school, AIPCS, received national recognition in 2007. Some of Chavis's disciplinary methods and his treatment of students and teachers generated controversy, and he resigned as principal in 2007. But the board voted to maintain him in an influential executive role at the school and with the model school system. In 2012 Chavis ended his ties with the charter system (although his children remained as students) and returned to his home state of North Carolina. For a period, the charter system's charter from the OUSD was at risk, but the school gained a court injunction in 2012 to allow it to continue to operate. With the change in management and in view of the students' achievements in academic scores, the Model School system's charter was renewed in 2013 for a 5-year term. This included an expansion to serve grades K‚Äì4 at AIPCS II.\\"American Indian Charter School Hearing\\" , IBA Buzz blog, 04 April 2012 Overview Established as a small charter school to serve Native American students in Oakland, AICPS had difficulty improving academic performance from its founding in 1996 until after 2000. That year Ben Chavis (Lumbee), was recruited as principal of the school. He recruited new teachers and imposed strong discipline and study protocols. Test scores increased dramatically over the next several years and student enrollment also increased. Student demographics changed, reflecting the diverse population with more students of Asian, African American and Latino ancestry. The AIM system was established in 2007, expanding to an additional two charter schools: another middle school and a high school. The schools were recognized for academic performance, but controversy was generated by Chavis's discipline system and treatment of both students and faculty. He resigned in 2007 but retained influence at the schools.Landsberg, Mitchell. \\"Spitting in the eye of mainstream education.\\" Los Angeles Times. May 31, 2009. 1. Retrieved on September 8, 2011. According to a California state \\"extraordinary audit\\" released in 2012, Chavis directed at least $3.8 million in school payments to businesses owned by him and his wife, Marsha Amador, without proper contracting. The charter board was criticized in the audit for lax financial management and accounting. The Oakland School Board had already requested in 2011 that the California Board of Education revoke and deny renewal of American Indian Public Charter School II's (AIPCS II) charter; this action would have closed that school after the 2011‚Äì2012 academic year.

History The American Indian Public Charter School opened in 1996. It was intended to serve Native American students in the Oakland, California; historically Native Americans had low academic performances in the public schools. Martin Waukazoo, the executive director of the Native American Health Center, was one of the founders of the school. But, shortly after the school was founded, Waukazoo withdrew his support because he believed it put too much emphasis on Native American cultural classes and not enough emphasis on basic educational skills. After its founding, the school had a high staff turnover rate and insufficient funds for textbooks and computers. In 2000 the Oakland Unified School District (OUSD) considered closing the school. Nanette Asimov of the San Francisco Chronicle reported that the school, which had 37 students, was \\"sinking fast,\\" could not keep its students, and did not have \\"viable test scores.\\"Asimov, Nanette. \\"Charter school principal who raised scores to leave, But some parents at American Indian were upset by his methods.\\" San Francisco Chronicle. 27 July 2007; Retrieved on September 9, 2011. Evelyn Lamenti, an employee with the OUSD Office of Indian Education, recruited Ben Chavis (Lumbee), to serve as principal. Formerly a professor at San Francisco State College, Chavis was then teaching at the University of Arizona. Lamenti believed that he would succeed due to his background in education, interest in charter schools, and knowledge of children living in inner-city communities. In 2000 Chavis became the head of the school.Mathews, Jay. \\"A Crazy Idea for Middle Schools.\\" The Washington Post. October 2, 2009. Retrieved on September 8, 2011.

By 2002 the school's enrollment tripled, and its test scores were increasing. For the school year 2006‚Äì2007, Chavis and his board founded the American Indian Model School system, adding the American Indian Charter High School with the beginning of the school year in September 2006. In 2007 AICPS became the first public school in Oakland to win the National Blue Ribbon Award.Murphy, Katy. \\"Oakland public school a contender for the National Blue Ribbon.\\" Oakland Tribune. 10 December 2009; Retrieved on September 13, 2011. Due to complaints from parents and teachers about his treatment, and a provocative incident with Mills College faculty and a graduate student in 2007, OUSD officials asked the AIM governing board to direct Chavis to act in a different manner. In response, the AIM board fined Chavis $700. Kirsten Vital, an OUSD accountability head, said that this was not likely to correct such issues as the Mills incident. On March 15, 2007, Chavis told the AIM school board that he was leaving his post. The minutes of the board meeting said he would remain as a part-time employee. But Chavis said he would return to Arizona. Mitchell Landsberg of the Los Angeles Times reported in 2009 that Chavis \\"remains a presence at the school.\\" The website referred to Chavis as an \\"advisor emeritus.\\" Janet Roberts, a former teacher, succeeded Chavis that year as the head of the school system.

The audit focused on the ASES grant for an after-school program, facilities lease and rent expenditures, and the Political Reform Act of 1974 regarding conflict of interest laws. Oakland Unified School District (OUSD) Charter School Office Director, Gail Greely was responsible for delivering the FCMAT report and monitoring the process. She transferred to become the Director of Charter School Education for Alameda County working for Sheila Jordan. The FCMAT audit report was expected to be released in mid-2012. 2012 Charter renewal hearings During the 2012 charter renewal process for the second middle school, AIPCS II, the Oakland Office of Charter Schools (OCS) found practices in violation of the charter and applicable law. OCS also found lack of responsible governance on the part of the AIPCS governing board, and poor financial accountability. The shortcomings of the school adversely affected parents and students; financial resources were not used to address the needs of students. OCS noted the following strength of the model school system: AIPCS II did pursue its measurable student outcome in its current charter and met its AYP. The following challenges were noted: adherence to proposed educational program and compliance with regulatory elements (financial audits, reporting, enrollment, admissions, Brown Act, Political Reform Act).Review of AIPCS II charter, OUSD Legistar On April 4, 2012, the OUSD board held its AIPCS II charter renewal hearing. OCS recommended denying and revoking the charter. President London of the OCS suggested OUSD could deny the charter and AIPCS II could renew with Alameda County, pending expected results of the state's FCMAT \\"extraordinary audit\\". OCS noted that Chavis had served as both lessee and lessor, that his personal car insurance was paid by the school (the school does not have any cars), and that school checks were made out to a charter board member, among other financial issues. AIM Schools Board President Michael Stember defended AIPCS II and the charter system's new accountant Christina Chen denied all charges. Given the outstanding student achievements, noted in API, and numerous parent, staff, and students who spoke in support of the school, the OUSD board voted 4‚Äì3 to renew the AIPCS II charter for another five years. The board will return to the issue in two years to verify training of the AIPCS governing board and more rigorous accounting practices at the school. The approved charter allowed AIPCS II to expand to include elementary grades K‚Äì4. It became a K‚Äì12 school. See minutes.

Michael Stember resigned from the charter school system board between April and June. Jean Martinez was elected as President of the AIPCS Model School governing board. As reported by SF Gate, \\"The allegations against American Indian charter schools officials include $3.7 million in payments to businesses owned by founder Ben Chavis and his wife, including money for rent, storage fees, construction projects and the administration of summer school programs.\\" On September 27, 2012 the Oakland School Board voted to issue a \\"Notice of violation to American Indian Public Charter School.\\" School Board President Jody London, David Kakashiba, Jumoke Hodge and Gary Yee voted to issue the notice. Chris Dobbins and Alice Spearman voted against it, and Noel Gallo was absent. After issuing the notice of violation, Board Members Yee and Hodge urged concerned parents to recognize that OUSD was not closing the school but \\"curing it.\\" American Indian Public Charter School's Board sued the Oakland School Board and OUSD for what they said was an effort at a hostile takeover of the school. Gail Greely in the OUSD Charter office provided concerned parents with an outline of a school closure process. Charter revocation On January 23, 2013, the OUSD Board voted to issue a \\"Notice of Intent to Revoke\\" to the AIMS charter system and scheduled a public hearing for February 27, 2013. On March 20, 2013, the OUSD board voted 4‚Äì3 to revoke the AIMS charter effective June 30, 2013. Supporters vowed to appeal to the county and state boards of education.\\"Oakland's American Indian Model Schools seek new charter\\", Inside Bay Area During the next months, the Alameda County Board of Education and California Board of Education were expected to review the issues and decide whether to overturn OUSD trustees' decision to revoke the AIMS charter.

A student who misbehaves once in a week receives one after-school detention lasting one hour. A student who misbehaves again in the same week will receive another after-school detention and a four-hour Saturday detention. Landsberg said that by the time students become eighth-graders, \\"discipline is not really an issue. Classes are preternaturally quiet and focused. Visitors may be startled to notice that students do not so much as glance at them. They have been told to keep their attention on their work. They do as they are told.\\" Discipline under Chavis During the Chavis era, students who repeatedly violated rules were humiliated by Chavis or by teachers. The administration often used namecalling, stereotypes, and profanities against students. Some students were forced to hold signs that insulted the students. Robert Gammon of the East Bay Express reported in 2007 that \\"Chavis's boorish behavior has been tolerated because of his school's incredible test scores.\\"Gammon, Robert. \\"Too Hot for School?\\" East Bay Express. May 9, 2007. Retrieved on September 8, 2011. Simone Sebastian of the San Francisco Chronicle reported that in the Chavis era, such disciplinary practices were criticized. Kirsten Vital, accountability head of the Oakland Unified School District, said in a letter to the AIM governing board dated July 9, 2007 that, during a visit to the AIPCS she witnessed, in the words of Nanette Asimov of the San Francisco Chronicle, \\"incidents bordering on educational malpractice, and that came close to child endangerment.\\" Vital cited Chavis using the words \\"darkies\\" and \\"whities\\" to refer to racial and ethnic backgrounds in front of students, Chavis referring to a former employee as a \\"white b --\\" while in the presence of students, and the school forcing a girl to clean a boys' restroom as a punishment for bad behavior. A poster in the AIPCS hallway included a quote from Chavis, saying \\"You do outstanding things here and you'll be treated outstanding. You act like a fool and you'll be treated like one.\\" Landsberg said in 2009 that the concept was still active at AIMS schools, but had been \\"toned down\\" since Chavis left his post as head of the system. Philosophy Under Chavis, the school system's administration opposed to U.S. liberal philosophies, and it promoted free-market capitalism. Chavis opposed teacher's unions. Landsberg reported that the AIM system schools \\"sometimes seem like creations of television's Colbert Report and that the AIM system schools \\"mock liberal orthodoxy with such zeal that it can seem like a parody.\\" American conservatives praised Chavis and the AIM Schools. Columnist George Will said he favored the charter school system because its \\"new paternalism\\" could close achievement gaps between socioeconomic classes. School uniforms Students are required to wear school uniforms. Students wear white shirts and dark- colored trousers. The school does not permit students to wear makeup, jewelry, or brightly colored hair accessories. Demographics =Student body= American Indian Public Charter School ethnic breakdown by year, from 1996/1997 to 2008/2009 From 2000 to 2012, the demographics of the schools in this charter system have changed markedly, and by 2012 served a student body that was 90% Asian American. In 2000 the small AIPCS had a 62% Native American student body. In 2001 the school increased its enrollment to about 100 students. Fifty-two percent of the students were Native American. According to Chavis, during that year 12 to 15 percent of the children were homeless. During Chavis's tenure, the proportion and number of Native American students in AIPCS and the new schools decreased. In 2005 twenty percent of the students were Native American.Sebastian, Simone. \\"HARD LINE, TOP SCHOOL.\\" San Francisco Chronicle. 16 December 2005. 2. Retrieved on September 11, 2011. In 2006 the percentage of Native Americans was more than 13%. By that year the school began to receive many Asian Americans from Laurel. In the 2010‚Äì2011 school year, the AIM system had more than 86% Asian American students, while the overall Oakland Unified School District was 13% Asian. In 2010-2011, the school had no Native American students. As of 2012 more than 90% of the AIPCS student body was Asian American. The next largest ethnic groups were African Americans and Hispanic Americans. In 2009 almost all of the students were low income. Ellen Cushing of the East Bay Express reported that the demographics had become \\"homogenous\\" and that the demographic change was \\"an ironic twist for a school that was originally intended to serve American Indians‚Äîand which is still thought of by many as a haven for a population that's struggled mightily with institutional oppression.\\"Cushing, Ellen. \\"Are American Indian Public Charter School's Test Scores Inflated?\\" East Bay Express.

During the same year, John Melvin, the principal of Lincoln Elementary School, a high-performing OUSD elementary school, said that 75% of his students went to nearby AICPS II, although they had previously attended the public Westlake Middle School. Cushing reported that \\"AIPCS II is mere blocks away from Lincoln, making it a defacto neighborhood school.\\" She reported that Gary Yee, an OUSD board member and husband of a Lincoln Elementary teacher, said AICPS II had a \\"rigorous teaching style [...] similar to what you might find in an elite East-Asian school, perhaps making it more appealing to Lincoln's overwhelmingly Asian-American parent base.\\" Several Chinese-American parents of AIMS students expressed support in 2012 for the school's rigorous methods.Chiang, Summer and Peter Schurmann. \\"For Chinese Parents, Success Outweighs Scandal at Oakland School\\", New America Media.

The regular teacher does not teach physical education. In most American middle schools, teachers specialize in different subjects and teach different classes, with students moving among teachers. Mitchell Landsberg of the Los Angeles Times reported, \\"Five minutes per passing period might not sound like much, but over the course of a year, American Indian saves the equivalent of more than a week's worth of instruction.\\" A middle school class's given teacher is to stay with his or her given class for all three years, until the class graduates. But Landsberg reported in 2009 that it is \\"a policy that seems to be more theory than reality, given high teacher turnover.\\" Each middle school day begins with three hours of language arts and mathematics classes. For middle school students English and mathematics make up 90 minutes per day. Afterwards, students have a twenty-minute lunch period. During each day, students have 45 minutes' worth of physical education instruction. The school system has few classes that do not directly affect standardized test scores. Carey Blakely, a former American Indian system teacher, said that \\"I don't see it as teaching to the test. I see it as, there are certain skills and knowledge that you're supposed to impart to your students, and the test measures whether your students have acquired those skills and that knowledge.\\" The school system only allows instruction in arts to take place after school. The AIM system schools do not have laboratory equipment for science classes. Because of this and the school's emphasis on learning from textbooks, Landsberg said \\"it is hard to imagine that American Indian will turn out the next Darwin or Edison.\\" AIM classrooms do not have computers and televisions.Landsberg, Mitchell. \\"Spitting in the eye of mainstream education.\\" Los Angeles Times.

He believed they could invite theft and lead to unforeseen expenses. Students are assigned homework, so they generally have at least two hours of work to do each night. Students at the AIM system middle schools are required to attend two weeks of summer school each summer.

If a charter school has more prospective students than room available to house them, the charter school has to hold a lottery. The AIM school system, as of 2009, has never held a lottery. Ben Chavis and Janet Roberts, a school principal in the AIM system, said that AIM never received enough students to require the system to hold a lottery. In the fall of 2008 the State of California did not allow the AIM system to open a new campus, partly because, according to the authority, the administrators were \\"unable to describe\\" the system's selection process. Chavis and Roberts said in 2009 that the American Indian system attracts representative samples of students from various public elementary schools in Oakland. Ron Smith, the principal of Laurel Elementary School and a parent of two AIM system children, said that of the children who went from Laurel to the AIM system, \\"I'd say 70% are academically strong, and 30% are a cross-section. ... They have kids who I know could go anyplace in the state and succeed.\\" The AIM school system did not disclose the elementary school test scores of its students. Mitchell Landsberg of the Los Angeles Times could not determine whether the students at American Indian middle schools had above average scores in the elementary school grades. In a letter dated June 9, 2006 sent to the Oakland Unified School District (OUSD), a parent said that when she tried to register her child at AIPCS officials said that they were not accepting students and were not placing children on waitlists. She said that when she talked to a White coworker afterwards, the coworker said that his son received a spot on the waitlist. The writer of the letter said that Chavis had told the coworker that the school needed more White students, so the child would be placed at the top of the waitlist.Gammon, Robert. \\"Chavis in Hot Water.\\" East Bay Express.

Mitchell Landsberg of the Los Angeles Times said that the other two AIM schools \\"are not far behind.\\" The state API target is 800. The state average of public middle and high schools is 750. The state average of schools with underprivileged students is 650. Of the public schools in California, during that year four middle schools and three high schools had higher API scores than AIPCS; none of them had student bodies of mostly underprivileged students. Mitchell Landsberg stated that while critics of the school often said that the high number of Asian American students causes the test scores to be high, the African American and Hispanic students \\"do roughly as well‚Äîin fact, better on some tests\\" so \\"[t]hat makes American Indian a rarity in American education, defying the axiom that poor black and Latino children will lag behind others in school.\\" In 2008, Janet Roberts, the head of the AIM system, said that the speculation that the increased numbers of Asian students caused test scores to go higher demonstrated that the educational establishment has low expectations of low-income African American, Hispanic and Latino, and Native American children. Landsberg said that the school system has high performance because it \\"attracts academically motivated students, relentlessly (and unapologetically) teaches to the test, wrings more seat time out of every school day, hires smart young teachers, demands near-perfect attendance, piles on the homework, refuses to promote struggling students to the next grade and keeps discipline so tight that there are no distractions or disruptions. Summer school is required.\\" Landsberg added \\"There is no secret to any of this. Portions of the American Indian model resemble methods used by the KIPP charter schools or, for that matter, urban parochial schools.\\" Between 2001 and 2005, while AIPCS was under Ben Chavis, the API increased by over 200% to 880, making it, in 2005, the middle school in Oakland with the highest API. The next highest Oakland middle school was almost 80 points lower than AIPCS. In 2008, every AIM system eighth grader scored either a \\"proficient\\" or a higher rating in the State of California algebra examination. In California, half of the eighth graders overall took algebra. Of all of the state's eighth grade students who took algebra, fewer than half scored \\"proficient\\" or higher. Kevin Drum of Mother Jones argued that while the AIMS schools get high test scores, the teaching style may not get the same results in every type of school. Drum cited the small sizes of AIMS schools and that the system \\"plainly attracts only parents and children who are academically motivated in the first place\\" and \\"requires middle school teachers to teach every subject and keeps them on a grueling pace, which means lots of turnover.\\" Drum further argued that \\"the odds that the AIPC formula is scalable to an entire school district is nil.\\" =Student progress= Ron Smith, the principal of Laurel Elementary School, disclosed the middle school test scores of the 51 students from Laurel who entered the AIM system in 2004, showing their progress in English and mathematics between the 6th and 8th grades. Landsberg said \\"It's impossible to tell whether the students were academically strong at the start of sixth grade or were brought up to grade level by the rigors of a year at American Indian.\\" Of the students from Laurel who had completed the 6th grade at the AIM system, 39 finished all three years at the AIM system. Of the 51 students, six scored lower than proficient in both English and mathematics during the end of their 6th-grade year. Three of them left the AIM system and, according to Landsberg, the remaining three \\"showed some progress\\" by the end of their final year. Landsberg said that he could not determine why the three students left the school. The school system stated that, in 2009, it had never expelled any student for any reason, and that some students voluntarily leave because they moved or because the families decided that the school is not well suited to them. Around 2005, the school overall loses 10 students per year. Chavis said that most students moved out. Some parents quoted in the San Francisco Chronicle said they removed their children because they were dissatisfied with the authoritarian environment. Chavis said that he encouraged some students to leave. Patricia Gimbel, the dean of admissions for Deerfield Academy, a private university preparatory school in Massachusetts, said in 2005 that AIPCS had \\"taken kids who are not the brightest and propelled them to the top of state standards.\\" Betty Olson-Jones, the president of the Oakland Education Association, the teachers' union of the Oakland schools, said that the AIM system \\"had a reputation among the local public schools as being very interested in kind of recruiting kids who are going to do well, and getting rid of kids who won't.\\" Ben Chavis and Janet Roberts, a school principal in the AIM system, said that this was not true.

Plot The warlord, Bartatua, is uniting all the Hyrkanian tribes east of the Vilayet Sea into an army for world conquest, beginning with the resistant city of Sogaria. Meanwhile, an exiled Turanian wizard, Khondemir, plans on taking control over Bartatua's soldiers in pursuit of his own agenda. Caught in the middle are Princess Ishkala of Sogaria, a seductive spy named Lakhme, and the enslaved Conan, who must prove his loyalty towards Bartatua to escape his fate. Everything comes to a thrilling climax near an ancient Hyrkanian necropolis known as the City of Mounds. Reception Don D'Ammassa, writing of Roberts' Conan novels, noted that \\"[a]lthough Roberts did not recreate Howard's character exactly, making him more intellectual and less inclined to solve every problem by hitting it with a sword, his evocation of the barbaric setting is superior to that of most of the other writers contributing to the series.

He was the seventh, but third surviving son of Sir Francis Slingsby and Mary de Percy, daughter of Sir Thomas Percy, executed for his part in the Pilgrimage of Grace, and sister of Thomas Percy, 7th Earl of Northumberland, and Henry Percy, 8th Earl of Northumberland. The Percies were descendants of Saer de Quincy, 1st Earl of Winchester. He was born in Scriven, Knaresborough, West Riding. After marrying Elizabeth Broard, daughter of Sir Stephen Broad of Broadshill, Sussex in 1582, the couple took a Grand Tour of Europe, returning in 1594. In 1596, Slingsby discovered that water from the Tewit Well mineral spring at Harrogate, possessed similar properties to that from Spa, Belgium. In 1596 Slingsby served as a soldier on the Cadiz expedition, and again in 1597 against Spain. He purchased the estate of Kippax, West Yorkshire from Francis Bailden. In 1601 he was made the junior Member of Parliament for Knaresborough alongside his brother Sir Henry Slingsby, serving until 1611. He was knighted in 1603. After retiring from soldiering, he was made Deputy Lieutenant for Middlesex in 1617. He was elected MP for Appleby in 1626. He died in 1634, leaving a son, Henry, who became Master of the Mint, and a daughter, and was buried in Knaresborough church. He had several distinguished nephews, including Sir Henry Slingsby, 1st Baronet, Guildford Slingsby, and Sir Robert Slingsby, 1st Baronet.
