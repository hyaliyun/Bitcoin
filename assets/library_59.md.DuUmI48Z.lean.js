It is native to parts of Europe and introduced to the United States and Canada, Great Britain, and Sweden. Petrorhagia saxifraga is also known as tunic saxifrage, pink saxifrage, or just pink. It is a wiry plant with numerous branching stems, narrow leaves, and flowers growing solitary at the ends of branches. The petals range from pink to white. It is commonly cultivated in rock gardens and used along borders, escaping to grow in lawns, along roadsides, along shorelines, and in other sandy disturbed areas. Tunic flower was originally described as Dianthus saxifragus by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 and renamed Petrorhagia saxifraga in 1831. The genus and species name refer to its natural habitat: rock crevices. Two subspecies are accepted: *Petrorhagia saxifraga subsp. gasparrinii (Guss.)

A messenger line or just messenger is relatively light cordage used to pull a heavier cable across a gap or through a tube or duct. The term is also used for a line used to pull or lower a package along a downline or jackstay. A heaving line is a rope with a weighted end which can be thrown relatively easily across a gap. If it is attached to a heavier line, warp, or chain and then used to pull the heavier line across the gap it is being used as a messenger line. The name heaving line refers to the function of being thrown, and messenger line to the function of transferring the object it is fastened to.  Applications  * A heaving line thrown from a ship to shore then used to pull the mooring warp from the ship to a bollard. * A light line installed inside a mast during manufacture, which is later used to reeve a halyard or pull an electrical cable into place. * A line used to lower a toolbag or equipment along a downline to a diver. * A line used to lower a weight (messenger) along a taut line to trigger a mechanism.

Fiestas patronales (patron saint festivals) are held in the central plaza every year. History Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States conducted its first census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Pueblo barrio was 991. The central plaza history The central plaza, or square, is a place for official and unofficial recreational events and a place where people can gather and socialize from dusk to dawn. The Laws of the Indies, Spanish law, which regulated life in Puerto Rico in the early 19th century, stated the plaza's purpose was for \\"the parties\\" (celebrations, festivities) (), and that the square should be proportionally large enough for the number of neighbors (). These Spanish regulations also stated that the streets nearby should be comfortable portals for passersby, protecting them from the elements: sun and rain. Sectors Barrios (which are like minor civil divisions) in turn are further subdivided into smaller local populated place areas/units called sectores (sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanizaci√≥n to reparto to barriada to residencial, among others. The following sectors are in Toa Alta barrio- pueblo: , and .

As was customary in Spain, in Puerto Rico, the municipality has a barrio called pueblo which contains a central plaza, the municipal buildings (city hall), and a Catholic church. Fiestas patronales (patron saint festivals) are held in the central plaza every year. History Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States conducted its first census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Toa Baja Pueblo was 1,300. The central plaza history The central plaza, or square, is a place for official and unofficial recreational events and a place where people can gather and socialize from dusk to dawn. The Laws of the Indies, Spanish law, which regulated life in Puerto Rico in the early 19th century, stated the plaza's purpose was for \\"the parties\\" (celebrations, festivities) (), and that the square should be proportionally large enough for the number of neighbors (). These Spanish regulations also stated that the streets nearby should be comfortable portals for passersby, protecting them from the elements: sun and rain.

It is commonly known as the mulberry whelk and is found in shallow waters in the Indo-Pacific and around the north and east coasts of Australia. Description The mulberry whelk has a strong, robust shell and can grow to about but a more normal adult size is . Each body whorl has five rows of purple or blackish, roughly square, nodules separated by pale grey areas with fine sculptured vertical and horizontal lines. The lip is curved with four similar-sized ridges or teeth on its inner surface. The columella, or central axis, is white and is stout with a smooth surface. The interior of the shell is purple-grey, contrasting with the cream teeth and lip. Distribution and habitat The mulberry whelk is found on the north and east coasts of Australia and on islands in the central Indo-Pacific Ocean. In Australia, its range extends from the north west tip to Twofold Bay in New South Wales. It is common on rocks in the intertidal zone where adults hide in cracks. It is also found in estuaries where it is known as the black oyster borer because it feeds on oysters where it is regarded as a pest. Biology The mulberry whelk is a predator feeding almost exclusively on molluscs and barnacles. It has an extensible rasping radula with which it drills a hole through it victim's shell. The process is believed to be assisted by the sulphuric acid it produces in its salivary glands which helps to soften and dissolve the calcium carbonate in the mollusc's shell. It then uses its radula to cut the soft body of its victim in pieces before sucking the semidigested mass out. The mulberry whelk does not usually move around much when both crevices in which to hide and prey species are in the vicinity. This is in contrast to the rather similar Thais orbita which makes foraging movements up the beach well away from the sheltered niches to which it retreats at low tide. Favoured prey includes oysters and the limpet Patelloida latistrigata. The barnacle Chamaesipho columna was also eaten, but was avoided when more attractive prey was present.

The central plaza history Central plaza (square) of Yabucoa in Yabucoa barrio-pueblo The central plaza, or square, is a place for official and unofficial recreational events and a place where people can gather and socialize from dusk to dawn. The Laws of the Indies, Spanish law, which regulated life in Puerto Rico in the early 19th century, stated the plaza's purpose was for \\"the parties\\" (celebrations, festivities) (), and that the square should be proportionally large enough for the number of neighbors (). These Spanish regulations also stated that the streets nearby should be comfortable portals for passersby, protecting them from the elements: sun and rain. In the plaza is the Catholic Church .

In 1899, the United States conducted its first census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Pueblo barrio was 1,838.

In 1899, the United States conducted its first census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Pueblo was 1,081. As was customary in Spain, in Puerto Rico, the municipality has a barrio called pueblo which contains a central plaza, the municipal buildings (city hall), and a Catholic church. Fiestas patronales (patron saint festivals) are held in the central plaza every year. The central plaza history Jose Rosado Negron pedestrian zone, Vega Alta barrio-pueblo, Puerto Rico The central plaza, or square, is a place for official and unofficial recreational events and a place where people can gather and socialize from dusk to dawn. The Laws of the Indies, Spanish law, which regulated life in Puerto Rico in the early 19th century, stated the plaza's purpose was for \\"the parties\\" (celebrations, festivities) (), and that the square should be proportionally large enough for the number of neighbors (). These Spanish regulations also stated that the streets nearby should be comfortable portals for passersby, protecting them from the elements: sun and rain.

In the same year, at Montefiore Hospital in New York City, building on the success of Dr Saul Hertz's use of radioactive iodine to treat Graves' Disease, Seidlin consulted with Dr. Hertz regarding the use of RAI in the treatment of thyroid carcinoma. Dr Seidlin administered radioiodine to a patient, and used the radioisotope to locate the several metastases from adenocarcinoma of the thyroid. Seidlin continued as chief of the Endocrine Clinic and the Medical Physics Research Laboratory at Montefiore and treated 23 patients for metastatic thyroid cancer with radioiodine, utilizing from reactors for most of them.

Life and career Born in Accra, Bello FiGo moved to Italy in Parma with his family in 2004. In 2010 he started to publish self-produced music videos on his own YouTube channel. In a first moment he used the nicknames Bello FiGo Gucci and Gucci Boy but the popularity of his videos caused that when people searched \\"Gucci\\" in Italian web search engines the first search engine results were about him instead of the Italian brand of fashion Gucci. This caused him to be sued by the company, then withdrawn following a consensual agreement with which Bello FiGo renounced the use of the name Gucci. Bello FiGo's songs are done in an intentionally poor style called \\"trash rap\\" because of the low technical-stylistic quality of his rap music accompanied by bizarre, surreal, satirical and often grammatically incorrect texts. His music videos, published only on YouTube, have totaled millions of views (for example, the song \\"Non Pago Affitto\\" has as of January 2020 over 26 millions views) and have made Bello FiGo a phenomenon of the Internet in Italy. After the first songs, characterized mainly by topics of vulgarity and sexism, Bello FiGo took over from 2016, with the songs \\"Sono bello come profugo\\", \\"Non Pago Affitto\\" and \\"Referendum Costituzionale\\", a more political role, applying his style and its self-irony to the stereotypical arguments inherent in immigrants in Italy, described as being mostly nasty and delinquent. He also mocked, besides these stereotypes, various political figures. For this reason in 2016 he was defined by Rolling Stone music magazine as \\"the most politicized artist in Italy\\", and between the end of 2016 and the beginning of 2017, it suffered several disputes and threats of violence, even of racist background, by groups and subjects close to the extreme right, that led to the cancellation of some of his concerts for fear of public tensions and disorders (in Brescia, in Borgo Virgilio, in Legnano and in Rome). On 30 April 2018 he published Swag negro. Non ce la fa nessuno, an autobiographical book. In December 2019 Bello FiGo was sued by the University of Pisa and its rector, Paolo Mancarella, that declared, after being contacted by the AGI, that the University would have done everything to defend its honour and reputation, because of a song about sex Bello FiGo has published on his official YouTube channel on 6 December 2019, \\"Trombo a facolt√†\\", that was recorded inside the classes of economics of the University, which declared that its staff didn't know anything about it and didn't give its authorization to record the video.https://www.rollingstone.it/musica/news-musica/bello-figo-denunciato- dalluniversita-di-pisa-per-il-video-di-trombo-a- facolta/491586/https://www.iltempo.it/cronache/2019/12/11/news/bello-figo- trombo-a-facolta-video-hot-universita-pisa-denuncia- modelle-1254077/https://voxnews.info/2019/12/11/trombo-a-facolta-bello-figo- gira-video-sconcio-alluniversita-di-pisa/ In February 2020 he released the song \\"CoronaVirus\\" that got over 5 million views on YouTube.

Between 1989 and 2006, he killed at least 23 people in France, Switzerland and Germany, and confessed to killing about 150. If corroborated, that would make him the most prolific French serial killer of the 20th century.  Biography  = Childhood = Yvan Keller was born on December 13, 1960, in Wittenheim, Haut-Rhin. His parents were basket makers and sedentary travellers who had 8 other children, all of them living on Bourg Street. His father, Joseph, was employed in Alsace's potash mines. Keller grew up in a rather unstable family, as his father forced him to work hard so they could survive. His mother died at age 49. This busy life took Yvan behind bars at the age of 17 for stealing two antiques in Battenheim in 1981. Keller was arrested and sentenced to 10 years in prison for robbery. = The man with two faces = In August 1989, Keller was released. He moved to Mulhouse on Verdun Street, in the apartment of an old mansion in a quiet and green area, away from the city center. He became a landscape gardener and created a small company: Alsa-Jardin. His clients were very satisfied with his work and frequently recommended him. He led a modest life, living with a woman named Marina, but they later separated and he found a new companion named S√©verine. Keller's neighbors said that he was very helpful, friendly and affectionate with animals. Marina, Keller's first companion, said he had forced her into prostitution because he was in constant need of money because of his love for luxury, casinos, horse racing, great restaurants and big-name hotels. One of his friends said that while he was in relationship with his second wife S√©verine, she was already in a relationship with another man. When he learned of this, Keller went to see the man and put a gun in his mouth, threatening him to leave his wife alone. So, there were two faces of Yvan Keller: for his neighbors and colleagues, he was \\"everybody's gentleman\\", while for his family, he was a ruthless and angry man.  Murders and subsequent investigation  In January 1994, at Burnhaupt-le-Haut, Basse Street resident Marie Winterholer was found dead in her bed, lying on her back. The doctor concluded that it was a natural death and issued a license to bury. On March 12, 1994, at 11 Basse Street, a man named Germain had decided to visit his 86-year-old mother, Ernestine Mang. Just behind the door, he was surprised to find an old butter churn, which had been stored in the house's cellar for years. He then found his mother dead in bed, lying on her back. He was surprised that the bedding was flawlessly drawn, because Ernestine had trouble moving due to hip problems. Because of this, Germain was convinced that it wasn't her who had moved the churn. On April 27, 1994, at 22 Basse Street, 77-year-old Augusta Wassmer was also found dead in her bed, lying on her back. No break-in was observed, but her daughter Marie-Fran√ßoise Roecklin found that the bed was too well done. The autopsy concluded with a death by cardiac arrest, probably \\"due to great fear\\". Later, Marie-Fran√ßoise noticed that Augusta's bank card and a key to the house had disappeared, and that the card had been used in Mulhouse to make three withdrawals. After his arrest, Keller acknowledged the murders of 150 people. Yvan Keller was implicated in 23 murders of old ladies, but is suspected of having killed 40. As a landscape gardener, Keller could easily locate the houses of his victims. He killed old people so he could steal their valuables, such as money, paintings and jewels, which he would later sell to junk dealers. He would repeat the same scenario each time: he stifled his victims in their bed, then remade the bed to perfection so it would look like a natural death. = Arrest = Between 1993 and 2003, Yvan Keller was denounced 3 times, but the first two did not follow through. The third, after 3 years of investigation, led to his arrest. Keller quickly confessed, advancing the number of victims to 150, admitting to have been active in Alsace, Switzerland and Germany. He was only indicted for five deaths: three in Haut-Rhin in 1994 and two in Bas-Rhin. Eight murders, now investigated, could have completed the list, with investigators finding similarities in other cases as well.  Death  On September 22, 2006, Yvan Keller committed suicide at the Mulhouse High Court. He killed himself using his shoelaces, intertwining them to form a rope that he inserted into the neon of one of the court jails.

His paternal uncle was the anatomist Jacob B. Winslow. With support from Christian VI, Winsl√∏w travelled to first England and then Paris where he trained as a medal engraver under Mikkel R√∏g. Career Winsl√∏w converted to Catholicism and was in 1737 engaged as French court medallist. He mainly worked with renewal of old pistons. He left the position in 1744 when he was called back to Denmark. On 5 July 1745, he was appointed as Danish court medallist. He created a medal commemorating Christian's births in 1745 and Christian VI's death in 1746, the coronation of Frederick V in 1747, the royal anniversary in 1749, Queen Louise's death in 1752, the wedding of Frederick V and Juliane Marie's coronation that same year. He also renewed some coin pistons dating from the early reign of Frederick V. His work soon turned out to be under the expected standard. The Royal Academy of Science commissioned a series of jetons commemorating the rule of Frederick VI but it was never completed.

Early life and education  K√∂rber-Grohne was born in Hamburg. Her father Ernst Grohne was an archaeologist and museum curator in Bremen. She studied biology at university, graduating from Braunschweig Technical University in 1948.  Career  In 1949 she began work at the Lower Saxony State Institute for Marsh and Wound Research in Wilhelmshaven, where she studied archaeology and geology of the Lower Saxony coastal area. Her early work utilised pollen analysis to study vegetation history. Methodological advances included the identification of cereal pollen. She took over the archeobotanical analysis in the archaeological excavation project of the settlement Feddersen Wierde where studied a large assemblage of waterlogged plant remains. This study was pioneering in the development of identification methods and the identification of past plant communities on the basis of archaeobotanical remains, the publication of which \\"set new standards for archaeobotany\\". After a family break and the death of her husband K√∂rber-Grohne moved in 1970 to the University of Hohenheim and worked at the local Botanical Institute under Burkhard Frenzel. In the following years she was involved in the field of archaeobotany in southern Germany. She habilitated with her research work on Feddersen Wierde and was appointed as a professor in 1970. During this period she worked on a range of archaeological projects in south-west Germany, including archaeobotanical remains from the Roman castellum of Welzheim, and the from the grave of a Halstatt chief at Hochdorf. She developed methodologies for the identification of ancient textile fragments, including a study of Viking finds from Haithabu. K√∂rber-Grohne retired in 1988, after which she continued to produce academic research. A key study was on the history of cherries, damsons, plums and sloes.

Development and design In 1933‚Äì1934, the VVS announced a requirement for a 2-engine multirole aircraft of the 'air cruiser' class, building upon the concepts incorporated in the R-6 and MI-3. According to the draft, the ANT-30 was to be carried out according to the scheme of an all-metal twin-engine aircraft with a smooth skin and normal tail. When considering possible projects, special attention was paid to the effectiveness of offensive and defensive small arms and cannon weapons. A firing point with two ShKAS machine guns was located in the anterior ascending domed installation; In the fuselage cargo compartment in the \\"cruiser\\" version, there was an additional fuel tank; The total bomb load reached 1000 kg. The Air Force made ANT-30 aircraft TTT, carried out aerodynamic calculations, made models, prepared design documentation for the construction of a prototype, and pilot production began. But all the works were gradually curtailed at the end of 1933 - at the beginning of 1934, at this point the technical readiness of the ANT-30 was estimated at 16%. The reason was the decision to switch to a more promising type of aircraft - ANT-40 (SB), as well as the gradual withering away of the concept of a universal cruiser type aircraft.Gordon, Yefim; Rigmant, Vladimir (2005).

He was admitted at Inner Temple in 1701 and matriculated at Balliol College, Oxford on 18 May 1702, aged 16. In 1704, he succeeded his uncle Hon. Charles Leigh and inherited the Leighton Buzzard estates in Bedfordshire. He married. Lady Barbara Lumley daughter of Richard Lumley, 1st Earl of Scarbrough in 1716. Leigh's father died in November 1710, and he stood at a by-election at Warwick on 13 December1710 against the Greville interest. He was elected Member of Parliament in a contest and was classed as a Tory and named as a ‚Äòworthy patriot‚Äô who helped expose the mismanagements of the previous Whig government. He offended some Tories for abstaining on 24 January1712 when the House voted on the motion censuring the Duke of Marlborough for his ‚Äòunwarrantable and illegal‚Äô acceptance of money from bread contractors. As a result, he damaged his political standing at Warwick. He also voted 'whimsically' on 18 June 1713 against the French commerce bill. At the 1713 general election, he expected not to be put forward for Warwick, but made no attempt to find another constituency. In the following year his maternal uncle, Hon. Thomas Watson Wentworth, returned him for Higham Ferrers at a by-election on 12 March 1714 and he was returned again at the 1715 general election. Having been a Tory who might often vote Whig, Leigh became a strong opponent of Walpole's administration and from 1715, voted against the Government in all recorded divisions. At the 1722 general election, he changed his seat to Bedfordshire. In 1725, he voted against the restoration of Bolingbroke‚Äôs estates with four other Tories. He did not stand at the 1727 general election, but was returned for Bedfordshire at a by-election on 16 February 1733. He voted against the Administration on the excise bill in 1733, and the repeal of the Septennial Act, in 1734. He was defeated at the 1734 general election and not stand again.

It was built by Samuel Dash in 1780 for the storage of ice gathered from local ponds and canals. The structure came into the ownership of William Leftwich, a leading figure in the London ice trade, who used it to store imported Norwegian ice which he sold to the food and drinks industry. The well was abandoned in the mid-to-late 19th century and covered over. It was rediscovered in good condition during development works in 2014. The well was listed as a scheduled ancient monument in 2015 and there are plans to make it available for visits by the general public.  Description  The ice well is a 9.5m deep and 7.5m wide egg-shaped underground structure originally used for the storage of ice. It is situated in the City of Westminster between the John Nash properties of Park Crescent West and buildings on Portland Place. The site, just south of Regent's Park, is now one of London's most desirable areas. The structure was built of bricks with a London Clay lining, though the top metre of the structure was coated in a cement render and may have originally protruded from the ground. The brickwork, laid in English bond, is of a higher standard than that of the surrounding buildings. The main internal chamber may have originally been subdivided and access and ventilation was provided by a 650mm square hole at the top of the chamber, through which ice would have been raised and lowered. The ice was insulated with hay and a drain was provided at the base of the chamber for the removal of meltwater. An above-ground entranceway, 1.3m wide and roofed with Yorkstone slabs, provided access to the chamber by means of a timber door. A side room off this entranceway may have been used as a vault for the storage of perishable goods.  History  Ice wells or ice houses have been constructed in England since the 1600s as a means of preserving ice gathered from lakes and rivers in winter until the summer months. Most of the structures known today are located at country houses. In 1780 Samuel Dash of Harley Street, who rented land in Park Crescent West, requested permission from his landlord ‚Äì the Surveyor General of Woods, Forests, Parks, and Chases ‚Äì to construct an underground \\"arch\\". This structure is presumed to have been the ice well. Dash has no documented links to the sale of ice or any associated trades such as fish, pastry or ice cream but was a partner in a distillery. Dash's ice was sourced from local ponds and canals but did not prove very popular as it contained foreign bodies. The well had been taken over by William Leftwich by early 1826. Leftwich was a pastry chef, confectioner and caterer who was a pioneer of the ice trade in London. He imported 300 tons of high-quality Norwegian ice to London in 1822 and by 1825 was selling this and ice from local sources (including Regent's Canal) to London and the surrounding countryside. His customers included coffee houses, inns, clubs, fishmongers and pastry chefs; he also sold his own ice-based confectionery. Archaeologists suggest that Leftwich may also have supplied local medical practices and dentists on Harley Street and Wimpole Street, where ice was used to numb the skin prior to operations. Leftwich claimed in an 1828 advertisement to sell the \\"best and clearest\\" ice in London. He had outlets at Fleet Street and in Kingston upon Thames. Leftwich acquired a larger ice well in Regent's Park in 1829 but seems to have retained the Park Crescent well for some time (though it was definitely out of his possession by his death in 1841). Ice houses in general became redundant with the rise of refrigerators in the late 19th century; many were demolished or re-purposed for general storage or as wine cellars.  Rediscovery  Approximate location of an 18th-century ice well behind Park Crescent West, London; the well is marked with a red triangle.The map is superimposed over an OpenStreetMap outtake (issued under CC-BY-SA licence) The well was covered over during the construction of mews on the site in the mid-to-late 19th century and brick walls were laid on top of it. The surrounding houses were destroyed by German bombing during the Blitz but the well was undamaged. It was described as part of the mews property leased for use as a garage as late as 1952 but was lost by 1961 when it was briefly uncovered during construction works before being covered over once more with rubble. The site was being redeveloped in 2014 as part of a ¬£500 million scheme by Great Marlborough Estates, and they commissioned a survey by the Museum of London Archaeology. This uncovered the ice well which was found to be in a good condition. Historic England described the find as \\"a spectacular new discovery, astonishingly well-preserved and demonstrating the great engineering and construction abilities present towards the end of the 18th century\\" and it was noted to be \\"a rare example of a large, well-preserved urban ice-well\\". The structure was listed as a scheduled ancient monument on 28 October 2015. Full excavation of the rubble took three months, though further excavations may allow more of the entrance passageway to be exposed. It was also found that part of the London Underground's Jubilee Line passes beneath the eastern portion of the well. Historic England and the developer have plans to install a corridor above the well that will allow for occasional viewing by the public.

It is native to boreal coniferous and mixed forests in North America, from Nova Scotia to British Columbia and Yukon in Canada, south to New Jersey and Indiana in the United States. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is extirpated (locally extinct) from many of the southern parts of its range. Description Northern wild comfrey is a small, perennial herbaceous plant growing up to tall. The oval-shaped leaves are broader at the base of the plant, growing long and wide with short petioles. The upper leaves clasp the stem. A branching inflorescence is produced at the top of the plant, with several, small, five-petaled blue flowers. The fruit is a bristly nutlet. Taxonomy Northern wild comfrey was originally described as Cynoglossum boreale Fernald in 1905. It has since been treated as a subspecies or variety of Cynoglossum virginianum (now Andersonglossum virginanum), a more southerly species, but re-elevated to species as Andersonglossum boreale. Its first description as A. boreale in 2015 was invalid per the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN, Article 36), as the author had created the new combination but did not personally accept it as a species distinct from A. virginianum: A 2017 study by the same author, with Pedro Jim√©nez-Mej√≠as and Robert F. C. Naczi, compared the morphology of digitized herbarium specimens and confirmed its distinctness from Andersonglossum virginianum, validating the name Andersonglossum boreale. The study found that A. boreale has a shorter calyx length, smaller corolla diameter, and smaller nutlets.

History The New Year's Concert from the Teatro La Fenice of Venice was born as the closing event for the commemorations of the reconstruction of the theater following the arson that destroyed it on the evening of January 29, 1996. The idea came to Anna Elena Averardi, consultant for the care of the image of the Venetian theater and was welcomed by Fabrizio Del Noce, director of Rai 1. Similar to the Vienna New Year's Concert, the January 1 concert in Venice can be collocated in a series of five identical concerts held on December 28 and 29 at 8pm, December 30 at 5pm, on 31 December at 16:00. It starts 11:15 AM, and is broadcast worldwide live from 12.20 by Rai 1. The music critic Pietro Acquafredda collaborated on the formulation of the concert program, from 2004 to 2014, commissioned by Rai 1. The 2011 edition was dedicated to the 150th anniversary of Italian Independence (for the occasion the Italian anthem was played), while the 2013 edition was dedicated, in the opera section of the concert, to the music of Giuseppe Verdi to celebrate the bicentenary of his birth. =Orchestra Directors= Structure The concert program includes the performance of symphonies, symphonic arias and opera pieces. The concert consists of two parts: a first one that presents symphonic pieces or, in any case, only music interpreted by the orchestra, and a second one that focuses mainly on lyric opera pieces, where there are also solo singers and the theater choir. Traditionally it ends with the execution of two non-programmed fixed pieces: the first is the chorus of the Va, Pensiero from Nabucco by Giuseppe Verdi and the second is the famous toast of the Libiamo ne'lieti calici taken from Traviata, always by Verdi. Television broadcasting Only the second part of the concert, that is dedicated to the opera, is broadcast live on Rai 1, and from 2014 on Rai 5 in the evening. The concert is also broadcast in France, Germany, Japan and Latin America. From 2016 the concert has been proposed on ARTE, ZDR, WSR, Radio France and by various radio and television broadcasters from Eastern European countries. The concert is generally broadcast entirely on Rai 5 a month later.

She also had a screen name, Nikol on a television programme before.  Biography  Her father, Andrei Ivanovich Gorbatenko,is an orthopedic surgeon from Rostov-on-Don. Her mother Lyudmila Voevodina, a concert pianist, was also a beauty contestant in the early 1990s following the collapse of the Soviet Union. She attended Plekhanov Russian University of Economics in Moscow. As a beauty pageant contestant, Voevodina won the Miss Moscow title in 2015. Personal life On 22 November 2018, Voevodina married Sultan Muhammad V of Kelantan, who is also the 15th Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King) of Malaysia while he was in Barvikha, Russia. They also already had a traditional Malay wedding in Malaysia on 7 June 2018 prior to the Russian wedding. She had converted to Islam that same year, in April 2018 and changed her name to Rihana Oxana Gorbatenko. While the purported wedding was widely covered and discussed on social media, as of January 2019 no official statement has been released to confirm or deny that matter. In an unprecedented move, Muhammad V became the first King to step down from the throne, effective 6 January 2019 while his term should have ended on 12 December 2021. Media reported the birth of their son Tengku Ismail Leon Petra bin Tengku Muhammad V Faris Petra on 21 May 2019. On 22 June 2019, Muhammad V divorced Voevodina in Singapore by a \\"talak tiga\\" or talaq baayin, the irrevocable divorce executed by simply announcing to his wife that he dissolves the marriage, which is considered to be the most offensive and disapproved type of divorce in Islam. After Voevodina had posted photos of their life together on her Instagram account, the Kelantan palace finally issued official statement on 6 September 2019 rebuking the matter as untrue by condemning postings of the monarch's private life on social media as inappropriate and defamatory. The sultan also expressed 'regret' regarding his personal choices of his private life that has caused the peoples' confusion, without mentioning any names.

Despite having advanced features, a disappointing performance led to its early abandonment. Design and development The 1931, aerodynamically clean NN 1 was an advanced design for its time, with cantilever wings and divided ailerons and unusual in having a triple tail. Its very streamlined forward fuselage was achieved by sacrificing forward vision from the enclosed cockpit. Its high, two part wing, which had an approximately elliptical plan, was built around a single spar and was entirely plywood-covered. Most of the trailing edge carried narrow chord ailerons, each divided into three parts. The NN 1 had a ply-covered, semi- monocoque, pod-and-boom fuselage, though an unusual one. In plan it tapered only gently aft but a side view shows the forward section had a deep, oval profile that blended into a more strongly tapering boom. The open cockpit, fitted with a full complement of blind-flying instruments, was cut out of the forward fuselage without a local change in profile, leaving the pilot with good sideways views but very little forward vision. Landing gear was a skid under the forward fuselage. At the rear a narrow-chord, rectangular tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage and carried elevators of essentially the same plan. Fins were mounted at the ends of the tailplane and carried rudders; a third fin and rudder was mounted centrally, on the fuselage. All these had an overall rectangular profile, with greater chord than height, and projected both above and below the tailplane and fuselage. Its first, ground-towed, flight, piloted by Nowotny, was on 23 October 1931. A few days later the NN 1 was air-towed from Dƒôblin to Warsaw for trials. Perhaps because of directional instabilities, structural issues or poor cockpit visibility, the unexceptional performance led to an early end to the trials.

At the time of the killings, Bunday was serving at the Eielson Air Force Base near Fairbanks, and for a long time avoided suspicion. Despite confessing to the crimes, Bunday was not immediately arrested due to a legal mistake and remained at liberty for another eight days, during which, for unknown reasons, he did not make any effort to evade justice.  Early years  Thomas Bunday was born on September 28, 1948, in Nashville, Tennessee. He was the younger of two children in the family, his elder brother Ralph being 15 years older than him. Bunday spent his childhood and youth in a socially unfavorable situation: his father, a WWII veteran, suffered from mental disorders and was aggressive towards his wife and younger son. After his father died in 1963, Thomas refused to attend his funeral and ran away from home for several days.Tom Brennan. Murder at 40 Below: True Crime Stories from Alaska Bunday was unpopular among the other children at school, but he was a good student, a sociable child who had many friends and acquaintances, which helped develop his positive outlook on life. After graduating from school in 1966, he married his high school sweetheart and in 1967 joined the United States Air Force. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Bunday was serving in Southeast Asia. During this period, his wife gave birth to a son fathered by another man.Tom Brennan. Murder at 40 Below: True Crime Stories from Alaska Despite this, he continued to live with his wife, who later gave birth to a daughter, but an extramarital child strained their relationship. In the mid-1970s, Bunday was sent to further service at Eielson Base, Alaska. During this period, he began to show signs of emotional burnout and began visiting a psychotherapist.Tom Brennan. Murder at 40 Below: True Crime Stories from Alaska  Murders  The murder series began on August 29, 1979, when Fairbanks resident Glinda Sodemann, 19, went missing. Her decomposed body was found two months later in a gravel pit near the highway, 23 miles south of Fairbanks. On June 13, 1980, 11-year-old Doris Oehring went missing. The brother of the deceased told police that a few days before his sister disappeared, he saw her talking to a stranger sitting in a blue car and wearing an Air Force uniform. The brother then helped the investigator make a complete identikit of the criminal. On January 31, 1981, 20-year-old Marlene Peters went missing, who on the day of her disappearance gathered to hitchhike from Fairbanks to Anchorage. Five weeks later, Wendy Wilson, 16, disappeared. On May 16, 1981, 18-year-old Lori King disappeared, and shortly before her disappearance, Marlene Peters' partially decomposed body was found. In October 1981, not far from Wilson's body, the decomposed body of King was found near the Eielson Air Base. During the investigation, the police for the first time suggested that a serial killer from among the military personnel was operating in the territory.  Discovery  During the investigation, the police inspected all personnel of the Eielson Air Base, including the employees employed as civilian specialists. By February 3, 1982, only three people were included in the suspect list, who at various times were distinguished by their destructive behavior towards women, one of them being Bunday. By that time, he had been transferred to Wichita Falls, Texas, where he had served since September 1981. Thomas Bunday was arrested on March 7, 1983, and was taken to the police station to be interrogated. In addition to an interrogation, a search was conducted in his house and the trunk of his car. During the search, evidence was found linking Bunday with the murders in Fairbanks. Upon learning of this, Thomas on the same day sincerely admitted to killing five women and girls and described in detail the murders and the circumstances in which they occurred. He was also questioned about the murder of Cassandra Goodwin on March 22, but vehemently refused to admit to her murder. Bunday indicated psychological problems and sexual complexes as a motive for committing the murders. Despite his confession, he was not arrested and had to be released because there was no warrant for his arrest.  Death  Alaskan authorities issued an arrest warrant for Thomas Bunday on March 15, 1983, but he was not immediately arrested in Texas. Riding his motorcycle about 40 miles outside Wichita Falls, Texas, Bunday drove into the oncoming lane of the highway and collided with a truck. He died almost instantly. The incident was subsequently recognized as a suicide.

Facts A vessel, the Zena, was chartered to carry a perishable cargo of Seville oranges from M√°laga to a marmalade factory in Liverpool. The bill of lading provided that the master was \\"at liberty to visit any ports in any order\\". Although a carrier has a duty to \\"proceed with reasonable despatch\\" M‚ÄôAndrew v Adams (1834) 1 Bing NC 29 and not to deviate from the agreed course, the ship visited other ports in Spain and North Africa before heading for Liverpool. The deviation caused delays in delivering the cargo, during which time both the cargo and the market for oranges had deteriorated. The cargo-owner sued. Judgment The House of Lords held that the \\"liberty clause\\" was in effect an exemption clause which sought to limit the carrier's liability for loss caused through unjustifiable deviation. The court went on to establish the \\"Main Purpose Rule\\" which provided that no exemption rule may cut into the main purpose of the contract.In this case, the main obligation was to carry the perishable cargo of seville oranges to Liverpool with \\"due despatch\\". Accordingly, the carrier was not permitted the protection of the liberty clause and thus was liable for the loss. Lord Herschell LC declared: ‚ÄòWhere general words are used in a printed form which are obviously intended to apply, ...to a particular contract, ... I think you are justified in looking at the main object\\"Main object\\" became the \\"main purpose\\". and intent of the contract and in limiting the general words used, having in view that object and intent.‚Äô Significance Although the liberty clause could not be relied upon to condone major breach, it follows that exemption clauses might be allowed to excuse breaches of peripheral or minor obligations. The Main Purpose Rule was subsequently adopted by the general English contract law in the 1956 case of Karsales v Wallis, recast as the \\"Fundamental Breach\\" doctrine. The Karsales case has since been limited in effect by subsequent decisions and statutes: * The 1967 House of Lords decision of the Suisse Atlantique,Suisse Atlantique Societe d'Armament SA v NV Rotterdamsche Kolen Centrale [1967] 1 AC 361See Harbutt's \\"Plasticine\\" Ltd v Wayne Tank and Pump Co Ltd [1970] 1 QB 447, [1970] 1 All ER 225, [1970] 2 WLR 198, [1970] 1 Lloyds Rep 15, (where the Court of Appeal effectively ignored the Suisse Atlantique). *The Photo Production v Securicor 1980,Photo Production Ltd v Securicor Transport Ltd [1980] UKHL 2 *The Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, and *The Consumer Rights Act 2015.

During the period of 1892 until 1908, she served as president of the Pennsylvania Woman Suffrage Association. Her husband, Rudolph Blankenburg served as mayor of Philadelphia. Together, the Blankenburgs worked for the things that uplifted humanity, that made for cleaner politics, and for better citizenship. During his term, she aided the city in scores of ways, doing some of the routine speech-making for him. She took almost full charge handling his correspondence. Blankenburg was one of the leading club women of the city. She served as vice-president of the National Education Association; president of the Pennsylvania State Suffrage Association, 1892; and first vice-president of the General Federation of Women's Clubs, 1912‚Äì1914. She was a member of the New Century Club, the Working Women's Guild, and the Civic Club. Blankenburg addressed the Pennsylvania General Assembly numerous times. She held four different meetings in the hall of the House of Representatives in behalf of laws for women, and spoke often in both House and Senate. She also spoke at Congress when her organizations had hearings on bills. Early years and education Lucretia Longshore was born May 8, 1845, on a farm near New Lisbon, Ohio, her maternal grandfather, Samuel Myers, having settled here in 1833. Mark Hanna was born on the adjacent farm. She was the only daughter of the Quaker school teacher, Thomas Ellwood Longshore and the physician, Dr. Hannah E. Longshore, of Philadelphia. Dr. Longshore was one of the women pioneers in the medical profession. Blankenburg was named for Lucretia Mott, a pioneer woman suffragist and a Friend; Lucretia Mott was Hannah Longshore's intimate friend. In 1845, Blankenburg, age six-months-old, her parents, and her brother, Channing (born 1842; became a physician), removed to Attleboro, Pennsylvania (now Langhorne, Pennsylvania). Five years later, the family moved to Philadelphia so that Hannah could attend medical school. She was graduated in the first class of the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania. Hannah's sister, Dr. Anna M. Longshore-Potts, graduated in the same class. Blankenburg attended the Friend's Central School in Philadelphia. She was shunned by her playmates, who pelted her with stones and sticks, refusing to admit her to any of their childish sports. They called her \\"The woman doctor's child\\", a term intended to convey as much reproach as that of \\"witch's daughter\\" in New England colonial days. After graduating from this school and the Bryant and Stratton Commercial College, she enrolled in the Woman's Medical College, but later withdrew after deciding that she did not want to pursue the study of medicine. Career Before their wedding, 1867. Mrs. Julia A. Myers, Lucretia's aunt, is on the right. When she was a young girl, a German youth, age 22, Rudolph Blankenburg, came Philadelphia with letters of introduction to her family. At once, he became a welcome visitor. When he had made a start in the new country, on April 18, 1867, Rudolph and Lucretia were married. Three daughters were born to the young couple; but none lived past childhood. After the grief following their death had softened, the Blankenburgs endeavored to fill the vacant place. They adopted a daughter. =Social activist and civic reformer= After the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, 1876, the Blankenburgs began their public work. The exposition had called for assistance from all public-spirited citizens and there seemed much to be done when it ended. The Blankenburg business of manufacturing bedquilts, spreads and yarn was doing well, and its head, unlike the average money-maker, thought he could discern equally important duties elsewhere. Blankenburg began by joining a woman's club. A woman who belonged to a club was a somewhat remarkable person in those days. Women's clubs were few and the majority of those in existence were given over to literary and musical events and to the study of Shakespeare and Browning. A committee of the New Century Club, of which Blankenburg was a member and co-founder, interested themselves in starting night classes in instruction for working women, did not think of regarding their work as a civic movement. Blankenburg chaired the Committee on Education of the New Century Club. The beginning consisted of three or four classes held in the building of the New Century Club. Blankenburg had studied bookkeeping and she became the teacher in that department. She also assisted in planning the cooking class, and for coordinating the financing for the adjunct organization, the New Century Guild, an organization composed of working women, to be fostered and helped by the parent association until it could stand alone. In 1892, she was elected President of the Pennsylvania Woman Suffrage Association, which office she held until 1908. A great deal of Blankenburg's work was done directly in behalf of women. One of her first efforts was to get a representation of women on the Board of Education. She succeeded in having Anna Hallowell elected, and later Mary Mumford, and Philadelphia schools benefited by the work of these two educational experts. In 1895, a committee of the Pennsylvania Woman's Suffrage Association, of which Blankenburg was President, secured a law which provided that a married woman who contributed to the support of her children should have an equal right to the custody and care of the minor children. Before this time, the State of Pennsylvania gave this right to the mother only when the father had been proved a drunkard or worthless or had failed to provide for his family. For years, she workedg for the passage of a law which would protect a childless widow equally with a childless widower. At the time, the law was such that a childless widow inherited one-half the personal estate and the use of one-half the real estate of her deceased husband, while the childless widower got all the personal and the use of all the real estate. Blankenburg was one of the committee of women who inaugurated the system of police matrons in Philadelphia. The committee was a voluntary one; it had no authority and received no compensation. It did have the entree to station houses and it equipped the first matron's department. Through its efforts, four police matrons were appointed as an experiment. The four matrons were greatly assisted by the committee members. They visited the stations frequently, found clothing, homes and jobs for some of the unfortunate women and generally made the innovation so successful that the police matron became a part of the police system. As a member of the Woman's Health Protective Association, Blankenburg ably assisted in \\"pushing along\\" movements to secure trolley fenders, vestibules on trolley cars and sand filtration of water. In 1903, Blankenburg opened an active campaign against the smoke nuisance. Philadelphia had city ordinances and State laws. But Philadelphia continued to be smoky and dirty. Blankenburg organised a committee to try to persuade the offenders to stop. The committee did everything it could up to the point of the defective legislation. It persuaded and coaxed and forced, and Philadelphia began to be cleaner. In her own district, Blankenburg got up a petition, secured the signatures of several hundred householders and sent it to the offending firms. One firm immediately changed its fuel and put in smoke consumers; a second reduced the number of smokestacks. In order to raise money to continue the campaign and to carry it to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania for better laws on the smoke nuisance, Blankenburg sent out a printed notice asking for contributions. In 1904, Blankenburg was a delegate from Philadelphia to the Second Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance held in Berlin, and made an address on the legal condition of women in the United States. Blankenburg was a member of the Good Citizens' Club, as well as a member of the Woman's City Party during its lifetime and she worked hard in this connection. In her own district, she was a member of the Tenth Ward Woman's City Improvement Society, and if the residents of the Tenth Ward were unaware of the vital facts concerning their ward and city it was not because of Blankenburg. Very painstakingly and carefully, she wrote a series of Civic Bulletins labelled: \\"Do You Know the Tenth Ward?\\" \\"City Housekeeping,\\" \\" City Fathers,\\" etc. These bulletins were little primers. They asked every conceivable question about the ward and the city‚Äîhow many voters there are, how many schools, how many churches, what are the methods of city government, the powers vested in the mayor and council. They were in the simplest English and delivered to every householder as a budget of valuable information. =1911 and later= thumb thumb Rudolph Blankenburg was elected mayor of Philadelphia in 1911. He was a leader in all the reform political movements in Philadelphia in his day. Together, the Blankenburgs worked for the things that uplift humanity, that make for cleaner politics, and for better citizenship. From then, the life of the Blankenburgs was busier than ever. She was made a vice-president of the Patrons' Section of the National Education Association and First Vice-President of the General Federation of Women's Clubs. At first, she was deluged with letters asking for positions. When the people found that she had no positions to give, they began asking assistance. Several asked her assistance in selecting wives, and one asked for help in burying a dead cat. There were hundreds of senseless letters, and there were a great many requests for interviews and innumerable telephone calls. Blankenburg believed in women's clubs and in the motto \\"Unity in Diversity.\\" She gave her loyal support to her own city clubs, the Pennsylvania Federation of Women's Clubs, and the General Federation of Women's Clubs since their inception. She held many club offices in Philadelphia and Pennsylvania, and was an honored guest and speaker at many of the local club reunions and banquets. In religion, Blankenburg was a member of the Society of Friends. In 1914, with Marie Jenney Howe of New York City, Blankenburg joined a feminist campaign waged against \\"labelling\\" married women by their husband's names. The movement was for the purpose of permitting married women to retain their maiden name and eliminating the prefix \\"Mrs\\". In this connection she said:‚Äî \\"I am a member of the Society of Friends and the women Friends always have used their own names after marriage. I use my own name. For all business purposes, I am 'Lucretia Longshore Blankenburg'. But for social purposes, if I were sending out invitations, for instance, I might send them out in the name of 'Mrs. Rudolph Blankenburg'.\\" Personal life 50th wedding anniversary, 1917 Despite the years given to public service, the Blankenburg business and the Blankenburg fortune increased. But there was little change in the home. The Quaker touch was plainly seen in its comfortable, unostentatious furnishings. Blankenburg managed her own household affairs, planned her dinners, cooked them herself, and made her own dresses. The household was not troubled by social ambitions. She had been ill with pneumonia for three days before she died March 28, 1937, in her apartment in the Bellevue-Stratford in Philadelphia. She was buried in the city's Fair Hill Burial Ground.

Murder Evelyn Foster was the daughter of a garage proprietor in Otterburn, Northumberland. She worked as a self-employed taxi-driver. A former teacher and a member of a choir, she was popular in her community. Foster was found with serious burns on moorland outside Otterburn on 6 January 1931. She died a few hours after sustaining her injuries. Before she died she described how she had picked up an unknown male passenger at Elishaw, who had asked to be taken to Ponteland. She described how he had knocked her unconscious, thrown a rug over her, and set her on fire. Foster described her attacker as a Tyneside man, about 5ft 6in tall and around 25 or 26 years old. He was clean-shaven and wore a dark tweed suit, a bowler hat and an overcoat. Investigation Police confirmed that they were treating the investigation as a murder case, and that they were searching for a probable \\"sex-maniac\\". A man's scarf and glove were discovered at the scene. The father of Evelyn Foster wrote a letter to the Home Secretary which severely criticised the police investigation. He argued that the car was left unprotected for hours, so that valid fingerprint samples could not be taken, and that police did not check footprints around the scene of the incident. The investigation is still an open case for Northumbria Police. Aftermath The family were devastated by the loss of Evelyn. Her sister later said, \\"We were just young then, but that night made us old. We've turned it over and over in our minds ever since. We were such a close family. The hurt was terrible.\\" Theories and investigations Julian Symons posited that Foster asked innocent questions of her taxi fare that were misinterpreted and resulted in her death. Author Robert Dixon examined Evelyn Foster's death in his 2011 book Evelyn Foster: Murder Or Fraud On The Northumberland Moors. Author Diane Janes was allowed full access to the Northumbria Police archives for the case in 2017. In her book Death at Wolf's Nick: The Killing of Evelyn Foster she names a possible suspect.

He also designed motor scooters in the postwar period. Early life Otto Kauba was born in Vienna on 11 September 1908. Career On the outbreak of World War II Kabua was selling luxury cars and had become friends with Reichsmarschall Hermann G√∂ring, head of the Luftwaffe.. =≈†koda-Kauba= He developed a novel idea for a flying bomb and used his personal friendship with G√∂ring to obtain a joint collaboration with the ≈†koda Works in order to develop his ideas. The ≈†koda-Kauba Flugzeugbau was opened in Prague, Czechoslovakia in 1942.Saffek & Plocek (1992). Although the flying bomb project failed, Kauba went on to produce a number of innovative aircraft and the company built several prototypes, including the SL6 to test the control system for the proposed tailless Blohm & Voss P 208. The SK 257 fighter-trainer incorporated a novel tapered tubular steel wing spar which doubled as an armoured fuel tank. It entered limited production before being cancelled. A later collaboration with Eugen S√§nger produced the P14 design for a ramjet powered fighter. The company ceased to exist when Prague was liberated at the end of the war in 1945.Titz & Zazvonil (1965). =Motor scooters= After the war Kauba returned to his native Austria. From 1949 he designed a new range of motor scooters and mopeds for Lohner. The scooter range included popular models such as the Sissy, L125 and L98, but sales eventually fell due to the increasing popularity of the motor car. The company received the distinction k.u.k. Hofwagenlieferant (\\"Royal carriagemakers\\"). Financed by Hans H. Kosteletzky, he then started the Kosty company and in 1952 launched the Kosty 100 scooter, powered by a Rotax two-stroke engine. The motor was set inside a cage and the drive chain tension was set by sliding the whole engine back and forth. However sales were poor, it has been suggested because the price was too high, and the company closed the next year.Kosty (A), Fahrzeug-Archiv, GT√ú Classic. (In German) (Retrieved 23 July 2019) He next formed a company in Vienna under his own name and began building the Lux, developed from the Kosty using Rotax 98cc and 125cc engines.Lux, Virtuelles Kraftfahrzeug Museum Austria (VKMA), (Virtual Motor Museum Austria). (In German) (retrieved 22 Julky 2019) Some 400 units in total were produced between 1953 and 1956. He was supported in this by Ragnar Math√©y of the Megu company, which had also been involved with both Lohner and Kosty. The Lux 98 was developed into the Bobby.Sheldon's EMU; Lux Motor Scooters. =OFW= Kauba now turned back to aircraft. He designed the OK-15 two-seat light aircraft for the √ñsterreichische Flugzeugwerke GmbH (OFW) at Wiener Neustadt. In 1956 it became the first aircraft to be designed and built in Austria for twenty years.\\"Did You Know...?\\", Air Pictorial, Vol. XVIII, No. 8, August 1956, p.285.Gunston, Bill; World Encyclopedia of Aircraft Manufacturers, 2nd ed, Sutton (2005), p.345.

It was established in 1886 in Rishon LeZion and is still active to this day.  History  Ever since the establishment of Rishon LeZion the question of education for the children of the village was raised. In 1882, when the village was established, Aharon Mordehai Freiman invited a Melamed from Hebron named Rappaport Tuvia Haim in which he taught the boys of the village in a tent in his yard. He taught Torah, Mishnah and Talmud while they were sitting on the floor around a low table. Later their place of study was moved to the basements of the founders of the village Shraga Fayvel and Dov Fishelzon, Math. The French language was also added to the curriculum. In 1886, the population of Rishon LeZion was about 300, of which several dozen were children who needed proper education, so the establishment of a modern school was proposed. However, this was difficult due to the lack of experienced teachers, the lack of textbooks in Hebrew and mixed gender education which was not yet accepted. The school was established in the center of Rishon LeZion near the great synagogue for girls only. The boys studied in the basement of the synagogue. The school had no name and was simply known as \\"The school\\". Mordechai Lubman was appointed the school's first principal by the baron's clerks. Many teachers of the time wrote textbooks themselves due to the lack of textbooks in Hebrew. The teachers had to create new words in Hebrew for tools and terms that did not exist at the time of the Bible. The \\"reviver of the Hebrew language\\" Eliezer Ben-Yehuda was a teacher in the school and wrote textbooks as well. Because the school taught exclusively in Hebrew, it is considered the world's first school to teach in Hebrew. In 1901, the principal Israel Belkind decided to allow the school to teach both boys and girls. In 1951, the school was named \\"Haviv School\\", named after Dov Lubman Haviv, who was the former chairman of the local council of Rishon LeZion.

It is known only from the Western Central Pacific Ocean, in the southern South China Sea. Only three specimens of this species are known, found in Borneo, Vietnam, and Thailand, all of which are over 80 years old. The specimens were originally tentatively assigned as belonging to the smalltail shark (C. porosus), but a number of subtle morphometric differences revealed that they belonged to a new Carcharinus species, referred to as Carcharinus sp. A. It differs from other Carcharinus species by the relative position of the second dorsal and anal fins, as well as its low vertebral count. As no individuals have been identified for over 80 years, C. obsolerus may be extinct. Like other members of the C. porosus subgroup, C. obsolerus likely had limited fecundity and lived in shallow waters that are easily accessed by fishermen, both of which put it at heavy risk of extinction from overfishing. However, the rediscovery of the Borneo shark (C. borneensis) in 2004 after a long period of no sightings has kept hopes for its possible survival.

The case also addresses bills of lading, and the parol evidence rule. Facts A vessel was to carry a cargo of rape seed from Fiume (now Rijeka) to Dunkirk, the itinerary made explicit in the bill of lading. Before reaching Dunkirk, the master deviated to Scotland where the ship sank in a storm off the mouth of the River Clyde. When the cargo-owner (the indorsee of the bill of lading) sued, the shipowners sought to rely on the perils of the sea exception in the bill. When it was pointed out that deviation annuls such protection, the shipowners contended that the deviation was justified since the shippers were aware at the time of shipment of the intention to call at Glasgow (a fact which the shipper acknowledged). The shipowners also argued that the ship would inevitably have been lost anyway, as there were storm conditions off Dunkirk as well as in the Firth of Clyde. Judgment The Court of Appeal applied the parol evidence rule (which provides that \\"extrinsic evidence is inadmissible to vary a written contract\\") and held that the bill was conclusive evidence of the terms of the contract. It followed that the shipper's awareness of the route was inadmissible, as a bill of lading in the hands of the indorsee should be absolutely reliable. Therefore, the deviation was not justifiable and the shipowner, who was denied the protection of \\"perils of the sea\\", was liable to the cargo-owner. The secondary argument that a sinking was inevitable because of the ubiquity of the storm was dismissed out of hand as hypothetical. Significance The case shows that deviation is deemed to be a very serious breach of a contract of carriage, and if (as here) the deviation is unjustifiable, exemption clauses will not be permitted to protect the carrier from liability. Five years later, the case of Glynn v Margetson took a similar view, and these strict rules on deviation remain as valid as ever, although the law on deviation was diluted by Art IV Rule 4 of the Hague-Visby Rules. Hague-Visby rules, Art IV rule 4: \\"Any deviation in saving or attempting to save life or property at sea or any reasonable deviation shall not be deemed to be an infringement or breach of these Rules or of the contract of carriage, and the carrier shall not be liable for any loss or damage resulting therefrom.\\".

It is a cosmopolitan species that is found in most seas in the Northern Hemisphere including the Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean. Description This worm lives in an irregularly coiled, smooth, calcareous tube that it secretes and which is attached to the substrate along most of its length. The opening of the tube is protected by a funnel-shaped operculum which has about 160 tiny creases along its rim. Inside the tube, the worm is yellowish and up to long. It has about forty radioles (featherlike structures forming a crown) which can be extended through the open end of the tube. The operculum is usually red and the radioles are red, pink or orange and usually banded with white. The radioles are attached to the peristomium, which bears a pair of eyes, and the worm has seven thoracic segments and up to 190 abdominal segments. Distribution and habitat Serpula columbiana has a cosmopolitan distribution in the Northern Hemisphere being present in the Indian Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. In the Pacific Ocean its range extends from the Bering Strait to Japan and from Alaska to Baja California. It is found on hard substrates such as rocks, wharves, pilings and floats, from the intertidal zone down to depths of around . Ecology This worm is a filter feeder and extends its radioles into the water to catch planktonic food particles. If danger threatens, the radioles can be retracted rapidly and the operculum closed to seal the tube. The worm's heart pumps blood into the radioles which also act as gills. The haemal system consists of a single branchial vessel in each radiole into which blood flows; there is no circulation and the blood flows alternately in and out in a tidal manner. In the blood, oxygen is carried by the pigment chlorocruorin. This pigment has a particular affinity for carbon monoxide, and it has been noted that the worm's larvae sometimes settle and grow on such brown seaweeds as Fucus but do not do so on Nereocystis; the suggested explanation for this is that Nereocystis uses carbon monoxide to inflate its pneumatocyst (float chambers) and that would likely make the seaweed toxic to the worm.

He also worked on elasticity theory, which is used in applied math and physics. He was Corresponding Member of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR, Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences (1953), Head of the Department of Computational Mathematics of the Kyiv Cybernetics Faculty University (1958). Education In 1933, Polozii graduated from high school in the village of Verkhnyi Baskunchaky of Astrakhan Oblast, and subsequently entered the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics of Saratov University. He graduated from Saratov University in 1937 and stayed to teach until he moved to the University of Kiev in 1949. Later life After 1938, Polozii worked at the Department of Mathematical Analysis. He participated in the Soviet-Finnish war. During the German-Soviet war in one of the battles near Nelidovo as infantry platoon commander he was seriously wounded. He had seven operations then he returned to Saratov University where he was engaged in scientific and pedagogical work. In 1946 he defended his Ph.D. thesis \\"Integral images of continuously differentiable functions of a complex variable\\". In 1949, he began working at the University of Kyiv, first as an associate professor of the Department of Mathematical Physics, and from 1951 to 1958 ‚Äì its head. In 1953 he defended his doctoral dissertation on the topic \\"On some methods of the theory of functions in the mechanics of a continuous medium\\". In 1958 Georgiy Polozhia was elected head of the Department of Computational Mathematics. He died on September 26, 1968, less than a year before realizing his dream of creating a separate faculty for computational mathematics and cybernetics. He is buried in Kiev at Baykovoye Cemetery. Works Polozii mostly worked in the following four areas. = Complex functions = He produced \\"original results in the theory of functions of a complex variable\\" A complex function is a function whose domain and range are subsets of the complex plane. For any complex function, the values z from the domain and their images f(z) in the range may be separated into real and imaginary parts: : z=x+iy \\\\quad \\\\text{ and } \\\\quad f(z) = f(x+iy)=u(x,y)+iv(x,y), where x,y,u(x,y),v(x,y) are all real-valued. In other words, a complex function f:\\\\mathbb{C}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{C} may be decomposed into : u:\\\\mathbb{R}^2\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R} \\\\quad \\\\text{ and } \\\\quad v:\\\\mathbb{R}^2\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}, i.e., into two real-valued functions (u, v) of two real variables (x,y). The basic concepts of complex analysis are often introduced by extending the elementary real functions (e.g., exponential functions, logarithmic functions, and trigonometric functions) into a complex domain and the corresponding complex range. =Approximation theory= He developed methods to solve boundary value problems which arise in mathematical physics. His work produced the method of summary representation. He \\"devised a new approximation method for the solution of problems in elasticity and filtration\\". Approximation theory tries to develop simpler functions to mimic or get close to more complex ones and define the errors that can be introduced by these approximations. = Numerical analysis= Polozii came up with a new class of (p,q) analytic functions and developed a new notion of p-analytic functions, defined the notion of derivative and integral for these functions, developed their calculus and obtained a generalised Cauchy's formula\\". =Theory of elasticity= References Category:1914 births Category:1968 deaths Category:20th-century Russian mathematicians ","title":"Georgii Polozii"},{"id":"59593391","text":"Castel Goffredo Town Hall (also called Palazzo della Ragione) and Loggia della Magnifica Comunit√† are located in Piazza Mazzini in Castel Goffredo, in the Province of Mantua (Italy). It is the seat of the municipality.  History  The ancient communal building (domus Comunis) (or Palazzo del Vicario) was placed on the right side of the civic tower in the ancient \\"Piazza del Ponte dell'Olmo\\"; appears to have been present since 1337, when Castel Goffredo, with a public act by the notary Giacomino Gandolfi, placed himself under the protection of Ludovico I Gonzaga, the first capitano del popolo of Mantua.Costante Berselli, Castelgoffredo nella storia, 1978. Mantova. This building was ceded in 1480, passing into property to Ludovico Gonzaga (1460-1511), bishop of Mantua and marquis of Castel Goffredo,Francesco Bonfiglio, Notizie storiche di Castelgoffredo, 2005, Mantova. who intended to make it his residence. It is therefore possible to hypothesize that the current structure was built after the aforementioned sale. Every year the general neighborhood was gathered in the house which, composed of all the heads of the family, appointed the Council to take care of public service assignments. [3] Coat of arms of the municipality  Description  The oldest, main facade overlooking piazza Mazzini is in neoclassical style. On the ground floor there is the \\"Loggia delle grida\\" or \\"Loggia della Magnifica Comunit√†\\" where the neighborhood was located. A commemorative plaque on the right of the entrance recalls the battle of Solferino on June 24, 1859 and the French marshal Fran√ßois Certain de Canrobert. On the first floor there are four windows with a central balcony. The council hall, with a frescoed ceiling (1850) recently restored, in the nineteenth century housed the municipal theater of the city. Inside, in modern style, there is an iron sculpture by the Mantuan sculptor Ferruccio Bolognesi (1924-2002) representing the characters of the Virgil's Aeneid which, according to some scholars, was born in the territory of Castel Goffredo.

It prevented Ramfis Trujillo, Jos√© Arismendy Trujillo and H√©ctor Bienvenido Trujillo Molina from returning to power and restoring the regime led by their brother Rafael Trujillo. The timely rebellion marked the end of one of the bloodiest dictatorships of the twentieth century and the beginning of democracy in the Dominican Republic, preventing the elimination of the political class that opposed the Trujillo regime.  Assassination of dictator Rafael Leonidas Trujillo  The persecution, reprisals and torture to which the Dominican people were subjected for 31 years began their end when the night of May 30, 1961, Juan Tom√°s D√≠az, his brother Modesto D√≠az, Antonio de la Maza, Antonio Imbert Barrera, Salvador Estrella Sadhal√°, Amado Garc√≠a Guerrero, Hu√°scar Tejeda, Pedro Livio Cede√±o, Luis Amiama Tio, Luis Manuel C√°ceres Michel and Roberto Pastoriza Neret executed the dictator Rafael Le√≥nidas Trujillo . With the execution of the dictator began the decapitation of Trujillo dictatorship. However, the machinery that supported the dictatorship remained almost intact, so democracy took time to build. The Dominican Republic suffered for 5 months and 19 days, the cruelest barbarism suffered during the 30 years and months that the Trujillo dictatorship lasted, increasing the crimes, torture, abuse, cancellations and dispossession of property to the Dominicans. Out of Trujillo's group of executors only General Imbert Barrera and Luis Amiama Tio survived; the others were 9 killed by Ramfis Trujillo, the son of the tyrant, and the remnants of the regime. On November 18, 1961 Ramfis Trujillo had murdered six of the executors in the Hacienda Mar√≠a Massacre in San Cristobal.  The Rebellion of the Pilots- November 19th, 1961  The uprising of the Rebellion of the Pilots took place on the morning of November 19, 1961. The artillery and the tank squadrons of the San Isidro Air Base were bombed, as well as other military installations that remained loyal to Trujillo such as the Mao and Puerto Plata fortresses. These attacks succeeded in disabling the military forces that supported the Trujillo and achieved the definitive exit of the country from the Trujillo remnants of the country.. This act prevented Pet√°n, Negro and Ramfis Trujillo from executing a plot to dethrone Joaqu√≠n Balaguer from the Presidency of the Republic and assassinate the main leaders of the National Civic Union and the 14th of June Movement. On the night of November 18 Pet√°n Trujillo, the Air Force chief, had met at the San Isidro Air Base with Tunti S√°nchez, and the regional chiefs of the dreaded Military Intelligence Service (SIM), including Alicinio Pe√±a Rivera, who would kill the politicians and antitrujillistas of the Cibao region. This plan was called Operation Green Light or the Massacre of San Bartolom√© whose objective was serial murders of leaders like Viriato Fiallo, Joaquin Balaguer, among others. The Rebellion of the Pillots was devised and executed by Lieutenant Colonels Manuel Dur√°n Guzm√°n, ideologue of the plot, Raymundo Polanco Alegr√≠a, commander of the Ramfis Hunting Squadron, and Nelton Gonz√°lez Pomares. It was led by General Pedro Rodr√≠guez Echavarria, at that time commander of the Santiago air base and the superior officers Pedro Santiago Rodr√≠guez Echavarr√≠a and Federico Fern√°ndez Smester.  Members of the plot  Manuel Dur√°n Guzm√°n was born on September 28, 1924 in Villa Riva. He studied at the Padre Fantino Jesuit seminary in Santo Cerro as a young man, then ventured into a military career in 1945. He was the ideological leader and originator of the conspiracy. His plan was to carry it out in the months following Rafael Trujillo's death but he could not do so due to the high risk in those early days of being denounced and arrested. Raymundo Polanco Alegr√≠a was Dur√°n Guzm√°n's first contact. A member of Dur√°n Guzm√°n's graduating class in 1948, Polanco-Alegr√≠a, of Almerian descent, was commander of the Ramfis Hunt Squadron and had under his command sixty aircraft of all types during the golden age of the Dominican Military Aviation. He was one of the great aces of the Dominican Military Aviation. After the November 19 plot, he retired from military aviation and was designated as a military attach√© in Europe. Nelton Gonz√°lez Pomares was another of Dur√°n Guzm√°n's first contacts. He was the commander of the Hunting and Bombing Group. After the uprising, he was appointed as a military attache to Washington and later was Director of Dominicana de Aviacion. Pedro Rafael Rodr√≠guez Echavarr√≠a, brigadier general and commander of the Santiago Air Base, was convinced by Dur√°n Guzm√°n to lead the plot due to the quality of his leadership, his prestige and his good relationships with other political and military leaders. He supported Balaguer in the creation of the first State Council. It is said that at the request of President John F. Kennedy, he was appointed on November 22 Secretary of State of the Armed Forces and his brother Pedro Santiago Rodr√≠guez Echavarr√≠a as Chief of Staff of the Dominican Air Force.

It is one of the major diagnostic methods in Chinese Medicine since the time of the Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic. It is considered a part of the ‚ÄúInspection‚Äù method within the four methods of diagnosis. The tongue provides important clues reflecting the conditions of the internal organs. Like other diagnostic methods, tongue diagnosis is based on the ‚Äúouter reflects the inner‚Äù principle of Chinese medicine, which is that external structures often reflect the conditions of the internal structures and can give us important indications of internal disharmony. Common tongue syndromes  Topography of the Tongue  The tongue is divided into topographic regions corresponding to the Triple Burner and Zang Fu organs. By observing the various regions of the tongue, one can determine where the disease is located within the body. One method of mapping the tongue is by dividing it into three sections to correspond to the Triple Burner. The tip of the tongue corresponds to the Upper Burner (Heart, Lungs); the middle corresponds to the Middle Burner (Stomach, Spleen), and the base of the tongue corresponds to the Lower Burner (Kidneys, Bladder, Intestines). Another method is to map the tongue by Zang Fu organs. The tip of the tongue corresponds with the Heart, the region at the front of the tongue between the tip and the center corresponds to the Lung, the center corresponds with Stomach and Spleen, the right side corresponds to the Gallbladder, the left side corresponds to the Liver, and the base of the tongue corresponds to Kidney, Bladder, Large Intestine, and Small Intestine. The mapping of organs to areas of the tongue in Chinese Medicine hold correlation with mapping of the reflex zones of the tongue in ancient Greek medicine.  Aspects of the Tongue  The aspects of the tongue considered in diagnosis include: *Tongue spirit or vitality *Body color *Body shape *Tongue coating *Tongue moisture In addition, various features are also considered, including absence or presence of and the characteristics of movement, bristles, cracks, and teethmarks.  Normal tongue  A normal, healthy tongue is pale red or pink with a thin white coating. The tongue should have spirit, but it should not tremble or quiver. It should have a shape which is not too swollen or flabby, with no cracks, and be slightly moist.  Significance of the Tongue in Diagnosis  When differentiating between various patterns in clinical settings, tongue diagnosis plays a significant role. In a situation in which a patient has complex or even conflicting clinical presentations, the tongue body color nearly always reflects the true underlying condition. For example, a patient may present with various localized signs of Heat, however, the tongue may reflect an underlying condition of Cold from Yang deficiency. In this case it is important to consider the underlying condition in the treatment principle.  Scientific evaluation  A 2008 study found that interpractitioner and intrapractitioner reliability levels were low. The features of the tongue are claimed to be tied to specific body parts, but evidence is lacking.

He is Professor of Civil & Environmental Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the Faculty Director of the Concrete Sustainability Hub (CSHub@MIT). He is credited for discovering the nanogranular structure of Calcium-Silicate-Hydrates (C-S-H), the binding phase of concrete, and for the development of concepts of nanoengineering of concrete which combine advanced nanomechanics experiments with molecular simulation results. He speaks up for an environmental sustainable engineering, with ‚Äúgreener‚Äù concrete with lower footprint, to reduce the carbon footprint of concrete; to enhance concrete's resilience; and reduce its impact on global warming.  Early career  Ulm grew up in F√ºrth/Bavaria and Erlangen as son of Udo Ulm and Hertha Ulm, both Structural Engineers. Following National Service as a nurse in a surgical hospital in Erlangen, he studied Civil Engineering at the Technical University of Munich, where he graduated in 1990 with a ‚ÄúDiplom Ingenieur (Bauingenieur)‚Äù(Eq. MSc) degree. Prior to concluding his studies in Munich, he was sent to the Ecole National des Ponts et Chaussee as an exchange student, and completed his Diplomarbeit (Master's Thesis) at the (LCPC) in Paris (now IFSTTAR), the Central French Civil Engineering Laboratory. He continued his studies at Ecole National des Ponts et Chaussees, as a research assistance at LCPC, receiving a Docteur-Ingenieur degree (eq. Ph.D.) from ENPC in January 1994, with a specialization in Materials and Structures. During this time, he worked closely with Olivier Coussy on the English translation of Coussy's book ‚ÄúMechanics of Porous Continua‚Äù. The collaboration of Ulm with Coussy led to the development of the Continuum Chemomechanics theory which has been applied by Ulm and co-workers to Early‚ÄìAge Concrete and risk evalDiuation of concrete cracking relevant for massive concrete structures in innovative bridge and tunneling applications; to prediction of premature deterioration of concrete structures due to the Alkali-Silica Reactions; and the deleterious effects of calcium leaching of concrete relevant for nuclear waste storage applications. In 1996, he became Charg√© de Recherche (Research Scientist) of the French Ministry of Public Works. During his tenure at LCPC, he was head of the Research group of concrete and concrete composite behavior and modeling. In 1998, he obtained the habilitation degree from the Ecole Normal Superieur de Cachan with a habilitation thesis on chemomechanics of concrete materials and structures.  Academic career  Ulm joined MIT in January 1999, where he specialized in experimental nano- and micromechanics of cement-based materials, shales and bones. With his research group, he developed statistical nanoindentation techniques for hydrated nanocomposites; an indentation technique that permits via statistical analysis to link chemistry and mechanical behavior at 10s of nanometer length scales. In 2007, his group discovered that cementitious materials at nanoscale exhibit a nanogranular behavior driven by particle-to- particle contact forces. This nanogranular origin was found to drive much of the strength and durability performance of cementitious materials, such as the long-term creep behavior and fire resistance. A similar nanogranular nature was found for shales and bones. In 2008, he joined forces with a group of physicists and computational material scientists to combine experimental nanoindentation investigations with molecular and meso-scale simulations of cement hydrates. Specifically, the collaboration with Roland Pellenq, a CNRS Research Director and Senior Research Scientist at MIT, allowed identification of the molecular structure of calcium-silicate hydrates, the binding phase of concrete which lends its strength and durability to concrete at engineering scales. By incorporating concepts of glass physics and soft matter physics into cement science, Ulm and co-workers showed by means of a molecular combinatorial approach that concrete's fundamental strength could be elevated without changing the chemistry of its constituents, i.e. Calcium, Silica and Water. The handshake of molecular simulation techniques with experimental nanoscale experiments opened a novel way to address the concrete sustainability challenge to reduce the environmental impact while sustaining its role as the backbone material for housing, shelter and infrastructure worldwide. The challenge led, in 2009, to the foundation of the Concrete Sustainability Hub at MIT (CSHub@MIT). This novel industry‚Äìacademia partnership between the Portland Cement Association (Skokie, Illinois), the National Ready Mixed Concrete Association (Silver Spring, Maryland) and MIT aims at reducing the environmental footprint of concrete, while enhancing its resilience from materials to structures and urban community scale.

Several attempts to build such an engine have been made by different engineers and manufacturers in the 1960s and 1970s. Due to technical problems and the general disadvantages of the Wankel design, the Wankel Diesel engine never left the prototype stage, and designing a Wankel Diesel engine capable of running under its own power is thus considered unfeasible.  Design concept  Rolls-Royce 2-R6 prototype, shaped like the 8-digit. Rolls- Royce R1C prototype. A Wankel Diesel engine shares its basic design, a triangular-like rotor in an oval, epitrochoid-shaped housing, with a regular Wankel engine. The key difference is that it shares all of its operational characteristics with a Diesel engine. In addition to this, supercharging is required: A regular Diesel engine achieves compression ignition by a high compression ratio, which cannot be done in a Wankel engine due to the shape of the Wankel combustion chamber; supercharging ‚Ä≥artificially‚Ä≥ increases the compression ratio to ensure that compression ignition takes place. There exist several different approaches of designing a supercharger for a Wankel Diesel engine. Wankel designed an external supercharger, whereas Rolls-Royce added a secondary supercharging rotor of a bigger size, making the engine a two-stage rotary, which gave the housing an eight-like appearance.  Reasons for designing a Wankel Diesel engine  Compared with a Diesel engine, a regular petrol engine has a lower thermal efficiency. However, in the 1960s, the petrol engine advantages of lower mass, fewer vibrations and less noise emissions, all of which are important for passenger cars, were still prevailing. Low mass and smooth engine operation are also characteristics of the Wankel engine ‚Äì combining Wankel design with Diesel characteristics would result in an efficient engine with low mass and few vibrations. Making a Wankel engine that can burn Diesel engine fuel, but which does not use the Diesel principle, can be useful if Diesel engine fuel is less expensive than petrol. In a 1974 study conducted for the EPA, it was attempted to determine whether or not a Wankel Diesel engine has a better exhaust behaviour than a regular Otto cycle petrol engine.  Causes of infeasibility  The main cause of Wankel Diesel engine infeasibility is the shape of the combustion chamber, located in the rotary piston: It is elongated and convex, thus not allowing a high enough compression ratio (without too much heat loss), even in combination with a (solely crankshaft or exhaust gas driven) supercharger. This means that the engine is only functional if it is fed externally compressed air, as it requires more work to operate than it can produce. Also, designing a proper combustion chamber, correctly angled towards the injection nozzle to allow proper mixture formation, proved to be quite difficult; the EPA study proves that the Wankel Diesel engine's exhaust contains disproportionally high levels of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons (HC), indicating incomplete combustion.  Prototype development  = Diesel-Ring = The Diesel-Ring was a joint venture of the German Diesel engine manufacturers Daimler-Benz, MAN, Krupp and KHD. Development was ceased in 1969, because the shape of the Wankel engine combustion chamber was considered ineligible for the Diesel principle. = Rolls-Royce = Rolls-Royce began developing a lightweight military Wankel Diesel engine for the MoD in 1964. Fritz Feller was the leading engineer of the project. Soon, it became obvious that a regular Wankel engine would not be suitable for the high compression ratio needed for compression ignition, which led to the idea of using another rotary piston as a supercharger. Early tests were conducted with a modified NSU Wankel engine, that was fed pre-heated compressed air to achieve compression ignition. This test engine displaced 0.25 litre and ran for 94 hours before it broke; the fuel consumption ranged from 0.84 lb/hp¬∑h to 1.4 lb/hp¬∑h (511 g/kW¬∑h to 852 g/kW¬∑h). The sealing material proved to be insufficient, leading to high sealing loss; new materials had to be engineered. Furthermore, designing a good combustion chamber, allowing good mixture of air and fuel, turned out to be considerably diffult and thus required a lot of development work. To avoid the problem of having a complicated combustion chamber in the rotor, a precombustion chamber was considered an option, but it was later abandoned, because making a housing with a proper precombustion chamber seemed unfeasible. The first prototype, made of an NSU KKM 502 Wankel engine, was called R1 and featured a two stage design with two rotors and an 8-shaped housing. It had a compression chamber volume of 1.126 litre and borrowed its 0.5 litre combustion chamber displacement from the KKM 502. In total, eight different evolutions of the R1 were made, named in alphabetical order, (R1A, R1B, R1C,...). The fifth evolution, which as called R1E, had an increased 1.265 litre compression chamber, but it retained the 0.5 litre combustion chamber. Its power output was about 40 kW; fuel consumption was approximately 220 g/kW¬∑h. The prototype R2 had a 3-rotor design; R3 was the first version of a powerplant with a greater displacement, capable of developing more power. The first prototypes having the planned engine size, were called the R4 and R5. In the R5, the first rotor stage was only used for compressing the intake air, the exhaust gas was not used to power it. Instead, the exhaust gas was sent through an external exhaust gas turbine. In early 1970, the prototype 2-R6 was completed. It is also a two-stage rotary engine, with the smaller combustion rotor on top of the bigger compression rotor. The rotors are connected with a gear ratio of 1 : 1 and rotate in the same direction. Unlike the R5 prototype, the 2-R6 uses the exhaust gas energy with its compression rotor instead of an external exhaust gas turbine. Torque is not taken off the combustion rotor, but the compression rotor instead. The engine has a displacement of 396 in3 (6.5 litre) and was supposed to have a power output of 350 hp (261 kW), but having a mass of only 929 lb (421 kg). At the time, this would have been 50 % of the mass of a comparable piston Diesel engine with the same power output. Further plans included a more powerful 700 hp (522 kW) version of the engine in addition to the regular 350 hp variant. However, despite using special alloys, the engine mass was 1150 lb (522 kg) and the power output of 180 hp (134 kW) barely exceeded 50 % of the projected 350 hp. All runs on the test bed required using externally produced compressed air, the engine did never run under its own power. It is said that due to financial problems, the Wankel Diesel engine project was cancelled in 1974. It was conjectured, that the Yom Kippur War made the British Military lose the interest in a compact tank powerplant, resulting in governmental subsidies to get cut. It is much more likely though, that designing a working Wankel Diesel engine is simply not possible. = Felix Wankel = Wankel designed a Wankel Diesel engine with two clover-shaped housings and a compressor in between. Unlike in a regular Wankel engine, the rotary pistons are not shaped like a Reuleaux triangle, but like a bulgy quadrate. The compressor rotor has the shape of an ellipse. Despite the unusual design, this engine was functional under test conditions on a test bed. A second prototype with just one rotor for testing purposes was made. It had a displacement of 0.7 litre and passed a 20-hour test run where it produced a peak torque of 60 N¬∑m.

It was built in 1883. In 1899, it was destroyed by fire and rebuilt over two years. The rear of the building overlooks the Northeast Harbor inlet, which opens out to the Atlantic Ocean. The inn has been owned by the Asti-Kim Corporation since 1965 and, between 2015 and 2019, was managed by the Acadia Corporation.\\"Acadia Corp to manage Asticou Inn\\" - MDI Islander, January 5, 2015 There are 48 guest rooms: 31 in the main inn, plus 17 in six adjacent buildings: Cranberry Lodge, Blue Spruce, Bird Bank, and three \\"Topsiders\\". The inn closes for the seven months between Columbus Day (late October) and Memorial Day (late May). History Augustus Chase (\\"A.C.\\") Savage (1832‚Äì1911) lived with his wife, Emily Manchester (1834‚Äì1914), in the 1854-built Harbor Cottage (now Cranberry Lodge), which sits near the apex of the corner of Peabody Drive (almost directly across from both Blue Spruce and Bird Bank, which are the other two \\"Asticou Cottages\\" that are part of the inn).Asticou Inn - History Savage correctly predicted that an overflow of vacationers to Bar Harbor would greatly benefit Northeast Harbor. In 1883, across the road from Harbor Cottage, he built the Asticou Inn. (The name Asticou comes from a Penobscot Indian word believed to mean boiling kettle.) The original building was destroyed by a fire 16 years after opening. It was rebuilt by A.C. and his son, George (1873‚Äì1922). A.C.'s other son, Frederick Lincoln Savage (1861‚Äì1924), was the architect.Fred Savage, The Cottage Builder - Jaylene B. Roths It reopened in 1901. The inn was spared during the great fires of 1947. The combined Savage families took active parts in the day-to-day management of the business, with the women establishing the inn's reputation for hearty New England food and the children picking berries that contributed to desserts and pies. George Savage died in 1922, aged about 48. His 19-year-old son, Charles Kenneth Savage (1903‚Äì1979), was brought back from his boarding school in Boston, Massachusetts, to help his mother, Mabelle (1877‚Äì1965), maintain the inn's tradition. When Charles married, his wife, Katharine Larcher Savage (1905‚Äì2001),\\"Charles K. Savage and family, Northeast Harbor, ca. 1946\\" - MaineMemory.net became the manager of the inn's kitchen, and her pastries, breads, ice creams and desserts proved very popular. Charles and Katharine ran the inn until 1964. They had a daughter and a son. In 1956, Savage created the Asticou Azalea Garden across the street from the inn. Some members of the Savage family were initially interred in a family cemetery around where the cottages Blue Spruce and Bird Bank stand today. They were moved to Forest Hill Cemetery, on the other side of the azalea garden, which was created by A.C. Savage in 1904.\\"Mount Desert Island: Shaped by Nature\\" - Early Settlement Frederick Savage, meanwhile, is buried in Ledgelawn Cemetery on Cromwell Harbor Road, along with his wife of 23 years, Alice (1879‚Äì1961), who survived him by 37 years.

He worked on general properties of motion in the n-body problem. Biography and education Subbotin was born on 29 June 1893 in Ostrolenka, Russian Empire (now Ostro≈Çƒôka, Poland). Mikhail Fedorovich Subbotin studied in the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics at the University of Warwaw in 1910 and graduated in 1914. He had an interest also in astronomy and worked as a calculator at the university observatory. After graduating he continued on as a junior astronomer. His father was an army officer, Fedor Subbotin. After the German army invaded Poland, the University of Warsaw was evacuated to Rostov-on-Don in 1915. Subbotin completed his master's degree there in 1917. During this time he published two papers, ‚ÄúOn the determination of singular points of analytic functions‚Äù and another on singular points of certain differential equations. He then moved to the Donskoy Polytechnic Institute (Novocherkassk) where he ultimately was appointed a professor of mathematics. In 1922, he accepted an offer to go work at the Central Astronomical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences as Director in Tashkent. Before the outbreak of World War II he worked at various astronomical institutions in Leningrad (Saint Petersburg). Subbotin stayed in Leningrad and almost starved to death during the siege by the Germans and was finally evacuated in February 1942 to Sverdlovsk to recover. Near the end of 1942 Subbotin became the Director of the Leningrad Astronomical Institute, relocated to Saratov before it was finally brought back to Leningrad after the German withdrawal. He received the Order of the Red Banner of Labor (06/10/1945). In 1963 he was awarded the Order of Lenin. Subbotin died on 26 December 1966 in then Leningrad, USSR (now Saint Petersburg, Russia). A memorial plaque was installed at his house at Moskovsky Prospect 206 in 1971 (architect V. V. Isaeva) Works He started his career working on the theory of functions and probability. He worked on the creation of a catalog of faint stars. As he moved more to astronomy he concentrated on celestial mechanics to devise new methods to calculate orbits from three observations based on solving the Euler‚ÄìLambert equations. ‚Äú... Subbotin not only showed the possibility of improving the convergence of the trigonometric series by which the behaviour of perturbing forces is represented, but also gave an expression for determining Laplace coefficients and presented formulas for computing the coefficients of the necessary members of the trigonometric series.‚Äù Subbotin wrote a three-volume work called ‚ÄúCourse in Celestial Mechanics\\" (1933‚Äì49), in which for the first time in Russian the main questions of celestial mechanics were described in detail.

For 16 years, from 1816 to 1832 (longer than anyone else), he served as Marshal of Nobility of the Moscow Governorate. In memory of him the manor Obolyaninovo was named. Biography Born in the family of a poor Porkhov nobleman in 1752. Up to 16 years he lived with his parents in a village where he did not receive a systematic education: Military service began in 1768. He immediately stood out diligent performance of duties and unquestioning obedience to the orders of the higher authorities. With the rank of prime major, he retired in 1780; for several years he did not serve anywhere, living in his village. From 1783 ‚Äì provincial solicitor in the Pskov governorship; in a few years ‚Äì advisor in the civil court; in 1792 he received the rank of court councillor and was appointed to the post in the State Chamber. Possessing ambition, he bothered to be transferred to the army; civil service did not satisfy the ambitions of Peter Obolyaninov. In 1793 he entered the Gatchina troops in the rank of lieutenant colonel. Serving in Gatchina, he won the favor of Grand Duke Pavel Petrovich, after whose accession to the throne in 1796 his favor began. =Timeserver= In 1796, Peter Khrisanfovich, already in the rank of major general, was appointed provisionmaster-general, awarded the Order of Saint Anna and the Order of Saint Alexander Nevsky. After the accession of Paul, he became one of the closest confidants of the emperor; the royal favors followed one after another: in 1797 he was granted an estate in the Saratov province with 2 thousand souls, the next year he was promoted, became a lieutenant general, in 1799 he was appointed senator. The French king Louis XVIII granted him the commander's cross of the Order of Saint Lazarus of Jerusalem. Prosecutor General Peter Obolyaninov In February 1800, he took the post of procurator-general; in this position he did not stay long, until the coup of March 11, 1801. For this year of service he was generously rewarded: granted a large cross of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, the Order of St. Andrew, a large house in the capital, an imperial snuffbox with diamonds, porcelain and silver sets for 120 thousand rubles; was promoted to General of the Infantry. Pavel considered Obolyaninov \\"his\\". The competence of the procurator-general, which at the time was exceptionally broad, Obolyaninov tried to further expand, demanding, for example, from the Senate Chief Prosecutors, preliminary reports to him; at the same time, Pavel expanded it, ordering everyone to deliver his reports to Obolyaninov in general. Without mental and moral culture, deprived of at least practical service experience, Obolyaninov could hold in his post only with unquestioning obedience and precise performance. He never objected to the emperor, blindly following the commands; in affairs the arbitrariness was established. The heavy orders of the Pavlovian regime Obolyaninov aggravated by rudeness and aroused general hostility. The lack of upbringing and education affected the work at the highest post: he often scolded his subordinates, not being embarrassed in expressions; wrote with errors, distorting the name. However, he had the talent for staffing intelligent people in key positions. In the words of Dmitry Mertvago, Obolyaninov's colleague, Peter Khrisanfovich \\"became like a great Vizier\\" under the sovereign. The emperor Paul instructed him to take the oath of his sons Alexander and Konstantin on the memorable day of March 11, 1801. On the night of the same day, during the coup, Obolyaninov was arrested, and although he was immediately released, his career ended; a few days later he went to Moscow. Here, at first, he was forbidden even to visit a noble assembly, where Field Marshal Kamensky publicly called him \\"a state thief, a bribe taker, a fool stuffed\\". =Retired life= Before the invasion of the French, the Obolyaninovs lived openly in Moscow, receiving many guests. Obolyaninov managed to attract Moscow society with dinners and more than once he was elected the Marshal of Nobility. In this post, he even showed civil courage in 1826, raising his voice for the mitigation of punishment to Muscovite Decembrist Prince Yevgeny Obolensky, who was originally sentenced to the death penalty, then replaced by hard labor. In the fire of 1812, Obolyaninov's Moscow house on the corner of Tverskaya and Sadovaya streets, with a large garden and two outbuildings, burned down and was never really renewed. The couple moved to Obolyaninovo, situated near Moscow, where an elderly general engaged in the cultivation of flowers, and his wife became interested in dog breeding. According to the testimony of the mistress of the neighboring estate: The death of his wife had such a strong effect on Obolyaninov that he \\"slept on her bed until his death, on her pillows and was covered with the blanket under which she died\\". He himself died in the ninetieth year on September 22, 1841 in Moscow, in his house on Tverskaya. He was buried next to his wife in the Tver estate, in the parish church of the village of Tolozhnya, Novotorzhsky district. Matrimony Portrait of Anna Aleksandrovna by Vladimir Borovikovsky From January 19, 1795 he was married to Anna Alexandrovna Nashchokina, n√©e Yermolayeva (1754‚Äì1822), widow of court counselor Yakov Ivanovich Ordin-Nashchokin (1728‚Äì1793); the daughter of Lieutenant Alexander Petrovich Ermolaev and Ekaterina Gavrilovna BelkinaAnna Alexandrovna's younger sister was maternally married to Major General Yevgeny Olenin. In her youth, she was beautiful, distinguished by kindness and courtesy, but \\"very simple and without any education\\". Anna Alexandrovna told that when she married old Nashchokin, she tried to dress older than her years, and when she married Obolyaninov, she began to youth to appear younger. According to the testimony of Elizabeth Yankova, \\"since she was a great hunter before the dogs she held, she was just talking about dogs\\"; at night, the little dogs sometimes occupied the entire bed of the hostess, so that she herself \\"somehow clung to the edge\\". On December 31, 1800, for the merits of her husband, she was granted to the cavalier ladies of the Order of Saint Catherine of the Small Cross. In the last years of her life, Anna Alexandrovna was bedridden. Since her second marriage was childless, Obolyaninovo near Moscow was inherited by Peter Khrisanfovich's nephew ‚Äì Lieutenant Colonel Mikhail Mikhailovich Obolyaninov, whose daughter and heiress Anna married Count Adam Olsufyev.

After their marriage, they lived at 103 East 75th Street. * Oliver de Lancey Coster (‚Äì1947), who married Mary E. (n√©e Coppell) Booth (1869‚Äì1937), the widow of Edgar Hetfield Booth, in 1913. Her father, George Coppell, was the British Consul at New Orleans during the U.S. Civil War. They lived at Keewaydin in Tenafly, New Jersey. After Mary's death in 1937, Oliver remarried to Pauline Cory in 1939. Coster died at his country home in Westchester on November 2, 1917. His widow, who had a summer home in Southampton, New York known as \\"Wee Cot\\", died in November 1922 at her residence, 50 East 81st Street, which she inherited from her husband. Her funeral was held at St. James' Episcopal Church on Madison Avenue and she was buried alongside her husband at the Coster family vault in the churchyard of St. Peters' Church in the Village of Westchester (which is now the East Bronx). After Coster's death, his children auctioned off his estate with the Parish of St. Benedict's purchasing the family mansion in 1929 who used it as a schoolhouse until the Coster Mansion was torn down in 1930 and a new school was built in its place on Edison Avenue. To this day, St. Benedict's School stands on the same site.

The genus was differentiated on the base of several morphological characters, including the pseudolabiae, the buccal capsule, the cuticle with spines arranged as rings, the number of papillae in the male and the spicules. Etymology The etymology of Prospinitectus is not clearly explained in the original description but is obvious that the name of the genus refers to Spinitectus, another genus of Cystidicolidae.

Personal life Louis Dreller (who was Jewish) was born March 6, 1897, in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. In 1918, he graduated from the University of New Hampshire with a degree in electrical engineering. He later earned a master's degree from Columbia University. He married Edythe Maharan. They had two daughters. He died May 8, 1970, at Bethesda Naval Hospital, and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Career Upon graduating from the University of New Hampshire in 1918, Dreller was commissioned in the United States Navy as an ensign, initially for engineering duty only.

The film examines the results of Canada's relaxing of its marijuana laws at the same time that same-sex marriage became legal, along with Canada's abstention from the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq having made the country a perceived haven for progressive Americans. The documentary's events begin in the summer of 2003 when both same-sex marriage and marijuana were legalized (temporarily, in the case of the latter). The film underscores the contrast between the liberal movement in Canada and the more conservative attitude in the U.S., the premise being that \\"liberal attitudes beget liberal laws\\", and that \\"Canada, and not the U.S., is North America's pre-eminent freedom-loving country.\\" Synopsis Marc Emery Tommy Chong A voyage across Canada's \\"freedom adventure\\". The film follows the \\"Summer of Legalization\\" when same-sex marriage and \\"marijuana caf√©s\\" spread across the country. The film examines a \\"freedom boom\\": a stream of \\"escaping\\" AWOL American soldiers straight out of Iraq, followed by \\"reefer refugees\\", pot tourists and American same-sex couples. But within months, Canada re- criminalizes cannabis and there's a new campaign to turn back gay marriage. The film features interviews with, among others, then Vancouver mayor (now Senator) Larry Campbell, Tommy Chong, Marc Emery, seen travelling the country and smoking marijuana in front of police stations, ex-U.S. soldier Brandon Hughey, trying to avoid serving in the Iraq War, and the couple known as the Michaels, whose improptu wedding started a wave of gay marriages, and their lawyer Martha McCarthy. Production Albert Nerenberg felt that the two legal decisions concerning same-sex marriage and marijuana were made on the same day in 2003 was \\"very significant\\", as \\"something revealing about the direction of Canada as a country.\\" Then, when the government made it clear that Canada would not be participating in \\"the Iraq adventure, I realized we were having our very own summer of love.\\" Elevator Films was founded as a new branch of Toronto production company Trailervision, which had co-produced Nerenberg and Shannon's previous film, Stupidity. The film was originally conceived as a short film or TV hour, but grew to feature-length after attracting the attention of the National Film Board's Silva Basmajian. It began shooting on a $170,000 budget. Release and reception Escape to Canada had its world premiere at the New Montreal FilmFest on 19 September 2005. It went on to be screened shortly thereafter in Alberta, at the 2005 Calgary International Film Festival on 30 September and 1 October, and at the Edmonton International Film Festival on 8 October. It played at the Whistler Film Festival on 3 December. The film was more generally released in Qu√©bec cinemas for the first time on 17 February 2006, and in Ontario in March 2006, including at the Kingston Canadian Film Festival on 12 March. In Hamilton and elsewhere, a few screenings were shut down \\"due to a fog of pot smoke in the air\\". Escape to Canada played on 28 May 2006 as the closing night feature at the DOXA Documentary Film Festival in Vancouver. =Critical response= Matt McMillan praises the film overall, appreciating its \\"wry wit and AD/HD editing velocity\\", calling Nerenberg's style \\"one of the most distinctive\\" in Canadian documentaries. Dorothy Woodend compares Escape to Canada favourably to Nerenberg's last film, Stupidity, saying it \\"packs a similar punch\\", and that the film is \\"jammed with both ephemera and critical ideas ... but one of the things that stands out most clearly is the high cost of courage.\\" Dominic Bouchard, while acknowledging the limitations of the film's binary oppositions, appreciated its caustic humour, comparing it favourably to the work of Michael Moore, as does Louis Proyect, specifically, to Sicko. Christopher Long calls the documentary \\"both a sincere ode and a tongue-in- cheek look\\" at Canada, calling it \\"no masterpiece\\", noting \\"quite a bit of redundancy in the film\\", and that it \\"briefly touches on the subject of American soldiers seeking asylum in Canada as they refuse to fight in Iraq, but the thread receives scant attention compared to the gay marriage and pot themes.\\" Eddie Cockerell, writing for Variety, found the film's technique \\"OK\\", noted the \\"variety of home-grown rock tunes\\", but felt the film was \\"marred by rather too many aerial shots of forests and waterfalls used to segue between subjects.\\" Teacher-librarian Joanne Peters agreed, assigning the film 2 stars out of 4, recommending it with reservations: \\"Escape to Canada offers an interesting perspective on the convergence of forces for social change. And, it offers yet another look at how Canadians differ from Americans. At the same time, the movie makes some sweeping generalizations about both nations and certainly could have used better editing\\", saying aerial shots of wildlife becoming tiresome by third viewing, and even though the interviews lend credibility to the filmmakers' argument, they, too, are repetitive. Assigning the film 1.5 stars, novelist and critic Kate Taylor finds \\"this initially amusing\\" documentary \\"quickly loses both its smarts and its comedy because Nerenberg has mistaken a topic and an attitude for a theme\\"; moreover, the film greatly exaggerates Canada's reputation for moral conservatism so that Nerenberg can suggest 2003 was a revolution, \\"and he never does reveal any evidence of a larger trend\\"; Taylor argues that if these events \\"do reflect a liberalization of Canadian society in contrast to the United States, then that is not a revolution but rather an evolution that has a historical and political context far beyond Nerenberg's scope.\\" She also found the film highly repetitive, and offering a degree of detail only Canadians can really appreciate, but who also will recognize that the film lacks any context with which to frame the events it portrays. Travis Mackenzie Hoover feels the film engages in \\"smug self-regard\\" and does not need to be seen by any \\"marginally well-informed person\\": > The influx of gay Americans yearning to be freer than in the land of the > free is indeed touching, as is the saga of the ludicrous rigmarole pot users > must endure once Canada institutes a medical marijuana policy and makes > recreational use illegal again. But though the struggle for the spliff is > rather interesting, the ultimate purpose of the documentary is to make > Canadians feel high and mighty about our perceived superiority. Not only is > this untenable when the film turns its attention to American soldiers > avoiding the Iraq war (that Afghanistan thing is, apparently, just a hiccup) > but it allows people to relax and think that there are no real problems in > our country - a self-deluding lie that papers over the real issues that face > Canadians. Nerenberg's own take on whether the film had actually captured something of a Canadian zeitgeist or genuinely presaged anything to come, when asked, was this: \\"Even if it's just a stab at capturing what's been happening lately, the film shows us in a different light. Among young people, the old self- effacement is starting to wane, and Canadians are starting to be proud of their uniqueness.\\" =Home media= Escape to Canada was released on both VHS and DVD on 19 June 2007. The disc (by Disinformation Studios) includes 100 minutes of \\"bonus footage and extended interviews, 20 minutes more than the movie proper,\\" including additional or extended interviews with Tommy Chong, Marc Emery, and Martha McCarthy. Marketing and related works Nerenberg was said by Eddie Cockrell to prefer nighttime screenings for Escape to Canada and to have encouraged audiences to \\"experience his work in something called \\"Stonervision\\".\\" =Don't Mind If I Do (unproduced)= While still in production, Escape to Canada was reported to have had a spin-off TV hour, Don't Mind If I Do, \\"about the busloads of gay and lesbian couples heading north to tie the knot,\\" but this does not appear to have come to fruition as a separate project. =Why Is It Sexy?= Nerenberg and Brown are both named as executive producers of a pilot for the Discovery Channel called Why is it Sexy?, looking at the science of sexual attraction. In October 2004, Unstable Ground confirmed they had done some editing for the pilot. It was broadcast as a TV special on 15 May 2005.

It is signed at the bottom FRANCISCUS ƒê ZURBARAN/ FACIEBAT. 1629.. It shows Peter the Apostle crucified upside-down appearing to Peter Nolasco, founder of the Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy, which redeemed Christian slaves from Muslim owners during the Reconquista period in Spanish history. When he was prevented from making a hoped-for trip to Rome to visit St Peter's tomb, he received a consolatory vision from St Peter instructing him to convert Spain. It forms a pair with the same artist's The Vision of Saint Peter Nolasco, in which the saint dreams of the Heavenly Jerusalem. Both works were produced the year after Nolasco's canonisation for the Convent of Mercy in Seville, which he had founded and which now houses the city's Museum of Fine Arts The two works formed part of a group of 22 paintings commissioned by the monastery from various artists to mark the canonisation - only eleven now survive. In 1808 the work was bought by Manuel L√≥pez Cepero, dean of Seville Cathedral, who thirteen years later gave it to Ferdinand VII of Spain.

It is the western terminus and operational base of the preserved Aln Valley Railway which is currently working to rebuild the original Alnwick branch line from there to Alnmouth station. The station was constructed on a different site from the original Alnwick station due to the construction of the A1 Alnwick bypass which removed a section of the original trackbed on the edge of the town as well as the construction of buildings on the original station site and some of the trackbed on the approach to it.  History  The Newcastle & Berwick Railway (N&BR;) main line between and Berwick was authorised by an Act of Parliament of 31 July 1845 but due to its primary purpose being for inter-city traffic, it passed almost 3 miles east of Alnwick, the area's main market town. Thus also included within this act were powers to construct a branch line to link Alnwick to the main line at Alnmouth station. Nonetheless, the company's priority was to construct its main line which was completed 1 July 1847. The delay to the opening of the branch line meant that a temporary horse-bus service was provided between Alnwick and Lesbury station on the main line. This was, however, short-lived and the contract for construction of the branch was let in August 1848, with rapid progress meaning that the line could formally open on the 5 August 1850. The original 1850 Alnwick station was constructed at the edge of the town, adjacent to Shilbottle Coal Company depot (linked to Shilbottle Colliery by a wagonway). It was a modest single-platform station and a steady growth in traffic meant that it had become inadequate by 1885 when Alnwick Town Council requested that North Eastern Railway (NER) (successor to the N&BR;) improve the facilities provided for the town. After some initial reluctance, the NER constructed a new station, closer to the town centre, which opened on 5 September 1887, coinciding with the opening of the NER-built Alnwick to Cornhill Railway, and converted the original station building to a warehouse. From the 1920s onwards, traffic on Northumberland's railways declined due to improvements in road transport, resulting in the early closure of the Cornhill line to passengers on 22 September 1930. By the mid-1960s the branch from Alnmouth was making significant losses and despite attempts to reduce costs by singling the line, it was ultimately decided that the line should close. The closure of the intention to close the line, and station, was announced in March 1966 and was to take effect on 6 June 1966 however significant opposition led to an appeal being made to the Ministry of Transport. The appeal was unsuccessful and closure was authorised on 28 September 1967; consequentially, passenger services were withdrawn from 29 January 1968 and goods services ceased on 7 October of that year. After the station's closure the station goods yard and the approach were gradually converted to other uses, with main station building being ultimately converted for retail use, including the Barter Books second-hand bookshop.  Preservation  Plans to redevelop the original station site in 1993 (though later abandoned) led to the formation of the Aln Valley Railway Society (AVRS) (since amalgamated into the Aln Valley Railway Trust) in 1995; in 1997 the AVRS announced its intention to reopen almost the entire line utilising the last available section of the original station as its western terminus and reconstructing the rest of the line from there to Alnmouth. However, the high cost of bridging the dual-carriageway Alnwick bypass meant these plans ultimately proved unsuccessful and instead plans were later revised so that a new station would be built on site close to where the A1 intersected the original line. Planning permission to construct the new station and rebuild the original line as far as Edenhill Bridge was granted by Northumberland County Council on 1 July 2010, the lease for the site signed on 22 February 2012 and groundworks began 5 days later. The station site first opened to visitors five months later on 14 July, but only to demonstrate the ongoing work, exhibits of rolling stock and an indoor exhibition area, caf√©, souvenir shop and model railway; the first train (an engineer's train) did not run until 3 November 2012. Passengers were first carried 28 March 2013 using the railway's Wickham trolley for short rides from the railway's sidings to the eastern headshunt at the oppersite end of the site; this service continued throughout the 2013 season. Later that year, on 10 September, a steam locomotive operated within the new station site for the first time (though not for public passengers) and the station was formally opened by the Duke of Northumberland on 30 October 2013. By October 2015, initial plans for the station (including the platforms, footbridge, signal box and locomotive shed) were virtually complete and thus work began on linking the station's track layout with the original trackbed to Alnmouth. The new station was constructed within a field at a higher level than the original trackbed adjacent to it (there being a difference in height of approximately 4 metres between them) and thus it was necessary to partially infill a section of the original railway cutting adjacent to the site to allow trains to descend onto the original alignment at a suitable gradient. The link to the original alignment was completed in time for the first public passenger services to run from Lionheart station onto the original trackbed on 28 December 2017: the first time that public passenger service had operated on the original line for almost 50 years. As of August 2018, passenger trains regularly run from the station to Alndyke Farm Crossing, just beyond Bridge 6. In July 2018, the AVRT was awarded a Rural Development Programme for England grant (using funds jointly provided by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) together with 20% match funding from Sustrans which constitute a total of ¬£146,600. The grant is to be used to cover the costs of groundworks and track materials to extend the running line for a further 1 mile to a point just before the line passed under Edenhill Bridge where it will also cover the costs of constructing a new station, '. As of December 2018, work is underway on the construction of this extension. Most of the station facilities are currently provided in portacabins (though a single-story waiting shelter has been constructed on platform 2 and a grounded NER coach body provides temporary waiting facilities on platform 1) however the railway has longer-term ambitions to create a permanent station building, broadly inspired by that at the former Warkworth station but with a roof styled after those used at stations on the Alnwick to Cornhill railway. Early designs for this envisage a two-story \\"H-shaped\\" central nucleus containing a large entrance hall, toilets and kitchen on the lower floor and a museum, offices and education rooms on the upper floor. It is also intended to include two wings: the northern (Alnmouth end) one would provide a caf√© area while the southern (buffer stop end) one accommodate a shop, boiler room and stations master's office. Elsewhere within the station site, in the longer-term it is intended that a replica goods shed (to be used for maintenance) and NER-style coal drop will be created on the east side of the existing storage sidings and an additional platform will be created on the loading road.

Guajardo was the fifth in a family of six children. Both her father, a former peasant farmer in Mexico, and her mother were illiterate. She grew up in migrant camps in the San Joaquin Valley and attended three different elementary schools. Though her home was Spanish- speaking, she was conversant in English by second grade. Her parents placed a strong emphasis on education, and took their children to the library to encourage reading.

She pursued her interests in children and education through extracurricular activities such as tutoring in an African-American high school and volunteer work at Massachusetts General Hospital. She earned her bachelor's degree in psychology and social relations at Harvard in 1982. She received her master's degree in clinical psychology at the University of Denver in 1985, followed by a doctorate in clinical psychology from the same institution in 1988. For her doctoral dissertation, she studied the reasons for educational attainment and school dropout rate among Latina teens, focusing on the question, \\"What is it that allows students just like me to succeed in education?\\" Her research, which included interviews with approximately 600 students and their families, pointed toward \\"strong relationships with encouraging figures, particularly mothers\\" for those who succeeded in school, and dissatisfaction as early as elementary school for those who dropped out. Career =Government= Guajardo's dissertation led to her hiring as the Dropout Prevention Coordinator at the Colorado Department of Education from 1988 to 1991. Among her achievements in this role were the receipt of a Kellogg National Fellowship to study \\"the role children have in creating world peace\\". She also traveled to international conferences to discuss the improvement of living conditions for children in developing countries.

In 2003, Mayor of Denver John Hickenlooper tapped Guajardo to become executive director of the Mayor's Office for Education and Children, a position she held for eight years. Guajardo helped promote a Denver preschool bill which provides access to high-level preschool options for four- year-old children from low-income families, and implemented the 5 by 5 Project, which provides children enrolled in the Head Start program with \\"five formative cultural experiences by the time they are 5 years old\\". Through another initiative, the Lights On After School Partnership, Guajardo enabled funding for more than 700 after-school programs servicing more than 50,000 students. =Teaching= Guajardo has frequently mentored young Latinas. From 2012 to 2013, she was a national speaker and trainer on the topics of \\"leadership, inclusive excellence, and racial healing\\". In 2013, Guajardo moved to Tokyo, Japan, to develop a new degree program in international liberal arts at S≈çka University. In 2013 she became a professor in that program, and also served as dean from 2013 to 2016. She was the first non- Japanese dean in that institution. In 2016 she was promoted to deputy vice president of S≈çka University. In 2018, she was one of three finalists for the presidency of Fort Lewis College in Durango, Colorado.

Born Raymond Dabb in London, he came to the United States in 1850 as a young child, and was raised in Union, New Jersey, and later lived in neighboring Elizabeth, New Jersey. He served in the Union Army during the Civil War. After his military service, he attended the Pennington Seminary. He then studied at the National Academy of Design in New York from 1868 to 1872, and was hired as an instructor for one year after his graduation. In 1873, he was hired as a faculty member by Mills Seminary in Oakland, California, the first women's college west of the Rocky Mountains.He settled in Oakland with his wife, the former Annie Meeker. In 1875, he legally changed his name, as did his wife, adding his mother's maiden name as their surnames. Essentially a Realist, he specialized in painting the seashores and mountains of Northern California. Originally a follower of the Hudson River School, Yelland adopted a style called Luminism, inspired by artists such as Sanford Robinson Gifford and John F. Kensett. In the 1890s, Yelland was influenced by Tonalism, along with contemporaries like William Keith and George Inness. One of his paintings, Cities of the Golden Gate, a view of Oakland and San Francisco from the Berkeley hills, was described as \\"monumental\\" and a \\"heroic panorama bathed in a revelatory light\\". Yelland taught for many years at the California School of Design, and also at the University of California, Berkeley in the years before his death. He became ill in the early months of 1900, and died of pneumonia at his home in Oakland that July. The first solo exhibition of his work in 50 years took place at the Crocker Art Museum in Sacramento in 2018.

He was chief surgeon at Frederick's Hospital from 1781 to 1795, professor of anatomy and surgery at the Royal Danish Academy of Surgery from its foundation in 1785 and was appointed as court surgeon in 1802. He died unmarried and granted most of his estate to the hospital as well as to the associated F√∏dselsstiftelsen. Early life and career Winsl√∏w was born in Copenhagen, the son of medal engraver Peter Christian Winsl√∏w and Anna Dorothea Siewers. In 1756, his father brought him along when he left the country to pursuit a new life in Russia but left him in Stockholm from where he was returned to his mother in Copenhagen. He served in the household of a maternal uncle from an early age. The uncle, a barber from Christianshavn, taught him the trade of surgery. At the age of 14 he also began to receive training at Grederick's Hospital where chief surgeon Alexander K√∏lpin \\"accustomed his ear, heart and hand to the surgical profession\\". He also began to follow Heinrich Callisen's lectures at the Theatrum Anatomico-chirurgicum and was trained in dissection by Georg Heuermann. He also followed the lectures of V. Hennings and Johan Clemens Tode. In 1769 the anatomist and botanist Christen Friis Rottb√∏ll made the hard-working and ambitious seventeen-year-old student his prosector and later that same year he was appointed to army company surgeon. Callisen now saw to his further education at the Theatrum Anatomico-chirurgicum and after his return to Denmark from a journey abroad in 1771 secured him a position as assistant surgeon at the s√∏kv√¶sthuset. That same year he also enrolled at the University of Copenhagen where he, in 1773, became prosector and began to lecture. In 1774-77, Winsl√∏w served as surgeon at Frederick's Hospital, first under K√∏lpin and then under J. E. Behrens. Travels In 1777, assisted by royal physician J. C. J. v. Berger, who was a member of the hospital's board of directors, Winsl√∏w obtained a royal travel stipend. He initially went to Paris where the memory of his relative, the anatomist Jacob B. Winslow, was still alive and opened all doors. He mainly studied under Pierre-Joseph Desault but also under Rapha√´l Bienvenu Sabatier and Jean-Louis Baudelocque. From Paris he continued to London where he mainly studied under William and John Hunter. Chief surgeon and professor Frederik Christian Winsl√∏w Winsl√∏w returned to Denmark in 1780 and succeeded Behrens as head surgeon at Frederick's Hospital the following year. He represented the surgeons in the gfeud against the physicians with Callisen as his direct opponent. He was appointed to professor of anatomy and surgery when the Royal Danish Academy of Surgery was founded in the 1785. He also operated a lucrative private practice. He eas succeeded by H. C. F. Schumacher in 1795 but remained active at the Royal Danish Academy of Surgery. He was the first in the country to hold weekly clinical-surgical lectures. Work Winsl√∏w's few written works from his early career are insignificant. His observations during the dissection of cats and dog of respiratory movements of fetuses intra ovum enabled P. Scheels to write his thesis on this subject. Inspired by his time in London, he was active in the debate on vaccinations. In 1801 he made the first successful Cowpox vaccinations in the country, using lymph acquired directly from Edward Jenner. He was later an active member of the Vaccination Commission. During the siege and bombardment of Copenhagen, Winsl√∏w was responsible for organizing the lazarets and personally acted as head surgeon at one of them. He was appointed as court surgeon in 1801. He became a member of the new sundhedskollegium as well as of the Royal Medical Society in 1803. Personal life Winsl√∏w never married. His ability to work was inhibited by increasing problems with dropsy during the lat years of his life which ultimately caused his death. He left most of his estate to Frederick's Hospital and F√∏dselsstiftelsen. One of the apartments in Gammel kloster was named F. C.Winsl√∏w's Apartment after him.

The Globe and Mail, May 14, 1983. An examination of incest, the film stars Raymond Cloutier as Andr√©, a married father who is committing incest with his daughters, and Marie Tifo as Mych√®le, his unhappily married wife whose resentment of their daughters has led her to turn a blind eye to her husband's activities.\\"Film reduces family to a lab of horrors\\".

Reviewing the film during its theatrical run, his colleague Carole Corbeil gave it a more nuanced review, likening it to \\"one long bad For the Record; it invents characters to advance a theme\\", but calling it \\"honest, and gritty, and this quality redeems it somewhat\\".

It was launched along with POPPY 2, an ELINT surveillance package, as well as three other satellites, boosted into orbit via a Thor Augmented Delta-Agena D rocket on June 15, 1963. Background The SOLRAD science satellite program was conceived in 1958 to observe the Sun in the X-ray spectrum. It was quickly combined, to provide civilian cover (launches being unclassified at that time), with the concurrently conceived United States Naval Research Laboratory's GRAB satellite project, which would collect information on foreign radars and communications installations. There were five SOLRAD/GRAB missions between 1960‚Äì62, with the scientific SOLRAD experiments sharing satellite space with GRAB's intelligence payload. Two of the missions were successful. In 1962, all U.S. overhead reconnaissance projects were consolidated under the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), which elected to continue and expand the GRAB mission starting July 1962 with a next-generation set of satellites, code-named POPPY. With the initiation of POPPY, SOLRAD experiments would no longer be carried on electronic spy satellites; rather, they would now get their own satellites, launched alongside POPPY missions to provide some measure of mission cover. The first POPPY mission was launched on December 13, 1962 along with several other satellites on a mission similar to that of SOLRAD 3, complete with an Injun (satellite) ionospheric research satellite. The mission was successful, despite POPPY 1's elliptical (rather than the planned circular) orbit, and data was returned for 28 months. No SOLRAD was launched concurrent with this first POPPY mission. The launch of POPPY 1 from the same pad and with the same rocket as SOLRAD 6/POPPY2 Spacecraft SOLRAD 6 (also called SOLRAD 6A) was larger than its SOLRAD/GRAB predecessors: 24 inches in diameter (from 20) and with a nine-inch equatorial band giving the craft an elongated rather than spherical form. The satellite was equipped with six X-ray detecting ion chambers, two more than its predecessors, covering the ranges of 0.1-1.6√Ö, .5-3√Ö, 2-6√Ö, 2-8√Ö, 8-16√Ö, and 44-60√Ö. Mission and results Launched on June 15, 1963 (COSPAR 1963-021C) via a Thor Augmented Delta-Agena D rocket from Vandenberg AFB with four other satellites, SOLRAD 6 was placed into an incorrect elliptical orbit, its perigee so low that the atmosphere soon caused the satellite to decay from orbit on July 31, 1963. Because of its short orbital lifetime, SOLRAD 6 returned relatively little data. Moreover, the Sun was very quiet during the satellite's six weeks of operation, and the four Lyman-Alpha photometers capable of registering X-ray emissions with wavelengths shorter than 8√Ö reported no results. No scientific data were ever published from SOLRAD 6's measurements, and the strip chart recordings of them were no longer available as of 1991.

It was introduced by John Sarbanes (D-MD) on January 3, 2019, on behalf of the newly elected Democratic majority as the first official legislation of the 116th United States Congress. The House passed the bill on March 8, 2019 by a vote of 234‚Äì193 along strict party lines. , it has not been passed by the Senate. The bill's provisions fall into three major categories: * Campaign finance reform. The bill would introduce voluntary public financing for campaigns, matching small donations at a 6:1 ratio.Catie Edmondson, House Democrats Will Vote on Sweeping Anti-Corruption Legislation. Here's What's in It., New York Times (March 7, 2019). It also incorporates campaign finance reform provisions from the DISCLOSE Act,Kate Ruane & Sonia Gill, Congress, Let's Fix the Problems in H.R. 1 So We Can Enact the Bill's Much-Needed Reforms, American Civil Liberties Union (March 5, 2019). which would impose stricter limitations on foreign lobbying, require Super PACs and other \\"dark money\\" organizations to disclose their donors, and restructure the Federal Election Commission to reduce partisan gridlock. The bill also expresses support for a constitutional amendment to overturn the Citizens United decision, where the Supreme Court held that virtually unlimited political spending by corporations, labor unions, and other associations was a constitutional right. * Government ethics. The bill would require presidential and vice-presidential candidates to disclose their previous 10 years of income-tax returns, eliminate the use of taxpayer money by politicians to settle sexual harassment claims, and create a new ethics code for the U.S. Supreme Court, which is not subject to existing judicial codes of conduct. * Voting rights. The bill would create a national voter- registration program, make Election Day a federal holiday, replace partisan gerrymandering with nonpartisan commissions to draw electoral districts, and limit efforts to purge voting rolls. The bill was viewed as a comprehensive statement of the priorities of the Democratic House majority elected in 2018. The New York Times called the bill \\"the Democrats' signature piece of legislation.\\" Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate Majority Leader, pledged that the bill was \\"not going to go anywhere in the Senate.\\" In March 2019, McConnell said he would not put the bill to a vote on the Senate floor. Sarbanes, the legislation's drafter, argued that the bill's public popularity would ultimately lead to its passage.  Voting rights for felons  The authority of the United States Congress over elections is extensive. One feature of the proposed legislation is that convicted felons could not be denied the right to vote unless currently in prison. Whether congressional authority extends this far is subject to disagreement, with arguments being made for and against. Fourteen states have laws that indefinitely deny voting rights for some convicted felons, twenty-two do not restore voting rights until after parole and/or probation, and some states require payment of fines or restitution.The 14 states include Maryland, where convictions for buying or selling votes can only be restored through pardon, and Florida, where those convicted of murder or a felony sexual offense must still petition the governor for restoration of voting rights on a case by case basis. Florida was also included in the 22 number since for other felonies voting rights are restored after parole/probation. Supreme Court ethics  Another part of the proposed legislation instructs the Judicial Conference to establish rules of ethics binding on the Supreme Court. It is unclear whether Congress has the constitutional authority to impose ethics requirements on Supreme Court Justices, a question the Court may have to decide. In 2011, Chief Justice John Roberts made clear in his end-of-year report that he believed Congress does not have the power to impose conduct rules on the Supreme Court, because the Supreme Court was established by the Constitution, according to which the justices serve as long as they exhibit \\"good behavior,\\" or face possible impeachment and removal for \\"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\\" Lower federal courts, by contrast, were created by Congress and are subject to rules Congress establishes. Because of this, some suggest that the purpose of the proposed ethics rules would not be punishment or even enforcement, but only a promulgation of rules so that Supreme Court justices can be held accountable for their conduct in the court of public opinion. In addition, a documented ethics violation could be relevant to a potential impeachment proceeding. Others argue that Congress has the authority to require the Supreme Court to write its own code of ethics. In 1991 the Supreme Court adopted a resolution that its officers and employees will comply with the substance of the Judicial Conference Regulations, subject to stated clarifications.  Statehood for the District of Columbia  The proposed legislation also calls for statehood for the District of Columbia, arguing that the District has a larger population than two states, Wyoming and Vermont, and is close to the population of the seven states that have a population of under one million fully represented residents, and claiming that Congress has the authority to admit new States to the union through legislation. Others argue that a constitutional amendment would be required. The question of admission of the District of Columbia as a state has a long history. Statehood for D.C. is expected to be opposed by Republicans, since it would almost certainly put more Democrats in Congress. The House approved H.R. 51, which would make the populated portion of the District a state, in June of 2020, on a near-uniform party line vote; the measure was not taken up in the Republican-controlled Senate.https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/politics/dc-statehood-house- vote.html  Gerrymandering  Congressional redistricting occurs every 10 years as congressional boundaries are redrawn after the Census. Under Article One of the Constitution, the state legislature controls this process. In order to prevent gerrymandering, the proposed legislation would require states to use independent commissions to design their congressional districts. If they declined to do so, the federal government would set one up for them. The 2015 U.S. Supreme Court decision Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission affirmed that even though the Constitution calls for the legislature to draw the district lines, an independent commission could constitutionally be appointed (by the state) to perform this function. In the 2019 decisions Rucho v. Common Cause and Benisek v. Lamone the Supreme Court found that gerrymandering was a nonjusticiable political question, leaving any solution to the other branches of government.  Number of Federal Election Commissioners  Under current law, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) is made up of six members, no more than three of whom can be members of the same political party, with at least four votes being required for any official FEC action. The complaint is that this has resulted in an impotent and gridlocked FEC, with important reforms being left unaddressed, such as the updating of campaign finance law for the digital age and the effective regulation of political donations. Some advocates for reform have blamed the Republican members of the FEC for being unwilling either to investigate any potential violations or to impose tougher restrictions, and for loosening restrictions simply by signaling what standards they are willing to enforce. The proposed bill would give the FEC five commissioners instead of six, reducing the likelihood of tie votes, and would require that no more than two can be members of the same political party. It would set up a \\"Blue Ribbon Advisory Panel\\" consisting of an odd number of individuals selected by the president from retired Federal judges, former law enforcement officials, or individuals with experience in election law, except that the president could not select any individual to serve on the panel who holds any public office at the time of selection, but the president would not be required to choose from among those recommended by the panel. Some observers claim that there would be no built-in benefit for either party.  Reactions and statements  On January 29, 2019, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell issued a statement criticizing the Act as a \\"one-sided power grab\\" by the Democratic Party and assuring that \\"It may pass the House, but not the Senate\\". He called the bill the \\"Democrat Politician Protection Act\\" in the statement. He further criticized the bill for giving the federal government more power over elections, saying it would \\"[give] Washington D.C. politicians even more control over who gets to come here [Congress] in the first place.\\" On March 6, McConnell indicated to journalists that he would not allow the bill a vote on the Senate floor, even as he would allow a vote on the Green New Deal resolution. Representative Dan Crenshaw (R-TX-2) tweeted criticism of the Act in March.

Life and career  Having been born in Boston, he spent most of his life there and summer in New Ipswich, New Hampshire. His artistic training began at Mass Normal Art School and included his apprenticeship at Cowles Art School, where he also was a watercolor painting instructor. He also attended the Julian Academie in Paris. It was in Paris that he met his wife the also artist Lee Lufkin Kaula (1865 - 1957) in Crecy, France, in 1894. They married in 1902 and they maintained a house and a studio in the Fenway Studios in the USA. Celebrated for its Impressionist landscapes, William Kaula was one of the leading painters of the Boston School. Born in Boston, Kaula studied at the Julian Academie in Paris and studied with Edmund Tarbell, the famed landscaper, at the Boston Museum School. In Boston, Tarbell was among his most admired mentors and the two painted side by side in New Hampshire. Kaula is among the most talented students of landscape painting under the influence of Tarbell and was known as a \\"Tarbellite\\". Although he seldom (or never) chose themes typically associated with the Boston School, or interiors or formally dressed figures, he is strongly associated with the group, and held a position of esteem in Boston's artistic circles. Kaula participated and exhibited at the Pan-Pacific Exposition of 1915. As his career progressed, Kaula's aerial landscapes became increasingly expressionist, and now he is considered Tarbell's greatest student. Throughout his career, Kaula has exhibited at the Paris Salon, at the National Drawing Academy, at the Corcoran Gallery of Art and at the Boston Art Club. The Copley Society of Art held a retrospective of William Kaula before his death in 1953; the Smithsonian Museum of American Art, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the National Museum of Georgia and the Washington County Museum of Art are currently showcasing their work. The work of William J. Kaula is being rediscovered recently, The Springfield Museums held an exhibition along with the launch of the book on the work of the painter and his wife: Two Lives One Passion: The Life and Work of William Jurian Kaula and Lee Lufkin Kaula.

The park highlights the highly varied geology of the northeastern Carpathians, as well as the deep spruce forests of the region. The park is located in the Putyla District of Chernivtsi Oblast. Topography The park stands in the historical region of Bukovina, a roughly 60 km diameter sector of the Eastern Carpathians that straddled the border of present-day Ukraine and Romania. Cheremosky was originally assembled in 2009 from three existing nature reserves: * Black Dil Nature Reserve, which was originally established in 1972 as a geological reserve, with a close placement of different types of metamorphic shale, grano-diorites, Triassic-Jurassic carbonates, and sedimentary rock. * State Enterprise Putil Forest, covering the upper reaches of the White Cheremosh River, and protecting important geological sites and landforms, *Marmaros Crystalline Massif, a limestone mountain with caves and a mine. Black Dil Spit, Cheremosh Mountain National Park The elements of the park occupy elevations from 947 meters to 1574 meters Climate and ecoregion The Cheremosky area has a Humid continental climate - warm summer sub-type (K√∂ppen climate classification Dfb), with large seasonal temperature differentials and a warm summer (at least four or more months averaging over , but no month averaging over ). Precipitation in the general region averages 850 mm/yr, of which about 300 mm/yr falls in the park as snow. The average temperature in January is , and the average temperature in August is . Because the park is at higher elevations, its climate is cooler than the surrounding lowlands. The park is in the Carpathian montane conifer forests ecoregion. This region covers the Carpathians across their entire length, from Poland to the south of Romania, with the Cheremosky National Park approximately in the center. Flora and fauna The dominant vegetation is spruce forest, which covers 80% of the park. Interspersed are mountain meadows, lakes and rivers, with the occasional stand of old-growth forest containing fir, pine and deciduous trees at lower altitudes. The park is especially known for it wide variety of mountain wildflowers. Public use The park features hiking trails and mountain biking trails. Park rangers provide ecological education and tours to local school children and to interested visitors.

Packer was baptized on 10 February 1678, the only son of John Packer of Shellingford and his wife Elizabeth Stephens, daughter of Richard Stephens of Eastington, Gloucestershire. In 1687 he succeeded to his father's property. He married Mary Winchcombe, daughter of Sir Henry Winchcombe, 2nd Baronet, and his brother-in-law was Henry St John who married his wife's sister Frances Winchcombe. In November 1701 it is reported that Packer lost the thumb of his left hand in an accident with a gun. Packer was well established in the county, and was appointed a deputy-lieutenant in 1703 and served as High Sheriff of Berkshire for the year 1708 to 1709. When St. John was raised to the peerage as Viscount Bolingbroke in 1712, Packer was returned unopposed Member of Parliament for Berkshire at the ensuing by-election on 23 July 1712. He was co-opted to present an address from the county to the Queen before he had technically taken his seat in the House of Commons. He voted on 18 June 1713 for the French commerce bill. At the 1713 general election he was returned unopposed and was classed as a Tory. He was returned unopposed at the 1715 general election and elected in contests in 1722 and 1727. He voted consistently against the Government. Packer died on 4 April 1731. He had five sons, of whom one predeceased him, and one daughter. His eldest son Winchcombe Howard Packer inherited his seat in parliament and the Winchcombe inheritance which he finally gained possession of in about 1733, after an ongoing dispute with Bolingbroke.

Located in Denver, Colorado, the school was established to teach and promote the medical theories of its founder, Dr. John Henry Tilden.  Doctrine  Dr. John Henry Tilden, 1851-1940 Tilden believed that toxemia, the build up of toxins and waste in the body, was ‚Äúthe universal cause of all diseases‚Äù. He believed that only a strict adherence to his dietary principles, a prudent lifestyle and proper hygiene would restore health and cure all illness. Tilden's techniques taught at the school included fasting, prescribed menus of carefully balanced food combinations, restrictions and rules on liquid intake, the necessity of fresh air and sunshine, colonic cleansing, rest and the elimination of stress both mental and physical. His philosophy of the body healing itself rather than outside interventions such as drugs or surgery foreshadowed modern naturopathy.World Naturopathic Federation, WNF White Paper: Naturopathic Philosophies, Principles and Theories, 2017 page 48  History  Tilden promoted his school and views through lecture tours, books, articles and a series of journals under the titles A Stuffed Club (1900 - 1915), Philosophy of Health, and Dr. Tilden's Health Review and Critique (1926-40) The school was advertised as the place \\"where thousands 'Hopelessly Ill' get well without drugs, serums or surgery.\\"Where Thousands \\"Hopelessly Ill\\" Get Well Without Drugs, Serums or Surgery, Physical Culture, April 1927, page 79. Private collection of N. Grabsztul The Tilden School for Teaching Health attracted patients from all over the country and world including Canada, Great Britain and Australia. It offered furnished apartments for its patients to learn to take care of themselves and practice the Tilden techniques for healthy living. As many of his patients stayed for extended periods of time, the school's architecture and grounds were designed to invoke more of an ambiance of a residential apartment complex as opposed to a traditional medical facility. Summer months were the busiest for the school as patients were attracted by the pleasant summer Colorado climate. At its peak, the Tilden School housed eighty five patients with a staff of thirty employees.Vos, Arthur, Jr. Interview, 3 December 1994, Denver, CO, by Thomas Simmons, Front Range Research Associates For those who could not travel to the school, Tilden offered his consultation and prescribed diets via mail for $50 per month. Tilden was involved in the operation of the school until 1924 when he sold most of his interest in the enterprise to Arthur Vos, Andrew Jergens (heir to the Jergens Soap Company fortune) and Frank C. Adams for $150,000.Rocky Mountain News, 18 December 1924, page 9 It is unclear if this is when the name was shortened to the Tilden Health School.Historic Postcard advertisement for the Tilden School 1926: Private collection of Steve and Jan Davis In December 1924, after a falling out with the new owners, Tilden parted ways with the school and in 1926 opened a new operation in east Denver called the Tilden Health Institute. He operated the Institute until his death in 1940. Vos operated the Tilden Health School until 1931, when the effects of the Great Depression forced its closure. Vos's son, Arthur Vos, Jr. was appointed receiver of the property by the Denver District Court. Eventually the campus was divided up and sold to separate entities.Denver Householder and City Directories, 1931 -86  The Tilden School for Teaching Health Historic District  The five buildings that made up the Tilden School for Teaching Health include the Bosler- Yankee House Administrative Building, the Patient Apartments Building, the Main Building, the Clinical Building and the Garage. The complex was listed on the National Register of Historical of Places on September 7, 1995 as the Tilden School for Teaching Health Historic District. The Bosler-Yankee House Administrative Building, the Patient Apartments Building, Main Building and associated grounds were designated Denver's 56th Historic District by a unanimous vote of Denver City Council on December 16, 2019. Bosler - Yankee Administration Building = The Bosler-Yankee House Administrative Building = The Bosler-Yankee House Administrative Building is located at 3209 West Fairview Place. It was designed and built by architect John G. Weller in 1882 as a single family house for Ambrose Bosler, a North Denver pioneer who made his money in the ice trade.Denver County Clerk and Recorder, Reception No. 1883900448 It is a rare example of a late Victorian Italianate style residence in North Denver. It occupies what would become the Southeast corner of the Tilden School campus. It is a two-story red brick structure with a rusticated stone foundation, sills and lintels. It has a third story square tower on the southeast facade. The building has an asymmetrical form with gabled and hipped projections, tall, narrow, one over one light double hung windows featuring segmented arches. The one-story porch partially wraps around the southern and eastern elevations.Visual observation by Paul C. Cloyd, Historical Architect/Professional Engineer, 2018 In 1890, Ambrose Bosler sold the house and the 6 lots to William Henry Yankee for $25,000.Denver County Clerk, reception number 1890944683 Yankee was born in 1840 in Sedalia, Missouri and moved to Denver in 1859. He enlisted as a 2nd lieutenant in the 23rd Missouri Volunteers for the Union. After being injured in the war, he resigned his commission and was discharged at the rank of Colonel. Eventually Yankee returned to Colorado and made his fortune in mining. In 1901, the Aetna Real Estate and Investment assumed ownership of the property.Denver County Clerk and Recorder Record, reception number 1901901859 In October 1914, Tilden purchased the home and the 6 lots from Aetna.Denver County Clerk and Recorder Record, reception number 1914094694 The home became the Administration Building for the Tilden School for Teaching Health. After the Tilden School closed in December 1931, the Bosler - Yankee House reverted to residential use. The house and the main building were purchased by Maude Offield in 1944. In 1946, the house was separated from the campus when it was purchased by Lorna Smith.Denver County Clerk and Recorder Record, reception number 1946231707 Just 6 months later, the house was sold to Kenneth P. Morris and his mother Gladys Morris.Denver County Clerk and Recorder Record, reception number 1947315024 City Directories suggest that in the years following Mr. Morris's death in November 1968, subsequent owners appeared to have rented the house out during much of the time up to the 1980s. The Bosler - Yankee House was designated an individual Denver Landmark (number 153) in 1984. In 1987, the house was purchased by Mr. Keith Painter. Due to an extended conflict with city hall over roof alterations and property rights, the Bosler - Yankee house fell into neglect. In May 2013, the City of Denver listed the building on the official Neglected & Derelict Building List. A $999 a day fine was levied for each day of inaction. The Bosler - Yankee House was foreclosed on by the City of Denver in May 2015 and subsequently purchased by Steve and Jan Davis in March 2016.Denver City and County Clerk and Recorder, reception # 2016036103 With grants from the National Trust for Historic Preservation and the Colorado Historic Fund to fund structure assessment and rehab design, the house underwent an extensive rehabilitation from 2016-2018. Patient Apartments Building No 1, c.1924-25 = The Patient Apartments Building = The Patient Apartments Building was the first of the five buildings to be designed and constructed specifically for the Tilden School. It was built in 1916 and is located north of the Bosler-Yankee House Administration Building at 3279 Grove Street.City and County of Denver, Building Permit Number 1033, 16 May 1916 It was designed by prominent Denver architect Harry W.J. Edbrooke. The Patient Apartments Building featured fully furnished apartments where patients could reside while learning Tilden's techniques to restore health. The building was designed in the Classical Revival Style and incorporated elements more commonly found in residential construction than medical facilities. The three story brick building has a hipped roof and a central circular two story portico. The building in approximately 100 feet in length and the front 40 foot portion is approximately 50 feet wide with the remainder of the building approximately 48 feet in width.Sanborn Insurance Company, \\"Sanborn Insurance Map Denver, Colorado,\\" extract, 1929-30Excerpt from WPA Map of Denver project 3831, Sheet HP22 completed 22 November 1940 After the Tilden school closed in 1931, the Patient Apartments Building became Highland Park Apartments.Tilden School Main Building (Building No. 2) = The Main Building = Harry Willoughby J. Edbrooke (1873-1946) The Main Building at 3249 West Fairview Place is the largest structure erected on the Tilden School for Teaching Health campus. The red brick craftsman style influenced structure was constructed in two stages.

The wings project 53 feet out from the spine and are 38 feet wide. The wings are separated by 76 feet. The original building footprint is approximately 13, 225 square feet and contained as many as 100 separate patient rooms, a lecture hall, dining hall, sun rooms, and other support spaces.Denver Building Permits #1441, dated 6/30/1919, #1584 dated 7/15/1919, and #4445 dated 10/1/1921 For a short time in the 1930s, the Main building was used to house 250 indigent elderly men by the Denver Emergency Relief Committee. From 1934 to 1939, it housed the Highland Park Hospital. From 1940 to the early 1970s it was the home of the Offield Convalescence Home. In the 1970s & 1980's the building was occupied by Carefree Guest Home and Highland Living. In 1995, plans began to convert the main building into 36 condo units under the name of Fairview Place Residences/Fairview lofts and demolition of interior non bearing walls began.Denver Building Permit #9546062, dated June 21, 1995 Attic space was converted to living space with the addition of dormers, entrances were changed and two exterior stair landings and an elevator tower were added.Architectural Drawings: Fairview Place Residences/Fairview Lofts Josh Comfort, 1998Clinical Building - Tilden School of Health, Denver, Colorado c. 1924 = Clinical Building = The Clinical Building is located at 3289 Grove Street and was also designed by Harry W. J. Edbrooke and erected by the Kirchhof Construction Company in 1923.City and County of Denver, Building Permit Number 6291, 7 December 1922. The classical revival style building was never equipped or furnished for clinical use and patients never lived there. It did house Arthur Vos and his family on the second floor when Vos operated the School from 1924 to 1931. The building is a three-story hipped roof structure composed of red and dark brown brick on the forward portion of the building and less expensive brick on the side elevations toward the rear and the back. It features a central, rounded, two story portico composed of round columns and squared engaged columns with Corinthian capitals. When the school closed, the clinical building remained vacant until 1935 when Highland Park Infirmary located there. From 1936 to 1938 the Industrial Clinic Hospital occupied the building. The Adult Blind Home occupied the building from 1940 to the early 1980s. The building is now used as a retirement and an assisted living facility known as Heather Grove. = Garage = The three car garage behind the Patient Apartments Building was the last building constructed while the Tilden School was in operation. The one story brick building was constructed in 1924 with a gabled roof with overhanging eaves and exposed rafters.City and County of Denver, Building Permit Number 2134, 22 April 1924. The garage has three sliding wooden garage doors on the southern elevation and one door on the eastern elevation. The rear of the building housed a tool room. = Grounds = When in operation, the grounds of the Tilden School for Teaching Health were landscaped with walking paths, a formal garden, a fish pond, and a flower garden that provided patients with fresh flowers. The wrought iron street lamps lining the property featured customized globes bearing the name \\"Tilden\\". Many of the trees that were planted during the School's operation have grown to maturity and still can be seen on the grounds.Fairview Tree Inventory 2018 sketch map prepared by David Boswell, Integrity Tree Service. = Location = The Tilden School for Teaching Health was located in the Highland Park subdivision of Denver, Colorado USA.

She was the first woman to stand in an election for the Edinburgh Town Council, when she ran in the 1907 election. Steel moved to South Africa in 1911 and at the beginning of World War I founded an organization to provide aid to South African soldiers and their families. She was honored as an Officer in the Order of the British Empire for her civil service. In addition, she served as president of the Women's Enfranchisement Association of the Union from 1916 until 1930, fighting for women's right to vote in South Africa. Early life Barbara Joanna Paterson was born in 1857 in St John's Town of Dalry, Kirkcudbrightshire, Scotland to Jane S. and Rev. Alexander A. Paterson. Her father was a United Presbyterian minister and her oldest brother James Alexander later became a Professor of Hebrew and Old Testament Exegesis at New College, Edinburgh. She was raised and attended school in Dalry until the 1880s, when she moved with her brother, James, to Newington, Edinburgh, where she continued her education. On 4 August 1883, Paterson married James Steel, a builder and property developer in Edinburgh. They made their home at 32 Colinton Road, Edinburgh, from the time of their marriage until James' death on 4 September 1904. Activism James was elected to local politics beginning in 1872, serving as the Liberal Councillor for the George Square Ward. From 1888 he served as Bailie and became Lord Provost of Edinburgh in 1900, serving until his retirement in 1903. From May 1903, when her husband was raised to the baronetcy of Murieston, Mid-Calder, Steel became known as Lady Steel. James was a property developer and built hundreds of buildings throughout the city. Steel was involved, like many women of her class, in social improvement projects. She encouraged James to build sanitary flats with indoor plumbing and potable water for the poor and working classes. Many of these apartments, located throughout the city in neighborhoods like Comely Bank, Dalry, Gorgie, Haymarket, Murieston Park, and Tollcross, had fixed rents. After her husband's death, Lady Steel became more involved in women's issues. Between 1904 and 1906, she served on the executive committee of the Scottish Women's Liberal Federation (SWLF), a women's branch of the Scottish Liberal Party. She also served on the Local Government and Women's Franchise committees of the SWLF and was a member of the Edinburgh National Society of Woman Suffrage. Lady Steel made international headlines from England to Australia and the United States in March 1907, when she refused to pay taxes without being allowed to vote. Her furniture was seized and sold to pay her tax bill. The same month, she led a protest at the Mercat Cross to demand women's suffrage. Later that same year, in October, she ran in the first town council meeting in which women were allowed to contest. On the eve of the election, a poem \\"The Suffragette's Nut Cracked\\" showing the conflict over votes for women and Steel's candidacy was published in the Edinburgh Evening Dispatch. Though she did not win a seat in the November election, because of her militant stance on taxation, she is remembered as \\"the first woman to stand for election to Edinburgh Town Council\\". In 1908 and again in 1909, Lady Steel continued her stance of refusing to pay taxes. By 1908, she was a member and one of the speakers for the Women's Social and Political Union's Edinburgh branch and participated in a discussion held at Bridge of Allan with Elizabeth Wolstenholme Elmy, Chrystal Macmillan and Jessie Methven about women's suffrage and higher education for women. In June 1908, she attended the Fourth Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance held in Amsterdam, as one of the alternate delegates. On 9 October 1909, she participated in the Great Procession and Women's Demonstration held in Edinburgh in support of women's enfranchisement. In March 1911, Lady Steel married Lt. Col. James Hyslop, D.S.O., and moved with him to his home in Pietermaritzburg, in the newly formed Union of South Africa. Hyslop was a fellow Scotsman from Kirkcudbrightshire, who had moved to the Colony of Natal in 1881 and worked there as a pioneer in mental health and as a military physician. At the onset of World War I, he became the director of medical services in the South African Medical Corps. Lady Steel served as the founder and chair of the Women's Patriotic League of Natal Province during the war. The organization served to support South African troops and provide necessary services for their families, such as medical supplies and clothing, to prevent over-taxing British organizations providing service in Europe. In 1918, she was honored as an Officer in the Order of the British Empire for her service. In 1916, she became the second president of the Women's Enfranchisement Association of the Union (WEAU), replacing Mary Emma Macintosh, who had recently died. The WEAU initially was formed on the advice on Carrie Chapman Catt in 1911 as an alternative to the Women's Enfranchisement League (WEL). The WEL had been divided by factionalism over the subject of race and Catt believed that the issue of race would delay granting women's suffrage. On her advice, the WEAU decided to ignore the issue of universal suffrage for all races, actively working only for the vote of white women. Lady Steel held the post of president from 1916 to 1930, when white women in South Africa finally secured enfranchisement.  Death and legacy Lady Steel died on 22 December 1943 at Pietermaritzburg and was buried at Stellawood Cemetery, in Durban, South Africa. In 2009, her role in the Scottish suffrage movement was celebrated along with other activists in the reenactment \\"Gude Cause\\" of the 1909 demonstration of Edinburgh.

From 1920 to 2004, it served as the headquarters of Spanish bank Banesto. After Banco Santander purchased Banesto, changed headquarters in 2004. Afterwards, the building stood empty and abandoned for several years.Palacio de la Equitativa In 2012, the building was declared as a cultural heritage monument. That same year, Santander sold the structure to construction company OHL, with plans to transform it into a luxury hotel.Palacio de la Equitativa In late 2013, extensive repairs, restoration and renovations began to transform the neglected building into a hotel. The building's protection status posed several challenges and caused construction delays. The hotel eventually became part of a ‚Ç¨530 million project that restored six additional buildings right next to the hotel.

(September 9, 1930 ‚Äì May 18, 2015) was an African- American Catholic monk, priest, and church historian at St. Meinrad Archabbey. He is known for his work on the history of African American Catholicism.  Biography  Davis was born with the name Clarence John in Washington, D.C. on September 9, 1930. He converted to Catholicism in his teenage years and became interested in joining the priesthood as well as becoming a monk. Though many monastic communities did not accept African Americans at the time, after high school, Davis joined the seminary of St. Meinrad Archabbey (1949‚Äì1956). He became a novice on July 31, 1950, took the monastic name Cyprian on August 1, 1951, and was ordained a priest on May 3, 1956. He became the first African American to join the monastic community of St. Meinrad. Davis received a S.T.L. from the Catholic University of America (1957), before going to the Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium to study church history, obtaining a licentiate (1963) and a doctorate (1977). Upon his first return from Belgium in 1963, he taught church history at St. Meinrad, and eventually became the school's first professor emeritus in 2012. During his studies in Belgium, Davis focused his work on the church during the middle ages to avoid American church history and concerns of race and slavery. However, returning to the United States in the midst of the civil rights movement, Davis attended the August 1963 March on Washington and heard Martin Luther King Jr. deliver his \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech. As a black Catholic professor, he began to be invited to speak in black parishes and was constantly asked about the place of African Americans in the Catholic church. He was involved in writing two pastoral letters on race, \\"Brothers and Sisters to Us\\" (1979) and \\"What We Have Seen and Heard\\" (1984), and later received a grant from the Lilly Endowment to the study the black church, resulting in the publication of his award-winning The History of Black Catholics in the United States (1990) Davis died on May 18, 2015 in Memorial Hospital in Jasper, Indiana, at age 84.

Former Chief Justice Gerard Brennan described judicial independence as existing \\"to serve and protect not the governors but the governed\\", albeit one that \\"rests on the calibre and the character of the judges themselves\\". Despite general agreement as to its importance and common acceptance of some elements, there is no agreement as to each of the elements of judicial independence. (2005) 2(1) University of New England Law Journal 75. Aspects of judicial independence can be seen as complementary, such as appeals serving to ensure that decisions are made on the facts and law, but which also serves to enhance public confidence in the judiciary. This however is not always the case as there are other elements that require balance, for example public confidence in the judiciary necessarily impacts on security of tenure in that it requires the ability to remove judges who are unfit for office. Similarly there may be tension between tenure of existing judges and the appointment of the best available candidate to a judicial position. The principle of judicial independence was not always observed in colonial Australia. (1995) 12 Australian Bar Review 181. [2013] 12 Macquarie Law Journal 21. Impartial The underlying principle is that a judge is an impartial decision maker, whether the parties are individuals, government or other corporate bodies, such that it is the \\"judge sitting on a case, who has heard the evidence and arguments, who makes the decision on the basis of an application of the law to the evidence and arguments presented\\". This carries with it the requirement that the judge is free from improper influences, whether from the parliament, executive or other powerful interest groups such as the media. The need for impartiality is reflected in the judicial oath ‚Äúto do right to all manner of people, according to law, without fear or favour, affection or ill will‚Äù. The need for public confidence in the impartiality of the judiciary, that \\"justice must be done and be seen to be done\\", gives rise to the rule disqualifying a judge where \\"a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide\\".. Initial principles The independence of the English judiciary is traditionally said to have been established by the Act of Settlement 1701 which made relevantly two provisions, that a judge's salary was required to be fixed on appointment and that the judge could only be removed by the crown on upon the address of both Houses of Parliament. These provisions did not apply to colonial judges, covered by the Colonial Leave of Absence Act 1782 (Imp),Colonial Leave of Absence Act 1782 22 Geo III 75. known as Burke's Act, which provided a judge could be removed by the Governor and Council of the colony, subject to the right of appeal to the Privy Council. (1953) 26 Australian Law Journal 462. =Immunity from suit= The common law of England has long held that a judge had immunity from being sued for any act within jurisdiction, even if the judge acted maliciously or corruptly. The courts have denied that rule exists for the protection of the malicious or corrupt judge,Scott v Stansfield (1868) 3 Law Reports (Exchequer) 220, Court of Exchequer (United Kingdom), per Kelly CB. and justified it on the grounds of the public interest in the independence of the judiciary as being necessary for the administration of justice.Anderson v Gorrie [1895] 1 QB 668, Court of Appeal (England and Wales) per Lord Esher MR at p 670.Sirros v Moore [1975] QB 118, Court of Appeal (England and Wales) per Ormrod LJ at p 145. The history of development of this immunity is complex, and the High Court held in 2006 that it is \\"ultimately, although not solely, founded in considerations of the finality of judgments\\". =Security of tenure= Security of tenure, leaving a judge free from influence resulting from the threat of removal, is generally said to be justified as an important feature of judicial independence. In the 1891 constitutional convention the protection required an address passed by the relevant houses of parliament. In Adelaide in 1897 the power to remove was limited to cases of \\"misbehaviour or incapacity\\", while in 1898 in Melbourne the convention added the requirement for proof, which Quick and Garran writing in 1901, said was to ensure that the judge should be heard in defence and that the charge had to be alleged in the address. In 1918 the High Court held that tenure must be for life to that particular court, not merely for a term of years.. Since the 20th century Australian judges accused of judicial misconduct can, generally, only be removed from office as a result of an address passed by the relevant houses of parliament, however the details vary. Some constitutions provide that a judge can only be removed on an address by parliament on specific grounds, being proved misbehaviour or incapacity. Judges' appointment, tenure, and remuneration. Removal from judicial office. Removal from office for misbehaviour or incapacity. Removal from judicial office. Similar provisions are found in legislation. Removal of judicial officer. Removal from office. Tenure of office. Legislation in the other states and territories, Removal from office of Judges . Tenure of judges and oaths of office. Judges removable only on address by Parliament. provide that a judge can only be removed on an address by parliament, but it is only by convention that the concept of good behaviour is limited to the grounds of incapacity or misbehaviour. (2003) 6(2) The Flinders Journal of Law Reform 169. [2016] Queensland Judicial Scholarship 20. There have been occasions in which judges have been removed by the abolition of their court. In 1878 the Governor of Victoria dismissed all judges of County Courts, Mines and Insolvency and all Chairman of General Sessions, as well as a large number of public servants. and only some, not all were subsequently reappointed. The Supreme Court held that County Court judges held office at pleasure and the Governor in council could remove them without cause.. More recent examples of courts being abolished without protecting the tenure of the judges are the abolition of the Court of Petty Sessions (NSW) and its replacement by the Local Court in which all but 6 magistrates were appointed to the new court,. and the abolition of the Victorian Accident Compensation Tribunal in 1992 by the Victorian government which by-passed the legislative removal mechanism and removed all judges. Twice sitting judges have been removed as a result of the introduction of a retirement age. In 1918 the NSW Parliament passed the Judges Retirement Act,. which introduced a compulsory retirement age of 70 which was applied to existing judges. The first judge to be affected was Richard Sly who had been appointed to the Supreme Court of NSW in 1908 and was forced to retire in 1920.McGarvie The Foundations of Judicial Independence in a Modern Democracy (1991) 1 Journal of Judicial Administration 3. More controversial was the similar action of the Queensland parliament in 1921 in passing the Judges Retirement Act.. There was animosity between the Labor government and the judges, playing out through a series of cases challenging government actions and legislation..In re McCawley [1918 62], Supreme Court (Full Court) (Qld). overturned by .Taylor v Attorney-General (Qld) [1918 194], Privy Council. (2006) 30(3) Melbourne University Law Review 605. The effect of the Judges Retirement Act was that immediately upon proclamation three out of six judges, Chief Justice Cooper and Justices Real and Chubb were compulsorily retired, which permitted the government to appoint new judges. =Remuneration= The principle that judicial salaries should be known, fixed at the time of appointment and cannot be reduced during tenure is well established at all levels in Australia. In 1877 the Supreme Court of NSW held that a statutory requirement that a judge's salary could not be reduced required the payment of the full salary, even when the judge had failed to perform duties, in that case attending court in various towns in the northern district. It also prevented the executive from claiming repayment of the cost of appointing a temporary replacement. In 1907 the High Court held that the imposition of an income tax payable by all taxpayers was not a reduction in the judge's salary.. One identified risk is that in real terms the remuneration may be continually cut by inflation. In 1954 the Judges of the Supreme Court of Victoria protested against what they said was the inadequacy of the increases proposed to be made to their salaries, under which the post- war inflation reduced the real value of their salaries. The High Court recognised the risk in 2004 stating that \\"There is no more effective means of depleting the substance of remuneration to an officeholder than by inattention on the part of the legislative or executive branch of government\\".. Subsequent developments =Separation of Powers= The theory that the legislative, executive and judicial powers should be separated is attributed to both French political philosopher Baron de Montesquieu and English judge Sir William Blackstone, although Blackstone only went so far as to state the necessity for some degree of separation of the administration of justice from both parliament and the executive. Despite the theory, historically there was no formal separation of the English judiciary: the Lord Chancellor was a member of cabinet, the presiding officer of the House of Lords and the head of the judiciary, the Law Lords in the House of Lords were the final court of appeal and some serving judges sat in the House of Commons. The drafters of the Australian constitution adopted the separation of federal judicial power,. whilst maintaining the approach of the Australian colonies that Ministers of State are required to be members of parliament. Ministers of State.. The High Court has consistently maintained two requirements of the separation of federal judicial power, (1) only a judge can exercise federal judicial power,... and (2) a federal court or judge could not exercise executive or legislative power... In this way the separation of powers prevents the courts from exercising legislative or executive power, by reference to issues that are non-justiciable., per Dixon CJ \\"it is for the courts to judge of the existence in either House of Parliament of a privilege, but, given an undoubted privilege, it is for the House to judge of the occasion and of the manner of its exercise\\". per Barton J \\"the could not be commanded to do an act which he can only do with the advice of the Executive Council\\". The High Court acknowledged in the 2014 decision of Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Barker, that the evolution of the common law involves a law making function, however the courts are constrained by deciding the particular case and complex policy considerations are matters more appropriate for parliament. The separation of powers is not a part of the constitutions of the States. Despite this the High Court has held that under the federal constitution state courts are repositories of federal judicial power, this gives rise to a requirement to maintain the institutional independence of state courts and judges. . . . . The Chief Justice of NSW, Tom Bathurst, speaking in 2013, argued that courts in Australia do not operate entirely independently of the executive and parliament, noting that (1) the role of the courts is to apply the laws made by parliament, (2) judges are appointed and can be removed by the executive; and (3) courts are funded by the executive. [2013] New South Wales Judicial Scholarship 39. The separation of powers has not been thought to prevent the appointment of High Court judges to executive roles, such as the appointment of Sir Owen Dixon to be the Australian Minister to the United States, and the appointment of Chief Justice Sir Garfield Barwick to the National Debt Commission. s 6 constitution of the Commission. Similarly numerous judges have been appointed to vice-regal roles, including the tradition of appointing High Court judges as deputies to the Governor-General for the opening of the first session of Parliament and the appointment of state judges, typically the Chief Justice, as Lieutenant-Governor or Acting Governor. The conferral of non- judicial functions on judges in their personal capacity, as opposed to their judicial capacity is referred to as the doctrine of persona designata. The doctrine does have limits and the High Court held in Hindmarsh Island Bridge case that the non-judicial function in that case was incompatible with judicial office.. More controversial was the advice being given to the Governor-General Sir John Kerr by Sir Garfield Barwick and Sir Anthony Mason during the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis. There have been various occasions in which a Governor-General or state Governor have sought the advice of a judge in relation to their powers, including Chief Justice Sir Samuel Griffith and Sir Edmund Barton advising both Lord Northcote and Sir Ronald Munro Ferguson; Sir Philip Street advising Sir Philip Game, the Governor of NSW, during the 1932 New South Wales constitutional crisis; Sir Owen Dixon advising Sir Dallas Brooks, the Governor of Victoria, in the 1950s.Twoomey, A \\"\\"The judiciousness of advising the Governor-General\\" (2012) 23(4) Public Law Review 241. Dixon also gave discreet advice to the US Consul and influential public servants. (1993) 21(2) Federal Law Review 151. =Appointment= There are three ways in which the appointment process has been thought to threaten judicial independence (1) political appointments (2) stacking the court with new appointments and (3) not appointing a sufficient number of judges for the workload. The power to appoint a judge lies exclusively at the discretion of the executive. This unfettered discretion gives rise to concerns expressed by Professor Blackshield that judicial appointments are political and made for political gain. Constitutional scholar Greg Craven argued that because High Court judges were appointed by the federal government, appointments were more likely to be made from lawyers who were sympathetic to a centralist point of view. Since 1979 the federal Attorney-General is required to consult with the Attorneys-General of the States in relation to the appointment of a judge to the High Court, Consultation with State Attorneys-General on appointment of Justices. however there is no requirement that consultation is reflected in who is appointed. Former Chief Justice Harry Gibbs argued that politics should not play a positive or negative part in the selection of judges. 17(3) Federal Law Review 141. Thirteen of the first thirty appointments to the High Court were serving or former politicians at the time of their appointment and appointments from either side of politics have been criticised as overtly political, such as the appointment of McTiernan, Evatt and Latham. Evatt was open about the policy considerations in his judgments. While Latham asserted the separation between law and politics, whether his decisions were consistent with that separation was open to question. Two prominent examples of the relevance of a judge having a centralist view are the appointment of Albert Piddington and the non-appointment of Sir Frederick Jordan. In 1913 Attorney- General Billy Hughes was looking to appoint judges to the High Court who took a broad view of federal powers and was accused of attempting to stack the High Court by increasing the number of judges from five to seven. Piddington was offered appointment after he had confirmed that he was \\"In sympathy with supremacy of Commonwealth powers\\", Piddington resigned from the High Court one month after his appointment following a strong media campaign against him. Jordan was considered a brilliant lawyer but was never appointed to the High Court, which Sir Owen Dixon described as a tragedy, hinting that it may have been due to his \\"queer views about federalism\\", a reference to Jordan's strenuous support for the power and rights of the States as against the Commonwealth. The appointment of a former politician is not always partisan, for example Robert McClelland a member of the Labor Party and former Attorney- General, was nominated for appointment to the Family Court by the Liberal‚ÄìNational government. Whilst he was Attorney-General, McClelland had implemented a process intended to achieve greater transparency that federal judges were appointed on merit, however these were never formalised through legislation and were abandoned by the new government in 2013. there were significant variations in Australia regarding the use of stated criteria, advertising, consultation and formal interviews in the appointment process. =Public confidence= Felix Frankfurter is reported to have said \\"The Court‚Äôs authority, consisting of neither the purse nor the sword, rests ultimately on substantial public confidence in its moral sanction\\", reflecting earlier comments in the essay Federalist No. 78 by Alexander Hamilton. Former Chief Justice Anthony Mason stated that judges highly value judicial independence and impartial decision making on the assumption that they are associated with public confidence in the judicial system generally, a value reflecting the judges' consciousness of the need to protect the authority of the courts and the spirit of obedience to the law. Mason questioned whether the public appreciates and values judicial independence as highly as judges do. The need to maintain public confidence in the judicial system has been stated as the foundation for a range of different rules and procedures, such as punishment for contempt of court, disqualification of a judge for the reasonable apprehension of bias, the process by which cases are allocated to a particular judge,Rajski v Wood (1989) 18 NSWLR 512 at 519, per Kirby P, Court of Appeal (NSW). and the need for judges to behave courteously in court.. Former Chief Justice Murray Gleeson questioned whether public confidence is a theoretical construct used to objectify judicial reasoning, stating that the foundational aspects of judicial independence are not matters of wide interest. Gleeson suggests that public confidence may consist of taking things for granted rather than reasoned opinion. Other considerations =Misconduct not warranting removal= Gleeson has stated that in his experience as President of the Judicial Commission of NSW the difficult cases were those in which the misconduct would not justify removal of the judge, noting that the Chief Justice or head of jurisdiction had the capacity to advise, warn and take appropriate administrative steps, but beyond that were unable to penalise another judge. One option was to move the judge to other duties or another location. After Jeffrey Bent was removed as a judge in NSW, he was appointed Chief Justice of Grenada. Similarly John Willis had previously been removed as a judge in Upper Canada following a clash with Sir Peregrine Maitland. He spent time in British Guiana before accepting a post to NSW. In Sydney Willis clashed with Chief Justice Sir James Dowling. Governor Gipps appointed Willis to the position of Resident judge for the District of Port Phillip. There was no less conflict in Melbourne, where Willis clashed with the press, the legal fraternity, and members of the public and he was removed by Governor Gipps. (1972) 8(4) Melbourne University Law Review 703. A different approach was taken with Frederick Meymott, a judge of the District Court of NSW in 1876. Over a number of years Meymott had failed to attend various courts in the northern district. The Executive Council thought that removal was too harsh a penalty and decided to admonish and reprimand Meymott, with the controversy being limited to the unsuccessful attempt to reduce his salary by the amount of additional expense incurred to replace him.Meymott v Piddington [1877 Knox's Reports 306]. 70 years later in 1952 County Court of Victoria judge Len Stretton was sent a written rebuke for his remarks that he \\"would not punish people trying to live decent lives in the degradation of emergency housing camps if the State did not want to do anything to help them\\", referring to the camp in Watsonia. Cowen and Derham argued that the only power was to remove a judge for misconduct and the independence of the judiciary meant it was improper for the executive to admonish a judge. An administrative measure that has been taken is in relation to the allocation of work. Examples include: *James Staples was a deputy president of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, with the same rank and status as a Federal Court judge. Staples was isolated within the commission and the duties he was allocated were significantly reduced from 1979. He was not allocated any duties between 1985 and the abolition of the commission in 1988. (1995) 12 Australian Bar Review 181. (1989) 31 Journal of Industrial Relations 334. * In 2013, shortly after Anne Bampton's appointment to the Supreme Court, she was driving after consuming alcohol when she hit and injured a cyclist at Glenside. Bampton pleaded guilty to driving with excess blood alcohol and driving without due care. Bampton did not resign nor did the Parliament seek her removal. The Chief Justice Chris Kourakis decided that for twelve months Bampton would not be allocated to cases involving a driving offence nor where an offender was \\"materially affected by alcohol\\". * Garry Neilson, a NSW District Court judge, was found by the Judicial Commission of NSW to have made comments that undermined confidence in the judiciary, and amounted to inappropriate judicial conduct. The Commission recommended that Neilson not be allocated to sit on cases involving sexual offences. * In 2018 Victorian Magistrate Richard Pithouse was charged with failing to stop after an accident. Whilst he was awaiting charges he was removed from hearing traffic matters and criminal cases. While Pithouse acknowledged his wrongdoing, no conviction was recorded as he was placed on the Court's diversion program for first-time offenders and returned to full duties. There are limits to the extent to which administrative measures can address inappropriate judicial conduct. Greg Borchers, a judge of the Local Court (NT) and Youth Justice Court (NT) had been found by Chief Judge Lowndes to have engaged in inappropriate judicial conduct when sentencing a 13-year-old boy in Tennant Creek. Chief Judge Lowndes decided that the appropriate response was that Borchers should not be allocated to the Youth Justice Court in Alice Springs. There were however only 4 magistrates in Alice Springs to cover a circuit of 10 courts and in each town the same judge would sit as the Local Court and the Youth Justice Court. Thus the only ways to avoid Judge Borchers sitting in the Youth Justice Court in those towns were either he did not go on circuit, increasing the workload on the other 3 judges or 2 of the 4 judges would need to travel to each town so that the other judge could hear youth matters. Chief Judge Lowndes decided that Judge Borchers would continue to sit on youth matters on circuit, including in Tennant Creek where the complaint arose. =Incapacity= In relation to NSW Local Court Magistrate Jennifer Betts, the Judicial Commission held that incapacity extended beyond physical or mental incapacity caused by an identifiable disorder, referring to examples of alcoholism, drug dependency, senility or debilitating illness, to include \\"incapacity to discharge the duties of judicial office in a manner that accords with recognised standards of judicial propriety\\". Thus incapacity requires knowledge of what the judicial officer is required to do and the circumstances under which those duties must be performed.Bruce v Cole (1998) 45 NSWLR 163 at 195, Court of Appeal (NSW). One of the features of Magistrate Maloney's case was that it was revealed in 2011 that he had previously been the subject of complaints before the Conduct Division in 1999, which resulted in him giving an undertaking ‚Äúnot to be too loquacious, not to interrupt solicitors, not to introduce matters reflecting his personal experiences, to be more judicial and to allow matters to run their course without interfering‚Äù, matters similar to the complaints dealt with in 2011. The concern in Magistrate Maloney's case was not that he would be unfit while he was undergoing treatment, but rather what happened if he stopped. Similarly the issues with Magistrate Betts appears to have arisen in the times in which she stopped taking her medication. The difficulty with supervision of judicial officers was highlighted by the judgment of Hoeben J in the Supreme Court in relation to Magistrate Maloney: > 119\\\\. ... it is inherent in the judicial function that the sort of > supervisory constraints which the evidence identified as appropriate to > those in the medical profession with a bipolar 2 condition, could not be > applied to judicial officers. The principle of judicial independence would > simply not allow it. Most particularly a performance assessment and > oversight by other medical practitioners would not be possible in the case > of a judicial officer. > 120\\\\. ... An undertaking not to engage in loquaciousness etc (the 1999 > undertaking) or to provide judgments on time (Justice Bruce) are very > different to a commitment to work under supervision by another judicial > officer, the terms of which were never identified and which of its nature > seems to be inconsistent with judicial independence.. The Judicial Commission of NSW thought, in relation to Magistrates Betts and Maloney, that there was no alternative to their removal. The Legislative Council however disagreed. =Financial and administrative autonomy of the courts= More controversial is the proposition that reliance on funding from government for the operation of the courts is itself a threat to the independence of the judiciary. The United Nations basic principles only goes so far as the duty to \\"provide adequate resources to enable the judiciary to properly perform its functions\\". Principle 7. Writing in 1991 Justice McGarvie of the Supreme Court of Victoria asserted that judicial independence required that the judges must control the premises, facilities, staff and budget of their court. A contrary view was expressed by Church and Sallman who noted that executive administration of the courts had not prevented the judiciary in Australia from maintaining independence for a considerable time. =Performance indicators= The use of statistics and performance indicators as a measure of the performance of courts and judges is controversial. In 2013 Chief Justice Bathurst identified the way in which this performance is measured as one of the most substantial risks to the separation of powers. In 1994 the Federal Court rejected an attempt to argue that the relatively high number of appeals against decisions of a particular person as a measure of apprehended bias.. In 2016 the Full Court of the Federal Court rejected, as irrelevant to an apprehension of bias, evidence that Judge Sandy Street found in favour of the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection in 99.21% of matters he decided. In 2018 the Australian Financial Review published a series of articles comparing the time Federal Court judges took to deliver judgments and the number of paragraphs per day. In the 2018 Victorian state election the Liberal Party campaigned on a platform that they would publish data on court performance including sentencing records, sitting times and successful appeals.
