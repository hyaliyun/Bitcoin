Product history Clearblue home pregnancy test system 1985 Clearblue was introduced in 1985 with the launch of the first Clearblue Home Pregnancy Test system, which at the time was owned by Unilever. It was the world’s first “rapid home test” that gave pregnancy test results in 30 minutes and allowed a woman to take a test before going to the doctor. The test was a three-step process using a dipstick and small tray. In 1988, Clearblue launched the first one-step pregnancy test with the invention of lateral flow technology. This one-step test gave a result in 3 minutes, subsequently reduced to a 1-minute result when Clearblue introduced the world’s first one- minute home pregnancy test in 1996. In 2003, Clearblue released the first digital pregnancy test to show the result in words ‘Pregnant’ or ‘Not Pregnant’ on a digital screen. Clearblue Advanced Digital Pregnancy Test with Weeks Estimator In 1989, Clearblue released the first one-step home ovulation test, enabling women to measure their surge in Luteinising Hormone (LH) to determine their most fertile days. In 1999, the brand launched the world’s first dual-hormone fertility monitor, which allowed women to measure estrone3-glucuronide (estrogen) in combination with LH. The company created the first digital ovulation test in 2004. In 2013, the company also began offering an ovulation test with a dual hormone read detecting both estrogen and LH. Clearblue Digital Ovulation Test with Dual Hormone Indicator Clearblue won the 2012 Red Dot Design Award in the product design category for its Clearblue Plus Pregnancy Test. The Clearblue Digital Ovulation test was the 2011 Platinum winner in the Prima Baby Reader Awards. Clearblue is a donor to Flight for Every Mother Ltd, a humanitarian project led by Dr. Sophia Webster which aims to improve maternal health in Africa. Corporate history Unilever’s diagnostics subsidiary, Unipath, was sold to Inverness Medical Innovations Group in 2001, later renamed Alere.

Schmitt studied education at Harvard University, taught briefly at Colorado Rocky Mountain School and Millbrook School, before founding Thomas More School in Harrisville, New Hampshire in 1959. Mr. Schmitt also taught at Thomas Aquinas College in California from 1974-1979. The School is named for the trivium, the first three liberal arts (Grammar, Logic, and Rhetoric). The students follow a unified curriculum that includes college preparatory studies with an emphasis on the intellectual virtues. The curriculum is influenced by the ideas of Mortimer J. Adler, Sister Miriam Joseph, and Dorothy L. Sayers in that its stated purpose is to develop the \\"tools for learning\\" instead of simply teaching subjects. The stated mission also includes the use of the Socratic method with small classes and a low student-teacher ratio. Students are required to participate in studios of music, visual arts, and drama and sing in the School chorus.

The festival was the first organized in an Arab country, as well as the first in Africa and brought together 11,000 delegates from over 100 countries from around the world. International preparatory meetings took place in Cuba, India, Cyprus and Algeria itself. The event came after the successful revival of the festival movement at the 14th World Festival of Youth and Students in Havana, Cuba, and marked a continuation of the internationalist and anti-imperialist youth festival spirit.  From the call to the festival  > The international festival’s movement initiated in the beginning of 1947 > offered to the youth of the world a space of free expression around their > preoccupations and a forum of solidarity with people searching for > independence, for self determination and for development. Humanity is > entering the 21st century with hopes and new aspirations, but it has to face > at the same time great challenges, being aware that not all of the last > centuries changes changed our lives for the better; rather, it depends on > our youthful, common and joint struggle as an active power of peoples. The > 15th edition of the World Festival of Youth and Students comes to strengthen > the work of the last festivals, and will take place in a new millennium > marked by disastrous effects of globalisation and the new restructuring of > the international relations, under the slogan adopted by a consensus “Let us > globalise the struggle for peace, solidarity, development, against > imperialism”. This 15th WFYS also plays a great role in an era where the > civil society at the international level has become an undeniable partner in > taking decisions thanks to multi-form struggles led by Non Governmental > Organisations which lay down them selves as a real ways and means of > claiming and expressing the preoccupations of the different stratum of > peoples.  Political unrest  The festival took place at the conclusion of the decade-long Algerian Civil War. In the months leading up to the festival there were sustained street actions by hundreds of thousands of working people and youth in Algeria protesting repression by national police forces and supporting the struggle by the indigenous Berber people, an ethnic nationality in Algeria and throughout North Africa, for the right to be taught in their native language in school. This led to some groups to call to boycott the festival from those communities.  Delegations  Over 1,000 youth from Algeria itself attended the festival including 50 students of Berber origin and whose families live in Kabylia, a region to the east of Algiers where Berbers comprise the overwhelming majority. A number of other countries from Africa sent significant delegations, including Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen, Sudan, Egypt, and Tunisia, a first time in the history of the WFYS. A large delegation of over 400 people came with the Polisario Front from Western Sahara who raised the issue of their ongoing conflict with Morocco, organizing solidarity tents, dinners, rallies, workshops, and cultural activities about the issue which created thousands of refugees in that country. Almost 1,000 youth were expected from the Americas with Cuba sending a delegation of 600, the largest from the region. This included 250 international students who were then going to school in Cuba, especially from Latin America, the Caribbean, and Africa; the other 350 were Cuban students and young workers. Several hundred came from Venezuela, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, the United States and Puerto Rico. The final count for the festival was 11,000 although other sources put the event at 6,500 people.  Stamp  To honour the festival, Algeria released a special stamp by artist and painter Djazia Cherrih featuring the logo of the youth festival.  Activities  Most of the events were held at the Université des sciences et de la technologie Houari- Boumediene. Political themes of the conferences included peace, security, international co-operation; self-determination, sovereignty, national liberation, solidarity; democracy; development and the environment; employment; education, science, and technology; childhood; women; health; communication and culture; racism, neo-fascism and discrimination; youth's movements; the students' movement; human and peoples' rights. The Festival aimed to be an open forum for young people to exchange experiences, work together for alternative solutions, and establish joint programs of action on a wide range issues. Topics of discussion and themes of debates included disarmament and building a nuclear-free world, the \\"New World Order\\" and NATO, as well as neo-liberal globalisation. One day of the festival was devoted to solidarity with the people of Puerto Rico, especially the fight to get the U.S. Navy out of the island of Vieques, which was then being used as a bombing range and testing ground by the navy and United States Navy in Vieques, Puerto Rico. A combined forum in solidarity with the struggles of the people of Cuba, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, and Colombia also took place. The panel included María Pili Hernández, representing the youth of the Fifth Republic Movement of Venezuela, the party founded by Hugo Chávez. She described changes in Venezuela's constitution and other measures by the Chávez government as an alternative example, a \\"third road,\\" in the fight against imperialism. Also discussed were questions like the eradication of racism, gender equality, HIV/AIDS and drug abuse. For example, the event featured a joint WFDY - UNESCO Conference on \\"the Role of Young Women in promoting culture of peace in Africa\\". The festival also took place on the occasion of the 35th anniversary of the founding of the Organization of Caribbean and Latin American Students (OCLAE), who noted that the student federations represented in OCLAE and at the 15th world youth festival are part of an emerging anti-imperialist youth movement that is revitalizing the organization. Cultural activities at the festival included a series of amateur tournaments, including football, basketball, handball, a wheelchair competition, a chess match, tennis and table tennis. A series of festivals were also held including of political song, modern music, dance and mime, traditional folklore, and of film-makers.

He was rector of Aberdare from 1846 until 1859. From 1859 until his death in 1885 he was vicar of Merthyr Tydfil where he proved a strong supporter of workers' rights and, by the end of his life a supporter of the disestablishment of the Church of England in Wales. This reflected the way in which he gradually abandoned the strong Tory principles that he espoused at the beginning of his career at Aberdare. He died on 24 April 1885. Early life and career Griffith was born in 1818 or 1819 in Llanbadarn Fawr, Cardiganshire, the son of Thomas Griffith. He commenced his education at Ystradmeurig School, which was a popular choice amongst the gentlemen farmers of Cardiganshire for educating their sons. He proceeded to Swansea Grammar School and Christ's College, Cambridge, he was ordained a priest in 1843. After a short period as curate of Astbury in Cheshire, Griffith benefitted from the patronage of Sir Stephen Glynne, brother-in-law of W.E. Gladstone, and for a short time became family chaplain at Hawarden. However, a collapse in the family finances in 1846 made it necessary for Griffith to seek alternative employment. At this time, Griffith had been writing to the Cardiff and Merthyr Guardian, using the pseudonym, Cambro Sacerdos, and in these articles drew attention to deficiencies that still existed within the church despite reforms undertaken in the 1830s. The articles came to the attention of the owner of the newspaper, the Marquis of Bute. Bute was not only an evangelical and supporter of church reform but also, as Lord Lieutenant of Glamorgan, concerned about the preservation of law and order within the developing industrial communities in the upland parts of the county. Under these circumstances, Griffith emerged as a candidate for the vacant parish of Aberdare which was endowed by the Marquis. John Griffith at Aberdare The parish of Aberdare was established in 1846 when it ceased to be part of the pre-industrial parish of Llantrisant, many miles to the south. The new parish was a large one, extending from Hirwaun in the north to Mountain Ash in the south, an area of some fifty square miles centred on the town of Aberdare. The whole area was expanding rapidly due to the opening of ironworks and collieries, with the population increasing by approximately 1,000 people each year. The only Anglican place of worship was the small and ancient St John's Church, while there were already at least fourteen substantial nonconformist chapels in the parish. It was only towards the end of his ministry at Aberdare that St John's Church became suitable for regular worship once again after a restoration costing £900. By that time however, Griffith had instigated the building of St Elvan's Church, commonly known as the Cathedral of the Valleys, which revitalised the influence of the Church in this industrial community. However, his initial impact on the parish did not attract a positive response. Soon after his arrival at Aberdare, Griffith became embroiled in the controversy over the 1847 Education Reports following evidence he gave to the commissioners about the alleged immorality of the local population., p.489 He later elaborated upon or repeated his claims in letters to the press, such as that published in the Cardiff and Merthyr Guardian in February 1848. On that occasion, Griffith argued that he merely repeated what had been said for many years by David Owen (Brutus) in the Anglican journal, Yr Haul. This provoked fury form local nonconformist ministers led by the Rev Thomas Price and it has been argued that this episode enabled Price to assume the leadership of political nonconformity in Aberdare and further afield. However, he soon proved to be a more complex figure than the caricature attacked by Price. In late 1848 he criticised his own church's apparent indifference towards the Welsh-speaking population, most clearly seen in the appointment of monoglot Englishmen to ecclesiastical posts in Wales. While at Aberdare he sought to expand the activities of the established church in the parish Aberdare, commencing services at Hirwaun and building St Fagan's Church, Trecynon. He also sought to improve the conditions of the working classes in the town, and sought to establish a mechanics’ institute, a reading room and lending-library. He also inaugurated a series of public lectures. John Griffith at Merthyr Tydfil Griffith's move to Merthyr Tydfil saw him take over a much larger and more established parish than Aberdare. In 1859, Merthyr was affected by the Religious Revival which affected much of Wales, and Griffith supported the movement although it was primarily associated with nonconformity. He became less than popular with the church authorities, however, as a result of his support for disestablishment. In July 1883, he stated that ‘I have been for years convinced that nothing but Disestablishment, the separation of the Church from the State, can ever reform the Church in Wales.’ Griffith's funeral was said to have been attended by between 12,000 and 15,000 people 'I venture to declare', wrote one correspondent, ' no man in this part of the kingdom could be more popular in his day and generation than the Rev. John Griffith.' Among the nonconformist ministers present at the funeral was his old rival, Dr Thomas Price of Aberdare.

It features musical performances and interviews about Spoon's troubled childhood, raised by Pentecostal parents obsessed with the Rapture and an abusive father, as well as Spoon's past experiences with gender confusion. The film was shot in the Canadian Prairies, including the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology in Drumheller. My Prairie Home was produced by Lea Marin for the National Film Board of Canada (NFB). McMullan has said she first found out about Spoon around 2007, when she was making a western-themed NFB film set in the B.C. Interior. She was searching for \\"subversive\\" country-folk soundtrack music when someone suggested Spoon. According to Spoon, the idea for the documentary came out of a discussion with McMullan in 2010 about the musician's perceived lack of marketability, a criticism Spoon sometimes receives when applying for music video funding.

The book is an oral biographical portrait of reclusive American author J. D. Salinger. It explores Salinger's life, with emphasis on his military service in World War II, his post-traumatic stress disorder, his subsequent writing career, his retreat from fame, his religious beliefs and his relationships with teenage girls. Salinger debuted at #6 on the New York Times bestsellers list and stayed on the list for three weeks. It was #1 on the Los Angeles Times bestsellers list. Additionally, Salinger was named to the bestsellers lists for NPR, Independent Booksellers, and Barnes & Noble. It was named the Amazon Best Book of the Month in September 2013, received starred reviews from Kirkus Reviews and Publishers Weekly, and was chosen as a Book of the Month Club Selection and the History Book Club Selection for September 2013. The accompanying documentary Salinger was featured as the 200th episode of American Masters on PBS.  Background  On January 29, 2013, The New York Times announced Simon & Schuster acquired the biography. Jonathan Karp, the publisher at Simon & Schuster, stated: \\"We are honored to be the publisher of what we believe will be the foundational book on one of the most beloved and most puzzling figures of the 20th century. Many of us who read The Catcher in the Rye have, at some point in our lives, wished we could know the author better. Now, we finally can.\\" Salinger is the 17th book by David Shields and the first book by author, screenwriter, and producer Shane Salerno. Salerno's interest in Salinger began when, as a child, he read all of Salinger's published work and learned that the author had retreated from public life to live in a rural town in New Hampshire, where he ostensibly wrote every day yet vowed never to publish again. Salerno began researching Salinger's life and, after beginning production on his documentary film Salinger, felt there was too much information for the film. This resulted in the book, which took 10 years to complete and entailed over 200 interviews on five continents.  Response  Scott Bowles in USA Today gave Salinger 3 ½ out of 4 stars: \\"Eloquently written and exhaustively reported... Salinger is an unmitigated success... There's no denying that Shields and Salerno have struck journalistic gold. Salinger is a revelation, and offers the most complete picture of an American icon, a man deified by silence, haunted by war, frustrated in love—and more frail and human than he ever wanted the world to know.\\" Lev Grossman of Time said Salinger \\"presents a decade's worth of genuinely valuable research... there are riches here... Salinger doesn't excuse its subject's personal failings, but it helps explain them: in his fiction, Salinger had a chance to be the good, untraumatized man he couldn't be in real life.\\" John Walsh of The Sunday Times (London) called the book \\"A stupendous work.\\" David Ulin of Los Angeles Times wrote, that \\"Salinger gets the goods on an author's reclusive life... it strips away the sheen of his exceptionalism, trading in his genius for something much more real.\\" Associated Press said Salinger was \\"thoroughly documented... Providing by far the most detailed report of previously unreleased material, the book... both fleshes out and challenges aspects of the author's legend.\\" Tina Jordan of Entertainment Weekly gave the book a grade of B-, saying that \\"the reminiscences are layered with a stunning array of primary material…taken as a whole—the memories, the documents, the pictures—the book feels as close as we'll ever get to being inside Salinger's head,\\" while also writing that the book is \\"a bit of a shambling, unwieldy mess.\\" Kirkus Reviews called it a \\"thoroughly revealing biography,\\" stating that \\"Shields and Salerno chase down the story in minute detail.\\" Laura Miller in Salon said that the book is \\"refreshingly frank about their subject's many shortcomings and how they might have affected his work... Salinger amply documents the author's youthful arrogance and selfishness, his infatuation with his own cleverness and his inability to see the world from the perspective of anyone who wasn't a lot like himself.\\" Jeff Simon wrote in Buffalo News that this is a \\"now-irreplaceable book about the greatest enigma of modern American literature... Salinger can't tell 'all' about its subject but it tells more than we've ever known before... a complex but well- constructed narrative composed of fragments of history, anecdote and commentary.\\" Tucker Shaw in The Denver Post called the book \\"an exhaustively detailed portrait of the famously reclusive novelist J. D. Salinger.\\" Carl Rollyson in The Wall Street Journal wrote that while the book was \\"engrossing,\\" it \\"is biography as scrapbook, chock-full of well-known figures and well-worn stories.\\" Rollyson said that Salinger \\"would be more fun if it had an index, so that the dopey parts could be skipped.\\" He concluded, \\"Salinger also never comes together as a story for readers\\" and suggested that \\"the raw material in Salinger will need to be digested by yet another biographer... We have waited so long to understand J. D. Salinger. We must wait longer.\\" In The New York Times, Michiko Kakutani thought that the authors had done \\"an energetic job of finding sources and persuading them to talk\\" but the books's \\"Internet-age narrative\\" and \\"sloppy scholarship,\\" made it \\"a sprawling, cut-and-paste collage.\\" Writing in London Guardian, Sam Leith said that the volume contained \\"new and fascinating nuggets\\" and \\"isn't worthless.\\" But he summarized it as \\"vast, silly, boastful, prurient, intellectually incoherent and basically philistine\\" and \\"a frustrating hodgepodge.\\" \\"[M]uch of what is in here has no real bearing on Salinger's works themselves,\\" wrote Martin Rubin in The Washington Times, \\"and is simply yet another contribution to what Joyce Carol Oates pungently termed pathography.\\" Rubin also wrote that the book was \\"well-presented and valuable…consistently interesting.\\" Louis Bayard of The Washington Post wrote that \\"the book offers the most complete rendering yet of Salinger's World War II service, the transformative trauma that began with the D-Day invasion and carried through the horrific Battle of Hürtgen Forest and the liberation of a Dachau subcamp.\\" But he criticized many other elements of the book, writing, \\"It contains no index. Its end notes are seriously incomplete. Its passing errors (names are misspelled more than once) suggest a book that has been rushed to market. The absence of connective prose tissue leaves the pages echoing with voices and countervoices and no clear way to distinguish between them.\\" Pat Padua in Seattle Post-Intelligencer described the book as \\"terrible,\\" specifying it as \\"badly edited, poorly conceived, and at times embarrassingly written.\\" In Los Angeles Review of Books, Cornel Bonca found Salinger to be \\"stuffed with lots of good raw information\\" and marked by a \\"clear, often compelling narrative.\\" But overall, Bonca found that the \\"bloated\\" and \\"ham-fisted\\" book was \\"an elaborate cut-and-paste job\\" that constituted \\"a savage and somewhat revengeful disembowelment.\\" Andrew Romano of The Daily Beast wrote \\"Salinger is full of fascinating revelations\\" though after its \\"breathless attempts\\" to explain its subject, \\"I still didn't have a handle on what Salinger was like.\\" The average review score for the book on Amazon is 3.6 out of 5 stars, indicating positive reviews.

The semi-legendary Roman histories tell that while the king was away on campaign, his son Sextus Tarquinius raped a noblewoman, Lucretia. Afterwards she revealed the offence to various Roman noblemen, and then committed suicide. The Roman noblemen, led by Lucius Junius Brutus, obtained the support of the Roman aristocracy and the people to expel the king and his family and to institute a republic. The Roman army supported Brutus, and the king went into exile. Despite a number of attempts by Lucius Tarquinius Superbus to reinstate the monarchy, the citizens established a republic and thereafter elected two consuls annually to rule the city. Background: The Kingdom Roman history held that seven kings of Rome reigned from the establishment of the city in 753 BC by Romulus up to the reign of Tarquinius. The accuracy of this account has been doubted by modern historians, although it appears to be accepted that there was a monarchy, and the last king Tarquinius was expelled upon the founding of the republic in the late 6th century BC. Tarquinius was the son of the fifth king, Lucius Tarquinius Priscus. In around 535 BC Tarquinius, together with his wife Tullia Minor (one of the daughters of the then king Servius Tullius) arranged the murder of Servius. Tarquinius became king in his place. Despite various military victories, Tarquinius became an unpopular king. He refused to bury his predecessor, then put to death a number of the leading senators whom he suspected of remaining loyal to Servius (one of whom was the brother of Lucius Junius Brutus). By not replacing the slain senators, and not consulting the Senate on all matters of government, he diminished both the size and authority of the Senate. In another break with tradition, he judged capital criminal cases without advice of counsellors, thereby creating fear among those who might think to oppose him. He also engaged in treachery with the Latin allies. Rape of Lucretia Titian's Tarquin and Lucretia (1571) In about 510 BC, Tarquinius went to war with the Rutuli. According to Livy, the Rutuli were, at that time, a very wealthy people and Tarquinius was keen to obtain the spoils that would come with victory over the Rutuli in order, in part, to assuage the anger of his subjects.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 1.57 Tarquinius unsuccessfully sought to take the Rutulian capital Ardea by storm, and subsequently began an extensive siege of the city. Sextus Tarquinius, the king's son, was sent on a military errand to Collatia. Sextus was received with great hospitality at the governor's mansion, home of Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus, son of the king's nephew, Arruns Tarquinius, former governor of Collatia and first of the Tarquinii Collatini. Lucius' wife, Lucretia, daughter of Spurius Lucretius, prefect of Rome, \\"a man of distinction\\",D.H. IV.64. made sure that the king's son was treated as became his rank, although her husband was away at the siege. In a variant of the story,T.L. I.57. Sextus and Lucius, at a wine party on furlough, were debating the virtues of wives when Lucius volunteered to settle the debate by all of them riding to his home to see what Lucretia was doing. She was weaving with her maids. The party awarded her the palm of victory and Lucius invited them to visit, but for the time being they returned to camp. At night Sextus entered her bedroom by stealth, quietly going around the slaves who were sleeping at her door. She awakened, he identified himself and offered her two choices: she could submit to his sexual advances and become his wife and future queen, or he would kill her and one of her slaves and place the bodies together, then claim he had caught her having adulterous sex (see sexuality in ancient Rome). In the alternative story, he returned from camp a few days later with one companion to take Collatinus up on his invitation to visit and was lodged in a guest bedroom. He entered Lucretia's room while she lay naked in her bed and started to wash her belly with water, which woke her up. Uprising Brutus holding the knife and swearing the oath, with Lucretia The next day Lucretia dressed in black and went to her father's house in Rome and cast herself down in the suppliant's position (embracing the knees), weeping. Asked to explain herself she insisted on first summoning witnesses and after disclosing the rape, called on them for vengeance, a plea that could not be ignored, as she was speaking to the chief magistrate of Rome. While they were debating she drew a concealed dagger and stabbed herself in the heart. She died in her father's arms, with the women present keening and lamenting. \\"This dreadful scene struck the Romans who were present with so much horror and compassion that they all cried out with one voice that they would rather die a thousand deaths in defence of their liberty than suffer such outrages to be committed by the tyrants.\\"D.H. IV.66. In the alternative version, Lucretia summoned Lucius Junius Brutus (a leading citizen, and the grandson of Rome's fifth king Tarquinius Priscus), along with her father Spurius Lucretius Tricipitinus, another leading citizen Publius Valerius Publicola, and her husband Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus (also related to Tarquinius Priscus) to Collatia after she had been raped. Lucretia, believing that the rape dishonored her and her family, committed suicide by stabbing herself with a dagger after telling of what had befallen her. According to legend, Brutus grabbed the dagger from Lucretia's breast after her death and immediately shouted for the overthrow of the Tarquins.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 1.58–59 The four men gathered the youth of Collatia, then went to Rome where Brutus, being at that time Tribunus Celerum, summoned the people to the forum and exhorted them to rise up against the king. The people voted for the deposition of the king, and the banishment of the royal family.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 1.59 Brutus summoned the comitia curiata, an organization of patrician families used mainly to ratify the decrees of the king and began to harangue them in one of the more noted and effective speeches of ancient Rome. He began by revealing that his pose as fool was a sham designed to protect him against an evil king. He leveled a number of charges against the king and his family: the outrage against Lucretia, whom everyone could see on the dais, the king's tyranny, the forced labor of the plebeians in the ditches and sewers of Rome. He pointed out that Superbus had come to rule by the murder of Servius Tullius, his wife's father, next-to-the-last king of Rome. He \\"solemnly invoked the gods as the avengers of murdered parents.\\" The king's wife, Tullia, was in fact in Rome and probably was a witness to the proceedings from her palace near the forum. Seeing herself the target of so much animosity she fled from the palace in fear of her life and proceeded to the camp at Ardea. Brutus opened a debate on the form of government Rome ought to have; there were many speakers (all patricians). In summation he proposed the banishment of the Tarquins from all the territories of Rome and appointment of an interrex to nominate new magistrates and conduct an election of ratification. They had decided on a republican form of government with two consuls in place of a king executing the will of a patrician senate. This was a temporary measure until they could consider the details more carefully. Brutus renounced all right to the throne. In subsequent years the powers of the king were divided among various elected magistracies. A final vote of the curiae carried the interim constitution. Spurius Lucretius was swiftly elected interrex (he was prefect of the city anyway). He proposed Brutus and Collatinus as the first two consuls and that choice was ratified by the curiae. Needing to acquire the assent of the population as a whole they paraded Lucretia's body through the streets, summoning the plebeians to legal assembly in the forum. Once there they heard a further speech by Brutus. It began:D.H. IV.78. A general election was held. The vote was for the republic. The monarchy was at an end, even while Lucretia was still displayed in the forum. Brutus, leaving Lucretius in command of the city, proceeded with armed men to the Roman army then camped at Ardea. The king, who had been with the army, heard of developments at Rome, and left the camp for the city before Brutus' arrival. The army received Brutus as a hero, and the king's sons were expelled from the camp. Tarquinius Superbus, meanwhile, was refused entry at Rome, and fled with his family into exile.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 1.59–60 Establishment of the republic The Capitoline Brutus, an ancient Roman bust from the Capitoline Museums is traditionally identified as a portrait of Lucius Junius Brutus That uprising resulted in the exile or Regifugium, after a reign of 25 years, of Tarquinius and his family, and the establishment of the Roman Republic, with Brutus and Collatinus (both related by blood to Rome's fifth king Lucius Tarquinius Priscus) as the first consuls. Tarquinius and his two eldest sons, Titus and Arruns, went into exile at Caere.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 1.60 According to Livy, Brutus' first act after the expulsion of Lucius Tarquinius Superbus was to bring the people to swear an oath (the Oath of Brutus) never to allow any man again to be king in Rome.Livy, Ab urbe condita, ed. R. S. Conway & C. F. Walters (Oxford, 1914), 2.1.9. : Omnium primum avidum novae libertatis populum, ne postmodum flecti precibus aut donis regiis posset, iure iurando adegit neminem Romae passuros regnare. : First of all, by swearing an oath that they would suffer no man to rule Rome, it forced the people, desirous of a new liberty, not to be thereafter swayed by the entreaties or bribes of kings. This is, fundamentally, a restatement of the \\"private oath\\" sworn by the conspirators to overthrow the monarchy:Livy, \\"Ab urbe condita\\" 1.59.1. : : By this guiltless blood before the kingly injustice I swear – you and the gods as my witnesses – I make myself the one who will prosecute, by what force I am able, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus along with his wicked wife and the whole house of his freeborn children by sword, by fire, by any means hence, so that neither they nor any one else be suffered to rule Rome. There is no scholarly agreement that the oath took place; it is reported, although differently, by Plutarch (Poplicola, 2) and Appian (B.C. 2.119). Brutus also replenished the number of senators to 300 from the principal men of the equites. The new consuls also created a new office of rex sacrorum to carry out the religious duties that had previously been performed by the kings.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 2.1–2 Because of the Roman people's revulsion at the name and family of the exiled king, the consul Tarquinius Collatinus was forced to resign from the office of consul and go into exile. Attempts to reinstate the monarchy After his exile, Tarquinius made a number of attempts to regain the throne. At first, he sent ambassadors to the Senate to request the return of his family's personal effects, which had been seized in the coup. In secret, while the Senate debated his request, the ambassadors met with and subverted a number of the leading men of Rome to the royal cause, in the Tarquinian conspiracy. The conspirators included two of Brutus' brothers-in- law, and his two sons Titus and Tiberius. The conspiracy was discovered, and the conspirators executed.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 2.3–5 Although the Senate had initially agreed to Tarquin's request for a return of his family's effects, the decision was reconsidered and revoked after the discovery of the conspiracy, and the royal property was given over to be plundered by the Roman populace.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 2.5 Tarquinius next attempted to regain Rome by force of arms. He first gained the support of the cities of Veii and Tarquinii, recalling to the former their regular losses of war and land to the Roman state, and to the latter his family ties. The armies of the two cities were led by Tarquinius against Rome in the Battle of Silva Arsia. The king commanded the Etruscan infantry. Although the result initially appeared uncertain, the Romans were victorious. Both Brutus (the consul) and Arruns (the king's son) were killed in battle.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 2.6–7 Another attempt by Tarquinius relied on military support from Lars Porsenna, king of Clusium. The war led to the siege of Rome, and finally a peace treaty. However, Tarquinius failed to achieve his aim of regaining the throne.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 2.9–15 Tarquinius and his family left Clusium, and instead sought refuge in Tusculum with his son-in-law Octavius Mamilius.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 2.15 In about 496 BC, Tarquin and his son Titus fought with Mamilius and the Latin League against Rome, but lost, at the Battle of Lake Regillus at which Mamilius perished. Subsequently, Tarquinius fled to take refuge with the tyrant of Cumae, Aristodemus and Tarquin died there in 495 BC.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 2.21 References Category:509 BC Category:6th-century BC conflicts Category:6th century BC in the Roman Kingdom Category:Rebellions in ancient history Category:Democratization Category:Coups d'état Category:Revolutions ","title":"Overthrow of the Roman monarchy"},{"id":"40998424","text":"Dunay () in Iran may refer to: * Dunay-e Olya * Dunay-e Sofla ","title":"Dunay, Iran"},{"id":"40998488","text":"Lynda Chin (born 1968) is a Chinese-American medical doctor.

Miron (23) is not interested in politics, he thinks his friends from the democratic opposition make just a bunch of daydreamers. However, the \\"independent\\" rock group's next rock concert triggers public anti-regime demonstrations. Miron pays for these events by being forcibly drafted into the army despite his heart disease. In his unit, Miron comes face-to-face with inhumane conditions and indoctrination in the Soviet spirit. In protest, Miron, with the support of his beautiful and tireless girlfriend Vera, publishes blog ‘Life of a Conscript' on the Internet. The blog portrays the army as a miniature of contemporary Belarus, and its citizens as 'conscripts', subject to informal hierarchies and indoctrination, sparking a real storm in the Internet. Miron uses extracts from the blog in satirical songs which slam the regime and become street hits. The authorities decide to hit the rebel in his most sensitive spot...

She creates dances and sculpture that involve crutches for people of all abilities. She identifies herself as a disabled person. Life Cunningham was born with osteoporosis, a progressive bone disease and as result she labels herself as disabled. She lived in Ayrshire, but now lives in Glasgow. She has created work with the National Theatre of Scotland. Claire Cunningham is one of the UK’s most esteemed disabled artists. Cunningham’s work challenges normativity and explores the potential for experimental dance techniques. Her work, as a choreographer, is conscious of the non-normative body and the societal implications of living a disabled experience. Cunningham works in multiple art forms including intimate solo shows to large ensemble work. Her 2014 dance \\"Give Me a Reason to Live\\" is based on the depiction of \\"cripples\\" in the work of the Dutch painter Hieronymus Bosch. She dedicated this work to protest at the British cuts to funding and the Nazi Euthanasia Programme. Works include  * Guide Gods \\"Guide Gods\\", performed in the Church of Our Lady & St. Nicholas, as a part of Dada Fest, was developed through a research trip to Cambodia. There Cunningham was exposed to the ideas of reincarnation and also the dated idea that disability is punishment for sins committed in a previous life. The resulting piece seeks to bridge a gap between cultural ideas and the shared human experience. It combines interviews with religious leaders, music, and Cunningham’s unique experience. * Give me a Reason to Live “Give me a Reason to Live,” is a 2015 dance based on the artwork “ The Garden of Earthly Delights,” by the Dutch medieval painter Hieronymous Bosch. The piece is in protest against British funding cuts. This piece explores the role of empathy, religion, and the judgment of bodies and souls. * The Way You Look (at me) Tonight created with Jess Curtis and Dr Alva Noë “The Way You Look at Me Tonight,” is a choreographed duet with Cunningham’s long time collaborator, Jess Curtis. The piece is performed as a tutorial in how to deal with age, ability, sexuality and the intersection of gender. In one act of the dance Cunningham and Curtis perform on crutches and sing a Scottish Hymn atop a ladder. *ME (Mobile/Evolution) (2009) “ME (Mobile/Evolution)” is a solo performance where she creates a spectacle of her mobility from the ground. Treating her crutches like old friends, she takes the audience on a journey of their history and “slowly begins to build them into a swinging mobile structure” * 12 *Beyond the Breakwater \\"Beyond Breakwater\\" is an on-site, seaside, performance that explores the 'choreography of work' and the multi-use of crutches. Cunningham uses the crutches in her piece as a 'sculpture' allowing for the spectacle to be viewed over the passing of time. * Thank You Very Much \\"Thank You Very Much\\" is a choreographed performance that explores the question, \\"What does it mean to try and learn to move like someone else?\\". Cast is dressed as a sea of Elvis Presley impersonators pelvic-thrusting and gyrating rebelliously while celebrating their imperfections. * Resemblance (2014) \\"Resemblance\\" is a solo performance centering around Cunningham mirroring the assembly of a crutch as a soldier would a gun. This ritualistic statement piece was performed in a series of short films called 'World War 1 Shorts: Does It Matter?'. * Ménage Á Trois (2013) “Ménage Á Trois” is an intimate piece about loneliness, love and the manipulation of her crutch. Through the use of dance theatre, Cunningham depicts a story of a woman constructing her perfect male companion from the one thing she relies on daily, her crutch. Both a clever metaphor for a companion and an everyday item she relies on, she explores the question, “Is it possible to find love when there are already three of you in the relationship”. Collaboration Jess Curtis is an experimental dancer based out of California.

The four block district reflects popular architectural styles of the mid-19th through mid-20th century. History Plainfield, Illinois was founded in August 1834 by Chester Ingersoll, who platted a town just north of the 1828 settlement of Walkers Corners. That December, Levi Arnold bought the land directly north of Ingersoll's and began to subdivide it; this area would later become the historic district. The construction of the Illinois and Michigan Canal in the 1840s brought new residents to Plainfield, as the canal headquarters was only east in Lockport. Lockport Road connected the two settlements and became an important thoroughfare once the canal opened in 1848. Plainfield was also a convenient stop for travelers going between Chicago and Ottawa. Most early development was residential, but by the late 1840s, a concentration of commercial developments began to organize at the junction between Ingersoll and Arnold's plats. Isaiah Clippinger subdivided his property for commercial use on the south side of Lockport Street between Des Plaines and Illinois Streets. The DuPage Inn and Tavern was one of the first major commercial ventures, located about where 24216 Lockport Street is now.http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/feature/places/pdfs/13000719.pdf Standard Oil Gasoline Station is a contributing property to the district. The Village of Plainfield was formed in 1869 when the northern and southern sections decided to unite; it was incorporated in 1877 with a population around 700. Most commercial structures were wood-framed and were destroyed during a series of four fires from 1888 to 1899. Development in the ensuing decades was prompted by Plainfield's location on an important transportation corridor. In 1904, the Aurora, Plainfield & Joliet Railway provided interurban service between these three cities and located their maintenance shop at 24216 Lockport Street. Lincoln Highway, which passed through town via Lockport Street, was designated in the late 1920s as the first transcontinental highway for automobiles, promoting auto-related commercial development in Plainfield. The Standard Oil station at the southwest corner of Des Plaines and Lockport is the best surviving remnant of the era.

Used between 1827 and 1963, it was later demolished and the site turned into a park on the banks of the Connecticut River. History Connecticut opened the Wethersfield State Prison in September 1827 as a replacement for the decrepit Old Newgate Prison, which had begun as a copper mine. Although the prisoners had no longer been housed in the former mine galleries by that point, the above-ground facilities were inadequate for the state's need. 127 inmates were shackled together and marched the 20 miles from East Granby to Wethersfield.Marlene Clark, \\"A Prison Where 73 Inmates Were Executed\\", The Hartford Courant (Hartford, CT) 13 February 2008, accessed on 27 October 2013 The new prison was intended to be state of the art and was modeled after the Auburn State Prison in New York.Connecticut State Library, Wethersfield Prison Records, Connecticut State Library, 1999, http://www.cslib.org/wethers.asp, accessed on 27 October 2013 Wethersfield State Prison not only followed the physical model of Auburn, but it also followed the harsh Auburn System of prisoner control until 1900.Christopher Hoffman, \\"Historical Exhibit Tells Tale Of Wethersfield Prison, And Its Inmates\\", The Hartford Courant (Hartford, CT) 19 July 2013, accessed on 27 October 2013 Prisoners were required to march in lockstep, forbidden from all talking, and expected to work to support the prison.

The prison was built on 44 acres at the edge of Wethersfield Cove and the grounds included the 1774 Solomon Welles House, used as the Warden's residence. Beginning as a single building, over the course of its 136-year history many more buildings and workshops were constructed until it became a \\"hodgepodge\\" of ill-matched structures within the surrounding walls. All executions carried out by the state of Connecticut between 1893 and 1960 took place at this prison.

Contributions to Wesleyan Theology=Responsible Grace The publication in 1994 of Responsible Grace: John Wesley’s Practical Theology established Maddox as one of the foremost interpreters of the Wesleyan tradition. Maddox's work in Responsible Grace is noteworthy in aligning John Wesley's theological concerns related to the doctrine of salvation with themes characteristic of the Eastern (or Greek) Christian tradition. According to Maddox, the Western juridical tendencies in Wesley's theology (sin as guilt, grace as pardon, and salvation as being from the penalty of sin) are couched in a larger framework that owes more to an Eastern therapeutic view (sin as disease, grace as power for healing, salvation as being from the plague of sin).Randy L. Maddox, Responsible Grace (Nashville: Kingswood Books, 1994), 73-87 and 143-145. In advancing this view of Wesley's doctrine of salvation, Maddox emphasizes the importance of sanctification within Wesley's conception of the via salutis (or “way of salvation”) as an ongoing form of spiritual maturation or growth.On the argument for using via salutis over the similar term ordo salutis, see Maddox, Responsible Grace, 157-158. Maddox also brings clarity to the understanding of Wesley's theological method by describing his approach as guided by an abiding “orienting concern.” He names this orienting concern as “responsible grace,” a term that sums up many of the major dynamics of Wesley's doctrine of grace as they relate to God's initiative in salvation and the human response to God. He describes the concept of responsible grace as “an abiding concern to preserve the vital tension between two truths that [Wesley] viewed as co-definitive of Christianity: without God’s grace, we cannot be saved; while without our (grace-empowered, but uncoerced) participation, God’s grace will not save.”Maddox, Responsible Grace, 19. The Nature of Practical Theology and John Wesley as Practical Theologian Beyond its interpretation of Wesley's soteriology, Responsible Grace also identifies John Wesley as a “practical theologian.” Maddox developed this idea for several years prior to the publication of Responsible Grace, having become convinced that the traditional dismissal of Wesley's theological writing within the academy was the result of a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of his work.See, e.g., Randy L. Maddox, “John Wesley—Practical Theologian?” Wesleyan Theological Journal 23 (1988): 122-147. Cf. Randy L. Maddox, “Reclaiming an Inheritance: Wesley as Theologian in the History of Methodist Theology,” in Rethinking Wesley’s Theology for Contemporary Methodism, ed. Randy L. Maddox (Nashville: Kingswood Books, 1998), 213-226. Rather than judging Wesley according to the canons of systematic theology, Maddox argues that he ought to be seen as engaging in practical theology—which he defines as a form of reflection that seeks “to unify the various theological concerns (tradition, Scripture, experience, reason, etc.) around the common focus of norming Christian praxis.”Randy L. Maddox, “The Recovery of Theology as a Practical Discipline,” Theological Studies 51 (1990): 665. From this understanding of the nature of practical theology, Maddox subsequently posited the notion of the “orienting concern” as the way in which consistency in theological claims is measured.Maddox, “The Recovery of Theology as a Practical Discipline,” 669-672. In interpreting Wesley as a practical theologian, Maddox suggests that he resembles the early church fathers of the first few centuries of the Christian era (rather than the systematic theologians of the 19th and 20th centuries).“When his work is considered as a whole, Wesley’s theological activity is analogous to the early Christian approach to theology per se as a practical endeavor” (Maddox, “John Wesley—Practical Theologian?” 130). Wesley's theology is occasional and contextual, geared to address specific challenges and problems of the Christian life. It is typically expressed in genres such as sermons, liturgies, hymns, pastoral letters, catechetical works, and doctrinal essays.Randy L. Maddox, “Reading Wesley as a Theologian,” Wesleyan Theological Journal 30:1 (Spring 1995): 26-39. Maddox argues that such theological activity ought not be seen as a lower or less important expression of theology than the highly technical theology of the modern academy. Rather, practical theology as Maddox describes it is the most characteristic mode of theology in that it is intimately connected to Christian worship and the life of discipleship.Maddox, “Reclaiming an Inheritance: Wesley as Theologian in the History of Methodist Theology,” in Rethinking Wesley’s Theology for Contemporary Methodism, 225. Reading Wesley as a theologian in this guise means engaging Wesley's theology on its own terms—as a type of serious theological reflection engaged with the context and practice of the Christian life. Holistic Salvation In recent years Maddox has advanced the understanding of Wesley's doctrine of salvation as it pertains to bodily health and wholeness.See, e.g., Randy L. Maddox, “John Wesley on Holistic Health and Healing,” Methodist History 46:1 (October 2007): 4-33. Modern day readers of Wesley's Primitive Physick—a manual of medical advice and folk remedies for common illnesses—often view many of its suggested “cures” as humorous. Maddox, on the other hand, has emphasized the way in which Wesley's concern for bodily health is reflective of his understanding of salvation as intended for human life in the present and as encompassing both body and soul. For Wesley, Maddox argues, the reason one would take care of one's physical health is intimately related to God's desire to save whole persons.“Q&A; with Randy Maddox,” Faith & Leadership (July 31, 2012), Online publication of Leadership Education at Duke Divinity School (LEADD).

Maddox also emphasizes the way in which the Wesleyan concern for holistic salvation influenced Wesley's eschatological views as well, which has consequences both for his understanding of the New Creation as well as the place of the animal kingdom within it.Randy L. Maddox, “Reclaiming Holistic Salvation A Wesleyan Agenda for the 21st Century,” Response 26:3 (Summer 2003).

The Wesley Works Project & The Center for Studies in the Wesleyan Tradition Beginning in 1960, Methodist scholars began pursuing the development of a comprehensive and critical edition of John Wesley's corpus of writing.“Detailed Description of the Bicentennial Edition of the Works of John Wesley,” Center for Studies in the Wesleyan Tradition at Duke Divinity School. Online at: (accessed November 1, 2013). Currently housed in the Center for Studies in the Wesleyan Tradition at Duke Divinity School, the Wesley Works Editorial Project is engaged in the publication of a projected 35-volume edition of the Bicentennial Edition of the Works of John Wesley.Wesley Works Editorial Project homepage: http://divinity.duke.edu/initiatives-centers/cswt/wesley-texts/wesley-works- editorial-project (accessed November 1, 2013). Abingdon Press is serving as the publisher for the series. In 2003, Maddox was named as the Associate General Editor for the Wesley Works Project. He also serves as a fellow of the Center for Studies in the Wesleyan Tradition. In his capacity as the Associate General Editor, Maddox has editorial oversight of the individual volumes currently in research or production. He has personally edited Doctrinal and Controversial Treatises I in 2012, which is Volume 12 in the series and covers aspects of the theological stance of John Wesley in the area of soteriology.“New Books from Duke Divinity Faculty,” Divinity Magazine 12:2 (Spring 2013). Online at: (accessed November 6, 2013). For his work on this volume, Maddox received the 2013 Saddlebag Selection Award from the Historical Society of the United Methodist Church, given to \\"the outstanding book on United Methodist history or a related subject published during a given year.\\"\\"Saddlebag Selection of the Historical Society of the United Methodist Church,\\" The Historical Society of the United Methodist Church website: http://www.historicalsocietyunitedmethodistchurch.org/publications/saddlebag.php (accessed December 4, 2013).\\"General Commission on Archives and History Hosts 2013 HSUMC Annual Meeting,\\" Historian's Digest 53:4 (Fall 2013): 3. Maddox's role as a fellow in the Center for Studies in the Wesleyan Tradition has also included significant historical work with Charles Wesley's poetry and hymnody. A five-year project under Maddox's leadership was completed in 2012 that successfully compiled all the known verse from Charles Wesley's pen, both published and unpublished. This comprehensive collection of Charles Wesley's hymns and poems is the first of its kind and is intended to serve as a resource both for the study of Charles Wesley's theology and the hymnody of the Methodist tradition.Mary Jacobs, “Charles Wesley’s works amassed online,” United Methodist Reporter (June 3, 2012). Online at: http://unitedmethodistreporter.com/2012/06/03/charles-wesleys-works-amassed- online/ (accessed November 1, 2013). Theology for the Church While Maddox's scholarly work has primarily been focused on the interpretation of John Wesley and the later Methodist tradition (and so falls under the heading of historical theology), he has also consistently attempted to translate that work as a resource for contemporary Christian practice.Among numerous other examples, see Randy L. Maddox, \\"Wesley's Prescription for 'Making Disciples of Jesus Christ'—Insights for the 21st century Church,\\" Quarterly Review 23:1 (2003): 15-28; and Randy L. Maddox, \\"The United Methodist Way: Living the Christian Life in Covenant with Christ and One Another,\\" available at: http://methodistthinker.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/united-methodist-way- maddox-et-al.pdf (accessed November 6, 2007). In this sense, Maddox serves as one of the standard bearers for the \\"neo-Wesleyan revival\\", which features renewed interest in the theology of John Wesley and the practices of early Methodism amongst Methodists and other Wesleyans from the 1960s to the present.See, e.g., Andrew C. Thompson, \\"Wesleyan evangelism is worth understanding,\\" United Methodist Reporter 158:47 (March 23, 2012). Notable Influences Maddox studied under Theodore Runyon at Emory University, a notable Wesleyan theologian and the author of The New Creation: John Wesley’s Theology Today.Theodore Runyon, The New Creation: John Wesley’s Theology Today (Nashville: Abingdon Press, 1998). Runyon was the Emeritus Professor of Systematic Theology at Emory University's Candler School of Theology.Theodore Runyon Abingdon Press Author Page: http://www.abingdonpress.com/theodore_runyon (accessed November 3, 2013). Many aspects of Maddox's interpretation of Wesley are developments of themes originally identified by Albert C. Outler (1908-1989), the influential Methodist ecumenist, theologian, and church leader of the 20th century. Some of these include the identification of Wesley as a “folk theologian,”Albert C. Outler, “Towards a Re-Appraisal of John Wesley as a Theologian,” in The Wesleyan Theological Heritage: Essays of Albert C. Outler, ed. Thomas C. Oden and Leicester R. Longden (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1991), 43-44. the conviction that Wesley can be seen as a theological mentor for contemporary Christian practice,Albert C. Outler, “John Wesley as Theologian: Then and Now,” in The Wesleyan Theological Heritage: Essays of Albert C. Outler, 57-58. the conviction that Wesley's theology bears strong resembles to the Eastern Christian tradition,Albert C. Outler, ed., John Wesley (New York: Oxford University Press, 1964), 9-10. and the methodological construct known as Outler's Quadrilateral.See Andrew C.

It is the only species in the genus Hoplocypode. Gulf ghost crabs are medium-sized, reaching a maximum overall body diameter of . They are one of only two ghost crab species found in the eastern Pacific (the other being the painted ghost crabs). However, gulf ghost crabs can easily be distinguished from painted ghost crabs by the absence of \\"horns\\" on their eyes. Taxonomy Hoplocypode occidentalis was first described by the American marine biologist William Stimpson in 1860 as Ocypoda occidentalis. The type specimens were originally collected from Cabo San Lucas, Baja California, Mexico. It was transferred to its own genus Hoplocypode in 2013 by Katsushi Sakai and Michael Türkay based on the differences of their gonopods (appendages modified into copulatory organs) from that of the rest of the members of the genus Ocypode. It is classified under the ghost crab subfamily Ocypodinae in the family Ocypodidae. The specific name is from Latin occidentalis (\\"western\\"). They are commonly known as the \\"gulf ghost crab\\" in English and cangrejo de playa in Spanish. Description Gulf ghost crabs are medium-sized ghost crabs with deep bodies, reaching a maximum overall body diameter of . The upper surface of the body is generally dark gray with lighter colored marbling. The underside of the body, the tips of the walking legs, and the claws are creamy white. Their coloration varies, usually matching the color of the sand surrounding them, but they are easier to see on black volcanic sand and on light-colored dry sand. leg of a gulf ghost crab by Edward J. Miers: He incorrectly identified it as Ocypode kuhlii (which is only found in Southeast Asia). The carapace is squarish in shape and wider than it is long, with a length around and a width of . It is thickly covered with rough, small bumps (tubercles). Their eyestalks are large and elongated, but do not possess \\"horns\\" as in some other ghost crab species. The outer half of margins of the eye sockets curve distinctly inwards, with the outer edges (exorbital angles) triangular in shape with a sharp, forward-facing, pointed end. Like other ghost crabs, one of the claw appendages (chelipeds, the first pereiopod pair) of gulf ghost crabs is much bigger than the other. The palm of the larger cheliped is elongated with a serrated lower edge and covered with tubercles on the upper surface. It features stridulating (sound-producing) ridges on the inner surface of the palm, which is important for identifying different species within the subfamily Ocypodinae. In gulf ghost crabs, the stridulating ridge is short and composed of a row of 21 to 22 tubercles. The smaller cheliped tapers towards a pointed end. The second pair of walking legs are not more than two and a half times the length of the carapace. The fourth pair is relatively smaller and weaker in comparison to the other three pairs, reaching only to the middle of the propodus of the third pair. The mera and carpi of all the legs are naked, but the propodi possess fur-like bristles (setae) on for the first three walking leg pairs varying by sex. In males, the propodi of the first and second pair of walking legs have their upper forward surfaces covered with setae. The propodi of the third pair of walking legs only have setae on the upper margin of the propodi. In females, the propodi of the third and last pair of walking legs do not possess bristles on the upper surfaces of their propodi. The first gonopods (modified copulatory organs) of males are also distinctively complex in shape, with a triangular cross-section at the base and becoming hoof-like towards the end. This characteristic is one of the diagnostic criteria for the genus. The covering (operculum) of the genital duct of the females has four sides and is membranous and slightly calcified. The genital slit is narrow and aligned along the middle of the operculum. Ecology Gulf ghost crabs live in burrows near the intertidal zone of open sandy beaches and on sand and silt banks near where river mouths empty into the sea. Larger individuals usually have burrows further up the shore, while smaller individuals are closer to the waves. They are nocturnal, emerging from their burrows just after sunset. They are fast-moving generalist scavengers and predators, usually feeding on decaying bodies of fish and other crustaceans. They are also devastating predators of eggs and hatchlings of sea turtles, including the olive Ridley sea turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea) and the leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea). In Playa Grande, Costa Rica, they've been observed to be responsible for as much as 48% of the total number of deaths in freshly hatched sea turtles crossing the beaches towards the water. Distribution Gulf ghost crabs are native to the eastern Pacific coast of the Americas, from the Gulf of California to Colombia. They are sympatric with the painted ghost crab (Ocypode gaudichaudii), and juvenile specimens of the two smaller than are very difficult to tell apart. However, the adults are readily distinguishable, as painted ghost crabs are brightly colored and possess \\"horns\\" (styles) on their eyestalks which are absent in gulf ghost crabs. Painted ghost crabs also prefer sheltered rocky beaches, while gulf coast crabs are found on open sandy beaches.

Summary Christy de la Cruz is a twenty-nine-year-old interior designer who has recently divorced her husband, Zach, after he told her he was gay. After struggling on the dating scene she makes a prayer to the Virgen de Guadalupe asking her to send her three attractive men. Later, at a family barbecue, her cousin Maggie re-introduces Christy to Bathlazar Reyes, a former neighbour who tormented Christy when she was an overweight child, and his two cousins, Melchior and Caspar. The three cousins are named after the Biblical Magi as a tribute to their last name, Reyes. Maggie suggests that since Christy is now attractive and single all three men take her on three dates at the end of which Christy will decide which one of them she wants to continue dating. The three men agree as does Christy despite her misgivings. As she begins to date the three men, Christy reconnects with Maggie and the rest of her family to whom she had grown estranged due to her ex-husband and her financial success.

Life She was born while her mother was on tour in England in 1829. She was the daughter of George Thomson, merchant, by his wife Peggy Cook, an actress, whose aunt, Sarah West, enjoyed a high position on the stage. At an early age, she accompanied her parents to Australia, and at eight, as a child singer and dancer, earned a reputation as a prodigy. In 1845, she was playing at the Victoria Theatre, Melbourne. In June 1846, at Trinity Church, Launceston, Tasmania, she was married to Charles Frederick Young, a comedian. She supported G. V. Brooke, the well-known actor, during his Australian tour of 1855, appearing with him as Beatrice in Much Ado About Nothing, Emilia in Othello, Pauline in The Lady of Lyons, and Lady Macbeth. Early career As Mrs. Charles Young, she made her first appearance on the London stage under the management of Samuel Phelps, at Sadler's Wells Theatre, on 15 September 1857, playing Julia in The Hunchback. She was welcomed with enthusiasm as an accomplished interpreter of the poetic and romantic drama. During the seasons of 1857 and 1858, she played most of the leading parts in Phelps's productions, making striking successes as the Princess of France in Love's Labour's Lost, Rosalind in As You Like It, Clara Douglas in Money, Portia, Desdemona, Fanny Stirling in The Clandestine Marriage, Imogen, Cordelia, Mrs. Haller in The Stranger, Mistress Ford in The Merry Wives of Windsor, Lydia Languish in The Rivals, Lady Mabel Lynteme in Westland Marston's Patrician's Daughter, Pauline in The Lady of Lyons, Virginia in Virginius, Mrs. Oakley in George Cohnan's The Jealous Wife, Lady Townley in Vanbrugh and Cibber's The Provoked Husband, Viola in Twelfth Night, Constance in King John, and Juliet. During the summer vacation of 1858 she had appeared at the Haymarket Theatre, and Lyceum Theatre, playing at the former house the Widow Belmour in Murphy's The Way to Keep Him on 10 July, the last night of Buckstone's five years continuous \\"season\\". In March 1859, she appeared at the Lyceum under Benjamin Webster and Edmund Falconer. At the opening of the Princess's Theatre under the management of Augustus Harris, senior (24 September), she rendered Amoret in Ivy Hall, adapted by John Oxenford from Le Roman d'un Jeune Homme Pauvre; Henry Irving made his first appearance on the London stage on this occasion. Mien Phelps reopened Sadler's Wells Theatre, under his sole management, on 8 Sept. 1860, Mrs. Young appeared as Rosalind, acting for the first time with Hermann Vezin [q. v. Suppl. II], who appeared as Orlando. She remained with Phelps through the season of 1860–61, adding the parts of Miranda in The Tempest and Donna Violante in The Wonder to her repertory. Her chief engagement during 1861 was at the Haymarket Theatre, where on 30 September she played Portia to the Shylock of the American actor Edwin Booth, who then made his first appearance in London. In May 1862 she obtained a divorce from Young, and on 21 February 1863, at St Peter's Church, Eaton Square, she was married to Hermann Vezin, whom she at once accompanied on a theatrical tour in the provinces. Afterwards she played with him in Westland Marston's Donna Diana at the Princess's Theatre on 2 January 1864. On the tercentenary celebration of Shakespeare's birthday at Stratford-on-Avon, in April 1864, she acted Rosalind. There followed a long engagement at Drury Lane Theatre, under F. B. Chatterton and Edmund Falconer. There she first appeared on 8 October 1864 as Desdemona, in a powerful cast which included Phelps as Othello and William Creswick as Iago. She repeated many of the chief parts she had already played at Sadler's Wells, adding to them the Lady in Milton's Comus (17 April 1865), Marguerite in Bayle Bernard's Faust (20 October 1866), in which she made a great hit; Helen in The Hunchback, with Helen Faucit as Julia (November 1866); and Lady Teazle in The School for Scandal (4 March 1867). At the Princess's Theatre, on 22 August 1867, she gave a very beautiful performance of the part of Peg Woffington in Charles Reade's Masks and Faces. Again with Phelps at Drury Lane, during the season of 1867–68, she played Lady Macbeth (14 October 1867); Angiolina in The Doge of Venice (2 November); and Charlotte in The Hypocrite (1 February 1868). Less important London engagements followed: at the St. James's Theatre, on 15 October 1870, she was highly successful as Clotilde in Fernande, adapted from the French by Henry Sutherland Edwards, and on 4 March 1871 as Mrs. Arthur Minton in James Albery's comedy, Two Thorns. Tours During March 1874 she toured in the chief provincial cities with her own company, playing parts of no great interest. At Drury Lane Theatre she reappeared under F. B. Chatterton as Lady Elizabeth in Richard III (Cibber's version) (23 September 1876), as Lady Macbeth (22 November), as Paulina in The Winter's Tale, with Charles Dillon (28 September 1878), and later in the season as Emilia in Othello and as Mrs. Oakley in The Jealous Wife. She subsequently joined the company at the Prince of Wales's Theatre in Tottenham Court Road, under the management of the Bancrofts, appearing on 27 September 1879 as Lady Deene in James Albery's Duty, an adaptation from Sardou's Les Bourgeois de Pont Arcy. She again supported Edwin Booth at the Princess's Theatre on 6 Nov. 1880, as the Queen in Hamlet; on 27 December as Francesca Bentivoglio in The Fool's Revenge; and on 17 January 1881 as Emilia in Othello. After playing at the Adelphi Theatre, Olga Strogoff in H. J. Byron's Michael Strogoff (14 March 1881), she fulfilled her last professional engagement at the St. James's Theatre, under the management of Messrs. Hare and Kendal on 20 October 1883, when she effectively acted Mrs. Rogers in William Gillette and Mrs. Hodgson Burnett's Young Folks' Ways. The death of an only daughter (by her first marriage) in 1901 unhinged her mind. At Margate, on 17 April 1902, she eluded the vigilance of her nurses, and flung herself from her bedroom window, with fatal result. She was buried at Highgate Cemetery.

Such coordination, which Osawa called as \\"inter-bodily chain\\" is the basis of our experiences. In his view, the interaction of the bodies produces the transcendental agency that defines what is valid and invalid or appropriate and inappropriate. The sociologist also labeled the period starting from 1995 onwards as the Age of Impossibility in contrast the Age of Virtuality (1970-1995). The former described a decline of totality in contemporary society while the latter, which was equated with virtuality, was an era when reality was relativized. Osawa has contributed to the most influential Japanese postmodern journal , edited by Kojin Karatani and Akira Asada. He has also written essays for the Japanese arts and technology journal called InterCommunication.

Biography Leonard Covello was born in 1887 at Avigliano, in the Basilicata region of southern Italy. In 1890 his father, Pietro Coviello, immigrated to the United States, leaving his wife and three children. Six years later, in 1896, the family was able to reunite in East Harlem, New York. Mary Elizabeth Brown, \\"Leonard Covello\\". In school in America, he was called Leonard and won a Pulitzer scholarship in high school that enabled him to attend Columbia University from 1907 to 1911 and graduate. In 1913 he was hired as a teacher of French and Spanish at DeWitt Clinton High School. With the entrance of the United States into World War I in 1917, Covello went to France where, because of his knowledge of the French language, he was assigned to duties as an interpreter and became a member of the Corps of Intelligence Police,Mary Elizabeth Brown, \\"Leonard Covello\\" conducting covert intelligence operations in Spain. In 1920 Covello returned to his former position at DeWitt Clinton High School. Here he deepened his pedagogical ideas on the integration of young Italian-Americans. Covello challenged the practices that tended to separate the children from their culture and language, including their families and their communities of origin, as a prerequisite for their success in studies. As he recollected in his autobiography: \\"throughout my whole elementary school career, I do not recall one mention of Italy or the Italian language or what famous Italians there were in the world, with the possible exception of Columbus…. We soon got the idea that 'Italian' meant something inferior, and a barrier was erected between children of Italian origin and their parents…. We were becoming Americans by learning how to be ashamed of our parents.\\"Leonard Covello, The Heart Is the Teacher (New York: McGraw Hill, 1958), 29f. In bilingualism and biculturalism Covello saw the means to facilitate the transition of children from immigrants to integrated citizens, without separating them from their communities or native culture, but on the contrary, instilling in them the pride of their roots.Balch Institute For Ethnic Studies For this purpose he founded \\"Il Circolo italiano\\" (The Italian Circle) at DeWitt Clinton in 1914. In 1922, he created the Department of Italian at DeWitt Clinton, which he directed until 1926, when he was promoted to First Assistant in Modern Languages, a position he held until 1934.Balch Institute For Ethnic Studies In 1934, the founding of Benjamin Franklin High School fulfilled his dream of creating in the East Harlem neighborhood a school organized around his educational theories.Michael C. Johanek, Leonard Covello\\" Covello was not only the principal and leader of the school, but carried out intensive work as lecturer in order to disseminate his pedagogical theories. From 1929 to 1942 he was Adjunct Professor at New York University, from which he received his Ph.D. in Education in 1944. When in the 1940s the neighborhood of East Harlem became increasingly Puerto Rican, Covello fought in favor of racial integration and applied to the Puerto Rican community the same principles he had tested in the 1920s and 1930s with the children of Italian immigrants. After a Sept 29, 1945 riot between black and white students, he successfully worked to calm tensions.Mary Elizabeth Brown, \\"Leonard Covello\\". At the invitation of Covello, Frank Sinatra visited the school, spoke about ethnic tolerance and sang Aren't You Glad You're You? as a sign of reconciliation.The New York Times In 1956 Covello retired from his role of principal of Franklin High School and accepted an appointment as an educational consultant of the Puerto Rican Migration Division. In 1962 he worked for the YMCA and in 1964 became director of the East Harlem Youth Career Information Conference. Covello was a founding member of the American Italian Historical Association (1966). In 1972, Leonard Covello went to Sicily at the invitation of educator Danilo Dolci to apply his methods of education to disadvantaged children in Sicily. Covello died August 19, 1982 in Messina, Italy. Works of Leonard Covello *The Social Background of the Italo-American School Child (Leiden: Brill, 1967; Totowa, NJ: Rowman and Littlefield, 1972) *The Heart is the Teacher (New York: McGraw Hill, 1958) The Heart is the Teacher The Heart is the Teacher is the 1958 autobiography of the Italian-American educator Leonard Covello, co-written with novelist Guido D'Agostino. The memoir details Covello's life as an Italian immigrant child and later teacher and principal in East Harlem, New York. It also offers Covello's reflections on the importance of schools and the community in the development of children in immigrant neighborhoods.  Purpose for Writing  Covello wrote The Heart is the Teacher as a reflection on his life as an Italian immigrant growing up in America and his experiences over forty-five years as a teacher of immigrant children. In the opening paragraphs of his memoir, he comments on his career in education: \\"I have learned much about the ways of immigrant peoples and their American-born children. I was an immigrant boy myself. I know what the American school can do to maintain family unity. I also know how the school can function as the integrating force in our democracy and in the molding of young citizens.\\"Leonard Covello and Guido D'Agostino, The Heart is the Teacher (1958; repr., New York: John D. Calandra Italian American Institute, 2013), 1. As an educator and community leader, he was a firm believer in the power of the school in shaping neighborhoods and the lives of new immigrants to the United States. Summary Experiences as an Immigrant Child = In the first half of The Heart is the Teacher, Covello recounts his life as a young Italian immigrant. He comments on his life growing up in Italy, waiting with uncertainty for his father to raise the money to bring the family to America. Once in New York, he describes the poverty that was a constant burden to immigrant families as they struggled to survive in tenement apartments in East Harlem. Covello's reflections on his teenage years draw attention to the challenges immigrant children faced embracing American culture in public while maintaining traditional Italian practices at home. He comments on his \\"fear of ridicule\\" in public over his foreign heritage and his efforts to maintain \\"separate watertight compartments\\" between his home and school lives.Covello and D'Agostino, Heart is the Teacher, 35. These tensions were most apparent in Covello's tortured relationship with school, as he frequently considered dropping out (which he did temporarily) to support his family.Covello and D'Agostino, Heart is the Teacher, 35-39. But encouraged by teachers and friends, Covello applied for and won a Pulitzer scholarship to study at Columbia. Covello notes that it was in college that he began to embrace his Italian heritage. In addition, through teaching night classes in English he began to develop his passion for teaching. = Career as a Teacher = In the second half of his memoir, Covello reflects on his career as an educator and community leader in East Harlem. After graduating from Columbia, Covello started teaching languages at DeWitt Clinton High School. As a teacher he sought to promote the passions of his Italian students by encouraging them to embrace their cultural heritage, forming an Italian Department and an Italian- American cultural club. When World War I broke out, Covello's teaching career was interrupted by a tour of duty, followed by a stint as an advertising agent. But his love of teaching brought him back to DeWitt Clinton, where he sought to act as both a teacher and mentor to his Italian boys. This included efforts to act as an intermediary between the separate spheres he struggled with as a teenager. As an Italian immigrant himself, he connected with his students and even made home visits to encourage traditional parents to accept their sons' educational aspirations. Outside of the classroom he helped organize numerous community programs, including night classes in English and American citizenship, as well as an Italian Parent-Teachers Association. When New York City named Covello the first principal of the new Benjamin Franklin High School in 1934, a position he held for 22 years, he sought to turn the school into a community center for the neighborhood. While stressing the importance of academics, Covello considered neighborhood engagement equally important as a means of encouraging children to stay off the streets while bettering their community. His memoir recounts interactions with many of his students over the years, who affectionately called him \\"Pop,\\" as well as the countless afterschool and evening programs he helped develop for the community. In the final chapters of his memoir, Covello comments briefly on his work with Puerto Ricans as the new immigrant group of New York City. He also reflects on the lessons he learned after nearly half a century as an educator. He stresses the importance of teachers and schools as shapers of rising generations of citizens, and in the end concludes that \\"the battle for a better world will be won or lost in our schools.\\"Covello and D'Agostino, Heart is the Teacher, 205.  Critical Reception of the Book  Contemporary reviews of The Heart is the Teacher were positive. A reviewer for The New York Times questioned why a man of Covello's education and experience took on a co- author, but nevertheless called the book \\"well worth reading.\\"Meyer Berger, \\"A Lifetime's Experience,\\" The New York Times, October 19, 1958, p. BR3. A reviewer for The Modern Language Journal was more praiseworthy, describing Covello as \\"an idealist with his feet firmly planted on the earth,\\" and lauding the book as \\"readable, written in a candid, engaging, and moving style.\\"Hymen Alpern, \\"Review,\\" The Modern Language Journal, 43.6 (Oct., 1959), p. 303-304. In 1998, Harvard professor in the School of Education Vito Perrone wrote Teacher with a Heart: Reflections on Leonard Covello and Community as part of the Teachers College Press Series \\"Between Teacher and Text.\\" In the book, Perrone comments on the legacy Covello left as an educator, and reflects on ways that current teachers can learn from Covello's experiences as a teacher in an immigrant community. The second half of the book offers select passages from The Heart is the Teacher.Vito Perrone, Teacher with a Heart: Reflections on Leonard Covello and Community (New York: Teachers College Press, 1998). In 2013, the autobiography was reprinted in its entirety as part of the John D. Calandra Italian American Institute's \\"Studies in Italian Americana\\" series.  Significance  The Heart is the Teacher offers an insightful look into the experiences of Italian immigrants in the first half of the twentieth century. Covello describes in great detail the challenges Italian immigrant families faced. These challenges began in Italy, as wives and children struggled to survive while husbands and fathers traveled to America to earn money to support and transport their families; they continued in America for families who lived in cramped tenements and faced uncertainty in finding enough work to support themselves. Covello's autobiography is especially valuable for its insights on children. He shares stories not only from his own childhood, but also from those of his students to demonstrate the challenges immigrant children or first generation Americans faced in balancing public and private lives. Like many of his students, Covello had to cope with feelings of being trapped by the views of his traditional Italian parents, whose culture centered on loyalty to the home and working to support the family. Covello's notions of separate spheres, evident not only in his experiences but those of his students, is an important concept for thinking about how immigrant and ethnic children coped with difficulties of embracing American culture without feeling that they were betraying their parents. The book also reflects Covello's belief that a school should function as a center for community development. He comments in great detail on the centrality of ethnic culture to an immigrant's response to American life, which became the subject of his doctoral work. As an educator he embraced his ethnic heritage and became a firm believer that cultural and community pride could be used to tap into student potential, engaging them in educational and outreach programs to better their community. He also recognizes the importance of bridging the generational gap which he had struggled with as a child by bringing parents into the community and making them an integral part of their children's educations. The Heart is the Teacher is a valuable resource for thinking about both immigration and education in the United States during the first half of the twentieth century. Covello offers detailed reflections and personal stories about the challenges new waves of immigrants faced coming to the United States in the twentieth century, including supporting families financially and balancing new American cultures with old world traditions. In addition, Covello's stories from his time as a student and teacher demonstrate that while school and community could increase tensions in immigrant families, they could also serve as centers of assimilation.

In 1970 he moved to the University of Turin, working at the Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Natural Sciences again as extraordinary professor of higher mechanics:Precisely, he was appointed as professor of \\"Meccanica superiore\\", according to and to who report also his exact position. in 1971 he became full professor of mathematical physics, a position he held up to 2007, when he retired. Besides the course of mathematical physics, Galletto held various courses relating to the area of his scientific interest: for example he held courses on astronomy as a lecturer. In 2008 he was appointed Emeritus professor. Honors In 1965 he was awarded the Ottorino Pomini prize by the Unione Matematica Italiana, jointly with Giuseppe Geymonat and Mario Miranda: the judging commission was composed by Dario Graffi (as the president), Giuseppe Grioli, Ennio De Giorgi and Enzo Martinelli (as the secretary). He was corresponding member of the Accademia delle Scienze di Torino since 1974, and became national resident member in 1980..According to his member data, he was elected \\"Socio corrispondente\\" on March 13, 1974, and \\"Socio nazionale residente\\" on May 5, 1980. In 1979 he was elected corresponding member of the Accademia Nazionale di Scienze, Lettere e Arti di Modena: later on, he became effective member in 1984 and emeritus member in 2002. He was also corresponding member of the Istituto Lombardo Accademia di Scienze e Lettere. Since 1980 he was corresponding member of the Accademia dei Lincei, and was elected national member in 1990.According to the Lincean yearbook (2012, p. 460), he was elected \\"membro corrispondente\\" on August 5, 1980, and \\"membro nazionale\\" on December 6, 1990. In 1989, the same academy awarded him the \\"Prize of the Minister of Heritage and Cultural Activity\\" for his work in mathematics and mechanics.Precisely, he was awarded the \\"Premio del Ministro per i Beni Culturali e Ambientali\\", according to the Lincean yearbook (2012, p. 153). On November 2, 2006 he was elected member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts,(САНУ Yearbook 2015, p. 60). and few months later, on 7 March 2007, he was elected corresponding non resident member to the class of mathematical sciences of the Società Nazionale di Scienze Lettere e Arti in Napoli.See the Society yearbook (2014, p. 40). Work=Research activity During his career, he published more than 150 papers in Italian and international journals. The beginning of his scientific production was under Grioli’s scientific influence: Galletto worked on the topic of his laurea thesis, i.e. on the theory of continua having asymmetric stress characteristics. However, soon he followed his independent research path, with pioneering works that forerun the so called generalised continuum theory. In this theory, among other things, the stress tensor considered is no longer the Cauchy tensor or any similar, double symmetric tensor, but an asymmetric tensor that generalizes it: and this gives to the theory many further important structural peculiarities.

Precipitation in this area is more than evapotranspiration; as a result, the condition is wet whole year.

They are an important water source in this area; Interception by clouds supplies 20% to 50% of the annual water supply, which is a relatively high rate. In the eastern Canada Temperate Rainforest, fog has a role of increasing precipitation about 5 to 8%. History The Appalachian Mountains started to form in the middle Ordovician period by the collision of plates. The collision which caused the uplift of the mountains began around 440 to 480 million years ago and ended around 230 million years ago.\\"Geologic Provinces of the United States: Appalachian Highlands Province.\\" USGS Geology in the Parks.

Uncovered area was a refuge for animals and plants which lived in northern areas. After the ice receded, some species spread back to north, while some of them stayed in this area.

N.p., n.d. Web. 1 Oct. 2013. Species High mountains make northern species able to survive. At the present, many plants form the temperate rainforest and the forests have a high rate of biodiversity. About 10,000 species, including endemic salamanders and turtles live in this area. Flora Red spruce and Fraser fir are dominant canopy trees in high mountain areas. In higher elevation (over ), Fraser fir is dominant, in middle elevation () red spruce and Fraser fir grow together, and in lower elevation () red spruce is dominant. Yellow birch, mountain ash, and mountain maple grow in the understory. Younger spruce and fir and shrubs like raspberry, blackberry, hobblebush, southern mountain cranberries, red elderberry, minniebush, southern bush honeysuckle are understory vegetation. Below the spruce-fir forest, at around , are forests of American beech, yellow birch, maple, birch, and oak. Skunk cabbage and ground juniper are northern species that remained in this region after the glacier retreated. The wet environment supports the high diversity of fungi. Over 2000 species live in this area and scientists estimate many unidentified fungi may be there. Fauna More than 30 species of salamanders are found in the rainforest and some of them are endemic, such as Black Mountain salamander, southern dusky salamander, Jordan’s salamander, and Cheat Mountain salamander. Rotten trees and moist leaves on ground provide a good, wet environment for amphibians, including salamanders. Many species of salamanders in this area do not have lungs, so they breathe through their skin and the wet environment is conducive for their survival. Two species of turtles are endemic as well: flatted muck turtle and Alabama map turtle. As mammals, the most familiar is likely the American black bear. Other common mammals are white-tailed deer and groundhog. Northern species like northern flying squirrel and red squirrel survive in the area because of the cool climate. Human use Native Americans have lived in this area for about 10,000 years. After contact with European settlers, the Cherokee Nation was forced to move in 1838 to 1839 from their traditional homeland to Oklahoma. Cherokees were relatively late comers to this region, and prior to their removal they were notorious for warring with rival tribes including the Muscogee and the Creeks. \\"Cherokee History in the North Carolina Mountains and Beyond.\\" Blue Ridge National Heritage Area.

Threat=Anthropogenic Air pollution is caused by anthropogenic factors, such as power plants, factories, and automobiles. It is related to acid rain and water pollution. Vegetation in high elevation is easy to collect pollutants. Acid rain damages the plants and makes streams more acidic. Acidic water affects aquatic species, such as fish, salamanders, and also vegetation. Air pollution affects ground ozone, which experience a biochemical change with sun light. The ground ozone damages plants. In the National Park Service, 30 plants species were damaged by the ground ozone and plants in higher elevation are prone damage. Non-native species are another threat. For example, Balsam Woolly Adelgids, an insect which was accidentally introduced from Europe kills Fraser fir. Many dead fir stands on mountain peaks. Fire Wild fire is created by lightning on average twice per year, usually in May or June. Although fire created by lightning is a natural disturbance and can be a threat, it is an important factor for ensuring biodiversity; Some native species, such as table mountain pines and woodpeckers, benefit from the environmental changes after fire. In the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the National Park Service performs controlled burns: \\"to invigorate a species or ecosystem that benefits from fire\\" and \\"to reduce heavy accumulations of dead wood and brush which under drought conditions could produce catastrophic wildfires that threaten human life and valuable property.\\" While some rare plants thrive after a controlled fire, many others are destroyed.

The museum has been officially opened on the 21st anniversary of her death. The museum exhibits iconographic costumes, including her tall fruit hats and platform-heeled shoes, and artifacts belonging to Carmen, as well as many of her records and films. In the second half of 2015, the new headquarters for the Carmen Miranda Museum will be opened at Rio de Janeiro's new Museum of Image and Sound (MIS). History External view of Carmen Miranda Museum in 2007. The Carmen Miranda Museum was officially created in 1956, through a decree signed by Francisco de Lima Negrão, Governor of the Federal District. But its inauguration took place twenty years later, on August 5, 1976, by the Governor of Rio de Janeiro Floriano Peixoto Faria Lima. Installed in Flamengo Park, the circular building was designed by architect Affonso Eduardo Reidy, later adapted by architect Ulisses Burlemaqui. The establishment of the museum was a response to the population and the legion of admirers, especially outsiders from various parts of the world, organized in numerous fan clubs, who wanted a space that could perpetuate the memory of the singer, one of the myths of Brazilian popular music. The museum in Rio de Janeiro, has over 3,500 items which help pay a tribute to the singer and actress Carmen Miranda (Feb.9, 1909-Aug.5, 1955). About 200 items are on display. A great part of the museum collection is available for research upon request. Roughly 460 of the items in the collection are garments and accessories. You'll see some of the famous platform shoes five-foot tall that Carmen (known as the Pequena Notável, or the \\"Notable Little One\\") wore in throughout her career. There are also glam dresses, like the one she wore for her last show, day before she died; and some of her signature turbans, including the one she wore for her wedding. You'll also see plenty of balangandãs - the dangling charms that were part of Carmen's baiana style. Initially meant as a Flamengo Park leisure center, the construction was adapted for its current use by Ulisses Burlemaqui in 1975. Currently the museum is closed to the public, while its collection is being prepared to compose the collection of the future of the Museum of Image and Sound (Museu da Imagem e do Som) in Copacabana. Collection Carmen Miranda's dresses and photos exhibited at the Museum. Carmen Miranda's turban was exhibited at the \\"Camp: Notes on Fashion\\" exhibition at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Its collection has some three thousand and five hundred pieces, mostly personal belongings of the artist, donated by the family after her death in 1955, through her sister Aurora Miranda and widower David Alfred Sebastian. It consists of musical scores, scripts, programs and costumes, and their collection of clothing, with costumes social and scenes, jewelry, platform shoes, turbans and accessories. With highlights, the skirt worn in The Streets of Paris, on Broadway in 1939, the turban worn at their wedding, the clothing worn the night she was honored in Grauman's Chinese Theatre in 1941. A large number of her publicity photos are on display blown up to near life-size, along with smaller photos showing the story of her life and career (2,000 photos), also on display is the outfit she wore to the 1941 Academy Awards ceremony, as well as jewelry and accessories, including some of her trademark tall fruit hats. The museum also has a large collection of video documentaries, biographies, the movies she starred in, and a compilation of her songs. About ten thousand people visit the museum each year. The museum also has a collection of over 2,000 photos. The museum also preserves original screenplays of films made in the United States, photographs, posters, trophies and awards. In addition to five thousand newspaper clippings and magazines that report historical events of the \\"Brazilian bombshell\\". In February 2009, the museum opened the celebration of Carmen Miranda's birth centennial. As part of the birth centennial year kickoff, the museum got a life-size resin statue of Carmen, created by artist Ulysses Rabelo, who studied her death mask and dental arch for the project. The statue wears the actual dress Carmen donned in That Night in Rio (1941). For many years, Cecilia Miranda de Carvalho (one of his sisters) was the manager of the collection of museu. Permanent Exhibition A large number of her publicity photos are on display blown up to near life-size, along with smaller photos showing the story of her life and career, also on display is the outfit she wore to the 1941 Academy Awards ceremony, as well as jewelry and accessories, including the trademark tall fruit hats. The museum also has a large collection of video documentaries, biographies, the movies she starred in, and a compilation of her songs. Highlights include the marriage certificate of Carmen Miranda and David Alfred Sebastian (1947), a mention honourable of U.S. Government to Miranda for their services rendered in World War II, a program of the show A night in Rio at Waldorf Astoria New York (1939) and other documents that show the trajectory of Carmen Miranda. There is also a collection of musical scores, composed of 980 items, highlighted for 80 printed scores of the 1930s. The Carmen Miranda Museum tells the story of the artist who, in a short time became one of the icons of national culture of Brazil. New Headquarters In Brazil, the most important recent tributes to the great star are her official website and the announced incorporation of the Carmen Miranda Museum in the Rio de Janeiro's new Museum of Image and Sound (MIS), to be opened in the second half of 2015. Construction of the new MIS building in Copacabana, with a project by Diller Scofidio + Renfro, is already under way. With the new building, the direction of MIS hopes that the new museum receives approximately 600,000 visitors per year.

His arguments are used today by Christian proponents of euthanasia. His best known works are The Experience of Death and The Moral Problem of Suicide. Landsberg lectured at the Universities of Bonn, Madrid and Paris, among others. He was a pupil of Martin Heidegger, Edmund Husserl and Max Scheler, continuing their work in Phenomenology to tackle several vital subjects, including personal identity, death and suicide.'Introduction' by M.Kerr to 'The Experience of Death' (1953) He was a close friend of the Christian Existentialist Emmanuel Mounier and a key contributor to the philosophical journal Esprit (1913-2013). Landsberg was hounded by the Gestapo for most of his life, both because of his Jewish family background and due to his expression of Anti-Nazi sentiments. He was captured by the Gestapo and deported to Oranienburg Concentration Camp towards the end of the war and died there of physical and mental exhaustion in April 1944. Early life and education Paul-Louis Landsberg was born in 1901 at Bonn into a large, wealthy Jewish family, the son of the prominent German Jurist Ernst Landsberg and his wife Anna. His parents had him baptized as a Protestant but later on he turned towards Catholicism and allied himself with the benedictine liturgical movement centered around Maria Laach. He was a pupil of the phenomenological philosophers Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger (in Freiburg)and Max Scheler. Though he studied with the latter-most in Cologne, he moved back to his birth-town to become Professor of Philosophy at the University of Bonn. However, due to his opposition to Nazism, he fled Germany just before the coming to power of Hitler in 1933. By the beginning of March 1933, he had emigrated to Spain and began teaching Philosophy there.The Encyclopaedia of Philosophy (8 Vols.), sub-entry on Landsberg (ed. Paul Edwards) During this period he was studying the Mystics of the 16th century. Between 1934 and 1936 he held positions at the Complutense University of Madrid and the University of Barcelona, where his thought began to exert a great influence over his pupils, and where it is still studied avidly to this day.'The History of Philosophy' (1941) by Julian Marias - Chapter on 20th Century Existentialists Paris and Esprit With the coming of the Civil War in Spain, Landsberg transferred to Paris where he began giving courses at the University of the Sorbonne on the Meaning of Existence. It was at this time that he also became deeply involved with the journal Esprit (1913-2013) through which channel his thought gradually became disseminated. Landsberg became close friends with the Personalist philosopher Emmanuel Mounier, whose themes bore a similarity to those explored in his own works. A friend of Max Scheler's, and a disciple of some of his Phenomenological techniques, Mounier was like Landsberg a Christian. Along with Gabriel Marcel these were probably the most significant 'Christian Existentialists'. On the other side were, of course, the Atheist Existentialists such as Landsberg's tutor Heidegger, Jean- Paul Sartre and Albert Camus, while Martin Buber was a significant Jewish Existentialist and Simone de Beauvoir, if you like, the leading Feminist Existentialist. Capture and death Unfortunately, Landsberg was for a long time persecuted by the Gestapo and it was clear that they were intent on having him put away, if not least for his Anti-Nazist views but also for his essentially Jewish parentage. First his wife Madeleine was taken captive by the Nazis and he spent a long odyssey cycling from town to town in France, both so as to escape from the German Army and in order to find her. He succeeded in joining an Anti-Nazi military group which provided him with official papers, enabling him to take shelter at several locations (Vendôme, Orléans, Lyon) yet always without any news of his wife. The group of the Esprit journal manage to see to the safe storage of some of his works and place him safely (for a moment) at the Psychiatric Asylum in Pau, where he is much in need of recovery after the trauma of being separated from his wife and being detained temporarily by the Nazis. Ultimately, Jacques Thérond, who heads the 'groupe Esprit' installs Landsberg at a hotel with papers under the name of 'Richert'. Against all odds he succeeds in finding his wife, joins a local combat group and evades anti-semitic persecution for some time. However, in March 1943 he is arrested as a Resistance fighter and as being of Jewish origin. He is deported to the concentration camp at Oranienburg, outside Berlin and is recorded as having died of exhaustion on 2 April 1944 while still incarcerated.'A Note on the Author' by Edouard d'Araille, from The Experience of Death (LTMI, 2007) Work and influence Landsberg's work is, like Mounier's and the other Existentialists, personal in tone. He is not interested in philosophy as a theoretical discipline but as an exploration of Conscience and the individual's personal confrontation with their own life and death. His deeply searching attitude to the questions of philosophy comes out very clearly in the opening words of his most important and influential work The Experience of Death : \\"What is the meaning of death to the human being as a person? The question admits of no conclusion, for we are dealing with the very mystery of man, taken from a certain aspect. Every real problem in philosophy contains all the others in the unity of mystery\\". His approach to understanding these issues is to look for an answer within experience, and he goes on to say: \\"It is necessary, therefore, to set a limit and seek a basis in experience for any possible answer\\". Landsberg's influence has been particularly marked on euthanasia groups as his work 'The Moral Problem of Suicide' provides a Christian approach to suicide which condones it instead of condemning it, and provides philosophical support for this view in arguing against traditional Catholic polemics on the topic. For a reader new to Landsberg, probably the most significant extract from his work is Chapter VIII. of his book The Experience of Death entitled \\"Intermezzo in the Bull Ring\\", where he creates an analogy between the life of any individual man and the struggle of the matador with the bull in the course of a bull-fight. Like Plato in his 'Allegory of the Cave' Landsberg has managed to make a deep reflection on life through a process of analogy. Through being more concrete in his description he enables the reader to visualize and understand what he is talking about with greater ease. Though the two key works above have been translated into English, they had been out of publication for several decades before their republication by Living Time World Thought in 2001. According to their website The Academy of the 3rd Millennium (A3M) is publishing The Essence and Meaning of the Platonic Academy as the introductory essay for a volume of Platonic Dialogues on the topic of education in April 2014. For an example of the discussion of Landsberg's contribution to the philosophy of death in recent literature see Death and Mortality in Contemporary Philosophy by Bernard N. Schumacher (2010). For an instance of his influence on Phenomenology see the Phenomenology of Life - From the Animal Soul to the Human Mind. For an account of his impact on bio-ethics, see the book The Least Worst Death: Essays in Bioethics on the End of Life by M. Pabst Battin.

She is best known as an authority on leading in extreme environments. Robertson is a former Antarctic Expedition Leader, who lead the 58th Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition (ANARE) to Davis Station in 2005. Her current work of speaking, writing and mentoring is based around the leadership lessons she learned in what she terms as\\"the world's most extreme workplace\\".  Personal life  Robertson was born in Geelong, Victoria, Australia to Sharon and Lawrence Robertson and grew up as the oldest child with a younger brother and sister. She spent the majority of her pre-adult life living in the South Eastern suburbs of Melbourne. Robertson now resides in Melbourne with her husband and child.  Early career  Robertson graduated from Deakin University with a Bachelor of Arts majoring in Public Relations and commenced a career in Public Relations with Melbourne Parks and Waterways (now defunct). She quickly moved out of PR and into the operational role of Park Ranger - Customer Services with the newly created Parks Victoria. Over a period of 14 years Rachael successively moved into more challenging and senior roles such that, at the time of leaving for Antarctica she was Chief Ranger of Victoria's South West Region. Rachael hates the cold and had only seen snow once before she led the expedition to Antarctica. She holds an MBA from Melbourne Business School.  Robertson's year in Antarctica  Robertson's role at Davis station was to provide leadership to the 120 scientists and tradespeople over Antarctic summer (December 2004 to February 2005) and then lead and manage the 17 other people who remained behind at Davis Station to maintain the operation until the scientists and tradespeople returned in November 2005. In \\"Leading on the Edge\\" she recounts the wide disparity between Antarctic life in summer, and Antarctic life in winter. Where the pace of life and work over summer is intense, and the leader must remember not just to manage but to lead people, the focus over winter turns inwards as all the work suddenly stops. As Robertson describes in her book \\"the repetitive monotony of the day-to-day work and the same old faces at breakfast, lunch and inner create a nine-month- long 'groundhog day' experience\\".  Robertson's leadership ideas  Once she returned from Antarctica Robertson earnt an MBA and used this education to develop her own leadership frameworks based on her Antarctic experience. These frameworks include: * Bacon Wars \\\\- A framework for understanding which of the small things that irritate people has the potential to become a larger problem and what to do about it. * No Triangles \\\\- A framework to enable people to have difficult conversations directly with the individual concerned, rather than \\"rope in\\" a third party. * The Plane Crash \\\\- Four pillars of effective Crisis Leadership * Respect Trumps Harmony \\\\- Why it's more important to show respect for each individual than it is to seek out harmony in a team * Lead without a title \\\\- A tool to help individual show leadership in their current position, regardless of their official title.  Clients  As of September 2017, Robertson has delivered more than 1000 keynote sessions to organisations and associations across the US, Australia, New Zealand and Asia. Her clients range from large global organisations such as Randstad to local fundraising events such as Day of Inspiration  Charitable work  Rachael is an Australia Day ambassador and is a media-spokesperson for RUOK? Day  Corporate Ambassador  In 2019, Rachael was sponsored by outdoor clothing company Yarra Trail as one of their three \\"Trailblazers\\" for the Autumn fashion season.

There are 20 known contemporary accounts of the First Fleet made by people sailing in the fleet, including journals (both manuscript and published) and letters. The eleven ships of the fleet, carrying over 1,000 convicts, soldiers and seamen, left England on 13 May 1787 and arrived in Botany Bay between 18 and 20 January 1788 before relocating to Port Jackson to establish the first European settlement in Australia, a penal colony which became Sydney. At least 12 people on the fleet kept a journal of their experiences, some of which were later published, while others wrote letters home during the voyage or soon after their arrival in Australia. These personal accounts of the voyage were made by people including surgeons, officers, soldiers, ordinary seamen, and Captain Arthur Phillip, who commanded the expedition. Only one known account, that of James Martin, was by a transported convict. Their journals document the day-to-day experiences of those in the fleet, and record significant events including the first contact between the European settlers and the Aboriginal people of the area. In 2009, the manuscript journals were included in The Australian Memory of the World Register, a regional register associated with the UNESCO international Memory of the World programme. Journals=Arthur Bowes Smyth Drawing of an emu from his journal Arthur Bowes Smyth (1750–1790) was a surgeon on board Lady Penrhyn, the transport that carried female convicts on the First Fleet. Smyth was born on 23 August 1750 at Tolleshunt D'Arcy, Essex, England, and was buried there shortly after his return to England on 31 March 1790. Son of Surgeon Thomas Smyth and the seventh of ten children, Arthur Bowes Smyth followed in his father's footsteps practising medicine in his place of birth until appointed \\"Surgeon to the Ship's Company\\" aboard Lady Penrhyn in 1787. Bowes Smyth then took charge of the prisoners on the ship when the convicts' surgeon John Turnpenny Altree fell ill at Tenerife and in Governor Arthur Phillip's opinion had proved unequal to the task. Bowes, as he was known in the colony, kept a journal from 22 March 1787 to 12 August 1789. The journal is a detailed account of the voyage, recording weather observations, events on board, treatment of the sick and descriptions of ports of call en route in particular Rio de Janeiro and Cape Town. His journal is notable for its interest in natural history including descriptions of bird life at Port Jackson and Lord Howe Island on Lady Penrhyn's return voyage. The journal contains 25 drawings in watercolour, pen and ink, including the earliest known surviving illustration of the emu by a European. These elements provide a unique account different from the other First Fleet Journals. His journal is one of the most detailed eyewitness accounts of the first weeks of European settlement of Australia. The journal entries for 18–26 January record first impressions on arrival including interactions with Aboriginal communities and descriptions of the vegetation, intense heat and native wildlife. The convicts and their children who disembarked Lady Penrhyn at Port Jackson are listed. His first journal entry dated 22 March 1787 records the full crew list and the women convicts, their name, age, trade, crime and term of transportation. The list of children born on the voyage contains inaccuracies regarding the sex of the child and dates of birth and death. Lady Penryhn, under charter to the East India Company to continue her voyage to China for a cargo of tea, departed Port Jackson in early May. His journal continues, recording the return voyage via Lord Howe Island, Tahiti, China, St Helena and finally England. The original journal is now in the collection of the National Library of Australia with a manuscript copy in the British Library and a third manuscript copy held by the State Library of New South Wales. William Bradley William Bradley's journal William Bradley (1757–1833) was a naval officer who sailed in the First Fleet on as first lieutenant. Bradley joined the navy in 1772, and served as a captain's servant, able seaman, midshipman, and master's mate, on H.M.S. Lenox, Aldborough, Mermaid, Rippon, Prothée, Phaeton and Ariadne. Bradley's journal is held by the State Library of New South Wales and begins in 1786 with the organisation of the fleet from Deptford to Portsmouth and Gravesend, describing taking convicts, instruments and supplies on board, and lists some names and numbers of those on board HMS Sirius. The journal records the voyage to Australia and describes ports, ships passed, the weather, as well as difficulties on board such having insufficient provisions to preserve the cattle on board. Upon arriving in Australia, Bradley recounts his impressions of the colony as well as his interest in Aboriginal people and natural history. In 1789 Bradley describes being one of a party ordered by Governor Arthur Phillip to capture two Aborigines, Colebee and Bennelong by force, calling it \\"by far the most unpleasant service I ever was order'd to Execute.\\" Bradley's journal contains 29 watercolours inserted between the pages, as well as 22 detailed charts illustrating the voyage to Australia, early survey expeditions in the colony, and further voyages on HMS Sirius. Two days after reaching Port Jackson, Bradley and John Hunter began to survey and chart Sydney Harbour, naming various landmarks including Bradley's Point (now known as Bradleys Head). The earliest known map of Sydney is Bradley's sketch of the encampment in March 1788. Bradley's journal also documents his journey to Norfolk Island in March 1790. HMS Sirius was wrecked on arrival, and Bradley remained for 11 months undertaking a survey of the island, then travelled back to Port Jackson on Supply. The journal concludes with the return of HMS Sirius crew to England in April 1792 on Waakzaamheid, anchoring at Portsmouth on 23 April. From 1809, Bradley suffered increasingly from mental disturbances. He was exiled to France after being caught attempting to defraud the postal authorities in 1814, and remained in exile until his death in 1833. Ralph Clark The diaries of Lieutenant Ralph Clark (pictured) spanned from March 1787 to June 1792, with several gaps. Ralph Clark (c. 1755–1794) was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, between 1755 and 1762 and died in the West Indies in 1794. He married Betsy Alicia Trevan in 1784 and their son Ralph Stuart (sic), was born in 1785. He was a Second Lieutenant of Marines with the 6th Company when he served on the convict transport Friendship bound for Botany Bay. He was later promoted to First Lieutenant. The convict transport Friendship was built in Scarborough, England, in 1784 and was 276 tons. It was the smallest of the convict transports and carried 76 male and 21 female convicts with a crew of about 20. Clark's journal covers the First Fleet voyage and the first few weeks in New South Wales. It is held by the State Library of New South Wales and covers the period from 9 March 1787 to 10 March 1788. It lists all convicts aboard the 'Friendship', including the date when each was received on board, name, trade, crime, sentence, when and where they were tried, county, and place of birth. Clark's journal gives an insight into his view of the convict women who he refers to as \\"damned whores\\" and \\"\\". His journal is of a very personal nature and makes constant reference to his 'beloved Betsy' and son Ralph, who he greatly missed. Clark's journal has only three entries for March 1787, and no further entries until 13 May 1787. His complete journal also covers later periods and is in four volumes, which includes his visit to Norfolk Island and his voyage on Gorgon returning to England. The four volumes cover the following time periods: 9 March 1787 – 31 December 1787, 1 January 1788 – 10 March 1788, 15 February 1790 – 2 January 1791, and 25 January 1791 – 17 June 1792. His journal and letterbook have also been published, transcribed and digitised. David Collins David Collins (1756–1810) was born on 3 March 1756 in London and joined the Royal Marines at the age of 14. He was Judge- Advocate for the military and civil courts in the new colony of New South Wales, and later the first lieutenant-governor of the newly established colony Van Diemen's Land. He served on HMS Sirius. Once he arrived in Sydney, Collins worked as secretary to Governor Phillip. From his arrival in Botany Bay with the First Fleet on 20 January 1788 on board HMS Sirius, Collins was responsible for the Colony's entire legal establishment. During his time on HMS Sirius and in the colony, he kept a journal which also included his experiences in the settlement at Sydney. In 1797 he returned to London and the following year with the help of his wife Maria, he published his journal entitled An Account of the English colony in New South Wales, a detailed first-hand account of early settlement in Australia. The book's introduction describes the long voyage of the fleet and particularly HMS Sirius to Australia. Collins gives an account of the accompanying ships, their weight and the number of convicts, supplies and crew each carried. He describes an incident on Sunday 20 May 1787, where a mutiny being plotted by some convicts on board Scarborough was discovered. Captain Phillip ordered the two ringleaders be taken on board HMS Sirius, where they were punished with two dozen lashes to each offender. In the introduction Collins also mentions the fleet's passage to Brazil and describes two accidents that took place on that part of the voyage: The rest of the volume describes life in the early days of the new colony. Collins describes the local Aboriginal people, the Australian environment, events, accidents, crimes, supplies and the weather. It also includes some illustrations and plates. A second volume was published in 1802. In 1803 he was appointed as lieutenant-governor and commissioned to form a new settlement at Sullivan Bay, Victoria. The location proved to be unsuitable, and Collins received permission to relocate to an existing settlement established at Risdon. He sailed for Van Diemen's Land (now known as Tasmania) on . Critical of the intended site at Risdon, Collins chose Sullivans Cove as a superior location and harbour for Hobart Town. He served as Lieutenant- Governor of Van Diemen's Land until he died in 1810. John Easty The first page of John Easty's journal John Easty (fl. 1768?–1793) was a private soldier in the marines. His dates of birth and death are not known. Easty joined the marines no later than January 1784, and was appointed to Captain- Lieutenant Meredith's company on 4 November 1787. He arrived with the First Fleet on Scarborough, the second largest vessel in the First Fleet. Easty's journal is held by the State Library of New South Wales and he was the lowest ranking author of the surviving journals of the First Fleet. He describes events on the voyage and in the colony in simple, irregular English. Incidents include accidents, crimes and punishments, and encounters with Aboriginal people. In March 1788 he received a flogging for bringing a female convict into the camp. Some of the journal is hearsay or was written later. Most of the events are reported in a matter of fact way, but Easty sometimes expresses his own strong opinions on matters such as the administration of the colony and religious beliefs. On 22 February 1790, he writes that he and a private in the 53rd Regiment, Thomas Brimage, signed and sealed their last wills and testaments to each other. Easty returned to England on Atlantic in December 1792, with the last detachment of marines to leave Sydney; Arthur Philip also returned home on this voyage. Easty rejoined his division at Portsmouth in May 1793. He left the marines and was employed by Waddington & Smith, grocers, in London in September 1794. In 1796 he petitioned the Admiralty for compensation promised for short rations in New South Wales. A transcription of John Easty's journal was published in 1965. John Hunter Pages from John Hunter's journal John Hunter (1737–1821), an officer of the Royal Navy, sailed with the First Fleet as a second captain on board HMS Sirius. Hunter went on to become the second governor of New South Wales and later retired having achieved the rank of vice-Admiral. Hunter was born on 29 August 1737 at Leith in Scotland. Hunter's journal is held by the State Library of New South Wales and describes his experiences during the First Fleet voyage and the early days in the colony. He also produced many charts, sketches and writings, including An Historical Journal of the Transactions at Port Jackson and Norfolk Island, With the Discoveries that have been Made in New South Wales and the Southern Ocean since the Publication of Phillip's Voyage (London, 1793) and a book of sketches of Birds & Flowers of New South Wales Drawn on the Spot in 1788, '89 & '90 Upon arriving at Port Jackson in January 1788, Hunter surveyed the harbour and the adjacent coast areas. In October 1788 Hunter was ordered to sail on HMS Sirius to the Cape of Good Hope for supplies. After circumnavigating the globe, in May 1789 he returned to New South Wales, where he resumed his former duties as a magistrate and surveyor of the Port Jackson area. In April 1792, following the wreck of HMS Sirius at Norfolk Island in 1790, Hunter returned to England where he was court-martialled for the loss of the vessel under his command, and honourably acquitted. In 1795 Hunter succeeded Arthur Phillip as the governor of New South Wales and served in this capacity until September 1800. His term as the governor was difficult and, after being accused of lack of competence and leadership, he was recalled from the office. He left for England having handed over government of the colony to Philip Gidley King. In 1801 Hunter returned to England, where he succeeded in clearing his name. He regained his standing in society and continued to progress his naval career. In 1807 he was promoted to rear-admiral, and finally in July 1810 to the rank of vice-Admiral. He died on 13 March 1821 in London. Philip Gidley King Philip Gidley King (1758–1808) was the second lieutenant on HMS Sirius serving under Arthur Phillip, the leader of the first sub-colony on Norfolk Island, and later the third governor of New South Wales. Philip Gidley King's private journal, Remarks & Journal kept on the Expedition to form a Colony, was kept in two volumes and is held by the State Library of New South Wales. Volume 1 of the journal covers the period between 24 October 1786 – 12 January 1789. A fair copy, annotated by another hand and entitled A narrative of the preparation and equipment of the First Fleet, the voyage to New South Wales in H.M.S. Sirius, events in N.S.W. and Norfolk Is., and the voyage to England in H.M.S. Supply, was also made. It includes a translation of some New Zealand Maori words. The journal contains details of events important to the community including items such as the weather, the amount of fish caught, persons sick or punished and crops that were grown. It was published with minor revision as an appendix to John Hunter's Historical Journal of the Transactions at Port Jackson and Norfolk Island in 1793. Jacob Nagle Jacob Nagle (1761–1841) was an ordinary seaman on board HMS Sirius. He was an American who was born in Pennsylvania in 1761 and who died in Ohio in 1841. As a young man he served in the American War of Independence, first as a soldier and later as a sailor. He was taken prisoner by the British and this led to him joining the British Navy in 1782. He was selected for duty on HMS Sirius in 1787. His journal was written as a memoir in 1840, after his retirement from a life at sea, and covers the 45 years of his life as a seafarer. There are two known copies, one in the William L. Clements Library at the University of Michigan and the other in the State Library of New South Wales. A transcribed, published version, edited and with commentary by C. Dann, was issued in 1988. The years covering 1787–1791 are those spent as part of the First Fleet expedition. Nagle's journal provides a detailed account of the First Fleet from the perspective of the common sailor. He writes in an informal style, as a worker, rather than the official language of the more educated decision makers. He was present at and gives detailed reports on many key events. He was a member of Governor Phillip's boat crew and took part in the explorations which led to the selection of Sydney as the site for settlement. He describes encounters with the Aboriginal people, including the spearing of Governor Phillip and the capture of Bennelong and Coleby. His eye- witness accounts of events often provide a very different perspective than the more official reports and journals. Nagle was on board HMS Sirius when it was wrecked on rocks at Norfolk Island in 1790. He was a strong swimmer and was able to help retrieve supplies. He remained on Norfolk Island until the crew were rescued in 1791, when he returned to England. Jacob Nagle's stories and reminiscences provide a colourful insight into the First Fleet experience. Arthur Phillip Arthur Phillip (1738–1814) was born in London on 11 October 1738 to Jacob and Elizabeth Phillip, a German language teacher and former wife of a naval captain. He was educated at the Greenwich school for the sons of seaman and completed a two-year apprenticeship in the mercantile service. His naval career began during the Seven Years' War and led to an accomplished career, which included a promotion to lieutenant. After a periodic retirement, Phillip returned to the British navy in 1778. In 1786, he was appointed the first Governor of New South Wales and Admiral of the First Fleet. He was chosen for his organisational, leadership and farming skills. He also displayed altruistic qualities, with plans to treat the Aboriginal people with decency and assist convicts with improving their lives. Although sailing on the flagship, , Phillip's journal chronicles many facets of the fleet's journey. This ranges from preparations and plans, significant stages of the voyage, to the first landing at Botany Bay in 1788. The first meetings with Aboriginal people are described, along with the resettlement to Sydney Cove at Port Jackson. The journal then concentrates on the early events of the colony, such as major naval movements, inland expeditions, scurvy outbreaks and ongoing encounters with the indigenous inhabitants. Accompanying these entries are drawings of land, marine and wildlife discoveries. These include: Lord Howe Island, the Port Jackson Shark and Kangaroo. In addition, the journal includes an Appendix, which provide the routes taken by each ship in the fleet and a list of convicts sent to the new colony. Due to a persistent health issue, Phillip returned to England in 1792. While he never returned to New South Wales, he retained an interest in its development. Phillip lived in Bath for most of his remaining life, until he died on 31 August 1814 . James Scott James Scott (d.1796) was a Sergeant of Marines on Prince of Wales. He travelled with his wife, Jane, who gave birth to a daughter en route. He returned to England in 1791 with his family, including a son, William, born in Sydney the previous year. His account of the voyage and his time in the colony, entitled Remarks on a passage Botnay [i.e. Botany] bay 1787 has survived and covers the dates 13 May 1787 – 20 May 1792. In his journal he records that he commanded the Quarter Guard, looked after pigs and poultry, and after arriving at Sydney searched for a lost marine in the bush. During the voyage, he records that a convict attempted to escape at Tenerife. He died in Portsmouth, England in 1796. The diary was published in 1963 as Remarks on a passage to Botany Bay, 1787–1792 : a First Fleet Journal. Daniel SouthwellWatkin Tench Watkin Tench (1758?–1833) was a Captain- Lieutenant of the Marine Corps and author. He was born between May 1758 and May 1759 at Chester, England, the son of Fisher Tench and his wife Margaret (Margaritta). Towards the end of 1786 he volunteered for a three-year tour of service with the convict settlement about to be formed at Botany Bay. He sailed in the transport Charlotte on 13 May 1787 as one of the two captain- lieutenants of the marine detachment under Major Robert Ross, and arrived in Botany Bay on 20 January 1788. Watkin Tench kept a journal on board Charlotte and continued to document life in the early colony. Tench has been described as having a flair for writing, and he provides anecdotes about all aspects of life in the colony, including convict life, daily activities and reflections on the Aboriginal tribes. He records his impressions of Tenerife, Rio de Janeiro and Cape Town, where the fleet stopped to restock supplies, and also describes in detail the behaviour of the convicts. Tench, described in some sources as being particularly humane in his treatment of convicts, records his \\"great pleasure\\" when on 20 May, in light of the good behaviour of the convicts, many were released temporarily from their bonds. Phillip's decision to lead a small advance group of ships to Botany Bay, to begin construction of the settlement, is described by Tench as a decision made due to unfavourable winds after leaving the Cape of Good Hope, although this had been allowed for in Phillip's instructions. Tench arranged for John Shortland, sailing back to England in 1788 on Alexander, to take Tench's manuscript with him so that it could be published. The journal was first published in London in 1789 by Debrett's as A narrative of the expedition to Botany Bay: with an account of New South Wales, its productions, inhabitants, &c..; It was one of the earliest published accounts of the First Fleet voyage and the early settlement of Australia. The book ran to several editions and was later published in several languages, including French, German, Dutch & Swedish. John White Photograph of John White's published journal, open to a drawing of a Tabuan parrot. John White (1756?–1832) served as the chief surgeon on the fleet and to the settlement at Port Jackson. He had served on other ships in the Royal Navy, including as surgeon's mate on HMS Wasp and surgeon on HMS Irresistible before being recommended for the expedition to Botany Bay by Sir Andrew Snape Hamond. His assistant surgeons on the First Fleet were Dennis Considen, Thomas Arndell and William Balmain. White's diary records details of how he ordered medical supplies, supervised the embarkation of the convicts and made visits during the voyage to the ships to check on the health of the convicts and crew. White was also a keen amateur naturalist and on arrival in Port Jackson he was particularly interested in the birds of the colony. White sent the journal of his trip to Thomas Wilson, a friend in London, who published it in 1790. The published edition included engravings drawn from the specimens White collected and appeared under the title Journal of a voyage to New South Wales : with sixty-five plates of non-descript animals, birds, lizards, serpents, curious cones of trees and other natural productions . White remained in the colony until December 1794, supervising the medical care of the convicts and crew arriving on the Second Fleet in 1790 and the Third Fleet in 1791. The journal of Watkin Tench, another member of the colony, describes White adopting a young Aboriginal boy, named Nanbaree, who was orphaned by the smallpox epidemic at Port Jackson in 1789. Letters=David Blackburn David Blackburn (1753–1795), from Newbury, Berkshire, England, was the master of HMS Supply. He wrote a series of letters to family members and friends, many of which are still extant. These letters describe the events of the voyage and the early days of settlement, including Blackburn's participation in the expedition to Norfolk Island to establish a settlement there in February 1788. Blackburn's letters record the change in his feelings towards the voyage. Initially reluctant to join the fleet, shortly before the fleet left he told his letter in a letter that \\"my dislike to the voyage begins gradually to wear off\\". Supply was part of the advance party of ships which arrived in Botany Bay on 18 January. Blackburn also joined Phillip's expedition in search of a better location for the settlement, and describes Sydney Harbour as \\"excellent and extensive\\". He died of illness on 10 January 1795. James Campbell James Campbell served as Captain of Marines on Lady Penryhn. His dates of birth and death are not known. Campbell strongly criticised Phillip's actions, both during the voyage and after arrival in Australia. In a letter to Francis Reynolds-Moreton, 3rd Baron Ducie, dated 12 July 1788, Campbell describes the final stages of the voyage. He criticises Phillip's decision to take a small party of ships ahead as a \\"Don Quixote scheme\\" and notes that the two parties arrived within a few days of each other. John Campbell John Campbell travelled on Lady Penrhyn as part of the fleet. He wrote a letter to his parents while travelling back to England, in which he describes the voyage and early days of the colony. Although he travelled on Lady Penrhyn, he is not included in Arthur Bowes Smyth's list of crew members on board. He later returned to England on the same ship. He remained on board Lady Penrhyn while Phillip took a party ashore at Sydney Cove to plant the British flag, and describes his view of events in his letter: Newton Fowell Newton Fowell (1768–1790) was a midshipman on HMS Sirius during the voyage to Australia. He was born in Devonshire, England. He joined the fleet after being recommended to Captain Phillip by Evan Nepean. He wrote a series of letters to his father both while on board and after arriving in Australia describing his experiences on the voyage and during the early days of settlement. He sent his first letter on the voyage on 20 May 1787, taking advantage of the return of Hyena to England after it had escorted the fleet out of British waters. In this letter he describes the fair winds enjoyed by the fleet as it left England, states that they hope to reach Tenerife in a fortnight, and notes that most of the convicts are \\"in good health\\". He wrote again from Santa Cruz, describing the events of the previous weeks including the discovery of a planned mutiny, and his admiration of Captain Phillip. In his letter of 12 July 1788, Fowell describes the final two months of the voyage and the first six months of the European settlement at Sydney Cove. He also states that Phillip named the settlement Albion on 4 June 1788. Fowell was promoted to 2nd Lieutenant and, after HMS Sirius was shipwrecked in March 1790, he was sent to Batavia in 1790 on HMS Supply to obtain supplies for the colony. He died at sea on 25 August 1790 after contracting a fever. His original manuscript letters have survived, and have also been published. Richard Johnson Richard Johnson (1753–1827) was a Church of England clergyman who performed the first Christian church service in Australia. He joined the fleet as a result of his interest in mission and prison reform. He travelled on Golden Grove. He wrote a series of letters to friends and family from the colony. In his letter had 10 February 1788, he gives an account of the voyage and arrival in Australia. His faith is clear in his letters and does not waver. He describes a storm which struck the fleet on 1 January 1788, which lasted 24 hours. Johnson remained in the colony for 12 years, returning to England in 1800 for health reasons. Henry Waterhouse Henry Waterhouse (1770–1812) was a midshipman on HMS Sirius. He wrote a letter to his father on 11 July 1788. He describes the fleet's encounters with wildlife during the voyage including birds, seals and whales. He was part of the expedition to Norfolk Island to found a settlement there. George Worgan George Bouchier Worgan (1757–1838) was a naval surgeon on HMS Sirius. Worgan's journal takes the form of a letter to his brother Richard dated 12 June 1788. The journal covers the early months of European settlement in New South Wales (20 January to 11 July 1788). The first section, written on HMS Sirius, describes the fleet's arrival and their first encounter with Aboriginal Australians. In the journal he talks about a \\"rough journal\\" and a more complete form. He describes expeditions, the coastline, and flora and fauna. He also describes the building activities involved in setting up the settlement in New South Wales, as well as native wood varieties and stone. Worgan describes in detail the activities and behaviour of both the European settlers and the Indigenous people of the area, and the interactions between these groups. While in the colony Worgan went on expeditions to the Hawkesbury River and Broken Bay areas north of Sydney and accompanied Watkin Tench to the Nepean in 1790. He also spent a year on Norfolk Island. He returned to England in 1791. Worgan died at Liskeard on 4 March 1838. Convict narrative=James Martin James Martin (also spelled 'Martyn') was born c. 1760 in Ballymena, County Antrim. He had a wife and son in Exeter and had worked in England for seven years when, at Exeter Assizes on 20 March 1786, he was sentenced to transportation for seven years for stealing eleven screw bolts and other goods from Powderham Castle. He was held on the Dunkirk hulk for almost a year, and was embarked upon Charlotte on 11 March 1787, by which he was transported to New South Wales. Martin was apparently a useful tradesman in Sydney, and his narrative – known as the Memorandoms of James Martin – is the only extant first-hand account written by a First Fleet convict. On the night of 28 March 1791, Martin, along with William Bryant, his wife Mary (née Broad) and their two children Charlotte and Emanuel, William Allen, Samuel Bird, Samuel Broom, James Cox, Nathaniel Lillie, and William Morton, stole the colony's six-oared open boat. In this vessel, the party navigated the eastern and northern coasts of Australia, survived several ferocious storms, encountered Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders, and reached Kupang in Dutch West Timor on 5 June 1791, the entire party having survived. There, they successfully – for a while, at least – passed themselves off as the survivors of a shipwreck. Once their true identities were discovered, the escapees were imprisoned and returned to England. During this journey, William Bryant, Emanuel Bryant, James Cox, Samuel Bird, and William Morton died. The survivors arrived back in England on 18 June 1792. On 7 July they were brought to the bar at the Old Bailey, and ordered to remain in Newgate gaol until their original sentences of transportation had expired. Mary Bryant received an unconditional pardon on 2 May 1793 when her sentence expired, while Martin, Allen, Broom, and Lillie were released by proclamation on 2 November 1793. From there, they largely disappear from the historical record. The Memorandoms is part of the Bentham Papers archive in University College London Library's Special Collections. It was first discovered by the Bentham scholar Charles Blount, who in 1937 published a short edition, limited to 150 copies. In 2017, an open-access book, containing reproductions of the original manuscript and a detailed introduction, edited by Tim Causer, was published by UCL Press.

It has rough, dark grey to black \\"ironbark\\", lance- shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, white flowers and conical fruit. Description Eucalyptus dura is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has dark grey to black ironbark on the trunk and larger branches, smooth grey to cream-coloured bark on branches less than in diameter. Young plans and coppice regrowth have lance-shaped to egg- shaped leaves long and wide. Adult leaves are lance-shaped, sometimes curved, long and wide on a petiole long. The leaves are the same or a similar glossy green on both sides. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven on the end of branchlets on a branched peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are oval to pear-shaped, long and wide with a conical operculum that is narrower and shorter than the floral cup. Flowering mainly occurs from April to June and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, conical capsule long and wide on a pedicel long with the valves below the level of the rim. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus dura was first formally described in 1991 by Lawrie Johnson and Ken Hill from a specimen collected from Turkey Mountain in the Barakula State Forest in 1984. The specific epithet (dura) is a Latin word meaning \\"hard\\" or \\"tough\\", referring to the bark of this tree. Distribution and habitat This ironbark grows in grassy and dry forests in sandy soil, usually on higher places. It occurs between the Biggenden, Chinchilla and Boonah districts in south-east Queensland. Uses=Essential oils The leaves of E. dura are rich in oils, particularly β-phellandrene and 1,8-cineole. These oils may be suitable for development of a bacteriostat.

The main symptoms of cervicogenic headaches include pain originating in the neck that can travel to the head or face, headaches that get worse with neck movement, and limited ability to move the neck. Diagnostic imaging can display lesions of the cervical spine or soft tissue of the neck that can be indicative of a cervicogenic headache. When being evaluated for cervicogenic headaches, it is important to rule out a history of migraines and traumatic brain injuries. Studies show that combining interventions such as moist heat applied to the area of pain, spinal and cervical manipulations, and neck massages all help reduce or relieve symptoms. Neck exercises are also beneficial. Specifically, craniocervical flexion, or forward bending of the neck, against light resistance helps increase muscular stability of the head and neck region. This may reduce head and neck pain. It is recommended to seek assistance from trained health professionals, such as physical therapists, who can teach proper techniques and doses of exercise. With proper treatment, symptoms often resolve in three months.

The island is dominated by a large mountain, with all its residents living on the east side. The mountain, Kinnaklova, is a very notable landmark to sailors in the region since it has a deep ravine that cuts through the center of the peak. The island is the home to the historic Kinn Church, dating back to the 12th century. The church was the seat of the large parish of Kinn for centuries. The island was also the centre (and namesake) of the old municipality of Kinn which existed from 1838 until 1964. The island can be reached by ferry from the town of Florø. The Kinnaspelet, a historical play, is performed on the island every summer. The Ytterøyane Lighthouse is located about northwest of the island. Name The island was named after the old Kinn farm (Old Norse: Kinn) since Kinn Church is located there.

The purpose of PAIVM is to assess the amount and quality of movement at various intervertebral levels, and to treat pain and stiffness of the cervical and lumbar spine.Geoffrey Douglas Maitland, Elly Hengeveld, Kevin Banks, Kay English, (2005). Maitland's Vertebral Manipulation, Volume 1. Elsevier Butterworth-Heinemann. . Technique During assessment, the aim of PAIVM is to reproduce patient symptoms, and assess the endfeel of cervical movement, quality of resistance, behaviour of pain throughout the range of movement, and observe any muscle spasm. A posterior to anterior force of varying strength is applied by the therapist either centrally onto the spinous process, or unilaterally on either the left or right articular pillar. As a treatment technique, pain is treated by oscillations of small amplitude short of resistance, whilst stiffness is treated by larger amplitudes 50% into resistance.Darlene Hertling, Randolph M. Kessler, (2006). Management of Common Musculoskeletal Disorders: Physical Therapy Principles and Methods. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. . Contraindications The technique is contraindicated by bone disease, malignancy, pregnancy, vertebral artery insufficiency, active ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, spinal instability, acute irritation or compression of the nerve root, and recent whiplash. Clinical evidence A 2005 study by Abbott et al. suggested that as an assessment technique, PAIVMs are highly specific, but not sensitive, in the detection of lumbar segmental instability.J Haxby Abbott, Brendan McCane, Peter Herbison, Graeme Moginie, Cathy Chapple, Tracy Hogarty, (2005). Lumbar segmental instability: a criterion-related validity study of manual therapy assessment. BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders, 6:56.

Maitland's Vertebral Manipulation, Volume 1. Elsevier Butterworth-Heinemann. . Technique PPIVM is used as an assessment technique to assist with identifying the location, nature, severity and irritability of vertebral symptoms. They can be used to test for cervical or lumbar joint hypermobility or instability, or whether a joint is locked. PPIVM assessments test the movement available at a specific spinal level through the application of a passive physiological movement.Darlene Hertling, Randolph M. Kessler, (2006). Management of Common Musculoskeletal Disorders: Physical Therapy Principles and Methods. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. . Cervical PPIVMs can be performed in cervical lateral flexion or rotation, with the therapist restricting movement beyond a certain cervical level by blocking with the hand; this allows the identification of the exact spinal level where patient symptoms occur. In regards to the lumbar spine, the technique is performed with the therapist reaching under the patient's knees, and lifting to obtain the desired lumbar movement whilst assessing the movement of the spinous process using the fingers.

History The Dowse Art Museum is named after Mayor Percy and Mayoress Mary Dowse, both of whom died prior to the museum opening. Percy Dowse served as the mayor of Hutt City from 1950 to 1970. He was a firm believer in the principle of having physical, social, and cultural facilities in modern cities and he initiated a building phase in the city that saw the construction of landmark buildings such as the War Memorial Library, the Lower Hutt Town Hall, and the Ewen Bridge. He championed the addition of an art gallery to the building spree. His wife, Mary Dowse, was the first president of the Hutt Valley National Council of Women. She was also an ardent supporter of the arts. She teamed up with Elizabeth Harper from The Hutt Art Society, and the duo lobbied the City Council. They succeeded in their endeavor when, in 1963, the Council agreed to provide space for an art gallery. The gallery was originally housed in an extension of the War Memorial Library but after Mary died in a road accident in 1964 the City Council made a unanimous decision to honor her by constructing a new building for the art gallery. The museum was only partially completed when Percy died in 1970. Directors  * David Millar was the founding director, heading the museum 1971–1976.

The depot is situated between Filton and Stoke Gifford at a junction intersection of the Cross Country Route, South Wales Main Line and the Filton to Avonmouth Docks line. It is operated by Agility Trains as part of its contract to maintain the Class 800 and Class 802 fleet operated by Great Western Railway. Location The depot is sited approximately halfway between Stoke Gifford and Filton, on land bounded by railway lines. The site is approximately triangular shaped, in area, formed by boundaries created by three railway lines: to the south, the Bristol Parkway to Avonmouth Docks (the Filton to Avonmouth Line); the western boundary is formed by the former Bristol and South Wales Union Railway (B&SWUR;) route; the north-east boundary is formed by a chord connecting Bristol Parkway to the former B&SWUR; line for the Severn Tunnel, History=Background In the early 19th century the land between Stoke Gifford and Filton was essentially rural. The first railway at the location was the north-south Bristol and South Wales Union Railway (1860s); followed by the eastward London, Bristol and South Wales Direct Railway (1900s); and the Filton to Avonmouth Line (1910s). The lands at the other three corners formed by the intersection of the east-west and north- south lines were also enclosed by connecting embanked earthworks of connecting chords by the 1920s.See also, information in the articles London, Bristol and South Wales Direct Railway, Bristol and South Wales Union Railway, Filton to Avonmouth Line, and Patchway railway station By the second half of the 20th century the southern part of the site was being used as a rail connected spoil heap; this use continued up to the 21st century. The site was involved in processing of used railway ballast, and from 1998 non-railway rubble was also processed. A small stream, Stoke Brook, as well as tributaries and other drains crossed the site; it was redirected in the latter part of the 20th century, and by the 21st century had been mostly culverted. In 2009 Agility Trains was named as the preferred bidder for the Intercity Express Programme train procurement. After being placed on hold and put under review the decision to continue with procurement process was taken in May 2011. Intercity Express Programme depot In mid 2011 Hitachi Rail Europe began the formal application process with South Gloucestershire Council for the construction of a rail depot at the 'Stoke Gifford Triangle'.Application number PT11/025/SCR, (31 May 2011) In September 2011 a planning application was submitted;Application number PT11/2781/F, 1 September 2011 as specified, the depot was designed for a maximum train length of around (10 car, 26m carriage trains) with stabling for 17 trains. The maintenance building was a two road structure including staff and office buildings, other facilities included a train washing building , a wheel lathe building , a two-floor accommodation building as well as smaller structures including pump rooms (fuel, oil, waste water), and a shunters' cabin. Other structures included electricity substations, and tank farms. The entire site's working track was to have overhead line electrification. Rail access to the site was to be via connections in the south-east corner to the Stoke Gifford junction to Patchway junction chord of the South Wales Main Line,In ' the line is referred to as the South Wales and Bristol Down Tunnel line. and to the Avonmouth and Filton Line; a connection in the northwest corner to the Stoke Gifford/Patchway junction chord is also proposed. Significant local opposition developed to the plan, including concerns about noise pollution and light pollution during night shift working, as well as concerns about a negative effect on house prices. Stoke Gifford parish council also opposed the plans. South Gloucestershire Council approved the plan in February 2012. Construction by VolkerFitzpatrick commenced in August 2013.Hitachi Rail Europe celebrates topping out at new Stoke Gifford Train Maintenance Centre Hitachi Rail Europe 23 January 2015 In 2013 the plans were amended by application No. PT13/1744/RVC. Minor operational changes were made: the carriage wash was moved to be adjacent to the main maintenance building, and was ~15m longer than originally stated; stabling sidings was reduced to 16; positions of plant and track layout were altered, for operational reasons, also reducing the proximity of work activities to nearby residential properties; screening earthworks and access roads were also altered. Due to the presence of biological lifeforms on the site the developers have proposed the rail bounded triangle of land to the south of the site as an environmental mitigation area. Control of the site was transferred from Network Rail to Hitachi in early 2013. The depot was completed in March 2016 and became operational with the first visit by a Class 800 in summer 2016.Stoke Gifford intercity express depot Volker Fitzpatrick Regular operations commenced in October 2017 when the Class 800s entered service with Great Western Railway.First new trains in a generation launched by GWR FirstGroup 16 October 2017 See also *21st- century modernisation of the Great Western Main Line References=NotesSources * ** ** ** Category:Rail transport in Gloucestershire Category:Railway depots in England Category:Transport infrastructure completed in 2016 ","title":"Stoke Gifford depot"},{"id":"41002341","text":"Lewis Milne (born 26 April 1994) is a Scottish footballer who plays as a midfielder for Montrose.

It is made from ordinary non-glutinous rice, and it is only sold fresh. Difference from other noodles Unlike the circular mixian, migan is primarily defined by its relatively broad and flat shape. It is somewhat less widely available than mixian, even within Yunnan, though it is still common. Migan is both rice flour based and freshly prepared, which differentiates it from the transparent fensi noodles that are common throughout much of mainland China. Serving Migan is typically served either in broth (often a chicken based broth, and particularly commonly consumed in the morning, though still consumed all day) or stir fried (perhaps more common in the evening). As with mixian, when migan is served in broth it is common for a range of individual condiments to be presented for customers to add to their bowl themselves. Condiments typically include chilli (diced fresh chilli, plus at least one or two prepared chilli pastes, often mixed with oil), coriander, garlic, pepper (both regular pepper and powdered or whole Sichuan pepper), salt, spring onion, soy sauce, tomato, vinegar and zhe'ergen (a spicy root common to southwestern China). The creation of a rich broth is a quintessential part of the migan experience. Chefs generally prepare the noodles without breaking them.

They are used for extremely arduous service, such as sealing the head gasket of high performance piston engines. Hollow, metallic Wills Rings are used as they have better springback than yielding soft metal seals and higher temperature limits than elastomer O rings.  Construction  A Wills Ring is an O-ring in the form of a hollow metallic tube. They are pressurised internally by gas pressure The advantages of this construction are that the rings can seal against a wide range of conditions. Metallic construction makes them robust against high or low temperatures and chemical attack. Softer coatings may be applied to provide even better compatibility, or to seal against roughly machined surfaces. Internal pressurisation makes them compliant, both for the range of movement required and with their speed of response being faster than elastomeric O-rings. Their flexure is also unaffected by temperature.The Space Shuttle Challenger disaster was an accident caused by the poor dynamic response of cold elastomers. Rings are pressurised by either a static gas fill during manufacture, or may be pressure-actuated by the applied pressure on the joint in service. These pressure-actuated rings have vents on the pressure side to allow gas ingress. The 4 MPaAtmospheric pressure is approximately 0.1 MPa pressure limit of the unpressurised ring is exceeded by the 40 MPa of the internally pressurised ring and 200 MPa or 1,000 MPa for the externally pressurised forms. Wills Rings are manufactured in five overall types: ; Hollow, internally gas pressurised : A high performance seal suitable for extreme pressures and still sealing when pressure is released. ; Hollow, slotted pressure-actuated : Best springback performance. ; Hollow, vented : Suitable for even higher pressures than the slotted form. ; Hollow, unpressurised : Lower cost and higher clamping forces ; Solid : Limited springback and pressure capacity, these are mostly used as a non-outgassing metallic seal for use in vacuum systems. The vented and slotted forms are usually vented to the inside, for carrying an internal pressure, but are also available with external vents, for use in high external pressures, such as in undersea use.As vacuum systems will develop a maximum of 1 Bar pressure differential, they use the internally pressurised or solid forms instead. They are only used for static face sealing, not moving glands. The thin tube walls are sensitive to damage from rough handling, point tools and crimping during assembly. The pressure-actuated form is considered to be slightly more resistant to point damage, but more at risk of folding and crimping, as they are not supported by internal pressurisation during assembly. Rings are installed in machined grooves in, usually one of, the mating faces. The correct perpendicular depth of these grooves (rather than their width or cross-sectional area) is an important factor that controls seal performance. Unlike the grooves for elastomer O-rings, the width and shape of the groove is unimportant, just the depth. It is even possible for this 'groove' to become an open-sided groove or aperture, provided that this free height is maintained. Wills Rings are constructed in a variety of refractory metals including stainless steel and Inconel. Coatings of PTFE or varying thicknesses of silver plating are also available.  Applications = Cylinder head gaskets  One of the best-known applications for pressurised Wills Rings, or Cooper Rings as they were originally known, is for sealing the combustion chamber of piston engines. These are not widely used, owing to their high cost and the good performance of other modern gaskets, but they have a place for high-performance engines. One of the first applications in this case was for the Coventry Climax racing engines. Coventry Climax's more mundane utility engines did not require these seals, but they were adopted to production car engines such as the Hillman Imp, and when these were re-tuned for racing, it was a regular practice to add this type of supplementary seal. Some Coventry Climax designs, such as the FWMV V8, used an open-deck block with wet liners. These were located in place at the base of the liner, rather than near the cylinder head. They were thus susceptible to problems from differential thermal expansion, giving rise to coolant leakage, where the block and liner expanded at different rates: specifically when the liners contracted more rapidly as engine load was reduced. The solution to this was to redesign the liner so that they were located at the top instead, reducing the distance susceptible to expansion. The high compliance of the Wills Ring, thanks to their internal pressurisation, allowed reliable sealing, even though the short clamping distance now had little elasticity and so the applied clamping force from the head bolts could vary substantially.  Cost  Wills Rings are expensive in comparison to other seals, such as elastomer O-rings or metallic foil head gaskets. A typical comparison is one ringMotor-racing quality, rather than aerospace. costing approx. $50 each, around the price of a high- performance head gasket for a four-cylinder engine.

The term comes from the French tradition of sociology of religion \\"la religion vécue\\". The concept of lived religion was popularized in the late 20th century by religious study scholars like Robert A. Orsi and David D. Hall. The study of lived religion has come to include a wide range of subject areas as a means of exploring and emphasizing what a religious person does and what they believe. Today, the field of lived religion is expanding to include many topics and scholars. Scholars=Robert Orsi Robert A. Orsi is Professor of Religious Studies and History and Grace Craddock Nagle Chair in Catholic Studies at Northwestern University. He researches, writes, and teaches about religion in the United States, in the past and in contemporary contexts, with a particular focus on American Catholicism.https://sites.weinberg.northwestern.edu/orsi/ Orsi’s book The Madonna of 115th Street: Faith And Community In Italian Harlem, 1880-1950, won several prizes including the Jesuit National Book Award and is an example study of lived religion. Orsi defines lived religion as including \\"the work of social agents/actors themselves as narrators and interpreters (and reinterpreters) of their own experiences and histories, recognizing that the stories we tell about others exist alongside the many and varied story they tell of themselves\\". Orsi understands lived religion to be centered on the actions and interpretations of religious person. In order to study and write about lived religion Orsi suggests a broad field of study in terms of topic matter and methodology. Orsi describes his own process of studying lived religion for Madonna On 115th Street as wide in scope. \\"I came to realize that I was learning as much from how people were to me as from what they were telling me, as much as what was going on around the stories as from the stories themselves.\\" Rather than a narrow archival study, Orsi’s focus on non- traditional forms of research demands that scholars give attention to institutions and persons, texts and rituals, practices and theology, things and ideas. In order to study lived religion, Orsi advocates for a complex academic lens where almost anything can hold meaning and serve as a source or text for study.La Madonna col Bambino In The Madonna Of 115th Street, Orsi studies the lived religion of Catholic Italian immigrants in Harlem New York. Orsi focuses on a particular religious celebration known as the festa for The Madonna and the social structures that create and layer the event. Through observations, story telling, conversations and research Orsi weaves a picture of life for this immigrant community. In his book, Orsi explores and explains various internal traditions, cultures, and power and social dynamics in order to illustrate the various religious meanings and significance for community in Italian Harlem. Orsi talks about the importance of dynamic subject matter covered by the study of lived religion. \\"The study of lived religion is shaped by and shapes the way family life is organized, for instance; how the dead are buried, children disciplined, the past and present imagined, moral boundaries established and challenged, home constructed, maintained and destroyed, the gods and spirits worshiped and importuned and so on.\\" Orsi's critique of popular religion Orsi critiques popular religion as being a limited framework and method for studying religion. Orsi claims that popular religion is “unclear, misleading, and tendentious”. Orsi notes that popular religion is concerned only with the practices of \\"common folk\\" and distinguishing popular religion practices as separate from “official religion”. In his introduction to The Madonna on 115th Street, he writes, \\"Popular religion served to seal off certain expressions of religious life from unspecified but obviously normative religion.\\" Orsi is concerned with the limitations of popular religions because he sees it as potentially authorizing legitimacy and boundaries in religious practices and beliefs. For Orsi, the implied intent in popular religion is to highlight the primitive, ignorant, and often marginalized practitioners of popular religion as a means of \\"policing religion\\". Orsi’s scholarly move to lived religion as a theoretical framework was an attempt to provide a more holistic approach to religious studies and also highlights the perspective that \\"religious practices and understandings only have meaning in relations to other cultural forms and in relations to the life experiences and actual circumstance of the people using them\\". David D. Hall David D. Hall has been a faculty member at Harvard Divinity School since 1989. Hall was Bartlett Professor of New England Church History until 2008, when he became Bartlett Research Professor.http://hds.harvard.edu/people/david-d-hall Hall writes extensively on religion and society in seventeenth-century New England and England. Hall edited a series of essays titled Lived Religion In America: Toward a History Of Practice, which is a foundational compilation in the study of lived religion. Hall’s book covers topics including gift exchange, cremation, hymn singing and many other essays on lived and practiced religious belief. Many of Hall's students have gone on to become notable scholars in the field of lived religion. Hall defines lived religion as \\"rooted less in sociology than cultural and ethnographical approaches to the study of religion and American religious history\\". He instead sees lived religion as the study of the context and content about the practices of religious laity and their \\"everyday thinking\\". Hall believes that using lived religion as an approach to the study of religion allows for a wider interpretation of meaning and also provides an opportunity for historians to examine the past and present from many angles. For Hall, lived religion \\"does not depend on any single method or discipline\\". Hall also acknowledges the limitations of lived religion. Hall suggests that as a field, lived religion is \\"fluid, mobile, and incompletely structured\\". Hall calls lived religion an \\"imperfect tool\\" noting that even with a dynamic study of laity it is impossible to fully understand any one person’s religious practices, especially when summarizing from a single location be it time or place. Hall's critique of popular religion Hall distinguishes the study of lived religion from popular religion by saying that popular religion is concerned with hierarchy and opposition in religious beliefs and practices. Hall writes, \\"Popular religion has therefore come to signify the space that emerged between official or learned Christianity and the profane (or ‘pagan’) culture.\\" Hall critiques popular religion as imposing normative perspectives on practices.

It has only been found in two spacecraft assembly clean room facilities and is resistant to the methods normally used to clean such facilities. The species name is derived from tersi, Latin for clean; coccus, Greek for berry; and phoenicis, from NASA's Phoenix lander, the spacecraft being prepared when these bacteria were first discovered.  Occurrence  Tersicoccus phoenicis are only known to exist at two locations on Earth, and were independently found in geographically separated clean room facilities nearly apart. One example was located during a 2007 microbial test swabbing of the Phoenix lander clean room floor in the Payload Hazardous Servicing Facility at Kennedy Space Center (Florida, United States), while the other was found in the Herschel Space Observatory's clean room at Guiana Space Centre (Kourou, French Guiana). Parag Vaishampayan, a microbiologist with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, suggests that this species may exist naturally outside of the clean room environment but has not been seen before due to the difficulty in isolating a single microbe type among the wide variety of different types found in nature.  Characteristics  These bacteria are non-spore-forming, aerobic, non-motile, and Gram-positive. They are roughly spherical (coccus) in shape and measure approximately in diameter. This species maintains a coccal morphology throughout their growth; the rod–coccus life cycle typically observed in nearly all Arthrobacter species is not present. They are able to survive in environments with few nutrients. Two strains of T. phoenicis are known to exist, one at each discovery site: 1P05MAT at the American facility and KO_PS43 at the French Guianan facility.  Significance  Because species like T. phoenicis are hardy enough to survive the sterilization measures used in spacecraft clean rooms, scientists study them and index their genetic material so that if a potential extraterrestrial bacterium were returned to Earth aboard a spacecraft, it could be compared to the index and ruled out as something that may have been originally launched with the spacecraft. Additionally, by examining the characteristics of resistant microbes such as T. phoenicis, scientists may be able to develop improved sterilization methods. This is necessary to prevent the contamination of other celestial bodies by organisms aboard visiting spacecraft, which may have already occurred with the Curiosity rover on Mars.  Recognition  On May 23, 2014, the International Institute for Species Exploration (IISE) declared the bacterium as one of its \\"Top 10 New Species of 2014\\", selected from species discovered in 2013, due to the unusual location of its discovery and resistance to sterilization.

When built, it was the tallest apartment building in the city. The tract at the corner of Fourth Ave. and Lockwood Blvd. was sold to American Mortgage Investment Co. in September 1963 for $61,000. A condition on the sale required at least $500,000 in improvements to be started within two years of the sale. Work began on the building in August 1964 following plans by Lyles, Bissett, Carlylses & Wolff of Columbia, South Carolina. The first floor houses commercial space catering to the needs of residents, and the uppermost floor housed machinery, leaving twelve floors of occupied space. Rent was originally set between $95 and $182 per month. The apartment building had twelve apartments on each of twelve floors. Apartments started being rented in October 1965. In January 1980, the apartments were converted to condominiums.

Several CFL games have been staged in the United States – the earliest was in 1909, and the most recent was in 1995 during the league's short-lived US expansion. In the 2005 preseason, and regular seasons of 2010, 2011 and 2013, games in Atlantic Canada were billed as Touchdown Atlantic. The event was on hiatus from 2014 to 2018, but returned in 2019. In 2013, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats played most of their season in Guelph, Ontario, due to the reconstruction of Tim Hortons Field at the former Ivor Wynne Stadium. In 2015, games were moved to locations including Fort McMurray, Alberta, as some CFL stadiums were used for the Women's World Cup, Pan-American Games and baseball playoffs. List of games Below is a list of games played by teams from the CFL, and its predecessors the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union and Western Interprovincial Football Union, outside the home city of both teams. Note: Not included are Grey Cup games, which are played annually at a neutral site. Also not included are interleague games – for example, games between American football and CFL teams, or games where CFL teams played against Ontario Rugby Football Union, Quebec Rugby Football Union or Canadian Intercollegiate Rugby Football Union. These Unions competed for the Grey Cup, or its predecessor the Canadian Dominion Football Championship, in the early years. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" - bgcolor=\\"#efefef\\" ! Game !! Date !!

The 90-minute program aired on ABC on November 28, 2013, with guest stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Elton John and RuPaul and an appearance by Kristen Bell. It was the second Gaga Thanksgiving special on ABC, after A Very Gaga Thanksgiving in 2011. The singer had previously collaborated with the Muppets on media appearances and in her shows. The special featured songs from Gaga's third studio album, Artpop, and duets with the guest stars. Critics gave the special mixed reviews, with some praising Gaga for being relatable in the show. Other reviewers were disappointed with its lack of production ideas, other than as a promotion for Artpop. It had lower ratings than other Thanksgiving specials, with a total of 3.62 million viewers and a 0.9 rating in the adult age 18–49 demographic. Synopsis Announcer Tom Kane explains to Pepe the King Prawn that the special is being filmed for Lady Gaga, the latter then appears and explains why she invited the Muppets and then performs \\"Venus\\". After Statler and Waldorf's review of the performance, Kristen Bell asks for Gaga's autograph. This annoys Miss Piggy who was planning her own finale and enlists the Muppets to hold auditions. Gaga performs \\"Applause\\", followed by \\"Bennie and the Jets\\" and \\"Artpop\\" with Elton John (with the Muppets joining them for the latter). After discussing ideas for the finale, Gaga performs \\"Manicure\\" and the Muppets talk about the most inappropriate gifts they ever received. Kermit the Frog joins Gaga in a duet of \\"Gypsy\\", and Joseph Gordon-Levitt duets on \\"Baby, It's Cold Outside\\". Kermit's friendship with Gaga angers Miss Piggy; after a performance of \\"Fashion!\\" by Gaga and RuPaul, Miss Piggy bemoans the attention paid to the singer. Although she dreams of singing \\"Santa Baby\\", she is upstaged in her dream by Youthful Praise. After a trailer for the upcoming Muppets Most Wanted, Gaga asks Miss Piggy to suggest a finale and reprises \\"Applause\\" with the Muppets. Production Gaga at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, where Kermit the Frog was her date In October 2013, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) announced a 90-minute special entitled Lady Gaga and the Muppets' Holiday Spectacular. It was the second Thanksgiving television special on ABC by Gaga, after A Very Gaga Thanksgiving in 2011. The singer collaborated with the Muppets for the special, which aired on November 28, 2013. \\"I was so excited when ABC called me about doing a holiday special this year. I knew it just wouldn't be a complete night of laughter and memories without the Muppets! Can't wait to see the gang again, and I hope Miss Piggy's still not mad about Kermit ... We're just friends,\\" Gaga said about the special. Guest stars included Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Elton John and RuPaul, with an appearance by Kristen Bell. Gaga performed several songs from her third studio album, Artpop. The singer had collaborated twice with the Muppets in the past; in 2009 Kermit the Frog was her date at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, and she featured Jim Henson's Creature Shop pieces on the Monster Ball Tour (2009–2011). The special was described in press releases as \\"an avant-garde twist on the classic holiday variety show as Lady Gaga goes backstage with the Muppets, making a performance dream come true for the multi-platinum singer-songwriter when they combine forces to sing holiday favorites and Lady Gaga hits\\". It was confirmed that holiday classics like \\"Deck the Halls\\" and \\"Jingle Bells\\" would be performed by the Muppets, as well as songs from Artpop. A promotional tie-in with the special was the trailer for Muppets Most Wanted, in which Gaga made a cameo appearance. Kory Grow of Rolling Stone called the special a \\"fitting move\\" for the singer, since she was releasing Artpop and the Muppets frequently collaborated with celebrities. The special was acquired by Channel 5 in the United Kingdom, with Dayna Donaldson of the network describing it as \\"a high energy and truly unique musical show full of fun\\". After its broadcast, it was obtained by Netflix Canada for 13 months of streaming. Previews of the show, uploaded on Gaga's Instagram account, showed the singer performing \\"Applause\\" and planning a party for the special's finale. Reception=Ratings The special had 3.62 million viewers and a 0.9 rating in the adult age 18-49 demographic. Its rating was lower than A Very Gaga Thanksgiving, which had a 1.6 rating in the same demographic and 5.4 million viewers. The total rating was the same as Glee, which was concurrently broadcast on Fox. It was down by 25% than the 2012 Thanksgiving special, Bad 25. The rating was adjusted to 1.0 by Nielsen ratings. In comparison, ABC's annual telecast of A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving before Gaga's special was watched by 5.4 million viewers and had a 1.6 rating in the 18–49 demographic. Critical response According to Marissa G. Muller of Rolling Stone, Gaga \\"was at her most accessible during the show, sharing the difficulties of life on the road and her love of the holidays – specifically, how she grew up watching the Muppets and has had a long love for Kermit. The whole affair was relatively conservative for Gaga and weirdly progressive for the Muppets\\". Muller wrote that the special was aired at an opportune moment for Gaga, since Artpop sales had dropped 82 percent in its second week and the show was hoped to woo back her audience. She called the opening performance of \\"Venus\\" one of its top moments. Mark Graham wrote for VH1 that Gaga had a lack of relatability at that point in her career: \\"To her credit, [she] seems to have recognized this flaw in her brand strategy and has been working overtime of late to humanize herself ... [Anyone] who watches the cable premiere of Lady Gaga & The Muppets Holiday Spectacular ... will definitely gain a new appreciation for [her]\\". Maricela Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly called Lady Gaga and the Muppets' Holiday Spectacular a \\"cross-promotional commercial\\", enabling Gaga to promote Artpop and enhancing the Muppets' popularity. Gonzalez described it as \\"equal parts warm, fuzzy, cynical, and depressed by consumerism overtaking the so-called 'holiday spirit'. But why fret? It’s Lady Gaga and the Muppets!\\" Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club gave the special a grade of C, criticizing it as a mere promotional vehicle for Gaga with the Muppets feeling like a last-minute addition. The production was unable to balance Gaga's album promotion with a Muppets holiday special: \\"Nothing in Lady Gaga & The Muppets' Holiday Spectacular destroys the sanctity of the Muppets ... However, the potential for a Muppets holiday special was never given room to materialize amidst a Lady Gaga concert special designed to sell her new album. The choice to combine the two may have reached out to a broader audience, but the incongruence of the special's various parts ... was bound to frustrate a sizable portion of that audience.\\" Todd Martens of the Los Angeles Times agreed, criticizing the special's commercial nature; he also said its songs were \\"less fit for a Muppet-like music special, and no one seemed willing to stray too far from the show's message of selling a product. Rather than aim for holiday timelessness, this was self-promotion, with the Muppets often coming to Gaga's world than the other way around.\\" Billboards Chris Willman also gave it a negative review, citing the show's palpably-low budget and its dialogue, guest appearances, Gaga's lip-syncing and production: \\"If the 90 seemingly endless minutes of Lady Gaga and the Muppets Holiday Spectacular had a predecessor, it might be the long-suppressed Star Wars Christmas Special , though nothing here was so outrageously wrong (or right) that people will still be bootlegging this one in 35 years' time. At least there was a familiar 'why is this happening?' question hovering over the star-crossed proceedings, albeit without the benefit of any guest stars as seriously wacky as that one's to show up and redeem the incongruousness. We knew Bea Arthur - we were friends with Bea Arthur - and RuPaul, you're no Bea Arthur.\\" Personnel Credits adapted from the special itself. * Lady Gaga as herself * Tom Kane as the Announcer Muppet performers * Steve Whitmire as Kermit the Frog, Beaker, Rizzo the Rat, Statler and Lips * Eric Jacobson as Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Animal and Sam Eagle * Dave Goelz as The Great Gonzo, Bunsen Honeydew, Waldorf, Zoot and Albert the Rabbit * Bill Barretta as Rowlf the Dog, Dr. Teeth, Swedish Chef, Pepe the King Prawn, Bobo the Bear and Big Mean Carl * David Rudman as Scooter and Janice * Matt Vogel as Camilla the Chicken, Floyd Pepper, Lew Zealand and Norman the Sheep * Peter Linz as Walter Guest appearances * Kristen Bell as herself * Joseph Gordon-Levitt as himself * Elton John as himself * RuPaul as himself * Youthful Praise as themselves See also * List of Thanksgiving television specials ReferencesExternal links * Category:2010s American television specials Category:2013 television specials Category:American Broadcasting Company television specials Category:Disney television specials Category:Lady Gaga Category:Thanksgiving television specials Category:The Muppets television specials Category:Variety shows ","title":"Lady Gaga and the Muppets Holiday Spectacular"},{"id":"41003061","text":"Xenotransfusion (from Greek xenos- strange or foreign), a form of xenotransplantation, was initially defined as the transfer of blood from one species into the veins of another. In most cases, it is a transfer of blood between a non-human animal and a human. However, further experimentation has been done between various non-human animal species. This procedure can be performed without affecting the health of the donor, as only about 10% of their blood volume is used each time. Utilizing the unlimited blood supply from animal sources eliminates the risk of transmitting infectious diseases between humans. In 1658, Dom Robert des Gabets, a French monk, introduced the idea of xenotransfusion at a scientific society meeting. This society later afforded the French Academy of Sciences. Currently there are not any laws prohibiting the practice of xenotransfusion, but some ethical issues have been identified by the Ethics Committee of the International Xenotransplantation Association (IXA). For example, the IXA sets standards and regulations for those planning to orchestrate clinical xenotransplantation trials. The IXA has identified three major ethical areas that require adequate attention: favorable risk and benefit assessment supported by pre-clinical data, lack of alternative treatment for participants, and minimizing the risk of infection by ensuring the highest biosafety regulations are followed for selected animal donors. These are just a few examples of the ethics behind xenotransplantation. History Jean-Baptiste Denis, a French physician, and Paul Emmerez, a surgeon, performed the first documented xenotransfusion on June 15, 1667. The transfusion occurred between a lamb and a 15-year-old boy. Carotid artery blood from the lamb was introduced to a vein in the patient’s inner elbow, and the procedure ultimately resulted in a successful recovery. Denis and Emmerez performed multiple xenotransfusions together. On June 24, 1667, the duo performed a transfusion on a young Swedish nobleman. When they arrived, the patient had already lost his ability to speak and was practically unconscious. Shortly after the transfusion began, the patient was able to speak again. His health was improving until his condition grew progressively worse. A second transfusion took place, but it was unsuccessful, and the patient died. Richard Lower, an English physician, performed a similar procedure on November 23, 1667. He successfully transfused the blood of a lamb to a 22-year-old man. In both cases, the whole blood of the lamb was directly introduced into the vein of the patient. The direct introduction of blood was due to a lack of knowledge in preventative blood coagulation techniques at the time. After several xenotransfusion procedures, some successful some not, the French Parliament prohibited the practice of these transfusions in 1670. The English Parliament, as well as the Pope, followed suit and prohibited the procedures shortly after. Ethical arguments involving the pig for xenotransfusion Xenotransfusion uses non-human animals to aid in the shortage of blood for blood transfusion in humans. Although there needs to be more study on the topic some scientists are already considering the idea to use Sus scrofa domesticus (pigs) for blood transfusion. To come up with this answer they tested many animals to see which one was the best candidate for blood donation. As a result, pig red blood cells (pRBCs) showed more characteristics similar to that of a human. Starting with RBC diameters (pig 6 μm: human 7.2 μm) and RBC counts (pig 5.7 to 6.9 million/ll; human 4.2 to 6.2 million/ll) and, RBC average lifespan (86 vs. 120 days). Current evidence shows that pRBCs will function normally in humans due to a relation between porcine blood groups and human ABO group system. In addition, it is possible to produce pigs with type O blood and it is also possible to genetically modify the pig to make its blood more compatible with humans. Sus scrofa domesticus’s blood will be used to save lives and to increase blood quantity. The organism will be kept alive and no serious harm will be involved in XTF. It will be similar to how blood is removed from humans. Only 10% of the animal’s blood volume will be used each time, therefore, it is ethically acceptable to raise pigs for periodical blood collection as it does not damage the health of the animal. It will also be ethical to use pRBCs on humans since it will not cause a severe harm on human’s health. At the moment XTF is not a real necessity because a lot of people are willing to donate their blood and there is not a significant shortage on blood. However, it represents a great opportunity for new science as well as an unlimited blood bank for blood transfusions. Veterinary xenotransfusion Transfusion of canine blood into domestic cats was performed historically and continues to be performed in some countries. Xenotransfusions have been performed on birds, though the procedure is only done to stabilize a bird in shock, due to rejection by the recipient bird's antibodies.

The bridge is located close to the village of Maurzyce near Łowicz in Łódź Voivodeship. History= Design  The bridge was designed in 1927 by Stefan Bryła, one of the pioneers of welding in civil engineering. Bryła, a professor at the Lwów University of Technology, conducted extensive theoretical studies on possible usage of welded steel joints in construction, as well as various aspects of oxy-fuel welding and electric arc welding. Both procedures have been known at least since late 19th century, but their application was mostly limited to house and shipbuilding. However, since the tests proved welded joints could be strong enough to sustain large forces, in mid-1920s Bryła decided to design a welded bridge. He used his earlier design of a riveted bridge, which Bryła and Wenczesław Poniż converted to use the new construction method. However, the cross-beams and some elements of the chords were re-designed from scratch. Although designed first, the bridge was the second such bridge constructed; a similar yet shorter welded railway bridge was designed and build a few months earlier in Turtle Creek, Pennsylvania by Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing and holds the record for the first welded bridge of any type in the world. The then-new technique of arc welding allowed considerable weight savings: its overall weight is 56 metric tons, while a riveted version would have weighed over 70 tons. Apart from construction method, the construction itself is an ordinary truss bridge with two main truss beams, a straight bottom chord and a parabolic top chord. In addition to two lanes for road traffic, the bridge also includes two side-walks for pedestrians.  Construction  Ground level view As the task of building such a structure was considered extremely risky, the K. Rudzki i S-ka Company was chosen as the main contractor, fabricator and builder. The company with its seat in Warsaw and a large factory in Mińsk Mazowiecki was among the most experienced bridge building companies in Central and Eastern Europe at the time. Established in 1853, in late 19th and early 20th century the company was the only firm in the entire Russian Empire to construct difficult bridges in remote locations. Almost 20% of all bridges constructed in Russia in that period were built by Konstanty Rudzki and his engineers. Altogether in the first two decades of 20th century the company built 5,000 metres of steel road bridges and 24,000 metres of various rail bridges for 37 different railway companies, in addition to providing them with a net of over 2 million metres of water pipelines. Among the steel bridges constructed by K. Rudzki were Warsaw's Poniatowski Bridge, but also most of Trans-Siberian Railway's river crossings, including the 1916 Khabarovsk Bridge (at over 2,500 metres of length for decades the longest bridge in Euro-Asia). The company also built bridges for the Saint Petersburg–Warsaw Railway, Amur Railway, Ussuri Railway and Chinese Eastern Railway, among others. Yet, even with such experience, the construction of the bridge across Słudwia near Łowicz proved to be a difficult task. The elements were manufactured by the K. Rudzki i S-ka factory in Mińsk Mazowiecki and then welded into place on the spot. It was completed in December 1928 and opened to normal road traffic in August of the following year. Despite welding being much more expensive than time-consuming riveting, the overall bridge cost was much lower, in large part due to 17% less steel needed to build it and shorter construction time.  Later history  Revolutionary at the time, the completion of the Maurzyce Bridge sparked a new era in bridge construction worldwide. The construction was described in European and American engineering press, and engineers from around the world visited the new bridge in large numbers. Consequently, Poland was the first country in the world to regulate the construction of welded bridges. Until the late 1970s the bridge was used by National road 2, the Polish section of the European route E8. However, as it proved too narrow, in 1977 it was moved some 20 metres to the north, closed to traffic, and a new replacement was built in its place. The bridge was inscribed on the list of objects of cultural heritage in Poland on 22 November 1968 by the Monument Documentation Authority (predecessor to the National Heritage Board), and initially (until that category was abolished in 1973) it was listed among the \\"Grade Zero monuments\\" (), that is the most prized historical monuments of international significance. Later it was re-classified as an \\"unmovable historical monument\\". The bridge was refurbished in 2009. At the cost of 800,000 zł the steel construction was cleaned of rust and repainted silver, and the road surface was replaced with a granite sett. In 2011 a memorial plaque to professor Bryła was unveiled in front of it.

It was part of the traditional region of Upper Carniola and is now included with the rest of the municipality in the Central Slovenia Statistical Region. Geography Kaplja Vas is an elongated village stretching along the road from Komenda to Moste. It lies above the Pšata River. The village has extensive fields but limited wooded land. Name Kaplja Vas was originally named Kapela vas ('chapel village') in reference to a chapel dedicated to Saint Peter that was later developed into a church (now in Komenda). Until about 1800, the hamlet below the church was known as Apnenice. In the past the German name of the village was Kaplawas. History Fragments of prehistoric pottery, roof tiles and remains of walls from antiquity, and a Roman coin from AD 276–283 have been discovered in Kaplja Vas, attesting to early settlement in the area. Continuity of settlement is indicated by the discovery of early Slavic graves near the parish church and a fragment of a quern.Ciraj, Marta et al. 2006. Po poteh kulturne dediščine v Občini Komenda. Komenda: Občina, pp. 111–112. In the past, Kaplja Vas produced large quantities of wine; the village also had two grain mills and two sawmills. During the Second World War, the Partisans operated an underground print shop at the Mejač farm in Kaplja Vas from the end of March to mid-May 1944, after which it was relocated to Mlaka. A Home Guard post was established in the village in mid-August 1944. Kaplja Vas was annexed by the village of Komenda in 1952, ending its existence as an independent settlement.Spremembe naselij 1948–95. 1996. Database. Ljubljana: Geografski inštitut ZRC SAZU, DZS.

He took part in the Battle of Aluminé, against the Chilean Army, and also in the defense of the National Government during the Revolution of '90. His military career includes his services during the Conquest of the Desert, where he took part in the main military actions against the Mapuche Chiefs.  Career  The Argentine Army on the banks of the Río Negro, c.1879. He was born in Buenos Aires, the son of Francisco Canaveris and Ofelia Segrestán, belonging to a Creole family of French descent. He completed his elementary studies in the city, and began his military career after the death of his father. He was enlisted in the 2° Regimiento de Caballería de Línea (2nd Line Cavalry Regiment), towards the year of 1875, serving as alférez in Guaminí, province of Buenos Aires. He took part in several clashes between the Argentine army and the Pampas tribes, highlighting his actions in the Combat of the Sierra de Currumalán (Coronel Suárez). In 1878, Saturnino Canaveri served as a lieutenant, taking part of Campaigns to the desert organized by the Ejército Argentino against the aborigines. He was commissioned to pursue the cacique Ancapi Ñancucheo, a brave chief of Pehuenche origin, who had his huts on the Chimehuin River. He also participated in the persecution of Antener (brave chief of Boroano origin), and led an expedition of forty soldiers, in the Chimehuin River. The expedition counted on two baqueanos who officiated as guides. After completing his military services as an expeditionary to the Desert, he arrived at the Port of Buenos Aires aboard the Villarino Steam from Patagonia on May 9, 1883. He had served in the detachment the General Roca about five years, and began to provide services in Buenos Aires since June 1883. His military missions include, the Battle of Aluminé, who was occurred on February 18, 1883, during tasks of exploration and topographical recognition, commanding by General Conrado Villegas in the Río Negro and Neuquén. Saturnino Canaveri was also involved in civil conflicts of the Argentina. During the Revolution of the Park remained loyal to the government, participating actively in the operations commanded by the General Nicolás Levalle against the revolutionaries. He obtained his promotion to captain in 1885, and promoted to major on June 26, 1888. In 1892 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel, becoming part of the reserve forces of the Argentine army in 1896. He also served for some years as a lieutenant colonel in the Córdoba Brigade, under the command of General Ignacio Fotheringham. In his long military career, Saturnino Canaveri was awarded several medals for his participation in the military campaigns of Río Negro, Chaco Province, Junín de los Andes, Buenos Aires Province and San Luis. He was retired from the army with the rank of lieutenant colonel on January 5, 1900, after thirty-three years of active service.  Family  Saturnino Canaveri was married to her cousin Carmen Canavery, daughter of Adolfo Canavery and Carmen Martínez, belonging to an old family of Carmen de Areco. He and his wife were the parents of Aurora, Ana María and Maria Esther Canaveri, born in 1898. Saturnino Canaveri belonged to distinguished families whose ancestors and relatives had served in the Army during the colonial and post colonial period of Argentina. His great grandfather Manuel Canaveris, an lieutenant of the Regiment of Patricians, had a short but distinguished military career initiated during the English Invasions, and finished during the period of the War of Independence. His grandfather Sinforoso Canaveri (1808-1872) also served in the army as second lieutenant in the 4° Batallón de Infanteria, and in Batallón de Voluntarios Rebajados de Buenos Aires, a military unit of Juan Manuel de Rosas, formed with former members of the Desert Campaigns of 1830. His father and grandfather, and his relatives Juan Manuel Canaveris and Feliciano Canaveris took part in the Argentine Civil War. Francisco Canaveris is cited with Alejandro Danel in \\"Ensayo histórico de la defensa de Buenos Aires: contra la rebelion del ex-coronel D. Hilario Lagos\\", a historical book about the Argentine civil wars, written by José Luis Bustamante. Saturnino Canaveri was a descendant of Domingo Brignole Pelliza, born by 1700 in Genoa, who served as Mayordomo in the Cabildo de Buenos Aires. His maternal paternal great- grandfather had been the sergeant major Francisco Pelliza, an honorable member of the Argentine army, who participated in the wars for independence. Through the Pelliza family his genealogy is linked to the Pueyrredón-Dogan and Wilde's family. He was brother of Héctor Canaveri and cousin of Ángel Canavery, two outstanding members of the army. He was related-in-law of Juan Gregorio Lemos, a patriot who served under General José de San Martin, and also of Baldomero Lamela Luengo, an officer of the army who had participated in the Paraguayan War. In 1945, his daughter Aurora Canaveri de González, was awarded a pension for the services provided by his father as Expeditionary to the Desert by decree signed by President Edelmiro Julián Farrell, and the Minister of War Juan Perón. Possibly his paternal ancestors in fifth or sixth generation were from Western and Central Europe. By the end of the 19th century his relatives settled in various places in the southern part of Greater Buenos Aires, including Adrogué, Banfield, Burzaco, Lomas de Zamora, Temperley. His great grandfather Juan Domingo Jugluns de Canaverys, settled in the San Nicolás neighborhood since his arrival in Buenos Aires in 1772, and owned land in the town of Quilmes since the colonial period.

He researches in the area of preterm births, intra-amniotic infection or inflammation and fetal damage. For his theoretical and clinical academic achievements he received the Prize of the Korea Science & Technology Award in 2012. Education Yoon was born in Seoul, South Korea and grew up there. He graduated from the medical college of Seoul National University in 1979, where he received his M.D. and Ph.D. After a residency in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the same college he joined the faculty there from 1988 until the present. Work Yoon's work focused on “intrauterine infection/inflammation, prematurity and fetal damage”, which is one of the most important challenges to medicine. Cerebral palsy is a serious motor disorder which frequently appears in preterm newborn babies, and has been traditionally linked to hypoxic obstetric events. However, many studies demonstrated a limited role for birth hypoxia in the etiology of cerebral palsy. From 1996, Yoon and his colleagues provided strong clinical and experimental evidence that intrauterine infection/inflammation, which is causally linked to preterm birth, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of fetal brain damage and cerebral palsy. Moreover, they demonstrated that intrauterine infection/inflammation is an important risk factor for the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia which is one of the most frequent and significant complications of preterm newborns. These have important implications because the two most important complications of preterm newborns, cerebral palsy and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, seem to be initiated before birth in some, and can be prevented and treated from in utero. Over the last twenty years, Yoon and his colleagues have published a number of important articles in the area of preterm births, intra-amniotic infection/inflammation and fetal damage. His papers have been cited extensively in the literature, making his H-index 60 as of September 2014. He invented MMP-8 bedside test which identifies intra-amniotic infection/inflammation in patients at risk for preterm birth. He and his co-workers have applied the results of his investigation to clinical fields. For example, The outcomes of preterm neonates who were born in Seoul National University Hospital have been improved noticeably since they actively diagnosed and treated intrauterine infection with new regimen of antibiotics they developed.  Awards  For his scientific achievement Yoon received the First Paper Prize Award of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (1993), the Gwanghye Prize from Korean Medical Association (1994), the Certificate of the Prize for Outstanding Thesis from the Korean Federation of Science and Technology Societies (1995), the Best Paper Award from the Korean Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology (1995), and the Award for Research Excellence of the International Society for Perinatal Obstetricians (1996). He also achieved the Awards for Research Excellence of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (1999), the Best Researcher Award from the Seoul National University Hospital (1999), Namyang Academic Award from the Korean Society of Perinatology (2009), Bumsuk Prize from Bumsuk Academic Scholarship Foundation (2012), and the Prize of the Korea Science & Technology Award (2012).

It also covers the economic mobilization of labor, industry, and agriculture leading to economic failure. It deals with economic warfare such as the blockade of Germany, and with some issues closely related to the economy, such as military issues of transportation. For a broader perspective see Home front during World War I. All of the powers in 1914 expected a short war; none had made any economic preparations for a long war, such as stockpiling food or critical raw materials. The longer the war went on, the more the advantages went to the Allies, with their larger, deeper, more versatile economies and better access to global supplies. As Stephen Broadberry and Mark Harrison conclude, once stalemate set in late in 1914: \\"The greater Allied capacity for taking risks, absorbing the cost of mistakes, replacing losses, and accumulating overwhelming quantitative superiority should eventually have turned the balance against Germany\\".Stephen Broadberry and Mark Harrison, eds. The Economics of World War I (2005) ch 1 online p 2 The Allies had much more potential wealth they could spend on the war. One estimate (using 1913 US dollars) is that the Allies spent $147 billion on the war and the Central Powers only $61 billion. Among the Allies, Britain and its Empire spent $47 billion and the U.S. $27 billion (America joined after the war started) while among the Central Powers, Germany spent $45 billion.H.E. Fisk, The Inter- Allied Debts (1924) pp 13 & 325 reprinted in Horst Menderhausen, The Economics of War (1943 edition), appendix table II Total war demanded total mobilization of all the nation's resources for a common goal. Manpower had to be channeled into the front lines (all the powers except the United States and Britain had large trained reserves designed just for that). Behind the lines labour power had to be redirected away from less necessary activities that were luxuries during total war. In particular, vast munitions industries had to be built up to provide shells, guns, warships, uniforms, airplanes, and a hundred other weapons both old and new. Agriculture had to provide food for both civilians and for soldiers (some of whom had been farmers and needed to be replaced by women, children and the elderly who now did the work without animal assistance) and for horses to move supplies. Transportation, in general, was a challenge, especially when Britain and Germany each tried to intercept merchant ships headed for the enemy. Finance was a special challenge. Germany financed the Central Powers. Britain financed the Allies until 1916 when it ran out of money and had to borrow from the United States. The U.S. took over the financing of the Allies in 1917 with loans that it insisted be repaid after the war. The victorious Allies looked to defeated Germany in 1919 to pay reparations that would cover some of their costs. Above all, it was essential to conduct the mobilization in such a way that the short term confidence of the people was maintained, the long-term power of the political establishment was upheld, and the long-term economic health of the nation was preserved.Gerd Hardach, First World War: 1914–1918 (1981) Europe Gross domestic product (GDP) increased for three Allies (Britain, Italy, and the U.S.), but decreased in France and Russia, in the neutral Netherlands, and in the three main Central Powers. The shrinkage in GDP in Austria, Russia, France, and the Ottoman Empire reached 30 to 40%. In Austria, for example, most pigs were slaughtered, so at war's end there was no meat. The Western Front quickly stabilized, with almost no movement of more than a few hundred yards. The greatest single expenditure on both sides was for artillery shells, the chief weapon in the war. Since the front was highly stable, both sides built elaborate railway networks that brought supplies within a mile or two of the front lines, with horse-drawn wagons used for the final deliveries. In the ten-month battle at Verdun, the French and Germans fired some 10 million shells in all, weighing 1.4 million tons of steel.John Horn, ed. Companion to World War I (2012) pp 58, 218 Allies The German counter-blockade with U-Boats was defeated by the convoy system and massive American shipbuilding. Britain paid the war costs of most of its Allies until it ran out of money, then the US took over, funding those Allies and Britain as well.David Stevenson, With Our Backs to the Wall: Victory and Defeat in 1918 (2011) pp 350–438 United Kingdom Woolwich Arsenal, London The economy (in terms of GDP) grew about 7% from 1914 to 1918 despite the absence of so many men in the services; by contrast the German economy shrank 27%. The War saw a decline of civilian consumption, with a major reallocation to munitions. The government share of GDP soared from 8% in 1913 to 38% in 1918 (compared to 50% in 1943).Niall Ferguson, The Pity of War (1998) p 249 Despite fears in 1916 that munitions production was lagging, the output was more than adequate. The annual output of artillery grew from 91 guns in 1914 to 8039 in 1918. Warplanes soared from 200 in 1914 to 3200 in 1918, while the production of machine guns went from 300 to 121,000.Paul Kennedy, The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers (1987) p 267 In 1915, the Anglo-French Financial Commission agreed a $500 million loan from private American banks. By 1916, Britain was funding most of the Empire's war expenditures, all of Italy's and two thirds of the war costs of France and Russia, plus smaller nations as well. The gold reserves, overseas investments and private credit then ran out forcing Britain to borrow $4 billion from the U.S. Treasury in 1917–18.Steven Lobell, \\"The Political Economy of War Mobilization: From Britain's Limited Liability to a Continental Commitment,\\" International Politics (2006) 43#3 pp 283–304 Shipments of American raw materials and food allowed Britain to feed itself and its army while maintaining her productivity. The financing was generally successful,M. J.

Mitchell, Abstract of British Historical Statistics (1962) p 371 Trade unions were encouraged as membership grew from 4.1 million in 1914 to 6.5 million in 1918, peaking at 8.3 million in 1920 before relapsing to 5.4 million in 1923.Mitchell, Abstract of British Historical Statistics (1962) p 68 Women were available and many entered munitions factories and took other home front jobs vacated by men.Gail Braybon, Women Workers in the First World War: The British Experience (1990) =Energy= Energy was a critical factor for the British war effort. Most of the energy supplies came from coal mines in Britain, where the issue was labour supply. Critical however was the flow of oil for ships, lorries and industrial use. There were no oil wells in Britain so everything was imported. The U.S. pumped two-thirds of the world's oil. In 1917, total British consumption was 827 million barrels, of which 85 percent was supplied by the United States, and 6 percent by Mexico.Harold F. Williamson, The American Petroleum Industry: the Age of Energy 1899-1959 (1963) 2:267 The great issue in 1917 was how many tankers would survive the German u-boats. Convoys and the construction of new tankers solved the German threat, while tight government controls guaranteed that all essential needs were covered. An Inter-Allied Petroleum Conference allocated American supplies to Britain, France and Italy.Daniel Yergin, The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power (1991) pp 176-77 An oil crisis occurred in Britain due to the 1917 German submarine campaign. Standard Oil of NJ, for example, lost 6 tankers (including the brand new John D. Archbold) between May and September. The only solution to the crisis lay with increased oil shipment from America. The Allies formed the Inter-Allied Petroleum Conference with USA, Britain, France, and Italy as the members. Standard and Royal Dutch/Shell ran it and made it work. The introduction of convoys as an antidote to the German U-boats and the joint management system by Standard Oil and Royal Dutch/Shell helped to solve the Allies' supply problems. The close working relationship that evolved was in marked contrast to the feud between the government and Standard Oil years earlier. In 1917 and 1918, there was increased domestic demand for oil partly due to the cold winter that created a shortage of coal. Inventories and imported oil from Mexico were used to close the gap. In January 1918, the U.S. Fuel Administrator ordered industrial plants east of Mississippi to close for a week to free up oil for Europe. Fuel oil for the Royal Navy was the highest priority. In 1917, the Royal Navy consumed 12,500 tons a month, but had a supply of 30,000 tons a month from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, using their oil wells in Persia. =Scotland= Clydeside shipyards before 1914 had been the busiest in the world, turning out more than a third of the entire British output. They expanded by a third during the war, primarily to produce transports of the sort that German U-boats were busy sinking. Confident of postwar expansion, the companies borrowed heavily to expand their facilities. But after the war, employment tumbled as the yards proved too big, too expensive, and too inefficient; in any case world demand was down. The most skilled craftsmen were especially hard hit, because there were few alternative uses for their specialized skills.Lewis Johnman and Hugh Murphy, \\"An Overview of the Economic and Social Effects of the Interwar Depression on Clydeside Shipbuilding Communities,\\" International Journal of Maritime History, (2006), 18#1 pp 227–254 =Ireland= Ireland was on the verge of civil war in 1914 after Parliament voted a home rule law that was intensely opposed by Unionists, especially those in Ulster. When the war broke out the law was suspended and Protestants gave very strong support for the war in terms of military service and industrial output.G. R. Searle, A New England?: Peace and War 1886-1918 (New Oxford History of England, 2005), pp 424-34, 753-54.J.J. Lee, Ireland, 1912-1985: Politics and Society (1990) pp. 1-43. Occurring during Ireland's Revolutionary period, the Irish Nationalist experience of the war was complex and its memory of it divisive. At the outbreak of the war, most Irish people, regardless of political affiliation, supported the war in much the same way as their British counterparts, and both nationalist and unionist leaders initially backed the British war effort. Their followers, both Catholic and Protestant, served extensively in the British forces, many in three specially raised divisions. Over 200,000 Irishmen fought in the war, in several theatres with 30,000 deaths. In 1916, supporters of Irish independence from the United Kingdom took the opportunity of the ongoing war to proclaim an Irish Republic and to defend it in an armed rebellion against British rule in Dublin. The rebellion was poorly planned and quickly suppressed. After summary Courts Martial, the British executed 15 of the prisoners/https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/heritage/easter-rising-1916-the- aftermath-arrests-and-executions-1.2583019> which caused public opinion to surge in favour of independence. Britain's intention to impose conscription in Ireland in 1918 provoked widespread resistance and as a result remained unimplemented.Keith Jeffery, Ireland and the Great War (2011). =Commonwealth and British Empire= The Commonwealth nations and India all played major roles. The Asian and African colonies provided large numbers of civilian workers, as well as some soldiers. The Indian Army during World War I contributed a large number of divisions and independent brigades to the European, Mediterranean and the Middle East theatres of war. Over one million Indian troops served overseas, of whom 62,000 died and another 67,000 were wounded.Ian Sumner, The Indian Army 1914–1947 (Osprey, 2001). Canada Canada was prosperous during the war but ethnic conflict escalated almost out of control. In terms of long-run economic trends, the war hardly affected the direction or the speed of change. The trajectory of the main economic factors, the business and financial system, and the technology continued on their way. Women temporarily took war jobs, and at the end of the war there was a great deal of unrest among union members and farmers for a few years.Douglas McCalla, \\"The Economic Impact of the Great War,\\" in Canada and the First World War, edited by David MacKenzie (2005): 138–153, esp. p. 148 Australia The Australian Honour Flag, awarded to subscribers of the Australian Government's 7th War Loan in 1918 Billy Hughes, prime minister from October 1915, expanded the government's role in the economy, while dealing with intense debates over the issue of conscription.Kosmas Tsokhas, \\"The Forgotten Economy and Australia's Involvement in the Great War,\\" Diplomacy & Statecraft (1993) 4#2 331-357 Historian Gerhard Fisher argues that the Hughes government aggressively promoted economic, industrial, and social modernization. However, Fischer also says it was done by means of exclusion and repression. He says the war turned a peaceful nation into \\"one that was violent, aggressive, angst- and conflict-ridden, torn apart by invisible front lines of sectarian division, ethnic conflict and socio-economic and political upheaval.\\"Gerhard Fischer, \\"'Negative integration' and an Australian road to modernity: Interpreting the Australian homefront experience in World War I,\\" Australian Historical Studies, (April 1995) 26#104 pp 452-76 In 1914 the Australian economy was small but the population of five million was very nearly the most prosperous in the world per capita. The nation depended on the export of wool, mutton, wheat and minerals. London provided assurances that it would underwrite the war risk insurance for shipping in order to allow trade amongst the Commonwealth to continue in the face of the German u-boat threat. London imposed controls so that no exports would wind up in German hands. The British government protected prices by buying Australian products even though the shortage of shipping meant that there was no chance that they would ever receive them. On the whole Australian commerce expanded.Thorough coverage is in Ernest Scott, Australia During the War (1941) pp 480-738; see pp 516-18, 539. In terms of value, Australian exports rose almost 45 per cent, while the number of Australians employed in the manufacturing industry increased over 11 per cent. Iron mining and steel manufacture grew enormously.Russel Ward, A nation for a continent: The history of Australia, 1901-1975 (1977) p 110 Inflation became a factor as consumer prices went up, while the cost of exports was deliberately kept lower than market value in an effort to prevent further inflationary pressures worldwide. As a result, the cost of living for many average Australians was increased.Scott, Australia During the War (1936) pp. 549, 563 The trade union movement, already powerful grew rapidly, though the movement split on the political question of conscription. Despite the considerable rises in the costs of many basic items, the government sought to stabilize wages, much to the anger of unionists. the average weekly wage during the war was increased by between 8–12 per cent, it was not enough to keep up with inflation and as a result there was considerable discontent amongst workers, to the extent that industrial action followed. Not all of these disputes were due to economic factors, and indeed in some part they were the result of violent opposition to the issue of conscription, which many trade unionists were opposed to.Scott 1941, p. 663. Nevertheless, the result was very disruptive and it has been estimated that between 1914 and 1918 there were 1,945 industrial disputes, resulting in 8,533,061 working days lost and £4,785,607 in lost wages.Scott, Australia During the War (1941) pp. 663-65Russel Ward, A nation for a continent: The history of Australia, 1901-1975 (1977) p 110-11 The cost of the war was £377 million, of which 70% was borrowed and the rest came from taxes.Scott, Australia During the War (1941) p. 495 Overall, the war had a significantly negative impact on the Australia economy. Real aggregate Gross Domestic Product (GDP) declined by 9.5 percent over the period 1914 to 1920, while the mobilization of personnel resulted in a 6 percent decline in civilian employment. Meanwhile, although population growth continued during the war years, it was only half that of the prewar rate. Per capita incomes also declined sharply, failing by 16 percent.Ian W. McLean, Why Australia Prospered: The Shifting Sources of Economic Growth (2013), pp. 147–148. South Africa South Africa's main economic role was in the supply of two-thirds of the gold production in the British Empire (most of the remainder came from Australia). When the war began Bank of England officials worked with the government of South Africa to block any gold shipments to Germany, and force the mine owners to sell only to the Treasury, at prices set by the Treasury. This facilitated purchases of munitions and food in the U.S, and other neutrals. By 1919 London lost control to the mining companies (which were now backed by the South African government). They wanted the higher prices and sales to New York that a free market would provide.Russell Ally, \\"War and gold--the Bank of England, the London gold market and South Africa's gold, 1914-19,\\" Journal of Southern African Studies (1991) 17#2 pp 221-38 in JSTOR Belgium Destroyed houses in Dinant, 1915. Belgium sustained significant material damage, providing a major obstacle to its economic recovery after the war. The Germans invaded Belgium at the start of the war and Belgium remained occupied for the entire war. There was both large-scale spontaneous militant and passive resistance. Over a 1.4 million refugees fled to France or to neutral Netherlands.E.H. Kossmann. The Low Countries (1978), p 523-35 Over half the German regiments in Belgium were involved in major incidents.John Horne and Alan Kramer, German Atrocities, 1914: A History of Denial (Yale U.P. 2001) ch 1-2, esp. p. 76 After the atrocities by the German army in the first few weeks of the war, German civil servants took control and were generally correct, albeit strict and severe. Belgium was heavily industrialized; while farms operated and small shops stayed open some large establishments shut down or drastically reduced their output. The faculty closed the universities; many publishers shut down their newspapers. Most Belgians \\"turned the four war years into a long and extremely dull vacation,\\" according to Kossmann.Kossmann, p 525 In 1916 Germany deported 120,000 men to work in Germany; this led to protests from neutral countries and they were returned. Germany then stripped some factories of useful machinery, and used the rest as scrap iron for its steel mills.Kossmann, p 533 At the start of war, silver 5 franc coins were collected and melted down by the National Bank to augment its silver reserves. They were exchangeable for paper banknotes, and later zinc coins, although many demonetized silver coins were hoarded. With the German invasion, the National Bank's reserves were transferred to Antwerp and eventually to England where they were deposited at the Bank of England. Throughout the German occupation there was a shortage of official coins and banknotes in circulation, and so around 600 communes, local governments and companies issued their own unofficial \\"Necessity Money\\" to enable the continued functioning of the local economies. The Belgian franc was fixed at an exchange rate of 1 franc to 1.25 German mark, which was also introduced as legal tender. Neutral countries led by the United States set up the Commission for Relief in Belgium, headed by American engineer Herbert Hoover. It shipped in large quantities of food and medical supplies, which it tried to reserve for civilians and keep out of the hands of the Germans.Johan den Hertog, \\"The Commission for Relief in Belgium and the Political Diplomatic History of the First World War,\\" Diplomacy and Statecraft, (Dec 2010) 21#4 pp 593-613, Many businesses collaborated with the Germans. The government set up judicial proceedings to punish the collaborators.Laurence van Ypersele and Xavier Rousseaux, \\"Leaving the War: Popular Violence and Judicial Repression of 'unpatriotic' behaviour in Belgium (1918–1921),\\" European Review of History (Spring 2005) 12#3 pp 3-22 =Belgian Congo= Rubber had long been the main export of the Belgian Congo and production levels held up during the war but its importance fell from 77% of exports (by value) to only 15%. New resources were opened, especially copper mining in Katanga Province. The Union Minière du Haut Katanga company dominated the copper industry, exporting its product along a direct rail line to the sea at Beira. The war caused a heavy demand for copper, and production soared from 997 tons in 1911 to 27,000 tons in 1917, then fell off to 19,000 tons in 1920. Smelters operate at Elisabethville. Before the war the copper was sold to Germany and, in order to prevent loss of capacity, the British purchased all the Congo's wartime output with the revenues going to the Belgian government in exile. Diamond and gold mining also expanded during the war. The Anglo-Dutch firm Lever Bros. greatly expanded the palm oil business during the war and there was an increased output of cocoa, rice and cotton. New rail and steamship lines opened to handle the expanded export traffic. France French photograph entitled \\"Heroic Women of France. Hitched to the plough, cultivating the soil. All agriculture rests upon their shoulders. Uncomplaining, with an attitude that amounts almost to religious exultation, the woman of France bears the burden.\\", c. 1917–20, extolling the female contribution to agriculture The German invasion captured 40% of France's heavy industry in 1914, especially in steel and coal. French GDP in 1918 was 24% smaller than in 1913; since a third went into the war effort, the civilian standard of living fell by half. But thousands of little factories opened up across France, hiring women, youth, elderly, disabled veterans, and behind the lines soldiers. Algerian and Vietnamese laborers were brought in. Plants produced 200,000 75mm shells a day. The US provided much food, steel, coal and machine tools, and $3.6 billion in loans to finance it all; the British loaned another $3 billion.* Philippe Bernard, and Henri Dubief. The Decline of the Third Republic, 1914–1938, (1985) pp 21–101 Considerable relief came with the influx of American food, money and raw materials in 1917. The economy was supported after 1917 by American government loans which were used to purchase foods and manufactured goods. The arrival of over a million American soldiers in 1918 brought heavy spending for food and construction materials. France's diverse regions suffered in different ways. While the occupied area in 1913 contained only 14% of France's industrial workers, it produced 58% of the steel, and 40% of the coal.Gerd Hardach, The First World War: 1914–1918 (1977) pp 87–88 War contracts made some firms prosperous but on the whole did not compensate for the loss of foreign markets. There was a permanent loss of population caused by battle deaths and emigration.Francis Koerner, \\"L'economie du Massif central durant la premiere guerre mondiale,\\" Revue Historique (1987) 277#1 pp 67–81 in JSTOR The economy of Algeria was severely disrupted. Internal lines of communication and transportation were disrupted, and shipments of the main export, cheap wine, had to be cut back. Crime soared as French forces were transferred to the Western Front, and there was rioting in the province of Batna. Shortages mounted, inflation soared, banks cut off credit, and the provincial government was ineffective.G. Meynier, \\"L'economie de l'est Algerien pendant la guerre de 1914–1918,\\" Revue Historique (1972) 247#1 pp 81–116. in JSTOR = Finance = The French government floated four war bond issues on the London market and raised 55 million pounds. These bonds were denominated in francs instead of pounds or gold, and were not guaranteed against exchange rate fluctuations. After the war the franc lost value and British bondholders tried, and failed, to get restitution.Arthur Turner, \\"British Holdings Of French War Bonds: An Aspect of Anglo-French Relations during the 1920s\\", Financial History Review (1996) 3#2 pp. 153–174 J.P. Morgan & Co. of New York was the major American financier for the Allies, and worked closely with French bankers. However its dealings became strained because of growing misunderstandings between the Wall Street bankers and French bankers and diplomats.Martin Horn, \\"A Private Bank at War: J.P. Morgan & Co. and France, 1914–1918\\", Business History Review (2000) 74#1 pp. 85–112 =French colonies= French colonies supplied workers for munitions factories and other jobs in France. A famous example was Ho Chi Minh who worked in Paris, and was highly active in organizing fellow Vietnamese, and even demanding a voice for them at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. The French army enlisted hundreds of thousands of colonials. From Africa came 212,000 soldiers, of whom 160,000 fought on the Western front.Richard Fogarty, Race and War in France: Colonial Subjects in the French Army, 1914–1918 (2008); Myron Echenberg, Colonial Conscripts: The Tirailleurs Sénégalais in French West Africa, 1857–1960 (1991). The rapid unplanned buildup of French military operations in Africa disrupted normal trade relations and all the colonies, especially disrupting food supplies for the cities and distorting the local labor markets. French administrators, focused on supporting the armies on the Western Front, disregarded or suppressed protest movements.Jeremy Rich, \\"Hunger and Consumer Protest in Colonial Africa during the First World War,\\" Food, Culture & Society 10.2 (2007): 239-259. Russia The Russian economy was far too backward to sustain a major war, and conditions deteriorated rapidly, despite financial aid from Britain. By late 1915 there was a severe shortage of artillery shells. The very large but poorly equipped Russian army fought tenaciously and desperately despite its poor organisation and lack of munitions. Casualties were enormous. By 1915, many soldiers were sent to the front unarmed, and told to pick up whatever weapons they could from the battlefield.Peter Gatrell, \\"Poor Russia, Poor Show: Mobilising a Backward Economy for War, 1913–1917\\" in Stephen Broadberry and Mark Harrison, eds., The Economics of World War I pp (2005) 235–275. The onset of World War I exposed the poor administrative skills of the czarist government under Nicholas II. A show of national unity had accompanied Russia's entrance into the war, with defense of the Slavic Serbs the main battle cry. In the summer of 1914, the Duma and the zemstva expressed full support for the government's war effort. The initial conscription was well organized and peaceful, and the early phase of Russia's military buildup showed that the empire had learned lessons from the Russo-Japanese War. But military reversals and the government's incompetence soon soured much of the population. Enemy control of the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea severed Russia from most of its foreign supplies and markets. Russia had not prepared for a major war and reacted very slowly as problems mounted in 1914–16. Inflation became a serious problem. Because of inadequate material support for military operations, the War Industry Committees were formed to ensure that necessary supplies reached the front. But army officers quarreled with civilian leaders, seized administrative control of front areas, and refused to cooperate with the committee. The central government distrusted the independent war support activities that were organized by zemstva and cities. The Duma quarreled with the war bureaucracy of the government, and center and center-left deputies eventually formed the Progressive Bloc to create a genuinely constitutional government. While the central government was hampered by court intrigue, the strain of the war began to cause popular unrest. Food shortages increasingly impacted urban areas, caused by military purchases, transportation bottlenecks, financial confusion, and administrative mismanagement.Mikhail D. Karpachev, \\"The Provisioning Crisis during the First World War,\\" Russian Studies in History 55#3-4 (2016): 209-233. By 1915 high food prices and fuel shortages caused strikes in some cities. Food riots became more common and more violent, and ready the angry populace for withering political attacks on the czarist regime.Barbara Alpern Engel, \\"Not by bread alone: subsistence riots in Russia during World War I.\\" Journal of Modern History 69.4 (1997): 696-721. online Workers, who had won the right to representation in sections of the War Industries Committee, used those sections to mobilize political opposition. The countryside also was becoming restive. Soldiers were increasingly insubordinate, particularly the newly recruited peasants who faced the prospect of being used as cannon fodder in the inept conduct of the war.Peter Gatrell, Russia's First World War: A Social and Economic History (2005) excerpt The bad situation continued to deteriorate. Increasing conflict between the tsar and the Duma destroyed popular and elite support for the old regime. In early 1917, deteriorating rail transport caused acute food and fuel shortages, which resulted in escalating riots and strikes. Authorities summoned troops to quell the disorders in Petrograd (as St. Petersburg had been called since September 1914, to Russianize the Germanic name). In 1905 troops had fired on demonstrators and saved the monarchy, but in 1917 the troops turned their guns over to the angry crowds. Public support for the tsarist regime simply evaporated in 1917, ending three centuries of Romanov rule.W. Bruce Lincoln, Passage through Armageddon: The Russians in War and Revolution 1914–1918 (1986). Italy Italy joined the Allies in 1915, but was poorly prepared for war. Loans from Britain paid for nearly all its war expenses. The Italian army of 875,000 men was poorly led and lacked heavy artillery and machine guns. The industrial base was too small to provide adequate amounts of modern equipment, and the old-fashioned rural base did not produce much of a food surplus.Francesco Galassi and Mark Harrison, \\"Italy at war, 1915–1918,\\" in Broadberry and Harrison, eds. The Economics of World War I (2005) ch. 9 Before the war the government had ignored labor issues, but now it had to intervene to mobilize war production. With the main working-class Socialist party reluctant to support the war effort, strikes were frequent and cooperation was minimal, especially in the Socialist strongholds of Piedmont and Lombardy. The government imposed high wage scales, as well as collective bargaining and insurance schemes.Luigi Tomassini, \\"Industrial Mobilization and the labour market in Italy during the First World War,\\" Social History, (Jan 1991), 16#1 pp 59–87 Many large firms expanded dramatically. The workforce at the Ansaldo munitions company grew from 6,000 to 110,000 as it manufactured 10,900 artillery pieces, 3,800 warplanes, 95 warships and 10 million artillery shells. At Fiat the workforce grew from 4,000 to 40,000. Inflation doubled the cost of living. Industrial wages kept pace but not wages for farm workers. Discontent was high in rural areas since so many men were taken for service, industrial jobs were unavailable, wages grew slowly and inflation was just as bad.Tucker, European Powers in the First World War, p 375-76  United States Economic confusion in 1917= Columbia to the stake. In terms of munitions production, the 15 months after April 1917 involved an amazing parade of mistakes, misguided enthusiasm, and confusion. Americans were willing enough, but they did not know their proper role. Wilson was unable to figure out what to do when, or even to decide who was in charge. Typical of the confusion was the coal shortage that hit in December 1917. Because coal was by far the most major source of energy and heat, a grave crisis ensued. There was in fact plenty of coal being mined, but 44,000 loaded freight and coal cars were tied up in horrendous traffic jams in the rail yards of the East Coast. Two hundred ships were waiting in New York harbor for cargo that was delayed by the mess. The solution included nationalizing the coal mines and the railroads for the duration, shutting down factories one day a week to save fuel, and enforcing a strict system of priorities. Only in March 1918 did Wilson finally take control of the crisisDavid Kennedy, Over Here 113-25 =Women= The war saw many women gaining access to and taking on jobs traditionally assigned to men. Many worked on the assembly lines of factories, producing trucks and munitions. The morale of the women remained high, as millions join the Red Cross as volunteers to help soldiers and their families. With rare exceptions, the women did not protest the draft.Lettie Gavin, American Women in World War I: They Also Served (2006) For the first time, department stores employed African American women as elevator operators and cafeteria waitresses. =Labor= Samuel Gompers, head of the AFL, and nearly all labor unions were strong supporters of the war effort. They minimized strikes as wages soared and full employment was reached. The AFL unions strongly encouraged their young men to enlist in the military, and fiercely opposed efforts to reduce recruiting and slow war production by the anti-war labor union called the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and also left-wing Socialists. President Wilson appointed Gompers to the powerful Council of National Defense, where he set up the War Committee on Labor. The AFL membership soared to 2.4 million in 1917. In 1919, the Union tried to make their gains permanent and called a series of major strikes in meat, steel and other industries. The strikes, all of which failed, forced unions back to their position around 1910.Philip Taft, The A.F.L. in the time of Gompers (1957)  Central Powers = Germany  German munitions factory, 1916 While Germany rapidly mobilized its soldiers, it had to improvise the mobilization of the civilian economy for the war effort. It was severely handicapped by the British blockade that cut off food supplies, machinery and raw materials. Walter Rathenau played the key role in convincing the War Ministry to set up the War Raw Materials Department (Kriegsrohstoffabteilung—\\"KRA\\"); he was in charge of it from August 1914 to March 1915 and established the basic policies and procedures. His senior staff were on loan from industry. KRA focused on raw materials threatened by the British blockade, as well as supplies from occupied Belgium and France. It set prices and regulated the distribution to vital war industries. It began the development of ersatz raw materials. KRA suffered many inefficiencies caused by the complexity and selfishness KRA encountered from commerce, industry, and the government.D. G. Williamson, \\"Walther Rathenau and the K.R.A. August 1914–March 1915\\", Zeitschrift für Unternehmensgeschichte (1978) Issue 11, pp 118–136.Hew Strachan, The First World War: Volume I: To Arms (2001) pp. 1014–49 on Rathenau and KRA Some two dozen additional agencies were created dealing with specific products; the agencies could confiscate supplies and redirect them to the munitions factories. Cartels were created and small firms merged into larger ones for greater efficiency and ease of central control.Gerald D. Feldman, \\"The Political and Social Foundations of Germany's Economic Mobilization, 1914–1916\\", Armed Forces & Society (1976) 3#1 pp. 121–145. Online. Even though there is a believe that the inequality among the German population only increased during the WW1, a number of studies have shown the opposite. It was proved that the income of the majority of the enterprises declined proportionally to the loss in the real wage. Moreover, the international corporate profits (e.g. in the UK) of that time were generally higher than those of Germany. The only companies that have undergone the rise in profits were related to the chemical, metal and machinery industries. Those were usually referred to as ‘war profiteers’. The military took an increasingly dominant role in setting economic priorities and in direct control of vital industries. It was usually inefficient, but it performed very well in aircraft. The army set prices and wages, gave out draft exemptions, guaranteed the supply of credit and raw materials, limited patent rights, and supervised management–labor relationships. The industry expanded very rapidly with high quality products and many innovations, and paid wages well above the norm for skilled workers.John H. Morrow Jr., \\"Industrial Mobilization in World War I: The Prussian Army and the Aircraft Industry\\", Journal of Economic History, (1977) 37#1 pp. 36–51 . Total spending by the national government reached 170 billion marks during the war, of which taxes covered only 8%, and the rest was borrowed from German banks and private citizens. Eight national war loans reached out to the entire population and raised 100 million marks. It proved almost impossible to borrow money from outside. The national debt rose from only 5 billion marks in 1914 to 156 billion in 1918. These bonds became worthless in 1923 because of hyperinflation.T. Balderston, \\"War finance and inflation in Britain and Germany, 1914–1918\\", Economic History Review (1989) 42#3 pp. 222–244Fred Rogers Fairchild, German War Finance (1922) As the war went on conditions deteriorated rapidly on the home front, with severe food shortages reported in all urban areas by 1915. Causes involved the transfer of many farmers and food workers into the military, an overburdened railroad system, shortages of coal, and the British blockade that cut off imports from abroad. The winter of 1916–1917 was known as the \\"turnip winter\\", because that vegetable, usually fed to livestock, was used by people as a substitute for potatoes and meat, which were increasingly scarce. Thousands of soup kitchens were opened to feed the hungry people, who grumbled that the farmers were keeping the food for themselves. Even the army had to cut the rations for soldiers. Morale of both civilians and soldiers continued to sink.Roger Chickering, Imperial Germany and the Great War, 1914–1918 (2004) pp. 141–42Ernest H. Starling, \\"The Food Supply of Germany During the War\\" (1922). Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, vol. 83 no. 2. pp. 225–254.  Ottoman Empire  In the Ottoman Empire Turkish nationalists took control before the war began. They drove out Greeks and Armenians who had been the backbone of the business community, replacing them with ethnic Turks who were given favorable contracts but who lacked the international connections, credit sources, and entrepreneurial skills needed for business. The Ottoman economy was based on subsistence agriculture; there was very little industry. Turkish wheat was in high demand, but transportation was rudimentary and not much of it reached Germany. The war cut off imports except from Germany. Prices quadrupled. The Germans provided loans and supplied the army with hardware, especially captured Belgian and Russian equipment. Other supplies were in short supply; the soldiers were often in rags. Medical services were very bad and illness and death rates were high. Most of the Ottoman soldiers deserted when they had the opportunity, so the force level shrank from a peak strength of 800,000 in 1916 to only 100,000 in 1918.Zurcher, Turkey: A Modern History (2004) pp 122–31 Austria- Hungary The Austro-Hungarian monarchical personal union of the two countries was a result of the Compromise of 1867. Kingdom of Hungary lost its former status after the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. However following the 1867 reforms, the Austrian and the Hungarian states became co-equal within the Empire. Austria-Hungary was geographically the second-largest country in Europe after the Russian Empire, at , and the third-most populous (after Russia and the German Empire). In comparison with Germany and Britain, the Austro-Hungarian economy lagged behind considerably, as sustained modernization had begun much later in Austria-Hungary. The Empire built up the fourth-largest machine building industry of the world, after the United States, Germany, and Britain.Schulze, Max-Stephan. Engineering and Economic Growth: The Development of Austria-Hungary's Machine-Building Industry in the Late Nineteenth Century, . Peter Lang (Frankfurt), 1996. Austria-Hungary was also the world's third largest manufacturer and exporter of electric home appliances, electric industrial appliances and facilities for power plants, after the United States and the German Empire. The Empire of Austria and the Kingdom of Hungary had always maintained separate parliaments: the Imperial Council (Austria) and the Diet of Hungary. Except for the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713, common laws never existed in the Empire of Austria and the Kingdom of Hungary. There was no common citizenship: one was either an Austrian citizen or a Hungarian citizen, never both. Austria and Hungary were fiscally sovereign and independent entities. The Kingdom of Hungary could preserve its separated and independent budget. However, by the end of the 19th century, economic differences gradually began to even out as economic growth in the eastern parts of the Empire consistently surpassed that in the western. The strong agriculture and food industry of the Kingdom of Hungary with the centre of Budapest became predominant within the empire and made up a large proportion of the export to the rest of Europe. Meanwhile, western areas, concentrated mainly around Prague and Vienna, excelled in various manufacturing industries. This division of labour between the east and west, besides the existing economic and monetary union, led to an even more rapid economic growth throughout Austria-Hungary by the early 20th century. Austria could preserve its dominance within the empire in the sectors of the first industrial revolution, but Hungary had a better position in the industries of the second industrial revolution, in these modern industrial sectors the Austrian competition could not become overwhelming.Iván T. Berend: \\"Case Studies on Modern European Economy: Entrepreneurship, Inventions, and Institutions\\", Routledge, 2013, page 151 The empire's heavy industry had mostly focused on machine building, especially for the electric power industry, locomotive industry and automotive industry, while in light industry the precision mechanics industry was the most dominant. During the war the national governments of Vienna and Budapest set up a highly centralized war economy, resulting in a bureaucratic dictatorship. It drafted skilled workers and engineers without realizing the damage it did to the economy.Tucker, The European Powers, (1999) pp 85–91Clifford F. Wargelin, \\"The Economic Collapse of Austro-Hungarian Dualism, 1914–1918,\\" East European Quarterly (2000) 34#3 pp 261–88, online The Czech region had a more advanced economy, but was reluctant to support the war effort. Czechs rejected any customs union with Germany, because it threatened their language and culture. Czech bankers had an eye to early independence; they purchased many securities from the Czech lands, thus insuring their strong domestic position in what became Czechoslovakia in 1918. Bulgaria Bulgaria, a poor rural nation of 4.5 million people, at first stayed neutral. In 1915 it joined the Central Powers.Tucker, The European powers in the First World War (1996). pp 149–52 It mobilized a very large army of 800,000 men, using equipment supplied by Germany. Bulgaria was ill-prepared for a long war; absence of so many soldiers sharply reduced agricultural output. Much of its best food was smuggled out to feed lucrative black markets elsewhere. By 1918 the soldiers were not only short of basic equipment like boots but they were being fed mostly corn bread with a little meat. The peace treaty in 1919 stripped Bulgaria of its conquests, reduced its army to 20,000 men, and demanded reparations of £100 million.Richard C. Hall, \\"Bulgaria in the First World War,\\" Historian, (Summer 2011) 73#2 pp 300–315 Neutral countries=Chile Chile's international trade collapsed and state income was reduced to half of its previous value after the start of the World War I in 1914.Villalobos, Sergio; Silva, Osvaldo; Silva, Fernando; Estelle, Patricio (1974). Historia De Chile (14th ed.). Editorial Universitaria. . p. 649.Salazar, Gabriel; Pinto, Julio (2002). Historia contemporánea de Chile III. La economía: mercados empresarios y trabajadores. LOM Ediciones. pp. 124–125, 141–142. The Haber process, first applied on an industrial scale in 1913 and later used as part of Germany's war effort due to its lack of access to Chilean saltpetre, ended Chile's monopoly on nitrate and led to an economic decline in Chile.Philip & Phyllis Morris, From Fertile Minds (review) American Scientist 2001 In addition to this the opening of Panama Canal in 1914 caused a severe drop in traffic along Chilean ports due to shifts in the maritime trade routes.Figueroa, Victor; Gayoso, Jorge; Oyarzun, Edgardo; Planas, Lenia. \\"Investigación aplicada sobre Geografía Urbana: Un caso práctico en la ciudad de Valdivia\\" . Gestion Turistica, UACh. Postwar Conditions on the Continent were bad for every belligerent. Britain sustained the lightest damage to its civilian economy, apart from its loss of men. The major damage was to its merchant marine and to its financial holdings. The United States and Canada prospered during the war. The reparations levied on Germany by the Treaty of Versailles were, in theory, supposed to restore the damage to the civilian economies, but little of the reparations money went for that. Most of Germany's reparations payments were funded by loans from American banks, and the recipients used them to pay off loans they had from the U.S. Treasury. Between 1919 and 1932, Germany paid out 19 billion goldmarks in reparations, and received 27 billion goldmarks in loans from New York bankers and others. These loans were eventually paid back by Germany after World War II.Ferguson, The Pity of War (1998) p 417Zara S.

It was broadcast weekday nights from 22:30 to 23:00 on Jade and HD Jade starting 10 June 2013 and was reviewed on Mytv.com for two months. This show focused on a group of middle-class men, described as “highly eligible bachelors\\" selected through social networking websites and a matchmaking company, trying to find spouses. They had to stand out during the evaluation conducted by the adjudicators, who were “Beauty Expert” Queenie Chan, Stylist Karl Hui and other experts. At the end, only eight men were “qualified” to be the bachelors. The eight contestants were Vincent, who had never dated any Hong Kong girls; Justin, an extroverted and confident Chinese Canadian; Thomas, with no dating experience; Cyrus, who swore not to be a die-heart suitor; Rocky, a muscular man with an unappealing face; Winter, with a well-paid job but perceived as a freak; Chris, who was working in disco but didn't like \\"play girl\\" and Guy, an intelligent PhD graduate. On the other hand, six ordinary but elegant ladies were selected. They were going to be introduced to the bachelors via videos. After receiving modification of appearance assisted by Karl, the bachelors encounter a broad range of challenges. They were evaluated by the judges and the female contestants and were eliminated from the show one by one until the best four bachelors selected. “The Best Four” were rewarded with travel to Indonesia along with the 6 females. Whether the females were impressed by the bachelors was supposedly all about the bachelors' sincerity and steadfastness. Content in each episode In episode 3, game on. The first task was ‘date in the dark’, where they set in pairs in the dark. At last, the 8 men failed to impress the ladies since they had showed their weaknesses in the dark. In episode 4, due to the unattractive men, 3 ladies quit the show (Carol, Mona and Evelyn). In order to regain the ladies’ interests, the 8 men underwent training to be the ‘Alpha Man’. For instance, training themselves to be more humorous. At last, Thomas won in this episode. Thomas was given a chance to have dinner with the team coach. In episode 5, after the trainings, the 8 men entered a ball with the ladies. Through the ball, they had to show the results of training to impress the ladies, to make their confessions successful. At last, Chris was revealed to be a double agent who spied on men’s attitudes from the very beginning, and he would leave the show with Winter, who failed in this challenge with no successful reply from his confessions. Episode 6 focused on the training of Rocky and Cyrus. Rocky underwent cosmetic treatment on his pimples in order to look more attractive. While Cyrus sought advice from experts so that he could avoid being ‘friend-zoned’. Episode 7 focused on Thomas, Justin and Guy. Thomas tried to boost his confidence in speaking with girls through speed dating. Justin was given a day to spend time with a typical ‘Kong girl’, while Guy sought consultation to change his attitude. In episode 8 and 9, the six pairs needed to go dating in a budget of $200 to find out if the men were creative and caring enough. Vincent took Alice to a nature park in mainland. Thomas and Jasmine went on painting. Rocky took Sharon to work for hawker stores to earn food. Guy simply took Whitey for a dinner while Justin and Vivien dined beside the river. Lastly Cyrus invited Sharon to film a video with him. In episode 10, after having a talent show and a cooking class with the ladies, 4 men remained. Thomas and Vincent couldn’t impress the ladies and they were eliminated. In episode 11-15, the remaining contestants embarked on a journey to Lombok in Indonesia and engaged in different tasks, to win opportunities to spend time with their targets. During the trip, Vivian and Sharon stood out from the girls due to their mean personality. As a result, none of the men wanted them. Moreover, Carol returned to the show and became a contestant in episode 11 again. After all the tasks and difficulties, the confessions of the 4 men wrapped up the show. Justin chose Carol but failed, Rocky and Guy chose Whitney. However Whitey chose Rocky. Surprisingly, Cyrus chose Queenie, one of the judges and instructors of the show. Reception=Critical Response The show received a generally negative response from critics. Most netizensNetizens Disappointed with “Bachelors at War” Premiere Episode and newspapers described the behaviour of the contestants in the show as \\"disgusting and disquieting\\" and the attitude of judges as \\"unprofessional\\".《求愛》導師搶盛男鏡 綠魔唔男唔女狂接投訴 Moreover, the Communications Authority (CA) received 32 complaints about the show, 電視撈飯：綠魔累盛男狂收投訴 mainly regarding Karl Hui, who was the stylist of the show. There were two more complaints about issues of sexual harassment. Controversy=Appearance of the Stylist The appearance of Karl Hui was a major focus among the controversies. In the first episode, he was in a green dress with a chignon. His high pitched voice and feminine gestures also attracted media comment. The CA and TVB both received complaints about Hui, regarding these aspects of his appearance. The heated debate about his sexuality and the calling off of the show were widely discussed on online forums, such as Hong Kong Discuss, Golden Forum and Facebook. Sexual harassment Another judge and an 'expert' on relationships, Chan Ting Pong, also created a controversy about sexual harassment. Chan taught male contestants to perform ice-breaking techniques with females, through touching the woman's body. Soon afterwards a man was the subject of a complaint after following Chan's advice, and was charged with sexual assault.求愛大作戰變求愛大非禮 This case stirred up concerns in the public, including The Association Concerning Sexual Violence Against Women.婦團轟TVB誤導男性非禮 See also * Bride Wannabes * List of programmes broadcast by Television Broadcasts Limited References Category:TVB original programming Category:2013 Hong Kong television series debuts Category:2013 Hong Kong television series endings ","title":"Bachelors At War"},{"id":"41003494","text":"This is a list of past and present Sarawak FA players who have been capped by their country whilst at the club.

He graduated from Northwestern University in 1912 and became Edward Filene's personal assistant, where he wrote two books on the side. He joined The Century Magazine as an associate editor and became its editor-in-chief in three years, which gave his views on education a wide audience. He was tapped to the University of Wisconsin's presidency in 1925, where he introduced the Experimental College before being ousted in 1937. Frank became involved in Wisconsin politics and ran for the state's United States Senate seat, but died with his son in a car accident two days before the Republican Party primary.  Early life and career  Glenn Frank was born on October 1, 1887 in Queen City, Missouri. He joined the Methodist Church when he was 10, and became an evangelical when 12. Passionate for oratory and religion, Frank became a circuit rider and traveled with Billy Sunday for one summer in Iowa as a teenager. He talked his way into classes at Northwestern University in 1909 despite a lack of formal education, though he previously attended Kirksville State Teachers College in Kirksville, Missouri. In college, Frank joined the yearbook and literary magazine (later becoming the latter's editor), acted and debated, and won two oratory contests. He gave speeches in the Evanston area to fund his education, and toured as a Chautauqua teacher in the summers. Walter Dill Scott called him the most brilliant undergraduate mind he had met. Frank earned his bachelor's at Northwestern in 1912 and won senior superlatives for contribution to school community and good looks. Northwestern President Abram W. Harris offered Frank a new alumni secretary position, which he accepted. He continued to give speeches while on the road for the next three years recruiting at high schools, organizing alumni, and building an endowment. He earned enough money to build a house for his parents in Missouri. He later became Edward Filene's personal assistant. During these years, Frank wrote The Stakes of War (1916) and The Politics of Industry (1917) on the side. He became an associate editor at The Century Magazine in 1918 and became its editor-in-chief in 1921. He wrote a monthly column on social issues that brought national renown to his thoughts on education reform. In 1925, he became the president of the University of Wisconsin–Madison.  Madison  Frank at his desk, c. 1925 Zona Gale, a Regent, was familiar with Frank through her fiction published in Century and asked him in April 1925 about filling the University of Wisconsin–Madison's presidency. Although opposed by the La Follette family, his nomination moved swiftly and on May 20, 1925 he accepted the position to begin in September. He was the youngest president of the university at the time, and unique for not holding an advanced degree. Frank started the brief Experimental College and expanded the agriculture program. He did not enjoy faculty support despite his support of academic freedom and tenure, and his public criticism of Franklin D. Roosevelt put him at odds with the La Follettes in public office. The Board of Regents, mostly appointed by La Follette, requested Frank's resignation in March 1936. Frank declined to resign and the Board held public hearings on his presidential competency before narrowly voting to remove him from office on January 7, 1937. Upon leaving UW–Madison, Frank joined Wisconsin political causes and began a bid for the Republican nomination for Robert M. La Follette, Jr.'s United States Senate seat. Frank and his son died in a car accident on September 15, 1940 outside Greenleaf, Wisconsin two days before his Senate primary.  Legacy  Arthur Hove's The University of Wisconsin: A Pictorial History noted of Frank's presidency: the Experimental College's influence despite its short life, the quality of his dean appointments, the staff's productivity, the Farm Short Course's revitalization, and his vindication of free speech.

His work was significant for pursuing an international scope and vision within a local context previously dominated by regionalist and national concerns. Over the course of his career he consistently sought to push his work towards new possibilities for painting, in the process moving between abstraction and representation, and using controversial themes and approaches, while maintaining a highly personal and recognisable style. His work spans a wide range of concerns including the New Zealand landscape (especially West Auckland), popular imagery (particularly the representation of the female figure), appropriation and art historical references. Scott's paintings are distinctive for their intensity of colour and light. His approach to painting is aligned with the modernist tradition, responding to the formal standards set by the American painters Morris Louis, Kenneth Noland and Jules Olitski.  Biography = Early life  Ian Scott was born in Bradford, England on 20 April 1945, the oldest of five sons. His family initially lived in the village of Baildon on the Yorkshire Moors near Bradford. In 1952, when Scott was seven, his parents, Barbara (Cox) and John Scott, moved the family to Auckland, New Zealand, seeking a life that offered more opportunity than the severe world of post-World War Two England.  Education  Scott's early interest in art, before moving to New Zealand, was fostered by his maternal grandfather, Ernest Cox, an amateur watercolourist. Scott would make sketches as he accompanied his grandfather on painting trips around the moors. In Auckland, he painted landscapes in both oils and watercolour of Sunnyvale, the Waitākere Ranges and the West Coast and, when he attended Kelston Boys' High School, took art classes with the prominent New Zealand painter Garth Tapper and Rex Head, a regular entrant in the Kelliher Art Award for landscape painting. In 1963 Scott attended evening classes run by Colin McCahon at the Auckland Art Gallery. In 1964 he began studies at the University of Auckland's Elam School of Fine Arts, and in 1965 his tutors there included Tapper and McCahon. Scott up a friendship with fellow student Richard Killeen, and during his time at art school also met Michael Dunn, who became an important historian of New Zealand art, and Petar Vuletic, a controversial critic and later art dealer. Scott completed his Diploma in Fine Arts with Honours in 1967, and was awarded the Fowlds Memorial Prize. The following year he began training as a Secondary School teacher at the Auckland Teachers' Training College.  Family  Scott met Nan Corson in 1978. They briefly lived in the Auckland suburb of Epsom before purchasing a house in Mt Eden. Their son, Chris Corson-Scott, was born in 1985, and is an artist working in the medium of photography in Auckland, New Zealand.  Main periods and series of work = Early Work  Scott established an early reputation as a landscape painter, winning the junior section of the Kelliher Art Award in 1965 with Low Tide, Anawhata (Kelliher Art Trust) and a Merit Prize in 1966. During this period, while studying at Elam, he also painted abstract works and developed a representational style which he referred to as \\"New Realism\\". The latter were informed by developments in American painting of the early 1960s, such as the Pop Art of James Rosenquist, and include paintings of suburban weatherboard houses (characteristic of 1960s West Auckland), often placed incongruously in landscape settings such as Milford Sound or Auckland's West Coast. Some of these paintings are made up of two panels and divided into several separate images. Lockheed L-188 Electra aircraft are sometimes visible in the sky, and in several paintings, including Air Disaster Over Mt Sefton (1967, Wallace Arts Trust), two or more aircraft crash spectacularly and comically. In these early paintings we see the beginnings of the kind of disjunctive imagery, or collisions of different traditions and realities, that became a conspicuous feature of Scott's work.  \\"New Realist\\"/\\"Girlie\\" series, 1967–70  Ian Scott. Leapaway Girl, 1969. Oil on canvas, 1725 x 1515 mm. The Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. Purchased 1971 from Wellington City Council Picture Purchase Fund Ian Scott. Track, 1968. Oil on canvas, 1730 x 1730 mm. Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tāmaki, purchased 2004 In 1967 Scott's stylised landscapes began to feature women clad in bikinis or fashionable garments of the era such as mini skirts – images that were often appropriated from popular culture, including magazines (such as Vogue and Playboy) and newspapers. They feature landscapes that capture the distinctive emblems of West Auckland, such as native forest and Kauri trees and West Coast beaches. The style of painting, with meticulously and smoothly rendered transitions and details, knowingly takes up the \\"hard-edged\\" tradition in New Zealand painting associated with Rita Angus, McCahon and Don Binney. Scott's paintings of the 1967–70 period have been labelled the \\"Girlie\\" series on account of their frolicking, scantily clad female protagonists. Important examples of works that fit this description include Land of Dreams (1968–69, private collection), Rainbow Girl (1969, Waikato Museum of Art and History Te Whare Taonga o Waikato), Homage to Morris Louis (1969, Real Art Roadshow), Jumpover Girl (1969, Victoria University of Wellington), Leapaway Girl (1969, Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa) and Sky Dash (1969–70, Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tāmaki), Agronomist (1970) and Teller (1970). Leapaway Girl is probably the most well- known of these works, which former curator at Te Papa William McAloon has described as being \\"produced at a time when the histories of New Zealand painting were being written and the identification of an authentic local tradition – one rooted in the landscape, the harsh New Zealand light and its clearly delineated forms – was paramount.\\" However, McAloon also acknowledges the international influences Scott was fusing with New Zealand art, writing: \\"Not that all the references are local: elsewhere in the series Scott drew on images of contemporary American abstraction, and even here the bold colours of the leaping frock suggest a color field painting gone airborne. More obvious touchstones for the series are American pop artists Mel Ramos, in his paintings of pin-ups, and Tom Wesselmann in his Great American Nude series.\\" Leapaway Girl was one of 166 paintings included by the Museum of New Zealand in their 2012 launch of their online collection. However, there are a large number of paintings in the series, including major examples, that do not fit the popular perception of the \\"Girlie\\" series. These include portraits of notable figures in the artist's life, such as his brother (Nigel at Anawhata, 1968–69), fellow artists (Colin McCahon in North Otago, 1967–68, Hocken Library, University of Otago; Don Binney at Te Henga, 1969–70, Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tāmaki) and his Wellington dealer (Peter McLeavey, 1969–70, Collection of Peter McLeavey). Others have images of couples and children, both idealised and absurd (Offspring, 1969, Table Baby, 1970, and Golden Dreams, 1969, Te Manawa, Palmerston North). Track (1968, Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tāmaki) is based on a photograph of the publisher – and protector of endangered Kauri forests – A.H. Reed with his daughter and grandchildren; Scott has them posing stolidly in front of an Auckland Regional Council sign and a stand of Kauri trees. The radical and iconic nature of this painting prompted the poet and art-writer David Eggleton to exclaim that it \\"charges out of the late 1960s like a rogue elephant,\\" a phrase that nicely captures Scott's propensity for brazenly disrupting the norms and conventions of New Zealand art.  The Nelson Years, 1971–73  Scott's teacher-training obligated him to take up a teaching position upon completion of the programme. He moved to Nelson and taught art at Nelson College. Over the next couple of years he painted the Tasman Bay series – ostensibly abstract paintings, though with a landscape feeling, which have thick fields of muted colour, greens and yellows predominantly, and reflect Scott's interest in the \\"thick field\\" paintings of the American Larry Poons. Also from the Nelson period is a series of paintings with flat, cartoonish figurative elements as well as abstract shapes and textures (such as an effect resembling the stucco cladding of his rented flat). The overall significance of the paintings of this period lies in the way the artist translates the feelings and imagery of his immediate environment into an abstract idiom directly comparable with developments in American modernism, particularly the paintings of Poons and Olitski. In 1971 Scott visited Auckland to see an exhibition of paintings by Morris Louis at the Auckland Art Gallery. The exhibition left a lasting impression, and Scott was particularly impressed by the almost 24-foot long Unfurled painting, Beta Nu (1960, National Gallery of Auatralia, Canberra).  The Roller-stroke and Sprayed Stripe Paintings, 1971–73  Ian Scott. Quiver, 1974. Acrylic and enamel on canvas, 2360 x 1440 mm. Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tāmaki, purchased 1975 In 1973 Scott returned to Auckland, and produced a series of large abstract paintings using paint rollers and commercial house paint. The paint is rolled on freely and casually in wide swathes or chunky arcs and blocks. These works evolved into the Sprayed Stripes, which spanned the years 1973–75. The \\"classic\\" examples from this series are composed of brightly coloured parallel bands, applied with spray cans, contained by a pale coloured rectangle that floats at an angle just off the vertical axis of a tall, rectangular, white-painted canvas. The most famous example of this series is probably Quiver (1974, Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tāmaki). These paintings were described by critic and art historian Edward Hanfling in 2005 as \\"the most significant paintings produced in this country [New Zealand], outside of Scott's recent white Model Series paintings.\\" The particular colour range of the Sprayed Stripes captures both the intense light of Auckland and the pastel hues typically used by suburban home-owners to paint their weatherboard houses. In using spray cans, Scott was also trying to evoke the sensibility of the home handyman, the DIY culture of suburban New Zealand. However, Scott's feelings for this local environment were by no means expressed in an illustrative or representational idiom. Rather, they were condensed and emblematised, absorbed into a formal language that drew inspiration from American modernism, particularly the paintings of Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland.  The Lattices  Ian Scott. Lattice No.58, 1979. Acrylic on canvas, 1727 x 1730 mm. Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, purchased 1980 In 1975 Scott produced a large number of works on paper that contain the basic ingredients of what became the Lattice series, an immense body of acrylic abstract paintings that he worked on intensively during the second half of the 1970s, and which he returned to repeatedly throughout the rest of his life. The Lattice paintings are typically based on a flexible, constantly varied system of usually diagonal, interlaced bands of colour, within a square canvas. \\"The basic over and under pattern which holds the forms meshed together on the picture surface is common to all the paintings of the Lattices.\\" Early examples from 1976 to 1977, such as Lattice No. 11 (May 1977, Christchurch Art Gallery), have white horizontal and vertical as well as diagonal bands, their edges marked by black crayon rubbed along the edges of masking tape, with brightly coloured bands seeming to form a grid behind the white bands. From 1978 onwards, the crayon lines were eliminated in favour of clean, masked edges of abutted colour, and with the exception of the Asymmetrical Lattices the square canvas became the standard support. A key example of this highly resolved system is Lattice No. 45 (1978, Dunedin Public Art Gallery), with which Scott won the 1978 Benson & Hedges Art Award. Scott invented a considerable range of compositions within the overall Lattice series, varying the width, layout and organisation of the bands as well as the range and intensity of the colours. A number of works, such as Lattice No. 58 (July 1979, Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa), have black bands alternating with high-keyed colours, whereby, as art historian Elva Bett observed, \\"a vast three-dimensional depth is created as the bands of strident colour whip and pull beyond the canvas.\\" Others are pared back to white against raw canvas, or black and raw canvas. An example of the latter is Lattice No. 91 (1982, Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa).  Model series, 1996–2007  The Model series brings together elements of Scott's figurative work and his ongoing commitment to the modernist ambition of inventing new pictorial structures (the way in which the visual elements of a painting are arranged on the canvas surface). Just as in many of the earlier \\"New Realist\\" paintings, Scott was both exploring and challenging the tradition of the nude with reference to contemporary popular culture. The paintings feature women from soft-porn magazines standing in front of paintings, usually representations of modernist abstract or Pop works that appear to be hanging on the exterior walls of suburban houses or on the white walls of an art gallery. The style of the paintings, particularly those before 2004, is notable for the physicality of the brushwork, with the artist seeking to avoid an overly clean and detailed effect in favour of emphasising the materiality and construction of the image. A significant development in the series came with the lateral extension of the picture format, the figure positioned to one side of an abstract expanse of white canvas. Model Series No. 80: The End of Louis (April 2006) alludes to Morris Louis's painting, Beta Nu (1960, National Gallery of Australia, Canberra), one of the sources of inspiration for this new \\"open\\" pictorial structure.  Controversies = \\"Girlie\\" paintings  Scott's \\"Girlie\\" paintings, though critically acclaimed, were also controversial when they were first exhibited in the late 1960s due to the display of nudity that was then considered too explicit in New Zealand's relatively conservative society. The painting Lawn Lovers (1969), which was a finalist in the 1969 Manawatu Art Prize, was banned from exhibition in the regional centres of Palmerston North and Hamilton after a public outcry in which the gallery received letters of complaint. The Hawkes Bay newspaper, The Daily Telegraph, ran an article that recorded reactions of outrage to the painting. In a strange and unfortunate twist, the painting was later loaned to a friend of the artist, and changed hands several times leading to its eventual destruction. When Scott entered two more \\"Girlie\\" paintings in the 1970 Manawatu Art Prize, Sky Leap (1970) and Table Baby (1970), Waikato Times critic, G.E. Fairburn, described them as \\"repellent\\", adding that they \\"need to be seen to be believed.\\"  Model series  In 2007 an exhibition of Scott's Model series paintings at the Centre of Contemporary Art (CoCA) in Christchurch came under fire from members of the public, community organisations and critics, and generated intense online debate. Director of CoCA at the time, Warren Feeney, subsequently wrote: \\"Has any series of paintings ever been more loathed?\\"  Key exhibitions  * Minimal Lattices: 1978-1988, Hamish Mckay Gallery, Wellington, 2019http://hamishmckay.co.nz/exhibitions/Ian_Scott_- _Minimal_Lattices_1978-1988/1 * Realist paintings from the late 1960s, Michael Lett, Auckland, 2019http://michaellett.com/exhibition/ian-scott-2/ * Kaleidoscope: Abstract Aotearoa, Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, Wellington, 2018-2020https://www.tepapa.govt.nz/visit/exhibitions/toi- art/kaleidoscope-abstract-aotearoa * Sprayed Stripes and New Lattices, Michael Lett, Auckland, 2017http://michaellett.com/exhibition/ian-scott/ * Local Revolutionaries: Art & Change 1965 – 1986, Auckland Art Gallery, 2010–11 * Toi Te Papa: Art of the Nation, Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, Wellington, 2004–12 * Telecom Prospect, City Gallery Wellington, 2004 * Everyday Minimal, New Gallery, Auckland Art Gallery, 2004 * Vuletic and His Circle, Gus Fisher Gallery, Auckland, 2003 * Representation and Reaction: Modernism and the New Zealand landscape Tradition, Sarjeant Gallery, Whanganui, 2002 * New Visions: Beginning the Contemporary in New Zealand Art, Auckland Art Gallery, 2001 * Primary Structures, Robert McDougall Contemporary Art Annex, Wellington, 1997 * The Grid, Auckland Art Gallery, 1983 * Print Sampler, Auckland Art Gallery, 1981 * Auckland Artists, Auckland Art Gallery, 1978 * New Zealand Young Contemporaries, Auckland Art Gallery, 1977 * New Zealand Drawing, Auckland Art Gallery, 1977 * Abstract Attitudes, Auckland Art Gallery, 1976 * Richard Killeen & Ian Scott, Barry Lett Galleries, Auckland, 1969 * Manawatu Art Prize, Manawatu Art Gallery, Palmerston North, 1969 * Benson & Hedges Art Award, Barry Lett Galleries, Auckland, 1968 Legacy Scott died in Auckland in 2013 and was buried at Waikumete Cemetery.

Timothy Leonard Tyler (born 1968) is an American who was sentenced to life in prison for possession and distribution of LSD (or \\"acid\\") under the federal three-strikes law.. In August 2016, after serving 24 years and 27 days behind bars, Tyler was granted clemency by President Barack Obama. He was released on August 30, 2018. Background Tyler was raised in Connecticut and Florida, where he attended Lakewood Senior High School, graduating in 1986. His parents were divorced and he was physically and emotionally abused by his stepfather. He suffered from depression as a child and had episodes that resulted in at least six emergency mental health hospitalizations. After graduation, he toured the country attending Grateful Dead concerts, where he sold fried dough, fruit smoothies, beer, and soda. He also consumed and sold marijuana and LSD. He was first arrested in Panama City, Florida for LSD possession and released on his own recognizance. A second arrest occurred that resulted in three years of probation. Tyler resumed touring with the Grateful Dead and sent LSD to a friend who was arrested for marijuana possession who turned into a confidential informant for the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). During a two-month period, this informant, working with the DEA, asked Tyler to mail him LSD five times, which Tyler did. Tyler sent the package to his father's address, implicating him in the crime. Sentencing According to a pre- sentencing memorandum, Tyler was charged with selling 1,300 hits of acid, found on 13 sheets of paper and equivalent to several grams of liquid. According to the memo prepared by his probation officer, he netted about $3,000 from \\"a very loosely woven conspiracy\\" that involved selling acid to \\"friends, family and business acquaintances\\". Tyler pleaded guilty to drug distribution. In 1992, at age 24, he was sentenced to life in prison without parole because of his two prior drug convictions (for which he did not serve prison time) under the federal three-strikes law. Under the law's stipulations, the judge was not able to consider Tyler’s drug addiction, lack of violent conduct, mental health issues, or youth when determining his sentence. Because the packages of LSD were sent to Tyler's father, he was convicted of conspiracy. He received a 10-year sentence and died in prison. His friend who worked as a confidential informant served 10 years. Life in prison After his conviction, Tyler was incarcerated in United States Penitentiary, Canaan in Pennsylvania. As of 2016, he was held in Federal Correctional Institution, Jesup, a medium-security federal prison. Because of prison prohibitions against music, Tyler went 20 years from the time of his initial arrest without listening to any Grateful Dead music, except what his sister could play for him in the limited phone time he was allocated. In 2012, inmates were permitted to purchase digital music players. In 2013, Senator Rand Paul has highlighted Tyler's case, writing that he \\"should have been punished for selling drugs, but he shouldn’t have to spend the rest of his life in prison for it. Today, Timothy is 45 and will likely spend the rest of his life behind bars, not because a judge thought it was a proper punishment, but because an arbitrary federal law demanded it.\\" More than 400,000 people signed a petition on Change.org calling on President Barack Obama to grant Tyler clemency. In August 2016, he was granted clemency, and subsequently released on August 30, 2018.

Hervey was born in Glasgow, Scotland, when eighteen years of age he emigrated to Sydney, New South Wales, and ultimately was largely engaged in pastoral pursuits in the Port Phillip District, which in 1851 was constituted the separate colony of Victoria. He played two first-class cricket matches for Victoria in 1851 and 1852. Hervey was elected to the part-nominated Victorian Legislative Council on 3 June 1853 for the Murray district and sworn-in August 1853. When responsible government was achieved he was returned to the first wholly elective Legislative Council for the Eastern Province in November 1856. From March 1861 to November 1862 he was acting president of the latter body during the absence in England of Sir James Frederick Palmer. When the James McCulloch Ministry was formed in June 1863 Hervey accepted a portfolio as Vice-President of the Board of Land and Works and Commissioner of Public Works. Hervey resigned both his office and his seat in Parliament in July 1865, owing to having met with pecuniary reverses. Misfortune still continued to pursue him, and he died in Turnbull Plains, Benalla district, Victoria, under very sudden and distressing circumstances on 1 December 1874, when a coroner's jury returned a verdict that death had resulted from insufficient nourishment.

Life Ayşe’s real name and origin are unknown, she most likely appeared at the harem by the end of 1628 and soon became the sultan’s only favorite. Privy Purse registers the presence of Ayşe as Murad's only Haseki until the very end of Murad's seventeen-year reign, when a second Haseki appears. It is possible that Ayşe was Murad's only Haseki until the advent of the second. In 1633 Murad raised Ayşe's stipend to 2,000 aspers, where it remained throughout his reign. The increase was most likely linked to a general increase in stipends throughout the palace during Murad's reign, described by Koçi Bey, and was accompanied by a marked growth in the size of the harem. These changes were probably an aspect of Murad's dramatic assertion of personal control of government after nine years of his mother's regency. She started her career at a stipend of 2,000 aspers a day while Murad's second Haseki received 2,571 aspers a day. Seven months later, however, the stipend of Murad's second Haseki was reduced to 2,000 aspers. After Murad IV’s death, Ayşe, like his other concubines, was sent out of the Topkapı Palace. The last mentioning of her receiving the stipend was in 1679/1680 and it is very probable that she died around that time. In popular culture In the TV series Muhteşem Yüzyıl: Kösem, Ayşe is portrayed by Turkish actress Leyla Feray.

It is Maeda's thirteenth film, and the plot centers on a teenager named Morio who has the IQ of a 6-year-old and his childhood friend who tries to get him to fit into the society. This film is based on the manga with same name by Yamada Naito. The film was released in Japan on September 22, 2012.  Plot  The story involves of three boys. They were all friends since they were little. One day, something which changed their entire life had happened. One of the boys called Morio, a six-year-old boy, fell from the swing when they were playing. He remained unconscious for about 12 years in a hospital. Morio’s friends and family tried to escape from the tragedy and forget about this accident. The other two boys, Mikihiko and Tomonari, had grown up and nearly forgot about Morio. Finally, Morio woke up and regained consciousness suddenly. However, Morio’s intelligence quotient stayed at 6 years old. Mikihiko decided to help Morio to catch up with the society. Therefore, Mikihiko had to sacrifice a lot of things in order to spend time and look after Morio, for instance, he broke up with his girlfriend Kie, quitted university and his free time etc. Nevertheless, Mikihiko failed to let Morio became accustomed to the society because Morio still had a childish and naive heart. Morio came back to the hospital and Mikihiko continued to live his own life at the end. Eventually, Mikihiko realised that everyone, even the ones who are childish as Morio could not escape from the reality of growing up and has to face the world which was ugly as sin.  Manga  This movie is adapted from a Japanese manga with the same name, “The Boy Inside”, created by Yamada Naito, who writes in both Japan and France. The manga was first published in 1992 in Weekly Young Sunday (Shogakukan) and reissued in 1997 and was announced to be released in the form of movie in September 2012.Manga News YESASIA: Osama to Boku (in Chinese)  Theme  “After being hurt and getting lost, we become adults.”, wrote on the movie's promotional poster. The film talks about various difficulties each teenager faces when they are about to turn to an adult. It focuses on the emotional struggles of teenage life. It is believed that each teenager has a period of time which they experience the feeling of confusion and reluctance to be a grown up. They refuse to become an adult because they know being an adult is different. Like those young friends of Morio in the film, they refused to make friends with Mikihiko, since he’s an adult. They regard adults as devils and are not willing to let Morio go with Mikihiko when they are having party. This is a struggle occurs inside every teen/child's heart. They don't understand an adult's way of life which is always fully scheduled with work and social life, but not genuine fun and innocent games. They try their best to fight with the changes when they grow up. But it is hard because sometimes life would leave you no choice but to follow the mainstream. Even though you are not willing to, one day you will find yourself engaged in the adult's life, like Morio in the film. Though he only possess the mind of a 6-year-old, he eventually took off his “crown”, his party hat, indicating giving up of his childhood. Also, it is awkward for Mikihiko to try his best to make contact with Morio after he woke up. This implies that the grown-ups are often eager to search for the innocence once they had but the fact is they always fail to do so as they have lost in the huge wheel of adults’affairs.

His father was a former federal military who participated in the Siege of Montevideo, under the command of General Antonio F. Díaz and Colonel Joaquín Ramiro. His father made his military career in the Batallón de Voluntarios Rebajados of Buenos Aires, a military unit at the service of Rosas, formed with veterans of the War of Brazil and the Campaigns to the Desert of 1830s. It is possible the paternal ancestors of Isabelino Canaveris have served in the regiments of Savoy or Hibernia. He was the grandson of Manuel Canaveris, a lieutenant of the Regimiento N° 4 de Infantería and Regimiento de Patricios, who participated as a volunteer of the militias in the defense and reconquest of Buenos Aires during the English Invasions of 1806 and 1807. His maternal grandfather was Francisco Farías, a well-known oriental politician, related to the families of Guillermo Brown Blanco. In 1903, he was honored by a group of co-religionists in the Società Unione Operai Italiani, the main club of the Italian community in Buenos Aires. Isabelino Canaveris was married to Enriqueta Trillo, born in Entre Ríos, daughter of Dionisio Trillo and Carmen Aguiar, belonging to a distinguished family. He and his wife were the parents of María Esther, Isabelino Manuel, Julio, Enriqueta, Alfredo and Bernardo Sixto Canaveris. In Buenos Aires, Canaveris and his family lived for several years in a house located in the neighborhood of San Telmo. His property, a luxurious house located on calle Chile No. 767 had been leased by Isabelino Canaveris to the English Alejandro Witcomb. His son, Julio D. Canaveris did his elementary studies in the Colegio del Salvador, and obtained a doctorate in the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Buenos Aires in 1907. His thesis \\"Coqueluche\\" was sponsored by Patricio Fleming, a well-known Argentine pediatrician. His work is mentioned in the Index-catalogue of the Library of the Surgeon General's Office of the United States National Library of Medicine of 1959. Isabelino Canaveris was nephew of María Farías Zubillaga, the wife of José Brito del Pino, one of the founders of the White Party. He is also directly or indirectly linked to the families of Bernardo Berro, President of Uruguay between 1860 and 1864. His granddaughter Blanca Canaveris Panelo, was married to Saturnino Soriano Nazar, related to Reynolds family, and descendant of Richard Blake Newton.

Jovan Jackson, (2012) is a landmark decision by the Fourth Appellate District of California, which affirmed that persons that associate to collectively cultivate medical marijuana are entitled to a legal defense as provided by California Senate Bill 420 (known as the Medical Marijuana Program Act). The decision has defined medical marijuana law in the state of California.  Overview  The court ruled that medical marijuana patients do not have to actively participate in the cultivation of medical marijuana, and that financial support provided by collective members through medical marijuana purchases constitute sufficient involvement in a collective.People v. Jackson, (2012) Cal.App.4th 1371 Mr. Jackson has been represented by attorney Lance Rogers and prosecuted by Deputy District Attorney Chris Lindberg three times for substantially the same offenses. Mr. Jackson stood trial for a third time in October through November 2013 where he was convicted of three marijuana related charges. His conviction will be appealed.San Diego Union Tribune: Ex-Pot Dispensary Manager Convicted  2009 Trial  Mr. Jackson and other medical marijuana patients operated the medical marijuana collective known as Answerdam in 2008. At Mr. Jackson's first trial, the jury was instructed as to the defense for marijuana collectives and cooperatives provided by the Medical Marijuana Program Act (MMPA). The jury acquitted Mr. Jackson of five counts related to the possession and sale of marijuana, but convicted him on a related drug charge.Not Guilty Verdict Reached in Medical Marijuana Trial Following Mr. Jackson's first trial, the jury foreperson explained the difficulty in interpreting the MMPA defense: \\"[I]t was all contingent on the medical marijuana defense and the lack of definition within the state law as far as what constitutes a collective or a cooperative.... So, um, just for the lack of definition of that state law was really the key. [¶] ... [¶] Um, the prosecution gave his... kind of narrow definition during the, the closing arguments, but there was nothing in the law that really backed that up.\\" People v. Jackson, (2012) Cal.App.4th 1371  2010 Trial  Federal and state law enforcement agencies continued to investigate Mr. Jackson and Answerdam while the first charges were pending. After Mr. Jackson's acquittal, law enforcement raided Answerdam again, and charged Mr. Jackson in a new information with one count of the sale of marijuana and two counts of possession of marijuana for sale. At Mr. Jackson's second trial in 2010, the trial court denied Mr. Jackson the MMPA defense that had previously been provided to him during his 2008 trial for similar offenses. Due to his lack of the defense provided by state law, Mr. Jackson was found guilty of the charges.People v. Jackson, (2012) Cal.App.4th 1371  Second Trial Appeal  Mr. Jackson, assisted by his trial attorney Lance Rogers, and Joe Elford of Americans for Safe Access, appealed the second conviction, leading to the landmark decision in People v. Jovan Jackson, 210 Cal.App.4th 1371 (2012). The court affirmed a defendant's right to the legal defense provided by the MMPA. In addition, the court clarified the law in regards to the MMPA defense. The court stated the three elements of the MMPA are that the collective 1. Are qualified patients or primary caregivers; and, 2. Collectively associate to cultivate marijuana; and, 3. The collective must be a nonprofit enterprise. In addition, the court provided factors for a jury to consider as to whether the collective is a non-profit, specifically: The size of the collective's membership; the volume of purchases from the collective; the members participation in the operation and governance of the collective; the testimony of the operator[s] of the collective; its formal establishment as a nonprofit organization; the presence or absence of any financial records; the presence or absence of processes by which the collective is accountable to its members; the volume of business it conducts; any other evidence of profit or loss. Mr. Jackson's conviction from the second trial was reversed and remanded to the San Diego Superior Court.People v. Jackson, (2012) Cal.App.4th 1371  2013 Trial  Following the reversal of Mr. Jackson's convictions, the San Diego District Attorney's Office proceeded to file charges against Mr. Jackson a third time. In October through November 2013, Mr. Jackson, represented by his pro bono legal team, stood trial for a third time in regards to his involvement with Answerdam.Americans for Safe Access: Jovan Jackson Medical Marijuana Trial Following a six-day trial that focused on complex accounting principles, financial records, and novel legal issues as to profit and non- profit business practices, the jury deliberated for a day before convicting Mr. Jackson.Americans for Safe Access: Medical Marijuana Patient and Provider Jovan Jackson Found Guilty Headed for Immediate Appeal Mr. Jackson's legal team plans to file an appeal.Navy Veteran Convicted of Running Retail Marijuana Store  Social and Political Significance of Proceedings  Mr. Jackson's case has become the symbol of the prosecution of medical marijuana dispensaries and patients.The Daily Chronic: Third Trial Begins San Diego Medical Marijuana Dispensary Operator Organizations have argued that his continued subjection to prosecution has demonstrated that the San Diego District Attorney's Office is engaged in a crusade against the medical marijuana laws passed by the voters and legislators of the state of California.San Francisco Gate: San Diego vs. Medical Marijuana In addition, outside organizations, most notably Terrie Best from Americans for Safe Access, have provided courtroom assistance and support to Mr. Jackson by providing daily updates to the public regarding the court's proceedings.Daily Updates from Jovan Jackson Medical Marijuana Trial It is the San Diego District Attorney's Office position that the guilty verdicts demonstrate that the Medical Marijuana Laws cannot be used to make profit.Navy Veteran Convicted of Running Retail Marijuana Store References Category:2012 in United States case law Category:2012 in California Category:California state case law Category:Cannabis law in California Category:Law articles needing an infobox ","title":"People v.

Ngai () means shout, while jong () refers to the executive committee of a college, department or society under the university's students' union. Every university has different colleges, departments and societies, and each of them will have an executive committee (jong), charged with organising student activities and offering aid to students. When a team of people want to become an executive committee, they form a proposed cabinet ahead of the election day. If successfully elected, the proposed cabinet becomes the real committee for the coming school year. Ngai jong is generally conduced by all proposed cabinets of all societies during the promotion period (called pro P in casual parlance), in which the cabinets campaign ahead of the election.. When proposed cabinets ngai jong, all members stand together and shout slogans, their full address, polling dates or sing songs to promote themselves. They also wear eye-catching costumes in order to stand out from other cabinets. A rule is that students can use only their own voice and body parts – microphones, drums, or loudspeakers are not allowed.  Purpose  The purpose of ngai jong is to promote the proposed cabinet. When the whole cabinet stands together and shouts slogans, people will see and listen to what they are doing. Also, their costumes will catch the eyes of pedestrians, including their basic members, so members will know the existence of this proposed cabinet and know when and how to vote. When the whole cabinet shouts their slogans or full address, teammates will have a sense of belonging, as they are promoting the cabinet together, and teammates are wearing the same costume, which can unite the whole cabinet. When cabinets ngai jong, they will shout slogans that introduce the cabinet, as well as slogans that include polling dates and venue. Since ngai jong is a special cultural phenomenon of universities in Hong Kong, proposed cabinets will automatically do this as it is a part of the whole election.  Advantages =For cabinet members Through shouting slogans and standing together while wearing the same costume, the whole cabinet will have a sense of belonging. When the team is more united, they can work better together. Through shouting slogans and standing together publicly, the cabinet will have the chance to promote themselves and catch the attention of the people who walk by. This is the most direct form of promotion in the university since the shouting of slogans will cause noises and people can hear their slogans and get to know them. When a society has two or more proposed cabinets, they can use \\"Ngai Jong\\" as a way to compete, since all cabinets will be at the same area at the same time. By shouting their own slogans, designing eye-catching costumes and designing colorful posters, they can use these peaceful methods to attract the attention of basic members, and the cabinet that shouts more loudly will gain more attention. This peaceful method of competing can prevent body contact. To the members of proposed cabinets, \\"Ngai Jong\\" is unforgettable, since it is a tiring but meaningful thing to do during the promotion period. It requires creativity in designing the slogans and it brings physical challenges as cabinets need to stay overnight outdoors for weeks at the university entrance in order to get a good position that is eye catching. For observers When cabinets shout at the entrance, podium or canteen, the students who walk by will feel refreshed since the cabinets all wear colorful costumes and shout loudly. Also, the posters and mascot of the cabinet will add liveliness to the campus. \\"Ngai Jong\\" is a unique culture of the universities in Hong Kong and this is seldom found in other regions. Foreign and exchange students will have a more fruitful and entertaining university life in Hong Kong. Tourists are attracted by this activity, and people who visit the universities can experience and feel the spirit of competing cabinets. To non- members of the cabinet, \\"Ngai Jong\\" can enhance their sense of belonging to the university. This activity also gives them entertainment in school life since they participate as an audience. \\"Ngai Jong\\" also arouses their sense of democracy as they have voting rights in the polling day to support the cabinet they trust.  Disadvantages  The students having lessons in classrooms that are near the places of \\"Ngai Jong\\" may not be able to concentrate on their lesson because of the noise. Some people in the common resting areas of the university may be disturbed by the noise given out by \\"Ngai Jong\\", as the activity is held everywhere in the university. There are time slots for the activity, which are mainly in the morning, noontime and the afternoon, but people may still be affected by the noise. In many universities, complaints from the residents are received every year during the committee election periods. Because the activity “Ngai Jong” is held at public spaces like the university entrance, corridors or near canteens, the noise may cause disturb to passers- by and the general public near the university or those who are using the university facilities. More and more complaints are received, which affects the university’s image and reputation. Since students are only allowed to use their own voices and body parts during \\"Ngai Jong\\" without the help of microphones or other sound systems, students would have to shout loudly in order to catch attention. The long time of shouting affects their vocal cords, causing voice loss or headaches. Also, as students have to stay outdoors overnight to get a good place for \\"Ngai Jong\\", they may lack sleep.

He was born c. 1754 in London. He worked mainly in dot or stipple engraving, producing portraits, illustrations, and allegorical and biblical subjects after prominent artists of the day. Biography Smith studied stippling techniques under Francesco Bartolozzi, one of the most famous and sought after engravers of the 18th Century. During his career Smith engraved many fine plates after the designs of contemporary masters such as William Hogarth, William Beechey and George Romney. He also created portrait engravings of such noteworthy individuals as Marquis Cornwallis and George III. Benjamin Smith, one of the foremost engravers of London, was for some years largely employed by John Boydell, who commissioned him to engrave many of the most important plates for his Shakespeare Gallery and for his Poetical Works of John Milton set, which were published between 1794 and 1797. These were some of Smith's best works. Five were after George Romney, Thomas Banks and Mather Brown for the Shakespeare series. Others included Sigismunda, after William Hogarth; a portrait of Hogarth with his dog Trump; portraits of Lord Cornwallis after John Singleton Copley, George III after Sir William Beechey and Napoleon after Andrea Appiani; The Lord Mayor Newnham taking the Oaths after William Miller; and several allegorical and biblical subjects after John Francis Rigaud and Benjamin West. Among his smaller pieces, some self- published, were portraits of Lord Charlemont, and the actors William Barrymore, William Smith, and Anne and Charles Dibdin. Smith's pupils included William Holl the Elder, Henry Bryan Hall, Henry Hoppner Meyer, Albin R. Burt, Thomas Uwins and Robert Cabbell Roffe. Smith died in 1833 at 21 Judd Street, Somers Town.  His son  In the period 1801 to 1804, Benjamin Smith the Younger born in 1774, worked on Charles Smith's New English Atlas, specifically on the maps for Devon, Sussex and Berkshire. In 1810 whilst sailing to Portugal for business, Smith and partner engraver Joseph Bye were captured by a French privateer and imprisoned in France for 4 years until peace was declared in 1814. They returned to Edinburgh where they worked as journeyman engravers for book sellers and map engravers W.H. Lizars. In 1817 Smith and Bye were convicted at Dover of uttering forged Margate Bank notes and initially sentenced to death. Petitions for clemency included individual petitions from Smith's wife Mary and from William Bengo Collyer; 7 collective petitions (65 people); and 8 letters, including from Sir Robert Gardiner on behalf of Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg (uncle of Queen Victoria, later to be King Leopold I of Belgium); from ex-employer William Home Lizars and his son Daniel Lizars; from publisher John Murray; and from the mayor and justices of the peace for the town and port of Dover. Murray's letter stated that “Bye and Smith shewed great ingenuity in engraving maps but did not excel in engraving written characters” [necessary for forging banknotes]. Smith and Bye were hanged on November 27, 1817. Smith's wife, Mary, had four children and lived in the Battle Bridge (Kings Cross) and Somers Town areas of London.

The main building, One World Trade Center, is a 17-story office tower that is the fifth-largest office tower in Portland with . Completed in 1977, One World Trade Center is tall and is topped by a heliport. The complex is operated by the World Trade Center Properties and is the headquarters for Portland General Electric. There is also a 220-seat theater, known as the World Trade Center Auditorium. History Portland General Electric (PGE) began construction in 1975 on a three-building, $32 million complex to be known as the Willamette Center. Located between Front (now Naito Parkway) and Second avenues, and Taylor and Yamhill streets in Downtown Portland, the complex was scheduled to open in January 1977. Plans originally called for construction of an outdoor ice skating rink at the complex. The five-story building in the complex was completed in 1976. More of the $54 million complex was opened by March 1977. In addition to being the headquarters of PGE, other initial tenants included the local offices of International Paper and Fireman's Fund Insurance Company. PGE was forced to sell the building in 1978 to American Property Investors and then lease back the space. The Oregon Public Utility Commission determined PGE could not bill customers for the expense of building the complex. In 1985, PGE launched a study to determine if a World Trade Center should be established in Portland, but a location had not been determined. The Oregon Legislature passed a bill in 1987 to establish the Oregon Trade and Marketing Center, which was to be housed in the Willamette Center. The Willamette Center was renamed as the World Trade Center in 1988 when the Oregon Trade and Marketing Center moved into the building, and was also renovated. Following the attacks on New York's World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, Portland's World Trade Center was evacuated. A new roof was installed on the building in 2008, and the next year sustainable landscaping was installed around the complex. In June 2010, a fire in the basement caused the building to be evacuated. Another fire damaged a stairwell in November 2011 when someone used a Molotov cocktail. Details The three-building complex was designed by Zimmer Gunsul Frasca Partnership (now ZGF Architects LLP), with the buildings connected by a glass-enclosed, elevated walkway. The facade of the modernist-style buildings consists of gray-colored granite. Primarily office space, the complex also houses restaurants and retail space on the ground floor, and also includes a theater. There are also 400 underground parking spaces and 13 charging stations for electric vehicle. One World Trade Center is a 17-story, tower of a curtain wall design for the facade. The roof of One World Trade Center houses the World Trade Center Heliport. One Main Place is south of One World Trade Center, while the Mark O. Hatfield United States Courthouse is southwest of One World Trade Center. The shortest of the buildings in the complex is Two World Trade Center (or World Trade Center 2), which is tall and has four stories. The World Trade Center is located inside Two World Trade Center, along with meeting space and an outdoor plaza.

History  * Since the 13th century, missionaries of the mendicant orders, Franciscans and Dominicans, created several Latin Catholic communities in present Romania, for whom the Holy See decided to created bishoprics, south and east of the Carpathians (in Walachia and Moldavia), generally short-lived; the most durable was to be Bacău. The diocese was created in 1590 (or 1591) by Pope Sixtus V. It was first situated in Curtea de Argeş (in Walachia; which had been the see of on earlier Latin Diocese of Argeș, vacated over a century earlier). * Due to the Ottoman occupation of the region in the early 17th century, the see was moved in 1607 to Bacău in Moldavia, which region had earlier had at least three Latin bishoprics: Diocese of Milcovia, Diocese of Siret and Diocese of Baia). Initially the see of Bacău was a suffragan of the Hungarian Archdiocese of Kalocsa. * In 1611, its territory was extend vastly, comprising in Walachia three 3 parishes, a Franciscan monastery and a Dominican one, and in Moldavia 35 parishes (only 9 having a resident priest). Also in the 1610s, Bacău fell into the sway of the Catholic Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. From 1621, its new Metropolitan was the Archdiocese of Lviv (Lemberg in German, the language of many Catholic immigrants; now in Ukraine) and Polish Friars Minor were nominated to the see requiring the assent of the King of Poland, who could reside in Lviv provided they visited the bishopric annually, while delegating daily administration to an apostolic vicar (properly a vicar general), who resided at Iași. From 1621 it also had jurisdiction in the eastern part of Moldavia (which later became known as Bessarabia). Its cathedral (1627, now Biserica de vizitarea Maicii Domnului) was dedicated the Visitation of Mary. * In the 18th century, the episcopal residence was shifted to Iași (the capital of Moldavia) or to Śniatyn (now in Ukraine). In 1774 the diocese had 10 parochial churches and circa 8.000 baptized Catholics. Around 1800, the see was vacant for decades after the suppression of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, then a few bishops were appointed again. * It was suppressed in 1818, its territory being reassigned to establish the (pre-diocesan) Apostolic Vicariate of Moldavia (now Diocese of Iași), yet it was still mentioned in the Annuario Pontificio till 1840.

The company is equally known for its unconventional approach to hi-fi design, ignoring specifications and test bench power ratings as indicators of the quality of amplification. Naim's approach includes, but is not limited to, absence of tone controls, the use of the DIN connectors instead of the RCA connector used almost everywhere in the home audio equipment industry, and reliance on over-engineered external power supply units (PSU) to deliver current for musical transients. The company's two- channel amplifier, that made its début in 1975, is among Naim Audio's most long-lived and well-known products.  History  The company, established in 1973, is one of the best-known hi-fi manufacturers in the UK. Its first product was a power amplifier named ; this was soon followed by the pre- amplifier. Until 1985, Naim's activity was centred on audio amplifiers. The two-channel power amplifier that made its début in 1975 is among Naim Audio's most well-known analogue products. Its basic circuit layout would be the model for its power amplifier range for more than 25 years, until the introduction of the flagship in 2000.  Philosophy  All of the early models were designed by Naim founder Julian Vereker, who wanted equipment that he himself and friends could enjoy listing through. He experimented with constituents of the sound reproduction chain: source components, amplifiers and loudspeakers. Received wisdom was that amplifiers were \\"straight wires with gain\\" that had no effect on the sound, but Vereker insisted that the performance of amplifiers on the market ranged from bad to abysmal. Vereker took some 12 months to learn enough about electronics to design the first product initially for personal use, named the . Vereker defined that the amplifier's premise was \\"to drive the loudspeaker with a musical signal such that I could compare the sound with live music and get the same degree of enjoyment\\", and then determined that the amplifier must be able to drive loudspeakers' \\"widely varying impedance under musical conditions\\" without information loss.  Design principles = Audio circuitry  Vereker believed that loss of information, often due to overload protection, was a damaging type of distortion that amplifiers were vulnerable to. Vereker attempted to reduce information loss at the design stage, by unconventionally disregarding test- bench measurements of harmonic distortion performance and output into a static resistive load. Naim says that to achieve amplifiers with low harmonic distortion, low noise, wide power-bandwidth, and constant dynamic output impedance, they pay attention to balancing dynamic impedance, open-loop bandwidth, slew rate, and propagation delay; the amplifiers are not subject to slew-rate limitation between 5 Hz and 50 kHz. Vereker believed that a properly designed amplifier would not need tone controls, since these filters were often palliatives for poor design. He contended that tone controls represented a cost of manufacture yet were detrimental to sound quality. Therefore, starting with the , Naim amplifiers have never featured the tone controls that were popular elsewhere in the industry. Vereker considered Naim amplifiers belong to the \\"class B\\" category where bias current is minimised. He believed that \\"class A\\" design was wasteful and masked significant design issues. Electrically, the pre-amplifiers are bandwidth-limited, and while Naim is open to the possibility that users might match their pre-amps with another make of power amplifier, Naim warns against using other makes of pre-amplifiers with Naim power amplifiers, arguing that the former define the operating parameters of the latter and guarantee its stability. In practice, modern products' bandwidth has been much extended, but the pre- and power-amplifiers are of such a tight operational fit and sonic synergy that they are rarely used with other makes.  Power source  Naim has from the outset externalised pre- amplifiers' power source, unlike other manufacturers, citing the undesirability of having AC and transformers' powerful magnetic field near sensitive pre-amplifier circuitry - the \\"key point of separates\\". Its over- engineered power supplies, aimed at ensuring adequate 'headroom' (ample reserves of power) for transients, are equally well-known. Naim strongly believes that an ample source of power is of the greatest importance, and the availability of external PSUs to accompany its products also reflects the philosophy. The performance of most of its pre-amplifier range benefits from adding one of a number of power supplies, which provide permutations for upgrading.  Output protection  Vereker also believed that a well- designed amplifier must be stable at all times when driving real-life loads, which are different from those achieved in lab conditions because loudspeakers' impedances vary with frequency. The inherent compromise between the pursuits for stability and sound quality means that Naim's power amplifiers are designed to work optimally with its own moderately priced speaker cable, and its predecessor . Product manuals warn users against using \\"high-definition wire or any other special cable between amplifier and loudspeaker\\". Whilst other manufacturers habitually employ Zobel networks (or an output filter which enhances amplifiers' stability) to protect against use with speakers and or cables with very high-capacitance, Naim amplifiers routinely omit these filters because of their adverse effect on sound quality. The design decision was made to use a suitable length of speaker cable (a minimum of 3.5m, with 5m being optimal) to provide the effective inductance.  Isolation  There has been a trickle-down of research from flagship models, particularly since the launch of the 5-Series. Subtle mechanical and electronic changes introduced in lower-rung products — as a result of research at the flagship product level — have contributed to build and sound quality: control of internal heat dissipation, wiring, radio-frequency interference and mechanical vibration through more efficient materials, compliant mounting and decoupling. Naim have found that, with increasing amounts of digital circuitry in their boxes, the electronics are much more susceptible to microphony and other mechanical vibration. Inside the top-of-the-range pre-amplifier, the circuit boards are weighted down and have their own suspensions, and there are transit bolts to secure the suspended boards during transport. The rear- mounted mains switch and IEC socket are decoupled to mitigate microphonic effects. The NAIT XS, launched in late 2008, is the first Naim device to use a new bayonet PCB-mounting technique to \\"float\\" the circuitry. Also during the development of the , Naim discovered that transformers and the power supply electronics in close proximity to audio circuity also affects power amplifiers. Their top models - the and the - now externalise power supplies in separate cases. Back-lit Naim Audio logo  Styling  In terms of styling, the amplifiers up until 1989 are constructed of heavy aluminium extruded cases that act as heat sinks; these were painted black with a metallic silver brim – thus nicknamed \\"chrome bumper\\" range. The pre-amplifiers are housed in \\"half- size\\" while most of the power amplifier range was housed in full-size cases. In 1989, the range was given a new look using the same sturdy aluminium cases but with a new olive-coloured fascia panel which also had a back-lit logo. Another facelift for the range came in 2002. The 2013 range of Naim equipment has aluminium chassis and sleeves; the fascia is die-cast zinc.  Construction  Reviewers of early Naim amplifiers criticised the distinctly \\"cottagey\\" styling, yet recognised that the money was spent on \\"what lies within\\". A review of Naim's first pre-amplifier observed its home-made appearance, saying: \\"the quality of mechanical construction is good, its over- all design appears to be of a utilitarian nature with little concession to visual styling.\\" In 2009, veteran hi-fi critic Malcolm Stewart noted that the communicative sound and minimalist design have been enduring characteristics of the entire range of Naim amplifiers since the inception of the firm. For its power amplifiers and PSUs, Naim have used for many years toroidal transformers supplied by Holden & Fisher, custom-made to Naim's design and specification. They source toroids from Nuvotem Talema in Ireland since H&F; ceased trading in 1993. Of modular construction, the various elements of the amplification and power supply circuitry are in form of plug-in boards. The phono stage is made up of dedicated boards, of which there were three variants matched to gain characteristics and electrical loading from different phono cartridges. There is no assembly line. Naim assembly staff build each piece of equipment in individual workstations from basic components and sub-assemblies, wire the product mostly by hand and progressively test to ensure compliance. Each component leaves the factory only if it passes a listening test.Martens, Chris (15 June 2013). \\"Meet Your Maker: Hi-Fi+ Visits Naim Audio\\" Ian White observed that the typical Naim product is \\"meticulously laid out, clean, and well put together\\". = Connectors = Naim's choice of connectors is part of its objective of achieving the Naim sound. Pre-amplifiers employ the BNC connector for phono inputs, as providing better impedance matching and earthing compared with RCA connectors. The DIN connector is also used in preference to the RCA connector for other inputs, as the DIN connectors help to ensure the equipment is properly earthed without multiple pathways that create hum-inducing earth loops and increase noise. Vereker noted that the cheapest RCA socketry was used with earlier designs as there was no sonic benefit to using the costlier DIN plugs, and that higher quality sockets were progressively substituted as systems improved. While Naim's practice of using DIN connectors has gained them fans and detractors alike, DIN sockets continue to be Naim's choice for line-level inputs, although some RCA inputs may be included, depending on the model. On their power amplifiers, Naim use recessed loudspeaker sockets that accept only banana plugs. Use of forks or bare wire- connectors for speaker output was ruled out from the beginning, even though this is standard practice elsewhere. Reviewers complained about \\"nasty little [banana plug] sockets\\" used for the amplifiers. Naim's own NAC A5 speaker wire occasionally comes in for criticism for its physical stiffness, and also for imparting a \\"brittle, scratch\\" quality to the sound.  Sound aspects The Naim sound is frequently described as possessing pace, rhythm, and timing (often referred to by the acronym \\"PRaT\\"). Naim have always valued the ability of a piece of equipment to communicate emotion in music more than sound purity, and PRaT is a synonym of that ability. Julian Vereker saw that there was room within hi-fi circles for subjective preferences, but he held that it was \\"totally wrong\\" to put presentation (i.e. soundstage, detail, and depth and imagery) ahead of content. And while Naim does not set out to achieve imaging and soundstaging as design goals, reviewers have noted that some of the equipment is capable of delivering on these. Naim amplifiers are well known for their ability to \\"consistently produce a tremendous sense of power and dynamics that belies their conservative power ratings\\". However, and although each piece of equipment is given a thorough soak test and auditioned before it leaves the factory, the equipment never gives optimal performance straight out of the box, and has a tendency to harshness when cold. Once the electronics have had the chance to \\"burn in\\", its sound mellows and becomes more fluid and communicative. Reviewers will usually allow the test equipment to warm up for days, if not weeks, before delivering their final assessment of the product.

The company's first amplifier, the , is a two-channel power amplifier with an output of 60 watts per channel; the , which is a one-channel amplifier based on the same design as the rated at 135 watts. A custom-built very fast and heavy-duty TO3 transistor device was employed in the original Naim amplifiers. Inside a monoblock chrome The , based on the design and released in 1975, had remained \\"virtually unchanged 18 years later\\"; and was still going strong after 25 years. In early product manuals, recognising that good results required high current amplification, Linn recommended using the Isobarik PMS tri-amped with Naim amplifiers. Early on, three amplifiers, fed by a 3-way NAXO electronic crossover, would typically be used, one for each stereo pair of the doubled-up treble, midrange and bass driver units. The monaural can be used in a \\"6-pack\\" configuration (i.e. six amplifiers, three for each speaker). In the late 1990s, still under Vereker's guidance, Naim developed a new flagship power amplifier using computer simulation and the latest transistor technology. Search for a transistor with the desired sonic characteristics led Naim to Semelab, who had created a device working at a combination of higher current and lower operating voltage. To accommodate the operating parameters, Naim opted for a bridge-mode topology. The output devices chosen, rated at 350W–70amp, are used singly within the amplifiers well within safe operating parameters; the use of protection relays, detrimental to sound quality, is thereby avoided. However, having the power supply in the same case was found detrimental to the sound quality, so the PSU is located in a separate alloy enclosure, linked to the amplifier by sturdy cables with locking connectors. The , capable of delivering in excess of 200 watts per channel into 4 ohms, was launched in 2000. The , launched two years later, is very similar to the , but with a separate box PSU, according to authoritative hobbyist website Acoustica. Since the development work on the , all amplifiers from upwards use the very costly \\"NA007\\" (re-badged from Semelab) output transistor.Taylor, Ced (Jan 2009). \\"Naim Power Amps: mods and upgrades\\". acoustica.org.uk As at April 2013, Naim have a range of six power amplifiers at various price points between £650 and £18,000.

When the company upgraded the range in 2002, the , and pre-amplifiers were given new names beginning with \\"2\\", thus becoming the , and respectively; a flagship 5-Series \\"cost-no-object\\" amplifier launched also that year was given the designation . The pre- amplifiers are designed to accept signals from source components without overloading, and Naim claims total stability and a very wide open-loop bandwidth. The half-size pre-amplifiers were modular, consisting of a mother board for higher-level signals into which are plugged various daughter boards that deal with lower-level signals such as phono and tape. Phono boards are plug-in modules to provide for the gain and equalisation of the cartridge output to line level, and some of the earlier pre-amplifiers may be suffixed with \\"N\\", \\"S\\", or \\"K\\" depending on the phono boards carried. \\"S\\" and \\"K\\" are for low output moving coil cartridges (the latter being for cartridges requiring a higher impedance load), and the \\"N\\" for high output moving coil and moving magnet cartridges. Power for the pre-amplifiers is drawn either from the 24V regulated feed from the power amplifier, or from independent power supplies. While being optional at the lower end, external power supplies are obligatory with the flagship models, from the (1990) to the (2002). The 552 was designed to work with an external PSU with an 800VA toroidal transformer that Naim says has enough capacity to supply a 300–400 W power amplifier. As at April 2013, Naim have a range of six pre-amplifiers at various price points between £1,050 and £18,250.

Naim decided that there was more to hi-fi than power ratings, and thus declined to disclose official power rating figures when the Nait was released. With it, Naim demonstrated that power-supply design in a small amp was important factor to sonic performance. Between 1983 and 2007, Naim had only one integrated amplifier on offer, although it has seen several incarnations. Naim extended the range with the Supernait in 2007, and the XS a year later. Some of the incarnations provided an obvious upgrade path for their equipment by simply inserting an external power supply unit. As at April 2013, the NAIT range consists of the entry-level Nait 5si and the top-of-the- range Supernait2, with the XS2 slotting in the middle. They are priced at between £875 and £2,825.

This is done so that the sensitive pre-amps, running at extremely very low voltages and currents, are not adversely affected by the hum field induced by the power supply. Power units have multiple separate secondary windings dedicated to supplying the various sections of the preamp that they feed. However, the , and power amplifiers do not have provision to power pre-amplifiers, so a PSU is mandatory. Power supply units' given names are often acronyms or abbreviations. \\"NAPS\\" stands for Naim Audio Power Supply, and its successor was called \\"SNAPS\\", being short for Super Naim Audio Power Supply. \\"Hi-Cap\\" is an abbreviation for High Capacity Power Supply. Power supplies are connected to the preamps and amplifiers with a \\"SNAIC\\" – Super Naim Audio Interconnect Cable – terminated at both ends with DIN plugs. The Flat Cap, Hi-Cap and Super Cap are, in order of increasing sophistication and cost, external power supply units produced by Naim for powering their pre-amplifiers, and are supplied with Naim's own DIN- terminated SNAICs. Most pre-amplifier models and some NAIT models offer the possibility of performance upgrade by introducing one of these power supplies to drive the pre-amplifier section. In addition to powering pre-amplifiers (, SUPERNAIT, , , ), the Hi-Cap can be used for other Naim equipment such as phono and headphone amplifiers (StageLine, SuperLine, HeadLine), the NAT05 XS tuner, and electronic crossovers (, ).\\"Naim HiCap DR Power Supply\\". Audio-T The top-of-the-range Super Cap has thirteen independent 24V feeds for audio circuitry and one 12V supply for digital control circuitry, and can be used for any Naim pre-amplifier (except for the , which has its own dedicated PSU); the alone makes full use of its multiple power feeds.\\"Naim SuperCap DR Power Supply\\". Audio-T In 2012, Naim launched power supplies incorporating new \\"discrete Regulator\\" circuitry that had been under development for two years. The most radical change is the replacement of the long-standing LM317 [integrated circuit] regulator with discrete components. Claimed benefits are improved impulse signal recovery; signal-to-noise ratios are said to be better by an order of 15–30 dB. The manufacturer offers retrofitting service to equipment from the Hi-Cap upwards. As at April 2013, Naim have a range of four amplifier power supplies at various price points between £775 and £5,725.

The Tablelands railway line is a railway line in North Queensland, Australia. It was opened in a series of sections between 1887 and 1916. It commences at Cairns and at its maximum extent, reached Ravenshoe at the southern end of the Atherton Tableland. The rail system served by this line was unusual for Queensland in that the majority of lines that connected to it were built by private companies and later purchased by the Queensland Government. History Following the discovery of tin at Herberton in 1879, the ports of Cairns and Port Douglas were established, competing for the role of dominant settlement in the area. The summer tropical rainfall in the region made roads virtually impassable in the wet season, leading to calls for improved land transportation in the region. The region to the west of this section of the Queensland coast was relatively rugged, being mountainous rainforest. Three potential routes were investigated to reach Herberton, via Port Douglas, Cairns and Geraldton (now Innisfail). The shortest route was from Innisfail, but it was the steepest and through very rugged country. The Port Douglas route was the easiest but longest. Cairns had the best port, and the unstable geology of the Barron Gorge wasn’t known at the time. After extensive debate, the Queensland Government selected Cairns () as the starting point of the line, and the first section opened to Redlynch (), at the base of the range, from Cairns on 8 October 1887.Kerr 1990, p. 224 Climbing the Kuranda Range The next section climbed the Barron River Gorge reaching 317 m asl using 1 in 50 grades and 4 chain (~88m) radius curves (the tightest used on the system) involving 15 tunnels and several major bridges. The Redlynch section was built with 21 kg/m (42 lb/yd) rails, but in recognition of the high wear the sharp curves would cause, the Gorge section was laid with 30 kg/m (60 lb/yd) rails.Ellis, R.F. 'Rails to the Tableland' ARHS 1976 This section opened to Myola () in 1891, and the line reached Mareeba () in 1893. The Barron Gorge section had cost nearly 3 times the original estimate, and the government, reluctant to commit to any further public expenditure on extending the Tablelands rail network, sought alternative options.Kerr 1990 Private railways The area west of Mareeba was known to be mineralised, and mining pioneer John Moffat received government approval to build a copper mine at Chillagoe, smelter at Barron Falls and railway to connect the mine to the QR line, to be the same gauge and standard as the QR line. The Chillagoe Railway & Mining Co. was created for the project, but the public outcry over the site of the smelter forced its relocation to Chillagoe, the railway then becoming vital to ship coal and coke for the smelter from the wharf at Cairns. The line opened to Mungana (), 16 km beyond Chillagoe in 1901, built with 1 in 50 (2%) grades, rail and curves, with its own locomotives but hiring rolling stock from QR. A travelling post office was provided between Cairns and Almaden () from 1911-18. Another smelter was built at Mount Garnet and a 50 km line from Lappa Junction () was opened in 1902 with 1 in 40 (2.5%) grades and radius curves. The Queensland Government purchased the line in 1915, and contracted the Chillagoe Railway to run the line. Traffic was significantly boosted from 1938 when a tin mine was opened. A gauge tramway was opened from Boonmoo () to Rocky Bluffs in 1902 to serve a further mining field, and a branch built from Stannary Hills to Irvinebank in 1907, closing in 1937. Another copper smelter was built at Mount Molloy (), and a line with 1 in 40 grades opened in 1908 from Biboohra () to serve it and a sawmill. This line was purchased by the Queensland Government in 1917 so it could be extended to a potential agricultural area, but construction was delayed for 5 years and an 11 km extension to Rumula () finally opened in 1926. The Etheridge railway was a line from Almaden to Forsayth (). It opened between 1909-1910 to provide additional ore for the Chillagoe smelter. It was built with rails, 1 in 40 grades, radius curves and low level bridges. The discovery of coal at Mount Mulligan () was a significant development for the mining fields, which were finding the cost of shipping coal and coke from the Cairns wharf a major impediment. A 48 km line was opened from Dimbulah () in 1915 using 1 in 30 (3.3%) grades in the uphill direction (1 in 40 for the grade against loaded trains). The collapse of the world copper price at the end of World War I led to the Queensland Government purchasing all the privately owned lines in 1919. The section of the Etheridge railway line west of Mount Surprise () was badly damaged by cyclonic rainfall in 1927, and from that time until 1939 the only service was provided by a railmotor which could haul two small goods wagons. The first diesel locomotive used by the Queensland Railways was introduced that year to enable the return of locomotive hauled trains to Forsayth. To the southern Atherton Tableland Although it received an offer for a private line to be built south of Mareeba, the government considered that to be prime agricultural land, and constructed the line itself, opening the line from Mareeba to Atherton () on 10 August 1903.Kerr 1990, p. 225 By the time the railway reached Herberton () on 20 October 1910 the tin mining boom was long over, and the line was being built to facilitate development. The line opened on Tumoulin on 31 July 1911 withTumoulin railway station () being Queensland’s highest railway station at above sea level. The line opened to the timber milling town of Ravenshoe () on 11 December 1916. The line used grades as steep as 1 in 33 (3%) and a tunnel at the summit to cross the Herberton Range. Millaa Millaa branch line The Queensland Government also built a branch line from Tolga, opening to Yungaburra () on 15 March 1910, to Kureen () on 18 October 1910, to Malanda on 20 December 1910, to Jaggan on 22 October 1915, to Tarzali on 15 December 1916, and finally to Millaa Millaa on 19 December 1921.Kerr 1990, p. 225 The route involveds grades of 1 in 44 (2.27%) and 5 chain [] radius curves. The line facilitated the transport of significant volumes of logs for sawmilling in its early years, but once all-weather roads were provided, traffic declined, although the grain silos at Kairi provide significant if seasonal loadings. An branch line from Peeramon (situated between Yungaburra and Malanda) south east to Boonjee was proposed in 1920 but never constructed.

A daily railmotor ran from Cairns to Ravenshoe and return. A twice weekly mixed train ran from Cairns to Forsayth until 1995, when it was replaced by the Savannahlander tourist service. Suburban services Frequent daily passenger services were provided between Cairns and Redlynch from 1927-69.

In 1999, TVE setup Ford Tickford Experience (FTE) as a competitor to Holden Special Vehicles (HSV). In 2002, the operations changed to Ford Performance Vehicles (FPV) coinciding with Tickford's global operations being bought out by Prodrive. Overview In 1990, 12 years since the last Falcon Cobra rolled off the line, Ford Australia started a worldwide search to find to engineering firm to establish a new performance arm in the same mold as rival to Holden Special Vehicles (HSV). The aim was to create a line-up of in-house performance cars that had been missing from the Falcon range since the 1970s. Ford Australia's last foray in this space was in fact represented by the 1982 XE-series \\"European Sports Pack\\" Falcon. Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, this performance void was filled by third party tuning companies such as AVO, Special Vehicle Operations (SVO) and Dick Johnson Racing (DJR). Both AVO and DJR had experimented with using turbocharged powerplants to boost the output of Falcon's venerable 4.0-Litre 6-cylinder, with DJR creating the Grand Prix Turbo based on the XE. DJR had intended his company to be set up as a performance arm not unlike Peter Brock's Holden Dealer Team (HDT), but Ford was wary of such modifications due to warranty concerns. This meant that sales of both AVO and DJR Falcons remained very limited. SVO had greater success in the creation of a range of cars, starting with the Falcon EA series SVO (a car that formed the template for the subsequent XR6), however, Ford still did not provide factory-backing. Ultimately, Ford Australia joined forces with Tickford, renowned in Europe for its modified Ford models. In 1991, Tickford Vehicle Engineering (TVE) was thus established as a joint venture between Ford Australia. TVE was involved in the creation of the Falcon XR range that emerged in 1992 with the EB series and the return of the Falcon GT. In addition, TVE was also responsible for other higher-specification Fords such as the Capri Clubsprint, and for the fitment of optional equipment such as LPG systems and sunroofs. In 1999, aside from enhancing the Falcon offering via the sporty XR range, TVE also established Ford Tickford Experience (FTE) comprising a 3-tier sedan-only T series based on the then new AU series. Managing Director, David Flint, made clear this brand's intentions by stating: \\"Tickford have helped add further refinement, safety and confidence to the T Series range. It is very easy to build a car that just goes fast, but one that handles, performs and lends itself to outstanding driving dynamics is what we have aimed for'.\\" In so doing, whilst the brand was an obvious attempt to combat the successful HSV products, FTE did not want to get into a \\"power war\\", focusing instead in providing a more sophisticated high performance product, making refinement its hallmark. Aside from Falcon-based products, over the years, FTE was also responsible for a right hand drive (RHD) conversion of the fourth-generation Mustang Cobra and for promoting the European Cougar. In 1999, TVE also bought out Glen Seaton Racing to create Ford Tickford Racing – Ford's first factory-backed team in over 30 years. With the purchase of Tickford by Prodrive in 2001, FTE was replaced by the new owner's Ford Performance Vehicles (badges as \\"FPV\\") with the introduction of the BA series Falcon range in 2002. Nevertheless, Tickford were still involved in the early development stages of some models including the BA Falcon XR6 Turbo, with early parts bearing the \\"Tickford\\" logo. Falcon XR range This range of models – not to be confused with the 1966–1968 XR series – has been a fixture of the Falcon range since 1991. From its second release in 1993, it has become characterised by, and is distinguishable from standard models thanks to, a signature quad-headlamp front styling. In addition, all factory LPG systems for the EF and EL Falcon range were installed by and badged \\"Tickford\\".http://www.computeroutpost.com.au/item/om75/ EB series In July 1991, just prior to the formation of TVE, Ford Australia itself launched the EB Falcon S-XR8 after its decision to offer again a V8 engine option for the first time since the 1982 XE-series. In 1992, TVE became responsible of the whole range. The S-XR6 model was identified by a red rocker cover with the \\"Tickford wings\\" badge, a revised head and cam saw a power increase from to . The S-XR8 was visually similar but was powered by the standard 5.0-Litre \\"Windsor\\" V8 engine. With the EBII, TVE launched an enhanced XR8 model. Both the 6 and 8 cylinder models were fitted with ABS, LSD, alloy wheels and a Momo steering wheel being standard on the S-XR6 and optional on the S-XR8. File:1991 Ford Falcon (EB) S XR8 sedan (2010-12-17).jpgEB Falcon S-XR8 ED series With this series, TVE dropped the 'S' from its range and introduced the Falcon XR's signature four-headlamp treatment, inspired by the European Ford Escort RS Cosworth. The model range comprised the XR6, the XR8 – and from September 1993 – the XR8 Sprint. The latter featured a more powerful version of the 5.0-litre \\"Windsor\\" V8 engine, courtesy of the performance upgrades fitted to the previous year's Falcon GT \\"25th Anniversary\\". The same GT also donated an improved suspension and brake package, whilst featuring unique 16-inch wheels. There was very little body alteration to identify it, other than a black (instead of red) side body strip, a pair of subtle front wheel arch moulds and \\"Sprint\\" badges on the boot and a front chin spoiler. File:1993-1994 Ford ED Falcon XR6 sedan 01.jpgED Falcon XR6 File:1993-94 ED XR8 Sprint.JPGED Falcon XR8 Sprint EF series The XR6 and XR8 models continued with the heavily re-engineered EF series Falcon, with more improvements to the suspension and drive-line. The XR range now received a 1-piece nose cone including quad headlamp surrounds, bumper and a blanked out grille similar to the base Gli model. \\"Cats scratch\\" vents were applied to the bonnet. The XR6 continued to use the same 4.0-litre inline six-cylinder shared with the base models but with Tickford alloy cylinder heads, cam and higher pressure valve springs with unique Tickford EEC programming. A press bent 2.5-inch exhaust was also added, a minor upgrade over the standard 2.25-inch system. The six-cylinder Ghia version also received the motor out of the XR6, with a quieter exhaust system. The XR6 delivers 164 kW (220 hp) at 5000 rpm up from 161 kW (216 hp) in the ED Falcon. The XR8 has a 5.0-litre OHV (over head valve) V8 delivering 170 kW (230 hp) at 4500 rpm up from the 165 kW (221 hp). LPG was not offered as a factory option on the XR6 and XR8 models File:1995 Ford Falcon (EF) XR6 sedan (18151075365).jpgEF Falcon XR6 File:Ford Falcon XR8 (16490541739) (cropped).jpgEF Falcon XR8 EL Series New frontal styling arrived with the EL, with the nose cone featuring slightly revised headlights and a slotted grille. The \\"cat scratch\\" vents found on the EF were now replaced with simplified versions on the EL. The XR6 received the same changes found in the rest of the EL range (coil-pack changed to distributor, a wide, single intake pipe opposed to the flat twin pipe of the EF). The XR6 and XR8 boasted a 164 kW (220 hp) six-cylinder and a 170 kW (228 hp) V8 respectively. In October 1997, the V8 engine fitted to the XR8 sports model was upgraded from 170 kilowatts (228 hp) to 185 (248 hp). Torque figures were also upped from 398 newton metres (294 ft·lbf) to 402 (296 ft·lbf) File:1996-98 EL XR6.JPG EL Falcon XR6 File:Ford Falcon EL XR8 (15213286123).jpg EL Falcon XR8 AU series With this new-generation Falcon, TVE retained the XR8 but split the 6-cylinder range into the XR6 HP and XR6 VCT depending on engine variant. The XR6 HP was equipped with a version of the new Intech engine (as opposed to of the standard engine) thanks to: unique cylinder head; reshaped inlet port; redesigned exhaust port; ‘open’ combustion chamber shape to restrict pre-detonation from hot spot areas; unique camshaft; higher fuel pressure; recalibrated EEC V engine management system. It also had a solid rear axle suspension setup unlike the independent rear suspension of the XR6 VCT, which also featured variable cam timing. The VCT engine was an Australian-production first. In 2001, TVE also built 125 units of the XR8 Rebel, which were characterised by a Ford Racing bodykit (instead of the standard Tickford version) and, more importantly, the \\"Synergy 5000\\" 5.0-Litre V8 version of the \\"Windsor\\" engine from the FTE T series. With this limited edition XR8, Ford also provided a Sony PlayStation 2 console with a copy of Gran Turismo 3: A-spec signed by both Glenn Seton and Steven Richards as part of the package.http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/3136554F040BA1E4CA2572100028B858 The AU III series XR8 inherited the same V8 engine as standard and the Ford Racing bodykit as an option to the standard Tickford version. A limited edition XR6 VCT Sprint also received the Ford Motorsport bodykit.

This car, however, never reached production. The fitment of the larger \\"Windsor\\" engine required substantial alterations to the engine bay to fit the engine, making the exercise too costly. Nevertheless, with the launch of the EB series in 1991, and for the first time since 1982, a V8 returned to the Falcon range thanks to a 5.0-Litre version of the \\"Windsor\\" engine. With the return of this powerplant and with TVE on board, Ford deemed it an appropriate time to bring back the legendary Falcon GT model. Thus, TVE produced a 25th Anniversary and 30th Anniversary models based on the luxury- oriented Fairmont Ghia models, rather than the sportier XR. The result was a proper Grand Tourer, with considerable driver comfort, instead of the high- powered setup of its predecessors. \\"25th Anniversary\\" Based on the EB series, the Falcon GT \\"25th Anniversary\\" was launched in 1992, after a month from the release of the S-XR6 and XR8 models. Production of this exclusive model totalled 265 units, 15 of which were sold in New Zealand. It commemorated 25 years since the introduction of the very first GT in 1967 (based on the XR series Falcon) and was also the first the badge was used on a production Falcon since the last GT of 1973 (based on the XB series). ;Body The body was adorned by a full bodykit designed by Paul Gibson, who worked on the Ford Escort RS Cosworth. The bodykit was tested in a wind tunnel in England to ensure that the additions improved aerodynamic performance. The end product was reminiscent of the Lotus Carlton, which was based on the Opel Omega that formed the basis of the rival, second-generation Holden Commodore. ;Mechanicals The GT received the Mustang Cobra version of the 5.0-Litre \\"Windsor\\", with Tickford adapting it for local conditions. The was the result of changes to the camshaft, intake and cylinder head improvements. The rest of the drivetrain consisted of regular XR components including manual transmission, with the only changes being slightly different gear ratios and recalibrated shift points for the automatic transmission. ;Performance 5-speed manual transmission (source: Wheels, November 1992) * 0–100 km/h (0-62 mph) in 7.57 seconds * 1/4 mile in 15.48 seconds * Top Speed: ;Units sold by colourhttp://www.aus-ford-uk.co.uk/html/eb_and_el_gt.html * Black Pearl (J4): 109 of which 4 were exported * Cobalt Blue (J9): 88 of which 5 were exported * Cardinal Red (G5): 68 of which 6 were exported Trim option: Ironbark (G3)http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/ford_falcon_el_gt_identification.htm \\"30th Anniversary\\" Launched in 1997, this commemorative model was an evolution of its 1992 predecessor, this time based on the then new EL series. Production of the Falcon GT \\"30th Anniversary\\" totalled 272 units (150 manuals; 122 automatics),http://www.falconforums.com.au/showthread.php?2738-EL-GT-Registry comprising 11 development cars (build allocation P001 to P011), 239 (build allocation 001 to 239 and with a limit of 4 per dealers) for Australia, 20 exported to New Zealand (build allocation NZ01 to NZ20) and 2 exported to South Africa (build allocation 240 and 241). ;Body The EL GT was quite well known for its outlandish looks, penned by then Ford Australia's design chief, Steve Park (also responsible for the ill-fated AU series Falcon). His original sketch had a silhouette akin to that of a Batmobile with a wilder wing consisting of a circular stop light mounted on a protruding centre post. However, Ford engineers opted for a more balanced approach to form and function. One of the most distinctive and polarising features was grille consisting of a vertical stacks, which lead the automotive media to name this car \\"Darth Vader\\".http://www.carsguide.com.au/car-reviews/used-car-review- ford-falcon-el-gt-1997-13126 Again, the bodykit was not just there for looks but was developed at the Monash University (alongside the EL Falcon race car program) wind tunnel to improve aerodynamics. The rear wing was said to greatly reduce aerodynamic lift at speed, and unique bonnet vents were placed in a low pressure area to help engine cooling. Wheel arch extensions were used to cover the wider EL GT 6-spoke alloy wheels.Wheels magazine, April 1997 ;Mechanicals The 5.0-Litre \\"Windsor\\" engine was locally developed in TVE's workshop. It featured a significantly re-calibrated ECU, bigger SVO GT40 cylinder heads and new 42mm headers. As a result, it produced and . TVE had considered using the 351ci version of the \\"Windsor\\" found in the EA series GT prototype, and a higher displacement version. Both projects were shelved due to the associated high costs. One of the unique features of this GT model was the special adaptive mode of its 4-speed automatic transmission developed by BTR. A computer monitored a number of inputs to select one of 5 different shift protocols, adapting to the driver's own style. To allow 30th Anniversary GT to be driven in excess of , a carbon-wrapped aluminium tailshaft was installed to eliminate the flex commonly found in standard Falcons. In July 1998, Wheels magazine reached a top speed of .Wheels magazine, July 1998 ;Suspension The car featured a front end setup unique to the model, consisting of re-shaped cast uprights to allow the use of larger discs (328mm instead of 287mm on regular falcons).

TE50, TS50, TL50 This V8 sedan-only range consisted of three levels: the short wheelbase TE50 and TS50 and the long wheelbase TL50. A distinguishing feature of the T series was a \\"FTE Premium Assist\\" package to enhance the ownership experience. Broadly speaking, the TL50 was based on the Ford Fairlane and the TS50 on the Fairmont Ghia. They all featured a \\"Premium\\" braking system. By contrast, the T1 and T2 series TE50 was based on a Fairmont (down to its velour-trimmed interior), however, in T2 series the TE50's braking system was downgraded to that of the Falcon XR8http://australiancar.reviews/reviews.php#!content=review&make;=Ford&model;=TE50&gen;=268http://pandora.nla.gov.au/nph- wb/20001122130000/http://www.fte.ford.com.au/mainFrameset2542.htmlhttp://www.eccosoftware.com.au/FTE/t-series/vehicles/techFrameset_files/fte_tech_main.htm (the \\"Premium\\" braking system becoming optional but standard again on the T3 series), and the T3 also inherited the Falcon XR8 dashboard but with a leather-trimmed only interior.http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/19595E11583ABA1FCA256B100004312C An upgraded \\"Premium\\" braking system was otherwise standard on every TS50 and TL50. T-Series, AU (T1) The first FTE followed the launch of the brand- new AU series Falcon a month later, in October 1998. The controversial looks of the donor car were lessened courtesy of better designed bumper bars and larger wheels, as well as more luxurious interiors, at least on the TS50 and TL50 models. ;Body Each model featured a styling kit that consisted of unique front and rear bumper bars and side skirts. A key distinguishing feature was the large chrome-mesh grille and \\"T\\" badges throughout. To identify the separate Falcon-based models, each had a unique front fascia, with the TS50 gaining driving lights in place of the brake ducts of the TE50. The TE50 had 17-inch wheels whereas the TS50 and TL50 went up to 18-inch. Aiming for a more sophisticated look compared to its rival HSV, FTE fit only low-profile rear wings on the Falcon-derived models and no wing on the more luxury-oriented TL50. Paint options were limited to Silhouette (black), Liquid Silver and Sparkling Burgundy on the TS50 and TL50; with the TE50 having an additional option: Galaxy (metallic dark blue). ;Mechanicals All T Series models used the familiar Windsor V8 Engine renamed \\"Synergy 5000\\", but was hand built to provide more power over the XR8's standard and it also feature an engraved plaque with the signature of its builder. The TE50 and TL50 models were equipped with a version, whilst the TS50 gained aluminium cylinder heads, a larger throttle body and a revised camshaft to produce . The TE50 was available with a 5-speed manual or optional 4-speed automatic transmission. This transmission was the only choice on the TS50 and TL50. Along with being combined with traction control, the 4-speed automatic had ESS (Electronic Sports Shift), which was an Australian-production first by providing buttons on the steering wheels allowing for manual gear shifting. Inside, each car featured Momo steering wheels and shift buttons.http://www.tseriesclub.org/technical-spec/ An upgraded Premium braking system was standard on all models, and both the TS50 and TL50 benefitted from Koni suspension components. ;Performance TE50 * 0–100 km/h (0-62 mph) in 7.3 seconds * 0-400m (1/4 mile) in 15.2 seconds TS50 * 0–100 km/h (0-62 mph) in 7.1 seconds * 0-400m (1/4 mile) in 15.2 seconds Build Numbers * TE50: 104 * TS50: 54 * TL50: 43 T-Series, AUII (T2) This second series was sold in parallel with the AU II series Falcon of 2000–2001, which benefited from structural and interior upgrades. The TE50, for example, could now be had with the previous car's suede-velour interior or a new leather trim with either red or blue inserts and embroidered logos, matched to the Momo steering wheel, gear knob and door trim. In addition, bumper inserts and rear wing were a delete option.http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/C4A592C77BC2EE45CA256B030004BABC For the first time, these models could also be optioned with satellite navigation. ;Body The look of the T2 was revised side skirts bearing each model's insignia, and accent grey inserts on front and rear bumpers.http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/3A6506CB7631FC78CA2569FA0014722C The TE50 now featured the Falcon XR's rear wing as standard, while the TS50 still carried a low-profile model as standard. Wheels sizes did not differ although any model could now be optioned with the new Azzurro 18-inch wheels. The following new colours were introduced: Venom Red, Narooma Blue (which replaced Galaxy Blue midway through the series) while Liquid Silver and Sparkling Burgundy were dropped. ;Mechanicals All these T-Series models now featured the engine previously reserved for the TS50. In addition, the latter could now be had with a 5-speed manual transmission. The TE50 was downgraded to Falcon XR8 brakes, with the Premium package becoming optional. ;Performance TE50 *0–100 km/h (0-62 mph) in 6.7 seconds *0-400m (1/4 mile) in 14.7 in seconds Build Numbers * TE50: 141 * TS50: 46 * TL50: 12 T3 TS50 side skirt badge T-Series, AUIII (T3) This third and final T series was sold in parallel with the AU III series Falcon of 2001–2002. At this time, with the \\"Windsor\\" being replaced by Ford's \\"Romeo\\" modular V8 architecture worldwide, FTE received the last allotment of these engine blocks allowing FTE to produce 248 units of the Falcon XR8 Pursuit 250 Ute, which was sold as a Ford. The TE50 and TS50 also suffered some interior downgrades: the former lost its Fairmont dashboard for that of a Falcon XR8; and the TS50 lost the same luxury seats it shared with the TL50. ;Body The T3 abandoned the original sophisticated look, to deliver a more powerful look. In fact, all models were now equipped with 18-inch wheels and an all new V8 Racing-inspired bodykit, which consisted of a deeper chin spoiler, tall boot mounted wing and chunkier side and rear fascia extensions. For the first time, the TE50 was fitted with foglights. The rear wing was claimed to offer more rear end grip above 100 km/h. With this bodykit, FTE departed from Ford's internal guidelines regarding defined manufacturing parameters such as departure angles. The result was the most visually aggressive Falcon vehicles since the GT 30th Anniversary of 1997. Blueprint, Congo Green and Monsoon Blue were three new colours offered across the range. The TE50 now featured the Azzurro alloy wheels as standard, and it could also be optioned with the Koni suspension components fitted to the TS50 and TL50. The TL50 continued with little success, given the slow death of the donor Fairlane by that time. ;Mechanicals All T3 models were now fitted with a 5.6-Litre \\"stroker\\" version of the \\"Windsor\\" block. An all-new crankshaft, ported cylinder head and a three-piece high flow inlet manifold and conical air cleaner, resulted in engine outputs rising to and . As a result, these models were known for being the fastest, most powerful naturally-aspirated Falcons, until the release of the Boss 290 powered GT Falcons. Because of the short development period of 10 months, all T series models no longer featured traction control, which was previously available only on the automatics. They could nevertheless now be optioned with a Brembo braking system, which was superior to the FTE \\"Premium\\" package.

The resulting Capri Clubsprint was based on the Turbo XR2 version but with added suspension upgrades to improve handling, and a bespoke bodykit (making the car strictly a 2-seater) with larger 16-inch alloy wheels. In total, TVE built 200 units. Fairlane by Tickford In 1998, TVE made a number of improvements to the NL series Fairlane Ghia marketed the resulting car as the Fairlane By Tickford. Using the upgrades from the EL series Falcon GT \\"30th Anniversary\\" of 1997 and Ford Motorsport parts, the engine received different heads and an intake manifold resulting in a power output of , up from standard Fairlane's . The FBT also benefitted from the said GT's bigger brake package and an sportier interior. A total of 106 were produced, only available in Navy Blue or Regency Red. 1998 NL Fairlane by Tickford This long wheelbase forerunner to the TL50 was a very special limited edition apart from its tiny 106 production run. This model was the first local ford to carry the new Tickford T-Series badges . It was effectively a long wheelbase version of the EL GT but there were key mechanical differences as it became the first local Ford to offer the US Explorer's revised Windsor V8 with the GT40P heads. It is sometimes known as the Fairlane 195. The special engine in this model featured the GT40P heads, the revised Explorer upper and lower inlet manifolds, 65 mm throttle body, 70 mm airflow meter, Motorsport injectors and special extractors. Torque was lifted to a hefty 410 Nm, a welcome boost for a model that was as spacious and luxuriously-equipped as this one. The exterior was dominated by a more purposeful mesh grille and the large flat-spoked 17 inch alloy wheels. Combined with its lower ride height, there was no mistaking it for an everyday Fairlane on VIP duty. The GT theme extended to the interior which included sports-contoured front seats, leather and wood-rimmed Momo 4 spoke steering wheel and leather trim accents on doors, dash and centre console. Walnut inserts matching the Momo wheel were added to the door tops and T-bar surround while door handles were polished chrome. A premium 250 Watt 9 speaker audio system and alarm were also standard. This premium model came only in Navy Blue or Regency Red.

Sales, however, were low due to shrinking demand and lack of public awareness of the Cougar name. In August 2000, FTE released 100 units of the Cougar Eibach, which featured sportier suspension and a bodykit based on a US market item, but further modified by Tickford for the Australian market. This FTE model was discontinued in April 2001. The Cougar range was discontinued in March 2004. Mustang SVT Cobra In 2001, to combat the release of the third-generation Holden Monaro, TVE set out on a massive project to re- engineer the fourth-generation Mustang SVT Cobra for Australia. This involved substantial revisions to the body, electronics and drivetrain. More than 250 changes were made by the time a RHD conversion was finished. The process started on the assembly line in the US, where a windscreen that conformed to the Australia Design Rules (ADR) was fitted in addition to revised wiring for the seat electronics. Other parts – such as for the lights and exhaust – were swapped in favour of Japanese specification items given they required lesser revisions to meet the ADR. In total, 250 units were sold between 2001 and 2002. One of the biggest challenges presented by this project was the floor pan, since in left hand drive, the driver had the most space available. The engine and gearbox offset had to be reversed with the use of Tickford engineered brackets, and unique floor pan sections, to achieve the necessary space for the driver in RHD. In addition, an all new dashboard and interior trimmings had to be installed. In effect, TVE re-manufactured the Mustang at a cost of A$4 million remaining the biggest ever project for Tickford in Australia. Sales did not meet expectations, including due to a very high A$85,000 retail price. AFD 22.jpgFTE Mustang Cobra Concept cars TVE also developed a range of concept cars for a variety of automotive shows around Australia. These cars were developed not only to grab attention in favour of Ford products but also to display various technological features. * Falcon XR8 Sequential sedan (EL-series): powered by a modified 5.0-Litre V8 engine producing over , its key feature was a Harrop-engineered and built sequential shift transmission; it also received a re-trimmed leather interior, upgraded brakes and suspension, 19-inch alloy wheels, twin bonnet air scoops and Mexican Fire paint that changed from gold to red depending on light conditions. * Falcon Predator sedan (EL-series): based on a Falcon Futura sedan, it was powered by a supercharged LPG version of its 6-cylinder engine boosting output to ; it also received a re-trimmed Momo-leather interior with upgraded sound system, upgraded brakes, 18-inch wheels and it was painted in Orange Copper. * Mustang V10 convertible (4th generation): created in conjunction with Herrod Automotive in 2001 as a Ford Racing Australia exhibition car for use during V8 Supercar and other motorsport events around Australia, it had its standard 4.6-Litre V8 replaced by a Ford Modular 6.8-Litre V10 engine from the American F truck series but fitted with a Sprintex supercharger.http://www.autospeed.com.au/cms/A_1575/article.html  Motorsport  In 1999, Glenn Seton's V8 Supercar racing outfit was bought out by Ford and rebranded Ford Tickford Racing. It expanded to a 2 race car operation, with Neil Crompton the second driver. This marked the first time since 1973 that Ford officially backed a team into the Australian touring car championship. Eventually, Ford diverted attention to Gibson Motorsport, leaving Glenn Seton to run without factory backing, until his team was acquired by Prodrive at the end of 2002, to become Ford Performance Racing.

History The lighthouse as seen at the edge of Ponta de Sagres, the extreme southwest corner of continental Portugal As part of the 5th centenary commemorations marking the birth of Henry the Navigator, in 1894 the lighthouse was inaugurated. The third navigational advisory, dated 3 March 1894, indicated that he light was a fixed red beacon, with a , using a petroleum lamp. On 28 November 1906, the 5th order diopter lamp was substituted by an optical device of greater range. This lantern was lit on 23 June 1923, following the construction of a new building with the installation of a 4th order catadioptric optical lamp, that was originally installed in the lighthouse of Ponta da Piedade. Between 1947-1949, the lighthouse was transferred to the Ministry of the Navy. The illumination source was changed to an electric incandescent lamp following the installation of power generators. In 1958, it was decided to demolish the building, due to its historic inadequacy, and a new structure was constructed from the old building. Budgeted at 146.890$00 escudos (733.00 euros), the new lighthouse was inaugurated on 1 April 1960. The lighthouse was automatized in 1979. In August 1983, the lighthouse began to be controlled from a distance, from the Cape St. Vincent Lighthouse, and integrated into the special protection zone of the fortress of Sagres. Architecture The lighthouse tower is , the light is located at about altitude and has a range of . The lamp is characterized by a luminous red beacon that flashes at a two-second interval. The rotation of the optical beacon is produced from clock mechanism.

Introduced in A Game of Thrones (1996) and subsequently in A Clash of Kings (1998) and A Storm of Swords (2000), Tyrion was one of a few prominent characters that were not included in A Feast for Crows (2005) but returned in A Dance with Dragons (2011), and is confirmed to appear in the forthcoming sixth novel The Winds of Winter. The popularity of the character led Martin and Bantam Books to publish in 2013 The Wit & Wisdom of Tyrion Lannister, an illustrated collection of Tyrion quotes from the novels. Tyrion is the second son and youngest child of Lord Tywin Lannister of Casterly Rock, the patriarch of House Lannister, one of the wealthiest and most powerful families in the fictional continent of Westeros, and Tywin's beloved first cousin and wife Lady Joanna Lannister. As Tyrion is born a dwarf and his mother died during childbirth, he is resented by Tywin since birth. In the story, Tyrion uses his status as a Lannister to mitigate the prejudice he has received all of his life, even from his own family, especially his father Tywin and sister Cersei. Knowing that no one will ever take him seriously, he soothes his inadequacies with wine, wit and self-indulgence. As the peaceful rule of King Robert Baratheon begins to decay, Tyrion sees how ill-equipped his family is at holding everything together. He first saves his own neck from the vengeful Catelyn Stark and her sister Lysa Arryn, and then is sent by his father Tywin to impose order on the capital of King's Landing, as well as his nephew Joffrey, the new king, as the civil war begins. Tyrion struggles to strengthen and protect the city and family who hate him and refuse to see the peril they are in; when his father returns, Tyrion becomes vulnerable to the wrath and machinations of the self- serving courtiers who surround Joffrey, including Tyrion's own scheming sister Cersei. Tyrion escapes death again but at great cost and in fleeing Westeros finds himself in even more danger and without his usual Lannister resources. The character is portrayed by American actor Peter Dinklage in the HBO television adaptation Game of Thrones, a role for which he has received significant and widespread critical acclaim. In 2011, Dinklage won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series and later the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Miniseries, or Television Film for his portrayal of Tyrion in the HBO series. He won the Emmy again in 2015, 2018 and 2019. Among other accolades, Dinklage has been nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2016, making him the only Game of Thrones actor to receive a Primetime Emmy and the only actor to receive a nomination for each season. Character=Description In A Game of Thrones (1996), Tyrion is introduced as the third and youngest child of wealthy and powerful Tywin Lannister, the former Hand of the King, and Joanna Lannister, who dies giving birth to him. Tyrion's elder sister Cersei is the Queen of Westeros by virtue of her marriage to King Robert Baratheon, and Cersei's male twin Jaime is one of the Kingsguard, the royal bodyguard. Described as an ugly (\\"for all the world like a gargoyle\\"), malformed dwarf with different colored eyes, green and black, Tyrion possesses the golden blond hair of a Lannister but has a complicated relationship with the rest of them. While he is afforded the privilege and luxuries of his family, he is treated as a \\"second class noble\\" because of his stature. Tyrion's mother Joanna died giving birth to him and Tywin and Cersei loathe him because they blame him for her death. While Tywin bears no affection for Tyrion, he nevertheless feels a sense of duty to his son, raising him in the Lannister fold and extending Tyrion a share of the family wealth. In contrast to Tywin and Cersei, Jaime has great affection for Tyrion and treats him with kindness, respect, friendship and love. Lev Grossman of Time wrote in 2011: Tyrion is intelligent, witty, well-read, and shares his father's skill for business and political maneuvering. Grossman describes the character as \\"a bitter, cynical, high-born dwarf\\", calling him \\"Martin's Falstaff\\". David Orr of The New York Times notes Tyrion to be \\"a cynic, a drinker, an outcast and conspicuously the novels' most intelligent presence\\". As an outcast, he displays sympathy for other outcasts and the otherwise mistreated; the TV series version of the character commiserates with the illegitimate son of Ned Stark by saying, \\"All dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes.\\" Still, he is usually seen for his deformities and vices, rather than his virtues and good deeds. Tom Shippey of the Wall Street Journal points out that other characters underestimate Tyrion: \\"His dwarf-status acts as a kind of protection, because—though he is probably the most intelligent character in the whole cast list—no one takes him seriously.\\" Acknowledging that Tyrion's wit, humor and cunning are his survival mechanism, actor Dinklage told The New York Times that \\"He knows he has no skills with the sword and this is a world that is really deeply violent. Military rules. He would not be able to survive in that world, given his own strength. So he beats people to the punchline—he's entertaining.\\" Creation and overview In 1981, Martin was collaborating with Lisa Tuttle on a trio of novellas that would be published as the novel Windhaven: Tyrion is a prominent point of view character in the novels, and both David Orr of The New York Times and Lev Grossman of Time called him one of Martin's \\"finest creations.\\" Noting the character to be one of Martin's most popular, Dana Jennings of The New York Times called Tyrion \\"a bitter but brilliant dwarf whose humor, swagger and utter humanity make him the (often drunken) star of the series\\". Thomas M. Wagner wrote in 2001 that the character \\"may very well be the strongest antihero in all of contemporary fantasy\\". Dan Kois of The New York Times also noted in 2012 that \\"for fans of the novels, Tyrion is among the most beloved among the scores of kings, warriors, wenches, slaves, queens and monsters that populate George R. R. Martin's world\\". Martin said, \\"My readers identify with the outcast, with the underdog, with the person who's struggling rather than the golden boy\\". Martin himself has singled out Tyrion as his favorite character in the series. Asked why, Martin said in a 2000 interview: Tyrion appears first in A Game of Thrones (1996), and then in A Clash of Kings (1998) and A Storm of Swords (2000). He is one of a handful of \\"sorely missed\\" major characters that do not appear in 2005's A Feast for Crows, but on his website in 2006 Martin released a sample chapter featuring Tyrion from his next novel A Dance with Dragons. In advance of the publication of A Dance with Dragons in 2011, Martin confirmed Tyrion's presence in the novel and called him one of \\"the characters people have been waiting for\\". Grossman concurred, writing of A Dance with Dragons, \\"Now the camera has swung back to the main characters: Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen and Tyrion Lannister.\\" James Poniewozik of Time added that the return of these \\"favorite characters\\" gave A Dance with Dragons a \\"narrative edge\\" over A Feast for Crows. In April 2012, Martin read a Tyrion chapter from his forthcoming The Winds of Winter at Eastercon; a second Tyrion chapter was read at Worldcon in August 2013 and later released in the official A World of Ice and Fire iOS application on March 20, 2014. In 2013, Bantam Books published The Wit & Wisdom of Tyrion Lannister, an illustrated collection of Tyrion quotes from the novels. Development As A Game of Thrones begins, Tyrion is a witty, hedonistic curiosity, protected by his family status but still the object of subtle derision. He is perhaps the most intelligent member of his family but is consistently underestimated and marginalized. Tyrion embraces the advantages of being a Lannister but at the same time is all too aware of its negative aspects and his own place as the embarrassment of the family. Initially he is the one Lannister remotely sympathetic to the Starks but he is soon caught in the middle of the conflict between the two Houses. Taken prisoner and put on trial for his life, \\"all of his skills at conniving must be brought to bear simply to stay alive\\". With the Starks and Lannisters fully at war, Tywin tasks Tyrion to manage affairs at King's Landing, recognizing that his son is intelligent and has inherited his skills with statecraft. In A Clash of Kings, Tyrion relishes his new power but finds that his sincere efforts to stabilize his nephew Joffrey's rule are being undermined and thwarted by the misguided and self-serving machinations of everyone around him. He plots to nullify the counterproductive whims of Joffrey and Cersei but the \\"much-maligned dwarf\\" finds himself \\"teetering between order and disaster as he tries to keep the Lannisters from losing absolutely everything\\". Thomas M. Wagner calls it a \\"defining moment\\" when Tyrion comments that he is all that keeps chaos from overwhelming the family and population who both despise him. Roberta Johnson of Booklist likens Tyrion to the calculating title character of Robert Graves' I, Claudius. In A Storm of Swords, Tywin reclaims the office of Hand of the King and gives Tyrion the seemingly-impossible task of reforming the royal finances. Tyrion's previous efforts, crucial in keeping Joffrey in power and saving King's Landing from invasion are all but forgotten. Joffrey, emboldened by Tywin's return, publicly humiliates Tyrion; when Joffrey is murdered, everyone eagerly points the finger at Tyrion. Cersei does everything in her power to assure that he is declared guilty at trial. Innocent but condemned to death and hated more than ever, Tyrion takes a dark turn. Martin explains: Finding his former lover Shae in his father's bed, Tyrion strangles her. Confronting Tywin with a crossbow soon after, he murders him too. To Martin, \\"the two actions are quite different, although they occur within moments of each other\\". The author continues, \\"He's furious at Lord Tywin because he found out the truth about his first wife and what happened to her, and ... Lord Tywin is convinced that since he doesn't love Tyrion, then no one can possibly love Tyrion.\\" As Tywin repeatedly calls Tyrion's tragic first wife Tysha a \\"whore,\\" Tyrion warns him to stop. Tywin has always taught his son that you must follow through on your threats if you are defied, so when he fails to heed Tyrion's warning, the dwarf kills him. \\"And it will haunt him. Tywin was his father and that will continue to haunt him, probably for the rest of his life,\\" says the author. To Martin, Shae's murder is something else: \\"Fan-favorite\\" Tyrion returns to the narrative in A Dance with Dragons, as he flees Westeros following the murders of Shae and Tywin \\"in a state of shock at his own actions\\". Across the narrow sea in Pentos and Slaver's Bay he soon finds himself \\"in just about the most humiliating and dire circumstances in a life that has seen more than its share of such\\". Cut off from his family's wealth and influence, he must use his wits to survive. As Booklist notes, \\"his astonishing adaptability evident as he goes from captive to conspirator to slave to mercenary without losing his tactical influence\\". Still in possession of the \\"cruel wit that has seen him through in the past\\", Tyrion provides, according to Thomas M. Wagner, the \\"warmest and most sympathetic moments\\" in the novel. Storylines Coat of arms of House Lannister A Game of Thrones Tyrion accompanies King Robert Baratheon's entourage to visit the Stark stronghold of Winterfell, and disciplines his nephew Prince Joffrey when the latter refuses to pay respect to the recently crippled Bran Stark. He then opts to visit the Wall with a Night's Watch convoy, and befriends Ned Stark's bastard son Jon Snow at Castle Black. For his friendship with Jon, Tyrion visits Winterfell again on the return and designs with a specialized saddle to help Bran ride a horse. However at the Crossroad Inn, Tyrion encounters Ned's wife Catelyn, who accuses him of hiring an assassin to kill Bran and arrests him by enlisting nearby men-at-arms. Catelyn then takes the captured Tyrion to the Eyrie in the Vale, so he can be judged by Catelyn's sister Lysa Arryn. Tyrion denies the charges and demands a trial by combat, and is championed by a sellsword named Bronn, who wins the duel and secures Tyrion's freedom. Using his wit and the promise of a reward, Tyrion wins over the mountain tribes as his personal bodyguards while on his way to the Lannister army camp. He then participates in the Battle on the Green Fork, sent as the vanguard by his father Tywin Lannister. Finally impressed with Tyrion's capabilities, Tywin dispatches Tyrion to the capital city King's Landing as the acting Hand of the King in an attempt to control King Joffrey and Queen Cersei's political recklessness. While at the camp, Tyrion beds a camp follower named Shae and takes her with him to the capital. A Clash of Kings Tyrion arrives at King's Landing and immediately recognizes the chaos created by Joffrey and Cersei's abuse of power. Seeking to consolidate power and preserve order in the capital, Tyrion methodically identifies and removes Cersei's supporters. Disgusted by Joffrey's behavior and Cersei's failure to control him, Tyrion openly opposes the young king and tries to keep the hostage Sansa Stark out of harm's way. When Stannis Baratheon is marching to siege King's Landing, Tyrion masterminds the capital's defense, even personally leading a sortie that drives Stannis from the gates. When fighting on the burning wreckage of Stannis fleet, Tyrion is attacked and grievously wounded by the Kingsguard knight Ser Mandon Moore, but is saved by his young squire Podrick Payne. Tyrion suspects Joffrey or Cersei behind the assassination attempt, but is unable to get revenge on either. A Storm of Swords Upon his recovery from the injury sustained at Blackwater, Tyrion finds that he has lost most of his nose, and a returned Tywin has assumed the position of Hand himself and removed Tyrion from power. Tyrion is then appointed Master of Coin as a \\"reward\\" for his successful leadership (which is really the burden of fixing the Crown's fiscal mess). After learning of the Tyrell plot to claim Winterfell through marriage to Sansa, Tywin forces Tyrion to marry her instead. Sympathetic to Sansa's situation, Tyrion leaves their marriage unconsummated, despite his father's orders to conceive a child with her as soon as possible. Tyrion is also given the difficult task of hosting the visiting Dornish convoy from the hostile House Martell. At the celebration of Joffrey's wedding to Margaery Tyrell, Joffrey openly humiliates Tyrion but later dies from poisoned wine. Cersei promptly accuses and arrests Tyrion. His previous good deeds forgotten, Tyrion is put on trial as Cersei manipulates the proceedings to ensure a guilty verdict. He is heartbroken to find that Shae has also turned against him and openly humiliates him in court. In his grief and anger, Tyrion demands a trial by combat, to which Cersei responds by naming the formidable Ser Gregor Clegane as her champion. After Bronn has been bribed into not fighting for Tyrion, Prince Oberyn Martell surprisingly agrees to become Tyrion's champion so he can fight Gregor, but dies in the duel and hence Tyrion loses the trial. Pronounced guilty, Tyrion is taken to the dungeon on death row, but a recently returned Jaime frees him with the help of spymaster Varys and eventually confesses his complicity in Tywin's ruin of Tyrion's first wife Tysha. Furious, Tyrion swears revenge on his family for a lifetime of cruelty, falsely admits to murdering Joffrey and reveals Cersei's promiscuity in order to hurt Jaime. Before escaping the palace, Tyrion acquires a secret passage from Varys into Tywin's chamber, and finds Shae naked in Tywin's bed. After strangling her in a rage, Tyrion confronts and corners Tywin on the privy with a crossbow. When Tywin speaks ill of Tysha, Tyrion fatally shoots his father before fleeing Westeros in a ship organized by Varys. A Dance with Dragons Tyrion is taken to Pentos, where he finds himself under the protection of wealthy Magister Illyrio Mopatis. There he learns that Varys and Illyrio have secretly plotted to reinstate the Targaryen dynasty since the murder of the Mad King Aerys II. On Illyrio's advice, Tyrion agrees to seek out and join Aerys' surviving daughter Daenerys at Meereen and help her reclaim the Iron Throne. He realizes that two of his traveling companions are not what they seem — one sellsword named \\"Griff\\" is Jon Connington, Crown Prince Rhaegar's close friend and Aerys' disgraced former Hand of the King; the other teenager named \\"Young Griff\\" is claimed to be Rhaegar's supposely slain son Aegon, whom Varys allegedly had spirited away and replaced with another baby who was instead killed by Gregor Clegane during the Lannisters' sack of King's Landing. Tyrion then uses a game of cyvasse to sabotage Illyrio's plan by persuading Young Griff abandoning the idea of alliance with Daenerys. While stopping at the trading town Selhorys on the way to Volantis, Tyrion visits a brothel and is recognized and abducted by an exiled Jorah Mormont, who believes that delivering a Lannister to Daenerys will return himself to her good graces. After negotiating a passage to Meereen along with a dwarf girl named Penny, their ship is disabled by a violent storm and all of them are captured and enslaved by the Yunkai'i slavers currently besieging the Meereen. During the armistice, Tyrion and Penny are forced to perform mock jousts riding pigs in the fighting pits of Meereen, which are actually staged as a spectacle to have them eventually eaten by lions, but they are saved when Daenerys intervenes and stops the show. When the plague of bloody flux strikes the slavers' siege camps, Tyrion engineers their escape by murdering the overseer with poisonous mushrooms, and they join the sellsword company the Second Sons, whose leader Ben Plumm knows Jorah. In exchange for membership, Tyrion promises the company the wealth of Casterly Rock, his birthright since Tywin is dead and Jaime has renounced it to join the Kingsguard. Tyrion quickly realizes the Yunkai'i forces are on the losing side, and attempts to convince the Second Sons to change their allegiance.  The Winds of Winter  Tyrion was confirmed by Martin as a returning character in the upcoming sixth book, with two chapters currently released to the public. One chapter was read by Martin at Eastercon in April 2012, and another one at Worldcon in August 2013, the second of which was later published in the official iOS app on March 20, 2014. While in the Second Sons, Tyrion attempts to persuade Ben Plumm into rejoining Daenerys over a game of cyvasse. News of the Iron Fleet (led by Victarion Greyjoy) entering Slaver's Bay reaches the encampment. While the Second Sons are preparing for the battle that rages around them, news arrives that the fellow sellsword company Windblown has defected to Daenerys. In a meeting of their officers where the Yunkish commander demands they reinforce a trebuchet under attack by Daenerys' Unsullied, Jorah kills the Yunkish messenger, and Ben Plumm declares the Second Sons will rejoin Daenerys. Family tree of House LannisterTV adaptation Executive producers/writers David Benioff and D. B. Weiss had pitched the idea of adapting Martin's series for television to HBO in March 2006, and the network secured the rights in January 2007. The first actor cast was Peter Dinklage as Tyrion in May 2009. Benioff and Weiss later noted that the funny and \\"incredibly smart\\" Dinklage was their first choice for the role, as the actor's \\"core of humanity, covered by a shell of sardonic dry wit, is pretty well in keeping with the character.\\" Unfamiliar with the source material, Dinklage was cautious in his first meeting with the producers; as a dwarf, \\"he wouldn't play elves or leprechauns\\" and – choosy about genre roles – he had just come from portraying the dwarf Trumpkin in 2008's The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian. Benioff and Weiss told Dinklage that the character was \\"a different kind of fantasy little person,\\" or in the actor's words, \\"No beard, no pointy shoes, a romantic, real human being.\\" Dinklage signed on to play Tyrion before the meeting was half over, in part because \\"They told me how popular he was.\\" Martin said of Dinklage's casting, \\"If he hadn't accepted the part, oh, boy, I don't know what we would have done.\\" Benioff added, \\"When I read George's books, I decided Tyrion Lannister was one of the great characters in literature. Not just fantasy literature – literature! A brilliant, caustic, horny, drunken, self-flagellating mess of a man. And there was only one choice to play him.\\" In October 2014, Dinklage and several other key cast members, all contracted for six seasons of the series, renegotiated their deals to include a potential seventh season and salary increases for seasons five, six, and seven. The Hollywood Reporter called the raises \\"huge\\", noting that the deal would make the performers \\"among the highest-paid actors on cable TV\\". Deadline Hollywood put the number for season five at \\"close to $300,000 an episode\\" for each actor, and The Hollywood Reporter wrote in June 2016 that the performers would each be paid \\"upward of $500,000 per episode\\" for seasons seven and the potential eight. In 2017, Dinklage became one of the highest paid actors on television and will earn £2 million per episode for the show. Storylines A costume worn by Peter Dinklage in the TV series Game of Thrones Seasons 1 and 2 (2011–12) follow the events of A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings, respectively. The plot of A Storm of Swords was split into seasons 3 and 4 (2013–14). Both season 5 and season 6 adapt material from A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons, novels whose plots run concurrently and each contain different characters. Though the HBO series has alternately extended, abbreviated, conflated and diverged from the novels' plot lines, Tyrion's character and story arc have remained mostly consistent with Martin's writing. =Season 1= Calling the character the \\"black sheep\\" of the Lannister family, TV Guide wrote as the show premiered in 2011 that \\"Tyrion sees through all the chicanery and decides the best option is to drink and bed his way through the Seven Kingdoms.\\" The Boston Globe added that he is \\"a hedonistic intellectual who can talk his way out of anything.\\" According to the Los Angeles Times, \\"brilliant but low-living\\" Tyrion is \\"so well acquainted with the workings of the world he can hardly bear it, the Imp is ... debauched, perhaps, but a truth-teller nonetheless, fighting for his own survival with as much mercy as he can spare.\\" The New York Times went as far as to name Tyrion \\"the closest thing to a hero\\" in the HBO series. As in A Game of Thrones, Tyrion travels to Winterfell with the royal family, and accompanies Ned Stark's bastard son Jon Snow on his journey to the Wall. On his way back to King's Landing, Tyrion is seized by Catelyn Stark, who suspects him of having plotted to assassinate her son Bran. Taken to the Eyrie, where Catelyn's sister Lysa Arryn rules as regent, Tyrion is put to trial. Tyrion demands trial by combat, naming as his champion the sellsword Bronn, who is victorious. The two meet up with Tyrion's father Tywin, whose forces are fighting Robb Stark's army as retaliation for his capture. Tyrion is accidentally knocked unconscious as the battle begins. Tywin sends Tyrion to King's Landing to act as Hand of the King. Disobeying Tywin's orders, Tyrion takes the prostitute Shae with him. =Season 2= During the second season, Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times wrote that \\"Tyrion is just about the only character developing any complexity. Maybe even a glimmer of a conscience.\\" Emily Nussbaum of The New Yorker noted, \\"If the show has a hero, it's Tyrion (Dinklage), who is capable of cruelty but also possesses insight and empathy, concealed beneath a carapace of Wildean wit.\\" The Hollywood Reporter called Tyrion \\"the one to watch, as he's the smartest Lannister and knows that having a brat for a king – who mistreats all those around him – could cause major backlash.\\" Willa Paskin of Salon called the character's increased prominence in Season 2 \\"a trade up in entertainment value, and a trade-off in morality.\\" She added, \\"Tyrion is more cynical, more manipulative and much better suited to surviving. He's not so keen to be made into meat, and that makes him the kind of man characters in the show and audience members alike should be investing in.\\" Praising Dinklage, Dan Kois of The New York Times wrote, \\"He plays Tyrion as the only modern man in a muddy, violent, primal world. He loves good food, good conversation and a good book. Unlike the warmongering lords and knights of Westeros, but like most HBO subscribers, he would prefer to stay out of battle.\\" Kois adds that, \\"Dinklage's bravado masks Tyrion's deep well of melancholy.\\" Of the Season 2 storyline, Dinklage noted that Tyrion enjoys not only his foray into battle, but also his new and unprecedented power at court. He said, \\"This is a character that's been shit upon his whole life. I mean, he comes from great wealth, but he's treated very poorly, so now there's a newfound respect where if somebody calls him a name, he can have them killed. He never had that before. Tyrion definitely enjoys that part and he's trying desperately to hold onto it. He's enjoying it while it lasts 'cause he's not sure it's gonna last very long.\\" As Varys the Spymaster tells Tyrion, power is \\"a trick, a shadow on the wall ... and a very small man can cast a very large shadow.\\" As Hand of the King, Tyrion attempts to control his cruel and incompetent nephew Joffrey, and defend Kings Landing from Stannis Baratheon, the rival claimant to the Iron Throne. Tyrion destroys much of Stannis' attacking fleet with wildfire, but is almost assassinated during the battle, presumably at Joffrey's or Cersei's command. Tyrion recovers to find himself stripped of power by his returned father, and without recognition for his heroics. Shae implores Tyrion to move to Pentos with her, but he opts to remain in Kings Landing. =Season 3= Season 2 leaves Tyrion \\"broke, beaten, scarred for life and stripped of his power,\\" despite having been instrumental in saving King's Landing from invasion. It is his chance to escape the sordid and deadly \\"game of thrones,\\" but he cannot bring himself to, confessing, \\"Bad people are what I'm good at.\\" So Tyrion finds he must submit to Tywin's plan of marrying him to Sansa Stark; despite being drunk in order to soothe his many woes, Tyrion manages to save Sansa from being publicly stripped and likely raped by Joffrey, and later \\"chooses decency over filial loyalty and elects not to consummate the marriage after all.\\" Tyrion is also now powerless against Joffrey's malice, but Tywin has asserted his control over the young king, if only when it serves his own desires; he stops Joffrey from presenting Sansa with her brother's head, but not because he cares about Sansa or Tyrion's outrage. Despite Tywin's continuous determination to make Tyrion feel \\"miserable and unloved,\\" he believes he is a good father – because he resisted the urge to cast Tyrion into the sea at birth. Though he should not be surprised by his father's coldblooded machinations, Tyrion is horrified by Tywin's involvement in the Red Wedding; Emily VanDerWerff writes, \\"only Tyrion seems to understand that the blood they spilled will eventually be avenged. The North may have calmed for now, but it won't be calm always.\\" Of that storyline, Matt Fowler of IGN notes, \\"Only an event that powerful could keep series-favorite Tyrion out of an episode for the first time.\\" Tyrion asks Tywin to be named heir to House Lannister's ancestral home Casterly Rock. Tywin angrily refuses and threatens to hang Shae if she is found in his bed again, but does have Tyrion named as Master of Coin, the treasurer. He also forces Tyrion to marry Sansa Stark against his will, though both decide not to consummate the marriage. Tyrion and Sansa begin to bond as they are both outcasts in King's Landing, until Sansa discovers that her mother Catelyn and brother Robb have been murdered as a result of Tywin's scheming. =Season 4= In March 2014, Dinklage confirmed that Season 4 would \\"stick fairly closely\\" to Tyrion's plot line in A Storm of Swords, adding that \\"those reversals of fortune really send [Tyrion] down the rabbit hole.\\" He notes that the character changes in Season 4, and \\"really ends up in a different place than he thought he was going to. It's fueled a bit by anger towards his family, and trying to find his place in the world. You see that some people rely on drunk, funny Tyrion. I think funny and drunk lasts only so long. He sobers up in many ways. And love is in his life [with Shae], and that causes a tremendous amount of damage – because he's vulnerable and he doesn't like to be vulnerable. He's completely stripped of his defense mechanisms.\\" Of Tyrion's relationship with his brother Jaime, Dinklage said, \\"If you're raised together, you have an unspoken dialogue many times, and it's very easy, especially between Jaime and Tyrion. They have a real friendship, a good brotherhood. They look after each other.\\" As in the novels, Tyrion is (unfairly) found guilty of Joffrey's murder and condemned to death; the HBO series does not use the reveal that his first wife was not really a prostitute to motivate Tyrion to kill his father, and he does not lie to Jaime that he is guilty of killing Joffrey. Fearing for Shae's safety, Tyrion breaks up with her and orders her to leave for Pentos. She refuses until he calls her a whore, and declares that she cannot have his children. Joffrey is poisoned to death at his wedding feast, and Cersei immediately accuses Tyrion. At his trial, Shae appears to testify against him, falsely claiming that Sansa refused to bed Tyrion unless he killed Joffrey. Outraged at her betrayal and finally snapping from years of mockery for his dwarfism, Tyrion demands a trial by combat but only after a very intense monologue about the people he hates/despises and the state of affairs. Cersei names the virtually undefeatable Gregor Clegane as her champion. Tyrion is defended by Oberyn Martell, who believes that his sister, niece, and nephew were murdered by Gregor. Oberyn is nearly victorious, but his refusal to kill Gregor without obtaining a confession gives Gregor the opportunity to kill him, and Tyrion is sentenced to death. Before his execution, Tyrion is released by Jaime to be smuggled out of Westeros by Varys. Tyrion decides to confront Tywin before his flight, and finds Shae in his father's bed. Tyrion strangles her to death, and then confronts Tywin on the privy. Tyrion kills his father with a crossbow bolt, and then leaves for Pentos with Varys. =Season 5= In 2015, James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly called Tyrion's meeting with Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) an \\"iconic meetup\\" that \\"delighted fans, who were universally enthusiastic (for once!) about the showrunners making a narrative move not yet found in George R.R. Martin’s novels.\\" Dinklage said in the interview, \\"That’s the great thing about my character: He’s been everywhere. He’s the only character that goes searching. He’s been to The Wall and now he has to find the dragons.\\" Benioff and Weiss said that the conversation between Tyrion and Daenerys focused on the parallels between their lives, as Tyrion had a \\"lot of empathy\\" toward Daenerys for being an orphan, like himself, and both had \\"terrible fathers\\". Tyrion realized that Varys might be right about Daenerys being the \\"last hope for Westeros\\". Benioff and Weiss also suggested that Tyrion believes that Daenerys could bring him \\"back into power\\". Tyrion arrives in Pentos, where Varys reveals that he has been conspiring to restore House Targaryen to power, and asks Tyrion to journey with him to meet Daenerys Targaryen in Meereen. During their journey, Tyrion is kidnapped by Daenerys' former advisor Jorah Mormont, who aims to redeem himself to Daenerys by bringing her the dwarf. However, Tyrion and Jorah are captured by slavers, whom Tyrion convinces to sell them to the fighting pits in Meereen. During a demonstration of pit fighters, Tyrion and Jorah encounter Daenerys; she decides to take Tyrion into her service, but orders Jorah exiled again. At the re-opening of Meereen's fighting pits, the insurgency known as the Sons of the Harpy launch a massive attack, which is only thwarted when Daenerys' dragon Drogon appears and scares off the Sons, before riding off with Daenerys on his back. Although Tyrion wishes to join Jorah and Daario Naharis in their search for Daenerys, Daario points out that his skills are best suited to governing Meereen in Daenerys' absence. Varys later arrives in Meereen, and offers Tyrion the use of his spy network to maintain order in the city. =Season 6= Tyrion discovers that the Sons of the Harpy are funded by the slavers of Yunkai, Astapor, and Volantis, and arranges a meeting with representatives of those cities to give them seven years to abolish slavery. Despite Tyrion's insistence that compromise is necessary, this solution is met with disapproval by Daenerys' other advisors and the freedmen of Meereen. Tyrion also enlists the assistance of the red priestess Kinvara, who believes that Daenerys is a messianic figure prophesied by her faith and offers the support of the followers of R'hllor. Meereen begins to prosper, but the city's success attracts the ire of the slavers, who fear it will undermine the legitimacy of slavery, and so launch a massive naval attack against the city. Daenerys returns in the chaos, and though she is displeased with Tyrion's failure, she is persuaded by him to obliterate the slavers' fleet and force their ultimate surrender rather than destroy them outright. Soon after, Theon and Yara Greyjoy arrive in Meereen offering Daenerys the Iron Fleet; they are joined by the fleets of Dorne and the Reach, who have defected from the Lannisters. Daenerys names an honored Tyrion as her Hand of the Queen. Tyrion then joins her, the dragons, and her army as they sail to Westeros. =Season 7= Plotting their conquest of Westeros from Dragonstone, the ancestral Targaryen fortress, Daenerys and Tyrion learn that Jon Snow has been named King in the North. Tyrion suggests that Jon would make a valuable ally; Daenerys and Jon are impressed with each other, but she is annoyed when he declines to swear his allegiance to her. Daenerys and her allies discuss their strategy for the war against the Lannisters. Tyrion advises against a direct attack on King's Landing, and Daenerys agrees to his nuanced series of attacks. However, Cersei and Jaime outmaneuver him, neutralizing Daenerys' Tyrell and Dornish support. A furious Daenerys ignores Tyrion's continued arguments for caution, and decimates a Lannister caravan with her dragons. He is also unable to stop her from executing Randyll and Dickon Tarly, who refuse to swear fealty to her even after their defeat. In \\"Eastwatch\\", Tyrion meets with Jaime in secret to broker a meeting between Cersei and Daenerys. In \\"The Dragon and the Wolf\\", he helps convince Cersei that the advancing undead are a more immediate threat than the war with Daenerys for control of Westeros. =Season 8= Tyrion returns to Winterfell with the Targaryen forces. He is reunited with Sansa, who doubts Cersei's promise to send aid and is disappointed that Tyrion would fall for Cersei's lie. Jaime later arrives in Winterfell and provides confirmation that no Lannister forces are coming. Daenerys questions Tyrion's ability to serve as her Hand after so many mistakes in judgment, but after talking to Jorah privately, she acknowledges that Tyrion is useful to her, and orders him down in the crypts during the battle against the dead for his own safety, to his chagrin. During the battle, the Night King reanimates the Starks buried in the crypts; Tyrion and Sansa hide together, prepared to face the horde, but soon the Night King is killed and the Army of the Dead destroyed. While preparing to travel south to besiege King's Landing, Tyrion learns from Sansa of Jon's heritage as a trueborn Targaryen. He tells Varys, who considers whether Jon is a better option to rule Westeros than Daenerys. Tyrion recommits to Daenerys and reveals Varys' treachery, and Daenerys executes Varys. Tyrion convinces Daenerys to halt the destruction of King's Landing if the people surrender, signalled by the ringing of the city's bells. Tyrion releases Jaime, who has been captured attempting to sneak into King's Landing, and sends him to convince Cersei to surrender rather than face Daenerys' wrath. Though the city surrenders, Tyrion is horrified when Daenerys uses Drogon to burn the city, destroy the Red Keep, and slaughter the population. Following the battle, Tyrion wanders through the ruins of King's Landing and eventually discovers the corpses of Jaime and Cersei, crushed by rubble in the Red Keep. After the victorious Daenerys promises to take her armies on a campaign of \\"liberation\\" throughout the world, she accuses Tyrion of treason for releasing Jaime. When he resigns as Hand in protest, she has him arrested and sentences him to death. In prison, Tyrion persuades Jon that he must kill Daenerys for the good of the realm. Jon hesitates but eventually does kill Daenerys, and is also imprisoned. Some time later, Tyrion (still held prisoner of Grey Worm and the Unsullied) persuades a council of the most powerful lords and ladies of Westeros to reject coronation by birthright and to instead agree to select each new ruler by council vote. He then suggests they make Bran king, claiming Bran's supernatural knowledge and wisdom make him an unparalleled choice to lead Westeros. The council votes unanimously in favor. Bran accepts the position and names Tyrion as his Hand of the King, remarking that the appointment is intended to force Tyrion to make amends for his mistakes. Tyrion passes on to Jon the news that he is to be exiled to the Night's Watch again, and bids him farewell. Some time later, he presides over King Bran's first small council meeting. Appearances in other media In 2019, Peter Dinklage and Lena Headey appeared as Tyrion and Cersei Lannister alongside Elmo in a Sesame Street PSA on the importance of being respectful to one another, as part of Sesame Street's \\"Respect Brings Us Together\\" campaign. Recognition and awards Peter Dinklage is the series's most successful cast member in terms of awards, having won 7 awards and received 37 additional nominations Dinklage's performance was praised; The Boston Globe called his Tyrion one of the show's \\"highlights\\", adding that Dinklage \\"gives a winning performance that is charming, morally ambiguous, and self-aware.\\" Matt Roush of TV Guide told viewers to \\"rejoice in the scene-stealing bravado of Peter Dinklage as the wry 'imp' Tyrion Lannister.\\" The Los Angeles Times wrote \\"In many ways, Game of Thrones belongs to Dinklage\\" even before, in Season 2, the \\"scene-stealing actor's\\" character became the series' most central figure. The New York Times noted that as beloved as the character of Tyrion is to the novels' fans, \\"Dinklage's sly performance has made Tyrion all the more popular.\\" The Huffington Post called Tyrion the \\"most quotable\\" character on the HBO series, as well as one of the most beloved. In April 2011 both the Los Angeles Times and Entertainment Weekly pronounced Dinklage worthy of an Emmy Award for his performance in Season 1. He subsequently received one for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, as well as a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Miniseries, or Television Film. He also earned a Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Miniseries or Television Film and a Scream Award for Best Supporting Actor for Season 1 of Game of Thrones.

Merchandising Among the various lines of Game of Thrones collectible figurines licensed by HBO, Tyrion has featured prominently, being dubbed one of the \\"heavy hitters\\", \\"fan favorites\\", \\"most- liked\\" and \\"most popular\\" characters. Funko has produced two Tyrion figures as part of their POP! Television line. They are 4.5 inch vinyl figures in the Japanese super deformed style, one in an early series look, and a post-Season 2 version with a facial scar, \\"Battle Armor\\" and an axe.

Plot An uncle (Thurston Harris) decides to play a practical joke on his nephew (Gertie Potter) at dinner, adding large amounts of pepper to the nephew's food, prompting an uncontrollable outburst of sneezing. In revenge, the nephew puts pepper on several items in his uncle's bedroom, so that when the uncle gets dressed the following morning, the pepper causes a violent sneezing fit, which shakes the room and knocks over the bed. The pepper continues to have an effect on the uncle during the day, as his sneezing causes damage to a few shops. The shopkeepers and other onlookers start chasing the uncle, who runs to a policeman to ask for help. Before he can request assistance, the uncle sneezes violently again, which knocks over the policeman and a lamppost, as well as causing damage to a house. In an attempt to escape the crowd that is pursuing him, the uncle climbs up a ladder, but this breaks when he sneezes again. The uncle's sneezing continues to get worse, with one sneeze causing the world to shake. Eventually a final sneeze causes the uncle to explode. Production The film contains a number of primitive special effects, including the use of wires to move objects when the uncle sneezes, and the balancing of the camera on a rocking board to give the impression that the world is swaying in the penultimate shot. The dramatic final scene, in which the uncle explodes, was achieved by stopping the camera and replacing the actor with a small smoke-emitting device.

Only one was constructed. Development The N1 Sala was designed by Guglielmo Negri and built by Fratelli Sala, whose main occupation was the production of wooden propellers for the military. It was a high-wing monoplane, its two part, two spar wing supported centrally on a fuselage pedestal and braced on each side with a pair of parallel wooden faired struts from the spars at about 20% span to the lower fuselage. It was mounted without dihedral and in plan had a rectangular centre section out to about quarter span inboard of long, strongly straight tapered, round tipped outer panels with trailing edges almost entirely filled by the ailerons. The high aspect ratio (21:1) wing was completely fabric covered. The Sala had a plywood covered, ovoid section fuselage with an open cockpit immediately ahead of the wing pedestal. The cockpit lacked a windscreen but was well instrumented for a glider of the day, with air speed indicator, altimeter, turn and bank indicator and variometer. The fuselage tapered rearwards to the tail where the tailplane, with a straight, swept leading edge and carrying elliptically shaped, aerodynamically balanced elevators, was mounted on top. The fin was no more than a mounting for the tall, curved, balanced rudder, which extended down to the keel and moved in an elevator cut-out. The standard glider ash skid, running from just aft of the nose to below the wing trailing edge and with a single rubber shock absorber served as an undercarriage, assisted by a very small tail skid. Some authors have suggested the N1 dates from 1937 but reconstructed pre-war Italian civil registers have a May 1933 registration date for I-ABEY, the sole example, based at Milan-Taliedo.

His best-known film is Rescued by Rover (1905). Other directing credits include That Fatal Sneeze (1907), The Man and his Bottle (1908) and A New Hat for Nothing (1910). In total, he directed around 400 films.Obituary in The Times, MR LEWIN FITZHAMON, EARLY BRITISH FILMS, October 11, 1961, p.15 Early career Lewis Henry Dell Fitzhamon was born on 5 June 1869, the son of the Rector of Aldingham. He received his early education at Rossall School but was forced to receive home tuition when, having contracted diphtheria and rheumatic fever, he was unable to return to school. Fitzhamon began his career as a music hall performer. He became involved in filmmaking in 1900, working with film pioneer Robert W. Paul. He gained experience in both directing and acting, with credits in films such as Briton vs. Boer (1900). Career with Hepworth Cecil Hepworth recruited Fitzhamon as a stage manager in 1904, to replace Percy Stow, who had left to establish his own film company, Clarendon. Fitzhamon continued working with Hepworth until 1912, gaining writing, acting and directing credits. One of his most popular films was Rescued by Rover (1905). Fitzhamon loved animals, producing many other films with an animal in a heroic role, such as Dog Outwits the Kidnappers and Dumb Sagacity. Fitzhamon, like Hepworth, had an interest in special effects, producing many \\"trick films\\", including Sister Mary Jane's Top Note (1907) and The Man and his Bottle (1908). Luke McKernan has described how many of his films had \\"no concern except to get the central trick effect or plot idea across, but their very lack of pretension makes for pleasurable viewing now\\". He had a wide and varied output, covering westerns, fantasy films, comedies, chase films and melodramas. Later career In 1912, Fitzhamon established his own film company, Fitz Films. He also worked as a freelance director, for various producers. He published two novels: The Rival Millionaires (1904) and The Vixen (1915).

Establishment On 30 September 1955 the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan passed the Establishment of West Pakistan Act, 1955. By Section 7 of the Establishment of West Pakistan Act, 1955, the Governor-General of Pakistan was invested with the power to establish, by Order, a High Court for the Province of West Pakistan to replace the Lahore High Court. The High Court of West Pakistan (Establishment) Order XIX of 1955, (which came into force on 14 October 1955) established the legal foundation for the High Court of West Pakistan and provided for various matters in relation to its jurisdiction and powers. The Order inter alia provided that the new High Court of West Pakistan would have such Original, Appellate and other jurisdiction and such powers and authority in respect of the territories included in the Province of West Pakistan as the High Court of Judicature at Lahore had immediately before the commencement of that Order. Appointment of Judges By virtue of Article 6 of the High Court of West Pakistan (Establishment) Order, 1955, read with Section 7 of the Establishment of West Pakistan Act, 1955, Judges of the Chief Court of Sind and the Judicial Commissioners' Court at Peshawar became Judges of the High Court of West Pakistan, entitled to terms and conditions of service, not less favourable than those to which they were entitled as Judge of the High Courts from which they were transferred. Persons who were immediately before the date of the establishment of the High Court of West Pakistan serving as temporary or additional Judges became, on the interacting day, temporary or additional Judges, as the case may be of the High Court of West Pakistan. Functioning The 1956 Constitution provided for a High Court for each of the two Provinces and declared that the existing High Court for the Provinces of East Bengal and West Pakistan functioning before the Constitution Day would be deemed to be High Courts, under the Constitution, for the Provinces of East Pakistan and West Pakistan respectively. Under the Constitution, both the Provincial High Courts retained the jurisdiction and powers as were exercisable by them immediately before the Constitution Day. Likewise, persons holding office as Chief Justice and Judges of the two Provincial High Courts, continued to retain their offices on the same terms and conditions as to remuneration and other privileges as were applicable to them immediately before the Constitution Day. As previously provided in the Government of India Act 1935, the new Constitution declared the two Provincial High Courts to be Courts of Record and provided for the appointment of permanent and acting judges by the President of Pakistan (instead of the Governor-General), for their holding of the office during good behaviour and for their retirement at the age of 60. Unfortunately, the new Constitution did not provide for the appointment of temporary additional judges to any of the two High Courts. The qualification for appointment of persons as Judges of the said High Courts were altered. Pakistani Citizenship was made a pre-requisite. The bifurcation previously created between barristers and pleaders was removed and both were grouped into one compartment for eligibility, namely, advocates or defendants having at least ten years' standing in both or either of High Courts. The qualifying period of five years service previously laid down for persons holding judicial officers in British India not inferior to that of a subordinated Judge, or judge of a Small Cause Court, was raised to ten, but the enumeration describing the two particular types of judicial offices to be held was removed. The appointment of all judges by the President was made conditional on the President first seeking advice from the Chief Justice of Pakistan, the Governor General of Province to which the appointment related and where the appointment was out that of the Province to which the appointment related and where the appointment was not that of the Chief Justice, the Chief Justice of the High Court of that Province. The Constitution also gave the President the power to transfer a Judges of a High Court from one High Court to the other High Court after securing the Judges's consent and after consultation with the Chief Justice of Pakistan and the Chief Justice of the Court of which the proposed transferee was a Judge. Jurisdiction The two High Courts were given power, throughout the territories in which they exercised jurisdiction, to issue to any person or authority (including the government directions, orders or writs (including writs in the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari) for the enforcement of all or any of the Fundamental Rights contained in Part II of the Constitution and for any other purpose generally.

In total, Fifth Street stretches approximately one mile (fifteen blocks) along a southwest-to-northeast axis between the John Lynch Bridge (crossing the James River) to the northeast and the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Bridge to the southwest, which spans a valley containing the Norfolk Southern Railroad main line. Fifth Street is currently designated as State Route 163, although it served as U.S. Route 170 from 1926 to 1931. From 1931 until 2005, Fifth Street was part of U.S. 29, which connects Maryland to Florida. In October 2005, a new bypass that circumnavigated the eastern edge of Lynchburg and Madison Heights (Amherst County) was completed and Fifth Street (the U.S. 29 Business) was re-designated as State Route 163. As Fifth Street crosses the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Bridge to the southwest, the name of the street changes to Memorial Avenue. On the northeast, the name of the route changes to South Amherst Highway as it crosses the John Lynch Bridge and enters Amherst County. Fifth Street and Memorial Avenue have been given the honorary designation as Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard. The primary cross street within the district is Federal Street, which intersects Fifth Street at its 700-800 block transition. Like all streets crossing Fifth (except Park Avenue), Federal Street intersects at a right angle, and runs in a southeast-to-northwest direction. On its southeastern end, Federal Street terminates in its 1100 block due to a steep cliff that overlooks Twelfth Street. On its northwestern end, Federal Street transitions into Hollins Mill Road, a winding route that crosses Blackwater Creek and terminates at its intersection with Bedford Avenue. The intersection of Fifth and Federal is marked by a single-lane, four-way roundabout and adjoining pedestrian plazas, which were completed in 2010. At Fifth Street's transition between the 1000 and 1100 blocks, it intersects with Monroe Street as well as Park Avenue. Park Avenue departs Fifth Street at a 90-degree angle, and runs due south as it climbs College Hill before turning southwest toward the Kemper Street train station, which is served by four daily Amtrak trains. Just northeast of the Fifth Street Historic District is the intersection of Fifth Street, Church Street (one-way southeast-bound) and Main Street (one-way northwest-bound). Just northwest of Fifth Street, Main and Church converge and form Rivermont Avenue at the Rivermont Bridge, which spans a deep gorge formed by Blackwater Creek. Other streets (all neighborhood-serving) that intersect Fifth Street in the district are Court, Clay, Madison, Harrison, Jackson, and Polk Streets. An unnamed tributary of Blackwater Creek drains the Tinbridge Hill neighborhood to the northwest, and the headwaters of Horseford Creek (now underground in pipes) runs in a southeasterly direction from the east side of the district, and eventually enters the James River via a culvert at the bottom of Washington Street. The district's topography is largely flat, particularly between the 600 and 900 blocks of the route. Northeast of the 600 block, Fifth Street begins a precipitous 12 percent grade that carries the roadway downward towards the James River. The highest elevation within the district along Fifth Street is 765 feet above sea level in the 1100 block, and its lowest elevation is 710 feet above sea level in the 700 block.  Early Development  Lynch's Ferry and the Ferry Road = Seven years after Charles Lynch's 1750 patent of 1,590 acres on both sides of the Fluvanna (James) River in what was then Albemarle County, his son Edward was granted permission to establish a ferry across the river at its confluence with Blackwater Creek. Edward's brother John, then seventeen years of age, is credited with operating the ferry from the beginning. Following the ferry's establishment, John Lynch constructed a tavern known as the \\"Ferry House\\" at the base of what would become known as Ninth Street. in order to accommodate travelers who might need to halt at the south side of the river to wait for the appropriate time of day or weather conditions to utilize the ferry. Prior to the development of the ferry, the river was crossed via a ford (the \\"Horse Ford\\") at the head of what is now known as Percival's Island, which, of course, was reached by roads from the north and south. In 1781, Thomas Jefferson noted that recently-mined lead and other goods could be brought from the southwest along this \\"good road… [which led] through the peaks of Otter to Lynch's ferry, or Winston's, on James river [sic].\\" As it neared Lynch's Ferry on the south side of the river, this road established the path that would become the Fifth Street corridor. The \\"Ferry Road\\" was later described as a \\"well-shaded road [that] led from the ferry, …coming up Seventh Street to Main, passing through the square [block] between Seventh and Sixth to Church, …and obliquely thence into what is now Fifth Street, on its way to New London.\\" = Establishment of Lynchburg = In 1786, the General Assembly adopted an act to establish a town called \\"Lynchburg\\" on the land of John Lynch. Initially containing 45 acres, it would be divided into two-acre blocks, each with four half-acre lots with 165' frontages on the 60' wide streets (the roads that paralleled the James River) and 132' frontages on the 30' wide alleys (those roads that ran perpendicular to the river). In its beginning, there were only four alleys in the town, the westernmost one being designated as \\"Third Alley\\" (now Seventh Street). By 1796, Lynchburg contained approximately one hundred houses and was \\"rapidly increasing, from its advantageous situation for carrying on trade with the adjacent country\\" according to Isaac Weld's travelogue. In 1805, Lynchburg was officially incorporated, and the town was expanded to the northwest and southeast, although this expansion simply made formal what John Lynch had already accomplished three years earlier; in 1802, he sold thirty half-acre lots in this soon-to-be-annexed area, which meant that the formal plan of the annexed area was already in place by the time of its expansion in 1805. Seventh Alley (later known as Fifth Street) and Sixth Alley (later known as Twelfth Street) became the primary routes of access into the town. = Early 19th Century Expansion = In March 1806, John and Mary Lynch gave the Town of Lynchburg a one acre lot \\"on a hill on the west side of the Main Road leading from the upper side of Lynchburg toward New London\\" for use as a public burying ground. The \\"Main Road\\" that Lynch described was a combination of Fifth Street (then designated as Seventh Alley) and what is now known as Park Avenue. The burying ground, now known as the Old City Cemetery, was sited on the outskirts of town, but not so distant as to be inconvenient to residents. With Lynchburg's primary business district along Second Street (now Main) at its north end, and the town's public cemetery at its south end, what is now recognized as the Fifth Street Corridor was in place by 1806. By this time, Fifth Street also became known alternately as Cocke Street or West Street. The name \\"Cocke\\" likely originated with merchant Thomas W. Cocke, who owned property along the route in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. During the following two decades, the corporate limits of Lynchburg would expand several times, increasing the number of lots along the Fifth Street corridor that were included in the town. In 1814, the town limits were expanded to Seventh Street (now known as Harrison Street). Following the 1826 annexation, the majority of the Fifth Street corridor was within the town limits. As the town expanded, the established design of lots, streets, and alleys also expanded. Typically, the half-acre lots were already in private hands (i.e. sold by John Lynch to other individuals) by the time they were incorporated into the town, and the future streets and alleys were accounted for in the deed. An 1805 deed between John Lynch and Peter Detto for a half acre lot at the corner of Fourth Street (now Court) and Seventh Alley (now Fifth) ordered Detto to reserve a thirty- foot alley, while an 1812 deed between Lynch and his niece Agatha Terrell Dicks described the lot as being located at the corner of the \\"contemplated Seventh [Harrison] Street and Third Alley [Seventh Street].\\" As in many Virginia towns of the period, Lynchburg residents were required to construct on each lot a \\"dwelling house sixteen feet square at least, with a brick or stone chimney.\\" Unlike other towns, however, Lynchburgers were not directed to construct their homes of any particular material, and thus, many chose wood, which was the least expensive and most readily available material. Frame dwellings were typical in Virginia, much to the consternation of Thomas Jefferson, who noted that it was \\"impossible to devise things more ugly, uncomfortable, and happily more perishable.\\" While the majority of the first dwellings constructed in Lynchburg were frame, most are no longer extant, which seems to correlate to Jefferson's comment concerning the perishability of frame buildings in Virginia. By the second decade of the 19th century, Lynchburg was experiencing its first building boom, and many of the city's buildings began to be constructed of brick.  Federal Period Taverns, Stores & Houses  Kentucky Hotel = Kentucky HotelTwo of Lynchburg's three extant taverns from the early nineteenth century are located in the Fifth Street Historic District. The left-hand three-bay section of the Kentucky Hotel (118-0177) at 900 Fifth Street may have been built as early as 1800, while the two right-hand bays were added circa 1814. Typical for Lynchburg residential architecture of the period, the Kentucky Hotel presents a five-bay façade built of brick laid in Flemish bond. The façade is fenestrated by 6/9 double-hung sash on the first floor and 6/6 double-hung sash on the second floor. A single-leaf entry door topped by a graceful fanlight is located in the central bay of the first floor, and the single-pile, side-gable building is flanked by a pair of single-shouldered corbeled chimneys (the corbeling is a recent addition or reconstruction). While the majority of Lynchburg's buildings of this period feature a wooden box cornice, the Kentucky Hotel (along with other Fifth Street buildings) has a cornice of corbeled brick. =Western Hotel/Nichols' Tavern = Nichols Tavern/Western HotelThe second tavern along the corridor is known alternately as Nichols' Tavern or the Western Hotel (118-0020) and is sited at 600 Fifth Street. Built in 1815, the tavern is a replacement of Nichols' previous building that burned on April 14, 1815. The building's orientation toward the street is somewhat complex, as it may have begun its life with its asymmetrical five-bay elevation along Madison Street serving as the primary entrance. This elevation is now fenestrated by large-paned 6/6 double-hung sash on the first floor (these likely began as 9/9 sash) and 6/9 double-hung sash on the second floor. A double-leaf entry door with a fanlight similar to that found at the Kentucky Hotel occupies the central bay on the first floor, and is sheltered by a small, hipped-roof porch, which is a late 20th-century addition. However, this section of the building also would have presented a much denser three-bay façade along Fifth Street. This elevation is also fenestrated by large-paned 6/6 sash on the first floor and 6/9 double-hung sash on the second floor. The left-hand window on the first floor rests above a wooden panel, and may have once served as a doorway. Another apparent doorway in the central bay has been bricked-in. In all likelihood, the original section of the tavern had entrances on both street elevations in order to best accommodate the traveling public. This original section of the building is constructed of brick laid in four-course American bond and is covered by a hipped roof of standing-seam metal. The building was expanded in the 1830s or 1840s, and the remainder of the Fifth Street elevation took shape at that time with the addition of two bays to the south along with a columned portico. = Other Commercial Buildings = Two smaller resources from the early nineteenth century are also found along the 600 and 700 blocks of Fifth Street. The frame building at 708 Fifth Street (118-5318-0027) was likely built by prominent Lynchburg merchant Archibald Robertson (1783-1835) circa 1820. Perhaps the only intact example of frame commercial architecture from the period remaining in Lynchburg, the building presents a tight, three-bay façade along Fifth Street (while most of the façade is currently covered by T-111 siding and a later brick storefront, interior investigation reveals the building's true nature). The two-story, double-pile (the rear chimney has been removed below the roofline) building is of timber frame construction, and is covered by a side gable roof of standing- seam metal with a simple boxed cornice. While the first floor storefront has been remodeled by the addition of a brick façade and aluminum and glass commercial door, the second floor (underneath the T-111 siding) retains its original fenestration with a single-leaf doorway with a four-pane transom, which once opened onto an overhanging balcony, flanked by a pair of 6/6 double-hung sash. The building's balcony was likely in place through the first quarter of the 20th century, and is a reminder of a once-common architectural feature on Fifth Street that has completely disappeared from the district. The 1895 Sanborn Insurance Company map of the area shows that at least 13 buildings along the 600 and 700 blocks of Fifth Street had some sort of balcony, porch, or awning that overhung Fifth Street. This scene may have been captured by German-born artist Bernhard Gutmann (1869-1936), who, in 1895, sketched what he called \\"Negro Street\\" in Lynchburg. This image shows more than half a dozen two- or two-and–a-half-story buildings with steeply-pitched side-gable roofs, end chimneys, narrow two- and three-bay facades, and shallow two-story covered porches. While not definitively a sketch of Fifth Street, it is highly likely that Gutmann was depicting a streetscape along the 600 or 700 block of the corridor. The two-and-a-half-story building at 612 Fifth Street (118-5318-0018) is another rare surviving example of early 19th century residential or commercial architecture (during this period, there is little stylistic distinction between buildings for residential use versus commercial use) in Lynchburg. While not the first building to stand on the site, the present building was likely built in 1827 by Lilbourn Johnson. A three-bay, double pile building (the rear interior end chimney has been removed), 612 Fifth Street is of brick construction with kneelered (parapeted) gables capped by half-round brick coping, a feature rarely found in Lynchburg. While the façade has been covered by a modern layer of running bond brick, the building's early 19th century roots can be clearly discerned. = Houses of the Federal Period = Lastly, a cluster of Federal period dwellings is located just off of the main thoroughfare near Sixth Street's intersections with Federal, Jackson, and Polk Streets. Perhaps the largest extant frame house of the period in Lynchburg, the c. 1817 Augustine Leftwich House (118-5318-0062) is a five-bay, double-pile L-shaped dwelling covered by a hipped roof with dormers. Altered over time, the façade is fenestrated by 2/2 double-hung sash, and a second floor doorway opens onto a balcony created by a three-bay porch that shelters the entry door on the first floor. The house retains what appears to be an original outbuilding that is covered by a hipped roof with a dentiled cornice. The house at 523 Jackson Street (118-5318-0037) is a now-rare Lynchburg example of a three-bay frame house of the Federal period. Probably built by James Mallory (owner of the nearby Kentucky Hotel) in 1814, the house is one of five remaining three-bay frame houses dating to the second decade of the 19th century in Lynchburg (the other four may be found nearby, but outside of the Fifth Street district, in the 1000 and 1100 blocks of Jackson Street, 1100 block of Polk Street, and on Lucado Place). The two-story, side-hall plan house rests on a high stone English basement, and features an original shed-roofed, one-story back porch of a type known to locals of the period as a \\"shelving porch.\\" Directly across the street at 522 Jackson (118-5318-0036) is a somewhat unusual four-bay, -story house. Constructed in 1817, the brick building is laid in three-course American bond, which is not often found as a bond on primary elevations of Lynchburg houses (the nearby c. 1813 Dicks-Elliott House [118-5063] also features this bond throughout), and is atypically fenestrated by 6/6 double-hung sash on the first floor with 9/9 double-hung sash on the second floor. Nearby at 911 Sixth Street is a mirror image of the house at 522 Jackson. Also constructed in 1817, the William Phaup House (118-0226-0246) also displays a four-bay façade, but the entry door is located in the left center bay instead of the right center bay. The brick dwelling is laid in Flemish bond on the façade, with variable three and four-course American bond on the gable ends. Like 522 Jackson, the Phaup House exhibits the stylistic faux-pas (in Adamesque terms) of not diminishing the size of the windows on upper floors. The facade is fenestrated by 6/9 double-hung sash on both the first and second levels, and as late as the 1980s, contained a second floor entry door as well (now replaced by a window) and a small two-story porch (this may not have been an original feature). Rounding out the Fifth Street Historic District's collection of early buildings is the two-and-a-half-story brick house at 514 Polk Street (118-5318-0046), which, like 911 Sixth Street, was likely built as a speculative investment by William Phaup as early as 1817. However, this is where the similarities between the two Phaup houses end. The house at 514 Polk Street began as a two-bay building, and the right bay was added soon after to create the present widely-spaced three-bay façade, which is laid in Flemish bond. As a cost-saving measure, secondary elevations are laid in five-course American bond. Like the building at 612 Fifth Street, this house features a kneelered (parapeted) gable roof. The left (original) kneeler is capped by coping of half-round bricks, while the right kneeler is flat. Windows on the first floor are 9/1 double-hung sash, and are 6/1 double-hung sash on the second floor.  Mid 19th Century Tobacco Factories  Gist Tobacco FactoryThe next significant cluster of buildings in the district can be found in the 400 block of Court Street, and are representative of the tobacco factories that were ubiquitous in Lynchburg throughout the 19th century. Both constructed between 1877 and 1885, the tobacco factories at 409 Court Street (118-5318-0001) and 410 Court Street (118-0075) are the largest contributing buildings within the Fifth Street Historic District. The gable front of the two-and-a-half-story building at 409 Court Street is built of oiled brick laid in running bond, while the sides of the factory are laid with a more rustic brick in the five-course American bond pattern. The building at 410 Court Street, which also presents its gable end on Court Street as the primary elevation, is a three-and-a-half-story building that rests on a high basement. The entire factory is built of brick, and the original portion is largely five-course American bond. On both buildings, virtually all ornamentation is reserved for the upper portions of the gable ends that front onto Court Street.  Early 20th Century Commercial Buildings  Humbles BuildingAround 1900, many frame buildings along Fifth Street, both residential and commercial, began to be replaced with more substantial brick commercial buildings. Constructed in 1906, the one-story building at 500 Fifth Street (118-5318-0007) featured two storefronts, each framed by vertical brick quoining and horizontal brick panels. One of the first two-story brick commercial buildings to be constructed along Fifth Street during this period, the right-hand section of 701-703 Fifth Street (118-5318-0024) was in place by 1907. The three-bay, two-part commercial block building has a storefront that wraps around the corner onto Harrison Street, and is topped by a corbeled brick cornice with a moulded tin cap. The left-hand portion (numbered 703 Fifth Street), also a three-bay building, was added soon after 1907, and mimics the design of its mate. Also a two-story, two-part commercial block building, 606 Fifth Street (118-5318-0016) consists of two halves, each of which are three bays wide. The building's brickwork is somewhat unusual for the area, as the six-course American bond is separated by rowlock, rather than header, brick. Built in 1915, the Humbles Building at 901 Fifth Street (118-5318-0039) is an impressive three-story, two-part commercial block edifice faced with yellow brick laid in a running bond on the Fifth and Jackson Street elevations. The upper windows are capped by a row of soldier bricks, and the storefront area is framed by a series of soldier and rowlock bricks. The M.R. Scott Meat Market (118-5318-0023) at 700 Fifth Street is one of the most architecturally refined buildings along Fifth Street. Designed by Lynchburg architects Samuel Preston Craighill and Bennett Cardwell in 1919, the one-story building features the name \\"M.R. Scott\\" engraved on a panel of Vermont white marble, and squares of \\"antique verde marble\\" accent the area above the storefront. The storefront is dominated by brick pilasters with cement caps, and a recessed panel of basket-woven brick spans the top of the façade. The three-story, three-bay, two-part commercial block building at 709 Fifth Street (118-5318-0028) features brick quoining on the upper two stories, which are visually separated by a series of three stuccoed diamond panels. The windows on the upper two levels of the circa 1936 building are capped by brick splayed jackarches with cement keystones.  Automobile-oriented Buildings  One of the first automobile-oriented buildings in the district was built in 1927 for the Miller Tire and Battery Company (118-5317) at 400 Fifth Street. The original portion (first floor) of the building is constructed of hard-fired rusticated brick. The most unusual feature of the building was a diagonal porte-cochere on its north corner that allowed drivers to stop at the building, visit the business office, and perhaps check their tire pressure without being exposed to the elements. This pass-through was supported on its extreme northern corner by a single brick pillar. In the 1940s, the porte- cochere was infilled, and a second story was added to the building. Pyramid MotorsThe Adams Motor Company building at 811 Fifth Street (118-5318-0034) was also built in 1927 and spans half of the block; it has one of the largest footprints of any building in the district. Originally constructed to house showrooms for three separate car retailers, the Flemish bond brick façade is divided into three sections, each containing three large storefront windows (except for the central bay of the right-hand section, which contains a garage door). The façade is dominated by large arched glazed fanlights with tracery (now covered with a dryvit-like material), which top each of the nine windows or garage doors. The district's second mammoth automobile showroom, Pyramid Motors (118-5237), was built in 1937 and is located at 407 Federal Street. The one-story Art Deco-style building features a yellow brick façade with contrasting red brick details. A semi-circular entry tower of corbelled yellow brick dominates the center of the façade and rises above the building's flat roof. The district also features two smaller, later automobile or auto parts retail buildings. Built in 1951 for Hoskins Pontiac, the building at 1018 Fifth Street (118-5318-0050) features a polygonal façade that is dominated by an angular metal canopy, yellow brick laid in a running bond, and polished aluminum doorframes. A service area along the Polk Street elevation is fenestrated by a short row of steel hopper windows topped by large vertical panels of thick green corrugated glass. The Burnett Tire Company building at 403 Fifth Street (118-5318-0004) was likely designed by the Lynchburg architectural firm of Cress & Johnson (Carl Cress and Stanhope S. Johnson) in 1956, and features a striking angular glass storefront that conveys a modern sense of upward movement and speed. Several early to mid-20th century service stations are also located along Fifth Street, the most notable being the eclectic Spanish Revival-style filling station at 1100 Fifth Street (118-5318-0051) at Fifth Street's key intersection with Monroe Street and Park Avenue. Built in 1927, the building follows the box-and-canopy form. Identical to the station at 1201 Rivermont Avenue (118-0334-0112), the building features a gable-front porte-cochere covered with green terra cotta tiles. A pair of globe light fixtures tops the porte-cochere's two end supporting columns.  Other notable buildings  Moser Furniture Company = A departure from other commercial buildings in the district, the Moser Furniture Company building at 409 Fifth Street (118-5318-0005) appears more domestic than commercial. The -story, single-pile Colonial Revival style building was built in 1936. A scaled-down version of a previous concept, the current building was designed in 1933 by Stanhope S. Johnson and R.O. Brannan. Displaying all of the elements of a \\"proper\\" building of the style and period, the brick store is laid in Flemish bond, features a steeply-pitched side gable roof covered with Buckingham slate with three dormers and a modillioned cornice, and two corbeled interior end chimneys flank the main building. A pair of smaller wings is set back from the primary plane of the façade, and a pair of large bay windows flanks the single-leaf entry door, which is surrounded by a pedimented frontispiece. A long, two-story warehouse and furniture factory constructed of concrete masonry units projects from the rear of the main building. = Fifth Street Baptist Church = Fifth Street Baptist ChurchThe only example of ecclesiastical architecture in the district is the Fifth Street Baptist Church at 1007-1013 Fifth Street (118-5318-0053). Built in 1929 to replace an earlier building, the church displays elements of the Gothic Revival style. The building's gable end fronts Fifth Street, and is anchored by a pair of staggered height crenelated towers (the taller, right-hand tower features a stuccoed round recessed panel at the top). The three-bay façade is built of brick laid in a running bond, and is fenestrated by arched stained glass windows. A later parish house addition is attached to the south side of the church, and was designed sympathetically to the architecture of the nave. = Community Funeral Home = What appears to be the district's most recent building, the Community Funeral Home at 909 Fifth Street (118-5318-0040) is actually a historic building with a modern shell. The right-hand portion of the building was constructed in 1922 as a two-story, two-part commercial block brick building with two storefronts separated by a doorway that led to a stairway to the second floor. The second floor façade contained an unusual central space that may have been a large window or perhaps a recessed balcony (period photographs do not clearly show this space due to shadows created by a cloth awning overhead). In 1976, Lynchburg architect J. Everette Fauber, Jr. created two design options for an upgrade and expansion of the building. The first option involved reconfiguring the left storefront of the building to include Gothic-style arched chapel windows, with a modern addition to the left (south) of the building. The second option, which is what was chosen, covered the entire façade of the historic building with a blank canvas of running bond brick, and joined to it a one-story addition with a striking, recessed angular entry. While obscuring the historic façade, Fauber's second design achieved its purpose of marrying the two buildings and creating a cohesive architectural statement. = Multi-family Residences = Lastly, two residential buildings from the mid-20th century are worthy of mention. Somewhat unusual for multifamily dwellings of the period and area, the duplex at 411-413 Polk Street is a one-story building constructed of brick laid in five-course American bond. Built in 1940, the duplex's spartan four-bay façade contains a pair of single-leaf entry doors in the two central bays, and each outer bay contains a 1/1 double-hung sash window. The doors and windows are capped by flat jackarches of soldier bricks, and a band of soldier bricks encircles the building at the water table. The building is covered by a flat roof that is obscured from view by a parapet wall that features shallow corbelling near the top. The large brick building at 600 Monroe Street, originally known as the Tal-Fred Apartments (118-5318-0059), rises two stories above Monroe Street, although the Sixth Street elevation contains three stories over a basement. Built circa 1940, the building apparently contained six relatively large apartment units. Covered by a hipped roof with vented dormer, the building's primary entrance features a single-leaf entry door flanked by sidelights and topped by a semi-elliptical fanlight. The doorway is sheltered by a wooden canopy suspended by chains. In 1949, architect Pendleton S. Clark designed interior and exterior modifications, which likely included a greenstone patio enclosed by a low brick wall with greenstone coping that is located between the building and Monroe Street.  Statement of Significance  The Fifth Street Historic District includes approximately 23 acres of commercial district and residential clusters to the southwest of Lynchburg's central business district. The district includes more than 55 contributing resources and less than 10 non-contributing resources. The Fifth Street Corridor began its development in the early nineteenth century as a gateway to Lynchburg, connecting the booming town with points westward as evidenced by transportation-oriented businesses of the period with names like the Kentucky Hotel (118-0177) and the Western Hotel (118-0020). During the late nineteenth century, Fifth Street (also known variably as Seventh Alley, Cocke Street, or West Street) served as the site of uses that would seem to be incompatible; it hosted high-end residential areas for Lynchburg's white population while at the same time serving as the principal scene of commerce for the area's African American community. \\"The Negro in Virginia,\\" (<\\\\-- this is no longer available to view \\"The Negro in Virginia\\". Please correct link for reference.) a milestone report published by the Virginia Writers' Project of the Works Progress Administration in 1940, described Lynchburg's Fifth Street along with Roanoke's Henry Street, South Avenue in Petersburg, and Second Street in Richmond, as a place where \\"the 'crowd' may be found almost every evening… here is a little oasis – 'our street.' Race pride is triumphant; here one need bow and scrape to no one. Drug stores, cafes, barbershops, pool halls, grocery and clothing stores, news-stands and theaters…are operated for Negroes by Negroes.\\" In addition to serving as the center of African American business in the twentieth century, the corridor developed as a major automobile sales and service district, serving as host to filling and service stations, tire and auto parts stores, and automobile showrooms. The Fifth Street Historic District has a period of significance ranging from 1800 to 1964, beginning with the date of construction for the oldest standing resource in the district and concluding with the end of significant commercial expansion within the boundaries of the district. It is locally significant under Criterion A in the areas of commerce and transportation for its role in the commercial and physical development of the City of Lynchburg. The Fifth Street Historic District is also locally significant under Criterion A for its role as a center of African American commerce and culture from the late nineteenth century through the mid-twentieth century. Also locally significant under Criterion C for its important collection of domestic and commercial architecture, the district boasts examples of the Federal (and early nineteenth century Virginia vernacular), early twentieth century commercial, Art Deco, Colonial Revival, and modern styles. The district displays substantial integrity of location, material, association, design, and workmanship.  Architecture  William Phaup HouseThe Fifth Street Historic District is Lynchburg's fourth historic district with a commercial or industrial theme, and exhibits an unprecedented diversity of architectural styles that provides evidence of the corridor's role as an important commercial center from the 19th through the 20th centuries. The district's collection of residential and commercial architecture dating to the Early National Period (1790-1829) is second (in Lynchburg) only to the Federal Hill Historic District (118-0056). Two of the city's three remaining taverns of the period, the Kentucky Hotel (118-0177) and Nichols Tavern (118-0020), are located on Fifth Street. Perhaps the last two of Lynchburg's early double-pile town houses (or stores) are located at 612 and 708 Fifth Street (118-5318-0018 and 118-5318-0027, respectively). In addition, the district boasts five additional dwellings that were constructed before 1820. These five houses, located just off of Fifth Street on Polk, Sixth, and Federal Streets, were constructed during Fifth Street's rise as a commercial and transportation center in the early 19th century, and are representative of similar known resources along the 300 and 900 blocks of Fifth Street that have been demolished. A sampling of the area's most progressive automobile-oriented architecture can also be found along Fifth Street, including the Colonial Revival style Adams Motor Company building at 811 Fifth Street (118-5318-0034), the Art Deco style Pyramid Motors Company building at 407 Federal Street (118-5237), and the modern style showrooms at 403 and 1101 Fifth (118-5318-0004 and 118-5318-0052, respectively).  Commercial and Transportation Corridor  In January 1805, the Virginia General Assembly adopted an act that incorporated the town of Lynchburg, thus allowing the mayor and common councilmen to become a \\"body corporate\\" which was authorized to erect public works and buildings. In addition, the act provided for the expansion of the original 1786 limits of the town, and new thoroughfares, including Seventh Alley (alleys ran perpendicular to the James River) were formalized. As the system of two-acre blocks, each containing four half-acre lots, spread westward, the winding old Ferry Road, which had provided access to Lynch's Ferry at least since 1757, was merged with Seventh Alley. Thus, travelers heading westward to the communities of New London, Liberty (now Bedford), Salem, and the Cumberland Gap would cross the James River via Lynch's Ferry (this ferry would be replaced by a toll bridge in 1812), proceed up Water Street (now Ninth Street), turn right on Second Street (now Main), and then left onto Seventh Alley (now Fifth Street). Seventh Alley headed up the long incline from the James River, crested what is now known as Court House Hill, and proceeded in a southwesterly direction, ultimately connecting with the New London Road (later designated as the Lynchburg & Salem Turnpike, or Fort Avenue). Due to the volume of traffic coming from and going to the western parts of Virginia, Seventh Alley (now known as Fifth Street) was in a prime position for commercial growth. Until circa 1805, virtually all commercial activity in Lynchburg took place along what is now known as Main Street, as well as at the bottom of what is now known as Ninth Street where the ferry (and later toll bridge) crossed the James River. Between 1797 and 1805, 13 out of 14 non-residential Lynchburg properties insured by the Mutual Assurance Society of Virginia were located on Main Street. Around this time, Seventh Alley also became known as Cocke Street, probably because merchant and civic leader Thomas W. Cocke owned at least two lots along the corridor prior to 1805. Another alternate name for the route was \\"West Street,\\" which may have originated from the surname of West, but more likely because the street was the route taken to proceed in a westerly direction. Not surprisingly, the popularity of the route as a transportation corridor also led to the construction of several taverns along Fifth Street in the second decade of the 19th century, which marked Lynchburg's first building boom (which was tempered only by the financial panic of 1819). In 1814, James Mallory purchased lot number 395 (at the corner of what is now known as Jackson and Fifth Streets) from Israel Snead. The original three-bay section of the house at 900 Fifth Street (118-0177) may have been standing at this time, and Mallory likely expanded the house to its present five-bay configuration soon after he purchased the property. Mallory's tavern would soon be known as the Kentucky Hotel, an obvious reference to the ultimate destination of many Fifth Street travelers, and was the primary landmark in the area, as an 1817 appointment of road surveyors refers to the \\"road leading by James Mallory's (called West Street).\\" Jacob Feazle purchased the tavern from Mallory in 1826 and then married Ann Cobbs, owner of 514 Polk Street (118-5318-0046), in 1829. Two years later, Jacob and Ann sold the tavern to Pleasant Partin for the respectable amount of $3,100. The Kentucky Hotel was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Joseph Nichols' Tavern (118-0020) was built in 1815 and almost immediately burned due to sparks emanating from a blacksmith shop across Fifth Street. It was rebuilt in the same year due to an outpouring of support from the community, who raised more than $1,300 to assist Mr. Nichols and his family. Joseph Nichols was an experienced tavern keeper, as he was issued his first license in 1799, although the location of his previous tavern is unknown. Joseph and Lewis Nichols operated the tavern at 600 Fifth Street through 1822. John F. Johnson operated the business from 1824 until his death in 1843, when his widow, Mary, took over. She served as the tavern keeper until 1850, when she was listed as a resident in the household of Allen J. Black, a tavern keeper. During the Johnsons' ownership, the tavern became known as the Western Hotel. The building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. In 1818, William Shaw began operating a tavern at his house (already well-known as \\"Travelers Rest\\") at the southeast corner of what is now Court and Fifth Street. In particular, Shaw catered to children, as he noted that the property was convenient to three schools. Fisher's Auto Parts Warehouse (118-5317) now occupies the site of Travelers Rest. The presence of two extant taverns dating to the early 19th century is significant, as it is thought that only three taverns from the period remain in Lynchburg (the third being Major Oliver Towles' tavern [also known as Cross Keys] at 1200-1204 Main Street). In 1816, at least 16 taverns operated in the town. Naturally, retailers began to establish themselves along Fifth Street during the same period. Peter Detto may have operated a store (or perhaps even a tavern) soon after his 1805 purchase of a lot on the southwest corner of what is now Clay and Fifth Streets. In 1818, merchant Benjamin Perkins acquired the lot at the southeast corner of Fifth and Harrison Streets and promptly sold it to Archibald Robertson, surviving partner of Brown Robertson & Co. Scottish-born merchant William Brown, who died in the Richmond Theatre Fire of 1811, had numerous mercantile connections throughout Virginia, including at Otter Bridge in Bedford County, Milton in Albemarle County, and Manchester opposite Richmond. Following Brown's death, Archibald Robertson took over a great deal of the business operation. Robertson operated several stores (including one at what is now Seventh and Main Street), and many of Lynchburg's leading citizens were his customers. Thomas Jefferson was a longstanding customer of the firm, and at the time of his death in 1826, Jefferson owed $6,000, or 6% of his total debt, to Robertson. Robertson constructed at least two buildings on the lot, and merchant Lindsay B. Padgett purchased the lot from Robertson's estate in 1844. Specializing in ready-made clothing and dry goods, Padgett operated stores on both Main Street and Cocke (Fifth Street). He owed substantial debts to many individuals and companies, and mortgaged his real and personal properties in order to secure the debts. Padgett apparently defaulted on the note, and an October 1847 Lynchburg Virginian advertisement announced the public sale of his property, including \\"all ready made clothing now in his store on Cocke Street.\\" Retail grocer James M. Cochran purchased the store building, then referred to as the \\"Red House,\\" at 708 Fifth Street (118-5318-0027) in 1849. Another early store is located at 612 Fifth Street (118-5318-0018), and was probably built by Lilbourn Johnson in 1827. The previously-mentioned merchant Lindsay Padgett purchased the building around 1839. Like Federal period taverns of Lynchburg, store buildings of the period are very rare in the city, and these two buildings are part of a group of less than half a dozen extant and recognizable pre-1830 commercial buildings in Lynchburg. In his 1835 gazetteer of Virginia, Joseph Martin noted that the \\"Lynchburg and eastern turnpike, running S.W. through New London and Liberty, is now completed half the distance.\\" The macadamized road \\"enters Lynchburg at the lower [eastern, or downriver] end of town. To accommodate the wants of the other end, an arm has been constructed from Cocke, or West Street (the northernmost alley) intersecting the turnpike a mile and a half from town.\\" The turnpike mentioned was also known as the Lynchburg & Salem Turnpike, and entered Lynchburg by the route of current Fort Avenue, which turned into Twelfth Street. An 1825 map submitted to the General Assembly shows that \\"7th Alley or Cocke or West Street\\" turned into the \\"Road to Bedford,\\" and that a road that \\"connects with [the] Turnpike\\" veered off of it well after it left the town of Lynchburg (the outer limits were marked by what is now Taylor Street). Using this map and Martin's description, it can be ascertained that the \\"Road to Bedford\\" followed what is now Fifth Street along its present course southwest of College Hill, then followed Memorial Avenue to the vicinity of the present E.C. Glass High School, where it turned to the west and followed the course of Lakeside Drive and Forest Road. The road that, in 1825, connected Fifth Street with the turnpike, followed the course of modern Memorial Avenue, and intersected the turnpike at what would later become the site of Fort Early. Fifth Street businesses likely fought for more convenient access to the Lynchburg & Salem Turnpike, as this route required two miles of travel between the edge of Lynchburg along Fifth Street before one intersected with the turnpike road. The \\"arm\\" that Martin described as accommodating the \\"wants of the other end\\" of town would have departed Fifth Street at its intersection with Monroe Street, and intersected the turnpike at the place called \\"Watering Branch,\\" exactly one and a half miles from downtown. This route, followed today by a portion of Park and Fort Avenues, only required Fifth Street residents to travel one mile before they reached the turnpike. This simple roadway improvement guaranteed Fifth Street's continuance as a commercial center into the second half of the 19th century. By the time of the Civil War, the Fifth Street corridor was home to a number of tobacco warehouses and factories. As casualties from the field began to pour into Lynchburg, which was quickly becoming a major hospital center, all large buildings in the city were appropriated for use as hospitals. By 1862, Reid's and Booker's warehouses, near the intersection of Fifth, Church, and Court Streets, comprised Division 1 of General Hospital Number 1, and Division 3 consisted of Burton's Warehouse (on the west side of Fifth between Harrison and Federal) and Candler's Warehouse, which was on the east side of Fifth near Polk. Many casualties from the hospitals throughout town were sent to what is now known as the Old City Cemetery (118-0027) at Fourth and Monroe Street for burial. In June 1864, Fifth Street played a supporting role in the defense of the city against an attack by Federal General David Hunter. Susan Leigh Blackford recounted that \\"General Breckinridge, with some troops, got here on Wednesday night, and as we saw them passing out West [Fifth] Street…the streets were lined with women, waving their handkerchiefs and cheering them on as they moved out onto a line on the hills west of the city.\\" Cadets from the Virginia Military Institute arrived on June 16, and were ordered to dig defensive lines in the area of Fifth Street as it crested College Hill. That night, the cadets slept amongst the gravestones at the Old City Cemetery. The fighting on June 17 and 18 was primarily limited to the outer defenses, and Lynchburg's inner defenses that stretched from the Old City Cemetery across Fifth Street, and along the ridge of College Hill, were not tested in battle. After the Civil War, tobacco manufacturing continued along the Fifth Street corridor. An 1877 map of Lynchburg shows S.P. Halsey's Prizery at the south corner of Fifth and Clay Streets. The Myers factory was located between Harrison and Federal near Fourth Street, and an unnamed factory was at the north corner of Fifth and Federal. A major complex of tobacco manufacturing buildings was next to the Kentucky Hotel (these were likely built by Pleasant Partin), while Hatcher's factory was across Fifth Street on the north corner of Fifth and Polk. Lastly, a second facility owned by S.P. Halsey was on the south side of the intersection of Fifth Street and Park Avenue. Two examples of tobacco warehouses from the 19th century remain in the district. R.E. Gist's Plug and Twist Tobacco Factory (118-0075) and A.M. Bruce's Plug and Smoking Tobacco Factory (118-5318-0001) are both located in the 400 block of Court Street, and were constructed between 1877 and 1885. In 1883, a new city fire station was constructed at 514 Fifth Street (118-5318-0011). \\"Fire Station No. 1,\\" which boasted 15 men, 1 steam engine (pulled by 4 horses), 1 hose wagon (pulled by 2 horses), and 1 hook and ladder (pulled by 4 horses), served for more than four decades before being supplanted by a new Art Deco style facility designed by Clark and Crowe at the intersection of Fifth and Church Streets (demolished). Biggers School (called the \\"Fifth Avenue Public School\\" in 1890), located at the west corner of Clay and Fifth Streets, opened in 1881 with a capacity of 305 students. The large building was designed by Augustus Forsberg, and was demolished in 1967. Except for the school and the Gist, Bruce, and Halsey tobacco facilities, the \\"lower\\" end of Fifth Street (the 200-400 blocks) was primarily residential in nature during the last quarter of the nineteenth century. The 500 block contained a bakery & confectionery, two grocery stores, an ice cream parlor and dairy, a drug store, the Lynchburg Steam Laundry, and the newly constructed Fifth Street Fire Station (118-5318-0011), which was labeled \\"Fire Station No. 1.\\" The 600 and 700 blocks of Fifth Street boasted 18 stores, a restaurant, wood working shop, and the former Phoenix Carriage Works at Fifth and Federal. Three of these stores remain, including the early 19th century buildings at 612 and 708 Fifth (118-5318-0018 and 118-5318-0027, respectively) and the circa 1850 brick building at 620 Fifth Street (118-5318-0021). The 900 and 1000 blocks of Fifth Street contained six grocery stores (including R.H. Padgett's store, which occupied an ancient c. 1800 store at the corner of Polk and Fifth that was demolished in the mid-20th century), two shoe stores, a candy store, a barber, and two tobacco factories (J.B. Evans & Son and Loyd Phelps & Co.). By the end of the first quarter of the 20th century, the automobile had firmly taken hold in Lynchburg, and the burgeoning city was even home to the Piedmont Motor Car Company, one of only two companies in Virginia that actually manufactured automobiles (this factory was located just over a mile northwest of Fifth Street). New businesses were needed to serve the needs of the now-ubiquitous machines, and gas stations, tire stores, and other establishments began to spring up all over town. Some of the first auto-oriented development that took place along Fifth Street occurred in the previously-residential 400 block. In 1928, the city directory announced that 400 Fifth Street was occupied by the Miller Tire & Battery Company, while the Lynchburg Battery & Ignition Company was located at 406 Fifth Street (both buildings are now joined, and are designated as 118-5317). Ferdinand D. Miller was the proprietor of Miller Tire & Battery at 406 Fifth Street, which sold Hood Tires and Willard Batteries. By 1935, the building was home to Goodyear Service Automobile Tires under the management of Oliver E. Miles. By 1940, the business was being operated under the name of \\"New Tread Company Vulcanizing\\" by D. Earl Burnett. The business specialized in recapping, retreading, and vulcanizing tires, and was a distributor for the U.S. Tire Company. Burnett purchased the building from E.H. Hancock in 1943, and was operating the Burnett-Benson Tire Company on the site by 1945. In addition to U.S. Tires, the business sold Seiberling Tires, radios, sporting goods, and home appliances. A 1945 advertisement boasted that they were the \\"most comprehensive tire service in Lynchburg.\\" By 1955, Burnett-Benson Tire Company had been renamed to simply Burnett Tire Company, and the firm was selling aircraft parts in addition to their automotive parts and accessories. The next year, the company commissioned the architectural firm of Cress & Johnson to design a modern, streamlined facility across the street at what would become 403 Fifth Street (118-5318-0004). An early 20th-century filling station on Fifth StreetAlso in 1927, the automobile showroom at 811 Fifth Street (118-5318-0034) was constructed to house three separate motor companies owned by Myers, Beasley, and Phil Payne. In the 1930s, the building was acquired by Adams Motor Company, which sold cars at the location through the end of the 20th century. The automobile dealership at 407 Federal Street (118-5237) was constructed in 1937 for the Pyramid Motor Corporation, which sold Ford and Lincoln Zephyr automobiles. After 1948, the business changed hands and was called Turner Buick Corporation. The name then changed to Dickerson Buick Corporation in 1955 and to Hemphill Buick-Opel, Inc. in 1970. The building was acquired by the Sheltered Workshop of Lynchburg in 1975, and was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. Other purpose- built automobile-oriented commercial buildings in the district include filling stations at 1100 Fifth (118-5318-0051) and 801 Fifth (118-5318-0032), the Hoskins Pontiac Company showroom at 1101 Fifth (118-5318-0052), and the garages at 619 Fifth (118-5318-0020), 420 Monroe (118-5318-0056), and 507 Harrison Street (118-5318-0022). In 1930, the Lynchburg firm of Johnson and Brannan designed a new bus terminal at the intersection of Fifth and Church Streets for A.F. Young, operator of the nearby Virginian Hotel at 726 Church Street (118-5163-0076). This Greyhound depot (demolished) was the first of two such facilities constructed along Fifth Street, which was part of Lynchburg's primary north-south transportation network. In 1953, a Trailways bus station was constructed at 512 Fifth Street (118-5318-0010). Several residential and commercial buildings along Fifth Street were demolished to make room for the station, and in 1962, the building became known as the Union Bus Station, serving both Trailways and Greyhound passengers. At this time, additional houses along Clay and Madison Streets were demolished to provide larger parking areas. According to Greyhound officials, this instance was the first time (in company history) that the two bus lines had shared a single facility. In 1931, Fifth Street was designated as U.S. Highway 29, which connected Maryland to Florida. Following the construction of the Lynchburg Expressway, Fifth Street was redesignated as U.S. 29's business route. While long-distance traffic may have decreased, local traffic was on the rise as Lynchburg grew and the Fifth Street corridor found itself between downtown and the midtown area, which contained Pittman Plaza (Lynchburg's first shopping center), which was completed in 1960. To increase traffic flow, on-street parking was removed from Fifth Street in order to create two lanes of southbound traffic. In the early 1970s, the Virginia Department of Transportation developed a plan to further increase traffic flow through the area by turning Fourth Street (a narrow residential neighborhood-serving roadway) into a one-way thoroughfare for vehicular traffic, while converting Fifth Street to all one-way in the opposite direction. This plan, along with the assumed significant right-of-way acquisitions that would need to be made in order to enact it, had a chilling effect on any reinvestment that might have otherwise occurred along Fifth Street. Like downtown Lynchburg (and most other downtowns during the 1970s), the Fifth Street commercial district suffered a decline due to large shopping areas including Pittman Plaza and River Ridge Mall, which opened in the early 1980s.  African American Commercial & Cultural Center  Following the Civil War, African Americans realized new opportunities as well as limitations. While amendments to the United States Constitution abolished slavery and granted citizenship to African Americans, a new system of racial discrimination, known as \\"Jim Crow,\\" soon emerged. The majority-controlled society denied African Americans access to respectable jobs and many commercial services, and African Americans formed parallel economies in their own communities. During the late 1880s, most of Fifth Street was predominantly occupied by white residents or business owners. The 400, 600, and 900 blocks had close to twenty percent African American occupancy, while the 1000 block and beyond was generally occupied by a black majority. By 1900, the percentage of African American residents began to increase somewhat, particularly along the 900 block of Fifth Street. By 1910, an African American-dominated business district had evolved in the three block area between Federal and Monroe Streets. Black business owners may have obtained a foothold in the district due to opportunities created by a weak economy in the early years of reconstruction, but the African American business community's rise to prominence was not simply due to passive acceptance of what may have been considered undesirable property by the white business community. Rather, several successful black business leaders, along with newly formed fraternal and social organizations, made significant investments in the corridor by constructing a number of large commercial buildings in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The vanguard of these black business owners included boot and shoe makers Pitman Walker and James Ross, grocer Nelson James, and barber J.O. Ross, who were all operating in the 1000 block of Fifth Street as early as 1881. During this time, many black fraternal organizations were formed, \\"creating social outlets for those seeking camaraderie as well as a sense of belonging in the face of a larger society that neglected them.\\" These groups promoted the concept of \\"self-help,\\" and played a key role in development of a black middle class in southern cities like Lynchburg. By 1872, African American men in Lynchburg formed a local chapter of the Order of True Reformers, a fraternal organization. In 1893, they constructed the landmark building known as the True Reformers Hall (later known as the Harrison Theatre) in the 900 block of Fifth Street on the site of Pleasant Partin's tobacco factory. Perhaps the first \\"mixed use\\" building on Fifth Street, the massive three-story edifice contained a large auditorium, offices, a lodge hall for the True Reformers, and several storefronts at street level. Perhaps as important for its cultural, social, and commercial contribution to the district as its architecture, the True Reformers Hall was demolished in 1985. The African American population in Lynchburg was on the decline by the late 19th century, largely due to the reduction of employees needed in the various tobacco warehouses and factories in the city, which were major employers of blacks. Newer industries in the area, including cotton mills and shoe factories, only employed white laborers (due to necessity if for no other reason, many of these companies would later employ blacks). Despite the reduced role that tobacco played in Lynchburg's economy, the Stalling & Company tobacco factory, which occupied the former Myers building at Fourth and Federal Streets, employed area residents well into the 20th century. James B. Harvey (1928-1984) worked at the Stallings Factory in the 1950s. His son, Richard, later wrote that he \\"went to visit my father once at the Tobacco Factory on Fourth Street…His boss cursed and talked to him as if he was less than a dog. I swore, not one time in my life, would I be subjected to this bigotry.\\" Dubois Miller worked at the factory one summer, and he later recounted that he would \\"come home smelling like tobacco, and I didn't smoke, so I didn't appreciate it. But I needed the money for school, and it was seasonal work.\\" The G. Stalling & Co. Factory was destroyed by fire in 1976. As educational and economic opportunities for African Americans increased, entrepreneurism also increased. In 1904, Lynchburg's black population operated 2 billiard saloons, 2 theatres, and 2 livery stables. There were 3 African American physicians or veterinary surgeons, 3 undertakers, 2 attorneys, 5 hucksters (street vendors), 1 plumber, 1 electrical contractor, 1 chiropodist, 23 barbers, 27 merchants, and 32 houses of private entertainment (private lodging facilities that did not serve alcohol) .. Thus, to some extent, the black community began to mitigate the effects of segregation in the industrial workplace with their own business opportunities, many of which operated on Fifth Street (or Fifth Avenue, as it was sometimes called during this period). By 1900, the Kentucky Hotel (118-0177), a former tavern and residence, was the home to Smith's Business College, which provided educational opportunities to African Americans. Its students included Rev. George Robert Jones of Suffolk, who graduated in 1897. An 1899 advertisement in the Richmond Planet announced that the school offered courses in \\"phonographic, penning, commercial, English…\\", and a 1908 publication lauded T. Parker Smith, the school's director, as \\"one of the pioneers\\" in the work of training African Americans in the principles of business. Smith, a Missouri native who graduated from Lincoln University in 1888, married Clara Alexander of Lynchburg. By 1911, they had moved to Durham, North Carolina, where he was the Dean of the Commercial Department at the National Religious Training School, and Clara served as the head of the Teacher's Department. By 1934, Smith was operating a new Smith's Business College in Kansas City, Missouri. In 1915, local African American businessman Adolphus Humbles (1845-1926) built what is known as the Humbles Building (118-5318-0039) at 901 Fifth Street. Like the True Reformers Hall, the Humbles Building is a large, three-story, mixed use facility that contained two storefronts on the first floor and an auditorium on the second floor. Humbles was a successful merchant in Campbell County, and operated the toll road between Lynchburg and Rustburg (the seat of Campbell County). He served as the Treasurer of both the Virginia State Baptist Convention and the Virginia Theological Seminary and College (now known as the Virginia University of Lynchburg), where the school's main building bears his name. Also active in politics, he served as Chairman of the Campbell County Executive Committee for the Republican Party for thirteen years. In 1919, the former Gist Tobacco Factory at 410 Court Street (118-0075) was converted into Mill No. 2 of the Lynchburg Hosiery Mills Company (Mill No. 1 [118-0126] was on Fort Avenue), which had the specific purpose of employing African American women. At the time, it was said that no other business or industry in Lynchburg had hired black women, who, up until this point, were limited to performing domestic work in white households. Mill No. 2 operated until 1971, and generally employed between 150 and 200 black women at any given time. As at Mill No. 1, the segregated employees of Mill No. 2 formed a \\"Lynchburg Hosiery Mills Association,\\" which provided benefits including an early form of medical insurance, disability benefits, unemployment benefits, and savings plans. When the Civil Rights Act was passed in 1964, the two separate Lynchburg Hosiery Mill Associations were merged, and both black and white employees then belonged to the same association. As previously mentioned, three African American undertakers were in business in Lynchburg at the turn of the century. John Shuemaker & Co. operated at 417 Monroe Street, and was a former partner with Squire Higginbotham. Their funeral home, established in 1868, is thought to be the oldest black business of the type in Lynchburg. Squire's son, McGustavus (1868-1934), owned the firm of Strange & Higginbotham, which was located at 909 Fifth Street (118-5318-0040). This business was the predecessor to the current Community Funeral Home, which was established by M.W. \\"Teedy\\" Thornhill, Jr. Thornhill served on Lynchburg City Council from 1976 to 1992, and in 1990, was elected as Lynchburg's first African American mayor. C.V. Wilson's Funeral Home was located at 810 Fifth Street, but was demolished in 1968 to make additional car lot space for Adams Motor Company. Carl Hutcherson, Sr. erected a new funeral home at 918 Fifth Street (118-5318-0042) in 1963. Hutcherson was the first African American to serve on the Lynchburg School Board, and his son, the Rev. Carl B. Hutcherson, Jr., took over the mortuary business, served on Lynchburg City Council from 1996 to 2006 (he was Mayor from 2000 to 2006). On March 5, 1918, a group of African American women rented the house at 613 Monroe Street (118-5318-0061) in order to begin Y.W.C.A. programs for women of color. Soon after, Adela Ruffin, Field Secretary for all black Y.W.C.A. participants in the South, came to Lynchburg to encourage local leadership to create a separate chapter, but her suggestion was tabled. In 1919, however, an official Phyllis Wheatley Branch was formed in Lynchburg, and 15 African American women established a Committee of Management. The Central Association (white-controlled organization), located on Church Street, offered to help the Phyllis Wheatley Branch in \\"any way that it could, but was unable to assist financially.\\" In 1924, the trustees of the Old Dominion Elks Lodge #181, who had purchased 613 Monroe from the Merchants National Bank of Raleigh in 1919, sold the house to the Y.W.C.A. for $4,000. In 1937, it was reported that the branch had outgrown their building at 613 Monroe, and that a committee had been formed to evaluate their options. While the branch had saved money for renovations through the years, they would also need to obtain support from the community. Amy Jordan, a teacher at a \\"colored college\\" (Virginia Theological Seminary) was the chairman of the Committee of Management, and Grace Booker, a native of Columbus, Ohio, was Executive Secretary of the branch. Later, Booker became the first African American Director of the Metropolitan Y.W.C.A. in Baltimore. An undated brochure produced by the Phyllis Wheatley Y.W.C.A. sought to raise $45,000 for the purpose of moving the branch from its house at 613 Monroe Street, which was labeled as \\"Old—Outgrown\\" to a larger building at 600 Monroe Street, which was labeled \\"Modern—Adequate.\\" 600 Monroe Street was known as the \\"Tal-Fred Apartments\\" (118-5318-0060), and was built circa 1940 on property formerly occupied by the Independent Order of St. Luke. The newly- constructed apartment building appears to have contained six spacious units, all of which were occupied by African Americans. The Phyllis Wheatley Branch apparently raised the necessary funds to acquire the property, and hired prominent Lynchburg architect Pendleton S. Clark to plan modifications to the building's interior. The Y.W.C.A. branch moved into the building by 1950, and it is still owned by the organization today. The Y.W.C.A. program in Lynchburg was integrated in the early 1970s. In 1924, the house at 1014 Fifth Street (118-5318-0049) was occupied by the Elks Rest, a facility for African Americans. In 1936, Willis Sandidge was the manager of the Elks Rest, and Old Dominion Lodge #181, IBPOE (Elks) used the building as its principal office and meeting location. In need of additional assembly space, the organization added a large concrete masonry unit addition to the rear of the building by 1951, and the grocery store operated by James Harper and later Robert Miller at 1016 Fifth Street was incorporated into the Elks Lodge complex. For most of the first half of the 20th century, the Kentucky Hotel (118-0177) at 900 Fifth Street served as the Odd Fellows Hall, with rental office space on the first floor and the second floor contained the lodge hall itself. In 1954, the building housed the Grand Order of the Odd Fellows, Odd Fellows Lodge No. 1475, St. Luke's Lodge No. 1475, Sons of Zion Lodge No. 1446, and West Hill Lodge No. 1704. By 1962, the Augustine Leftwich House at 614 Federal Street (118-5318-0063) began a new life as the \\"Masonic Home.\\" Joseph C. Watson resided at the house (perhaps as a manager or caretaker) and the building housed the Star of the West Lodge No. 24 (AF&AM;), Order of the Eastern Star Lynchburg Chapter No. 40, and Order of the Eastern Star Goodwill Chapter No. 125 (all of these were African American organizations). The building at 614 Federal Street continues to serve the Star of the West Lodge today. Walter Johnson Medical OfficeIn addition to serving as the \\"Main Street\\" of Lynchburg's African American community, the corridor served as the community's health and medicine center. By 1940, all but one of Lynchburg's black physicians as well as all four black dentists had offices on Fifth Street. Perhaps Lynchburg's best-known African American physician, Dr. R. Walter Johnson (1889-1971) attended Lincoln University and Meharry Medical College. His Lynchburg practice began in the mid-1930s, and was first located in the Humbles Building at 901 Fifth Street (118-5318-0039). In 1951, he constructed the office building at 1001 Fifth Street (118-5318-0047), which still bears his name in large aluminum letters along the façade. He was the first African American to be allowed to practice at Lynchburg General Hospital, and became a well-known tennis coach for young African American players, including Arthur Ashe and Althea Gibson. He founded the American Tennis Association Junior Development Program for African American youth as well as an all-expenses paid tennis camp. His home and tennis court at 1422 Pierce Street (118-0225-0077) were individually listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2002, and Centra Health's outpatient clinic at 320 Federal Street is named in his honor. His sister, Dr. Eileen El-Dorado Johnson, was educated in Switzerland and worked in New York before moving to Lynchburg in 1967, where she established a practice on Fifth Street. Dr. Fred L. Lander, Jr. (1898-1941) a veteran of World War I, had an office at the corner of Fifth and Polk Streets (demolished in 1992). He was one of the first African American physicians to use sulfa drugs to treat venereal diseases, a serious health problem during the 1930s, when three times as many Virginia blacks as whites died of syphilis. Dr. Leon Braswell's (1904-1958) office was located at 808 Fifth Street (demolished); he practiced from 1937 to 1958. In 1949, he was named state Vice President of the National Medical Association. Dr. Clarissa Wimbush (d. 1986) was the first black female dentist in Virginia, and earned her D.D.S. degree from Howard University. She opened an office at 911-913 Fifth (demolished 1979) in 1926, and practiced more than fifty years. Dr. Augustus Nathaniel Lushington (1869-1939) was born on Trinidad in the West Indies and is believed to be one of the first African Americans in the country to receive a degree in veterinary medicine, which he earned at the University of Pennsylvania in 1897. His home and practice was located in the house at 1005 Fifth Street (118-5318-0048). From 1959 until he retired, Dr. Kyle M. Pettus (1881-1967) occupied Lushington's house. In all, more than twenty physicians practiced on Fifth Street, primarily in the 800-1000 blocks. The Humbles Building hosted at least nine doctors and dentists over the years. In support of the many physicians along the corridor was pharmacists Harry W. Reid (1892-1969). Reid opened his pharmacy, first called Bacchus & Reid, in 1919 at the Humbles Building. By 1930, there were twenty-one black-owned drugstores in the State of Virginia. The 1940 Lincoln Memorial Book of Lynchburg (a locally- produced African American business and cultural directory) stated that Reid's \\"place of business is thoroughly modern, in appearance and in every other respect. It is the only drug store in the city owned and operated by colored people and it is a real credit to Lynchburg.\\" In 1936, Reid moved his business to the New Era building, a large mixed-use facility (similar to the Humbles Building and the True Reformers Hall) located at 919 Fifth Street (it was demolished in 1992). African Americans with medical training were not the only benefactors of Lynchburg's health care community. Whit N. Brown (1895-1946) was a New York native and enjoyed success as a \\"real estate proprietor\\" in Lynchburg. Locally, he was known as the \\"King of Fifth Street.\\" His lifelong friend, Harry Reid, later recounted that Brown \\"was very honest in his thoughts. The Negroes have been working since 1925 to get a hospital of their own, but Whit wouldn't agree. 'Lynchburg Hospital belongs to the whole city,' he told them, 'us as much as anybody, and we don't want to improve and pay for what we get over there.'\\" When Brown died in 1946, he donated his entire estate to Lynchburg General Hospital, including the brick duplex at 411-413 Polk Street (118-5318-0043) that he had constructed as rental property only six years earlier. Lynchburg General Hospital kept the building (likely earning income from residential rentals) until 1971. The Lynchburg Branch of the N.A.A.C.P. (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) sponsored the Legacy Project to provide educational exhibits and programs on the history and culture of African Americans in the area. The Legacy Project received 501(c)3 nonprofit status in 1995 and acquired a dilapidated house at 403 Monroe Street two years later. Lynchburg architect Kelvin Moore was engaged to help transform the 100-year-old house into a modern museum. A Capital Fundraising Committee was formed to raise $300,000, and a Collections Committee was formed to solicit and archive artifacts for the permanent collection. On June 25, 2000 a celebratory dedication and grand opening was held, and the Legacy Museum of African American History hosts a number of changing exhibits about black culture in the region.  Fifth Street Today  Fifth Street Roundabout during the Christmas SeasonFor more than two centuries, Fifth Street has served as a major commercial and transportation artery for Lynchburg, and served as the heart of the region's African American community for over 100 years. Like many urban neighborhoods, the Fifth Street Historic District has suffered architectural losses over the years, but still retains the feeling and character of an urban business district. The first decade of the 21st century has been witness to renewed community interest in the corridor, which has been championed by organizations including the Fifth Street Community Development Corporation (the CDC) and the Lynchburg Neighborhood Development Foundation (LNDF). LNDF was instrumental in expanding the boundaries of the Court House Hill-Downtown Historic District (118-5163), rehabilitating a number of homes in the 500-700 blocks of Madison and Harrison Streets, and served as the developer for Centra Health's P.A.C.E. Center, which is located in the Pyramid Motors Building (118-5237). The CDC, along with the City of Lynchburg, spearheaded the development of the 2006 Fifth Street Master Plan. The CDC and LNDF are currently collaborating to rehabilitate several buildings in the 700 block of Fifth Street (two of which were slated for demolition by their former owner in early 2011). The second phase of a major three-phase streetscape and utility infrastructure improvement was completed in 2013.

There were 600 delegates and observers of the preparatory meeting. The Sami Parliament of Norway hosted the event. It was drafted through democratic processes, facilitated by a writing group consisting of indigenous peoples' representatives from all global regions. Some questioned whether the document reflected genuine consensus, given diversity of the world's indigenous peoples. The ambition of the indigenous peoples involved was to have the document be accepted as an official United Nations document. Key topics included: * indigenous peoples' lands, territories, resources, oceans and waters; * implementation of the rights of indigenous peoples and UN action to support it; * indigenous peoples' priorities for development with free, prior and informed consent; * relationship between governments, indigenous peoples and extractive industries regarding participation, access to decision-making and distribution of income.

It is built around the site of Drumsagard Castle and immediately south of the site of Hallside Steelworks, also known as the Cambuslang Iron and Steel Works. One of the first facilities of their kind and eventually extending over an area of around 33 acres, the steelworks were established in 1873 and closed in 1979.Images of Hallside Village houses, Canmore History The Parish of Cambuslang in the Barony of Drumsargard, also spelt Drumsagart, meaning \\"ridge of the priest\\" – can be traced back to the time of King Alexander II of Scotland (1214–49) when it belonged to Walter Olifard, Justiciar of Lothian. The Barony of Drumsargard (whose castle ruins can be discerned to the south-east of Hallside although none of the structure itself now remains) passed to Archibald Douglas, 3rd Earl of Douglas in 1370, as part of the settlement in his marriage to Johanna, daughter of Thomas Moray of Bothwell. In 1452 the Douglases were displaced in favour of James Lord Hamilton, who became tenant-in-chief in 1455. This feudal superiority remained with the Dukes of Hamilton – who were also the largest landowners – up until 1922, though the abolition of feudalism in Scotland did not come until the end of the 20th Century. Hallside Village In the 19th and early 20th century there were several working farms and a small colliery on the land which is now modern housing.1996 West Hallside, The Blantyre Project, 8 May 2019 Hallside House, the mansion overlooking the area (built by George Jardine), was located off Manse Brae at the eastern side of the parish of Cambuslang, near the boundary with Blantyre; it survived until the 1930s.Hallside House, Old Country Houses of the Old Glasgow Gentry There was also a small community built for the steel workers and the managers which had associated schools and churchesBuildings of Scotland: Glasgow (page 504), Elizabeth Williamson, Anne Riches, Malcolm Higgs, 1990, but that has all but disappeared, save for a group of sandstone houses known as Hallside Village which were restored in the late 20th century.Images of Hallside Village houses, Canmore The majority of the modern suburb was constructed in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In the 2010s, one of the remaining farms (East Hallside) was demolished and converted into a further area of new housing. Facilities Drumsagard retail zone Drumsagard is within the Cambuslang East ward of the South Lanarkshire Council area which is also the extent of the neighbourhood community policing zone. There is a small precinct of shops at the southern edge of the development, and the closest area with a wider range of amenities is Halfway. There are currently two schools in the vicinity of Drumsagard – Hallside Primary, a 21st century incarnation of the previous school of the same name which was mainly attended by children of the steel workers), and Park View Primary, an additional smaller facility to accommodate the number of pupils, mostly from new homes in Drumsagard, which had become too much for Hallside despite several extensions to its capacity. Both of these schools are non- denomonational; the nearest Catholic schools are St. Charles' in Newton and St. Cadoc's in Halfway. At the north side of Drumsagard is Newton railway station which links to Glasgow city centre, Cambuslang, Rutherglen and Hamilton. A major bus route between Glasgow and Hamilton (First Glasgow's '267') serves the area with stops near to the shops at the southern boundary. After securing a grant from 'Award for All', the residents association funded a feasibility study which resulted in the addition of sporting facilities in the village in 2010. A multi-use games area and sports pitch are part of the sports facilities.

Life Yastrebov was born in 1839 in the village of Gromushka, in the Tambov Governorate, into a priestly family. He was educated in Astrakhan, which at that time was a business and cultural centre of the Russian Empire, and the connection to Middle Asia as a melting pot of European and Asian influence. He later studied at the seminary in Kazan, where he spent some years and finished as a student, having learnt the classical languages. His admission to the Department for the Study of Eastern languages defined his decision to work in diplomacy. On 1 January 1866, he was appointed a diplomat in the Russian delegate in the Ottoman capital, Istanbul, where he stayed for a year, with the rank of vežbaonik. At this time, Russia played the role of protector of the Orthodox population in the Ottoman Empire. On 1 January 1867 he was appointed the secretary and translator in the Russian Consulate in the Scutari Vilayet. The consulate was established in order to counter the influence of the Austrian and French consulates. He was the Vice-Consul, seated in Prizren, from 1 April 1870 to 18 August 1874. During that period, at times, he replaced the Russian Consul in Scutari, and on 5 August 1874 was moved to Scutari as a Consul. After a year, he became a member of Andriyashev's consulate commission (on 17 August 1875) for the Sanjak of Herzegovina, until his return to Prizren as Russian Consul on 1 July 1879; he was a witness to the armed conflicts resulting from interests between Russia and Austria-Hungary. After Prizren, he worked in the Sanjak of Ioanninna since 6 September 1880, and returned to Prizren 20 February 1881, staying until March 1886. He was then moved to the General Consulate in Thessaloniki. He died on 8 January 1894 in Thessaloniki, where he was buried. Work During his diplomatic service, he wrote many studies on the regions where he stayed, for which he received a great accolade from scientific institutions, not only from Russia but from the Balkan states as well, and he also received a variety of awards and other recognitions. *Demographic study of the Sanjak of Scutari, 1874, Belgrade *(\\"Customs and Songs of the Turkish Serbs\\"), 1886, St. Petersburg *Stara Srbija i Albanija (\\"Old Serbia and Albania\\"), 1904, Belgrade In 1879 Russian consul in Montenegro, Yastrebov, published his notes about his visit to Shkodër, which also included visit to ruins of Baleč.

Jastrebov was first to record a song, in Macedonian region of Debar, about the conflict between Prince Marko and Korun Aramija (Marko and the Highland Fighter Korun).

He is known as a rival of Prince Marko, another hero of South Slavic folklore. The epic hero Korun Aramija is based on actual historical person, Theodor Corona Musachi from Muzaka family that was in conflict with Prince Marko over the town of Kastoria.  Historical background  The Muzaka family was in conflict with Prince Marko before his death in 1396 which is probably why Theodor Corona Musachi is commemorated in Serbian and south Slavic epic poetry as Korun, Marko's enemy. The term Aramija is derived from Turkish word for bandit ().  Epic poems  Songs about Korun and Nenad Jugović (three different versions) were collected by Vuk Karadžić and published posthumously in 1899 in chapter titled \\"The earliest songs about heroes\\" (). In epic poetry from Macedonia Korun Aramija is also described as attacking nuptial, making love to widows etc. and always being killed at the end by Sekula, Kostadin or Popović Ivan. Song about fight between Prince Marko and Korun Aramija (Marko and the Highland Fighter Korun) was first recorded by Ivan Stepanovič Jastrebov in Macedonian region of Debar. This song has similar motif as song about Prince Marko and Musa Kesedžija because Marko was again fighting against better hero who also is depicted as having more than one heart.

LNG gasification plants can be located on land as well as on floating barges. Floating barge mounted plants have the advantage that they can be towed to new offshore locations for better usage in response to changes in the business environment. In a conventional regasification plantRU, LNG is heated by sea water to convert it to natural gas / methane gas. Byproducts In addition to regasification, many valuable industrial byproducts can be produced using cold energy of LNG.LNG Cold Energy Utilization at LNG Receiving Terminals Cold energy of LNG utilisation for extracting liquid oxygen and nitrogen gas from air, makes LNG-regasification plants more viable when they are located near integrated steel plants and/or urea plants. Cold energy of LNG usage in lieu of massive and energy intensive cryogenic refrigeration units in natural-gas processing plants is also more viable economically. The natural gas processed with cold energy of LNG and the imported LNG can be readily injected into a conventional natural gas distribution system to reach the ultimate consumers. The cold energy of LNG can be used for cooling the exhaust fluid of the gas turbine which is working in closed joule cycle with Argon gas as fluid. Thus near 100% conversion efficiency to electricity is achieved for the LNG/natural gas consumed by the gas turbine as its exhaust heat is fully used/absorbed for the gasification of LNG. However, the abundant availability of natural gas, and the mature technology and its acceptability in using the LNG directly (without regasification) in road and rail vehicles would lead to lesser demand for LNG regasification plants.The On-Road LNG Transportation Market in the US See also *Gas-to-liquids *Existing regasification terminals *Liquid air *CNG carrier ReferencesExternal links *Dynamic depressurisation calculations LNG regasification unit *Global LNG Regasification Markets Category:Liquefied natural gas Category:Fuel gas Category:Petroleum industry ","title":"Regasification"},{"id":"41006277","text":"Clinton Dickson Chandler (4 April 1910 – 6 June 1969) was an Australian rules footballer who played with Carlton and Hawthorn in the Victorian Football League (VFL).

After being demoted for poor conduct, he resigned from this force and became a drover, leading the first herds of cattle into the region now known as the Northern Territory. He later became, amongst other vocations, a gold prospector, butcher and hotelier. Throughout his life, Uhr actively engaged in multiple incidents of frontier violence including several massacres of Aboriginals. He was also the subject of numerous court cases defending charges which ranged from murder and assault to race-fixing and fraud. In later life he moved to Western Australia and became a business partner with Charles Kidman, brother of the famous pastoralist, Sidney Kidman. Early life Wentworth D'Arcy Uhr was born at Wivenhoe station on the upper reaches of the Brisbane River on 31 October 1845. His father was Edmund Blucher Uhr, a squatter who had previously set up runs for prominent colonist Richard Jones at Patrick's Plains, Liverpool Plains and at Tent Hill. Conflict with Aboriginals defending the usurpation of their lands led to the death of Wentworth's uncle, John Uhr, and, despite subsequent extrajudicial killings of local Aboriginals, the family were forced to move to the Wide Bay-Burnett region of the colony. After setting up a pastoral run at Mundooya, they settled at the township of Maryborough where Wentworth's father became a magistrate and the proprietor of a boiling down establishment. Native Police As a magistrate, Wentworth's father Edmund B. Uhr had frequent interaction with the Native Police. This force was a government funded paramilitary corps designed to brutally suppress Aboriginals who resisted British occupation. Edmund later requested that the Queensland Government provide a position for his son in the Native Police and Wentworth was appointed as an Acting sub-Inspector in 1865. Wentworth's brother, Reginald Charles Uhr, was already an officer in this force, directing \\"dispersals of blacks\\" around Bowen and Cardwell. Wentworth D'arcy Uhr's first major duty in the Native Police was to provide an armed escort for the expedition of William Landsborough to the Gulf of Carpentaria in 1866. They arrived at Burketown in April to find the settlement in an epidemic of fever and went over to nearby Bentinck Island and Sweers Island to avoid illness. At Sweers Island, Uhr and his troopers shot several of the local people. Returning to Burketown in June, Uhr was soon ordered to conduct a long distance pursuit to arrest several horse thieves, a journey which took him 1500 miles into north-west New South Wales. In 1868, Uhr and his troopers conducted three major massacres of Aboriginals in the Gulf area. The first at the McArthur River, the second just south of Burketown, and the third near the Norman River. Around a hundred people were killed and according to a newspaper correspondent, the Burketown residents were \\"delighted with the wholesale slaughter\\". Dr Henry Challinor, one of the few Queensland politicians who was consistently opposed to the ruthless methods of the Native Police, led calls for an inquiry. Uhr was demoted and forced to travel to Brisbane and front an investigation into the massacres. He received the support of family, the media and the government and he was exonerated of any wrongdoing. He returned to Burketown but quit the Native Police in 1869. Uhr remained in Burketown as a private citizen but continued to be a controversial figure. During the years 1870 and 1871, he became involved in legal disputes with William Landsborough and other officials, and was accused of kidnapping Aboriginal children. In a separate incident, Uhr was arrested for the murder of an Aboriginal man at Dalgonally station south of Normanton. His hearing was postponed and he was eventually acquitted by local magistrates. Droving In 1872, Uhr was contracted by Mathew Dillon Cox to help guide and drive his herds of cattle from Rockhampton to the frontier region around Palmerston in the Northern Territory in what was the first cattle drive along the Gulf-McArthur-Katherine route. The journey involved transgressing through the lands of number of Aboriginal clans and four major incidents of violence occurred. The first was 100 miles west of Burketown where in response to a boomerang being thrown at one of Cox's men, local Aboriginals were shot at, rounded up and forced to provide hostages. The second occurred west of the McArthur River at a place called Calico Creek. Here, after spears were thrown, Uhr and his colleagues opened up into sustained rifle-fire. After the Aboriginals retreated, the drovers rode up and down the creek, burning a village and its contents. In a separate incident, the droving group took Aboriginal children from another clan. Later, at the Wickham River 50 miles from the Roper River, a \\"regular pitched battle\\" took place where after their horses were speared, Uhr \\"ordered every man to arms...and made them fire by files\\". After half an hour of \\"continuous rattle of rifle shots\\" where \\"each man took deliberate aim\\", the Aboriginal people targeted had \\"fearful proofs in the numbers of their comrades who writhed or lay forever motionless\\". In September the group arrived at a British supply depot on the Roper River. While here, Cox and Uhr had a disagreement which resulted in Uhr knocking down Cox and pulling out a large handful of his hair. As there were magistrates posted at the Roper depot, Cox officially charged Uhr with assault in what was the first known court proceeding in that area of the Northern Territory. William Bloomfield Douglas presided over the case and it was settled when Uhr agreed to an immediate dismissal from his position on the condition that Cox supplied him with provisions to head to the new gold diggings around Port Darwin. Gold prospecting After taking his leave of Cox's droving party, Uhr became a gold prospector and became the first to lodge a claim at the Pine Creek goldfields in 1872. Butcher at Palmer River By 1875, Uhr followed the gold rushes back to Northern Queensland and became a butcher at the Palmer River Goldfields selling fresh meat to the diggers. He set up a store at Uhr's Camp between Maytown and Byerstown. There was frequent violence between the miners and the local Aboriginals who were forcibly displaced from their homes. Uhr, again, became involved at the forefront of these skirmishes. After a Chinese miner was killed by Aboriginals, Uhr organised an armed posse to track down and collectively punish Aboriginals in the area. They found an encampment to attack and despite \\"hard fighting\\" with breechloaders and revolvers, they were forced to retreat. Uhr later wrote an open letter demanding a large contingent of Native Police to be based on the Palmer River to destroy Aboriginal resistance in the area. In early 1876, the request was granted and Inspector Townsend and his troopers were sent to the region. Return to Northern Territory Uhr remained in northern Queensland until 1880 when he returned to the Northern Territory undertaking further droving and prospecting work. In 1883, he was again at the McArthur River guiding overlanders across the stock route. Here, a group of Aboriginals killed several of his horses and a white man named Fraser. Uhr, with the assistance of stockmen travelling in the area with Nathaniel Buchanan, \\"followed up the blacks\\" to a camp 10 miles from the river. Here he conducted a massacre, the results of which so disturbed Donald Swan of Nat Buchanan's group that only death threats against Swan prevented him from reporting it to authorities. Uhr resided around Palmerston and Pine Creek, establishing pubs, butchering businesses, pastoral runs and investing in mining leases. He was publicly supportive of mounted police massacres of Aboriginals resisting colonisation and he was also active in anti-Chinese immigration organisations. Uhr himself led further vigilante raids of Aboriginal people on the Mary River and Goyder River. He was involved in several legal proceedings and won damages in 1885 to the value of 3,000 Pounds sterling after a wrongful arrest for cattle theft. Coolgardie Uhr left the Northern Territory in late 1888 and for the next several years he lived in the more southern states, droving in New South Wales and operating hotels in Sydney and Adelaide. In 1894 he once more followed the Australian gold rush to Western Australia and the town of Coolgardie. Here he went into a butchering partnership with Charles Nunn Kidman, brother of the famous pastoralist, Sidney Kidman. Later he formed the company Butcher and Uhr, which was involved in expanding into pastoral development. Uhr went on expeditions to acquire land in the Laverton region and at Mount Margaret Uhr led a vigilante attack on the local Aboriginals. He was involved in the local horse racing industry and became embroiled in illegal betting syndicates. Uhr died at Coolgardie in 1907 and was given a lavish public funeral. He was married twice, firstly to Jane Hayes in 1872 and then to Essie Thompson in 1885. As he had not separated from Hayes, Uhr was in a situation of bigamy until 1887 when Hayes died. His grandson, Clive Uhr, would become a noted radiologist and Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire.

He was voted Menswear Designer of the Year in 2005 by the British Fashion Council.  Menswear career  His first work was Squire, launched in 1991, where Carlo fused the ideas of art, architecture and design by pioneering one of the first 'creative director roles' in fashion, it was the first project of its type to draw and encompass many different types of design aesthetics into a concept space in Mayfair which epitomised the beginnings of Cool Britannia. The gallery displayed design collections within the same space as classic ‘pop art’ pieces from artists such as Allen Jones and Bridget Riley. Early collaborators, clients and admirers of Squire were Alexander Mcqueen (who wore Squire designs to his first historic Givenchy interview), Massive Attack, Kate Moss, Helmut Lang and most of the iconoclasts of design, music and style scenes. Nick Knight and Peter Saville (photographer and art director respectively) were initial collaborators. Squire questioned the boundaries between design, fashion and art, pioneering a more open and broad spectrum of how designers were perceived to be able to work within other creative disciplines and mediums. Initially specialising in tailoring, Carlo used traditional Savile Row craft together with relevant modern design principles. It was during this period that Carlo started to work on unstructured tailoring, with the first ideas produced in 1999. Unstructured tailoring changed the way tailoring was seen, up until then full structured heavier suits with interlinings and horse hair chest pieces was the norm. Carlo wanted to design tailoring that was completely unlined and without internal structure, allowing the cut to dictate any external shape. The designs were lighter and more comfortable. He christened the work \\"Unstructured Tailoring\\" and the menswear industry has adopted this term to define all design of this nature. During this period Carlo worked as a freelance menswear designer for Burberry and Valentino in Japan. After five years of the concept work at Squire and having achieved all that he had set out to for this project, unexpectedly in 2003 Kilgour approached Carlo to become creative director. This project offered an opportunity to define and work on creating and building every element of a new Kilgour, a different ‘type’ of creative and artistic work. Carlo set the brief to create a modern hybrid menswear brand combining the craft and heritage of Savile Row with all aspects of modern current design. Carlo conceived the concept of the brand, controlled all design, designed the flagship spaces and the campaigns. The project was critically and commercially very successful with Carlo receiving many diverse plaudits and awards including British GQ Most Stylish Man and being voted Menswear Designer of the Year in 2005 by the British Fashion Council, the highest award achievable in this field. In 2008 Kilgour changed ownership shortly before Carlo's debut on the Paris catwalk in 2009, Carlo promptly resigned, leaving the brand he founded as Kilgour. In 2013 Kilgour changed hands again and the new owners approached Carlo to reprise his role as freelance creative director, the remit was to re-position Kilgour as an \\"International Contemporary Bespoke Brand and Tailor\\".  Artist career  In 2009 Carlo established his own studio working with clients privately as a consultant design and creative director. The studio also focuses on artistic work, his first sculpture solo show ‘Permanence 2010 - Travertine marble stone & gold’ opened on June 25, 2010 at RCM Galerie in Paris. In October 2010, some Permanence pieces were also shown at the Art Elysees Contemporary Art Fair in Paris together with the art/design specialist crossover gallery RCM. In October 2011 several works were made in collaboration with the American contemporary artist Matthew Brannon with Casey Kaplan Gallery New York and shown at London’s Frieze Art Fair. Carlo produced a series of abstract coat sculptures made from rubber coated cotton as part of Matthew’s work with Casey Kaplan. Matthew Brannon’s solo show then opened in New York at Casey Kaplan in October 2011 and Carlo worked on several collaborative pieces which have been acquired by the acclaimed Contemporary Rennie Collection at Wing Sang gallery in Vancouver. For 2013 several glass works were made in Murano as part of a ‘floating series’, all pieces were acquired by a private collection, a second series entitled ‘Left Glass' was produced in 2016 and shown at RCM Galerie in Paris. Carlo was chosen as the prestigious Pitti Uomo show guest designer project in 2015, where he showed a 6-square meter coloured glass installation in the courtyard of the Medici Palazzo in Florence, the installation was part of his presentation on menswear. In 2017 Carlo was one of only a handful of menswear designers that was chosen to show in MOMA Museum Of Modern Art New York seminal show ' Is fashion Modern ', where important designs spanning the last 100 years were chosen for the major exhibition. Carlo's Unstructured suit design work for tailoring was selected. Carlo is a regular lecturer on design and is an established commentator to the international design scene.

He was one of the first German contemporary fine-art photographers to have his work shown in solo exhibitions in German art museums.One of the first exhibitions of fine-art photography in a German-speaking country was shown in 1977 at the documenta 6. Cf. Catalogue of documenta 6, volume 2: Fotografie, Film, Video, Kassel 1977. Life and career Thull grew up in Bochum, Germany, in an artistically inclined household; his father was concertmaster of the Bochum symphony orchestra. In 1968 he began studying visual communication/photo design/fine-art photography at the Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts, where Pan Walther was among his teachers; he completed his studies in 1973, receiving his degree as a Diplom Designer. After finishing his studies he began his career as an independent fine artist. He initially worked almost exclusively in the field of fine-art photography. From 1983 to 1986 he served as a lecturer at the Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts, where he taught primarily experimental and fine-art photography.For a biographical sketch cf.: Goethe House New York (ed.), Four Aspects of Contemporary German Photography: Rolf Glasmeier, Robert Häusser, Hans Rudolf Thull, Pan Walther, Essen 1984, p. 18. During a decisive period lasting from 1989 to 2000 he explored additional art forms: collage and sculpture. His affinity for these areas had already been displayed in isolated earlier works, for example, in his 1985 sculpture \\"Boden–Raum–Skulptur\\" for the Ruhr valley project \\"gRenzüberschreitung\\". Thull’s work has been exhibited at major German and international museums in exhibitions organised by prominent curators, such as Thomas Grochowiak and Uwe Rüth. His first exhibition was \\"Realität – Irrealität\\", together with Rolf Glasmeier; it was shown at the Ludwig Galerie Schloss Oberhausen and at the Kunsthalle Recklinghausen from 1979 to 1980. He was thus one of the first German contemporary fine-art photographers to have his work shown in solo exhibitions in German art museums. Hans Rudolf Thull lives and works in Bochum. Works In his work the exploration of various phenomena related to dualisms and interaction provide the primary point of departure. In his photographic works Thull generates dualisms by removing everyday objects and situations from their original framework and placing them in a different context using means that range from unconventional cropping and camera techniques to shaking or moving the camera while shooting. These interactions lead to a break with traditional visual habits, provide motifs with a new identity and reveal dualities. Thus they \\"contain propositions and possibilities for viewers to stir their imagination and to activate creative impulses through their own contemplation and activity\\".Grochowiak, Thomas, in: idem (ed.), Realität – Irrealität, Herten 1979, p. III. His photographic series can thus be categorised as examples of experimental photography, and some of them also as \\"Subjective Photography\\" (Subjektive Fotografie). Thull works primarily in colour, both with middle-format analogue (film) photography and with full-frame digital SLR. His collages focus on the duality of media–consumer. Using primarily print media he employs various techniques of cutting, tearing and gluing as well as contradictory arrangements in terms of sequence, accumulation and reduction to generate sensory disruptions – calling into question the perceptual processes that have been imposed upon us: \\"Everyday symbols have, so to speak, taken over an additional level of reality.\\"Bove, Jens, \\"Ästhetik des Realen\\", in: Scheps, Marc (ed.), Unser Jahrhundert: Menschenbilder – Bilderwelten, Munich/New York 1995, p. 103. It is generally possible to physically interact with his sculptures made of tubular and plate steel, which take the dualities of viewpoint–perception and surface–space as their theme; they generate interactions between form, material, light, viewer and environment. \\"By changing standpoints or perspectives a communicatively variable whole is created in the crossing of visual boundaries.\\"Rüth, Uwe, in: Leismann, Burkhard and Rüth, Uwe (eds.), Industrial Land Art im Ruhrland, Essen 2009, p. 171. The basis of his works is provided either by flat, geometric steel plates – which are lifted from the plane and into space by means of incisions, angling their corners, causing them to buckle and through their placement relative to one another – or by steel pipes, which he toarranges in serial or geometric systems.

They have a single daughter, Caroline, for whom they have little affection, and two grandchildren, Corentin and Anthony. However, they seem closer to Anthony. Their main character trait is gratuitous malice towards their family or neighbors, often to kill time while they feel bored at home since they retired. Huguette is an ex-housewife, a bad cook, who spends her time at the market listening to Francoise's gossip, peeling vegetables or knitting in front of television with Raymond. Raymond is a retired gendarme (French police officer). Raymond never misses an opportunity to make fun of Huguette's cooking. Raymond nicknames Huguette \\"Ma Poule\\" (\\"My honey bun\\" in English). The couple has founded a small association with friends, the FLV (Front of liberation of old), with which they federate only six members, but intend well to rise in power to obtain a power of pressure on the decisions of the municipality and on the young people of the square, their worst enemies. The couple's daily life often comes down to doing bad things and getting rid of mischief. In appearance, they hate each other, but they often combine their efforts to make life impossible for their neighbors, street passers, and sometimes even their friends and family as well as their own daughters. They are also used to spying nearby neighbors with a pair of binoculars and ransacking their mail as well as funeral fun for their friends. They have their little habits that they would not change under any circumstances. Nevertheless, even if they will probably never admit it, they love each other deeply and could do nothing without each other. Liliane and José At the beginning of the series, they have been married for more than twenty years but have at least twenty-five years of common life behind them. They have a son, Emmanuel, called \\"Manu\\", who left home to work in China. Liliane saw very badly the lack of her son. Liliane and José are learning to live as a couple. They live in a suburban residence. José is a boy often anguished, lazy, rather primitive, but very nice who works in the service \\"Sport and youth\\" of the municipality of his city then mayor (from season 9). One of his characteristics is his ability to ask strange questions at the wrong time, which occupies him for several hours. He tries to develop inventions but they still lack elements, as Liliane regularly points out. José is obsessed by his rivalry with a co-worker, Chamard, who is José's \\"enemy\\" who does everything to be better than him. Liliane is beautician. She is desperate to see her husband lack depth, real attention and psychology to him, to slouch in front of football games, which he is great amateur. Liliane tries to rekindle the romance by erotic games that often turn out badly because of Jose's clumsiness. Liliane is obsessed with her son Manu, refusing to resolve to throw his old business. Liliane suffers from gambling addiction, is a good cook, passionate about Lady Di, and loves plants, which she treats like her children by talking to them. They often invite their neighbors and acquaintances to dinner, but the evenings often end badly because of Jose's lack of tact. Marion and Cedric Marion and Cedric, in their thirties, share a studio flat. Their love life lasts two years at the beginning of the series. Cedric is responsible for the crisis management of an Indian company until the beginning of season 8, when he finds himself in the closet and then on short-time work. It is grown and often made known, which annoys Marion. He has a beautiful image of himself, likes to look often in the bathroom mirror and enjoys clothes and chic objects. Cedric practices martial arts. He is a very serious and attentive person but extremely maniac Marion deplores. He also tries to convince Marion to have a child. He assumes all expenses of the couple and is also very stingy, ready to do anything to spend the least money possible. Before, Marion was a temporary worker. Currently, she resumes her psychology studies. She is very jealous, lazy, narrow-minded, lying, bad- tempered, expensive and sometimes she is very stupid and uneducated, manipulative, and bad-tempered. Marion thinks she is a pop talent and participates in Internet auctions. When she makes mistakes, she always looks for an excuse where blames Cedric. She has a strong character and is quite carefree, she often acts as she sees fit, and never leaves herself to come to blows as at her wedding. Starting in season 7, Marion has her own event company, M Company, which is very successful and brings in a lot of money. They nickname each other \\"poussin\\" (\\"little honey bun\\" in English). Their project is to go around the world in seasons 1 to 6. Their main feature is to argue for nothing and to be reconciled thanks to nothing; they are very complicit and have a lot of fun together. They often complain about the small size of their studio, and since Marion agreed to make a child with Cedric, she does not stop believing that he is sterile. They often invite their friends and often organize original and lively parties in their studio, or on the terrace of their building. Emma and Fabien They met in a gym while Fabien was stuck under dumbbells. Emma found it very clumsy but especially very funny. These two city-dwellers, who are opposed to each other, have moved into the countryside by retyping the old barn of Father Bergounioux, who later became their neighbor, to make them their home. Overwhelmed with debt, they have to organize their new life with their daughter Chloé. The couple call each other \\"chaton\\" (\\"kitten\\" in English). Emma is a saleswoman at Bricoflex, a DIY store, and she desperately tries to find a talent in the field of pottery, then militant singing and painting. Fabien never fails to remind him how bad it is in these areas. She happens to be passionate about her job, knowing how to handle all the tools, and takes care of the various maintenance of the house. Moreover, she transforms their garden into an artistic dump composed of odds and ends for reuse. Emma has a strong character and gets upset quickly. She also has a particular humor that Fabien seldom understands. Although she loves her daughter a lot, Emma easily pricks her nerves (during which she does not fail to insult Chloe, which Fabien can not bear) when she refuses to sleep, for example. Fabien is a history-geography professor. He is passionate about motocross, author of a herbarium and recent volunteer firefighter who is often anxious, especially when talking to him about the future of his daughter. A simple rise of stress or emotional shock, even insignificant, is enough to make him faint. Fabien is a hyper-sensitive man and often too caring for his daughter. Unlike Emma, Fabien is doing extremely poorly in the DIY field. For some time, Fabien has a balding start and is trying to find ways to fix it, but that is ruined by Emma's remarks. Camille and Philippe Camille and Philippe have the particularity of being almost twenty years apart (Camille's father is 5 years older than Philippe). They met in the Philip’s pharmacy. Philippe is a pharmacist who earns a lot of money, and likes to let others know. He is very afraid of being left by Camille and wants to constantly prove to him that he loves her, by doing diets and sports to improve his physical condition. However, he likes to cook a lot and enjoys gourmet cuisine. He owns a yacht and several real estate properties, including a studio occupied by Stephanie, Camille's swept friend who does not pay his rent. He has two children from his union with his ex-wife Isabelle. His son Ulysse, is a sluggish student, constantly reorienting himself, and not really knowing what he wants to do, he completely accepts the union of his father with Camille, and is also very complicit with the latter, he regularly asks for financial support from his father for the most insane projects. Camille, a yoga teacher, strives to be positive all the time. She has had a lot of adventures with people her age but she finds them too superficial, yet she advises Philippe to help her stay young and avoid her following outdated trends. She says she loves everyone, and has had a lot of conquests, including girls. She has a strange logic that she is the only one to understand and is extremely frank. She does not know how to lie and does not care about the consequences of her words. Unlike Philippe, she is very careful about what she eats and does a lot of sport. She is very sociable and empathetic and displays a very spiritual side. Leslie and Léo Léo and Leslie, lovers for 1 year decide to settle in a kind of warehouse furnished with the means of the edge. Leo and Leslie are very attached to new technologies that punctuate their lives. Their opposition is also based mainly on Leo's clichés about people living in the suburbs and Leslie's about the children of the rich. They also have their joint venture of customizing t-shirts.

Each car contained ten roomettes and six double bedrooms. Union Pacific sold several to the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (the \\"Milwaukee Road\\") in the late 1960s; Amtrak purchased most of the fleet in the early 1970s. Several remain in use as business cars.  Design  After World War II the 10-roomette 6-double bedroom (colloquially the \\"10-6 sleeper\\") design proved popular in the United States, with 682 such cars manufactured. All fifty Pacific series cars were built on Budd lot number 9660.039, and allocated Pullman Plan 9522. In this design the ten roomettes were numbered 1-10 and split down the middle by a hallway, while all six double bedrooms (designated A-F) were off to one side. A bathroom and porter's room were located across from each other at the vestibule end of the car. The car sides were corrugated instead of smooth, which was uncommon for Union Pacific equipment.  Service history  Budd delivered the fifty cars between December 1949 and June 1950; the \\"largest class of sleepers on the Union Pacific rails.\\" The Union Pacific used the Pacific series on various overnight streamliners in the 1950s and 1960s. One car, Pacific Empire, was written off after a rear-end collision at Wyuta, Wyoming in November 1951. The Milwaukee Road purchased five from the Union Pacific in June 1969 in order to equalise the per diem payments on their jointly-operated Overland Route passenger services. The final iteration of the Union Pacific's \\"City of Everywhere\\" (the joint operation of the Challenger, City of Denver, City of Los Angeles, City of Portland, and City of San Francisco) included four Pacific-series sleeping cars, three from the Union Pacific and one from the Milwaukee Road. Between 1971–1974 Amtrak purchased 43 of the remaining 44 Pacific-series cars from the Union Pacific fleet. Most were retired from service in the mid-1990s; several Amtrak rebuilt as crew dormitory cars and those remained in service into the 2000s. One, Pacific Cape, remains in use as a business car. The Union Pacific retained Pacific Domain, renamed Cabarton, as a staff car. The Milwaukee Road's five cars were all sold to Mexico in 1971 and 1972.

Beginning around 2011, women in the West began to consider the thigh gap a special feature of female physical attractiveness. Although some men regard it as a sign of physical fitness, the thigh gap has been associated with femininity and fragility. In the United States, it was reported that among teenage girls, a gap had become a beauty ideal. Many women have found it difficult to achieve a thigh gap, leading some to resort to extreme dieting or even surgery in order to try to obtain it. Critics of the craze have pointed out that the thigh gap is a physiognomic feature natural only for women with a certain type of body shape and bone structure that most women do not have. Experts say that attempts to attain the unattainable ideal result in problems of self-esteem that can lead to eating disorders. Origin of the phenomenon The thigh gap received widespread news coverage in December 2012 after the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show which featured several models with noticeable thigh gaps. Images of thigh gaps featured in \\"thinspiration\\" blogs and across social networking sites. Backlash In 2013, author Camille Hugh published her book The Thigh Gap Hack, Review of . and in June 2013 she was interviewed about the book on The Dr. Oz Show. The book was criticized by Lisa Delaney of Spryliving.com, who said the book \\"feeds girls' and women's obsessions with their bodies, promotes thinness at the expense of healthfulness (because of Hugh's disdain of fitness, exercise, muscles, etc.), and promotes flaky, unproven methods for weight/fat loss.\\" A backlash quickly developed amongst those concerned about the potential negative consequences of the trend. Parenting experts and counselors formed anti-thigh gap movements. The medical community and female- empowerment advocates have also commented critically on the subject, and the U.S. National Eating Disorders Association launched a website to promote healthy body image and attitudes to food and weight. Australian plus-size model Robyn Lawley criticized the thigh gap trend, denouncing it as \\"just another tool of manipulation that other people are trying to use to keep me from loving my body\\". Target Corporation apologized after Cassey Ho discovered that a photo of a model had a photoshopped thigh gap for a girl's bathing suit ad. Old Navy came under criticism by bloggers after a photo of a mannequin wearing women's plus-size jeans on their website appeared to have a small thigh gap placed so that the jeans on the mannequin would look thinner than they would look on an actual person. Old Navy subsequently stated that they do not use any photo-editing techniques to alter the apparent shape of their products, but they do sometimes use pins on clothing to adjust how it fits a mannequin. Media comment The thigh gap has also spawned opinions from newspapers. The Times of India called it \\"mania\\". Columnist Kelly Richardson of the Sacramento Bee wrote that \\"for most people it is next to impossible to attain\\". In The Observer journalist Rosie Swash called the thigh gap \\"widespread, harmful and often unachievable\\". Columnist Hadley Freeman called it the \\"most extreme body fixation yet\\". Geneticist Sylvia Pagán Westphal was inspired to write an opinion piece on the thigh gap after her daughter brought the trend to her attention and was appalled by the results of her Google search for the term. San Jose State University sociologist Natalie Boero has attributed the trend to living in a \\"sexist and sizeist culture\\" and clinical psychologist Barbara Greenberg has dismissed the trend as a \\"pipe dream\\", adding \\"most women are not built that way to have that space between their thighs\\".

Weinstein found varieties of pandeism in the religious views held in China, especially with respect to Taoism as expressed by Lao-Tze.Max Bernhard Weinstein, Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis (\\"World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature\\") (1910), page 234-235: \\"Pandeistische Andeutungen finden sich selbstverständlich auch bei vielen anderen Völkern.

Pandeism in India alt=Painting depicting a multi-armed, multi-headed being– Krishna displays his Vishvarupa (Universal Form) to Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra (chapter 11). In 1833, religionist Godfrey Higgins theorized in his Anacalypsis that \\"Pandeism was a doctrine, which had been received both by Buddhists and Brahmins.\\" In 1896, historian Gustavo Uzielli described the world's population as influenced \\"by a superhuman idealism in Christianity, by an anti-human nihilism in Buddhism, and by an incipient but growing pandeism in Indian Brahmanism.\\" But the following year, the Reverend Henry Grattan Guinness wrote critically that in India, \\"God is everything, and everything is God, and, therefore, everything may be adored. ... Her pan-deism is a pandemonium.\\"Henry Grattan Guinness, \\"First Impressions of India,\\" in John Harvey Kellogg, and the International Health and Temperance Association's, The Medical Missionary (1897), pages 125-127. Likewise, twenty years earlier, in 1877, Peruvian scholar and historian Carlos Wiesse Portocarrero had written in an essay titled Philosophical Systems of India that in that country, \\"Metaphysics is pandeistic and degenerates into idealism.\\"Carlos Wiesse Portocarrero, Sistemas filosóficos de la India (Philosophical Systems of India), November 1877, Part V: \\"Metafísica es pandeista y degenera en el idealismo.\\" German physicist-philosopher Max Bernhard Weinstein also found Pandeism to be prevalent in India, especially in the Hindu Bhagavad Gita. In 2014, German political philosopher Jürgen Hartmann observed that Hindu pandeism (along with vegetarianism) has contributed to friction with monotheistic Islam. In 2019, Swiss thinker James B. Glattfelder wrote that \\"in Hinduism, the notion of lila is akin to the concept of pandeism\\".James B. Glattfelder, Information—Consciousness—Reality: How a New Understanding of the Universe Can Help Answer Age-Old Questions of Existence (2019), p. 534. Within non-dualist philosophical schools of Indian philosophy, Lila is a way of describing all reality, including the cosmos, as the outcome of creative play by the divine absolute (Brahman). In the dualistic schools of Vaishnavism, Lila refers to the activities of God and his devotee, as well as the macrocosmic actions of the manifest universe, as seen in the Vaishnava scripture Srimad Bhagavatam, verse 3.26.4:Vedabase entry SB 3.26.4 Pandeism elsewhere in Asia Yamazaki Ansai, identified by Max Bernhard Weinstein as a philosopher with ideas especially consonant with pandeism. Weinstein similarly found the views of 17th century Japanese Neo-Confucian philosopher Yamazaki Ansai, who espoused a cosmology of universal mutual interconnectedness, to be especially consonant with pandeism.Max Bernhard Weinstein, Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis (\\"World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature\\") (1910), page 235: \\"Von den Japanern soll einer ihrer bedeutendsten Philosophen, Yamazaki-Ansai, um die mitte des siebzehnten Jahrhunderts, entwickelt haben: “Gott ist das Wesen aller Dinge und durchdringt den Himmel und die Erde.” Das klingt pandeistisch, kann jedoch auch metaphorisch gemeint sein, wie wir ja ähnliche Aussprüche von Gott tun. Because cosmologically everything was interconnected, Ansai believed that the actions of an individual (in a similar manner to modern chaos theory) affect the entire universe. He stressed the Confucian concept of Great Learning, in which a person's actions (the center of a series of concentric circles) extend outward toward the family, society, and finally to the cosmos. Charles Anselm Bolton, a former Catholic priest who left the Catholic Church to teach Reformation doctrines, alluded to Pandeism in Asia in a 1963 article, Beyond the Ecumenical: Pan-deism?, published in Christianity Today, an Evangelical Christian magazine founded by the Reverend Billy Graham.Charles Anselm Bolton, \\"Beyond the Ecumenical: Pan-deism?\\", Christianity Today, 1963, page 21. In the article, Bolton addressed the role of Asia in the relationship between Christianity and pandeism, contending that the Catholic Church intended to use pandeism as a sort of umbrella belief system under which to bring religions of Asia toward Catholicism. Bolton notes that \\"To those familiar with the history of Roman Catholic missions in recent centuries, the idea of fraternization with oriental religions is not completely new,\\" and that \\"to unite with Hindus and Buddhists, Christians should explore the hidden reality—the “ultimate reality,” the infinite, the absolute, the everlasting, the all-pervading spirit that marks the religious experience of the Orient.\\" NotesSee also * Lila (Hinduism) * Tat Tvam Asi External links *Pandeism in Hinduism by Robert G.

Originally written for and recorded by a small electro-acoustic ensemble in 2010, the piece was reworked for full orchestra in 2012 with the assistance of American conductor-composer Thomas A. Blomster, and was performed in Denver, Colorado, USA in April 2013. The original electro-acoustic small-group version was released as Reuter's Todmorden 513 album on the Hyperfunction label in 2011. The 2013 orchestral version has been recorded and released on the 7D Media label. Background In 2011, Markus Reuter was best known as an experimental rock musician, but he was also a classically trained musician who'd begun composing at the age of 11. Encouraged in his early composition efforts by his piano teacher Ulrich Pollmann, Reuter had gone on to study music history, theory and analysis with Karlheinz Straetmanns (a composer in the lineage of Harald Genzmer and Paul Hindemith).Markus Reuter official biography timeline 'Fifteen Questions with Markus Reuter' (interview on Fifteen Questions website) In 1996, while at university in Bielefield, Reuter studied permutation-based compositional principles with Daniel Schell, Indian music with Ashok Pathak and free improvisation with Gerd Lisken. In addition, he spent seven years between 1991 and 1998 as a student of Guitar Craft, studying with Robert Fripp, Tony Geballe and others. Other influences which inspired Reuter's compositional thinking included Olivier Messiaen, David Bedford, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Johann Sebastian Bach, Alban Berg, Anton Webern, Mike Oldfield, Ernst Krenek and the collaborations of George Gurdjieff and Thomas de Hartmann. Reuter's subsequent work with ensembles and as a solo performer involved a wide spread of influences and musical factors including generative music. From 2005 onwards, Reuter's interest in generative music came to the fore in his work with the experimental rock band Tuner and also informed the harmonic designs of a new piece which would become \\"Todmorden 513\\".Biography on 'Todmorden 513' microsite Composition and musical style \\"Todmorden 513\\" was developed using an algorithmic combinatorial compositional technique devised by Reuter, which generates a continuous movement and sequence of 513 harmonies and triads.Iapetus Media press release for Todmorden 513 The piece uses mathematical function and feedback loops modulated by processes, inspired by the cells of living organisms (Reuter has cited the shapes of leaves as an example).Three Pieces feature on Markus Reuter\\"Markus Reuter: Piece 2: Todmorden 513\\" (Three Pieces YouTube feature) The original press release for the composition explains that \\"the notes of each harmony or triad is then fed back into the same algorithm, resulting in a progression of chords and note clusters of highly-varied density, ranging from simple two- note harmonies to dense twelve-note chords spread across several octaves. Starting on an A flat, the sequences of pitches form a kind of melodic or thematic line throughout. The rhythms of the performing instrumental trios and quartets are derived from the chord sequences themselves, which are looped across the whole piece, mapped to the notes of each chord, then mixed together. From there it is split into three or four independent voices respectively. The result is a shifting set of harmonic densities — at times quite spare — ranging from a harmony of two instruments to other moments of thick and lush instrumentation.\\" Musicologist Dr. Mary C. Jungerman (who also performed in the piece's orchestral premiere) has noted that Reuter's compositional approach \\"follows in the long lineage of German musical organization from Bach through Beethoven, Brahms and Schoenberg and is also strongly reminiscent of the highly serialized compositions of Karlheinz Stockhausen.\\"Dr. Mary C. Jungerman's musical analysis of \\"Todmorden 513\\" Reuter himself describes the piece as \\"completely deterministic\\" and the result of attempting to create \\"a new sound world\\" by recombining pitches. He has cited the work of Olivier Messiaen as the main inspiration for his approach and has also expressed his belief that old and new musical systems need to be reconciled and integrated for future composition: \\"I believe that to create a new sound, normative or deterministic properties of older classical music from the Baroque era or Classical era or the Romantic era need to make a return in a big way. We’ve had 50 years - 60 years - of chaos, of experimentation, but there is a natural limit to what you can discover with experimentation because we're humans: we need some kind of a system, we need rules in order to come up with new ideas. If we are open to starting to use old knowledge, and accepting old knowledge as something valuable, and also using the new technologies, and we combine that - we come into a new world where knowledge counts again. Now is the time to start being open to combining the old and the new...as simple as that.\\" Title and interpretation The title of the piece is pronounced \\"Todmorden five-thirteen\\"Markus Reuter interview on 'More Gilles' program, Colorado Public Radio, April 16, 2013 (text and content from audio broadcast) and juxtaposes the number of compositional elements used within the piece with the name of a small English market town in West Yorkshire, seventeen miles northeast of Manchester. Reuter was interested by the sinister Germanic implications of the Todmorden placename when he first encountered it (in German,\\"tod\\" means \\"death\\" and \\"morden\\" means \\"to murder\\") and used it to illustrate his own reflections on individual interpretation. In an interview with Colorado Public Radio, Reuter explained that \\"it's part of my understanding of the world that the impression that something gives you is not necessarily what it is, or means. Especially if you're speaking different languages you kind of start to realise that a lot of what we experience is so coloured – obviously coloured by our language, coloured by our culture, coloured by our expectations. And this word was just an extreme illustration for me of how differently human beings experience the same thing.\\" He went on to note that “Todmorden 513” fits into this concept because it is \\"designed (composed) in such a way that it offers a different kind of emotional experience for every listener.\\" Original ensemble recording \\"Todmorden 513\\" was originally written and recorded for a small electro-acoustic ensemble featuring various overdubbed electric and acoustic guitars, string quartet, recorder, organ, synthesizer, glockenspiel and electronics. The young Swiss composer Tobias Reber and the engineer-musician Philipp Quaet-Faslem assisted Reuter in the electronic realisation of the piece, and were credited as \\"assistant composers\\" on the original release. Reuter released this recording on his own Hyperfunction label at the beginning of 2011. Orchestral version In the spring of 2012 Reuter streamed his recording of \\"Todmorden 513\\" on Facebook and asked for assistance in creating an orchestral version. American conductor and composer Thomas A. Blomster (the director of the Colorado Chamber Orchestra) responded, and began working with Reuter on a full orchestral score.Thomas A. Blomster: 'Welcome' (Todmorden blog) In January 2013, Reuter visited Blomster in Denver, Colorado and the two men worked with the Colorado Chamber Orchestra on a read-through of the initial draft score. Blomster's new orchestration involved a large orchestra with a substantial percussion section (including chimes, \\"huge sleigh bells\\" and even a wind machine) plus a \\"large contingent\\" of wind instruments as well as strings. Jungerman has commented \\"this orchestration brings out the melodic dimension of the piece as it is passed from instrument to instrument in ever- changing colors, reminding one strongly of the Klangfarbenmelodie techniques of Berg and Webern early in the 20th century.\\" Both Reuter and Blomster have labelled the new version of \\"Todmorden 513\\" as a concerto for orchestra. Blomster: \\"There are fifty unique parts or musical lines, one per musician with very little duplication. Each of these parts are solo parts, and demand absolute precision and discipline on the part of each individual performer. At the same time, each part/performer is a part of either a trio or quartet, demanding sensitive chamber playing from the musicians. Finally, each individual musician and trio or quartet are part of the large orchestra that is created by combining the smaller groups together. Markus and I chose not to put any dynamic markings in the score; so the final demand on the orchestra musicians is that they balance themselves, so a tuba or trumpet player must be aware not to overpower a single violin playing their individual part.\\"Thomas A. Blomster: 'More News & Thoughts' (Todmorden blog) Reuter has also stressed the psychological component of the piece, in performance. \\"When Thomas Blomster and I worked on the orchestration for \\"Todmorden 513\\" (we) were looking for a word to summarize the way each part should be played by each instrumentalist. Eventually we came up with the word \\"normal\\", which surprised us, but that's really how musical pieces should be performed - at the very least when in the process of getting to know the music.\\" The orchestral version of \\"Todmorden 513\\" was premiered by the Colorado Chamber Orchestra on April 18, 2013 in a concert at the King Center Concert Hall, Auraria Campus, Denver, Colorado. The piece was the second of two compositions played at the concert, the other being Gregory T.S. Walker's Global Solstice which was played as the concert opener.DMA Music report on \\"Todmorden 513\\" concertOpusColorado reports \\"Todmorden 513\\" premiere, April 12, 2013 Recordings=Original electro-acoustic version Album notes from discogs.comFurther album notes from discogs.com =Track listing=Personnel= Performers: *Markus Reuter – U8 Touch Guitar, electric guitar, acoustic guitar, synthesizer, organ, glockenspiel, electronics *Tobias Reber - electronics *Karina Bellmann, Uta Maria Lempert - violins *Wiebke Tschöpe – viola *Juliane Gilbert – cello *Ulrich Pollmann – recorder *Frieder Zimmermann – sustainer guitar Other personnel: *Markus Reuter - producer *Bernhard Wöstheinrich, Markus Reuter – executive producers *Ritxi Ostáriz - art direction, designArtwork at ritxiostariz.com *Henry Warwick - liner notes *Robert Rich - mixing *Andreu Balius - typography Orchestral version Following their 2013 premiere concert performance of the orchestral version of \\"Todmorden 513\\", the Colorado Chamber Orchestra made a studio recording.

Noboa y Caamaño came from a wealthy family in Guayaquil, and was always plagued by a neuroses that only morphine could temporarily cure. He sought to ameliorate his mental condition by traveling to Europe, but no matter what he tried, he felt hopelessly lost, and without spirit to overcome the loneliness of this world. His poetry, coated with unmatched delicacy and perfection, shows the influence of Samain, Verlaine and Baudelaire. Almost all of his work, marked by anxiety and loathing, was collected in a book titled \\"Romanza de las Horas\\" (Romance of the Hours), published in 1922. For some, his poem \\"Emoción vesperal\\" (Vesperal Emotion) marked a new era of poetry in Ecuador. He is one of the most read poets in Ecuador, and many of his poems are recited and sung by the people. He also wrote some works of criticism.Biografía de Noboa y Caamaño, Ernesto (1889-1927) The Decapitated Generation The \\"Generación decapitada\\" (Decapitated Generation) was a literary group formed by four young Ecuadorian poets in the first decades of the 20th century. Two men from Guayaquil, Medardo Ángel Silva and Ernesto Noboa y Caamaño, and two men from Quito, Arturo Borja and Humberto Fierro, were the precursors of modernismo in Ecuador. These four writers were greatly influenced by the modernist movement of Rubén Darío and by 19th-century French romantic poetry. They all read this poetry in the original language, by authors including Baudelaire, Hugo, Rimbaud, and Verlaine. This group is called \\"decapitada\\", or decapitated, because all of them committed suicide at a young age. Though they knew each other and dedicated poems to each other, they never met together to create a true literary group. The term \\"generación decapitada\\" originated in the middle of the 20th century, when Ecuadorian journalists and historians decided to name them, noting similarities in the authors' poetry.

From the 2000s until his death, he was a controversial figure in the eyes of the public and fought against opponents of homosexuality and homosexual psychopath theorists. Throughout his school years, he had been pushed away from a similar peer group. In December 2002, he planned to leave school in order to attend Seil High School. From 1999 to 2003, he was active in the anti-LGBT discrimination movement, the LGBT rights movement, and homophobia opposition movement. In 2001, he debuted in literary world, involving himself in poetry, writing and columnist activities also, but mainly poetry. He received much discrimination and was the victim of prejudice, because of his sexual identity. In 2002, he joined the Solidarity for LGBT Human Rights of Korea, and was also a peace activist and a conscientious objector to military service. Up until his death, he wrote more poetry and prose, but his work was rejected, as he was gay. After 2000 he was involved in a LGBT human rights, anti-discrimination, disability rights, and an anti-war peace movement. On April 26, 2003, Yun drank two Korean distilled spirits and hanged himself,10대 동성애자 '사회적 차별비관' 자살 한겨레 2003.04.28 as a result of the homophobia and closed-mindedness in South Korea. Because of his death, obscene words against homosexual and transgender individuals were revoked and protection was somewhat implemented through the South Korean Youth Protection Act (청소년 보호법청소년유해매체물에 '동성애' 삭제키로 Ohmynews 2003.04.29 ).

He awoke to his sexual identity during his time in middle school. He was recognized for his sexual identity problems, and as a result of this, he was picked on.죽음으로 마감한 ‘커밍아웃’ The Sisajournal 2003.05.15 Later he was excluded by his peer group and his neighbourhood due to discrimination. On October 8, 2002, he was sent to a psychiatric clinic by his family, despite his emphatic claims that he was not a psychopath. He was dependent on green tea, rosary, tobacco, alcohol, foundation and hypnotics, which became known metaphorically as his \\"six friends\\" as Korean writer Kwak Byong-chan was based on his one nickname Yook Woo-dang,지상에 천국을 일군 한 동성애인의 꿈 Hangyeorye 2013.05.21 which also means \\"six friends\\" in the Korean language. In his last years of life, it was Yun's favorite phrase for the majority of his activity and content, and was used as a signature. His family disapproved of his homosexuality and pressured him to be heterosexual, but Yun said, \\"I can't be heterosexual and don't want to be heterosexual.\\" He was thoroughly isolated, about which he would complain in his diary. In October 2002, one diary entry from Yun said, \\"I do not think I'm abnormal. In this world born and living right-handed, also naturally left-handed is born and living. This road exists as also another road exists. Most persons use the well-worn path, but I have to go on a lone desolate path.\\" He enjoyed reading, The Diary of Anne Frank and Thus Spoke Zarathustra.  Poetry and writings  During his adolescence, he tried to drown his pain in writing and also went to volunteer in orphanages and disabled groups. Some famous quotes from his works include the following: : \\"The world is hatred to like monster for we / So we living lurking place here and there / do you know, but this we is one of human. (Complain)“동성애는 사람이 사람 좋아하는 문제… 이상한가요” The Seoulnews 2013-04-23, 29 \\" : \\"Before you say, going to heaven to believe in Jesus Christ/ Pastor! begin with you first conduct. / after death, you when excuse see to Jesus?(one Pastor)10년전 기독 청소년 ‘육우당’이 왜 목을 맨 지 아십니까? 미디어오늘 2013.04.27 \\" Another famous poem by Yun, \\"Reborn\\", reads: : \\"My soul was transform for the flower rain / after I went to your side / You are so insensibility to this me / Dear You please listen to My sweet soft whisper.\\" Yun hinted of the censorship present in South Korean society through his many works and stories. He often embedded satire within his poems, prose, novels and social criticism, yet still sang softly about love. After completing elementary school, Yun wrote poetry and prose, but the majority of his work was given the notoriety to not be seen or read, due to his sexual identity. In his writings, he openly confessed his disappointment in prejudices and conventions, superstition and the remnants of blind faith, and the tradition of clinging to old customs, which strongly dominated the lives of many in South Korea. : \\"Possibly before die, never I will not get a good evaluation eponymous poet. A heterosexual and asceticism and moralism, formalism aim for this society, because I am only just heretic and deviants.\\" He harbored ill feelings towards South Korean political leaders due to the institutionalized homophobia rampant in South Korea, and because the majority of South Korean political figures were opposed to homosexuality, feeling that it violated traditional social norms and values. He was deeply upset by the assertion by political figures that his work violated traditional Korean social mores, due to the conservative attitudes prevalent in South Korean society.  LGBT rights movement  From March 1, 2000, he attended Seil High-school in Bupyeong-gu. However, in December 2002, he dropped out of high school. After leaving school, he moved to the Dongdaemun District in Seoul and became involved in the literary and LGBT activist scene. Due to the widespread criticism of the homosexual themes in his writings, especially by fundamental Christians, he was unable to write under his real name despite wanting to do so.[특집 차별금지법 논란‘차별의 범위’에 무슨 내용 담겼길래?] wikly Kyonghyang 1024 교회는 성(性)소수자를 향한 차별과 혐오에 침묵할 것인가?

South Korean LGBT Flag After the year 2000, Yun objected to the theory that HIV and related infections are directly transmitted by homosexuals, who were considered to be vectors for the virus. In his objection, he stated that the theory was a groundless assumption. Early on in the movement, he was a person who persuaded people that homophobia was unacceptable and fought against discriminatory objections to homosexuality on the internet. In January 2002, he became a long-distance activist. In January 2001, he joined the D Sijo(시조 詩調) poet club and W Sijo poet club, with a rank as a student member. He continued his activity and contributed many writings, including poetry, to Sijo for a period of two years. In February 2001, he joined and later worked for the organization Solidarity for LGBT Human Rights of Korea.또 한 명의 게이가 자살하기를 바라는 건가 medias 2010.11.02 He also became a conscientious objector to Korea's conscription military service. Yun emphasised that viewing homosexuality as sinful and denying acceptance for homosexuals as 'children of God' is wrong, whereas some Conservative Christian groups' ideology viewed it as anti-biblical activity.한 동성애자의 죽음을 통한 절규 인권운동사랑방 No.2325, 2003.04.29 In autumn of 2002, Yun sought after more volunteers or full-time employees for the Solidarity for LGBT Human Rights of Korea. His earnest desires were approved for March of the following year.  Other activity  In January 2003, he was hired to work in a gay bar in Gangnam-gu, Seoul. However, due to anxiety, he soon retired from the job. Afterwards, parallel with several part- time jobs, he committed to become a civil and human rights activist. On March 24, 2003, he became a full-time employee of Solidarity for LGBT Human Rights of Korea. He participated in media censorship-opposition movements. Yun was repetitively insistent, particularly with some South Koreans who were intent on trampling many artists, entertainers and writers, even though pop culture was fresh with a variety of creativity and various artists. They were condemned in the name of morals and ethics. Yun was an LGBT rights activist, and during this time participated in the abolition movement of LGBT and LGBT related media which was regarded as \\"youth Harmful media specified\\"(청소년 유해 매체). At the same time, he always attended anti-war and peace rallies in Jongro, Seoul. Slowly, he became the leading representative in anti-war and peace movements as a guest speaker. Additionally, he participated in an opposition campaign in Seoul which aimed to prevent the government from sending troops overseas to participate in the Iraq war. On April 3, he was a determined participant in the Conscientious objection to military service(양심적 병역 거부). Yun declared his refusal the wholesale slaughter of innocent peoples. Also, he participated in the sex worker rights movement and antidiscrimination movements, sex workers discrimination opposition movements. also with joint to Ableism objection movements.  Conflict with fundamentalist Christianity  South Korean fundamentalist Christians and some South Korean Christian denominations hated on homosexuality. For a long time, fundamentalist Christians and some Christian denominations believed that homosexuals and transgender individuals were \\"crazy\\". In the year 2000, Yun disputed with them. Yun insisted that homosexuality was not a mental illness and that it was personal taste. Although Yun was a devout Catholic, there was an immense amount of criticism by Christianity on homosexuality. It is known that he largely despaired.소년의 자살 10년 지났지만…동성애 따가운 시선은 여전 The Hangyeorye 2013.04.24 On April 2, 2003, the South Korean National Human Rights Commission of Korea Association made a formal announcement that the LGBT and LGBT-related media regarded as \\"youth Harmful media specified\\" was human rights abuse.신앙인의 고뇌 담은 동성애자 이야기 발간 가톨릭뉴스 지금여기 2010.12.08 He was welcoming and at the same time condemning of some of the more Christian groups, while government agencies instigated that there was sexual corruption. Yun debated them by setting forth counterarguments and objections to contribute to daily newspapers. Two day later, some South Korean conservative Christian groups said, \\"Sodom and Gomorrah was destroyed to the wrath of God for judgment of sulfur, sexual depravity because homosexuals. the Bible strictly forbids homosexuality. Commission has to withdraw the decision.\\"; they argued that homosexuality disrupted the natural order and caused HIV infection.동성애자 천주교 형제의 죽음, 그후 6년 변한 건 없다 오마이뉴스 2010.04.22 On April 7, he said: \\"Homosexuals is one of people, ye is dangerous psychopath also see to one of Human, anyway ye is Homosexuals is only see to non-human animals, demons?\\" He vigorously protested, but his objections were viewed to still not be acceptable, so on April 13 he made a real name contribution to Hnagyeorye:동성애자도 인권 존중해야 약자희생 모는 편견 곤란 Hangyeorye 2003.04.13 On April 11, he withdrew from Catholic society, causing a backlash of Christian fundamentalist homophobia, which was later taken back in the following two days. Afterwards, he prayed daily, with a desire for homosexuals to not be discriminated by his God. Yun Hyon-seok was determined to commit suicide from this point, due to the anger and hatred against many homosexual Christians.  Death and commemoration  In April 2003, Hyon-seok and other human-rights activists were making preparations for a May Day meeting. For a long time, he was a devout Christian, despite the criticism from other Christians because of his sexual identity. Yun had been disappointed for a long time, but he was devoted to his religion. He had immediately suffered homosexual discrimination and contempt.
