French DVD cover for a Thierry Le Luron compilation.  Early life  Born in Paris, France, to Francis Le Luron (1926-2012), and Huguette Gousserey (1922-2009). Debut In 1969, when Thierry Le Luron was a 17-year-old student at the Lyc√©e Emmanuel-Mounier in Ch√¢tenay-Malabry, he and his friends created a band called \\"Les rats crev√©s\\" (\\"The Dead Rats\\") and performed a few gigs in the Hauts-de-Seine region. The band debuted in several Parisian cabarets, including L'Echelle de Jacob. Le Luron was featured on 4 January 1970 on the game show \\"Le jeu de la chance,\\" a segment of the TV show T√©l√© Dimanche. He won six consecutive times, first singing classic tunes before choosing to devote himself to imitation. He performed his first sketches on the same program, including the 1 February 1970 (imitation Adamo) and 15 February 1970 editions, even on the anniversary of Jean Nohain, when he sang for Prime Minister Jacques Chaban-Delmas and Jean Nohain. In 1971, Le Luron released his first album, Le Minist√®re patraque (\\"The Ministry out of sorts\\"), which became very popular. He gave his first performance as an actor in Bobino between February and March 1972 and opened for the Claude Fran√ßois tour in the summer of 1972. Success From November 1972 to July 1973, Le Luron hosted his first show, \\"Le Luron du dimanche\\" (\\"Le Luron on Sunday\\"), on the first channel of ORTF. It was created the same year as his new show was premiered at the Th√©√¢tre des Vari√©t√©s. Thierry Le Luron performed every evening with some of his friends, his last acts were poignant. The band \\"Le Luron\\" included Jacques Collard, Jacques Pessis, Pierre Guillermo, Francis Diwo, Luc Fournol, and Bernard Mabille. The portraits, sketches and imitations were refined and gave birth to very elaborate performances at the Olympia (December 1976), Bobino (February-April 1978), Th√©√¢tre Marigny (October 1979 ‚Äì June 1980), Thierry F√©√©ries at the Palais des congr√®s de Paris (November 1980 ‚Äì January 1981), De de Gaulle √† Mitterrand at the Th√©√¢tre Marigny (January- December 1983), and Le Luron en libert√© at the Th√©√¢tre du Gymnase Marie Bell (November 1984 ‚Äì March 1986). The last show attracted about 400,000 viewers. He then worked mainly with Bernard Mabille and created the character of Adolphe Benito Glandu, caretaker at 22 Rue de Bi√®vre, a \\"fairly extensive caricature of the average Frenchperson: an individual with no particular equities, influenced by calamities, and that defines Le Luron: Petainist under P√©tain, Mendesist under Mend√®s France, and Socialist May 10 to 11!\\". He also pursued an intense activity on television and radio: Chat en poche by Georges Feydeau as part of the TV show Au th√©√¢tre ce soir (released 24 October 1975) and Num√©ro 1 by Maritie and Gilbert Carpentier (March 1976 and June 1979). From 1978 to 1979, he hosted a weekly show, Les Parasites sur l'antenne, on France Inter including Pierre Desproges, Lawrence Riesner, Bernard Mabille and Evelyne Grandjean as columnists. In 1981, he recorded the theme song of the animated television series Rody le petit Cid. Thierry Le Luron later imitated Gilbert B√©caud on the TV show Champs-Elysees on 10 November 1984, singing and blackmailing the public's ignorance, in a song titled \\"L'emmerdant, c'est la rose\\" (\\"The rose is what's annoying\\"), with the rose being the symbol of the Socialist Party dedicating this song to President Fran√ßois Mitterrand. On 25 September 1985, he \\"married\\" Coluche \\"for better or for laughter\\" (\\"pour le meilleur ou pour le rire,\\" a pun on the phrase \\"pour le meilleur ou pour le pire\\") to great fanfare in Montmartre. A few weeks later his \\"son,\\" played by Carlos was born. Le Luron said: \\"I wanted Coluche to be dressed by Pierre Cardin. But...for Mourousi's marriage, he has to make both dresses\\". This statement, and the false marriage itself, are often interpreted as a public act of vengeance, especially by Le Luron's friends, as most of the attention was focused on Coluche, although the press commended both of them for their outspokenness. Death and legacy Le Luron was diagnosed with cancer at the age of 34, and cancelled his scheduled appearances in December 1985. He died on 13 November 1986.

On 19 June 1946 transmitter Heusweiler went in service again.  Original transmitter  It used a t-aerial, which was up-hung on two 35 and 31 meters tall wooden towers. The Heusweiler transmitter was destroyed on March 17, 1945 by war damage. First a t-aerial was used, which was, in the same year, replaced by a 50 metre tall steel framework mast insulated against ground, which exists still today and serves as reserve antenna.  Replacement transmitters  In 1948, a 120 meter high steel framework mast insulated from ground was built in Heusweiler. In the following years, the transmitting power of the Heusweiler transmitter was steadily increased. In 1965, another radio mast with a height of 120 meters was built, and in 1973 the transmitting power was increased to 1200 kilowatts, with the power reduced to 600 kilowatts at night. The Heusweiler transmitter was thereby the most powerful medium wave transmitter in Germany, and the most powerful transmitter of the ARD. From 1973 to 1994 the Heusweiler transmitter transmitted the program of Europawelle Saar.  Current transmitter  Since 1994, the transmitter has been used for broadcasting the program of Deutschlandfunk. The transmitting power is permanently 600 kilowatts, however Deutschlandfunk closed down all its Medium Wave transmitters, including the Heusweiler radio transmitter on December 31, 2015. In order to prevent a disturbing influence on car electronics by the transmitter, a net of wires was hung over the A8 Autobahn near the transmitter. The Saarland Broadcasting plans to put a second medium-wave transmitter in Heusweiler in service for an information program in the day hours.

He signed into law a number of racial laws against Serbs, Jews, and Romani people, and was responsible for a string of concentration camps in which over 100,000 civilians were murdered and mistreated. He escaped to the United States after the war, where he lived until extradited to Yugoslavia in 1986.1986 extradition ruling, justia.com; accessed 10 February 2016. He was tried and found guilty of a number of mass killings in the NDH, and was sentenced to death, but the sentence was not carried out due to his age and health. He died in custody in 1988. Early life and career Andrija Artukoviƒá was born on 19 November 1899, in Klobuk, near Ljubu≈°ki in Austro- Hungarian-occupied Herzegovina to Marijan and Ru≈æa (n√©e Ra≈°iƒá) Artukoviƒá. He was one of 14 siblings raised on a farm. He studied at a Franciscan gymnasium (high school) run by the monastery in nearby ≈†iroki Brijeg, and obtained a doctorate in law from the University of Zagreb in 1924. From 1926 he was practising law in Gospiƒá in the Lika region of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Usta≈°e activities Artukoviƒá joined the Croatian nationalist and terrorist Usta≈°e organisation which had been formed in 1929 and in 1932, he was one of the organisers of their small Velebit uprising in Lika, which involved an attack on a Yugoslav gendarmerie station by a group of Usta≈°e. Artukoviƒá fled Yugoslavia before the uprising commenced, escaping via Rijeka to Venice on 31 August. On arrival in Italy, the poglavnik (supreme leader) of the Usta≈°e, Ante Paveliƒá, appointed Artukoviƒá as an adjutant to Main Usta≈°a Headquarters and commander of all Usta≈°e in Italy, and Artukoviƒá adopted the pseudonym \\"Had≈æija\\" (pilgrim). The uprising he helped organise was quickly and brutally suppressed by the Yugoslav authorities, which brought the Usta≈°e some public attention and prestige. In Italy, Artukoviƒá came into conflict with a group of supporters of fellow Usta≈°a Mijo Babiƒá (known as \\"Giovanni\\"). In late 1933, Artukoviƒá left the country. After that he went to Budapest then Vienna where he was arrested and briefly detained in March 1934 before being expelled from Austria. He returned to Budapest, then after meeting Paveliƒá in Milan in early October, he travelled to London. He was arrested there after the Usta≈°e assassination of the Yugoslav King Alexander I in Marseilles, France. After his arrest he was handed over to French authorities, and spent three months in a Paris prison. In January 1935 he was extradited to Yugoslavia, and after 16 months spent in prison in Belgrade, he was acquitted by the Court for the Protection of the State. He was released on 16 April 1936, and briefly returned to Gospiƒá before travelling to Austria in May. He later went to Germany, where he was involved in spreading Usta≈°e propaganda. In early 1937 he was living in Berlin when he was interrogated by the Gestapo, and under threat of arrest, he fled to France. This was followed by a stint in Budapest after which he returned to Berlin. By the late 1930s, the Usta≈°e had adopted the fascist principles of their financial backer and protector, Italy. Independent State of Croatia In late March 1941, Yugoslavia joined the Axis, but two days later, a pro-Allied coup d'√©tat overthrew the government that had signed the treaty. In response, Adolf Hitler decided to invade and dismember Yugoslavia. The German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in early April comprehensively defeated the Yugoslav military, and the country was divided up between the Axis powers. Before the Yugoslav government had capitulated, the Germans engineered the creation of the Independent State of Croatia, and placed Paveliƒá and the Usta≈°e in charge. Slavko Kvaternik, the most senior Usta≈°e still in Yugoslavia, proclaimed the Independent State of Croatia on 10 April 1941, and Artukoviƒá and the other √©migr√© Usta≈°e returned to Zagreb. On 12 April, Kvaternik formed an interim government, which included Artukoviƒá. Paveliƒá arrived in Zagreb on 15 April, and on the following day, Artukoviƒá became the Interior Minister in the first Croatian government. As a member of Paveliƒá's trusted inner circle, Artukoviƒá carried out the orders he was given. On 17 April, to provide authority for Usta≈°e policies targeting Serbs, Jews, Roma and anti-Usta≈°e Croats and Bosniaks within the NDH, Paveliƒá proclaimed the Law Decree on the Defence of the People and the State. It prohibited any person from acting against the Croatian people and its interests, for which the penalty was death. Such alleged offences were to be dealt with in a summary manner by a panel similar to a court martial. On 22 April, Artukoviƒá announced that the NDH government would solve the \\"Jewish question\\" in the same way as the German government, and a week later, he issued further racial laws, and advocated a policy of terror. These first and subsequent racial laws were vaguely worded, permitting wide interpretation. The organisation charged with enforcing these laws was the Directorate of Public Order and Security, which was subordinated to Artukoviƒá's Interior Ministry. The Directorate was established in May, and was headed by Eugen \\"Dido\\" Kvaternik, the son of Slavko Kvaternik. In the meantime, Artukoviƒá participated in the Croatian-Italian border negotiations that took place between Paveliƒá and the Italian Foreign Minister Count Galeazzo Ciano in Italian-annexed Ljubljana on 25 April 1941. The Italians made a claim for the entire eastern shore of the Adriatic, but Paveliƒá made a counter-offer of that part of Dalmatia that had been offered to Italy in the secret Treaty of London of 1915. The earlier Paveliƒá-Ciano agreement became the basis for the Treaties of Rome, which ceded these areas to Italy, and Artukoviƒá also accompanied Paveliƒá to the signing of those treaties in mid-May. On 6 June, Artukoviƒá accompanied Paveliƒá during his visit to Adolf Hitler. On 24 February 1942, at the opening of the Croatian Parliament (), Artukoviƒá announced the creation of the Croatian Orthodox Church, which was intended to replace the Serbian Orthodox Church for Serbs living within the NDH. During the same speech, he promised that the NDH would take more radical action against Jews than Nazi Germany, referring to the Jewish people of the NDH as \\"insatiable and poisonous parasites\\" who would be destroyed, and stating that Croats had been forced to serve the Jews in pursuit of their \\"filthy\\" profits and \\"materialistic and grasping\\" ambitions. This speech preceded a systematic campaign against Croatian Jews which included mass deportations to NDH concentration camps and German extermination camps. After the government reshuffle on 10 October 1942, Artukoviƒá became Minister of Justice and Religion, then from 29 April 1943 until 1 October 1943 he was again the Minister of Interior. He was Secretary of State from 11 October 1943 until the collapse of the Independent State of Croatia on 8 May 1945. Andrija Artukoviƒá delivering a speech in the Sabor in 1942 Emigration, repatriation, and trials With other members of Government, he left Zagreb on 6 May 1945 and went to Austria. He was detained in an Allied camp in Spittal an der Drau. On 18 May 1945, British extradited some Croatian ministers and Prime Minister Nikola Mandiƒá to the Yugoslav authorities. Artukoviƒá was not extradited, but he was released soon with remaining ministers. He left the British occupational zone, then went via the American to the French occupational zone, where his family was. In November 1946, he crossed the Austria‚ÄìSwitzerland border. In Switzerland, he declared a false name, Alois Anich, and a false visa. In February 1947, he asked Swiss authorities to get a Nansen passport. Some months later, they found out his real identity. Switzerland offered him to keep his Nansen passport provided that he and his family would leave Switzland until 15 July 1947. Exactly at that date, they took a plane to Ireland. About one year later, they entered the United States on a tourist visaJ√ºrgen Schoch: Der Deal mit dem kroatischen Faschisten ‚Äì wie die Bundesanwaltschaft 1947 dem ¬´Schl√§chter vom Balkan¬ª half (NZZ.ch 13 January 2020) and settled in Seal Beach, California. He worked at a company owned by his brother. As an accused war criminal, Porajmos perpetrator and Usta≈°e official, he did not qualify for legal status in the United States and remained in the country after overstaying his visa. In July 1945, the Yugoslav State Commission for Investigation of Crimes of Occupiers and Their Allies declared Artukoviƒá a war criminal. The Government of the FPR Yugoslavia made a request for his extradition on 29 August 1951. Their request met with a seven years long bureaucratic delay in Los Angeles, California due to the influence of the Croatian √©migr√© community and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles, to whom Artukoviƒá and his family had appealed. On 15 January 1959, U.S. Commissioner Theodore Hocke rejected Yugoslavia's extradition request; the INS's grounds for refusing extradition was \\"...since the crimes for which extradition was requested were deemed 'political' by the court, if Artukovic were deported to Yugoslavia, he would be \\"subject to physical persecution\\".Depoartment of US State document A-124 artukovic case May 24, 1961, foia.cia.gov; accessed 10 February 2016. When the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) raised the question of the legal basis of the stay in the US of a large number of associates of and/or collaborationists with Nazi Germany, the Yugoslav authorities, under the initiative of the Special Investigation Court of the U.S. Department of Justice, renewed their request for Artukoviƒá's extradition. He was arrested on 14 November 1984, and a court process began in New York. During the trial, the United States Justice Department (USDOJ) attorneys referred to Artukoviƒá as the \\"Butcher of the Balkans\\". He was ordered extradited to Yugoslavia on 11 November 1986, where he was tried in the Zagreb District Court. He was found guilty of: *ordering the deaths of a lawyer and former member of the Yugoslav National Assembly, Dr. Je≈°a Vidiƒá, in early 1941; *ordering the deaths by machine gun fire of 450 men, women and children in late 1941 because there was no room for them in a concentration camp; *ordering the killing of the entire population of the town of Vrginmost and its surrounding villages in 1942; and *ordering the execution of \\"several hundred\\" prisoners at Samobor Castle near Zagreb in 1943 by having them driven into an open field, where they were machine-gunned and then crushed by tanks. The court held that Artukoviƒá's intent had originated with \\"his Usta≈°a orientation, by which persecutions, concentration camps and mass killings of Serbs, Jews, Gypsies, as well as Croats who did not accept the ideology, were part of the implementation of a program of creating a 'pure' Croatia.\\" In sentencing him to death, the court described him as one of the \\"ruthless murderers, who under the cover of 'protecting purity of race and faith' and with the aim of realising their Nazi-Fascist ideology, [... ] killed, slaughtered, tortured, crippled, exposed to great suffering, and persecuted thousands and thousands of people, among whom were women and children.\\" He was sentenced to death, but the sentence was not carried out due to his age and poor health. Death Artukoviƒá died of natural causes in prison hospital in Zagreb on 16 January 1988. His son, Radoslav, requested information about his father's burial from the Yugoslav authorities. A special law was passed in Yugoslavia that the remains of those convicted and sentenced to death but who escaped execution, were to be disposed of as those of executed persons. It is unclear what happened to his remains. In 2010‚Äîat the request of one of Artukoviƒá's sons, Radoslav, a California native‚Äîthe president of the Croatian Helsinki Committee, Ivan Zvonimir ƒåiƒçak, called for authorities to investigate what happened to the remains.

In 2004, it had 127 houses and 325 inhabitants. The village was first mentioned in a 1241 deed. In 1636 Sadov√° was part of the Smi≈ôice lordship acquired by the Imperial General Lieutenant Matthias Gallas, who thereby reaped the awards for his conspiration against Generalissimo Albrecht von Wallenstein. In the 18th century it was a possession of the Schaffgotsch noble family, later of the House of Harrach residing at Hr√°dek u Nechanic. During the War of the Bavarian Succession, Habsburg troops occupied the heights above the city from July to October; Prussian troops occupied the territory between Sadov√° and Nachod. Neither army engaged in combat, although the imperial forces frequently shelled the Prussians, and both armies ravaged the countryside for foodstuffs. On July 3, 1866, the area around Sadov√° became the scene of the sanguinary Battle of K√∂niggr√§tz, also known as the Battle of Sadowa, the decisive combat of the Austro-Prussian War.

Biography He was born about 1585 near Verdun of a Calvinist family, and studied at the university of Paris. He then joined Turenne's army in the Netherlands, where he gained rapid advancement. He was the author of a tragedy, Tyr et Sidon, ou les funestes amours de Belcar et M√©liane, published in 1608 under the anagram-name Daniel d'Anch√©res, and reprinted with numerous changes in 1628 under the author's own name. It has been suggested that Schelandre was directly acquainted with Shakespearian drama, but of this there is no direct proof, although he appears to have spent some time in England and to have seen James I. He pursued his military career to the end of his life, dying at Saumaz√®nes in 1635 from wounds received in the German campaign of Louis d'Epernon, Cardinal de la Valette. Tyr et Sidon In defiance of all rules, the action of Tyr et Sidon proceeds alternately at Tyre where Belcar, prince of Sidon, is a prisoner, and at Sidon where L√©onte, prince of Tyre, is a prisoner and pursues his gallant adventures. The play, which was divided into two days and ten acts, had a complicated plot and contained 5000 lines. It required an immense stage on which the two towns should be represented, with a field between, where the contests should take place. Tyr et Sidon is noteworthy as an attempt to introduce the liberty of the Spanish and English drama into France, thus anticipating the romantic revolt of the 19th century. It is reprinted in the 8th volume of the Ancien Th√©√¢tre fran√ßais. Schelandre was also the author of a Stuartide (1611), and of Les Sept Excellents Travaux de la penitence de Saint Pierre (1636).

In the past, cowry were actually cultivated in the Maldives. When Moroccan traveler and historian Ibn Battuta visited therefadsahijsjsac0, feojedfe Dutch in Ceylon, continued until the late 19th century, when it was used mostly as ballast for sailing vessels. =Dhigu laari= According to history, the first dhigu laari was struck in the Maldives, during the reign of Sultan Ibrahim III ibn Ghazi Muhammed (1585-1607), son of the hero Sultan Ghazi Muhammed Thakurufa'anu Akbar al-'Azam. Dhigu laari or larin, which owes its name to Lar, in the Persian Gulf, where it was originally struck, was one of the standard currencies of the Indian Ocean in the late 16th century. The dhigu laari is actually a long piece of silver, about three inches in length, doubled over and stamped with the name of the sultan, in Arabic. =Loa laari= Loa laari or laari fothi (\\"circular coin\\") was first struck by Sultan Ibrahim Iskandar I (1648-1687). The first coins were of silver and fairly coarse. Later, coins of copper and lead were put into circulation. Gold coins were also struck by Sultan Hassan Nooraddin (1779-1799). Said to be the finest struck at the Maldive mint, the two denominations of gold coins issued by Sultan Hassan Nooraddin, known as the mohori and bai mohori, were never put into circulation.

On 1 February 2009, the exchange rate with the US dollar was USD1.00 = MVR12.80. On 10 April 2011, the Government announced a limited float of the currency within a band of 20% from the previous exchange rate of 12.80.

Fishing  = Pole and Line Fishing = Since time immemorial, the method of fishing employed in the Archipelago has been the pole and line method. The types of fish caught by this method are tuna, skipjack tuna, frigate and mackerel. The main catch is tuna, which is used in the daily diet of the inhabitants, as well as for export in different forms. The daily catch depends for the most part on the seasons. Although triangular sailed dhoni were used in the past, today fishing dhoanis are mechanized. Traditionally, the fishermen set out at dawn in search of bait fish, which were caught and kept alive in a specially prepared compartment of the dhoani. Eight or nine men did the actual fishing. The poles are short, are equipped with a line, and hook. During a favorable season, the catch could be as much as a thousand fish per dhoani per day. Traditionally, the fishermen return to the island by nightfall however, with the advent of mechanized dhoani, they are back by early afternoon. Skipjack tuna and yellowfin tuna are the most common species caught in Maldives. =Industrial Fishing= Mechanization of the traditional sailing dhoani in 1974 revolutionized the fisheries industry of the Maldives. A new generation of dhoani, designed especially for mechanization was introduced. A fish-canning factory was set up in 1977 as a joint venture with a Japanese company. However, when the government took over the plant in 1982, it was unable to meet the overseas demand due to the poor condition of buildings and equipment, so a new factory was opened in 1986. In 1979, Maldives Nippon Corporation was formed, in partnership with the Marubeni Corporation of Japan, to process and can fresh tuna. In the same year, the Maldives Fisheries Corporation was formed to exploit fish wealth. (The MFC later became the Fisheries Projects Implementation Department (FPID), which was transformed into MIFCO in 1993). When the Japanese pulled out, the government negotiated a deal to buy the three freezer and six collector vessels that belonged to them, which then became part of the State Trading Organization (STO) fleet. However, by the time that STO inherited the Japanese fleet; the vessels were over twenty years old. A new fleet of vessels was acquired. Three mother ships were built in Korea and nine collector vessels were constructed in Mal√©. A boat yard was built on the island of Alifushi and the construction of one hundred second- generation Mark II dhoanis was begun. These dhoanis were sold to the fishermen on a lease-purchase basis. The opening up of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ), for fisheries proved to be a boon to the country's fishing industry. =Fish Cannery= The first fish canning plant was established on the island of Felivaru, as a joint venture with a Japanese firm, in 1977. In 1982, the government took over the cannery, but the condition of the original buildings, equipment seriously limited production, and the cannery was not able to meet the increasing demand of an expanding overseas market. In 1987, a new cannery and cooling/freezing plant opened. The work was done buy the NORAD project(Norwegians and Englishmen). The Norwegians built the buildings, while the Englishmen worked the unsteady ground underneath. The plant was fully opened September/October 1987. The new Felivaru Tuna Processing Plant has its own electricity, a desalination plant, water storage tanks and an ice making plant. While this 150,000 cans per hour plant increased production, it was still unable to meet the rising overseas demand for Maldive tuna. Tourism =Development= White sandy beaches, clear waters, and waving palms under blue skies make Maldives a tourist destination. Tourism was introduced to the Maldives in the early 1970s. The first two resort islands had a capacity of 280 beds. The first tourists arrived mostly as individuals or small groups. Soon, Maldives began to be recognized as an international tourist destination. In 1972, the first tourist resort, Kurumba Village, (today a five star hotel), was pioneered by two Maldivian entrepreneurs in association with an Italian investor. A second resort was opened the same year on the island of Bandos. Despite the basic facilities and services, 1,096 tourist arrivals were recorded that year. At the start, the country's tourism and its development was for the most part dependent on private initiative. In 1979, the tourism law was enacted, requiring all foreign investments to be registered at the Department of Tourism and Foreign Investment. A tourism master plan was formulated in 1983, setting up guidelines for the overall development of tourism, and identifying tourism zones in different parts of the country. In 1984, the tourism advisory board was created. The department of tourism was upgraded to a ministry in 1988. The opening of Mal√© International Airport in 1981 was an important milestone in the travel business. At the early stages, tourism in Maldives was a seasonal industry. As the country opened up further, this seasonal nature of tourism changed. In the early 21st century tourist arrivals were recorded throughout the year. During 1987, a school of hotel and catering was established to meet the manpower requirements of the industry. Both government and private sector provide overseas training to those employed in the industry. The private sector and the government are actively involved in the promotion and marketing of the tourism product. Maldives is represented in all major international travel fairs by both the government and the private operators. The tourist information counter at the Mal√© International Airport hands out leaflets and other information about the country. The Tourist Information Unit was formed in 1989 to further disseminate information. The development of tourism has fostered the overall growth of the country's economy. It has created direct and indirect employment and income generation opportunities in other related industries. Today, tourism is the country's biggest foreign exchange earner, contributing nearly a fifth of the GDP. With 86 tourist resorts in operation, the year 2000 recorded 467,154 tourist arrivals. =Tourist Facilities= Each tourist resort is situated on an uninhabited island. The islands are self-contained, with its own electricity, water and waste disposal facilities. The islands are developed according to the standards and guidelines set by the Ministry of Tourism. While all modern facilities are available, the islands retain its unique natural beauty. The designs feature local architectural concepts as well as international style. A variety of services and facilities are available to guests, to make visits comfortable, pleasant and memorable. =Maldives Tourism Promotion Board= The Maldives Tourism Promotion Board was established by the government to promote quality and sustainable growth in the country's tourism industry and to foster a well utilized and financially healthy private sector industry. - in this way enabling the industry to deliver long term economic, social and cultural benefits to the people of Maldives, whilst at the same time contributing to enhancements in Maldives‚Äô marine environment to the benefit of the people and visitors of the Maldives. = MATI = Maldives Association of Tourism Industry (MATI) is a non-profit non-governmental organization working towards the sustainable development of the country's tourism industry. Its membership is open to those engaged in the travel trade business. MATI coordinates its activities with the government and work in partnership with other national and international organizations.

Mainflingen was the first mediumwave transmitter for the radio station Deutschlandfunk. It went into service in 1962 with a transmission power of 50 kW, on a frequency of 1538 kHz, at the upper end of the mediumwave band. This frequency has a bad groundwave propagation and therefore a low range at daytime, but an excellent skywave propagation with a long range at night. In December 1962 the transmission power of Mainflingen was increased to 300 kW. Until 1967 its antenna was on the same site as the Mainflingen longwave transmitters. This resulted in interference problems, which made the desired further increase of transmission power impossible. A new transmitter, with a directional and an omnidirecional antenna, was built in the mid-1960s on a site south of the A3, at a distance great enough from the longwave transmitters that even when using a power of 1000 kW, no greater interference problems would occur. This facility went into service on January 1, 1967. The directional and the omnidirectional antennas were somewhat unusual for mediumwave broadcasting antennas. The omnidirectional antenna consisted of a ground-fed 142-metre-tall guyed mast, carrying a double conical cage antenna with a diameter of 64 metres. This construction allowed its usage for all mediumwave frequencies, and therefore also as backup antenna for Deutschlandfunk's mediumwave transmitters at other sites. The directional antenna consisted of two horizontal dipoles which were mounted on 4.85-metre- tall guyed masts at a height of 75 metres, with a radiation maximum showing in northeast and southwest direction. As the omnidirectional antenna could not be used for the full available transmission power of 700 kW, in 1974 a 95-metre- tall guyed ground-fed mast radiator was built. A transmission power of 1050 kW was also possible by switching the third backup transmitter in parallel, but for economical reasons was never used. The transmitter was now run during the day with 700 kW and omnidirectional radiation, and at night with 350 kW and directional radiation, and was also used in the evenings for transmitting English-language programmes. The introduction of the wave plan of Geneva resulted in an increase of the transmission frequency from 1538 kHz to 1539 kHz. Mainflingen's daily operation mode was not affected. However, according to the wave plan, it was no longer allowed to use the double conical antenna as backup antenna for Deutschlandfunk's other mediumwave transmitters. The regulations of the wave plan of Geneva do not normally allow operation of backup transmitters more than 50 kilometres away from the standard site without special coordinative measures. This antenna was therefore dismantled in 1982. After March 1, 1983 Deutschlandfunk was also broadcast at night using omnidirectional radiation, and the four masts of the directional antenna was dismantled afterwards. From April 1, 1988 the transmission power was reduced to 350 kW. Beside the bad groundwave propagation of the used frequency, broadcasts from the transmitter were only sufficiently well-received during daytime, despite the high power output. This resulted in a shut-down of the transmitter on December 31, 1994, some years after the cancellation of foreign language transmissions. As a replacement, Saarl√§ndischer Rundfunk's Heusweiler transmitter was leased. It was first planned to demolish the Mainflingen facility, but on April 1, 1996 Evangeliums-Rundfunk (ERF), a religious broadcaster, which already hired transmission time at Trans World Radio restarted its operation. Several disputes between Deutsche Telekom and the Mainhausen municipality occurred, as after the relaunch, problems with electromagnetic influence of electric devices were reported. Local residents were therefore opposed to continued use of the transmitter. In 1998 it was decided that the site could be used for mediumwave transmission and modernization of the facility started. First the old transmitter was replaced by a new, fully transistorized transmitter, which would be also able to operate in DRM mode. In order to allow a good night-time transmission without causing too many problems with electromagnetic influence, a cross-dipole antenna with a radiation maximum pointing vertically into the sky was built in early 2006. This antenna, which is one of the few applications of circular polarisation for broadcasting, is mounted on 5 guyed masts. The central mast of this antenna is grounded. It carries the feeder cables running to the dipole, while the masts at the edge are standing on insulators and grounded via inductances in such way that they radiate as low a frequency as possible. In this way, undesired parasitic radiations, which are the cause of electromagnetic influence, are suppressed. The radiated wave must be right- hand polarized, otherwise the signal reflected on the ionosphere would be 20 dB less strong. In spring 2006 this new antenna went into service. It is used only for night-time transmissions, as the desired ionospheric reflection occurs only at night. During the day the old mast is used.

As a minister of president Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Prieto's government, he played a pivotal role in shaping the state and politics in the 19th century, delivering with the Constitution of 1833 the framework of the Chilean state for almost a century. Portales' influential political policies included unitarianism, presidentialism and conservatism which led to the consolidation of Chile as a constitutional, authoritarian republic with the franchise restricted to upper class men. While deeply unpopular during his lifetime, his murder in 1837, during a mutiny, has been judged a decisive factor during the War of the Confederation. Chilean public opinion shifted to support the war against the Peru‚ÄìBolivian Confederation. Many Chileans and historians view him as the power behind the throne of the early republic era, particularly in his shaping the Constitution of 1833. While he never assumed the presidency, his influence permitted him to serve simultaneously as the Minister of War, Minister of the Interior and Minister of Foreign Relations. He was an early proponent of Chilean expansionism. Early life Coat of arms of the Portales family Diego Portales was born in Santiago, the son of Mar√≠a Encarnaci√≥n Fern√°ndez de Palazuelos y Mart√≠nez de Aldunate and Jos√© Santiago Portales y Larra√≠n, a superintendent of the royal mint. He did his primary studies at the Colegio de Santiago, and in 1813, attended law classes at the National Institute. As the men of his family had all become successful merchants, Portales also eventually assumed the position of a merchant, taking part in his prosperous and distinguished family's occupation.Crow, John A. \\"Democracy of the Oligarchy.\\" The Epic of Latin America. By John A. Crow. 4th ed. New York: University of California P, 1992. 640. On August 15, 1819 he married his cousin, Josefa Portales y Larra√≠n. He had two daughters with her, both of whom died within days of their birth. His wife died also very soon in 1821. He never remarried after that, but took Constanza Nordenflicht as his mistress, with whom he had three children. In July 1821, he resigned his job at the Mint and went into business. He opened a trading house, Portales, Cea and Co., based in Valparaiso with a branch in Lima, Peru. He bid and obtained the management of the government monopoly on tobacco, tea, and liquor (known in Spanish as estanco). In exchange for the monopoly, he offered to service the full amount of the Chilean foreign debt. Nonetheless, in the anarchy that was regnant in Chile at the time, there was no means of enforcing a monopoly because the government could not regulate sales of tobacco, tea, and liquor, and the company eventually went bankrupt. So his contract with the government was voided and the Chilean government was found to owe Portales 87,000 pesos. Out of this unsuccessful business venture, the only remnant was the name eventually applied to his political followers, who in time came to be known as the estanqueros (monopolists.) Political career Soon after, he aligned with the conservatives in the political fights that were wracking Chile at the time. As aforementioned, in 1824, Portales‚Äô business firm acquired control over the government's monopoly of tobacco, tea, and liquor; however, the country's troubled conditions soon thwarted his profitable business. For these reasons, Portales finally entered into the political sphere, and very soon he would become the intellectual leader of the conservative side. He helped to reorganize the conservative party, and, in 1827, founded El Hambriento (or The Starveling), a journal attacking liberal idealists known as the pipiolos (‚Äúwhite beaks‚Äù) from Portales' party's (a.k.a. the pelucones or \\"old wigs\\") perspective. Portales was an effective satirist, contributing several popular articles to The Starveling. Portales' articles placed him in the limelight and paved the way for his political career.Crow, John A. \\"Democracy of the Oligarchy.\\" The Epic of Latin America. By John A. Crow. 4th ed. New York: University of California P, 1992. 641.\\"Diego Portales\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 2008. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. 15 October 2008. Early print (1854)After the triumph of the conservatives in the Revolution of 1829, President Jos√© Tom√°s Ovalle y Bezanilla named him Minister of the Interior and Foreign Affairs on April 6, 1830 remaining until May 1831. He was named again to that position by President Fernando Err√°zuriz Aldunate on July 9, 1831 and remained until August 31, 1831 and named once again by President Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Prieto from November 9, 1835 to January 1837. Something similar happened with his nomination as minister of war and navy from April 6, 1830 until May 1831; then from July 9, 1831 until December 1832 and from September 21, 1835 to September 1836. Though Portales was never president officially (and in fact avoided this position for fear of being tied up by factional promises), he became a dictator and with this powerful position, he quelled anarchy. Portales set up a civil militia (which ended one of the worst stages of militarism in Chile's history); supported an oligarchic control for landowners, miners, and merchants; and made Catholicism the state religion. As a result of his campaign for peace, order, and thus progress, business also improved.Crow (see Source #2) =Political philosophy= In 1822, before his rise to power Portales wrote to a friend: > Politics doesn't interest me, but as a good citizen I feel free to express > my opinions and to censure the government. Democracy, which is so loudly > proclaimed by the deluded is an absurdity in our countries, flooded as they > are with vices and with their citizens lacking all sense of civic virtue, > the prerequisite to establishing a real Republic. But monarchy is not the > American ideal either; if we get out of one terrible government just to jump > headlong into another, what will we have gained? The Republican system is > the one which we must adopt, but do you know how I interpret it for our > countries? A strong central government whose representatives will be men of > true virtue and patriotism, and who thus can direct the citizens along the > path of order and progress. These words are demonstrative of the skepticism in pure democracies that the recently failed French revolution impressed upon many. Portales believed that to avoid disaster it was most important to create a stable and functioning government, rather than one ruled by lofty but ultimately impractical ideals. He believed in a peaceful but strong central government, and that in order to successfully run a state or country, citizens must be virtuous and patriotic and must consider the law as higher than any leader. Beyond these beliefs, Portales had no static political beliefs. Instead he tried to govern on a case by case basis, legislating what he deemed right for each particular instance. =Assassination= 200px 200px The Chilean government, in order to bolster its standing, immediately imposed martial law and asked for (and obtained) extraordinary legislative powers from Congress. Early in 1837 a Court Martial Law was approved and given jurisdiction over all citizens for the duration of the war. The opposition to the Prieto Vial administration immediately accused Portales of tyranny, and started a heated press campaign against him personally and the unpopular war in general. Political and public opposition to war immediately affected the army, fresh from the purges of the civil war of 1830. On June 3, 1837, Colonel Jos√© Antonio Vidaurre, commander of the Maipo regiment, captured and imprisoned Portales while he was reviewing troops at the army barracks in Quillota. Vidaurre immediately proceeded to attack Valpara√≠so on the mistaken belief that public opinion opposed to the war would support him and topple the government. Rear Admiral Manuel Blanco Encalada, in charge of the defense, defeated him right outside the port at the Battle of Bar√≥n. Captain Santiago Flor√≠n, who was in charge of Portales, had him shot when he heard of the news, on June 6, 1837. Most of the conspirators were subsequently captured and executed. This murder turned the tide of Chilean public opinion. The government derogated Martial law and the country rallied behind the government. The war became a holy cause, and Portales a martyr. Legacy Statue of Minister Diego Portales in Vi√±a del Mar Statue of Portales at the Plaza de la Constituci√≥n in the Chilean presidential palace, Santiago Portales' reign helped to pick up business and accelerate the growth of the economy. Those who particularly benefited from his conservative rule were the already rich. Additionally, Portales helped Chile maintain a good deal of stability relative to many of the other Latin American nations. This was accomplished by Portales' improvement and renewal of the administration of the State, his strategic vision of Chile as an independent and sovereign Latin American country, and his influence in the Chilean Constitution of 1833, which is considered the most important milestone of Chilean institutionality during the 19th century. His ideals and principles served as a foundation to the Chilean government of the future. His work was especially influential during the years of political learning of the post-independence turmoil and during the governments of the Conservative Republic (1830‚Äì1861) and in a lesser degree the governments of the Liberal Republic (1861‚Äì1891). The figure and legacy of Portales has been praised by some historians like Ram√≥n Sotomayor Vald√©s and Alberto Edwards. Other historians, including Benjam√≠n Vicu√±a Mackenna, Sergio Villalobos and Gabriel Salazar, have a negative view of Diego Portales. Remains Portales' remains, missing since his assassination, were found in March 2005 in Santiago's Metropolitan Cathedral during renovation projects, and were identified after forensic examination.http://www.fotolog.com/chilesuhistoria/42948636 Further reading *Collier, Simon.

This device grows more efficient with the amount of mass being lifted, which was used as the hook for the stories‚Äîit was more effective to lift an entire city than it was to lift something smaller, such as a classic spaceship. This is taken to extremes in the final stories, where an entire planet is used to cross the galaxy in a matter of hours using the spindizzy drive. According to the stories, the spindizzy is based on principles contained in an equation coined by P.M.S. Blackett, a British physicist of the mid-20th century. Several other Blish stories involving novel space drives contain the same assertion. Blackett's original formula was an attempt to correlate the known magnetic fields of large rotating bodies, such as the Sun, Earth, and a star in Cygnus whose field had been measured indirectly. It was unusual in that it brought Isaac Newton's gravitational constant and Coulomb's constant together, the one governing forces between masses, the other governing forces between electric charges. However, it was later disproved by more accurate measurements, and by new discoveries such as magnetic field reversals on Earth and the Sun, and the lack of a magnetic field on bodies such as Mars, despite its rotation being similar to Earth's. Blish's extrapolation was that if rotation combined with mass produces magnetism via gravity, then rotation and magnetism could produce anti-gravity. The field created by a spindizzy is described as altering the magnetic moment of any atom within its influence.

In warmer seasons and climates, weasels have predominantly brown coats. Coat is the nature and quality of a mammal's pelage. In the animal fancy, coat is an attribute that reflects the quality of a specimen's breeding as well as the level of the animal's care, conditioning, and management. Coat is an integral aspect of the judging at competitions such as a conformation dog show, a cat show, a horse show (especially showmanship classes), or a rabbit show. The pelage of a show animal may be divided into different types of hair, fur or wool with a texture ranging from downy to spiky. In addition, the animal may be single-coated or may have a number of coats, such as an undercoat and a topcoat (also called an outer coat or, sometimes, overcoat), which is made up of guard hair. The state of the coat is considered an indication of the animal's breeding and health. Animals might have different coat quality for different seasons. Normally, animals with fur or hair body coats may develop a thicker and/or longer winter coat in colder times of the year, which will shed out to a shorter, sleeker, summer coat as the days lengthen into spring and summer. This process may not occur in a noticeable fashion in climates that are warm year-round, though animals may nonetheless shed their coats periodically. The process may also be minimized by artificially keeping the animal blanketed, or, in the case of small animals, housed indoors. Pinnipeds and polar bears have longer guard hairs forming the most visible fur;Annalisa Berta, James L. Sumich, Kit M. Kovacs, Pieter Arend Folkens, Peter J.

A computer on which a hypervisor runs one or more virtual machines is called a host machine, and each virtual machine is called a guest machine. The hypervisor presents the guest operating systems with a virtual operating platform and manages the execution of the guest operating systems. Multiple instances of a variety of operating systems may share the virtualized hardware resources: for example, Linux, Windows, and macOS instances can all run on a single physical x86 machine. This contrasts with operating-system-level virtualization, where all instances (usually called containers) must share a single kernel, though the guest operating systems can differ in user space, such as different Linux distributions with the same kernel. The term hypervisor is a variant of supervisor, a traditional term for the kernel of an operating system: the hypervisor is the supervisor of the supervisors, with hyper- used as a stronger variant of super-. The term dates to circa 1970; in the earlier CP/CMS (1967) system, the term Control Program was used instead.  Type-1 and type-2 hypervisors In their 1974 article, Formal Requirements for Virtualizable Third Generation Architectures, Gerald J. Popek and Robert P. Goldberg classified two types of hypervisor: ; Type-1, native or bare-metal hypervisors : These hypervisors run directly on the host's hardware to control the hardware and to manage guest operating systems. For this reason, they are sometimes called bare metal hypervisors. The first hypervisors, which IBM developed in the 1960s, were native hypervisors. These included the test software SIMMON and the CP/CMS operating system (the predecessor of IBM's z/VM). Modern equivalents include AntsleOS, Microsoft Hyper-V and Xbox One system software, Nutanix AHV, XCP-ng, Oracle VM Server for SPARC, Oracle VM Server for x86, POWER Hypervisorhttps://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/POWER6/iphb2/iphb2hypervisor.htm and VMware ESXi (formerly ESX) and Xen. ; Type-2 or hosted hypervisors : These hypervisors run on a conventional operating system (OS) just as other computer programs do. A guest operating system runs as a process on the host. Type-2 hypervisors abstract guest operating systems from the host operating system. Parallels Desktop for Mac, QEMU, VirtualBox, VMware Player and VMware Workstation are examples of type-2 hypervisors. The distinction between these two types is not always clear. For instance, Linux's Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) and FreeBSD's bhyve are kernel modules that effectively convert the host operating system to a type-1 hypervisor. At the same time, since Linux distributions and FreeBSD are still general-purpose operating systems, with applications competing with each other for VM resources, KVM and bhyve can also be categorized as type-2 hypervisors. Mainframe origins The first hypervisors providing full virtualization were the test tool SIMMON and IBM's one-off research CP-40 system, which began production use in January 1967, and became the first version of IBM's CP/CMS operating system. CP-40 ran on a S/360-40 that was modified at the IBM Cambridge Scientific Center to support dynamic address translation, a feature that enabled virtualization. Prior to this time, computer hardware had only been virtualized to the extent to allow multiple user applications to run concurrently, such as in CTSS and IBM M44/44X. With CP-40, the hardware's supervisor state was virtualized as well, allowing multiple operating systems to run concurrently in separate virtual machine contexts. Programmers soon implemented CP-40 (as CP-67) for the IBM System/360-67, the first production computer system capable of full virtualization. IBM first shipped this machine in 1966; it included page- translation-table hardware for virtual memory, and other techniques that allowed a full virtualization of all kernel tasks, including I/O and interrupt handling. (Note that its \\"official\\" operating system, the ill-fated TSS/360, did not employ full virtualization.) Both CP-40 and CP-67 began production use in 1967. CP/CMS was available to IBM customers from 1968 to early 1970s, in source code form without support. CP/CMS formed part of IBM's attempt to build robust time-sharing systems for its mainframe computers. By running multiple operating systems concurrently, the hypervisor increased system robustness and stability: Even if one operating system crashed, the others would continue working without interruption. Indeed, this even allowed beta or experimental versions of operating systemsor even of new hardwareSee History of CP/CMS for virtual-hardware simulation in the development of the System/370to be deployed and debugged, without jeopardizing the stable main production system, and without requiring costly additional development systems. IBM announced its System/370 series in 1970 without the virtual memory feature needed for virtualization, but added it in the August 1972 Advanced Function announcement. Virtualization has been featured in all successor systems (all modern-day IBM mainframes, such as the zSeries line, retain backward compatibility with the 1960s-era IBM S/360 line). The 1972 announcement also included VM/370, a reimplementation of CP/CMS for the S/370. Unlike CP/CMS, IBM provided support for this version (though it was still distributed in source code form for several releases). VM stands for Virtual Machine, emphasizing that all, and not just some, of the hardware interfaces are virtualized. Both VM and CP/CMS enjoyed early acceptance and rapid development by universities, corporate users, and time-sharing vendors, as well as within IBM. Users played an active role in ongoing development, anticipating trends seen in modern open source projects. However, in a series of disputed and bitter battles, time-sharing lost out to batch processing through IBM political infighting, and VM remained IBM's \\"other\\" mainframe operating system for decades, losing to MVS. It enjoyed a resurgence of popularity and support from 2000 as the z/VM product, for example as the platform for Linux on IBM Z. As mentioned above, the VM control program includes a hypervisor-call handler that intercepts DIAG (\\"Diagnose\\", opcode x'83') instructions used within a virtual machine. This provides fast-path non-virtualized execution of file- system access and other operations (DIAG is a model-dependent privileged instruction, not used in normal programming, and thus is not virtualized. It is therefore available for use as a signal to the \\"host\\" operating system). When first implemented in CP/CMS release 3.1, this use of DIAG provided an operating system interface that was analogous to the System/360 Supervisor Call instruction (SVC), but that did not require altering or extending the system's virtualization of SVC. In 1985 IBM introduced the PR/SM hypervisor to manage logical partitions (LPAR). Operating system support Several factors led to a resurgence around 2005 in the use of virtualization technology among Unix, Linux, and other Unix-like operating systems: * Expanding hardware capabilities, allowing each single machine to do more simultaneous work * Efforts to control costs and to simplify management through consolidation of servers * The need to control large multiprocessor and cluster installations, for example in server farms and render farms * The improved security, reliability, and device independence possible from hypervisor architectures * The ability to run complex, OS-dependent applications in different hardware or OS environments Major Unix vendors, including HP, IBM, SGI and Sun Microsystems, have been selling virtualized hardware since before 2000. These have generally been large, expensive systems (in the multimillion-dollar range at the high end), although virtualization has also been available on some low- and mid-range systems, such as IBM's pSeries servers, HP Superdome series machines and Sun/Oracle's T-series CoolThreads servers. Although Solaris has always been the only guest domain OS officially supported by Sun/Oracle on their Logical Domains hypervisor, , Linux (Ubuntu and Gentoo), and FreeBSD have been ported to run on top of the hypervisor (and can all run simultaneously on the same processor, as fully virtualized independent guest OSes). Wind River \\"Carrier Grade Linux\\" also runs on Sun's Hypervisor. Full virtualization on SPARC processors proved straightforward: since its inception in the mid-1980s Sun deliberately kept the SPARC architecture clean of artifacts that would have impeded virtualization. (Compare with virtualization on x86 processors below.) HPE provides HP Integrity Virtual Machines (Integrity VM) to host multiple operating systems on their Itanium powered Integrity systems. Itanium can run HP-UX, Linux, Windows and OpenVMS, and these environments are also supported as virtual servers on HP's Integrity VM platform. The HP-UX operating system hosts the Integrity VM hypervisor layer that allows for many important features of HP-UX to be taken advantage of and provides major differentiation between this platform and other commodity platforms - such as processor hotswap, memory hotswap, and dynamic kernel updates without system reboot. While it heavily leverages HP-UX, the Integrity VM hypervisor is really a hybrid that runs on bare-metal while guests are executing. Running normal HP-UX applications on an Integrity VM host is heavily discouraged, because Integrity VM implements its own memory management, scheduling and I/O policies that are tuned for virtual machines and are not as effective for normal applications. HPE also provides more rigid partitioning of their Integrity and HP9000 systems by way of VPAR and nPar technology, the former offering shared resource partitioning and the latter offering complete I/O and processing isolation. The flexibility of virtual server environment (VSE) has given way to its use more frequently in newer deployments. IBM provides virtualization partition technology known as logical partitioning (LPAR) on System/390, zSeries, pSeries and iSeries systems. For IBM's Power Systems, the POWER Hypervisor (PHYP) is a native (bare-metal) hypervisor in firmware and provides isolation between LPARs. Processor capacity is provided to LPARs in either a dedicated fashion or on an entitlement basis where unused capacity is harvested and can be re-allocated to busy workloads. Groups of LPARs can have their processor capacity managed as if they were in a \\"pool\\" - IBM refers to this capability as Multiple Shared-Processor Pools (MSPPs) and implements it in servers with the POWER6 processor. LPAR and MSPP capacity allocations can be dynamically changed. Memory is allocated to each LPAR (at LPAR initiation or dynamically) and is address-controlled by the POWER Hypervisor. For real-mode addressing by operating systems (AIX, Linux, IBM i), the POWER processors (POWER4 onwards) have designed virtualization capabilities where a hardware address-offset is evaluated with the OS address-offset to arrive at the physical memory address. Input/Output (I/O) adapters can be exclusively \\"owned\\" by LPARs or shared by LPARs through an appliance partition known as the Virtual I/O Server (VIOS). The Power Hypervisor provides for high levels of reliability, availability and serviceability (RAS) by facilitating hot add/replace of many parts (model dependent: processors, memory, I/O adapters, blowers, power units, disks, system controllers, etc.) Similar trends have occurred with x86/x86-64 server platforms, where open-source projects such as Xen have led virtualization efforts. These include hypervisors built on Linux and Solaris kernels as well as custom kernels. Since these technologies span from large systems down to desktops, they are described in the next section. x86 systems Starting in 2005, CPU vendors have added hardware virtualization assistance to their products, for example: Intel VT-x (code-named Vanderpool) and AMD-V (code- named Pacifica). An alternative approach requires modifying the guest operating-system to make system calls to the hypervisor, rather than executing machine I/O instructions that the hypervisor simulates. This is called paravirtualization in Xen, a \\"hypercall\\" in Parallels Workstation, and a \\"DIAGNOSE code\\" in IBM's VM. All are really the same thing, a system call to the underlying hypervisor. Some microkernels such as Mach and L4 are flexible enough such that \\"paravirtualization\\" of guest operating systems is possible. Embedded systems Embedded hypervisors, targeting embedded systems and certain real-time operating system (RTOS) environments, are designed with different requirements when compared to desktop and enterprise systems, including robustness, security and real-time capabilities. The resource- constrained nature of many embedded systems, especially battery-powered mobile systems, imposes a further requirement for small memory-size and low overhead. Finally, in contrast to the ubiquity of the x86 architecture in the PC world, the embedded world uses a wider variety of architectures and less standardized environments. Support for virtualization requires memory protection (in the form of a memory management unit or at least a memory protection unit) and a distinction between user mode and privileged mode, which rules out most microcontrollers. This still leaves x86, MIPS, ARM and PowerPC as widely deployed architectures on medium- to high-end embedded systems. As manufacturers of embedded systems usually have the source code to their operating systems, they have less need for full virtualization in this space. Instead, the performance advantages of paravirtualization make this usually the virtualization technology of choice. Nevertheless, ARM and MIPS have recently added full virtualization support as an IP option and has included it in their latest high-end processors and architecture versions, such as ARM Cortex-A15 MPCore and ARMv8 EL2. Other differences between virtualization in server/desktop and embedded environments include requirements for efficient sharing of resources across virtual machines, high-bandwidth, low-latency inter-VM communication, a global view of scheduling and power management, and fine-grained control of information flows. Security implications The use of hypervisor technology by malware and rootkits installing themselves as a hypervisor below the operating system, known as hyperjacking, can make them more difficult to detect because the malware could intercept any operations of the operating system (such as someone entering a password) without the anti- malware software necessarily detecting it (since the malware runs below the entire operating system). Implementation of the concept has allegedly occurred in the SubVirt laboratory rootkit (developed jointly by Microsoft and University of Michigan researchers) as well as in the Blue Pill malware package. However, such assertions have been disputed by others who claim that it would be possible to detect the presence of a hypervisor-based rootkit. In 2009, researchers from Microsoft and North Carolina State University demonstrated a hypervisor-layer anti-rootkit called Hooksafe that can provide generic protection against kernel-mode rootkits.

An initially interbreeding population that splits into two or more distinct species sharing a common range exemplifies sympatric speciation. Such speciation may be a product of reproductive isolation ‚Äì which prevents hybrid offspring from being viable or able to reproduce, thereby reducing gene flow ‚Äì that results in genetic divergence. Sympatric speciation does not imply secondary contact, which is speciation or divergence in allopatry followed by range expansions leading to an area of sympatry. Sympatric species or taxa in secondary contact may or may not interbreed. Types of populations Four main types of population pairs exist in nature. Sympatric populations (or species) contrast with parapatric populations, which contact one another in adjacent but not shared ranges and do not interbreed; peripatric species, which are separated only by areas in which neither organism occurs; and allopatric species, which occur in entirely distinct ranges that are neither adjacent nor overlapping. Allopatric populations isolated from one another by geographical factors (e.g., mountain ranges or bodies of water) may experience genetic‚Äîand, ultimately, phenotypic‚Äîchanges in response to their varying environments. These may drive allopatric speciation, which is arguably the dominant mode of speciation. Evolving definitions and controversy The lack of geographic isolation as a definitive barrier between sympatric species has yielded controversy among ecologists, biologists, and zoologists regarding the validity of the term. As such, researchers have long debated the conditions under which sympatry truly applies, especially with respect to parasitism. Because parasitic organisms often inhabit multiple hosts during a life cycle, evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr stated that internal parasites existing within different hosts demonstrate allopatry, not sympatry. Today, however, many biologists consider parasites and their hosts to be sympatric (see examples below). Conversely, zoologist Michael J. D. White considered two populations sympatric if genetic interbreeding was viable within the habitat overlap. This may be further specified as sympatry occurring within one deme; that is, reproductive individuals must be able to locate one another in the same population in order to be sympatric. Others question the ability of sympatry to result in complete speciation: until recently, many researchers considered it nonexistent, doubting that selection alone could create disparate, but not geographically separated, species. In 2003, biologist Karen McCoy suggested that sympatry can act as a mode of speciation only when \\"the probability of mating between two individuals depend[s] [solely] on their genotypes, [and the genes are] dispersed throughout the range of the population during the period of reproduction\\". In essence, sympatric speciation does require very strong forces of natural selection to be acting on heritable traits, as there is no geographic isolation to aid in the splitting process. Yet, recent research has begun to indicate that sympatric speciation is not as uncommon as was once assumed. Syntopy Syntopy is a special case of sympatry. It means the joint occurrence of two species in the same habitat at the same time. Just as the broader term sympatry, \\"syntopy\\" is used especially for close species that might hybridise or even be sister species. Sympatric species occur together in the same region, but do not necessarily share the same localities as syntopic species do. Areas of syntopy are of interest because they allow to study how similar species may coexist without outcompeting each other. As an example, the two bat species Myotis auriculus and M. evotis were found to be syntopic in North America. In contrast, the marbled newt and the northern crested newt have a large sympatric range in western France, but differ in their habitat preferences and only rarely occur syntopically in the same breeding ponds. Sympatric speciation Different modes of speciation The lack of geographic constraint in isolating sympatric populations implies that the emerging species avoid interbreeding via other mechanisms. Before speciation is complete, two diverging populations may still produce viable offspring. As speciation progresses, isolating mechanisms ‚Äì such as gametic incompatibility that renders fertilization of the egg impossible ‚Äì are selected for in order to increase the reproductive divide between the two populations. =Species discrimination= Sympatric groups frequently show a greater ability to discriminate between their own species and other closely related species than do allopatric groups. This is shown in the study of hybrid zones. It is also apparent in the differences in levels of prezygotic isolation (by factors that prevent formation of a viable zygote) in both sympatric and allopatric populations. There are two main theories regarding this process: 1) differential fusion, which suggests that only populations with a keen ability to discriminate between species will persist in sympatry; and 2) character displacement, which implies that distinguishing characteristics will be heightened in areas where the species co-occur in order to facilitate discrimination. Reinforcement Reinforcement is the process by which natural selection reinforces reproductive isolation. In sympatry, reinforcement increases species discrimination and sexual adaptation in order to avoid maladaptive hybridization and encourage speciation. If hybrid offspring are either sterile or less-fit than non-hybrid offspring, mating between members of two different species will be selected against. Natural selection decreases the probability of such hybridization by selecting for the ability to identify mates of one's own species from those of another species. Reproductive character displacement Reproductive character displacement strengthens the reproductive barriers between sympatric species by encouraging the divergence of traits that are crucial to reproduction. Divergence is frequently distinguished by assortative mating between individuals of the two species. For example, divergence in the mating signals of two species will limit hybridization by reducing one's ability to identify an individual of the second species as a potential mate. Support for the reproductive character displacement hypothesis comes from observations of sympatric species in overlapping habitats in nature. Increased prezygotic isolation, which is associated with reproductive character displacement, has been observed in cicadas of genus Magicicada, stickleback fish, and the flowering plants of the genus Phlox. Differential fusion An alternative explanation for species discrimination in sympatry is differential fusion. This hypothesis states that of the many species have historically come into contact with one another, the only ones that persist in sympatry (and thus are seen today) are species with strong mating discrimination. On the other hand, species lacking strong mating discrimination are assumed to have fused while in contact, forming one distinct species. Differential fusion is less widely recognized than character displacement, and several of its implications are refuted by experimental evidence. For example, differential fusion implies greater postzygotic isolation among sympatric species, as this functions to prevent fusion between the species. However, Coyne and Orr found equal levels of postzygotic isolation among sympatric and allopatric species pairs in closely related Drosophila. Nevertheless, differential fusion remains a possible, though not complete, contributor to species discrimination. Examples Sympatry has been increasingly evidenced in current research. Because of this, sympatric speciation ‚Äì which was once highly debated among researchers ‚Äì is progressively gaining credibility as a viable form of speciation. =Orca: partial sympatry= Several distinct types of killer whale (Orcinus orca), which are characterized by an array of morphological and behavioral differences, live in sympatry throughout the North Atlantic, North Pacific and Antarctic oceans. In the North Pacific, three whale populations ‚Äì called \\"transient\\", \\"resident\\", and \\"offshore\\" ‚Äì demonstrate partial sympatry, crossing paths with relative frequency. The results of recent genetic analyses using mtDNA indicate that this is due to secondary contact, in which the three types encountered one another following the bidirectional migration of \\"offshore\\" and \\"resident\\" whales between the North Atlantic and North Pacific. Partial sympatry in these whales is, therefore, not the result of speciation. Furthermore, killer whale populations that consist of all three types have been documented in the Atlantic, evidencing that interbreeding occurs among them. Thus, secondary contact does not always result in total reproductive isolation, as has often been predicted. =Great spotted cuckoo and magpie: brood parasitism= Great spotted cuckoo, sympatric with the magpie The parasitic great spotted cuckoo (Clamator glandarius) and its magpie host, both native to Southern Europe, are completely sympatric species. However, the duration of their sympatry varies with location. For example, great spotted cuckoos and their magpie hosts in Hoya de Gaudix, southern Spain, have lived in sympatry since the early 1960s, while species in other locations have more recently become sympatric. Great spotted cuckoos, when in South Africa, are sympatric with at least 8 species of starling and 2 crows, pied crow and Cape crow. The great spotted cuckoo exhibits brood parasitism by laying a mimicked version of the magpie egg in the magpie's nest. Since cuckoo eggs hatch before magpie eggs, magpie hatchlings must compete with cuckoo hatchlings for resources provided by the magpie mother. This relationship between the cuckoo and the magpie in various locations can be characterized as either recently sympatric or anciently sympatric. The results of an experiment by Soler and Moller (1990) showed that in areas of ancient sympatry (species in cohabitation for many generations), magpies were more likely to reject most of the cuckoo eggs, as these magpies had developed counter-adaptations that aid in identification of egg type. In areas of recent sympatry, magpies rejected comparatively fewer cuckoo eggs. Thus, sympatry can cause coevolution, by which both species undergo genetic changes due to the selective pressures that one species exerts on the other. =Acromyrmex ant: isolation of fungal gardens= Leafcutter ants protect and nourish various species of fungus as a source of food in a system known as ant-fungus mutualism. Leafcutter ants belonging to the genus Acromyrmex are known for their mutualistic relationship with Basidiomycete fungi. Ant colonies are closely associated with their fungus colonies, and may have co-evolved with a consistent vertical lineage of fungi in individual colonies. Ant populations defend against the horizontal transmission of foreign fungi to their fungal colony, as this transmission may lead to competitive stress on the local fungal garden. Invaders are identified and removed by the ant colony, inhibiting competition and fungal interbreeding. This active isolation of individual populations helps maintain the genetic purity of the fungal colony, and this mechanism may lead to sympatric speciation within a shared habitat.

It was the most powerful European AM transmitter of the American Forces Network and transmitted on 873 kHz with a power of 150 kilowatts. It started operation in May 1951 on 872 kHz and moved its frequency to 873 kHz in 1978 according to the regulations of Waveplan of Geneva. The transmitter ceased broadcasting on 31 May 2013, and was decommissioned in September 2014. Its aerial consisted of three guyed lattice steel masts built in 1954-55. These masts, each eighty-six metres tall and insulated against ground, were arranged in a row with a distance of 140 metres between each mast. On 23 April 2015 the aerial was dismantled. As the numbers of American forces stationed in Europe has waxed and waned over the years, in response to developments in politics such as the end of the Cold War, this transmitter remained operational, though its observed signal strength appeared far less able to compete with other Medium- Wave broadcasters compared to reception reports made in the early to mid-1970s. For many European listeners in the 1970s and '80s, its relays of United States domestic networks provided the only American radio receivable in Germany, apart from stations specifically intended for overseas reception, such as the Voice of America.

In thought he became a pronounced Hegelian. Eventually he settled in Paris, where he at once attracted attention by brilliant literary criticisms, at first chiefly on great foreign writers, contributed to the Revue des deux mondes. He was elected municipal councillor at Versailles in 1870, deputy to the National Assembly for the department Seine-et-Oise in 1871 and senator for life in 1875. He supported the Republican party.

Basic skills * Straight Jump - A vertical jump with the body held straight and arms in a straight line above the body at take-off. * Tuck Jump - From a straight jump start, the knees are pulled up to the chest and the hands must at least briefly grasp the legs between the knees and ankle. * Pike Jump - Again from a straight jump start, the legs are straight, held together and lifted parallel to the trampoline and the arms and body reach forwards towards the pointed toes. * Straddle Jump - Similar to the pike jump except that the legs are spread sideways approximately 90¬∞ apart and the arms reach forward towards the pointed toes. * Seat Drop or Seat Landing - Landing in a seated position with the legs straight. The hands support the body one either side and very slightly behind the posterior, palms down with fingers pointed towards the pointed toes. * Seat Landing Half Twist to Seat Landing or Swivel Hips - Performing a seat landing, bounce up to a straight position (without landing) and then perform a half twist and land in the second seat landing facing in the opposite direction. * Half Twist and Full Twist - While in a straight jump position rotating the body until facing the opposite direction for a half twist or a complete 360¬∞ rotation for a full twist. * Stomach Drop, Front Drop or Front Landing - Landing horizontally on the bed, face down, with the arms bent to form a diamond shape with the hands overlapping slightly in front of the face. The legs should be bent slightly at the knee keeping the feet off the trampoline bed. But otherwise held in tension for a good landing. * Back Drop or Back Landing - Landing on the bed on the back. The legs are bent up at about 90¬∞ on landing with legs held straight and the head is held in line with the body flat on the bed (to avoid whiplash injury). * Hands and Knees 3/4 turnover - Bouncing on hands and knees then making a forward rotation to land in either Back Drop, to your feet or Seat Drop. * Turntable - from front drop, bouncing, staying horizontal, performing a half twist around, then landing in front drop. * Back drop half twist to back drop or Cradle - From back drop, bouncing up and rotating forwards, then performing a half twist, landing in back drop. Intermediate skills * Front Somersault - One complete forward rotation; the body can be in any of the tucked, piked or straight (rarely seen other than to develop straight barani) positions. * Back Somersault - One complete backward rotation; the body can be in any of the tucked, piked or straight positions. * Side Somersault - One complete left or right rotation; this is usually performed tucked, but advanced variations include piked: straight legs (bent body). The straight position is impossible as the asymmetry will develop severe twisting and transform the side somersault into a back somersault. Advanced skills * Barani - A front somersault with a half twist before landing; also known as a front-half. * 3/4 front (Crash Dive) - Three quarter straight front somersault that lands in the back drop position. * 1 and 3/4 front (1 and 3, 217) - One and three quarter front somersault (performed in tucked or pike shape) that lands in the back drop position. * 2 and 3/4 front (2 and 3, 317) - Two and three quarter front somersault that lands in the back drop position. * 1 and 1/4 front - One and one quarter front somersault (performed in tucked or pike shape) that lands in the front drop position. * 2 and 1/4 front - Two and one quarter front somersault that lands in the front drop position. * 3/4 back (Lazy Back, Easy Back) - Three quarter straight back somersault that lands in front drop position. * 1 and 3/4 back (Suicide) - One and three quarter back somersault that lands in front drop position. * 1 and 1/4 back - One and one quarter back somersault (performed in tucked or pike shape) that lands in the back drop position. * 2 and 1/4 back - Two and one quarter back somersault that lands in the back drop position. * Pullover or backover - Three quarter back somersault from back drop position that lands on feet. * Rebound - One full front somersault rotation from back drop position that lands on back drop position * Ballout - One and one quarter front somersault from back drop position that lands on feet. Usually performed after Crash Dive. * Cody - One and one quarter back somersault from front drop position that lands on feet. Usually performed after Lazy Back. * Kaboom - Three quarter back somersault from back drop position that lands on feet following the heels being bounced off the canvas. * Zack - Three quarter front somersault from front drop position that lands on feet following a 'kaboom'. * Arabian - Early half twist into front somersault with initial take-off being consistent with backward rotation. * Front Full - A full-twisting straight front somersault * Rudolph (or Rudy) - A single straight front somersault with one and a half twists. * Back Full (or Full) - A full-twisting straight back somersault. * Full in or Full out - A double back somersault with a full twist in the first or second somersault respectively. * Full in triff - A triple back somersault with a full twist in the first somersault. * Full in quadriff - A quadruple back somersault with a full twist in the first somersault. * Full out in - A triple back somersault with a full twist in the second somersault. * Dub back full out - A triple back somersault with a full twist in the third somersault. * Front Full in - A double front somersault with a full twist in the first somersault. * Full in full out - A double back somersault with a full twist in each somersault. * Full in half out - A double front somersault with a full twist in the first and a half twist in the second. * Full in Rudy out - A double Front somersault with a full twist in the first and a Rudy in the second. * Miller - A double back somersault with three full twists in any somersault. * Miller Plus/ Killer - A double back somersault with four full twists in any somersault. * Miller Plus Plus/ Killer Plus/ Thriller - A double back somersault with five full twists in any somersault. * Double Front - A double front somersault (may be performed in tuck or pike position). * Double Back - A double back somersault (may be performed in tuck, pike, or straight position). * Triple Front - A triple Front somersault. * Triple Back - A triple back somersault. * Quad Front - A quadruple front somersault. * Quad Back - A quadruple back somersault. * Half In (Tsukahara) - A barani followed by a back somersault. * Rudy In - A Rudy followed by a back somersault. * Rudy Out - A double front somersault with one and a half twists in the second somersault. * Fliffus - Double front somersault with at least one half twist. * Triffus - Triple front somersault with at least one half twist. * Quadriffus - Quadruple front somersault with at least one half twist. * Randolph (or Randy) - A single front somersault with two and a half twists. * Double Full - A single back somersault with two twists. * Triple Full - A single back somersault with three twists. * Quad Full - A single back somersault with four twists. * Quint Full - A single back somersault with five twists. * Sextuple Full - A single back somersault with six twists. * Septuple Full - A single back somersault with seven twists. * Octuple Full - A single back somersault with eight twists. * Barani ballout (BBO) - the same as a Ball out, but with one half twist. May also be performed with varying degrees of twist: e.g. rudolph/randolph/adolph ballout. * Adolph - A single front somersault with three and a half twists. * Full Half - A double front somersault with one twist in the first and a half twist in the second. * Full Rudy - A double front somersault with one twist in the first and one and a half twists in the second. * Frydolph - A single front somersault with four and a half twists. * Frydolph Plus/ Robodolph - A single front somersault with five and a half twists. * A note about twisting somersaults - although it is not impossible to associate different amount of twist with either front or back somersaults it is universal practice that front twisting somersaults will always have an odd half twist while back twisting somersaults will always have a round number of twists. This is to make it easier for the performer to 'spot' the bed prior to landing. * Somersaults may be performed in one of four positions: tuck, pike, straight (or layout), and puck. The tuck position is considered the least difficult. Somersaults done in pike or straight position are more difficult, and each complete rotation is awarded a 0.1 bonus to Degree of Difficulty. Puck position is a body position intermediate between tuck and pike, and is used in multiple twisting somersaults. Competition Terms * Degree of Difficulty (DD) or Tariff - A score added to the execution score which reflects the difficulty of the skills included in the routine. * Voluntary or Optional Routine (Vol) - A routine comprising skills chosen by the athlete or coach to reflect their best performance. Usually the routine must have a minimum (and sometimes at lower skill levels, a maximum) degree of difficulty. * Compulsory Routine (Set) - A routine which has a set list of skills and a set order which must be followed by all athletes in a competition. No degree of difficulty marks are given for this routine; the marks are purely for execution. * Time of flight (ToF) - A score added to the execution score which reflects the time the gymnast spends in the air when performing the routine. * Horizontal Displacement (HD score) - A score added to the total score. The score is calculated by how much the athlete is out of the \\"box\\" during the routine.

His father was Johann Georg Christoff Schetky, a celebrated composer and cellist, who had settled in Edinburgh in 1773, and had married Maria Anna Theresa Reinagle, also of Hungarian descent, in 1774. John Christian was the couple's fourth son. He was educated at the Royal High School, Edinburgh, where he formed a lifelong friendship with his near-contemporary, Walter Scott. furious action between H.M.S.

After travelling on the continent, he settled in Oxford, where he taught for six years as a drawing-master. In 1808 he obtained a post in the Royal Military College at Great Marlow; and three years later he was appointed professor of drawing in the Royal Naval College, Portsmouth, where he had ample opportunities for the study of his favourite marine subjects. Following the abolition of the Naval College, he held a similar professorship from 1836 to 1855 at the East India Company's Military Seminary at Addiscombe, Surrey, where the cadets nicknamed him \\"Sepia Jack\\".Vibart 1894, pp. 134‚Äì40. From 1805 to 1872 he contributed periodically to the Royal Academy summer exhibitions, and he was represented at the Westminster Hall competition of 1847 by a large oil painting of the Battle of La Hogue. He was marine painter to George IV, William IV and Queen Victoria. Among his published works were the illustrations to Lord John Manners's Sketches and Notes of a Cruise in Scotch Waters (1850); and a volume entitled Reminiscences of the Veterans of the Sea (1867), which containing photographs of twenty of his paintings and drawings of the great wooden fighting vessels of the Royal Navy. One of his best-known works, the Loss of the Royal George, painted in 1840, is now in Tate Britain.

As a notable nobleman and magnate, Rzewuski held a number of important posts in the administration of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. He was a Field Clerk of the Crown since 1732, voivode of Podole Voivodship between 1736 and 1762 (with a gap between 1750 and 1756). In 1735 he received the prestigious Order of the White Eagle. A brave soldier, since 1752 he held the rank of Field Hetman of the Crown. A Castellan of several notable towns, he was an important politician at the Royal Court in Warsaw and was one of the main supporters of the liberum veto during the Diet of 1764, when he became known for his dispute with Szymon Konarski. During the Diet of 1767 (Repnin Sejm) he opposed Prince Nikolai Repnin's - Russia's ambassador to the Commonwealth - interfering in Poland's domestic affairs. In response, he was kidnapped along with his son Seweryn and two other prominent Polish politicians by Russian agents and imprisoned in Kaluga. Upon his release in April 1773 he was promoted for his merits to the rank of Grand Crown Hetman, but resigned the post in November of that year. Since 1778 he was the Castellan of Krak√≥w and the Voivode of Krak√≥w Voivodship. At the end of his life he was also the Starost of Che≈Çm, U≈Çany, Roman√≥w, Dolina, Drohobycz and Kruszwica.

Biography =Early life= M√ºller was born in Berlin. It was intended that he should study Protestant theology, but from 1798 he devoted himself in G√∂ttingen to the study of law, philosophy, and natural science. He was a student of Gustav Hugo. Returning to Berlin, he was persuaded by his friend Friedrich von Gentz to take up political science. He had early formed a close intimacy with Gentz, his elder by 15 years; and this connection exercised an important influence both on his material circumstances and his mental development in after life. The two men differed widely in character and in their fundamental principles, but agreed, at least in their later period, in their practical political aims, and the friendship was only terminated by death. M√ºller worked for some time as referendary in the Kurm√§rkische Kammer in Berlin. M√ºller's relations with the Junker party and his co-operation with them in their opposition to Hardenberg's reforms made any public employment in Prussia impossible for him. He travelled in Sweden and Denmark, spent about two years in Poland, and then went to Vienna, where he was converted to the Catholic faith on 30 April 1805. Through Gentz he became acquainted with Metternich, to whom he was useful in the preparation of state papers. =Career= From 1806 to 1809, he lived at Dresden occupied in the political education of Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar and lecturer on German literature, dramatic art, and political science. In 1808 he edited with Heinrich von Kleist the periodical Phoebus. In 1809, he returned to Berlin, and in 1811 to Vienna, where he lived in the house of Archduke Maximilian of Austria-Este and became the friend of Clemens Maria Hofbauer. In 1813, he entered the Austrian service, and was appointed imperial commissioner and major of the rifle corps in Tyrol. He took part in the wars for liberty, and later on, as counsellor of the government, in the reorganization of the country. In 1815 he was called to Vienna, and went to Paris with the imperial staff. On the conclusion of peace, he became Austrian consul-general for Saxony at Leipzig, and agent for Anhalt and Schwarzburg. He edited here the periodicals Deutscher Staatsanzeiger (1816‚Äì1818) and Unparteiischer Literatur- und Kirchenkorrespondent. He attended the ministerial conferences at Carlsbad and Vienna (1819‚Äì1820), where, being one of the principal literary instruments of the reaction, he took part in framing the Carlsbad resolutions. In 1826, at the instance of Prince von Metternich, he was ennobled as Ritter von Nittersdorf, was recalled to Vienna (1827), appointed imperial counsellor, and employed in the service of the chancellery. He died in Vienna in 1829, aged 49. Positions and theories Adam Heinrich M√ºller c. 1810 M√ºller was distinguished as a writer not only on politics and economics, but on literature and aesthetics. His chief work is the ' (Elements of Statecraft), originating in lectures delivered before Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar and an assembly of politicians and diplomats at Dresden in the winter, 1808-09. It treats in six books of the state, of right, of the spirit of legislation in antiquity and in the Middle Ages, of money and national wealth, of the economical factors of the state and trade, of the relation between the state and religion. M√ºller was a conservative writer whose vision of the state was one of an absolute power, in contrast to theorists who emphasized the rights of man such as Montesquieu and Rousseau.Eastern Europe: An Historical Geography, 1815-1945 p23 M√ºller endeavoured to comprehend the connexion between political and social science, and, while using the historical method, to base them upon philosophy and religion.Cf. the preface to the first volume of the Elemente, where he treats exhaustively the differences between his work and Montesquieu's '; cf. also the sixth book of this work, and the above-mentioned work of 1820. With Edmund Burke, Friedrich von Gentz, Joseph de Maistre, and Karl Ludwig von Haller, he must be reckoned among the chief opponents of revolutionary ideas in politics. In his work, ' (On the necessity of a comprehensive theological foundation for political science, 1820), M√ºller rejects, like Haller (', 1816), the distinction between constitutional and civil law (common law), which rests entirely on the idea of the state's omnipotence. His ideal is medieval feudalism, on which the reorganization of modern political institutions should be modelled. =Romanticist= In the field of literature and aesthetics, M√ºller belongs to the Romantic school. He is a Romanticist even in his specialty, politics and political economy. As Eichendorff says in his Geschichte der poetischen Literatur Deutschlands (new ed., by W. Kosch, Kempten, 1906, p. 352), M√ºller \\"mapped out a domain of his own, the application of Romanticism to the social and political conditions of life.\\" Carl Schmitt presented the view that \\"it is impossible to judge M√ºller's theory of the state as anything but a matter of aesthetics and style.\\" M√ºller himself declares: \\"The reconciliation of science and art and of their noblest ideas with serious political life was the purpose of my larger works\\" (Vermischte Schriften, I, p. iii). =Economics= His position in political economy is defined by his strong opposition to Adam Smith's system of materialistic-liberal (so-called classical) political economy, or the so-called industry system. He censures Smith as presenting a one-sidedly material and individualistic conception of society, and as being too exclusively English in his views. M√ºller is thus also an adversary of free trade. In contrast with the economical individualism of Adam Smith, he emphasizes the ethical element in national economy, the duty of the state toward the individual, and the religious basis which is also necessary in this field. M√ºller's importance in the history of political economy is acknowledged even by the opponents of his religious and political point of view. His reaction against Adam Smith, says Roscher (Geschichte der National-√ñkonomik, p. 763), \\"is not blind or hostile, but is important, and often truly helpful.\\" Some of his ideas, freed from much of their alloy, are reproduced in the writings of the historical school of German economists. The reactionary and feudalistic thought in M√ºller's writings, which agreed so little with the spirit of the times, prevented his political ideas from exerting a more notable and lasting influence on his age, while their religious character prevented them from being justly appreciated. However, M√ºller's teachings had long-term effects in that they were taken up again by 20th century theorists of corporatism and the corporate state, for example Othmar Spann (Der wahre Staat. Vorlesungen √ºber Abbruch und Neubau der Gesellschaft, Vienna, 1921). Writings M√ºller was a man of great and versatile talents, an excellent orator, and a suggestive writer. Several of his works were based upon his own lectures; the most important (besides the above-mentioned periodicals) are: *Die Lehre vom Gegensatz (Berlin, 1804) *Vorlesungen √ºber die deutsche Wissenschaft und Literatur (Dresden, 1806, 2nd ed., 1807) *Von der Idee der Sch√∂nheit (lectures; Berlin, 1809) *Die Elemente der Staatskunst (lectures; 3 parts, Berlin, 1809) *√úber K√∂nig Friedrich II. und die Natur, W√ºrde und Bestimmung der preu√üischen Monarchie (lectures; Berlin, 1810) *Die Theorie der Staatshaushaltung und ihre Forschritte in Deutschland und England seit Adam Smith (2 vols., Vienna, 1812) *Vermischte Schriften √ºber Staat, Philosophie und Kunst (2 vols., Vienna, 1812; 2nd ed., 1817) *Versuch einer neuen Theorie des Geldes, mit besonderer R√ºcksicht auf Gro√übritannien (Leipzig, 1816) *Zw√∂lf Reden √ºber die Beredsamkeit und deren Verfall in Deutschland (Leipzig, 1817) *Die Fortschritte der national√∂konomischen Wissenschaft in England (Leipzig, 1817) *Von der Notwendigkeit einer theologischen Grundlage der gesamten Staatswissenschaften und der Staatswirtschaft insbesondere (Leipzig, 1820; new ed., Vienna, 1898) *Die Gewerbe-Polizei in Beziehung auf den Landbau (Leipzig, 1824) *Vorschlag zu einem historischen Ferien-Cursus (Vienna, 1829) A critical pamphlet, which was written in 1817 on the occasion of the Protestant jubilee of the Reformation and entitled, Etwas, das Goethe gesagt hat. Beleuchtet von Adam M√ºller. Leipzig, den 31 Oktober 1817, was printed but not published (reprinted in Vienna, 1910). Nevertheless, Traugott Krug's reply, entitled Etwas, das Herr Adam M√ºller gesagt hat √ºber etwas, das Goethe gesagt hat, und noch etwas, das Luther gesagt hat (Leipzig, 1817), appeared in two editions.

It was one of Cirque du Soleil's most popular touring shows. Since it premiered in April 1994, it has been performed over 5,000 times and seen by over 14 million spectators in more than 250 cities around the world. Alegr√≠a originated as a touring big top show. However, beginning with its 2009‚Äì2011 North American tour, the show was converted to an arena format, enabling it to visit cities that were previously inaccessible to the big top tour. Furthermore, Alegr√≠a took a short respite and was converted to a resident show at MGM's Beau Rivage casino from May 1999 to October 2000 before it continued touring again. On 29 December 2013, Alegr√≠a performed its final show at the Lotto Arena in Antwerp, Belgium.

The Old Order has costumes which are reminiscent of New York's Gilded Age as they are finely decorated with feathers, lace, and other adornments. The New Order, on the other hand, representing the youth of tomorrow, have the same rich hues as the old order, while the fabrics used are lighter and softer, helping to emphasize the agility of youth. Music The original album artwork of Alegr√≠a, 1994 The soundtrack was composed by Ren√© Dup√©r√©, who had composed for previous productions including Nouvelle Exp√©rience, Saltimbanco and Myst√®re. It was released as a studio album on 27 September 1994. Robbi Finkel and Ren√© Dup√©r√© were nominated for a Grammy Award as Best Arranger at the 38th Annual Grammy Awards. The album was also nominated for several F√©lix Awards in 1995, winning two of the latter: 'Producer of the Year' for Robbi Finkel and Ren√© Dup√©r√©, and 'Sound Mixer of the Year' for Rob Heaney.

It is named after Henri Poincar√© and Heinz Hopf. The Poincar√©‚ÄìHopf theorem is often illustrated by the special case of the hairy ball theorem, which simply states that there is no smooth vector field on a even-dimensional n-sphere having no sources or sinks. According to the Poincare-Hopf theorem, closed trajectories can encircle two centres and one saddle or one centre, but never just the saddle. (Here for in case of a Hamiltonian system) Formal statement Let M be a differentiable manifold, of dimension n, and v a vector field on M. Suppose that x is an isolated zero of v, and fix some local coordinates near x. Pick a closed ball D centered at x, so that x is the only zero of v in D. Then the index of v at x, \\\\operatorname{index}_x(v), can be defined as the degree of the map u : \\\\partial D \\\\to \\\\mathbb S^{n-1} from the boundary of D to the (n-1)-sphere given by u(z)=v(z)/\\\\v(z)\\\\. Theorem. Let M be a compact differentiable manifold. Let v be a vector field on M with isolated zeroes. If M has boundary, then we insist that v be pointing in the outward normal direction along the boundary. Then we have the formula :\\\\sum_i \\\\operatorname{index}_{x_i}(v) = \\\\chi(M)\\\\, where the sum of the indices is over all the isolated zeroes of v and \\\\chi(M) is the Euler characteristic of M. A particularly useful corollary is when there is a non-vanishing vector field implying Euler characteristic 0. The theorem was proven for two dimensions by Henri Poincar√© and later generalized to higher dimensions by Heinz Hopf. Significance The Euler characteristic of a closed surface is a purely topological concept, whereas the index of a vector field is purely analytic. Thus, this theorem establishes a deep link between two seemingly unrelated areas of mathematics. It is perhaps as interesting that the proof of this theorem relies heavily on integration, and, in particular, Stokes' theorem, which states that the integral of the exterior derivative of a differential form is equal to the integral of that form over the boundary. In the special case of a manifold without boundary, this amounts to saying that the integral is 0. But by examining vector fields in a sufficiently small neighborhood of a source or sink, we see that sources and sinks contribute integer amounts (known as the index) to the total, and they must all sum to 0. This result may be considered one of the earliest of a whole series of theorems establishing deep relationships between geometric and analytical or physical concepts. They play an important role in the modern study of both fields. Sketch of proof 1\\\\. Embed M in some high-dimensional Euclidean space. (Use the Whitney embedding theorem.) 2\\\\. Take a small neighborhood of M in that Euclidean space, NŒµ. Extend the vector field to this neighborhood so that it still has the same zeroes and the zeroes have the same indices. In addition, make sure that the extended vector field at the boundary of NŒµ is directed outwards. 3\\\\. The sum of indices of the zeroes of the old (and new) vector field is equal to the degree of the Gauss map from the boundary of NŒµ to the sphere. Thus, the sum of the indices is independent of the actual vector field, and depends only on the manifold M. Technique: cut away all zeroes of the vector field with small neighborhoods. Then use the fact that the degree of a map from the boundary of an n-dimensional manifold to an sphere, that can be extended to the whole n-dimensional manifold, is zero. 4\\\\. Finally, identify this sum of indices as the Euler characteristic of M. To do that, construct a very specific vector field on M using a triangulation of M for which it is clear that the sum of indices is equal to the Euler characteristic.  Generalization  It is still possible to define the index for a vector field with nonisolated zeroes. A construction of this index and the extension of Poincar√©‚ÄìHopf theorem for vector fields with nonisolated zeroes is outlined in Section 1.1.2 of .

The show combined elements of traditional Chinese circus with Western contemporary circus, complementing the \\"East-meets-West\\" theme implied in the title ‚Äî the name is a portmanteau of \\"dragon\\" (representing the East) and \\"lion\\" (representing the West). It is Cirque du Soleil's 12th touring production and the first Cirque show since 1985 not to be directed by Franco Dragone.Cirque du Soleil - About Dralion Dralion performed its final show at the Sullivan Arena in Anchorage, Alaska on January 18, 2015, bringing its 15-year world tour to a close.  Set and technical information  The backdrop for Dralion was a metallic structure in width and in height. It was covered in perforated aluminum tiles, giving it the appearance of medieval armor or a futuristic Chinese temple. Sitting atop the structure were six giant claws which allow performers to climb the wall and suspend in mid-air. Above the stage itself were three large concentric aluminum rings. The first was utilized as a catwalk; the second was used to support acrobatic equipment; and the third is used by performers to move up and down and suspend in the air. Portions of the Dralion stage were redesigned and incorporated into the Ovo arena tour in early 2016. Characters Dralion featured 50 members in its performance troupe, of which about 5 or 6 play principal characters. *Azala (air): The goddess of air who is dressed in blue, keeper of the sun and the guardian of immortality. *Gaya (earth): The goddess of earth, dressed in ochre. *Oc√©ane (water): The goddess of water, dressed in green. *Yao (fire): The god of fire, dressed in red, who is both good and evil. *L'√Çme Force: The show's singers who symbolize harmony between the four elements. *Kala: Represents the heart of the wheel of time, making time evolve. *King Bamboo: Represents the force of Fire. *Hibana: A Fire Princess. *Little Buddha: The chosen child who possesses powers that will eventually allow him to become an √Çme-Force, but dreams of being a regular child. *Shine: The lover of the air goddess Azala. *Dralions: Mythical creatures inspired by the imagery of the Chinese lion dance and dragon dance. (performed by members of Chinese house troupe) *Water Nymphs: A group of young girls dress in green, they follow the order of Oc√©ane. *Giovanni: A small but nimble man. (1999-2015) *Giovanna: A female version of Giovanni portrayed by Jessica Green. (2003) *The Fools: The original clowns of Dralion consisting of Robert Jette, Ben Amar-Djalal, Aline Muheim, and Philippe Delaitre. (1999) *Les Voila: A duo of bizarre clowns consisting of Johnny Filion and Soizick Hebert. (1999-2001) *The Mad Italian Waiters: Strange foreigners from a far off land. (2001-2015) Acts The acts of Dralion combine unique western and eastern acrobatic skills. *Dance of the Elements: The show began with the goddesses and god of the four elements dancing. *Single Handbalancing: A single woman balances on one hand and accomplishes a variety of poses. *Bamboo Poles: Five acrobats twirl and throw bamboo poles while Yao waves a flag as the acrobats jump over it. *Juggling: An artist performs juggling infused with breakdancing and modern dance. This act was performed by Viktor Kee but now is performed by Vladik Myagkostoupov. *Trampoline: Surrounding Oc√©ane, a group of acrobats perform on trampolines using the set's futuristic backdrop both as a diving board and landing pad. *Crossed Cyr Wheel: A cyr wheel that is infused with another cyr wheel forming a globe. The performer spins and twists this apparatus in an act that represents the circle of life and the passing of time. *Dralions: Three acrobats and three Dralions perform tumbling feats and Chinese lion dance-like dance. *Medusa: A group of artists execute graceful and lithe movements, in the style of acrosport. *Aerial Hoop: A single artist performs choreography using a hoop suspended in mid-air. *Diabolo: Artists perform tricks with diabolos trying to outperform each other. *Aerial Pas de Deux: Azala and her male counterpart perform an aerial dance in silks. *Hoop Diving: Acrobats jump through a tower of hoops, which is sometimes spinning. *Skipping Ropes: A group of acrobats perform jump rope alone or together in pyramids and in towers. =Rotation acts= *Contortion: A solo act featuring a very flexible performer who stays in handstands with their legs over their head. *Aerial Straps: Used commonly in place of Aerial Pas de Deux. =Retired acts= *Contortion with Bowls: This was a contortion act made even more precarious with the added difficulty of balancing a stack of bowls on the artists head. *Teeterboard: An original Dralion act, it featured an all female troupe. The flyer would stand at one end of the trapeze as two performers jumped onto the opposite end, shooting the flyer up and onto a high tower of other performers. *Ballet on Lightbulbs: An original Dralion act that was unlike anything else. A group of female artists wore ballet pointe shoes and balanced while other performers climbed onto their shoulders creating high towers of people all on a platform of light bulbs. *Double Duplex Trapeze: An original Dralion act, two trapezes that had one bar at the bottom and another bar about a metre above it, the artists would jump or flip from the higher bar into the hands of another performer at the bottom bar. *Foot Juggling: An original Dralion act, this foot juggling act featured a female artist who manipulated and spun an open Chinese parasol on her feet, at one moment she would have a parasol on each foot and each hand, all spinning simultaneously. *Balancing on Chairs: This act had an artist stack a pile if chairs, at the top of the pile the artist performed a hand-balancing act. *Spirits: Four couples perform a gravity-defying ballet. Costumes Dralion's costumes are vibrant in color; inspired by clothing from India, China, and Africa; and are shaped according to the movements of each performer's choreography. In total there are around 1500 wardrobe pieces for the show, taking into account that some artists have up to four costume changes during a single performance. * Yao: As the symbol of fire, Yao is clad in red and inspired by Chinese. * Oc√©ane: As the goddess of water, Oc√©ane's costume is Indian inspired and green in color. * Azala: As the goddess of air, Azala's primary color is blue.

Suggs attended high school at William Fleming High School. During his 1998 senior year in high school, he rushed for 2,918 yards and 30 touchdowns, capping a prolific high school career and helping boost his ranking among running backs to fourth in the state and 19th in the nation, according to the SuperPrep scouting organization. While at Virginia Tech he set, and still holds the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision records for most games scoring a touchdown in a single season (14 games in 2002), and for most consecutive games scoring a touchdown (27 consecutive games, from September 2, 2000 through December 31, 2002; 57 touchdowns). His accomplishments at the university earned him a spot in the Virginia Tech Sports Hall of Fame. Suggs was drafted by the Cleveland Browns with the 18th pick in the fourth round and 115th overall of the 2003 NFL Draft. He was unable to play a full season due to several injuries as well as the acquisition of Reuben Droughns. On Monday, August 14, 2006, Suggs was traded to the New York Jets for defensive back Derrick Strait, but the trade was voided when Suggs failed his physical, and subsequently returned to the Browns. He was then subsequently cut by the Browns. Suggs was claimed off waivers by the Miami Dolphins on September 3, 2006. He was released by the Dolphins on October 10, 2006. Suggs is currently the quarterbacks coach for Division III Catholic University of America. His coaching career began at Oberlin College in 2008 as running backs coach.

The 60-minute documentary, which was filmed in black-and-white, features footage of the band recording many of the tracks that made the album, and tracks that didn't make the album although would be released as singles and b-sides (such as \\"Soul to Squeeze\\" and \\"Sikamikanico\\"). It also features interviews from each member of the band, as well as Rick Rubin and the band's former and longtime manager, Lindy Goetz. Footage from the documentary was compiled for use in the \\"Suck My Kiss\\" music video, which was released in 1992. Funky Monks was originally released on VHS but was re-released on DVD. It was filmed and directed by Gavin Bowden. On July 16, 2011, NME voted Funky Monks the 14th must see rock documentary on their 20 must see rock documentaries list. Unreleased version, bonus footage In 2013, a first edit cut of the documentary containing over 18 minutes of footage not included in the released version was released onto YouTube. The newly released footage includes scenes of the band recording \\"They're Red Hot\\", \\"Search and Destroy\\", \\"Sikamikanico\\" and \\"Soul to Squeeze\\". Some of the footage is extended from the released version. It has been widely believed for years a 3-hour cut of the documentary exists. Footage not from the released documentary has been used in other forms of media such as television interviews and documentaries on the band. Rare color footage was also used at the time for various interviews including ones with MTV. A VH-1 documentary contained unseen footage featuring an unreleased song from the Blood Sugar Sex Magik recording sessions that has yet to be identified.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0tTJ4SakE0https://sites.google.com/site/rhcpsessions/holy- grails References External links * Category:1992 films Category:American documentary films Category:American films Category:Red Hot Chili Peppers video albums Category:Rockumentaries ","title":"Funky Monks"},{"id":"1267297","text":"Baron Axel Fredrik Cronstedt (/kroonstet/ 23 December 1722 ‚Äì 19 August 1765) was a Swedish mineralogist and chemist who discovered the element nickel in 1751 as a mining expert with the Bureau of Mines. Cronstedt is considered a founder of modern mineralogy,Nordisk familjebok ‚Äì Cronstedt: \\"den moderna mineralogiens och geognosiens grundl√§ggare\\" = \\"the modern mineralogy's and geognosie's founder\\" for introducing the blowpipe as a tool for mineralogists, and for proposing that the mineral kingdom be organized on the basis of chemical analysis in his book F√∂rs√∂k til mineralogie, eller mineral-rikets upst√§llning (‚ÄúAn attempt at mineralogy or arrangement of the Mineral Kingdom‚Äù, 1758). Life Axel Fredrik Cronstedt was born on 23 December 1722 on the estate of Str√∂psta, in Sudermania. His father, Gabriel Olderman Cronstedt (1670‚Äì1757), was a military engineer. His mother, Maria Elizabeth Adlersberg, was Gabriel Cronstedt's second wife. Beginning in 1738, Axel Cronstedt was an unregistered student at the University of Uppsala, hearing lectures with Johan Gottschalk Wallerius (1709‚Äì1785), professor of chemistry, and astronomer Anders Celsius (1701‚Äì1744). At Uppsala, he became a friend of Sven Rinman, discoverer of Rinman‚Äôs green. In 1743, during an unstable period politically, Cronstedt left Uppsala to act as his father's secretary on a military tour of inspection. This tour strengthened his interest in mines and mineralogy. Cronstedt entered the School of Mines where his instructors included geologist Daniel Tilas (1712-1772). On Tilas' recommendation, Cronstedt went on mining tours in the summers of 1744 and 1745. In 1746, he surveyed copper mines. From 1746‚Äì1748 Cronstedt took classes with George Brandt, the discoverer of cobalt, at the royal mining laboratory in Stockholm, the Laboratorium Chemicum. There he studied chemical analysis and smelting. Between 1748, when he completed his studies, and 1758, Cronstedt held a variety of positions. In 1756, he was disappointed to be passed over for a position at the Bureau of Mines, but in 1758, he became a superintendent of mining operations for the mining districts of √ñster and V√§sterbergslagen. In 1760 Cronstedt married Gertrud Charlotta S√∂derhielm (1728‚Äì1769). In 1761, he moved to the estate of Nisshytte, north of Riddarhyttan. He died there on 19 August 1765. Research Kit for blowpipe analysis Carl Osterland, Freiberg, c. 1870 Cronstedt initiated the use of the blowpipe for the analysis of minerals. Originally a goldsmith's tool, it became widely used for the identification of small ore samples, particularly in Sweden where his contemporaries had seen Cronstedt use it. Use of the blowpipe enabled mineralogists to discover eleven new elements, beginning with Cronstedt's discovery of nickel. John Joseph Griffin credits Cronstedt as \\"the first person of eminence who used the blowpipe\\" and \\"the founder of Mineralogy\\" in A Practical Treatise on the Use of the Blowpipe (1827). Scheelite Cronstedt discovered the mineral now known as scheelite in 1751 at Bispberg Klack, later obtaining samples from the Kuhschacht mine in Freiberg, Germany. He gave it the name tungsten, meaning \\"heavy stone\\" in Swedish. Thirty years later, Carl Wilhelm Scheele determined that scheelite was in fact an ore, and that a new metal could be extracted from it. This element then became known by Cronstedt's name, tungsten. Mine building at Los Nickel Cronstedt also extracted the element nickel from ores in the cobalt mines of Los, Sweden. The ore was described by miners as kupfernickel because it had a similar appearance to copper (kupfer) and a mischievous sprite (nickel) was supposed by miners to be the cause of their failure to extract copper from it. Cronstedt presented his research on nickel to the Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1751 and 1754. Decades later, some scientists still argued that it was a mixture, and not a new metal, but its nature was eventually accepted. In 1756, Cronstedt coined the term zeolite after heating the mineral stilbite with a blowpipe flame. He was the first to describe its distinctive properties, having observed the \\"frothing\\" when heated with a blowpipe. Blowpipe, from An essay towards a system of mineralogy, 1770 Cronstedt's book F√∂rs√∂k til mineralogie, eller mineral-rikets upst√§llning (‚ÄúAn attempt at mineralogy or arrangement of the Mineral Kingdom‚Äù, 1758) was originally published anonymously. In it, Cronstedt proposed that minerals be classified on the basis of chemical analysis of their composition. He was surprised that others supported his ideas and put them into practice. It was translated into English by Gustav Von Engestr√∂m (1738-1813) as An essay towards a system of mineralogy (1770). Engestr√∂m added an appendix, \\"Description and Use of a Mineralogical Pocket Laboratory; and especially the Use of the Blow-pipe in Mineralogy\\", which brought considerable attention to Cronstedt's use of the blowpipe. Cronstedt noted in F√∂rs√∂k til mineralogie, eller mineral-rikets upst√§llning that he had observed an ‚Äúunidentified earth‚Äù in a heavy red stone from the Bastn√§s mine in Riddarhyttan. Forty-five years later, J√∂ns Jacob Berzelius and Wilhelm Hisinger isolated the first element of the lanthanide series of the rare earth elements, cerium, in ore from the mine. Awards and Honors In 1753, Cronstedt was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

The largest protest occurred in central London on Saturday 31 March 1990, shortly before the tax was due to come into force in England and Wales. Background The advent of the poll tax was due to an effort to alter the way the tax system was used to fund local government in the UK. The system in place until this time was called \\"rates\\" and had been in place in some form from the beginning of the 17th century. The rates system has been described as \\"a levy on property, which in modern times saw each taxpayer paying a rate based on the estimated rental value of their home\\". 1989 The Thatcher government had long promised to replace domestic rates, which were unpopular, especially among Conservative voters. They were seen by many as an unfair way of raising revenue for local councils. It was levied on houses rather than people. The proposed replacement was a flat-rate per capita Community Charge‚Äî\\"a head tax that saw every adult pay a fixed rate amount set by their local authority\\". The new Charge was widely called a \\"poll tax\\" and was introduced in Scotland in 1989 and in England and Wales a year later. The Charge proved extremely unpopular; while students and the registered unemployed had to pay 20%, some large families occupying relatively small houses saw their charges go up considerably, and the tax was thus accused of saving the rich money and moving the expenses onto the poor. Dario Fo play of that name. In November 1989 the All Britain Anti-Poll Tax Federation was set up by the Militant tendency. Other groups such as the 3D () network provided national coordination for anti-poll tax unions who were not aligned to particular political factions. The All Britain Federation called a demonstration in London for 31 March 1990 which all of the major networks organised for. Three days before the event, organisers realised the march would be larger than 60,000 (the capacity of Trafalgar Square) and asked permission from the MPS and the Department of the Environment to divert the march to Hyde Park. The request was deniedChannel 4 Critical Eye documentary, \\"Battle of Trafalgar\\", 9 July 1990, Despite TV on the basis that the policing had been arranged for Trafalgar Square and there was no time to re-plan it. A building site on Trafalgar Square with easily accessible supplies of bricks and scaffolding was left largely unsecured while the police set up their centre of operations on the other side of the square. Events of the day Peaceful anti-poll tax protesters outside the Palace of Westminster on the afternoon of 31 March, before the rioting began. On 31 March 1990, people began gathering in Kennington Park from noon. Turnout was encouraged by fine weather, and between 180,000 and 250,000 arrived. The police report, a year after the riot, estimated the crowd at 200,000. An abandoned rally by the Labour Party may also have contributed to the number of protesters. The march began at Kennington Park at 1:30pm, moving faster than planned because some of the crowd had forced open the gates of the park, presumably in order to avoid being forced through smaller gates. This split the march over both sides of the road, and protesters continued in much the same way for the rest of the route. By 2:30pm, Trafalgar Square was nearing its capacity. Unable to continue moving easily into Trafalgar Square, at about 3pm the march stopped in Whitehall. The police, worried about a surge towards the new security gates of Downing Street, blocked the top and bottom of Whitehall, and lined the pavement refusing to let people leave the road. Additional police units were dispatched to reinforce the officers manning the barrier blocking the Downing Street side of Whitehall. The section of the march which stopped opposite Downing Street reportedly contained veteran anarchists and a group called \\"Bikers Against The Poll Tax\\", some of whom became aggravated by reportedly heavy-handed arrests, including one of a man in a wheelchair. Mounted riot police were brought in behind this immobilised section of the march, in theory to clear the protesters from Whitehall, despite both retreat and advance being blocked by further lines of police. Meanwhile, the tail-end had been diverted at the Parliament Square end of Whitehall, and the anarchists it had attracted were at the head of an unpoliced portion of the march. These people walked to Richmond Terrace, bringing the diverted march into Whitehall, opposite Downing Street and behind the police lines on that side of Whitehall. The protesters at the rear of the stationary group, being faced by mounted police seemingly preparing to charge, sat down on the road for safety. Despite black-clothed and scarf-masked people running through seemingly from behind the police lines and urging them up, they remained seated until physically dragged away and arrested for \\"obstructing Whitehall\\". The mounted police then advanced at speed, forcing the Whitehall section of the march to fight its way into Trafalgar Square. From 4pm, with the rally nearly officially over, contradictory reports began to arise. According to some sources, mounted riot police (officially used in an attempt to clear Whitehall of protesters) charged out of a side street into the crowd in Trafalgar Square. Whether intentional or not, this was interpreted by the crowd as a provocation, fueling anger in the Square where the police had already been pushing sections of crowd back into corners, leaving no way out except through the police. At 4:30pm, four shielded police riot vans drove into the crowd (a tactic in dealing with mass demonstrations at the time) outside the South African Embassy, attempting to force through to the entrance to Whitehall where police were re-grouping. The crowd attacked the vans with wooden staves and scaffolding poles. Soon after, rioting began to escalate. By 4:30pm police had closed the main Underground stations in the area and southern exits of Trafalgar Square, making it difficult for people to disperse. Coaches had been parked south of the river, so many marchers tried to move south. At this point, Militant Fed stewards were withdrawn on police orders. Sections of the crowd, including unemployed coal miners, climbed scaffolding and rained debris on the police below. At 5pm, builders' cabins below the scaffolding caught fire, followed by a room in the South African Embassy on the other side of the Square. The smoke from the fires caused near darkness in the Square and produced a 20-minute lull in rioting. Damage, including a broken shop window, caused during the rioting on Trafalgar Square. Between 6 and 7pm, the police opened the southern exits of the Square and slowly moved people out of Trafalgar Square. A large section of the crowd was moved back down Northumberland Avenue and allowed over the River Thames in order to return to their organised transport. Two other sections of demonstrators, now very angry and aggravated, were pushed north into the wealthy shopping streets of West End, which suffered reported theft and vandalism. Published accounts detail shop windows being broken, goods looted, and cars being overturned in Piccadilly Circus, Oxford Street, Regent Street, Charing Cross Road, and Covent Garden. Police ordered pubs to close. The demonstrators mixed in with the general public. By midnight, released figures claimed 113 were injured, mostly members of the public, but also police officers; and 339 people had been arrested. Scuffles between rioters and police continued until 3am. Rioters attacked numerous shops, most notably Stringfellow's nightclub, and car showrooms; and Covent Garden caf√©s and wine bars were set ablaze, along with motor vehicles. Responses The response of the Metropolitan Police, the Government, the Labour Party and the labour movement and some of the Marxist and Trotskyist left, notably the Militant tendency, was to condemn the riot as senseless and to blame anarchists. Tommy Sheridan of Scottish Militant Labour condemned the protesters. The next day, Steve Nally, also a Socialist Party member and Secretary of the All Britain Anti-Poll Tax Federation, said that they would \\"hold an enquiry and name names\\". Many others denounced the All Britain Anti-Poll Tax Federation position and defended those who fought back against the police attacks. Danny Burns (secretary of the Avon Federation of anti-Poll Tax Unions)https://libcom.org/history/poll-tax-rebellion-danny- burns for example said: \\"Often attack is the only effective form of defence and, as a movement, we should not be ashamed or defensive about these actions, we should be proud of those who did fight back.\\"\\"Poll Tax rebellion\\", AK Press 1992, p. 116. The UK Socialist Workers' Party (SWP), which was blamed for the violence by some in the media and by Labour MP George Galloway, refused to condemn protesters, calling the events a \\"police riot\\". Pat Stack, then a member of the SWP's Central Committee, told The Times: \\"We did not go on the demonstration with any intention of fighting with the police, but we understand why people are angry and we will not condemn that anger.\\" A 1991 police report concluded there was \\"no evidence that the trouble was orchestrated by left-wing anarchist groups\\". Afterwards, the non-aligned Trafalgar Square Defendants Campaign was set up, committed to unconditional support for the defendants, and to accountability to the defendants. The Campaign acquired more than 50 hours of police video. Use of these was influential in acquitting many of the 491 defendants, suggesting the police had fabricated or inflated charges. In March 1991, the police report suggested additional contributing internal police factors: squeezed overtime budgets which led to the initial deployment of 2,000 men, insufficient given the number of demonstrators; a lack of riot shields (400 \\"short\\" riot shields were available); and erratic or poor-quality radio, with a lag of up to five minutes in the computerised switching of radio messages during the evening West End rioting. Prime Minister Thatcher was at a conference of the Conservative Party Council in Cheltenham; the poll tax was the focus of the conference‚Äîas coverage of the demonstrations unfolded, speculation developed for the first time about Thatcher's position as leader. Abolition of the tax The national opposition to the poll tax (especially vehement in the north of England and Scotland) was the major factor; an opinion poll had found 78% opposed to it. John Major announced in his first parliamentary speech as Prime Minister that the poll tax was to be replaced by Council Tax. The council tax came into effect in 1992. Similar to the previous system of rates, the new system set tax levels on property value. Although it was not directly linked to income, the council tax took ability to pay into consideration, unlike the poll tax.

Franz Anton Schiefner (June 18, 1817 ‚Äì November 16, 1879) was a Baltic German linguist and tibetologist. Schiefner was born to a German-speaking family in Reval (Tallinn), Estonia, then part of Russian Empire. His father was a merchant who had emigrated from Bohemia. He was educated first at the Reval grammar school, matriculated at St Petersburg as a law student in 1836, and subsequently at Berlin, from 1840 to 1842, where he devoted himself exclusively to studies of Eastern languages. On his return to St Petersburg in 1843 he taught classics in the First Grammar School, and soon afterwards received a post in the Imperial Academy, where in 1852 the cultivation of the Tibetan language and literature was assigned to him as a special function. From 1860 to 1873 he simultaneously held the professorship of classical languages in the Saint Petersburg Roman Catholic Theological Academy. From 1854 until his death he was an extraordinary member of the Imperial Academy. He visited England three times for purposes of research in 1863, 1865 and 1878. Schiefner made his mark in literary research in three directions. First, he contributed to the Memoirs and Bulletin of the St Petersburg Academy, and brought out independently a number of valuable articles and larger publications on the language and literature of Tibet. He possessed also a remarkable acquaintance with the Mongolian, and when death overtook him had just finished a revision of the New Testament in that language with which the British and Foreign Bible Society had entrusted him. Further, he was one of the greatest authorities on the philology and ethnology of the Finnic languages. He edited and translated the great Finnish epic Kalevala into German; he arranged, completed and brought out in twelve volumes the literary remains of Matthias Alexander Castr√©n, bearing on the languages of the Samoyedic tribes, the Koibal, Karagass, Tungusic, Buryat, Ostyak and Kottic tongues, and prepared several valuable papers on Finnic mythology for the Imperial Academy. In the third place, he investigated the languages of the Caucasus, which his lucid analyses placed within reach of European philologists. Thus he gave a full analysis of the Tush language, and in quick succession, from Baron Peter von Uslar's investigations, comprehensive papers on the Avar, Udi, Abkhaz, Chechen, Kasi-Kumuk, and Hyrcanian languages. He had also mastered Ossetic, and brought out a number of translations from that language, several of them accompanied by the original text. He died in Saint Petersburg.

Held in a custom theatre at the Treasure Island Hotel and Casino, the show was first performed on 25 December 1993, making it the company's longest running show. As with many Cirque du Soleil productions, Myst√®re features a mixture of circus skills, dance, elaborate sets, opera, worldbeat music, and street theatre-style comedy. Featuring a musical score composed by Ren√© Dup√©r√© and Beno√Æt Jutras, the show was created under the direction of Franco Dragone. History The idea for Myst√®re started around 1990. It was originally planned for Caesars Palace with a theme based on Greek and Roman mythology. The plan, however, was scrapped by the casino executives, who thought the project would be too financially risky. Myst√®re was very different from the typical material they were used to in a Las Vegas show. According to Myst√®re set designer Michel Cr√™te, \\"Vegas... was still very influenced by Folies Berg√®re, with the scarves, feather boas, etc. There was a European culture already in place, oddly enough, not an American one. The people who opened the door for something new were Siegfried and Roy. They were the first to move away from the Folies Berg√®re thing.\\" Treasure Island picked up the show three years later. Myst√®re was their first show that would have its own theater, rather than touring with a circus tent. Myst√®re would have a permanent base in Las Vegas. They worked with Mirage Casino-Hotel to produce a show. Recent milestones Myst√®re has achieved include: * Myst√®re celebrated their 20th anniversary on 25 December 2013 * Myst√®re celebrated their 10,000th show on 27 December 2014. * Myst√®re celebrated their 11,111th show on 17 May 2017.https://www.instagram.com/p/BUL6rZ6lh2_/ Set and technical information The theater is a unique theater built in the Treasure Island Hotel and Casino specifically for the show. The design of the theater was created by Michel Cr√™te and that of Montreal-based team of Sc√©no Plus. This theater seats 1,541 audience members. The stage measures 120 feet by 70 feet deep and covers approximately 10,032 square feet. The stage floor is made of a layer of Base Mat, which is rubber made from recycled old tires and sneakers. This helps give the stage some bounce for tumbling. This is held together by polyurethane adhesive and covered with thousands of gallons of liquid that dries onto the surface. The Downstage D Lift is 36 feet in diameter and includes a 28-foot revolving stage. The revolving stage rotates up to 10 revolutions per minute. Props, equipment, and performers are elevated to stage level from the basement or trap by four moving lifts. These moving lifts were constructed in Montreal and then assembled in Las Vegas, NV. The snail seen growing larger throughout the show is called Alice. By the end of the show, she is a giant inflatable puppet controlled by four puppeteers from the inside. The puppeteers move her around by following markings on the floor, since they can not see outside the puppet. They also control her eyes, torso, and tail. The taiko drums in Myst√®re are created by the Japanese company Asano Taiko, located in Matt≈ç, Ishikawa Prefecture. The largest drum in Myst√®re is the ≈çdaiko, which is in diameter and in length, and weighs half a ton. Due to the large size of the drum, it had to be brought into the theatre during construction. Since the completion of the theatre the drum can not be removed, as no door is large enough to accommodate it. Characters The cast of Myst√®re comprises a myriad of fantastic and mysterious characters. * Inti X & Y (Spermatos/Spermatites): A comic chorus representing the seeds of life. * Red Bird (The Firebird): Convinced he can fly. * The Archangels (Les Laquais): The \\"lackeys\\" of Myst√®re who serve and support others. They perform in the Korean plank act. * Brian Le Petit: A troublemaker who steals people's popcorn and causes chaos both onstage and off. (2000‚Äìpresent) * Chanteuses Plumes: A duo of muses who sing the emotion of all humans. * The Firebirds: Along with the Double Faces, they perform the Chinese pole act. * Les √âpouvantables (Les B√©b√©s): Two enormous babies on a quest for nourishment. There's Big Baby (also known as B√©b√© Fran√ßois) and the Baby Girl. * Egon Egli: A strange, lanky, bespectacled youth who rides across the stage on his bicycle. He was the original third baby; no longer in the show. * La Vache √† lait: Protector of youth and a symbol of fertility. When he sounds his horn, it heralds a new beginning. * Moha-Samedi: A man in pink, named after the first day of the new millennium. He is the narrator no one listens to. * La Belle: Afraid of ugliness, she seeks to avoid pain at all costs. * The Black Virgin (Black Widow): The antithesis of La Belle. She represents a praying mantis who destroys the illusions and dreams of her victims. * The Pets (Birds of Prey): These unpredictable birds soar and fly throughout the world of Myst√®re. They are graceful, yet aggressive when hungry. * The Frog: Creepy characters witness to the strength of birth and time. * The Green Lizards: Mischievous and skittish chameleons. There is the Male Chameleon and the Female Chameleon. * The Asicots (Double Faces): These two-faced creatures perform in the Chinese pole act. * Les Palmiers (The Palmtrees): Out of a purple-blue mist, these tropical ladies float by. * Deus ex machina: The machine that regulates the existence of everything. * The Tribe (Les Pagnes): The primitive, tragic ghosts of modern humanity. They descend from the skies to provide the earthly beat of our journey. They welcome us, and they bid us farewell. * The Prince of the Darkness: The prince of the dark side of Myst√®re, performed by Miguel Godreau from 1993 to 1994; he left the show for health reasons and is no longer in the show. * La Banane: A yellow creature with a large, bulbous head that performed with some artists from 1993 to 1995; no longer in the show. * The Shaman: A mysterious man who creates the sounds of the world; no longer in the show. * Bungee Warrior: A duo of muscle men able to fly in the air. * The Jugglers: A trio of jugglers that performed the Manipulation act from 1993 to 1995; no longer in the show. * The Cube Man: Exhibiting great strength and courage, he captures the attention of young souls in search of wonder; no longer in the show. * Gabriel (The Mountain): An archangel who is ready to sacrifice everything. * Mephisto and V√©nus: Part of the Giants race, they are thwarted, twisted creatures. Their presence wreaks havoc in any domain. Together they want to create chaos and destroy the balance that exists within the world of Myst√®re. * The Giants: A gentle race with feathers and long legs. There's the happy-go-lucky Pumpkin Giant, the grumpy Fly Giant, the magnificent Giraffe Giant, the rare Plume Giant (no longer in the show) and the Egg Giant, a delicate interior inside a protective shell. * Yellow Bird/Stas (La Puce): A mischievous imp. * The Medusa: A long-appendaged creature that was part of the original cast between 1993 and 1995; no longer in the show. * The Satyr: A curly-horned creature that was part of the cast from 1997 to 1998; no longer in the show. Also known as The Green Man. * The Doll: A living doll that was part of the original cast between 1993 and 1996, performed by Tony Manducas; no longer in the show. Also known as Tony. * The Zucchinis: Two inflatable marionettes only used in the Net Set-up for the original trapeze act; no longer in the show. *The Egg: An egg-like creature who appeared sometimes during the Overture and Bungee acts from 1993 to 1995; no longer in the show. * Alice the Escargot: An enormous snail. Born from a spring rain, carrier of the souls of the ancestors and herald of the future. * The Toy: The faithful companion of a little girl in search of knowledge. * The Bungees: Like majestic birds in flight, the Bungees dive fearlessly through the air, creating images of unison and separation. * Benny Le Grand: Myst√®res original clown, a mad professor-esque character who was more dark and bitter. He would often cause mischief either by whacking one of the Spermatos with a drumstick, throwing a loaf of bread at the red bird, drenching people with bottled water, interrupting the show as an impromptu tour guide, throwing around silver dollars, popcorn, and women's purses, harassing ticket holders, discouraging guests from seeing the show, or kidnapping an audience member and driving them around in a golf cart. (1993 - 1995, 1996 - 2000) * Alex El Sobrino: Benny Le Grand's Spanish nephew, who was slightly more refined in personality. (1998 - 2000) * Alfredo et Adrenaline: A comedic duo of clowns who had previously appeared in Le Cirque Reinvent√©s European tour, and the special Zirkus Knie show. They often bickered with each other while trying to entertain the audience, from Alfredo trying to perform as a mime, to the two of them throwing paint at each other while trying to perform a song, but they soon literally kissed and made up. (1995 - 1996) Acts Myst√®re features several acrobatic acts, supplemented by clown acts and transitional scenes that advance the storyline. * Aerial straps duo (2017 ‚Äì present): A pair of aerialists performs twists and turns as they fly over the stage. * Chinese poles and hand balancing (2012‚Äìpresent): A group of acrobats climb up, jump between, and slide down four adjacent metal poles while an acrobat contorts into poses on two balancing canes on a platform above the Chinese poles. * Hand-to-hand (1993 ‚Äì present): Two artists perform an exhibition of strength and stamina on a rotating dome. * Bungee (1993 ‚Äì present): A group of artists bounce and swing from the ceiling to the ground and back on bungees. * Teeterboard and power track (2017‚Äìpresent): Artists perform a combination of these two skills. * Taiko (1993 ‚Äì present): A group of artists perform powerful rhythms on Japanese taiko drums. * Flying trapeze (2012 ‚Äì present): Unlike the original version where two separate trapeze towers were surrounded by a platform on one side and an aerial cradle on the other, the current version has a platform on either side. Each trapeze tower now has two trapeze bars swinging beside each other. The act and music were originally from Zed (a resident show at Tokyo Disney Resort) which closed in 2011. =Reserve acts= * Aerial straps (1994, 2002 ‚Äì present) On reserve for the aerial straps duo; features a single artist on straps with the Black Widow or La Belle performing choreography on stage. =Retired acts= * Manipulation (1993 - 1995) * Flying trapeze (1993 - 1995) * Dual high bar (1996 - 2012) * Flying man in silk (1997) * Aerial cube (1996, 1998 ‚Äì 2015) * Chinese poles (1993 - 2011) * Trampoline, fast track, and Korean plank/teeterboard (1993 - 2017) * Aerial straps and cube (2016 ‚Äì 2017) * Aerial silk (2012 ‚Äì 2017) =Acts used in the film Cirque du Soleil: Journey of Man (2000)= * Taiko * Aerial cube * Aerial straps =Acts used in the film Cirque du Soleil: Worlds Away (2012)= * Aerial cube Costumes Dominique Lemieux took inspiration from nature to create the colorful costumes of Myst√®re. One such costume is the Firebird, which has red feathers and accents that give the impression of embers flying through the air. The odd-looking Spermatos and Spermatites are dressed in elongated costumes which bulge in the center and have a tendril-like feature on the head. To give the characters an organic nature, spandex/lycra was used in conjunction with fringes and borders. Music The original score of Myst√®re was composed by Ren√© Dup√©r√©, who had composed all of Cirque du Soleil's earlier shows, including Nouvelle Exp√©rience and Saltimbanco. In 1994 the show's music was released as a studio album featuring the vocals of Canadian singers √âlise Gouin (now known as √âlise Velle) and Nathalie Gauvin. In 1995 the show underwent an artistic overhaul, including changes in the lineup of acts. The \\"manipulation\\" act was replaced by the \\"aerial cube\\", the flying trapeze act by the aerial high bars (the flying trapeze returned in 2012), and the acro net setup dance act was excluded from the show. At the same time the musical score was renovated with assistance from Beno√Æt Jutras, a longtime music director and arranger for Cirque who later went on to compose for Quidam and other Cirque shows. The result, captured in the album Myst√®re: Live in Las Vegas, was a score that reflects the diverse compositional styles of both composers. Myst√®re: Live in Las Vegas is a live, in-house recording of the new score, featuring Nathalie Gauvin and Wendy Talley on vocals; the album was released on November 12, 1996. After the release of the live album, the music was rearranged and altered once again. While the album resembles the current live music closely, it is not identical. For the celebration of the 25th anniversary of the show in 2018, a vinyl album specifically dedicated to the employees was created in limited quantities, just as it was done for the show Alegria in 1994 and Saltimbanco in 1997.

It was designed in 1945 by the Douglas Aircraft Company for the U.S. Navy Bureau of Aeronautics, in conjunction with the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). The Skystreaks were turbojet-powered aircraft that took off from the ground under their own power and had unswept flying surfaces. Development The D558 program was conceived as a joint NACA/U.S. Navy research program for transonic and supersonic flight. As originally envisioned, there would be three phases to the D558 program: a jet-powered airplane, a mixed rocket/jet-powered configuration, and a design and mockup of a combat aircraft. A contract for design and construction of six D558-1 aircraft for the first phase was issued on 22 June 1945. The original plan had been for six aircraft with a mixture of nose and side air inlets and varying wing airfoil sections. That plan was quickly reduced to three aircraft of a single configuration with a nose inlet. Plans for the second phase with mixed rocket/jet propulsion were also dropped. Instead, a new aircraft, the D558-2, was designed with mixed rocket and jet propulsion for supersonic flight. Construction of the first 558-1 began in 1946 and was completed in January 1947. The fuselage used magnesium alloys extensively, while the wings were fabricated from more conventional aluminum alloys. It was made of HK31, which is 3% thorium and 1% zirconium and the rest magnesium, being much lighter then inconel and having a much higher heat capacityYoutube video The Radioactive Alternative To The X-15 - Faster, Higher, Cheaper. The Douglas D-684 The airframe was designed to withstand unusually high loads of up to 18 times gravity due to the uncertainties of transonic flight. The forward fuselage was designed so that it, including the cockpit, could be jettisoned from the aircraft in an emergency. The aircraft was configured to carry more than of test equipment, including sensors (primarily strain gauges and accelerometers) in 400 locations throughout the aircraft. One wing was pierced by 400 small holes to enable aerodynamic pressure data to be collected. The Skystreaks were powered by one Allison J-35-A-11 engine (developed by General Electric as the TG-180) ‚Äî one of the first axial-flow turbojets of American origin ‚Äî and carried 230 US gallons (871 l) of jet fuel (kerosene). Operational history Pilots Carl and Caldwell with a D-558-1 at Muroc, in 1947. All the Skystreaks were initially painted scarlet, which led to the nickname crimson test tube. NACA later had the color of the Skystreaks changed to white to improve optical tracking and photography. The first of three D-558-1 Skystreaks, BuNo 37970, made its maiden flight on 14 April 1947, at Muroc Army Air Field (later named Edwards AFB). Less than 4 months later, on August 20, this aircraft with Commander Turner Caldwell, USN, reached flying D-558-1 #1. This was recognised as an official world air speed record, as the World War II German Me 163B V18 Komet rocket fighter prototype that was claimed to have reached in July 1944 did so in secrecy and not under the strict conditions that regulate official records (presence of FIA officials as observers, timed runs in two directions to cancel out wind speed, etc). The D-558-1 #1 Skystreak's record lasted 5 days, and was broken by then-Lieutenant Colonel Marion Carl, USMC, going faster in D-558-1 #2, BuNo 37971. This aircraft was delivered to the NACA Muroc Flight Test Unit in April 1949 after 101 flights had been completed by the Navy, Air Force, and Douglas. This aircraft was never flown by the NACA. The D-558-1 #1 is located at the National Naval Aviation Museum at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida. Following 27 flights by the Navy and Douglas the second D-558-1 aircraft was delivered to the NACA in November 1947. The D-558-1 #2 underwent extensive instrumentation by the NACA Muroc instrumentation section. The number 2 Skystreak made a total of 19 flights with the NACA before it crashed on takeoff due to compressor disintegration on May 3, 1948, killing NACA pilot Howard C. Lilly. The third D-558-I, BuNo 37972, aircraft was delivered to the NACA Muroc Flight Test Unit in 1949 after three Douglas test pilots and Howard Lilly had flown it. The number three aircraft took over the planned flight program of the D-558-1 #2. From the first flight in 1949 through 1953 the third Skystreak was flown in an intensive flight-research program by seven NACA test pilots, with a great deal of useful data collected on high-subsonic handling. The D-558-1 #3 made a total of 78 research flights with the NACA before being retired on June 10, 1953. The third Skystreak is on display at Carolinas Aviation Museum located at the Charlotte-Douglas International Airport (CLT) in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Skystreak reached Mach 0.99 in level flight, but only flew supersonic in a dive. In the public mind, much of the research performed by the D-558-1 Skystreaks was quickly overshadowed by Chuck Yeager and the supersonic Bell X-1 rocket plane. However, the Skystreak performed an important role in aeronautical research by flying for extended periods of time at transonic speeds, which freed the X-1 to fly for limited periods at supersonic speeds. =Aircraft Bureau Numbers (BuNo) and status= * D-558-1 Skystreak ** D-558-1 #1 - BuNo 37970 NACA-140, 101 flights (retired to National Naval Aviation Museum, NAS Pensacola, Florida) ** D-558-1 #2 - BuNo 37971 NACA-141, 46 flights (destroyed in crash, 3 May 1948) ** D-558-1 #3 - BuNo 37972 NACA-142, 81 flights (retired to Carolinas Aviation Museum, Charlotte-Douglas International Airport, Charlotte, North Carolina) ** D-558-1 #4, #5, #6 Additional aircraft originally ordered but later cancelled.

History Mitzpe Ramon in 1957 Mitzpe Ramon was founded in 1951 as a camp for the workers building Highway 40. The town's first permanent residents, several young families from Kibbutz Re'im and other parts of Israel began setting there in 1956. After five years, the town was home to 370 residents including 160 children, most of them veteran Israelis. There were also 180 housing units to absorb new immigrantshttp://jpress.org.il/Olive/APA/NLI_Heb/SharedView.Article.aspx?parm=JWg%2BxkVblgwkrxBOOQgWJpIn2SodyNClPUSG%2FcFX69q2nQiY4QpArrHmXA4cVYHqYw%3D%3D&mode;=image&href;=DAV%2f1961%2f06%2f16&page;=13&rtl;=true They were joined by immigrants from North Africa, Romania, and India in the 1960s, and it became the southernmost of the Negev's development towns. Conditions in the early years were harsh, with limited food supplies and practically no modern-day amenities. Ice blocks and provisions were delivered once a week by a supply truck. There was a single school with one classroom for all ages. The homes of the first settlers were prefabricated asbestos barracks. Later, rows of small attached stone houses were built and after that, apartment buildings, beginning in the early 1960s. In 1972, Mitzpe Ramon had a population of about 1,400 people living in 300 households. The town further grew after Ramon Airbase was completed in 1982. In 1988, the town had a population of about 3,000, and it experienced more significant population growth when it absorbed Soviet immigrants during the 1990s Post-Soviet aliyah.  Geology and climate  Ramon Crater, known as a makhtesh Ramon, is 38 km long, 6 km wide and 450 meters deep.Makhteshim Country, UNESCO Mitzpe Ramon's climate borders between hot desert climate and cold desert climate (K√∂ppen climate classification: BWh/BWk), characterized by hot, dry summers and cold winters. There are moderate to strong winds all year long, caused by its location above the crater, which make Mitzpe Ramon feel much colder than it really is. Precipitation is scarce, concentrated around the winter months, with an annual precipitation amount of roughly 70 millimeters (2.75 inches). Snowfall occurs on average once in a couple of years. Mitzpe Ramon street scene  Economy  The development of Mitzpe Ramon was adversely affected by the opening of Route 90 in the late 1960s. After the inauguration of this highway, traffic to and from Eilat bypassed Mitzpe Ramon almost entirely. However, growing interest in ecotourism, Jeep trekking (access to Nabatean ruins), mountain biking and hiking, stargazing and the upgrading of Route 40, which is considered a more scenic route to Eilat, have improved the economy. Jerusalem Marble, one of a few major suppliers and overseas exporters of Jerusalem stone (established in 1923), inaugurated a state-of-the-art factory in Mitzpe Ramon in January 2000.Supplying the world with Jerusalem stone Jerusalem Stone is exported globally. Mitzpe Ramon has six hotels and dozens of bed and breakfast establishments. In 2011, the Isrotel hotel chain opened a luxury hotel, the Beresheet Hotel, in Mitzpe Ramon. The Tourism Ministry allocated NIS 9.5 million for infrastructure development in Mitzpe Ramon, and the Ministry for the Development of the Negev and Galilee financed the construction of a landing strip for light aircraft.

It was a contemporary circus performance featuring acrobats, gymnasts, and other skilled performers. The show's creation was directed by Franco Dragone, who also directed many of Cirque du Soleil's earlier shows. Its title derives from the French phrase faire la nouba, meaning \\"to party\\" or \\"to live it up\\". History On December 23, 1998, the entertainment company Cirque du Soleil premiered a contemporary circus production, La Nouba, in a new theater custom-designed and built for Cirque du Soleil in Downtown Disney (later renamed Disney Springs) at the Walt Disney World Resort. With an international cast of 67 artists, the show welcomed more than 1,650 spectators ten times a week. The show was Cirque du Soleil's third resident (non-touring) show created after Myst√®re and O in Las Vegas. In 2007, 12 members of the power track act performed a routine during the pre-game show of Super Bowl XLI. La Nouba reached a major milestone on July 10, 2009, during its 9pm showing--this was their 5000th performance. On August 13, 2011, during the 6pm showing, the show celebrated its 6000th performance. The show's 7000th performance was celebrated on September 12, 2013, at the 6pm showing. La Nouba celebrated its 15th anniversary on December 18, 2013, with a special appearance from Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse. This was the first time any Disney characters had appeared in the show. La Nouba ended its 19-year run on December 31, 2017, to be replaced by a new Cirque du Soleil show. The new show, Drawn to Life, will open in 2020. Set and technical information The theater housing La Nouba was the first freestanding permanent structure built for Cirque du Soleil. The theater was designed by Michel Cr√™te, Michel Aub√© of Sc√©no Plus, Walt Disney Imagineering, and the architects of the Rockwell Group of New York. It could seat a total of 1,671 people per show. The building incorporated elements of fabric and tension reminiscent of the form of a circus tent. alt=A white illuminated building that resembles a circus tent The backdrop of the stage was a trellis measuring and made of PVC panels and scrim. The stage floor itself had five elevator lifts, each with a load capacity. These lifts could move at a rate of and rise to a maximum height of . The center stage lift, in addition to elevating, could also descend below the stage on a second axis. Other movable set elements included the two t√©l√©ph√©riques installed along the back wall which could transport acrobatic equipment, props, and scenery at a pace of . Four retractable power track floors were housed in the stage. Each floor weighed over and could move up to . The trampoline bed was tighter and used a second generation of springs, allowing the performers to jump higher and faster down the track, which measured in length. The trampolines consisted of two overlapping tracks, as seen in Alegr√≠a. The entire stage deck was layered with impact-resilient Mondo Sport Floor over wood in order to avoid injury. The theater's immense height (ground level to fly height was ; ground level to top of the masts was ) allowed the scenic and acrobatic equipment to be stored in the ceiling. As another first for Cirque du Soleil, the trapeze net was installed mechanically during the show with no visible stagehands as it was lowered into place from the ceiling. Characters In La Nouba there were two main character categories: the Cirques, or circus people, sporting bright, fluorescent colors; and the Urbains, or urbanites, who wore dark, muted colors or monochromatic costumes. As in every Cirque du Soleil show, in addition to the performances, there were several distinctive characters that participated in the show, sometimes as performers and sometimes as spectators. In La Nouba, these included: * L'Oiseau (The Green Bird): Out of her cage, this bird wants to fly, and is very marionettesque in her actions. * Les Cons (The Nuts): Dressed in all-white, these mischievous characters are the ever-present fools of the show. * Le Titan (The Titan): The show's resident \\"strong man\\" who confronts everyone on stage while contorting his body in unusual poses. * Le Promeneur (The Walker): Dressed in grey pinstripes with a small bowler hat, he sees the world through happiness. * Liama: A princess in the world of La Nouba who sings her joy and passion. * The Peacock Singer: A ambiguous character, dangerous and protective at the same time. He lives in height, perched at the top of the mountain, on the wall at the End of the World, where he sing the tale of all the action he see from the sky, like a bird. * The Pierrot Acrobat: Agile and nimble, he appears as a red acrobat. He is the adversary of the Titan until he joins him in mutual admiration at the end of the show. He is part of the Red Pierrot family, themselves part of a larger group of individuals known as Les Cirques. He appears up on the mountain, on the wall at the End of the World, on the Rocks, at the heart of the action. * Les Danseurs (The Dancers): The Romeo and Juliet of the show. One is a Lost Ballerina, who looking for a purpose to her existence. She will find love and join the Cirques. The second is the Pierrot Clown, a lost soul in the dark city, who will find a purpose and motivation to evolve through his love for the Lost Ballerina. * Clowns: ** Balto and Sergey (1998‚Äì2013): An unexpected clown duo directing people to their seats. Balthazar was originally created by Michel Deschamps in the 1970s and joined Cirque du Soleil's 1989-1990 American and European tours and Fascination in Japan in 1992. He also often made small appearances as Leonid Leykin's understudy during Alegr√≠a's 1997-1998 European tour. Sergei Shashalev also previously appeared in the latter. ** The Pablos (2014‚Äì2017): Former Alegr√≠a clowns who joined this show in 2014. * The Prince: A noble prince transformed into a frog. * The Rag Doll: A rag doll left in the attic that will fly away for a while with The Walker through the door of her imagination. * Virginia, the Cleaning Lady: Also referred to as \\"La Femme de M√©nage\\", she is shocked to be in this world and astonished by what goes on around her. She sweeps and dusts nonetheless until her dream becomes a reality. Acts The show contained the following acts: * Breakdancing: Josh Ortiz (\\"The Incredible Josh\\"), Jean Carlos Lloret (\\"Bebo\\"), and Dmytro Li (\\"Flying Buddha\\") performed routines that straddled the line between dance and acrobatics, with spins, flips and other tricks. * Aerial bamboo: Alexander and Ekaterina Abramov did a variety of tricks while hanging from a pole-shaped apparatus suspended from the ceiling. This act originated in China using bamboo poles, hence its name. * Diabolos: A children's toy with a circus twist, four young and very talented girls threw hourglass-shaped, giant yoyos in the air with help of a long line of string connected to two sticks that they held in each hand. The children flipped, rolled and even skipped with the string while the spinning diabolo plummeted to the stage to be caught at the last second. Up to two diabolos were manipulated by each performer in this game of dexterity. * Cycles: Included one BMX cyclist and a mountain biker performing tricks on bicycles. * Aerial cradle: The aerial cradle looked like a door and was the setting for a demonstration of equal-opportunity strength and agility. This display featured elements of traditional circus aerial cradle, but added a unique twist: the male and female artists took turns supporting one another, above the stage. * Aerial ballet in silk: A solo male performer dangled above the stage using incredible strength to create multiple poses, while four female artists wrapped themselves in the long column of silk and then unwraped themselves by spinning and flipping in this sky high ballet. This was the most dangerous act in La Nouba as it used no wires or support, only the artists' concentration. * Rola bola: A colorful performer built a tower of cylinders and pipes, all the while balancing on a board on top of it all. As his tower grew higher and higher, so did the risk and excitement; the acrobat juggled while on top of the shaky tower. * Flying trapeze: Four pendulum-like swings, on two different levels, carried a team of perfectly synchronized aerialists above the stage. * Power track and trampoline: This high-energy spectacle had performers literally bouncing off the walls and through the windows and roof of a three-dimensional building. This seven-and- a-half minute act included athletes performing 394 flips and 62 twists. =Acts in rotation= * Cyr wheel: This act was a backup act for aerial bamboo and was not commonly performed in the show. =Retired acts= * Balancing on chairs: Featured a solo performer who hand-balanced on eight chairs stacked on a table. The chair stack rose in the air. The area below the chairs and table rose via a platform raising the performer a full above the stage. This act was originally created and performed by Vasily Demenchukov, who had previously performed a similar act in the Nouvelle Exp√©rience. The act was then taken over by Rokardy Rodriguez in 2002, who kept performing until the entire act was replaced with Anthony Gatto's juggling act in 2010. * German wheel: Featured two performers inside of large double-hoops, manipulated by shifting their center of gravity. The performers would roll around obstacles, fall over spinning until they were almost flat on the ground then stand back up, and perform tricks with both performers in one wheel. This act was replaced by the jump rope act in 2010. * Juggling: Anthony Gatto juggled clubs, rings and balls. This act was replaced by the rola bola act in 2014. * Jump rope: A rebooted version of the young children's game, two expert skipping soloists were the centre of attention in this speedy act. In 2015, this act made way for the B-boys. * High wire: The entire act took place on a -long high wire. Wire walkers ascended to a height of above the stage, supported by a half-inch steel wire. This act was replaced by the aerial bamboo act in 2015.  Costumes  Costume designer Dominique Lemieux created thirty different costume concepts and drew up at least ten different designs for each concept. Lemieux mixed historical and traditional circus ideas with contemporary fashions in her designs, and ten special technicians were employed in order to custom dye fabrics, real and synthetic hair, feathers, horsehair, and leather materials used on the various costumes. In the eight weeks she was given to design the costumes (October 24 to December 23, 1998), she created two drastically different styles to separate the urban people from the circus people. The circus people donned bright, neon colors while the urbanites were represented by black, gray, and muted tones. Lemieux used natural, textured fabrics such as hemp to epitomize the urbanites. Many of the performers underwent a metamorphosis indicated by often dramatic costume changes; for instance, the urbanites' outfits began in dark, muted blues, reds, and greens and ended in white, fairy-like outfits. In the German wheel costumes, Lemieux accented dark colors with fluorescent fabrics to provide a high contrast with the black lights used during this act. The performers were designed to appear as marionettes and to emphasize human anatomy. The costumes designed for the flying trapeze act were tribal and androgynous. They were elaborated with complex collars, head ornaments and tutu skirts for the males. Les Cons were inspired by the Pierrot, with simple, white outfits to depict their innocence. For all Cirque du Soleil productions, plaster head molds were created to make certain that all wigs, masks, and headpieces fit perfectly. Four different wig designs were created for the show and each wig took one person approximately seventy hours to complete. Music The music of La Nouba, composed by Beno√Æt Jutras, was performed live by six musicians and two singers. A CD album of the music of La Nouba was originally released in 1999 and re-released in 2005. It features most of the music played during the show.

Biography Schirmer was born in Berlin. As a youth Schirmer painted flowers in the royal porcelain factory; afterwards he became a pupil of Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow in the Berlin Academy, but his art owed most to Italy. In 1827 he went to Italy, where his sojourn extended over three years. He became a disciple of his countryman Joseph Koch, who built historic landscape on the Poussins, and is said to have caught inspiration from J. M. W. Turner. In 1831 Schirmer established himself in Berlin in a studio with scholars. From 1839 to 1865 he was professor of landscape in the academy. Schirmer's place in the history of art is distinctive. His sketches in Italy were more than transcripts of the spots; he studied nature with the purpose of composing historic and poetic landscapes. On the completion of the Berlin Museum of Antiquities came his opportunity. Upon the walls he painted classic sites and temples, and elucidated the collections by the landscape scenery with which they were historically associated. Schirmer's goal was to make his art the poetic interpretation of nature and he deemed technique secondary to conception. His pictures appeal to the mind by the ideas they embody, by beauty of form, harmony of line, significance of light and color. In this constructional landscape German critics discover motive, inner meaning, the subjective, the ideal.

It operates at 936 kHz, with a transmitter output power of 50 kW. The new transmitter at Bremen-Oberneuland was built in 1999 as a replacement for the old transmission facility of Radio Bremen at Leher Feld, which was demolished to make room for an industrial area. Today the mediumwave transmitter Bremen is the only transmitter owned by Radio Bremen -- all other transmitters now used by Radio Bremen are the property of Deutsche Telekom -- uses a cage aerial, mounted on a 45-metre (146 feet) high, grounded, guyed lattice steel mast. This aerial has a high gain of 4.5 dB, which means that the 50 kW transmitter feeding it produces the same effect as a 140 kW transmitter feeding an antenna with a gain of 1 dB. The broadcasts from this transmitter reach all northern Germany during daylight, except the most eastern areas. At night it covers all of Europe, although a transmitter operating at the same frequency in Lviv, Ukraine often interferes with it. In 2006 the aerial mast got a new coat of paint. Due to financial difficulties, Radio Bremen switched off the transmitter in March 2010 \\"temporarily\\" and dismantled it after only 200 people voiced their protest.

M√ºller held several positions in the Habsburg Monarchy administration of mines and coinage in the Banat, Transylvania, and Tyrol. During his time in Transylvania he discovered tellurium in 1782. In his later career he became a member of the imperial council in Vienna and was knighted and elevated to the rank Freiherr in 1820. Place and date of birth M√ºller was born in 1740 or 1742 in the Habsburg Empire. While the Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie gives 1 July 1740 and Vienna as date and place of birth, the Neue Deutsche Biographie prefers 4 October 1742 and the small town of Poysdorf in Lower Austria. The much older works Neuer Nekrolog der Deutschen and Oesterreichische National-Encyklop√§die do not give a place of birth and only the year 1740 for his birth. Even articles by Mary Elvira Weeks on the discovery of tellurium, published in the Journal of Chemical Education in 1932, and 1935 quote two different locations of his birth: one in Vienna, Archduchy of Austria and the other Hermannstadt, Principality of Transylvania (present-day Sibiu, Romania). A newer biography on the topic makes clear that date and place of birth are not definitely known. Education and career He studied philosophy and law in Vienna. After finishing his studies he started further studies at the Bergakademie (Mining Academy) in Schemnitz (Selmecb√°nya), Lower Hungary (today Bansk√° ≈†tiavnica, Slovakia) in 1763. He studied mining, mechanics, mineralogy and chemistry and after graduating he became a Markscheider (official mine surveyor) in 1768. In 1770 he joined the Hofcommission f√ºr die Regulierung der Banater Berg und H√ºttenwerke (royal commission for mining in the Banat) where he gained a lot of knowledge on mining in the Banat. He was promoted to the rank of an Oberbergmeister (senior mining official) and became a mine manager in the same year. In 1775 he became Oberbergmeister in the Tyrol town of Schwaz. Schwaz was one of the largest centres of silver and copper mining in Austria-Hungary in that time. In 1778 he discovered an occurrence of tourmaline in the Zillertal. M√ºller became one of seven Thesaurariats councillor in Transylvania responsible for the supervision of all mining and coinage activities in Transylvania in 1778. After the dissolution of the Thesaurariat M√ºller became Oberinspector (chief surveyor) of all mining, smelting and salt production in Transylvania. =Discovery of tellurium= M√ºller as the Austrian chief surveyor of mines in Transylvania was responsible for the analysis of ore samples. He analyzed gold ore from Kleinschlatten (today Zlatna, Romania). This ore was known as \\"Faczebajer wei√ües bl√§ttriges Golderz\\" (white leafy gold ore from Faczebaja) or antimonalischer Goldkies (antimonic gold pyrite), and, according to Anton von Rupprecht, was Spie√üglask√∂nig (argent molybdique), containing native antimony.'v. Born, Abh. Privatges. v. B√∂hmen 5 (1782), 383. M√ºller concluded that the ore did not contain antimony, but that it was bismuth sulfide.M√ºller, F.J. √úber den vermeintlichen nat√ºrlichen Spiessglask√∂nig. Physikalische Arbeiten der eintr√§chtigen Freunde in Wien 1, 1 (1783), 57‚Äì59. The following year, he reported that this was erroneous and that the ore contained mostly gold and an unknown metal very similar to antimony. After a thorough investigation which lasted for three years and consisted of more than fifty tests, M√ºller determined the specific gravity of the mineral and noted the radish-like odor of the white smoke which passed off when the new metal was heated, the red color which the metal imparts to sulfuric acid, and the black precipitate which this solution gives when diluted with water. Nevertheless, he was not able to identify this metal and gave it the names and tlbermetallum problematicum}}, as it did not show the properties predicted for the expected antimony. In 1798, the German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth isolated the new element from a sample sent by M√ºller. After a thorough examination of the material he concluded that a new metal was present in the sample. He called it tellurium, but gave the credit of the discovery to M√ºller. =Later life= In 1788 he was once more promoted and as Gubernialrath he held a powerful position in the administration of Transylvania. M√ºller was knighted by Leopold II to the lowest title of nobility, Edler, in the same year. From that point on he carried the name Franz-Joseph M√ºller Edler von Reichenstein. He was elected as a member of the Berlin Society of Friends of Natural Science. In 1798 M√ºller became court counsellor and was appointed to the court in Vienna, where he was part of the imperial council. In 1818 M√ºller retired from his duties but held his position in the council until his death. He became Knight of the Order of Saint Stephen of Hungary in 1818 and became a noble by receiving the title of a Freiherr in 1820. Both honours were granted by the Emperor Franz I (II). M√ºller died in his 80s in 1825 or 1826 in Vienna.

She was an eyewitness to events detailed in her memoirs, Journal of my life during the French Revolution (Ma Vie sous la R√©volution) published posthumously in 1859. She was mistress to the Duke of Orl√©ans and to the future George IV, by whom she is said to have borne an illegitimate daughter. Elliott trafficked correspondence and hid French aristocrats escaping from the French Revolution. She was arrested several times but managed to avoid the guillotine, and was released after the death of Robespierre. Early life Elliott was born probably in Edinburgh about 1754, the youngest daughter of Grissel Brown (died 30 September 1767) (Major & Murden 2016) and Hew Dalrymple (died 1774), an Edinburgh advocate concerned in the great Douglas case. Her parents separated around the time of her birth, and she was most likely brought up at her grandparents house. She was educated in a French convent, and on her return to Scotland, was introduced by her father into Edinburgh society. Her beauty made such an impression on John Elliott, a prominent and wealthy physician, that he made her an offer of marriage in 1771. She accepted, although Elliott was about 18 years her senior. They were married on 19 October 1771 in London, when she was 17. The couple entered fashionable society, but eventually grew apart due to their difference in age and interests. In 1774 Elliott met and fell in love with Lord Valentia, with whom she entered into an affair. Convinced of his wife's infidelity, John Elliott had the couple followed and eventually sued Valentia for criminal conversation (adultery). He received ¬£12,000 in damages before successfully obtaining a divorce. With her social reputation destroyed, Elliott became recognised as a member of the demimonde and forced to earn her living as a professional mistress or courtesan. She was then taken by her brother to a French convent, but she seems to have been brought back almost immediately by Lord Cholmondeley, who became her lover and remained one of her principal protectors throughout her life. Life in England Having met Lord Cholmondeley at the Pantheon in 1776, she began a liaison with him that lasted for three years. Their friends included the courtesans Gertrude Mahon and Kitty Frederick. Thomas Gainsborough painted two portraits of her in 1778, which are in the Frick Collection and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In 1782, she had a short, concealed intrigue with the Prince of Wales (afterwards George IV) and gave birth to a daughter on 30 March 1782, who was baptised at St Marylebone as Georgiana Augusta Frederica Seymour (d. 1813) but used the name Georgina Seymour. Elliott declared that the Prince was the father of her child and The Morning Post stated in January 1782 that he admitted responsibility. However, the child was dark in complexion, and when she was first shown to the Prince, he is said to have remarked, \\"To convince me that this is my girl they must first prove that black is white.\\" The Prince and many others regarded Lord Cholmondeley as the father of the girl, although the Prince's friends said that Charles William Wyndham (brother of Lord Egremont), whom she was thought to resemble, claimed paternity. Yet others thought she might have been fathered by George Selwyn. Lord Cholmondeley brought up the girl, and after her early death in 1813, looked after her only child. Life in France: French Revolution Grace Elliott (1754?‚Äì1823). Portrait by Thomas Gainsborough, 1778. (In the Metropolitan Museum of Art) George, Prince of Wales, introduced her to the French Duke of Orleans in 1784 and by 1786, she had permanently set up residence in Paris and become one of Orleans' recognised mistresses. In exchange for her companionship, the Duke granted her a home on the Rue Miromesnil and a property in Meudon, to the south of Paris. During this period Elliott also pursued liaisons with the Duke de Fitz-James and the Prince of Conde. Much of what is known about Elliot's life in France is recorded in her memoirs, Journal of my life during the French Revolution. Although there are a number of inconsistencies in her account, her work has become one of the best- known English-language accounts of The Terror, documenting the movements of the Duke of Orleans and those within his aristocratic Jacobin circle at the Palais-Royal. During her life in Paris, Elliott witnessed the horror of the September massacres and the body of the Princess de Lamballe carried through the streets. Although Elliott was an associate of the Duke of Orleans (who later took the name Philippe √âgalit√©), her royalist sympathies soon became widely known throughout her district, and her home was frequently searched. It has been recently shown that Elliott was trafficking correspondence on behalf of the British government and assisting in the transportation of messages between Paris and members of the exiled French court in Coblenz and in Belgium. Elliott several times risked her life to assist and hide aristocrats pursued by the Revolutionary government. Shortly after the Assault on the Tuileries Palace, on 10 August 1792, Elliott hid the injured Marquis de Champcentz by physically carrying him to her house on the Rue Miromesnil at great risk. During a search of her home, she placed him between the mattresses of her bed and feigned illness. On another occasion, Elliott agreed to take in and hide at her home in Meudon Madame de Perigord and her two children, who were attempting to flee to England. She helped to arrange false travel documents for several people wishing to escape the Revolution. After hiding Champcentz in the attic of her home in Meudon, she managed to fix his passage out of France. In the spring of 1793, however, she was arrested and imprisoned and spent the rest of the Terror in prisons, including the Recollets and the Carmes, where she claims to have met Jos√©phine de Beauharnais, although this has been questioned by historians. Her writings detail her harrowing prison experiences, the violent coercion she experienced, and the illness and deprivation endured by her fellow prisoners. Later life Although many of her friends met their deaths, including Madame du Barry, Elliott did not. She narrowly avoided death and was released after the Reign of Terror came to an end, not before she had been confined in a total to four different prisons by the Republican government. In later years, there were rumours that she had an attachment with Napoleon Bonaparte, but had rejected his offer of marriage. She died a wealthy woman at Ville d'Avray, in present-day Hauts-de-Seine, in May 1823, while a lodger with the commune's mayor. She was buried in P√®re Lachaise Cemetery. Works * Depictions in film and literature A dramatic portrayal of part of her life is contained in Eric Rohmer's 2001 film The Lady and the Duke.

Mason believes that Nazis cannot take power as long as the existing U.S. government remains in place. He advocates murder and violence to create chaos and anarchy and destabilize the system. Mason considers Timothy McVeigh and James Fields Jr. to be \\"heroes\\" and claims that the white race is in danger because of the Jews. He expressed that the election of Donald Trump has given him hope, commenting that \\"in order to Make America Great Again, you have to make it white again\\". Mason is an advisor to Atomwaffen Division, a paramilitary neo- Nazi terrorist organization, which has been identified as part of the alt- right. Atomwaffen was responsible for 8 homicides in 2017‚Äì2019. During a court case related to Atomwaffen, the prosecutor stated that Mason \\"may well represent the most violent, revolutionary and potentially terroristic expression of right-wing extremism current today.\\" He lives in a swastika- bedecked U.S. Government-funded apartment in Denver. Life and career Mason grew up in Chillicothe, Ohio. In 1966, when he was 14 years old, he joined the youth movement of George Lincoln Rockwell's American Nazi Party (ANP). In 1968, when he was 16, Mason planned to murder the principal and other staff members at his high school. Instead, following the advice of William Luther Pierce, he quit school and began working at the American Nazi Party's headquarters in Virginia. After the death of George Lincoln Rockwell in 1967, Mason aligned himself with the National Socialist White People's Party and Joseph Tommasi's National Socialist Liberation Front (NSLF). In 1970, at the age of 18, Mason became a full-fledged member of the National Socialist White People's Party (NSWPP) and returned to Chillicothe. In 1980, Mason took over writing Siege, the newsletter of the NSLF. He continued publishing until 1986. In the newsletter, Mason paid tribute to Adolf Hitler, Joseph Tommasi, Charles Manson, and Savitri Devi. He also advocated random attacks and murders in order to destabilize society. In 1992, the newsletters were edited and published in book form as Siege: The Collected Writings of James Mason by Michael Jenkins Moynihan. The book acquired a neo-Nazi following and is now required reading for initiates of the Atomwaffen Division. In 1973, Mason and fellow neo-Nazi Greg Hurles went to a car dealership in order to test drive a car. They then maced several black teenagers in the parking lot of a Dairy Queen. Mason served six months in a Cincinnati workhouse. Between 1978 and 1980, Mason worked with the National Socialist White Worker's Party and edited The Stormer, their newsletter. In the early 1980s, Mason began corresponding with Sandra Good and Lynette Fromme, two followers of Charles Manson. In 1982, along with Manson, Mason founded Universal Order, an organization that encouraged terror with notoriety, similar to that achieved by the Manson Family. In 1988 and 1991, police raided Mason's home in Ohio and seized pornographic photos of a 15-year-old girl. In 1992, he pleaded guilty to two counts of \\"illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material.\\" In 1993, Mason moved to Colorado. In May 1994, Mason was arrested and charged with two counts of sexual exploitation of a minor and two counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Mason threatened his ex-girlfriend, who was then 16 years old, and a Latino man who she had been dating, with a firearm. Mason struck a plea bargain and was convicted of weapons charges. He was in and out of prison for years, and was released in August 1999. In 2000, he published The Theocrat, a comparison of Bible passages and passages in Hitler's Mein Kampf. In November 2019, it was reported by local media that Mason was living in government-subsidized housing in Denver and eating at local soup kitchens. On March 14, 2020, Mason claimed that the Atomwaffen Division has disbanded. However, the group is believed to be on the cusp of being designated Foreign Terrorist Organization by the State Department, and Anti-Defamation League concluded \\"the move is designed to give members breathing room rather than actually end their militant activities\\". According to SITE Intelligence Group Atomwaffen and its offshoots remain clandestinely active.

He was born of a noble family, probably at Hollern near Lohhof halfway between Munich and Freising.  Travels Schiltberger joined the suite of Lienhart Richartinger in 1394, and he then went to fight under Sigismund, King of Hungary (afterwards emperor), against the Ottoman Empire on the Hungarian frontier. At the Battle of Nicopolis on 28 September 1396, he was wounded and taken prisoner; when Schiltberger had recovered the use of his feet, Sultan Bayezid I (Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m) took him into his service as a runner (1396‚Äì1402). During this time he seems to have accompanied Ottoman troops to certain parts of Asia Minor and to Egypt. On Bayezid's overthrow at the Battle of Ankara (20 July 1402), Schiltberger passed into the service of Bayezid's conqueror Timur: he now appears to have followed Timur to Samarkand, Azerbaijan and Georgia.Johann Schiltberger. Bondage and Travels of Johann Schiltberger. Translated by J. Buchan Telfer. Ayer Publishing, 1966, p. 86. . After Timur's death (17 February 1405) his German runner first became a slave of Shah Rukh, the ablest of Timur's sons; then of Miran Shah, a brother of Shah Rukh; then of Abu Bekr, a son of Miran Shah, whose camp roamed up and down Azerbaijan. Schiltberger next accompanied Chekre, a Tatar prince living in Abu Bekr's horde, on an excursion to Siberia, of which name Schiltberger gives us the first clear mention in west European literature. He also probably followed his new master in his attack on the Old Bulgaria of the middle Volga, answering to the modern Kazan and its neighborhood. Wanderings in the steppe lands of south-east Russia; visits to Sarai, the old capital of the Kipchak Khanate on the lower Volga and to Azov or Tana, still a trading centre for Venetian and Genoese merchants; a fresh change of servitude on Chekre's ruin; travels in the Crimea, Circassia, Abkhazia and Mingrelia; and finally escape (from the neighborhood of Batum) followed. Arriving at Constantinople, Schiltberger stayed in hiding there for a time; he then returned to his Bavarian home (1427) by way of Kilia, Akkerman, Lemberg, Krak√≥w, Breslau and Meissen. After his return he became a chamberlain of Duke Albert III, probably receiving this appointment in the first instance before the duke's accession in 1438. It is assumed that he died around 1440.  Writings  Schiltberger's Reisebuch contains not only a record of his own experiences and a sketch of various chapters of contemporary Eastern history, but also an account of countries and their manners and customs, especially of those countries which he had himself visited. First come the lands \\"this side\\" of the Danube, where he had travelled; next follow those between the Danube and the sea, which had now fallen under the Turk; after this, the Ottoman dominions in Asia; last come the more distant regions of Schiltberger's world, from Trebizond to Russia and from Egypt to India. In this regional geography the descriptions of Brusa; of various west Caucasian and Armenian regions; of the regions around the Caspian, and the habits of their peoples (especially the Red Tatars); of Siberia; of the Crimea with its great Genoese colony at Kaffa (where he once spent five months); and of Egypt and Arabia, are particularly worth notice. His allusions to the Catholic missions still persisting in Armenia and in other regions beyond the Euxine, and to (non-Roman ?) Christian communities even in the Great Tatary of the steppes are also remarkable. Schiltberger is perhaps the first writer of Western Christendom to give the true burial place of Muhammad at Medina: his sketches of Islam and of Eastern Christendom, with all their shortcomings, are of remarkable merit for their time: and he may fairly be reckoned among the authors who contributed to fix Prester John, at the close of the Middle Ages, in Abyssinia. Schiltberger also recorded one of the first European sightings of Przewalski horses. (Manuscript in the Munich Municipal Library, Sign. 1603, Bl. 210). His work, however, contains many inaccuracies; thus in reckoning the years of his service both with Bayezid and with Timur he is off unaccountably in multiples of two. His account of Timur and his campaigns is misty, often incorrect, and sometimes fabulous: nor can von Hammer's parallel between Marco Polo and Schiltberger be sustained without large reservations. Four manuscripts of the Reisebuch exist: (i) at Donaueschingen in the F√ºrstenberg Library, No. 481; (2) at Heidelberg, University Library, 216; (3) at Nuremberg, City Library, 34; (4) at St Gall, Monast.

Nettie's corpse remains in bed throughout the reception, while various attendees visit her room without realizing she's dead. By the time bossy daughter Toni finds out and plans a dramatic announcement, other family members are mostly unsurprised or not even too upset. The Brenners are a nouveau riche family from Louisville, Kentucky, where Muffin's father, \\"Snooks\\", made millions in the trucking industry. The Corellis are an old money North Shore Chicago family. Due to rumors that Luigi has mob connections, virtually every invitee sent regrets. Only one guest (other than family members) attends. Nevertheless, Rita is determined to run the reception by the book, setting up a receiving line for the one guest and asking family members and staff to go down the line so it will not look empty. A series of disasters unfolds, including the display of an embarrassing nude portrait of the bride; caterer Ingrid Hellstrom becoming ill, then getting high and causing a disturbance after Meecham gives her a pill; and a tornado when the cake is to be cut, forcing everyone to find shelter in the cellar. Two guests arrive late: the groom and bride's disgruntled exes, Tracy Farrell and Wilson Briggs, who bond over their mutual anger. Unsavory family drama unfolds. Regina is a drug addict. Her marriage was arranged by Nettie after Luigi met Regina while working as a waiter in Italy. Luigi was forced to change his name and be estranged from his Italian family for 22 years. His Italian-speaking brother unexpectedly shows up, and when Meecham reminds Luigi that Nettie is dead and can no longer impose the marriage conditions, Luigi is thrilled to see his long-lost brother. Regina's sister Clarice has a romance with her African-American butler, Randolph; her other sister, Toni, is married to Mack Goddard, who falls in love at first sight with Tulip Brenner, mother of the bride, and tries to woo her. Snooks has a borderline incestuous attachment to his nearly mute daughter Buffy, the maid of honor, who speaks at the reception only once, to tell Dino she is pregnant and he is the father. Not wanting to be upstaged by the bride, Buffy disrobes in front of Muffin's nude portrait. Dino confides to Wilson about Buffy's pregnancy; Wilson tells Tracy, who vindictively spreads the news. Snooks confronts Dino, who admits to sleeping with Buffy but says she also slept with nearly every member of his military- school barracks. Snooks' sister Marge Spar from New Jersey starts romancing the Corellis' gardener, while bridesmaid Rosie Bean is unaware her shy friend Shelby Munker is having an affair with Rosie's husband Russell. Muffin and Dino prepare to leave for their honeymoon in a new car, the Corellis' wedding gift. Muffin is rattled when Rita makes an unexpected pass at her. She then finds Dino in the shower with his groomsman, Reedley Roots, seemingly engaged in a gay sexual encounter. The newlyweds' car is seen driving away and the families assume Dino and Muffin left without saying goodbye. Snooks drives his family back to their hotel. They see Dino's car wrecked and in flames, and rush back to the mansion to share the awful news. The families are grieving when Muffin and Dino appear from upstairs, having never left because of Dino's passing out drunk; Tracy and Wilson, out for revenge, swiped the car and died in the crash. Tulip declares the incident was God punishing her for sinful thoughts of having an affair with Mack. Luigi pays his respects to Nettie. He tells her corpse he kept his bargain for 22 years, and no one there knows who he really is. Now he will take his leave. He finds his brother in the bushes, making love with Buffy. Luigi and his brother happily drive away as a half- dressed Buffy waves goodbye.

Production The film was inspired by a remark Altman made while doing publicity for his previous film, 3 Women. Upon being asked what his next movie would be, Altman jokingly replied that he was going to shoot a wedding next. Later, Altman and his production assistant decided to follow through on the idea and began planning the film.Ebert, Roger. Awake in the Dark: The Best of Roger Ebert.

It is initiated by an individual who claims to have a greater right to their immediate possession than the current possessor. For an action in detinue to succeed, a claimant must first prove that he had better right to possession of the chattel than the defendant and second that the defendant refused to return the chattel once demanded by the claimant. Detinue allows for a remedy of damages for the value of the chattel, but unlike most other interference torts, detinue also allows for the recovery of the specific chattel being withheld.W.S. Holdsworth, A History of English Law 324-27  History  Historically, detinue came in two forms: \\"detinue sur bailment\\" and \\"detinue sur trover\\". In detinue sur bailment, the defendant is in a bailment relationship with the claimant and either refuses to return the chattel or else has negligently or intentionally lost or destroyed it. The onus is on the bailee to prove that the loss of the chattel was not his or her fault. In detinue sur trover, the defendant can be any individual in possession of the chattel who refuses to return it to the claimant. A defendant could be a finder or a thief or any innocent third party, and the claimant need only have a better right to possession. Early writs and forms of action were exceptionally narrow in scope. This is reflective of the basic conservatism of the Common Law courts in the middle and late medieval period. This was in contrast with the Courts of Equity which were creative in producing novel writs for many new fact situations. Compensation in those days was usually not in money, which was rare, but in land, livestock, or furnishings, as these were the typical measures of wealth. What the plaintiff wanted back was the land, cattle or even coins lent. Maitland suggests that in the earliest time the writ of debt seems almost to have been designed to recover identical coins.Kiralfy, A. K. R., \\"Potter's Historical Introduction to English Law and Its Institutions, Fourth Edition\\", Sweet & Maxwell Limited, 1962 The early writ of detinue was specifically designed for recovery of a chattel wrongfully detained, but not an action to recover loss due to a chattel being harmed while the defendant had it. Two facts marked the early common law actions. They were defective because of the wide field which was excluded. They were also defective because the plaintiff might well think himself entitled to a remedy, but by reason of the procedure find that he went away empty. The defendant to a writ of debt or detinue might bring others with him who would swear that his denial of the claim was true. This was technically called his \\"wage of law\\" or \\"wager of law\\". It was enough to dispose of the plaintiff's claim. A common way to escape all writs, even the writ of right, as well as debt and detinue was to claim sickness. If the jury found him in bed with his boots off, the custom was to delay the writ for a year and a day. Relation to replevin One of the oldest actions in the royal courts was replevin which had its roots in the law of customary courts. Strictly speaking, replevin in its original form was a provisional remedy. Its provision was to procure for the plaintiff the return of chattels taken out of his possession until the right to their possession could be decided by a court of law. No doubt, it was designed to avoid quarrels likely to cause a breach of the peace pending a settlement of the dispute about the right to possession. In other words, the rule of law was beginning to replace that of local force of arms and personal conflict as the resolution of disputes over chattels. The action was in direct succession to the efforts made to regulate self-help, which were the origin of the law of tort. The form of legal recourse was in connection of distress (distractio). This was the practice of taking some chattel from the peasant or underling until some action was performed. In the medieval era the services for which distress could be levied were numerous, since the incidents of tenure were then very numerous. Distress was also leviable as damage feasant. When animals strayed and did damage to a neighbor, they could be retained until the damage was made good. Whether or not the distress was levied for rent or for livestock damage feasant, the owner of the animals could obtain their release by giving \\"gage and pledge\\" - a form of security that the damage would be made good. One peculiarity of distraint lay in the fact that the distrainor did not get any form of legal possession. The goods and chattels were considered to be in the custody of the law. As a result, there was no taking of possession by the distrainor that was unlawful, since no possession was technically inferred.Enever, \\"History of the Law of Distress\\". The action in replevin began to appear in the thirteenth century. It seems clear that originally the action of replevin lay simply where the question to be determined was that of wrongful distress. Excess and abuse of distress was punished.Year Book 32 Edward IYear Book 33 Edward I p. 5452 Henry III (1267), cc. 1,2,3,4 The mere claim by the distrainor that he had a right to the chattels distrained was a technicality that ended the action in replevin. It was then necessary to re-file using a new writ invented in the early fourteenth century, called the writ de proprietate probanda - a writ \\"concerning the proof of ownership.\\" H. E. L., III p. 284, n.7; S. S., p. 197.  Alternatives to replevin Since the distrainor did not get possession he was not originally liable in trespass, and the spheres of the two forms of action remained distinct. During the fourteenth century, after some vacillation by judges, it was held that the plaintiff could elect which remedy he chose when the chattels had been distrained.Year Book 7 Henry IV, M., pl. 5 at f. 29 It was also held that replevin could be used in place of the writ of trespass de bonis aspotatis (trespass by the asportation of goods). In reality, there is little evidence this substitution ever occurred with any frequency, if at all.Ames, Lectt., p. 183, n. 2. The rule involved interference with the possession of a chattel by the rightful owner. The 1856 case of Mennie v. Blake Mennie v. Blake, 6 E. & B. 842 gives what Potter calls an admirable survey of the law of replevin. There it was stated: \\"It seems clear that replevin is not maintainable unless in a case in which there has been first a taking out of the possession of the owner. This stands upon authority and the reason of the thing.\\" In the Law of Torts, John Fleming wrote: \\"From medieval times, there has also come down to us a summary process, known as replevin, by which a man out of whose possession goods have been taken may obtain their return until the right to the goods can be determined by a court of law. Replevin arose out of the need of a turbulent society to discourage resort to self help and although for a long time primarily used in disputes about distress between landlord and tenant, it was gradually expanded to cover all cases of allegedly wrongful dispossession. If the plaintiff wanted return of his chattel in specie, replevin was a more appropriate remedy than either trespass or trover in which only damages could be recovered. Restoration of the property is, of course, only provisional, pending determination of title.\\" Fleming, John, \\"The Law of Torts, Fourth Edition\\" Australia, The Law Book Company, 1971 It depended upon an original unlawful taking by the way of distraint. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the action of trover largely replaced trespass for wrongful distress. Replevin and trover never completely coincided, because there was a limitation on replevin. Replevin remains the modern action, albeit defined by statute, for recovery of chattels pending a decision of the right of possession. It lies only where the possession was taken from the plaintiff, whether under colour of legal process or otherwise, by an act having the nature of a trespass. Canadian cases distinguishing replevin from detinue  Manitoba Agricultural Credit Corp. V. Heaman,Manitoba Agricultural Credit Corp. v. Heaman, 70 DLR 4th 518, (1990) a 1990 Canadian case, the Manitoba Court of Appeal adopted the words of the 1875 Manitoba Administration of Justice Act as having \\"codified, but not changed, at least in substance the action of replevin by saying, \\"Whenever any goods, chattels, bonds, debentures, promissory notes, bills of exchange, books of account, papers, writings, valuable securities or other personal property or effects have been wrongfully distrained under circumstances in which by the law of England replevin might be made, the person so complaining of such distress as unlawful, may obtain a writ of replevin in the manner prescribed by this Act\\" In the 1899 case McGregor v. McGregor,McGregor v. McGregor 6 BCR 432 (1899) British Columbia Supreme Court justice Irving wrote: \\"An action of replevin may be brought (1) where goods have been wrongfully distrained or (2) where goods have been otherwise, i.e. otherwise than by distress, wrongfully taken or detained. The word 'wrongfully' is applicable to both cases. 'Wrongfully'...imports the infringement of some right, and any invasion of the civil rights of another is in itself a legal wrong, and the appropriate action for the violation of the legal right unconnected with contract is an action for tort. The early history of replevin action in England is traced (as)...'The nature of the complaint in the action was for a tortious taking of the goods. Our British Columbia replevin action, which is wider than the English, gives the right to replevy to the party who could maintain trespass or trover. It is given, as it were, supplementary to, or in aid of, the remedy which those actions afford; but as all three actions, trespass, trover and replevin are classed...as actions of tort, I think the action under our British Columbia statute is for the tortious taking or tortious detention of goods.\\" Medieval detinue Detinue was an old form of action which slowly branched off from the action of debt.P. & M., II, p. 173, ibid.. The action lay for the unlawful detention of ascertained chattels at the instance of a person who was entitled to have possession. The writ was a command to the defendant that he should deliver up to the plaintiff the chattels quae ei injuste detinet - \\"which he unlawfully withholds from him.\\" The gist of the action was the unlawful detention by the defendant. An example is seen when a borrower might be sued for unlawfully refusing to return a borrowed article.Year Book 20 & 21, Edward I ( R. S.), p. 192 Bracton described an early case of detinue where three pigs were unlawfully detained from a woman. Ames regarded the action of detinue as essentially an action based upon contract, having its foundation in bailment.Lectt., pp. 70-79, and pp. 82-83Holmes, \\"Common Law\\", p. 169;P. & M., II, pp. 174, 175 Ames' point is that the action was a means of enforcing an agreement which was recognized by the law. This argument represents the realization of a theory of contract in detinue. Detinue also replaced the more ancient action of res adiratae. According to Bracton the plaintiff could drop the words felony and merely claim that his chattels were in the possession of the defendant. Holdsworth is of the opinion that the gist of this action was unlawful detention. Holdsworth bases this on a case from Bracton's notebookBracton, Note Book, case 824 in which the plaintiff alleges that \\"William Nutach in the peace of God and of our Lord the King and of his bailiffs unjustly detains (injuste detinuit) from her three pigs which were lost to her.\\" The action depended upon loss of the chattel, which had come to the hands of a defendant who had refused on demand to give it up. Holdsworth deduces this case was the forerunner of the action in detinue, which also lay to recover a lost chattel. Ames is of the opinion that this case represents not so much an action, but a formal demand made in court for the return of the chattel, which, if denied, could be followed by an appeal. It is certain that an appeal could be substituted after an allegation of res adiratae had been made. It is disputed whether proceedings in res adiratae could not be brought in royal courts. Holdsworth cites a case from 1292Year Book 21 & 22 Edward I, ( R. S.), at pp. 466-468 which seems to fulfill all the requirements of res adiratae. \\"Note that where a thing belonging to a man is lost, he may count that he (the finder) tortiously detains it. Etc. and tortiously for this that whereas he lost the said thing on such a day, etc. he (the loser) on such a day etc., found it in the house of such a one and prayed him to restore the thing but he would not restore it, etc., to his damage, etc.; and if he etc. In this case the demandant must prove by his law (his own hand the twelfth; i.e. wager of law) that he lost the thing.\\" Ames said of detinue \\"In the first place, the count must allege a bailment, and a traverse of this allegation was an answer to the action.\\"Lectt. P. 71 However, there are many instances where allegation of bailment was not necessary for an action in detinue. Holdsworth cites a 1313 case in which the counsel. Toudeby for the defendant pleaded no allegation of bailment, but Scrope, the counsel for the demandant (plaintiff), replied that, if the defendant carried off the chattels and a writ was brought to recover them, it was no answer to say that the chattels had not been bailed to the plaintiff. Still the case turned on the question of bailment.Year Book 6 Edw. II (XXXIV, S. S.), p. 167 In 1343, the defendant was driven to a traverse in these terms: \\"We tell you that the horse did not come into our keeping, nor do we detain the horse, as he counts.\\"Year Book 17 & 18 Edw. ( R. S.), pp. 514, 516 In 1410, both counsel agreed that an action of detinue lay whether the chattel was bailed or whether the defendant found it in the road. The plea simply amounted to an assumption that the chattels had come into the hands of the defendant (devenerunt ad manus), and were wrongfully withheld from the plaintiff.Year Book 11 Henry IV, H., pl. 20, at f. 46 b Detinue sur trover Traditionally, clothes bailed then destroyed, led to an action in trespass. After Bracton an action in detinue applied, but not in every case. During the fifteenth century, this plea gave rise to a special form of the action of detinue known as \\"detinue sur trover\\" which should be distinguished from the action of \\"trespass on the case sur trover\\". The latter would be shortened into simple trover. Littleton remarked that the count or plea of \\"per interventionem (sur trover) was a newfound halliday.\\"Year Book 33 Henry VI, T., f. 26, pl. 12 The action probably represents the development of a simpler form of pleading in which it was unnecessary to allege by what means the chattel had come into the defendant's hands. Nevertheless, the counts sur bailment and sur trover seem to have had the effect of drawing a distinction between two forms of action, detinue sur trover and detinue sur bailment. This distinction represented the recognition of the two forms of wrongful detention: one based on a purely tortious wrong and the other connected with an agreement between the parties. Detinue sur trover is of greater interest in tort because it covers a more general field. It was distinguished from trespass since it did not involve any interference with the physical possession of the plaintiff. It did not depend on a failure to fulfill a condition to return the chattel which had been delivered to the defendant. There was no necessity for an agreement between the parties. There were certain defects in detinue sur trover. Wager of law was a possible defense in certain kinds of cases. Wager of law involved the use by a defendant of witnesses, some of whom may have had no knowledge of the case to testify. If a large number of these \\"witnesses\\" testified, the defendant would prevail. It was a form of sanctioned perjury. The courts began to severely limit wager of law by the middle of the fourteenth century. No action lay where the chattel was returned but in a damaged or impaired condition. In 1478, Catesby said, \\"And in the same manner I deliver my robes to you to keep for me and you wear them so that they perish, I shall have an action of detinue for in all these cases the property is not altered, and afterwards an action on the case and recover damages for the loss sustained by your using the clothes.\\" Year Book 18 Edward IV, H., f. 23, pl. 5 the same opinion was reiterated in 1510 by Serjeant Moore, although an action would lie for trespass on the case. In the cases of a chattel damaged or destroyed, the plaintiff must choose some remedy other than detinue.Keilw. 160, pl. 2 This was also true if the bailee dealt with the property in an improper manner as noted by Littleton in 1462: \\"I bail to you my cloak and you burn it, I will have a writ of trespass on the case against you (and not detinue).\\" Year Book 2 Edw. IV, P., pl. 9 It was doubtful whether detinue lay where, after bailment, a third party had destroyed the chattel bailed. The action lay against a bailee who had himself been responsible for the loss, as where a charter had been found by the jury to have been burned.Year Book 17 & 18 Edw. III [R &S;] p. 2; Fifoot, p. 29. It was disputed whether this remedy applied to the action of a third party. Judge Brian said, \\"If I bail my horse to a smith to shoe and he bails it to another smith who damages the horse an action will not lie against him.\\" The second party was a stranger to the bailment, but the other justices were opposed to this opinion of Brian.Year Book 12 Edw. IV, M. F. 13. Pl. 9Abr. Accion sur le Cas, 25 T., 27 Hen. VI By the time of Bracton, the old preference for an action in trespass exclusively was seen to have softened somewhat, with certain actions allowed against a third party in detinue. This began to make wager at law ineffective as a defense. The judges of the time were growing wary of wager at law as a legitimate defense, anyway. This attitude allowing detinue was not universally held, as can be seen from the cases noted in this section.Plucknett, T, p. 115, p. 647, \\"A Concise History of the Common Law\\", 1956 Butterworth and Co.  Bracton on third party liability  A case from 1200 directed the verdict against a bailee who claimed chattels in his keeping were stolen during a fire at his property. In the opinion of Bracton, if goods were unlawfully taken from the possession of the bailee, it was he who had the action against the wrongdoer, not the original bailor. The action was appeal of larceny or trespass.Bracton f. 151Pollock and Maitland, vol ii, p. 170 \\"History of English Law\\", Cambridge, 1968 Even in the time of Bracton, there was pressure to change this arrangement and allow the bailor to bring an action directly against the third party.P & M, p. 170, ibid. Under the old rules, the bailee had an absolute responsibility to the bailor for safe keeping of the goods. A case from 1200 directed the verdict for lost goods against the bailee who claimed they had been lost and stolen during a fire at his property.Selden Society, pl 8 Glanvill also held this opinion.Glanvill, x. 13 Glanvill held that the bailee was absolutely bound to restore the lost chattel or its value. Bracton appeared to mitigate the old rule. If the bailee had shown due diligence, there was room for mitigation of damages. However, it was never clear how Bracton would decide to proportion damages.Bracton, f. 62 b, 99;Fleta, p. 120-1Scrutton, Law Quarterly Review, I. 136P & M, v. ii, p. 170-171 ibid. Bracton's description has been called Romanesque, and premature.Holmes, \\"Common Law\\" p. 176P & M, HEL, p. 171, ibid. Even by Bracton's time, lawyers were becoming accustomed to the notion that bailees did not have an absolute liability for chattels bailed to their tending, assuming they used reasonable care or diligence in handling them. In Bracton's text, there was the beginning of the notion that bailee had an action for loss, assuming he had some interest in the chattel beyond mere possession. That must be some kind of responsibility for its care and safety. It had not developed very far. Bracton more than once seems to require that the appellor shall complain of a theft of his own goods or of goods for which he has been made responsible, namely, intravit in solutionem erga dominum suum.Bracton f.103 b, 146the actual Latin words were taken from a 1203 case, Select Pleas of the Crown, pl. 88, 126 The time between conveyance and possession was ill- defined. The time of bailee possession was called the custodia or \\"custody\\". The bailee had three courses of action: (1) the appeal of larceny; (2) the action of trespass; (3) the action of detinue.P & M, HEL, p. 172 ibid. Bracton wrote of detinue \\"It would seem at first sight that the action in which a movable is demanded should be as well in rem as in personam, for he whom the thing is demanded and the possessor is bound to restore that thing; but in truth it is merely in personam for he from whom the thing is demanded is not absolutely bound to restore it, but is bound alternatively to restore it or its price; and this, whether the thing be forthcoming or no. And therefore, if a man vindicates his movable chattel as having been carried off for any cause, or as having been lent (commodatum), he must in his action define its price, and propound his claim thus: - I, such a one, demand that such a one do restore to me such a thing of such a price: - or - I complain that such a one detains from me, or has robbed me of, such a thing of such a price: - otherwise, no price being named, the vindication of a movable thing will fail.\\" Bracton, f. 120 bBracton and Azo, p 172P & M, HEL, ibid. p. 174-175  The question of ownership and possession  A case from 1292 debated whether an action in detinue could be brought against a widow. From a case in 1292, the following was reported: \\"I bail a charter for safe custody to a married woman; her husband dies; can I bring an action of detinue against her, it being clear law that a married woman not bind herself by contract?\\" Huntingdon: \\"Sir, our plaint is of a tortious detinue of a charter which this lady is now detaining from us. We crave judgment that she ought to answer for her tort.\\" Lowther: \\"The cause of your action is the bailment; and at that time she could not bind herself. We crave judgment if she must now answer for a thing about which she could not bind herself.\\" Spigurnel: \\"If you had bailed to the lady thirty marks for safe custody while she was coverte for return to you when you should demand them, would she be now bound to answer? I think not. And so in this case.\\" Howard: \\"The cases are not similar; for in a writ of debt you shall say debet, while here you shall say iniuste detinet. And again, in this case, an action arises from a tortious detainer and not from bailment. We crave judgment.\\" Lowther: \\"We repeat what we have said.\\" Year Book 20-1 Edward I, p. 191 The question of what was the nature of the action of detinue remained open till the present time.P & M, HEL, ibid. p. 180 This case illustrates two points. Ownership was key to determining the kind of action to be brought for remedy. Ownership was unclear, and difficult to define at the end of the thirteenth century. Detinue separated from debt  Glanvill described one action which had features of both debt and detinue. They were the same. In his time, the form of the writ was a demand for a sum of money which could be issued for various reasons. \\"Debt\\" or detinue could be demanded for return of the loan of money, the price of sale, the loan of a chattel, letting to hire, or a deposit. The writ was available for a creditor against a surety on the default of the principal debtor. Glanvill speaks of debt and its writ as being a retrieval of \\"debt that is due\\", or detinue. Later, and by the time of Bracton, detinue had been more or less separated from primary actions in debt, Detinue had come to be restricted to actions against bailees. After Bracton, the special situation of de bonis asportatis, the taking of chattels by a bailee or theft of these from a bailee gave rise to the special situation of trover. Trover became fully formed in the reign of Elizabeth I of England. By the end of Bracton's life and into the reign of Edward I, debt was confined to contract law, while detinue was concerned with the developing issues of personal property.Plucknett, T, p. 364 \\"A Concise History of the Common Law\\", Butterworth and Co, 1956 Breaking the bulk  Occasionally, the issue of a transporting agent, a bailee who was charged with moving chattels would open the wrapped packages and misappropriate the contents. This was called breaking the bulk. In 1315, an action in detinue was allowed for \\"breaking the bulk\\".Year Book, Edward II (Selden Society), xvii, 136 Later, in 1473, breaking the bulk was determined to be a felony, and not an action in pure detinue.Year Book 13 Edward IV, Pasch. 5 (1473)Plucknett, p. 449, ibid. Detinue in United States law  In the United States, detinue is a possessory action having for its object the recovery of specific personal property and damages for its detention.Wallace v. Cox, 100 Neb 601, 160 NW 992 At common law an action of detinue would lie for the recovery of specific personal property unlawfully detained, or its value, and for damages for its detention.McFadden v. Crawford, 36 W. Va. 671, 15 SE 408 Detinue differs from replevin in that possession of the chattel in controversy is not changed until after the judgment in detinue, whereas in replevin possession is changed at the beginning of the proceeding.Badger v. Phinney, 15 Mass 35966 Am. Jur. 2nd \\"Replevin\\" ¬ß 160 The gist of an action in detinue is that the defendant is wrongfully in possession of personal property which belongs to the plaintiff Gary Acceptance Corp. v. Napillo, 86 Ill App. 2nd 257, 230 NE 2nd 73 whereas replevin lies only where there has been a wrongful taking or seizure of the property.66 Am. Jur. 2nd \\"Replevin\\" ¬ß¬ß 5 and 160 Detinue is distinguished from common-law trover which is for the recovery of damages for the wrongful conversion of personal property.66 Am.

Jur. 2nd \\"Replevin\\" ¬ß¬ß 160-170  England and Wales  In England and Wales, detinue was abolished from 1 January 1978 by the Torts (Interference with Goods) Act 1977. However, the tort of conversion was extended at the same time to cover circumstances that had previously been covered only by detinue.

Nuschke was born in Frohburg in the Kingdom of Saxony. In 1910 he was elected General Secretary of the liberal Progressive People's Party (Fortschrittliche Volkspartei) of Kassel. In the same year he became chief editor of the Berliner Tageblatt and in 1915 co- editor of the Berliner Volkszeitung. Nuschke soon joined the Liberal Union (Freisinnige Vereinigung), left-wing liberal organisation, and became its general secretary of Kassel in 1906. As this group fused with other left- liberal organisations (in 1910) to form the Progressive People's Party, Nuschke became the general secretary of the new party in Kassel. In 1918 he took part in establishing the German Democratic Party. In 1919 he was a delegate to the National Congress of Weimar and from 1921 to 1933 he was a member of the Reichstag. In 1920s Nuschke was at times the deputy chairman of the German Democratic Party. Nuschke was one of the founders of the republican Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold and became the general secretary of the German State Party in 1931 (i.e. a successor to the German Democratic Party). After the Nazis gained power in 1933 Nuschke joined the opposition. After the 1944 assassination attempt on Hitler's life, he went into hiding. After World War II, he became involved in the politics of the Soviet Occupation Zone (SBZ)--what became East Germany. Unlike most of the former German Democratic Party members, Nuschke did not take part in forming the LDPD/FDP, but became one of the co-founders of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in June 1945, along with Ferdinand Friedensburg, Ernst Lemmer and Walther Schreiber. In 1946 Nuschke was elected in the party's executive committee. From 1946 to 1952 he was a member of the Landtag of Brandenburg. In 1947, after the deposition of party chairmen Jakob Kaiser and Ernst Lemmer by the Soviet military authorities, Nuschke became acting chairman and after the party congress of 1948, party chairman. In March 1948, Nuschke - alongside Wilhelm Pieck (SED) and Wilhelm K√ºlz (LDPD) - was chairman of the German People's Council (Deutscher Volksrat) that drafted the Constitution of the German Democratic Republic. In 1949 Nuschke became a member of the Provisional People's Chamber of the GDR. He remained a member of parliament until his death. After the formal establishment of the German Democratic Republic, Nuschke became Deputy Prime Minister and chief of the Church Office. Nuschke was a loyal supporter of the SED regime, and gradually pushed out those CDU members not willing to do the Communists' bidding. This culminated in the party's 1952 conference, at which the CDU formally declared itself a socialist party. On 17 June 1953, during the East German uprising, Nuschke and his driver were kidnapped and brought to West Berlin. Some American military recognised him and saved him from the angry masses. He and his driver were brought to a police station, but released on 19 June. After that Nuschke and his driver returned to East Berlin. In a spontaneous interview given to RIAS reporter Peter Schultze, Nuschke claimed that the East German government had popular support and that the demonstrators included West Berliners. In 1954 he received the Patriotic Order of the GDR and in 1955 he received an honorary degree.

Deer's investigative nonfiction book, The Doctor Who Fooled the World, was published in September 2020 by Johns Hopkins University Press. Career  After graduating in philosophy from the University of Warwick, he became editor and press officer for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and was a member of The Leveller magazine collective. Subsequently he joined The Times, then The Sunday Times, first as a business news subeditor and then as a staff news reporter and feature writer. In the 1980s, under then Sunday Times editor Andrew Neil, Deer was the UK's first social affairs correspondent, and between 1990 and 1992 reported from the United States. = Investigations = In 1986, one of Deer's early investigations exposed research by British scientist Professor Michael Briggs at Deakin University, Australia into the safety of the contraceptive pill. Deer's reports revealed that numerous of Briggs's studies were fabricated so as to give a positive profile for the products' cardiovascular safety. The research was largely financed by the German drug company Schering AG. In 1994, his investigation of the Wellcome Trust led to the withdrawal in the UK of the blockbuster antibiotic, Septrin (also sold under the name Bactrim) and the sale by the Wellcome Trust of its drug company subsidiary. In 2005, the withdrawal of the painkiller Vioxx was followed by an investigation by Deer into the people responsible for the drug's introduction. In 2006, Deer's Dispatches documentary \\"The drug trial that went wrong\\",The drug trial that went wrong Dispatches Channel 4 television (September 2006) investigated the experimental monoclonal antibody TGN1412. It was nominated for a Royal Television Society journalism award.

He created circular paintings, exposed on a cylindrical surface and viewed from the inside at a lookout point. The painting was believed to reproduce the original scene with high fidelity. Biography Viewing the panorama painting Franz (Fran√ßois) Roubaud was born on 3/15 June 1856 in Odessa to Honor√© Fortun√© Alexis Roubaud and his wife Madelaine n√©e S√©n√®que. Franz was the fourth of five children in a Catholic family; his father was a bookseller and stationer, originally from Marseille. He studied at the Odessa Drawing School. In 1877 Roubaud went to Munich and studied at the Munich Academy of Fine Arts. He then settled in Saint Petersburg, working in the Imperial Academy of Arts and painting huge panoramas of historical battles. In 1904-12 Roubaud taught at the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts as a professor. During this time he painted the Siege of Sevastopol, a panoramic painting. In the mid-19th century, the various panoramic paintings became a fashionable way to depict landscapes and historical events. The panorama was a 360-degree visual medium patented by the artist Robert Barker in 1787. This was a new thing for the time and for the audiences in Europe of this period these paintings were a sensation. The paintings created a new illusion, transporting the viewer into a virtual reality, creating the perception of being physically present in the middle of the events. When standing in the middle of the 360 degree panorama this created the impression of standing in a new environment.[Mieszkowski, Jan, Watching war, 2012, Stanford, California Stanford University Press,, p.91] He became renowned thanks to the giant panoramic paintings he executed during his lifetime. Roubaud's works were so large that they required specially built pavilions to exhibit them. These paintings are one of the few panoramas still extant of a popular 19th-century genre. The viewer stands in the centre of the circular panorama, and observes the various scenes whilst walking around and observing the panorama from different viewing angles. In 1913 Roubaud left Russia for Germany, settling in Munich, where he lived for the rest of his life. He died on 13 March 1928.

The painting was exhibited in a rotunda, a special building constructed in a circular shape. The size of the painting is enormous, but it was a necessity for the realistic depiction of military scenes because of the huge number of participants and the wide sweep of the scenery. Roubaud worked on this painting for almost three years, starting in 1901. He researched the historical events by traveling to Sevastopol, reading about the battle itself as well as by reading historical documents that described the different scenes and incidents during the war. He also talked to surviving participants. Roubaud made his first sketches in Saint Petersburg. He kept working on the painting later at the Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts where he decided to use a canvas 14 m high by 115 m long. When he finished the painting, it was displayed in Sevastopol in the summer of 1904, on the fiftieth anniversary of the defence of the city.Sevastopol Panorama =Battle of Borodino Panorama= =Other works= File:–§—Ä–∞–Ω—Ü –†—É–±–æ - –ö–∏—Ä–≥–∏–∑—Å–∫–∏–π –≤—Å–∞–¥–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤ —Å —Ñ–ª–∞–≥–æ–º.jpgKirghyz horseman with a red flag File:Franz Roubaud Tscherkasse.jpgRider with weapon File:–§—Ä–∞–Ω—Ü –†—É–±–æ - –ò–≥—Ä–∞ –ö–æ–∫–ø–∞—Ä.jpgPlaying Kokpar File:–§—Ä–∞–Ω—Ü –†—É–±–æ - –ö–∞–≤–∫–∞–∑—Å–∫–∞—è —Å—Ü–µ–Ω–∞.jpgCaucasian scene File:Franz Roubaud Tscherkessischer Reiter.jpgCircassian Horsemen File:Rubo Kazaki.jpgCossacks near a mountain river File:–§—Ä–∞–Ω—Ü –†—É–±–æ - –ë–∞–∑–∞—Ä–Ω—ã–π –¥–µ–Ω—å.jpgMarket day File:–§—Ä–∞–Ω—Ü –†—É–±–æ - –õ–∞–≥–µ—Ä—å –Ω–∞ –±–µ—Ä–µ–≥—É —Ä–µ–∫–∏.jpgRiverside camp File:–§—Ä–∞–Ω—Ü –†—É–±–æ - –°–µ–Ω–æ –∫–æ—Ä–∑–∏–Ω—É.jpgThe hay cart File:Franz Roubaud.

It is divided into four faculties: * Catholic Theology * Law * Cultural and Social Sciences * Natural Sciences Established in 1622, the university was closed in 1810 and re-established in 1962. Today, it has around 18,000 students and 2,800 employees and is the largest educational institution in Salzburg state.  Benedictine University  On 23 July 1622, Archbishop Paris Lodron appointed the scholar Albert Keuslin first rector of the Benedictine university. Keuslin, a graduate of the Jesuit University of Dillingen, had established the Akademisches Gymnasium, a secondary school, at Salzburg five years earlier. By resolution of Emperor Ferdinand II, issued on October 8, the Gymnasium was raised to a university. While the Thirty Years' War raged outside the Archbishopric of Salzburg, the university was built up and maintained by a federation of Benedictine abbeys from Salzburg, Switzerland, Bavaria and Austria. In its early years, courses taught were theology, divinity, philosophy, law, and medicine. During the Napoleonic Wars, the Prince-Archbishopric was secularized as the Electorate of Salzburg in 1803. It was ruled by Archduke Ferdinand III of Austria, a brother of Emperor Francis I, who established a Faculty of Medicine. After Salzburg was annexed by the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1810, however, the university was closed on 24 December and replaced by a Lyzeum college with sections for divinity and philosophy, as well as a school for medicine and surgery. After the Napoleonic Wars, Salzburg became part of the Austrian Empire. The divinity section was again converted to a faculty in 1850. In World War I, plans were evolved to relocate the Francis Joseph University from Czernowitz to Salzburg, though never carried out.  University of Salzburg  The University of Salzburg was not re-established until 1962, with a faculty of Catholic theology and a faculty of philosophy. Classes resumed in 1964, with a faculty of law added the following year. In 1975, a new federal law regulated the organisation of all Austrian universities. The University of Salzburg created four academic divisions: the Faculty of Catholic Theology, the Faculty of Law, the Faculty of Humanities, and the Faculty of Natural Sciences. A fifth division, the Faculty of Medicine, was not realized. In 1995, the organisation of Austrian universities was further restructured with more faculty autonomy. The university gradually incorporated new academic programs through 2004 into 32 Fachbereiche or ‚Äúdepartments‚Äù, and again, decided not to create a Faculty of Medicine. Locations The University of Salzburg has no central campus, occupying several buildings in Salzburg's historic centre: parts of the Salzburg Residenz building (Toskanatrakt) and on Kapitelgasse south of Salzburg Cathedral. The university library is located between the Kollegienkirche (the University Church) and the Gro√ües Festspielhaus; attached to it is the Gro√üe Aula, or ceremonial hall. The traditional faculty building of Humanities (Communication Studies, Sociology and Political Science) is located by the Rudolfskai, only 100 metres from Mozartplatz and Papagenoplatz. The Faculty of Sciences is housed in the second largest building in Salzburg after Hohensalzburg Fortress, and is located just further south next to Schloss Freisaal Castle and Frohnburg Castle. Completeted in 2011, the Unipark Nonntal campus (replacing the old location at the Akademiestra√üe) is home to the departments of modern languages, and cultural and social sciences. The building is 17,000 square metres in size, with 5,500 students and 300 academic staff. There is a library and an Auditorium Maximum.

He was in charge, under a King of Spain commission, of organizing the School of Mines in M√©xico City and so was responsible for building an architectural jewel known as the \\"Palacio de Miner√≠a\\". Elhuyar left Mexico after the Mexican War of Independence, when most of the Spanish residents in Mexico were expelled. Life He was born in Logro√±o, La Rioja, Spain son of Basque-French parents from Hasparren, France. Between 1773 and 1777, Elh√∫yar studied medicine, surgery and chemistry, as well as mathematics, physics and natural history with his brother Juan Jos√© Elhuyar in Paris. After graduating, he returned to Spain, where he exercised himself in the study of mineralogy, specially that of the Basque Country and Navarre, where he resided. In 1781, he was appointed a member of the Real Sociedad Bascongada de Amigos del Pa√≠s (Royal Basque Society of Friends to the Country), an enlightened institution thanks to which he started teaching as professor of mineralogy and metallurgy in Bergara, the seat of both the Vascongada Society and the University of Vergara (nowadays merged with the University of the Basque Country). During those years, he published numerous articles and dossiers about minerals, ways to extract and purify them, etc., which made him famous throughout Europe as one of the top experts on the subject. In 1780, he started working in the Laboratorium Chemicum of Vergara along with Fran√ßois Chavaneau, with whom he was the first to purify platinum. After several months, he was the first person to discover and isolate tungsten, of which he's credited, along with his brother Juan Jos√©, as its discoverer. He also collaborated with Joseph- Louis Proust, the famous French chemist at the service of king Charles IV of Spain, who directed the National Laboratory in Segovia. In 1783, he visited several European universities, such as the School of Mines of Freiberg, at which he lectured on metallurgy and mine machinery; the University of Uppsala, where he collaborated with Torbern Olof Bergman; and K√∂ping, where he visited Carl Wilhelm Scheele, the one who announced Elh√∫yar's discovery of tungsten, and for some reason is credited for having made the discovery himself. After his return to Spain, in 1785 he renounced his professorship and, in July 1786, was appointed General Director of Mines in Mexico. Before departing to his new office, he toured Europe again from 1786 to 1788 in order to study Born's method on refining silver. During this trip, he married Joan Raab in Vienna, in 1787. For the next thirty three years, he resided in Mexico City, where the crown founded the capital's School of Mines (January 1, 1792), with Elhuyar as its first director. During his tenure, he commissioned and directed the construction of that institution's seat, the Palacio de Miner√≠a, which was finished in 1813 and is considered one of the jewels of the Spanish American neoclassicism. He also visited and improved several of the existing Royal Mines of Mexico, dramatically increasing their productivity due to the introduction of new methods of exploitation. He aided Alexander von Humboldt during his time in New Spain, along with other mining experts then in Mexico, allowing Humboldt's section on mining in his Political essay on the Kingdom of New Spain to be replete with statistics and insights. After Mexican Independence, he returned to Spain, where, due to his wide experience in modern minery methods, he was appointed Minister of Minery in 1822, and supervised the modern mining of the mines in Almad√©n, Guadalcanal, and R√≠o Tinto. After falling from his ministry, he was appointed yet again General Director of Mines, and resumed his research activities in chemistry from this quieter office till his death in Madrid on January 6, 1833.

A contrarian believes that certain crowd behavior among investors can lead to exploitable mispricings in securities markets. For example, widespread pessimism about a stock can drive a price so low that it overstates the company's risks, and understates its prospects for returning to profitability. Identifying and purchasing such distressed stocks, and selling them after the company recovers, can lead to above-average gains. Conversely, widespread optimism can result in unjustifiably high valuations that will eventually lead to drops, when those high expectations don't pan out. Avoiding (or short- selling) investments in over-hyped investments reduces the risk of such drops. These general principles can apply whether the investment in question is an individual stock, an industry sector, or an entire market or any other asset class. Some contrarians have a permanent bear market view, while the majority of investors bet on the market going up. However, a contrarian does not necessarily have a negative view of the overall stock market, nor do they have to believe that it is always overvalued, or that the conventional wisdom is always wrong. Rather, a contrarian seeks opportunities to buy or sell specific investments when the majority of investors appear to be doing the opposite, to the point where that investment has become mispriced. While more \\"buy\\" candidates are likely to be identified during market declines (and vice versa), these opportunities can occur during periods when the overall market is generally rising or falling. Similarity to value investing Contrarian investing is related to value investing in that the contrarian is also looking for mispriced investments and buying those that appear to be undervalued by the market. In the bible on contrarian thinking, \\"The Art of Contrary Thinking\\" (1954) by Humphrey B. Neill, he notes it is easy to find something to go contrary to, but difficult to discover when everybody believes it. He concludes \\"when everybody thinks alike, everybody is likely to be wrong.\\" Some well-known value investors such as John Neff have questioned whether there is a such thing as a \\"contrarian\\", seeing it as essentially synonymous with value investing. One possible distinction is that a value stock, in finance theory, can be identified by financial metrics such as the book value or P/E ratio. A contrarian investor may look at those metrics, but is also interested in measures of \\"sentiment\\" regarding the stock among other investors, such as sell-side analyst coverage and earnings forecasts, trading volume, and media commentary about the company and its business prospects. In the example of a stock that has dropped because of excessive pessimism, one can see similarities to the \\"margin of safety\\" that value investor Benjamin Graham sought when purchasing stocks‚Äîessentially, being able to buy shares at a discount to their intrinsic value. Arguably, that margin of safety is more likely to exist when a stock has fallen a great deal, and that type of drop is usually accompanied by negative news and general pessimism. Along with this, although more dangerous, is shorting overvalued stocks. This requires 'deep pockets' in that an overvalued security may continue to rise, due to over- optimism, for quite some time. Eventually, the short-seller believes, the stock will 'crash and burn'. Notable contrarian investors *Bill Ackman is a contrarian investor who twice reinvested heavily in beaten-down Valeant Pharmaceuticals against prevailing market sentiments. Later, he short-sold Herbalife, but was forced to take a large loss after the stock failed to fall as predicted. *Warren Buffett is a famous contrarian, who believes the best time to invest in a stock is when shortsightedness of the market has beaten down the price. *Michael Lee-Chin is a Jamaican billionaire investor who is often associated with contrarian investing. *Jim Rogers is an investor and author who is bullish on contrarian investing in Asian markets. *Marc Faber is a contrarian investor who publishes the Gloom Boom & Doom Report. *David Dreman is a money manager often associated with contrarian investing. He has authored several books on the topic and writes the \\"Contrarian\\" column in Forbes magazine. *John Maynard Keynes was an early contrarian investor. *John Neff, who managed the Vanguard Windsor fund for many years, is also considered a contrarian, though he has described himself as a value investor (and questioned the distinction). *Mark Ripple is a money manager often described as a contrarian. He has authored a book covering the topic in detail. *Paul Tudor Jones is a contrarian investor who attempts to buy and sell turning points. *Howard Marks regularly focuses his client memos on contrarian investing. * Humphrey B. Neill has been described as the father of contrary investing; see his book cited above. *Allan Gray was a noted South African contrarian investor that believed the best value was typically to be had when the market was down. Examples of contrarian investing Economist John Maynard Keynes was an early contrarian investor when he managed the endowment for King's College, Cambridge from the 1920s to '40s. While most university endowments of the time invested almost exclusively in land and fixed income assets, Keynes was perhaps the first institutional investor to invest heavily in common stocks and international stocks. On average, Keynes's investments out-performed the U.K. market by more than 6% with a strategy similar to, but developed independently of, the value investing paradigm of Benjamin Graham and Charles Dodd.Chambers, David and Dimson, Elroy, John Maynard Keynes, Investment Innovator (June 30, 2013). Journal of Economic Perspectives, 2013, Vol 27, No 3, pages 1‚Äì18, Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2287262 or http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2287262 Commonly used contrarian indicators for investor sentiment are Volatility Indexes (informally also referred to as \\"Fear indexes\\"), like VIX, which by tracking the prices of financial options, gives a numeric measure of how pessimistic or optimistic market actors at large are. A low number in this index indicates a prevailing optimistic or confident investor outlook for the future, while a high number indicates a pessimistic outlook. By comparing the VIX to the major stock-indexes over longer periods of time, it is evident that peaks in this index generally present good buying opportunities. Another example of a simple contrarian strategy is Dogs of the Dow. When purchasing the stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average that have the highest relative dividend yield, an investor is often buying many of the \\"distressed\\" companies among those 30 stocks. These \\"Dogs\\" have high yields not because dividends were raised, but rather because their share prices fell. The company is experiencing difficulties, or simply is at a low point in their business cycle. By repeatedly buying such stocks, and selling them when they no longer meet the criteria, the \\"Dogs\\" investor is systematically buying the least-loved of the Dow 30, and selling them when they become loved again. When the Dot com bubble started to deflate, an investor would have profited by avoiding the technology stocks that were the subject of most investors' attention. Asset classes such as value stocks and real estate investment trusts were largely ignored by the financial press at the time, despite their historically low valuations, and many mutual funds in those categories lost assets. These investments experienced strong gains amidst the large drops in the overall US stock market when the bubble unwound. The Fidelity Contrafund was founded in 1967 \\"to take a contrarian view, investing in out-of-favor stocks or sectors\\", but over time has abandoned this strategy to become a large cap growth fund. Relationship to behavioral finance Contrarians are attempting to exploit some of the principles of behavioral finance, and there is significant overlap between these fields. For example, studies in behavioral finance have demonstrated that investors as a group tend to overweight recent trends when predicting the future; a poorly performing stock will remain bad, and a strong performer will remain strong. This lends credence to the contrarian's belief that investments may drop \\"too low\\" during periods of negative news, due to incorrect assumptions by other investors, regarding the long-term prospects for the company. Furthermore, Foye and Mramor (2016) find that country-specific factors have a strong influence on measures of value (such as the book-to-market ratio) this leads them to conclude that the reasons why value stocks outperform are both country-specific and behavioral.

By analogy with the anatomical definition of \\"rib\\", the ribs attach to the main spar, and by being repeated at frequent intervals, form a skeletal shape for the wing. Usually ribs incorporate the airfoil shape of the wing, and the skin adopts this shape when stretched over the ribs. Type of ribs There are several types of ribs. Form-ribs, plate-type ribs, truss ribs, closed- ribs, forged ribs and milled ribs, where form-ribs are used for light to medium loading and milled ribs offer the greatest strength. * Form-ribs are made from a sheet of metal bent into shape, such as a U-profile. This profile is placed on the skin, just like a stringer, but then in the other direction. * Plate-type ribs consist of sheet-metal, which has upturned edges and (often has) weight-saving holes cut into it. * Truss ribs are built up out of profiles that are joined together. These joints require great attention during design and manufacture. The ribs may be light or heavy in design which make them suitable for a wide range of loads. * Closed-ribs are constructed from profiles and sheet metal and are suitable for closing off sections of the wing (e.g.: the fuel tank). Here too, particular care must be taken with the joints and this type of rib is also suitable for application in a variety of loading conditions. * Forged ribs are manufactured using heavy press-machinery. The result is fairly rough; for more refined parts, high-pressure presses are required, which are very expensive. Forged pieces (usually) have to undergo further treatment (for smoother edges and holes). Forged ribs are used for sections where very high loads apply - near the undercarriage for example. * Milled ribs are solid structures. They are manufactured by milling away excess material from a solid block of metal (usually using computer-controlled milling machines). The shape of these ribs is always accurately defined. Such ribs are used under similar conditions as those for forged ribs. Ribs are made out of wood, metal, plastic, composites, foam.

Ribs. powered hang gliders, ultralights, windmills Windmill with ribs in its wings are aircraft that have versions that use ribs to form the wing shape. For full size and flying model aircraft wing structures that are usually made of wood, ribs can either be in one piece (forming the airfoil at that rib's \\"station\\" in the wing), or be in a three- piece format, with the rib web being the part that the one-piece rib consisted of, with capstrips for the upper and lower edging of the rib, running from the leading edge to the trailing edge, being the other two component parts.

Calls may be \\"natural\\" (that is, are based on a holding of the suit bid, or a balanced distribution in the case of a notrump bid) or \\"\\" (show a feature unrelated to the named denomination). A bridge convention is an agreement about an artificial call or a set of related artificial calls. Contract bridge is a trick-taking card game played by four players in two competing partnerships in which a sequence of , also known as the auction, precedes the play of the cards. The purpose of this bidding is for players to inform their partners of the content of their hand and to arrive at a suitable contract at which to play the hand (or to prevent the opponents from arriving at a suitable contract). Although bidding is often \\"natural\\" (describing a hand by simple reference to possession, shape, and strength of the named suit) players may also bid using conventions, which assign more specific information to certain calls, particularly at the more advanced levels of competitive play. Bill Root defines \\"convention\\" as, \\"A specific agreement between partners to give an unusual meaning to a bid\\". However, some conventions, for example, Stayman, are very widely used and cannot be said to be unusual. Conventions are often named after their ostensive author (the Drury convention), their promulgator (the Stayman convention), or something about the methodology itself (the strong two clubs convention). The term conventional is also used to describe certain opening leads, discards and signals that have specific agreed meanings. Conventions to be played must be agreed by partners before play begins and must be disclosed to their opponents, either in advance by the use of or by alerts, announcements, and answers to questions about one's partner's bids once bidding has begun. Generally, this disclosure also must include the negative implications of choosing the bid over another alternative. Failure to reveal fully the existence and meaning of a convention generally constitutes an illegal communication of information between partners. Perhaps the most widely known and used conventions are Blackwood, which asks for and gives information about the number of aces and kings held, Stayman convention, used to discover a 4-4 fit in a major suit following an opening no trump bid, Jacoby transfers, used to find a 5-3 fit in a major suit, and strong two clubs to show a very strong hand (usually at least 22 HCP). It could be argued that takeout doubles are conventional but their usage is so widespread that they may be considered a natural call. Classification Bridge conventions can be classified according to their purpose: *Opening bid conventions **Strong opening bids are used for hands stronger than the \\"normal\\" opening bid range (12-20 points in natural systems, 12-15/17 points in artificial systems) ***Strong two clubs in natural systems denote hands of 22+ high card points ***Benjamin Twos in natural systems ***Strong one club in strong club systems denotes hands of 16-17+ points **Weak opening bids are used for hands weaker than the normal opening bid range, but with preemptive value: ***Standard preemptive bids, including \\"weak two\\" Bids ***Kamikaze 1NT ***Ekren ***Muiderberg **Other opening bid conventions: ***Flannery ***Multi 2 diamonds ***Namyats *Fit- seeking conventions are used in constructive bidding, in order to find a fit-- a suit suitable to be a trump suit **Baron **Checkback Stayman **Forcing notrump **Jacoby transfers **New minor forcing **Stayman **Bergen raises **LTC **Jacoby 2NT (also known as Stenberg 2NT) *Slam-seeking conventions are used in constructive bidding to investigate the possibility of a slam contract (Main article: Slam seeking conventions) **Asking bids **Blackwood **Cue bids **Gerber **Grand slam force **Last train **Quantitative notrump bids **Relay bids **Splinter bid **Serious 3NT *Defensive conventions or interventions are used to show a specific type of hand after the opponents have opened the bidding **Takeout double **Unassuming Cue Bid in reply to overcalls **Lebensohl over weak two bids **Defenses over 1 NT, including two- and multi- suited overcalls: *** Astro, Aspro, Asptro *** Cappelletti *** CoCa *** CRASH *** DONT *** Hamilton *** Landy *** Lionel *** Meckwell *** Multi-defense *** Multi-Landy *** Suction **Two-suited overcalls over suit openings, like ***Copenhagen convention ***CRO ***Ghestem ***Leaping Michaels ***Michaels cuebid ***Raptor convention ***Roman two-suiters ***Unusual notrump *Counter- interventions present a countermeasure after opponents' conventional and natural interventions: **Lebensohl **Negative double **Negative free bid **Rubensohl **Unusual vs. unusual *Other: **Game trial bids **Lightner double **Texas transfer Regulations Under the rules of the sponsoring organization (for example national federations such as American Contract Bridge League (ACBL) and the English Bridge Union (EBU), zonal organizations, and the World Bridge Federation (WBF)), certain conventions are alertable, the partner of the player making the conventional call must say \\"alert\\" (or show an alert card from the bidding box) before the right-hand opponent calls. The right-hand opponent may ask the alerter about the meaning of the convention, or may proceed as usual. If the right-hand opponent does not ask about the convention, their partner may do so when it is their turn. Under ACBL and EBU rules, some conventions are also announced, for example Jacoby transfers. When a player makes a transfer bid, his or her partner must say, \\"transfer\\" (or, under EBU rules, state the suit in question). Sponsoring organizations can require players at all or some levels of competition to have a convention card which is a form completed by the partnership, containing general notes of the system, together with the definition of conventional bids, leads, discards and signals. In ACBL-sanctioned games, all pairs are obliged to have such a card, which must be identical for both members of the partnership. On the ACBL convention card, alertable conventions are shown in red and announceable ones in blue. Sponsoring organizations may also ban the usage of certain conventions or restrict their use to certain levels of competition; examples are the use of \\"ambiguous\\" suits to disrupt opponent's bidding. WBF classifies most \\"strong pass\\" and \\"either-or\\" methods into so-called HUM (highly unusual methods) and brown sticker conventions, and restricts their usage on WBF- sponsored events.WBF system policy Other zonal and national organizations often do the same. In general, ACBL tends to be more restrictive in allowed usage of conventionsACBL Convention Charts than European organizations.

Petri was born in Finland, his half-brother is Hasse Walli who is also a famous Finnish guitarist. Petri (aka Pete) founded the band called Kingston Wall in 1987, and he was the spirit behind the whole band. They came out with three albums in 1992, 1993 and 1994, and broke up in December the same year as the last album was released. The break-up was Walli's idea, as he wanted Kingston Wall to be on a hiatus for an unspecified time. After the break-up Petri travelled to Goa, India, where he had been many times before with his friend Ior Bock. (There is not much written text about Petri's and Ior's friendship, so nobody knows exactly how good friends they were). Petri ended his life by jumping off the balcony of the T√∂√∂l√∂ Church in T√∂√∂l√∂, Helsinki the following summer. Walli was later buried in the Hietaniemi Cemetery, only about one kilometer away from his place of death. Petri was a mysterious person who loved the eastern culture, philosophy, Scandinavian mythologies and most of all, playing guitar. There have been numerous rumours and speculation about the reasons of his suicide. Some say that he committed suicide because of his failed relationship with a Finnish girl called Tanja or Tanya, others say that he was in a spiritual turmoil which reflected on the lyrics and themes on Kingston Wall's last album, Tri-Logy. The song \\"For All Mankind\\" from Tri-Logy is considered by many to be Walli's suicide note. Petri's co-musicians in Kingston Wall were Jukka Jylli (bass) and Sami Kuoppam√§ki (drums). Sometimes they had guest musicians performing on their albums and live shows, such as Sakari Kukko (saxophone) and Kimmo Kajasto (synth). Drummers Petteri St√•hl and Timo \\"Tinde\\" Joutsim√§ki played drums in Kingston Wall before Kuoppam√§ki joined the group.

This is an agricultural area. Potatoes and cereals are the most important crop. Sand extractions are also important for local development.  History  The first sign of inhabitants are the remains of lake dwellings (lake dwelling) in the Antela lagoon. Due to Roman milestone findings, it is known that a Roman road (Roman road XVIII or Via Nova) passed through the area; there is also a Roman mansion in the village of Sandi√°s. In the Middle Ages, its castle witnessed the struggle for the secession of Portugal, fights among the nobles, and peasant riots. Portuguese and Southern Spanish pilgrims (Via the ‚ÄúSilver road‚Äù) went through Sandi√°s on their way to Santiago de Compostela (Way of St James).  Important landmarks  The council has an interesting and rich historical artistic heritage. As for the religious architecture, we must highlight the Gothic church of Santo Estevo de Sandi√°s, work made by Bartolom√© de Nosendo, around 1520. The hermitage of San Bieito da Uceira has an only nave and it has a front crowned with a bulrush and a bell tower with two pyramids on the sides. Inside it, there is a baroque or neo classical altarpiece with the images of San Ram√≥n, Santa Luc√≠a and San Bieito. Other churches are Santa Mar√≠a in Couso de Limia, the chapel of Arcos, the chapel of Coalloso, the chapel in Zadag√≥s‚Ä¶ leftAs for the civil constructions we can highlight the medieval tower of the Castro. Other interesting constructions are the three stately homes and a house that belonged to the nobility. The Casona in Santa Ana with L shape floor, with a big door and an interesting shield, has a chapel. The stately home of Espido presents a rectangular floor, a curious chimney and, on the main door, several shields. Its chapel with wooden baroque altarpiece is beside the building. Another stately home is the one of Penedo, risen in two stages. The first part is from the 16th century (1552) and the newest one from the 18th century (1758). This last one has rectangular floor. The chapel of the stately home dates from 1542. The third stately home is the one of Telleiro. Its U shape stands out, two shields and the wall that closes this building. It is thought to be from the late 17th century but it had important modifications in the following century. It also has a circular dovecote but it is not inside the wall. It used to have a chapel. =St. Stephen's church= An example of Galician renaissance art. Built before 1520. The front piece belongs to the ¬®manuelino¬® style (Portuguese style, rare in Galicia). The altarpiece was built in 1603 by the famous Galician sculptor Bartolome de Moure. It has a nave and a rectangular apse, arches over columns with capitals with Renaissant motives. =The tower of the old castle= Probably built in the first half of the 12th century (although some legends say it was built in the 9th century), it was located over a castrum (Celtic settlement). It participated in the Portugal secession wars (XII). In 1386 it was assaulted by the duke of Lancaster, pretender to the Castile crown. In the 15th century it was demolished by a popular riot, and rebuilt later. It was a meeting point for troops in the wars with Portugal in the 18th century. There are many legends about this castle.

Passive means that voltage-dependent changes in membrane conductance do not contribute. Neurons and other excitable cells produce two types of electrical potential: * Electrotonic potential (or graded potential), a non-propagated local potential, resulting from a local change in ionic conductance (e.g. synaptic or sensory that engenders a local current). When it spreads along a stretch of membrane, it becomes exponentially smaller (decrement). * Action potential, a propagated impulse. Electrotonic potentials represent changes to the neuron's membrane potential that do not lead to the generation of new current by action potentials.electrotonic - definition of electrotonic in the Medical dictionary - by the Free Online Medical Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia However, all action potentials are begun by electrotonic potentials depolarizing the membrane above the threshold potential which converts the electrotonic potential into an action potential. Neurons which are small in relation to their length, such as some neurons in the brain, have only electrotonic potentials (starburst amacrine cells in the retina are believed to have these properties); longer neurons utilize electrotonic potentials to trigger the action potential. Electrotonic potentials have an amplitude that is usually 5-20 mV and they can last from 1 ms up to several seconds long. In order to quantify the behavior of electrotonic potentials there are two constants that are commonly used: the membrane time constant œÑ, and the membrane length constant Œª. The membrane time constant measures the amount of time for an electrotonic potential to passively fall to 1/e or 37% of its maximum. A typical value for neurons can be from 1 to 20 ms. The membrane length constant measures how far it takes for an electrotonic potential to fall to 1/e or 37% of its amplitude at the place where it began. Common values for the length constant of dendrites are from .1 to 1 mm. Electrotonic potentials are conducted faster than action potentials, but attenuate rapidly so are unsuitable for long-distance signaling. The phenomenon was first discovered by the Eduard Pfl√ºger.  Summation  The electrotonic potential travels via electrotonic spread, which amounts to attraction of opposite- and repulsion of like-charged ions within the cell. Electrotonic potentials can sum spatially or temporally. Spatial summation is the combination of multiple sources of ion influx (multiple channels within a dendrite, or channels within multiple dendrites), whereas temporal summation is a gradual increase in overall charge due to repeated influxes in the same location. Because the ionic charge enters in one location and dissipates to others, losing intensity as it spreads, electrotonic spread is a graded response. It is important to contrast this with the all-or-none law propagation of the action potential down the axon of the neuron.  EPSPs  Electrotonic potential can either increase the membrane potential with positive charge or decrease it with negative charge. Electrotonic potentials that increase the membrane potential are called excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). This is because they depolarize the membrane, increasing the likelihood of an action potential. As they sum together they can depolarize the membrane sufficiently to push it above the threshold potential, which will then cause an action potential to occur. EPSPs are often caused by either Na+ or Ca2+ coming into the cell.  IPSPs  Electrotonic potentials which decrease the membrane potential are called inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs). They hyperpolarize the membrane and make it harder for a cell to have an action potential. IPSPs are associated with Cl‚àí entering the cell or K+ leaving the cell. IPSPs can interact with EPSPs to \\"cancel out\\" their effect.  Information Transfer  Because of the continuously varying nature of the electrotonic potential versus the binary response of the action potential, this creates implications for how much information can be encoded by each respective potential. Electrotonic potentials are able to transfer more information within a given time period than action potentials. This difference in information rates can be up to almost an order of magnitude greater for electrotonic potentials.  Cable theory  Equivalent circuit of a neuron constructed with the assumptions of simple cable theory. Cable theory can be useful for understanding how currents flow through the axons of a neuron.Rall, W in In 1855, Lord Kelvin devised this theory as a way to describe electrical properties of transatlantic telegraph cables.Kelvin WT (1855). \\"On the theory of the electric telegraph\\". Proceedings of the Royal Society. 7: 382‚Äì99. Almost a century later in 1946, Hodgkin and Rushton discovered cable theory could be applied to neurons as well. This theory has the neuron approximated as a cable whose radius does not change, and allows it to be represented with the partial differential equation : \\\\tau \\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\lambda^2 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 V}{\\\\partial x^2} - V where V(x, t) is the voltage across the membrane at a time t and a position x along the length of the neuron, and where Œª and œÑ are the characteristic length and time scales on which those voltages decay in response to a stimulus. Referring to the circuit diagram on the right, these scales can be determined from the resistances and capacitances per unit length.Purves et al. 2008, pp. 52‚Äì53. : \\\\lambda = \\\\sqrt \\\\frac{r_m}{r_\\\\ell} : \\\\tau =\\\\ r_m c_m \\\\, From these equations one can understand how properties of a neuron affect the current passing through it. The length constant Œª, increases as membrane resistance becomes larger and as the internal resistance becomes smaller, allowing current to travel farther down the neuron. The time constant œÑ, increases as the resistance and capacitance of the membrane increase, which causes current to travel more slowly through the neuron.  Ribbon synapses  Ribbon synapses are a type of synapse often found in sensory neurons and are of a unique structure that specially equips them to respond dynamically to inputs from electrotonic potentials. They are so named for an organelle they contain, the synaptic ribbon. This organelle can hold thousands of synaptic vesicles close to the presynaptic membrane, enabling neurotransmitter release that can quickly react to a wide range of changes in the membrane potential.

It derives its name from the way in which it is encoded. Method In the rail fence cipher, the plain text is written downwards and diagonally on successive \\"rails\\" of an imaginary fence, then moving up when the bottom rail is reached. When the top rail is reached, the message is written downwards again until the whole plaintext is written out. The message is then read off in rows. For example, if 3 \\"rails\\" and the message 'WE ARE DISCOVERED. FLEE AT ONCE' is used, the cipherer writes out: W . . . E . . . C . . . R . . . L . . . T . . . E . E . R . D . S . O . E . E . F . E . A . O . C . . . A . . . I . . . V . . . D . . . E . . . N . . Then reads off to get the ciphertext: WECRLTEERDSOEEFEAOCAIVDEN Note that this particular example does NOT use spaces separating the words. The decipherer will need to add them based on context. If spaces are shown in the ciphertext, then they must be included in the count of letters to determine the width of the solution grid. Keys can also be used in this cipher e.g. In this example shown above have Key=3 which means there are three rails, or three lines of text. Solution This solution does not work on all Rail Fence Ciphers. Here is another example to see how to actually solve a Rail Fence cipher. We'll use a 3-rail fence to encode a new phrase and include spacing in between the words. Our ciphertext comes out as IA_EZS_ELYLK_UZERLIPL. Note that our ciphertext has a total of 21 units (letters + spaces). This will be important later on as we try to decipher it. To solve the cipher, you must know the height and cycle of the puzzle. The height is simply the number of fence rails used to create it. In this example, we said that 3 fence rails were used, so the height is 3. The height will always be higher than 2 and no more than the number of letters in the ciphertext (in this case 21) or else the phrase will not be properly encoded; the height can thus be discovered by process of elimination if not known. To determine the puzzle width, which will tell us how many total units will be in each row, you must determine the \\"cycle\\" of letters. A \\"cycle\\" of letters runs from the top row, down through each subsequent row, and then up again, but stopping before reaching the top row again. (The next letter on the top row will actually begin the next cycle.) So a 2-rail puzzle has a \\"cycle\\" of 2 letters; a 3-rail puzzle has a \\"cycle\\" of 4 letters; a 4-rail puzzle has a \\"cycle\\" of 6 letters; etc. (See below.) The math equation for this is: \\"Cycle\\" = ([# of rails] x 2) - 2 (since the top and bottom rows have half as many units per cycle as any middle row(s)). 1 . 1 . 1 . 1 . 1 1 . . . 1 . . . 1 . . . 1 . . . 1 1 . . . . . 1 . . . . . 1 . . . . . 1 . . . . . 1 . 2 . 2 . 2 . 2 . . 2 . 4 . 2 . 4 . 2 . 4 . 2 . 4 . . 2 . . . 6 . 2 . . . 6 . 2 . . . 6 . 2 . . . 6 . . . 3 . . . 3 . . . 3 . . . 3 . . . . 3 . 5 . . . 3 . 5 . . . 3 . 5 . . . 3 . 5 . . . . . 4 . . . . . 4 . . . . . 4 . . . . . 4 . . . Our 3-rail fence example has a \\"cycle\\" of 4 units. So divide the total units (letters + spaces) by the cycle number and round down to the next whole number. There are 21 units in the example, so our \\"base puzzle width\\" is 5 (21 / 4 = 5.25, which rounds down to 5). It is important to realize that there are 5 \\"full cycles\\" plus a \\"partial cycle\\" of 1 more letter (5 x 4 = 20 and 20 + 1 = 21 units). Therefore, the top row has 6 units in it (5 \\"full cycles\\" + the 1 extra letter that is starting off the 6th cycle all by itself). The middle row has 10 units (5 \\"full cycles\\" x 2 units for each cycle). The bottom row has 5 units (5 \\"full cycles\\" x 1 unit for each cycle since it is the bottom-most row). Take the first 6 units from our ciphertext and write them across the top row, leaving much space between the units: [IA_EZS]_ELYLK_UZERLIPL. I . . . A . . . _ . . . E . . . Z . . . S The middle row takes the next 10 units and adds 1 unit just after and 1 unit just before each unit in the top row: IA_EZS[_ELYLK_UZE]RLIPL. I . . . A . . . _ . . . E . . . Z . . . S . _ . E . L . Y . L . K . _ . U . Z . E . The bottom row gets the final 5 units written below and in between the pairs of units in the middle row: IA_EZS_ELYLK_UZE[RLIPL]. I . . . A . . . _ . . . E . . . Z . . . S . _ . E . L . Y . L . K . _ . U . Z . E . . . R . . . L . . . I . . . P . . . L . . Now just follow the down-up-down-up pattern to determine the original message: I_REALLY_LIKE_PUZZLES! Problems with the rail fence cipher The rail fence cipher is not very strong; the number of practical keys (the number of rails) is small enough that a cryptanalyst can try them all by hand. Zigzag cipher The term zigzag cipher may refer to the rail fence cipher as described above. However, it may also refer to a different type of cipher system that looks like a zigzag line going from the top of the page to the bottom. As described in Fletcher Pratt's Secret and Urgent, it is \\"written by ruling a sheet of paper in vertical columns, with a letter at the head of each column. A dot is made for each letter of the message in the proper column, reading from top to bottom of the sheet. The letters at the head of the columns are then cut off, the ruling erased and the message of dots sent along to the recipient, who, knowing the width of the columns and the arrangement of the letters at the top, reconstitutes the diagram and reads what it has to say.\\" See also * Transposition cipher * Scytale References * Helen Fouch√© Gaines, Cryptanalysis, a study of ciphers and their solution, Dover, 1956, External links * American Cryptogram Association - Railfence * (archive) * The Railfence Cipher * Web app for encoding and decoding the rail fence cipher Category:Classical ciphers ","title":"Rail fence cipher"},{"id":"1267454","title":"Webster Vienna Private University"},{"id":"1267455","text":"Obrecht is a patronymic surname.

In 1903, the Kennel Club combined four separate toy spaniel breeds under this single title. The other varieties merged into this breed were the Blenheim, Ruby and Prince Charles Spaniels, each of which contributed one of the four colours available in the breed. Thought to have originated in East Asia, toy spaniels were first seen in Europe during the 16th century. They were made famous by their association with King Charles II of Great Britain and Ireland and have been linked with British royalty since the time of Queen Mary I. Members of the breed were owned by Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia. The King Charles Spaniel and the other types of toy spaniels were crossbred with the Pug in the early 19th century to reduce the size of the nose, as was the style of the day. The 20th century saw attempts to restore lines of King Charles Spaniels to the breed of Charles II's time. These included the unsuccessful Toy Trawler Spaniel and the now popular Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. The Cavalier is slightly larger, with a flat head and a longer nose, while the King Charles is smaller, with a domed head and a flat face. Historically the breeds that were merged into the King Charles Spaniel were used for hunting; due to their stature they were not well suited. They have kept their hunting instincts, but do not exhibit high energy and are better suited to being lapdogs. The modern breed is prone to several health problems, including cardiac conditions and a range of eye problems.  History  Portrait of Queen Mary I and King Philip of England by alt=A painting in mostly black, yellow and red of a man and a woman in 16th century clothing sitting. There are two small mostly white dogs at the feet of the couple. It is thought that the toy spaniels that eventually became the King Charles Spaniel originated in East Asia, primarily Japan. They may share a common ancestry with the Pekingese and Japanese Chin. Toy spaniels were given as gifts to European royalty. The red and white variety of toy spaniel was first seen in paintings by Titian, including the Venus of Urbino (1538), where a small dog is used as a symbol of female seductiveness. Further paintings featuring these toy spaniels were created by Palma Vecchio and Paolo Veronese during the 16th century. These dogs already had high domed heads with short noses, although the muzzles were more pointed than they are today. These Italian toy spaniels may have been crossed with local small dogs such as the Maltese and also with imported Chinese dogs. The Papillon is the continental descendant of similar toy-sized spaniels. The earliest recorded appearance of a toy spaniel in England was in a painting of Queen Mary I and King Philip. Mary, Queen of Scots, was also fond of small toy dogs, including spaniels, showing the fondness of the British royalty for these types of dogs before Charles II.Lytton (1911): p. 38 King Henry III of France owned a number of small spaniels, which were called Damarets. Although one of the translations of John Caius' 1570 Latin work De Canibus Britannicis talks of \\"a new type of Spaniel brought out of France, rare, strange, and hard to get\\",Lytton (1911): p. 16 this was an addition in a later translation, and was not in the original text. Caius did discuss the \\"Spainel-gentle, or Comforter\\" though, which he classified as a delicate thoroughbred. This spaniel was thought to originate from Malta and was sought out only as a lapdog for \\"daintie dames\\". Captain John Saris may have brought back examples of toy spaniels from his voyage to Japan in 1613,Lytton (1911): p. 94 a theory proposed by Commodore Matthew C. Perry during his expeditions to Japan on behalf of the United States in the mid-19th century. He noted that dogs were a common gift and thought that the earlier voyage of Captain Saris introduced a Japanese type of spaniel into England. =17th century and Charles II= Five children of King Charles I of England (1637) by Anthony van Dyck, featuring a spaniel of the era at the bottom right In the 17th century, toy spaniels began to feature in paintings by Dutch artists such as Caspar Netscher and Peter Paul Rubens. Spanish artists, including Juan de Vald√©s Leal and Diego Vel√°zquez, also depicted them; in the Spanish works, the dogs were tricolour, black and white or entirely white. French naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon would later describe these types of dogs as crosses between spaniels and Pugs.Lytton (1911): p. 15 Charles II of England was very fond of the toy spaniel, which is why the dogs now carry his name,Shaw (1881): p. 162 although there is no evidence that the modern breeds are descended from his particular dogs. He is credited with causing an increase in popularity of the breed during this period. Samuel Pepys' diary describes how the spaniels were allowed to roam anywhere in Whitehall Palace, including during state occasions. In an entry dated 1 September 1666, describing a council meeting, Pepys wrote, \\"All I observed there was the silliness of the King, playing with his dog all the while and not minding the business.\\"Lytton (1911): p. 52 Charles' sister Princess Henrietta was painted by Pierre Mignard holding a small red and white toy-sized spaniel.Lytton (1911): p. 17 Judith Blunt-Lytton, 16th Baroness Wentworth, writing in her 1911 work Toy Dogs and Their Ancestors, theorised that after Henrietta's death at the age of 26 in 1670, Charles took her dogs for himself. =After Charles II= Portrait of a King Charles Spaniel, by Jean-Baptiste Huet 1778 Toy spaniels continued to be popular in the British court during the reign of King James II, through that of Queen Anne. Popular types included those of the white and red variety.Walsh (1876): p. 667 Following the Glorious Revolution in 1688 and the reign of King William III and Queen Mary II, the Pug was introduced into Britain which would eventually lead to drastic physical changes to the King Charles Spaniel.Moffat (2006): p. 19 Comparisons between needlework pictures of English toy spaniels and the continental variety show that changes had already begun to take place in the English types by 1736, with a shorter nose being featured and the breed overall moving away from the one seen in earlier works by Anthony van Dyck during the 17th century.Lytton (1911): p. 19 English toy spaniels remained popular enough during the 18th century to be featured frequently in literature and in art. On Rover, a Lady's Spaniel, Jonathan Swift's satire of Ambrose Philips's poem to the daughter of the Lord Lieutenant, describes the features of an English toy, specifying a \\"forehead large and high\\" among other physical characteristics of the breeds. Toy spaniels and Pugs were featured in both group portraits and satirical works by William Hogarth. Toy spaniels were still popular with the upper classes as ladies' dogs, despite the introduction of the Pug; both Thomas Gainsborough's portrait of Queen Charlotte from 1781 and George Romney's 1782 Lady Hamilton as Nature feature toy spaniels with their mistresses. The toy spaniels of this century weighed as little as , although they were thought to be the dog breed most prone to becoming overweight, or \\"fattened\\". =19th century and the Blenheim Spaniel= alt=A black and white drawing of a group of several similar looking small spaniels with different markings. The varieties of toy spaniel were occasionally used in hunting, as the Sportsman's Repository reported in 1830 of the Blenheim Spaniel: \\"Twenty years ago, His Grace the Duke of Marlborough was reputed to possess the smallest and best breed of cockers in Britain; they were invariably red‚Äìand‚Äìwhite, with very long ears, short noses, and black eyes.\\"Shaw (1881): p. 163 During this period, the term \\"cocker\\" was not used to describe a Cocker Spaniel, but rather a type of small spaniel used to hunt woodcock. The Duke's residence, Blenheim Palace, gave its name to the Blenheim Spaniel. The Sportsman's Repository explains that toy spaniels are able to hunt, albeit not for a full day or in difficult terrain: \\"The very delicate and small, or 'carpet spaniels,' have exquisite nose, and will hunt truly and pleasantly, but are neither fit for a long day or thorny covert.\\"Shaw (1881): p. 164 This idea was supported by Vero Shaw in his 1881 work The Illustrated Book of the Dog, and by Thomas Brown in 1829 who wrote, \\"He is seldom used for field‚Äìsports, from his diminutive size, being easily tired, and is too short in the legs to get through swampy ground.\\"Brown (1829): p. 295 During the 19th century, the Maltese was still considered to be a type of spaniel, and thought to be the parent breed of toy spaniels, including both the King Charles and Blenheim varieties. The breeds of toy spaniel often rivalled the Pug in popularity as lapdogs for ladies. The disadvantage of the breeds of toy spaniel was that their long coats required constant grooming. By 1830, the toy spaniel had changed somewhat from the dogs of Charles II's day. William Youatt in his 1845 study, The Dog, was not enamoured of the changes: \\"The King Charles's breed of the present day is materially altered for the worse. The muzzle is almost as short, and the forehead as ugly and prominent as the veriest bull-dog. The eye is increased to double its former size, and has an expression of stupidity with which the character of the dog too accurately corresponds.\\" Youatt did concede that the breed's long ears, coat and colouring were attractive.Youatt (1852): p. 78 Due to the fashion of the period, the toy spaniels were crossed with Pugs to reduce the size of their noses and then selectively bred to reduce it further. By doing this, the dog's sense of smell was impaired, and according to 19th century writers, this caused the varieties of toy spaniel to be removed from participation in field sports. Blunt-Lytton proposed that the red and white Blenheim Spaniels always had the shorter nose now seen in the modern King Charles.Lytton (1911): p. 14 A painting of a King Charles Spaniel by alt=A painting of a small red and white spaniel with long ears From the 16th century, it was the fashion for ladies to carry small toy-sized spaniels as they travelled around town. These dogs were called \\"Comforters\\" and given the species biological classification of Canis consolator by 19th-century dog writers. By the 1830s, this practice was no longer in vogue, and these types of spaniels were becoming rarer.Brown (1829): p. 301 \\"Comforter\\" was given as a generic term to lapdogs, including the Maltese, the English Toy and Continental Toy Spaniels, the latter of which was similar to the modern Phal√®ne. It was once believed that the dogs possessed some power of healing: in 1607 Edward Topsell repeated Caius' observation that \\"these little dogs are good to asswage the sickness of stomach, being oftentimes thereunto applied as a plaister preservative, or bourne in the bosum of the diseased and weak person, which effect is performed by their moderate heat.\\"Brown (1829): p. 302 By the 1840s, \\"Comforter\\" had dropped out of use, and the breed had returned to being called Toy Spaniels.Lytton (1911): p. 36 The first written occurrence of a ruby coloured toy spaniel was a dog named Dandy, owned by a Mr Garwood in 1875.Lytton (1911): p. 40 The dogs continued to be popular with royalty. In 1896, Otto von Bismarck purchased a King Charles Spaniel from an American kennel for $1,000. The dog weighed less than , and had been disqualified from the Westminster Kennel Club the previous year on account of its weight. The average price was lower than that paid by Bismarck. In 1899, the price ranged between $50 and $200 for a King Charles or Blenheim,Diehl (1899): p. 39 with the Ruby and Prince Charles Spaniel ranging between $50 and $150.Diehl (1899): p. 41Diehl (1899): p. 42 Anne Bront√´'s \\"Flossy,\\" given to her by the Robinson children when she left her governorship of them, was a King Charles Spaniel. =Conformation showing and the 20th century= alt=A black and white photograph of a small spaniel sitting, it faces right In 1903, the Kennel Club attempted to amalgamate the King James (black and tan), Prince Charles (tricolour), Blenheim and Ruby spaniels into a single breed called the Toy Spaniel. The Toy Spaniel Club, which oversaw those separate breeds, strongly objected, and the argument was only resolved following the intervention of King Edward VII, who made it clear that he preferred the name \\"King Charles Spaniel\\". In 1904, the American Kennel Club followed suit, combining the four breeds into a single breed known as the English Toy Spaniel. The Japanese Spaniel was also considered a type of toy spaniel,Diehl (1899): p. 38 but was not merged into the new breed and was recognised as a breed in its own right. Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia owned a King Charles Spaniel at the time of the shooting of the Romanov family on 17 July 1918. Eight days later, Nicholas Sokolov of the White Forces found a clearing where he believed the bodies of the Romanov family had been burnt, and discovered the corpse of a King Charles Spaniel at the site. In 1920s, the Duchess of Marlborough bred so many King Charles Spaniels at Blenheim Palace that her husband moved out and later evicted the Duchess herself. Blunt-Lytton documented her attempts in the early 20th century to re-breed the 18th-century type of King Charles Spaniel as seen in the portraits of King Charles II.Lytton (1911): p. 80 She used the Toy Trawler Spaniel, a curly haired, mostly black, small to medium- sized spaniel, and cross-bred these dogs with a variety of other breeds, including Blenheim Spaniels and Cocker Spaniels, in unsuccessful attempts to reproduce the earlier style. alt=A black and white photographic headshot of a small spaniel with a stubby nose and mostly dark markings. The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel originated from a competition held by American Roswell Eldridge in 1926. He offered a prize fund for the best male and female dogs of \\"Blenheim Spaniels of the old type, as shown in pictures of Charles II of England's time, long face, no stop, flat skull, not inclined to be domed, with spot in centre of skull.\\"Coile (2008): p. 9 Breeders entered what they considered to be sub-par King Charles Spaniels. Although Eldridge did not live to see the new breed created, several breeders banded together and created the first breed club for the new Cavalier King Charles Spaniel in 1928, with the Kennel Club initially listing the new breed as \\"King Charles Spaniels, Cavalier type\\". In 1945, the Kennel Club recognised the new breed in its own right. The American Kennel Club did not recognise the Cavalier until 1997.Moffat (2006): p. 23 Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon, continued the connection between royalty and the King Charles Spaniel, attending Princess Anne's tenth birthday party with her dog Rolly in 1960. Elizabeth II has also owned King Charles Spaniels in addition to the dogs most frequently associated with her, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi. alt=A black and white photo of four small spaniels sitting facing the camera. They each have similar markings. In 2008, the BBC documentary Pedigree Dogs Exposed was critical of the breeding of a variety of pedigree breeds including the King Charles Spaniel. The show highlighted issues involving syringomyelia in both the King Charles and Cavalier breeds. Mark Evans, the chief veterinary advisor for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), said, \\"Dog shows using current breed standards as the main judging criteria actively encourage both the intentional breeding of deformed and disabled dogs and the inbreeding of closely related animals\\"; this opinion was seconded by the Scottish SPCA. Following the programme, the RSPCA ended its sponsorship of the annual Crufts dog show, and the BBC declined to broadcast the event. The King Charles Spaniel is less popular than the Cavalier in both the UK and the US. In 2010, the Cavalier was the 23rd most popular breed, according to registration figures collected by the American Kennel Club, while the English Toy Spaniel was the 126th. In the UK, according to the Kennel Club, the Cavalier is the most popular breed in the Toy Group, with 8,154 puppies registered in 2010, compared to 199 registrations for King Charles Spaniels. Due to the low number of registrations, the King Charles was identified as a Vulnerable Native Breed by the Kennel Club in 2003 in an effort to help promote the breed.  Description  The King Charles has large dark eyes, a short nose, a high domed head and a line of black skin around the mouth. On average, it stands at the withers, with a small but compact body. The breed has a traditionally docked tail. It has the long pendulous ears typical of a spaniel and its coat comes in four varieties, trait it shares with its offshoot, the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. alt=A small black and white spaniel lies on its front, facing left. The four sets of markings reflect the four former breeds from which the modern breed was derived. Black and tan markings are known as \\"King Charles\\", while \\"Prince Charles\\" is tricoloured, \\"Blenheim\\" is red and white, and \\"Ruby\\" is a single-coloured solid rich red. The \\"King Charles\\" black and tan markings typically consist of a black coat with mahogany/tan markings on the face, legs and chest and under the tail. The tricoloured \\"Prince Charles\\" is mostly white with black patches and mahogany/tan markings in similar locations to the \\"King Charles\\". The \\"Blenheim\\" has a white coat with red patches, and should have a distinctive red spot in the center of the skull. King Charles Spaniels are often mistaken for Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. There are several significant differences between the two breeds, the principal being the size. While the Cavalier weighs on average between ,Palika (2007): p. 190 the King Charles is smaller at .Palika (2007): pp. 232‚Äì233 In addition, their facial features, while similar, are distinguishable: the Cavalier's ears are set higher and its skull is flat, while the King Charles' is domed. Finally, the muzzle length of the King Charles tends to be shorter than the typical muzzle on a Cavalier. The American Kennel Club has two classes, English Toy Spaniel (B/PC) (Blenheim and Prince Charles) and English Toy Spaniel (R/KC), while in the UK, the Kennel Club places the breed in a single class. Under the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale groups, the King Charles is placed in the English Toy Spaniel section within the Companion and Toy Dog Group, along with the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.  Temperament  A toy Spaniel, a dwarf Spitz and a Maltese next to a basket (1855) by . The King Charles is a friendly breed, to the extent that it is not typically as suitable as a watchdog as some breeds, though it may still bark to warn its owners of an approaching visitor. It is not a high energy breed, and enjoys the company of family members, being primarily a lapdog. Although able to bond well with children and tolerant of them, it will not accept rough handling. It prefers not to be left alone for long periods. Known as one of the quietest toy breeds, it is suitable for apartment living. The breed can tolerate other pets well, although the King Charles still has the hunting instincts of its ancestors and may not always be friendly towards smaller animals. It is intelligent enough to be used for obedience work and, due to its stable temperament, it can be a successful therapy dog for hospitals and nursing homes. Health A natural bobtail can be found in some members of the breed, which is not a mutation of the T-box gene, and so is allowed under conformation show rules. Health-related research on the breed has been limited, with no major studies conducted in Britain. However, it has been included in studies outside the UK, including by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) in the United States. The King Charles Spaniel has a number of eye and respiratory system disorders common to brachycephalic dogs, and endocrine and metabolic diseases common to small breeds, as well as specific breed-associated health conditions. The average lifespan is 10 to 12 years, \\"n=22, median=10.1\\" \\"n=26, median=12.0, IQR=10.0-14.2\\" and the breed should be able to reproduce naturally. =Eye and heart conditions= The eye problems associated with the King Charles Spaniel include cataracts, corneal dystrophy, distichia, entropion, microphthalmia, optic disc drusen, and keratitis. Compared to other breeds, the King Charles Spaniel has an increased risk of distichia (where extra eyelashes or hairs cause irritation to the eye). Inheritance is suspected in the other conditions, with ages of onset ranging from six months for cataracts to two to five years for corneal dystrophy. Heart conditions related to the King Charles Spaniel include mitral valve disease, in which the mitral valve degrades, causing blood to flow backwards through the chambers of the heart and eventually leading to congestive heart failure. Patent ductus arteriosus, where blood is channelled back from the heart into the lungs, is also seen and can lead to heart failure. Both of these conditions present with similar symptoms and are inheritable. The OFA conducted a survey on cardiac disease, where of 105 breeds, the King Charles Spaniel was found to be 7th worst, with 2.1% of 189 dogs affected. =Other common issues= Being a brachycephalic breed, King Charles Spaniels can be sensitive to anesthesia. This is because in brachycephalic dogs, there is additional tissue in the throat directly behind the mouth and nasal cavity, known as the pharynx, and anesthesia acts as a muscle relaxant causing this tissue to obstruct the dogs' narrow airways. These narrow airways can decrease the dogs' ability to exercise properly and increase their susceptibility to heat stroke. Other congenital and hereditary disorders found in the King Charles Spaniel are hanging tongue, where a neurological defect prevents the tongue from retracting into the mouth; diabetes mellitus, which may be associated with cataracts; cleft palate and umbilical hernia. The English Toy Spaniel Club of America recommends that umbilical hernias be corrected only if other surgery is required, due to the risk of surgery in brachycephalic breeds. In another study conducted by the OFA, the King Charles Spaniel was the 38th worst of 99 breeds for patella luxation; of 75 animals tested, 4% were found to have the ailment. However, surveys conducted by the Finnish breed club between 1988 and 2007 found that the occurrences were higher in some years, ranging from 5.3% to 50%. There are several breed traits which may cause concern as health issues. They include skull issues such as an open fontanelle, where in young dogs there is a soft spot in the skull; it is common in dogs under a year old. A complication from that condition is hydrocephalus, also known as water on the brain. This condition may cause neurological symptoms that require the dog to be euthanised. Fused toes, where two or more of the dog's toes are fused together, may seem to be a health issue but this breed trait is not a cause for concern.  Urban myth  An urban legend claims that Charles II issued a special decree granting King Charles Spaniels permission to enter any establishment in the UK, overriding \\"no dog except guide dogs\\" rules. A variant of this myth relates specifically to the Houses of Parliament. This myth is sometimes instead applied to the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. The UK Parliament website states: \\"Contrary to popular rumour, there is no Act of Parliament referring to King Charles spaniels being allowed anywhere in the Palace of Westminster. We are often asked this question and have thoroughly researched it.\\" Similarly, there is no proof of any such law covering the wider UK. A spokesman for the Kennel Club said: \\"This law has been quoted from time to time. It is alleged in books that King Charles made this decree but our research hasn't tracked it down.\\"  See also  * Cavalier King Charles Spaniel * Toy dog  References  ;Specific ;General    External links * Category:Companion dogs Category:Dog breeds originating in England Category:FCI breeds Category:Rare dog breeds Category:Spaniels ","title":"King Charles Spaniel"},{"id":"1267457","text":"Loch of Skene is a large lowland, freshwater loch in Aberdeenshire, Scotland.

He proposed that the element be given the name panchromium, or later, erythronium, but his discovery was not credited at the time, and his names were not used. Education Andr√©s del R√≠o studied analytical chemistry and metallurgy in Spain, where he was born. He received his bachelor's degree from the University of Alcal√° de Henares in 1780 at the age of fifteen. The government gave him a scholarship to enter the Royal Academy of Mines in Almad√©n, Spain, as of June 1782. He showed great aptitude. In 1783 he was given a travel grant by the Spanish Ministry of Mines. He used it to study in Paris, with the chemist Jean Darcet at the Coll√®ge de France. Del R√≠o continued his studies at the Mining Academy in Freiberg, Germany, under the direction of Abraham Gottlob Werner in 1789. In Freiberg he got to know Baron Alexander von Humboldt. Del R√≠o went on to study at the Austrian Imperial- Royal Mining Academy at Schemnitz, Hungary, with Anton von Rupprecht, as well as in England. Del Rio returned to Paris in 1791 where he was a colleague (asociados) of Antoine Lavoisier, who is considered the founder of modern chemistry, and Abb√© Ren√© Just Ha√ºy, who is considered the founder of crystallography. As a result of the French Revolution, a warrant for Lavoisier's arrest was issued on 4 November 1793. Lavoisier was executed on the guillotine on 8 May 1794. After Lavoisier's arrest, Del R√≠o escaped to England. Mining in New Spain In 1792, the Real Seminario de Miner√≠a (College of Mines) was founded in New Spain by a decree of King Charles III of Spain, with the object of reforming the study of mining and metallurgy in the colony. The institution was initially headed by Fausto Elh√∫yar (1755‚Äì1833), the discoverer of tungsten. In 1793, Elh√∫yar offered Del R√≠o a position as chair at the newly organized college. Del Rio refused the chair of chemistry, but accepted that of mineralogy. Note: Del Rio cannot have traveled on the San Pedro de Alcantara as it sank in 1786. Del R√≠o arrived at the port of Veracruz on 20 October 1794, on the ship San Francisco de Alc√°ntara out of C√°diz. Once in his new position, del R√≠o dedicated himself to teaching and scientific investigation. On 27 April 1795 he opened the first course in mineralogy ever presented in New Spain. He made important studies of minerals and developed innovative methods in mining. He also wrote the first textbook of mineralogy to be published anywhere in America, Elementos de Orictognos√≠a, and the first in Spanish rather than German or English. Volume I appeared in 1795, and volume II in 1805. Santiago Ram√≠rez, his student and later his biographer, described it as \\"a monumental work, which... will be an object of veneration and consultation\\". \\"Monumental trabajo objeto de veneraci√≥n y consulta por todos los mineralogistas‚Ä¶‚Äù German naturalist, Alexander von Humboldt, making a survey of resources in Spanish-held colonies for Spain, reported favorably that it was in Mexico where the best work of mineralogy in Spanish had been published, the Elementos de Orictognosia of Se√±or Del Rio. Humboldt spent the period from March 1803 to March 1804 in Mexico City, renewing his friendship with del Rio and actively participating in the investigations of the College of Mining. He organized excursions to Chapultepec, to the basaltic zone of Pedregal de San √Ångel, the lava fields of the Xitle volcano, and to the hot springs of Pe√±√≥n de los Ba√±os, a rocky outcrop close to the modern Mexico City International Airport, accumulating data and samples of minerals and rocks that were then submitted to chemical tests for identification. In 1820 del R√≠o was named a deputy to the Spanish Cortes. He was a liberal who argued for the independence of New Spain. He was in Madrid when Mexico gained its independence. Invited to remain in Spain, he nevertheless returned to Mexico (in 1821), which he considered his homeland. In 1829, after the turbulent period of war with Spain, the government of independent Mexico expelled the Spaniards resident in the country, with some notable exceptions. Del R√≠o was one of the exceptions. The expulsion had a major impact on the work of the College of Mining. The director, Fausto Elh√∫yar, was forced to resign and leave the country. Indignant over the expulsion of his colleagues, del R√≠o showed solidarity by himself entering voluntary exile in Philadelphia for four years. There he was highly honored. He took part in the scientific activities of the American Philosophical Society and was elected president of the Geological Society of Philadelphia. John Hurtel of Philadelphia published a new edition of del Rio's book in 1832. Del Rio returned to Mexico in 1834 and again occupied the chair of mineralogy at the college. He was also given the chair of geology. The discovery of vanadium Element 23 on the periodic table. Vanadium is not found in the native state, but is present in minerals such as vanadinite, Pb5(VO4)3Cl. In 1801, while examining mineral samples sent to him by the Pur√≠sima del Cardenal mine in Zimap√°n in the State of Hidalgo, del R√≠o arrived at the conclusion that he had found a new metallic element. He prepared various compounds of the element, and observing their diverse colors, he named the element panchromium (Greek: œÄŒ±Œ≥œáœÅœéŒºŒπŒø \\"all colors\\"). Later, on observing that the compounds changed color to red on heating, he substituted the name erythronium (Greek: ŒµœÅœÖŒ∏œÅœåœÇ \\"red\\"). The following year he gave samples containing the new element to Alexander von Humboldt, who sent them on to Hippolyte Victor Collet-Descotils in Par√≠s for his analysis. Collet- Descotils's analysis found (mistakenly) that the samples contained only chromium. Humboldt, in turn, rejected del R√≠o's claim of the discovery of a new element, and del R√≠o himself concluded his discovery had been an error. In 1830, 27 years after its initial discovery, Professor Nils Gabriel Sefstr√∂m of Sweden rediscovered the element in a sample of iron of Taberg. He gave it its current name, vanadium, in honor of the Scandinavian goddess of love and beauty, Vanadis. In the same year, Friedrich W√∂hler, the German chemist who had synthesized urea, analyzed some of del R√≠o's samples of brown lead ore of Zimap√°n and demonstrated that Sefstr√∂m's vanadium and del Rio's erythronium were the same. In 1831 the U.S. geologist George William Featherstonhaugh proposed without success that the element should be named rionium, in honor of its original discoverer. An extensive analysis of the publication history of papers relating to the discovery of the element suggests that the intervention of J. J. Berzelius on behalf of his students Sefstr√∂m and W√∂hler, was highly instrumental in influencing the element's attribution and naming, reflecting patterns of scientific prestige and control of discourse in the first half of the nineteenth century. In 1867 the English chemist Henry Enfield Roscoe isolated the pure metal for the first time. He used hydrogen to get rid of the chloride around the pure vanadium. Later life In 1805 del R√≠o established an ironworks at Coalcom√°n. After overcoming numerous obstacles, he produced the first iron in Mexico, on 29 April 1807. Four years later, during the Mexican War of Independence, the royalists destroyed the ironworks. The iron he produced was superior to the celebrated imported iron from Biscay (Vizcaya), Spain. Del Rio was bitter about Humboldt's mistake in not confirming the discovery of vanadium, and strongly reproached him. He continued to teach at the College of Mines until his death, a course that \\"could well have been taught at the Polytechnic school in Paris\\", according to Michel Chevalier, who visited del R√≠o shortly before the latter's death. Death and recognition Palacio de Mineria, Mexico City Andr√©s Manuel del R√≠o died at 84 in 1849, after a long and productive academic career. His work and his liberal politics were important to the building of an independent Mexican nation. He was the founding professor of mineralogy at the College of Mines, which laid the base for the current Institute of Geology of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). He was a member of the Spanish Royal Academy of Sciences in Madrid, the Wernerian Natural History Society of Edinburgh, the Royal Academy of Sciences of France, the Economic Society of Leipzig, the Linnean Society of Leipzig, the Royal Academy of Saxony and the Philosophical Society of Philadelphia. He was also president of the Geological Society of Philadelphia and the Lyceum of Natural History of New York. A sample of vanadium. His extensive scientific work, besides the first identification of vanadium, included the discovery and description of various minerals and the invention of methods of extraction of minerals for use in the mining industry. After his death, the important mining district that includes Batopilas in Chihuahua was named in his honor. The Chemical Society of Mexico instituted the prestigious National Chemistry Prize \\"Andr√©s Manuel Del R√≠o\\" in 1964, with the object of giving public recognition to the work done by chemical professionals who have made extraordinary contributions to raise the level and prestige of the profession. It is awarded with a medal containing the likeness of del R√≠o and a commemorative plaque. Andr√©s Manuel Del R√≠o, Luis E. Miramontes, inventor of the first oral contraceptive, and Mario J. Molina, winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1995, are the three Mexican chemists of outstanding world significance. Miramontes won the \\"Andr√©s Manuel Del R√≠o\\" Prize in 1986.

Etymology  The name Lida is derived from the name of the River Lidzeya. Its origin is associated with the Lithuanian name Lyda - Lydimas, meaning to fuse, to cast (denoting forest clearing). Names in other languages are spelled as and .  History  = Early history, Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth = 19th-century view of the Lida Castle There are passing mentions of Lida in chronicles from 1180. Until the early 14th century, the settlement at Lida was a wooden fortress in Lithuania proper. In 1323, the Grand Duke of Lithuania Gediminas built a brick fortress there. The generally considered founding year of Lida is 1380. The fortress withstood Crusader attacks from Prussia in 1392 and 1394 but was burned to the ground in 1710. Following the death of Gediminas, when Lithuania was divided into principalities, Lida became the capital of one of them, the seat of Algirdas. Lida was in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. After the Union of Krewo (1385), when the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Union was established, and the subsequent Christianization of Lithuania, the Catholic parish was established in the former Lithuanian pagan lands, and a church, whose ruins still exist, was built by King W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço, who visited Lida two times, in 1415 and 1422. In the 15th century, the town became a centre of production by craftsmen and trade. Lida was connected with Vilnius, Navahrudak and Minsk. The town had a market square and four streets: Wile≈Ñska, Zamkowa, Kamie≈Ñska and Krivaya.https://sztetl.org.pl/pl/miejscowosci/l/1071-lida/104-teksty- kultury/17372-topografia-lidy In 1506, a Sejm was held in Lida, convened by King Aleksander Jagiellon and the Polish-Lithuanian army gathered here before the Battle of Kletsk, in which it defeated the invading Tatars. 18th-century city seal of Lida In 1588, Lida became the seat of Lida District in Vilnius Voivodeship. Polish King Sigismund III Vasa granted Lida Magdeburg town rights in 1590, which were later confirmed in Warsaw by Kings W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV Vasa in 1640 and Michael Korybut Wi≈õniowiecki in 1670 and by the Polish Sejm in 1776. They let Lida hold two annual fairs of little import to the local economy. It was a royal city.–í—è–ª—ñ–∫—ñ –≥—ñ—Å—Ç–∞—Ä—ã—á–Ω—ã –∞—Ç–ª–∞—Å –ë–µ–ª–∞—Ä—É—Å—ñ –¢.2, Minsk 2013, p. 88 The population was between 2000 and 5000 people. The second half of the 17th century was a difficult time for Lida. During the Russo-Polish War the city was destroyed by the Cossacks in 1655 and the Russians in 1659. As a result of the war in 1656 famine occurred and in 1657 an epidemic. To revive Lida, King Michael Korybut Wi≈õniowiecki exempted the city from taxes with a privilege of 1676. In 1679 it suffered a fire. In 1702, Lida was plundered by the Swedes. In 1759, a high school was founded in Lida. By 1786, only 514 inhabitants were left in Lida, in 1792, 1243 people lived here. After the Third Partition of Poland in 1795, it was annexed by the Russian Empire as a powiat centre of the Slonim Governorate (1795). = Imperial Russia = COA of Lida in Vilna Governorate Lida was then part of the Lithuania Governorate in 1797 and then Grodno Governorate in 1801. The town was mostly destroyed during the Napoleonic Wars in 1812. In 1817, the population was 1366 people. In 1831, during the November Uprising, a battle was fought nearby between the Polish insurgents commanded by Dezydery Ch≈Çapowski and the Russians. After the uprising, as part of anti-Polish repressions the Piarist church was taken away from Catholics by the Russian administration and transformed into an Orthodox church. It was restored to Catholics after Poland regained independence. In 1842, Lida became the centre of Vilna Governorate. In 1863 and 1873, two beer factories were built in Lida. In 1884, the railway from Vilnius to Lunenets was finished. In 1907, the railway from Molodechno to Mosty was opened. In 1897, the town had 8626 people. After two-year school opened, a parish school with adepartment for girls opened and a Jewish school. In 1899, a hospital opened which consisted of 25 beds. In 1901, a cast-iron plant began to operate. In 1903, a sawmill started operating. At the end of 19th century and the beginning of 20th century, two brick plants were built. In 1904, there were 1000 houses, of which 275 were brick, 14 small enterprises, four hospitals with beds for 115 patients and six elementary schools for 700 pupils. In 1904, the Russian Social Democratic Party was formed near Minsk. During the revolutions of 1905 to 1907, workers' uprisings took place, complete with political slogans. In 1914, there were almost 40 factories. = Interwar Poland = Bird's eye view of Lida in the 1920s During World War I Lida was occupied by German troops. In 1919, the Red Army established Bolshevik power. Polish troops, under General J√≥zef Adam Lasocki, reached the outskirts of Lida in early March 1919. On April 15, they resumed their advance, and on April 17 they captured Lida, a screening operation to the taking of Vilnius. Wile≈Ñska Street in pre-war Poland On 17 July 1920, the Red Army returned, but it was forced to retreat in August after their defeat at Warsaw. On 30 September 1920, Polish and Russian troops fought in and around Lida during the Battle of the Niemen River, as the Soviet 21st Rifle Division tried to assault Polish positions but was repulsed by the 1st Lithuanian- Belarusian Division. The Poles took about 10,000 prisoners from the Soviet 3rd Army. By the Soviet-Lithuanian Treaty of 1920, Lida was ceded by the Soviets to Lithuania, but the treaty was not recognized by Poland. In accordance with 1921 Riga Peace Treaty, the town was awarded to Poland and was a powiat centre in the Nowogr√≥dek Voivodeship. In 1927 were 24 factories in Lida, whose production grew rapidly in 1928. A new rubber goods factory started, employing almost 800 people. Lida was also an important garrison of the Polish Army, with one infantry division and the 5th Corps of the Polish Air Force stationed there. In the 1930s, Lida was extensively expanded, dozens of new streets were built. = World War II and recent history = occupation of Poland In 1939, after the Soviet invasion of Poland, Lida became part of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. In January 1940, Lida became the centre of Lida Raion, in Baranavichy Voblast. From June 1941 to July 1944, it was occupied by German troops, who killed almost 25,149 people. On September 18, 1943, the Jewish Community of Lida was rounded up and taken to Majdanek, where they were murdered. Only about 200 Lida Jews survived the Holocaust. From mid-1944 Lida was occupied by the Soviets again. After the war, in 1945, in accordance to the Potsdam Agreement it was taken from Poland and annexed by the Soviet Union. Administratively, Lida became part of Grodno Region. From the Cold War to 1993, Lida was home to the 1st Guards Bomber Aviation Division of the Soviet Air Force.  Jewish Community  Jews first settled in Lida in the middle of the 16th century, and permission to construct a synagogue was granted by King Stefan Batory in 1579. The temple was decimated and rebuilt with the permission of King Wladyslaw Vasa in 1630. By 1817, the Jewish Community numbered 567, nearly three-quarters of the total population of the city. Lida had a particularly-sightly brick synagogue. Old photographs can be found.http://www.eilatgordinlevitan.com/lida/lida_pix/front/042208_89_b.gif Memorial stone During the First World War, the Germans captured Lida on 26 September 1915, and both Jews and Gentiles were forced into labour. Soon after the German Occupation ceased in winter 1918, Bolsheviks entered the city and created a strong sense of the Revolution. In 17 April 1919, Polish soldiers entered Lida and committed a pogrom, killing 39 Jews. Lida was captured by the Red Army in 17 July 1920 but was retaken by Polish troops in 29 September 1920. After the Peace of Riga, it was passed to Poland and became powiat (county) centre in Nowogr√≥dek Voivodeship. The interwar period was a short period of economic growth for the Jewish community. All aspects flourished, and there were 12 fully functioning synagogues. In 1931, the Jewish population grew to 6,335, and at the dawn of the Holocaust, refugees increased the number to nearly 8,500. In the fall of 1939, the Red Army moved in and annexed Lida to the Baranavichy Voblast of Byelorussian SSR, part of the Soviet Union on 19 September 1939. Once again, the Jews were oppressed, and all cultural aspects of the community were diminished. The Soviets imprisoned surrounding Jews in Lida. On 27 June 1941, the Germans severely damaged the city, and by December, a ghetto was created on the suburbs of Lida in which several families ended up crowding into a single home. On May 7, 1942, the ghetto was sealed, and the next day, nearly 6,000 were taken to a military firing range, where they were shot and piled in ready-made grave pits. About 1,500 educated Jews remained in the ghetto, and the population was added to by incoming refugees. A few groups secretly escaped the city and hid in the forests until the city was liberated on 9 July 1944, but the rest of the community was murdered on September 18, 1943. It was passed to the new Grodno Voblast in 1944.  Monuments and attractions  * Lida Castle was built by the order of the Grand Duke of Lithuania Gediminas for protection against assaults by the Teutonic Knights. The stone foundations were laid in 1323.lidazayiflama.us Parts of the trapezium-shaped fortress were added on up through the 15th century. In the mid-17th century, an army of 30,000 was sent by Prince Nikita Khovansky of Moscow to destroy it, and in the Great Northern War (1700‚Äì1721), Swedes came and blew up the castle's towers, permanently diminishing its military purpose. It has since been restored, and tourists come to view its crimson walls. * The Roman Catholic Church of the Exaltation of the Cross, a fine example of local late Baroque architecture. * The Piarist Church of St. Joseph in Lida was built in 1794 to 1825. Built in the Late Classicism Style, the round stone church has an attractive dome and front. In 1842, it was destroyed by a fire but was soon rebuilt. It is now an Orthodox Church. * Wooden Church of the Immaculate Conception of Mary * The Catholic Church in Lida was given a new sanctuary in April 2007. The refreshingly-white interior complements the tan exterior. * In spring 2001, the Jewishs of Belarus worked closely with the residents of Lida to erect a memorial commemorating the thousands of Lida Jews that perished in the Holocaust. In autumn 2003 was an unveiling ceremony, involving 400 people. Now, visitors and residents alike can take a visit to this memorial, which properly honors all innocent victims of World War II.

He has since retired the Sixtoo name pursuing other directions in electronic music, with a large genre shift from experimental hip hop to deeper club sounds of various tempos. He has also released music as Speakerbruiser Rob, and Prison Garde. History Sixtoo rose to prominence in the mid 1990s underground hip hop scene initially as half of Halifax, Nova Scotia hip hop duo Sebutones, along with Buck 65. During that time, he worked with Sage Francis, Moka Only, Mr. Dibbs and other members of Anticon. In 2000, Sixtoo moved to Montreal where he signed on with UK based record label Vertical Form. Soon after came the release of Antagonist Survival Kit, a synth-based sample album that showcased both sides of his skills: on the mic and on the sampler. In 2003, Sixtoo signed to Ninja Tune. His debut album on the label, Chewing on Glass & Other Miracle Cures, has won acclaim in the international electronic beats community in 2004. Since silencing the Sixtoo project, he has had a string of visible live P.A. projects including Megasoid along with Hadji Bakara, a former member of Wolf Parade. He has also collaborated with Ango (born Andrew Gordon Macpherson) and Lunice (born Lunice Pierre Fermin) on the electronic music project Nouveau Palais. The trio released Avant Gang in 2012. Sixtoo entirely produced Isaiah Toothtaker's Sea Punk Funk in 2012.

He is the lead vocalist for the punk rock band Biography =Personal life= Buchan was born in Edinburgh, Scotland on 24 July 1957. He served in the British Army as a soldier prior to joining the Exploited.The Exploited +++ Real Punk Rock Since 1980. The-Exploited.net. Retrieved 29 January 2013. He became interested in punk rock in the 1970s after hearing music by bands such as Sex Pistols. Buchan is married to Gena Buchan. =Career= The Exploited are a Scottish punk rock band from the second wave of UK punk, formed in 1978. Originally playing styles such as street punk and oi!, the band played styles such as crossover thrash later on. Formed in Edinburgh by Wattie's older brother Terry, they signed to Secret Records in March 1981 and released their debut EP Army Life. The album Punks Not Dead followed in the same year. Despite many lineup changes, the band continued into the 2000s, and has developed a worldwide following. In 2012, the band began writing material for a new album. =Health= In February 2014, Buchan suffered a heart attack on stage in Lisbon, Portugal. The Exploited had been touring with Hatebreed and Napalm Death. He was admitted to S. Jos√© Hospital in Lisbon after the show and later moved to S. Marta Hospital to recover and undergo heart surgery. The Exploited cancelled the remaining of the Tour Of Chaos 2014 due to Buchan's condition. On 29 June 2014, the Exploited's Facebook page updated on Buchan's condition, saying that after a successful heart operation, the band is practising new material. In an interview with Rock Hard Magazine in May 2016, he said that he had suffered from depression, which was affecting his ability to write new lyrics. Views and beliefs Buchan openly hates politics. He also hates religion. When asked about religion, Buchan said, \\"I fuckin' hate religion. For me everyone's free to believe in something. Just because you believe in some of it, doesn't mean that you‚Ä¶but I can't understand people that care about religion more than anything else. I am like 'What? What the fuck?!?' I just hate religion.\\" Buchan is an anarchist. Buchan has condemned several politicians, including George W. Bush, Margaret Thatcher, and Tony Blair. Buchan said about Thatcher: \\"She was a bit of a cunt, but at least she was honest\\". The Exploited's song \\"Maggie\\" is about Thatcher. In the song \\"Maggie\\" lyrics, Buchan calls Thatcher a \\"cunt\\". Buchan has said that Blair \\"is a total fucking, lying fanny wank.\\" Buchan has criticized George W. Bush for the Iraq war that began in 2003. Buchan said: \\"It's unbelievable, these people have got so much power, and they start all these wars. Everybody sees that, but nobody does anything to stop that.\\" Buchan is pro-Palestine and has condemned Israel's treatment of the Palestinians. In an interview with I Probably Hate Your Band, Buchan expressed his pro-Palestinian views, saying: \\"even with Israel and Palestine, the Palestinian people are like prisoners and the world does nothing about it because America‚Äôs behind them, backing them because they want bases for their airplanes in that area.\\" One of the songs The Exploited has worked on during the 2010s is a song called \\"My TV\\", which Buchan says \\"is about watching the news with Israel bombing Palestine and politicians being greedy cunts.\\" Buchan has also criticized the foreign policy of both the United States and Britain. Buchan said: Feuds and criticism towards other musicians Buchan is known for criticizing other musicians and starting feuds with other musicians. The Exploited's Punks Not Dead album's title is a reaction to anarcho punk contemporaries Crass' song \\"Punk is Dead\\". Buchan has been open about disliking Crass, saying: \\"People listen to bands and believe what they sing about. Crass was just words.\\" He stated \\"they were full of shit. They said they believed in this and that, but bought record companies under other people's names so it couldn't be traced back to them. It was all about money with them.\\" Other than Crass, Buchan has criticized multiple other bands and musicians including Henry Rollins, Jello Biafra, Green Day, Bad Religion, Linkin Park, The Offspring, and Descendents. Buchan has also criticized emo saying \\"Emo's shit! They can stick it up their ass!\\" Buchan accused the punk rock band the Buzzcocks of selling out. Buchan said about the Buzzcocks: \\"They used to be good but they really sold out. A lot of the bands here used to be good until they turned to more pop rock. Like when I was a punk (when I was young), I used to see the Buzzcocks live. It was great.\\" When the Exploited were at Amnesia Rockfest, Buchan, during an interview, criticized the other bands at the music festival, saying: \\"Well, here at Rockfest, you got a lot of bands that define themselves as punk bands but they're shit. They are so pop- oriented that they don't even stand for any values; they do not deserve the status of being defined as punk bands.\\" Buchan has been known for openly disliking former Dead Kennedys member Jello Biafra. The Exploited's song \\"I Hate You\\" is about Jello Biafra. On the album Live at the White House, he introduces the song with an insult to Biafra and claims that he slept with his wife. On the same album, he dedicates the song \\"Wankers\\" to the artist Pushead, who claimed that he was neither paid nor credited for his work with the band, and the song \\"Daily News\\" to Maximumrocknroll. When asked in a documentary why he disliked Biafra, Buchan said that he could not remember. In May 2016, Buchan also criticised Slayer for refusing to allow the Exploited to appear on stage with them after the Exploited had allowed Slayer to cover [collaborating with Ice-T] three of their songs for the Judgment Night soundtrack for only a small payment. Buchan was asked which bands he liked after he criticised several other acts appearing at Amnesia Rockfest. Buchan responded by mentioning Charged GBH, Carcass, No Fun at All, Skinny Puppy, and Ministry. He also said of Slayer: \\"Slayer's okay. I mean, only some of their stuff is okay. I'll restrain myself from saying anything more about them.\\" Buchan said about Real McKenzies: \\"I don't feel any special political bond with them ‚Äì my brother, the drummer of the band, is a lot more conscious of Scottish politics. However, I've played with them a few times; they're total alcoholics. Good people: their gigs are always excitin'.\\" =Feud with Conflict= After the appearance by the Exploited on Top of the Pops to perform Dead Cities in 1981, the hardcore punk band Conflict criticized the decision to appear on the programme with the song \\"Exploitation\\". This began a long-standing feud between the Exploited and Conflict, which divided the punk community and caused occasional clashes between the bands' fans (known as The Barmy Army for the Exploited and the Conflict Crew). =Feud with Green Day= At an awards ceremony for a music magazine, Buchan was presenting an award that was won by Green Day, a band that Buchan hates. Buchan had to present the award to Green Day. Buchan alleged that during the after-party Green Day member Billie Joe Armstrong confronted him and said \\"when you die, I'm going to be standing over your grave, laughing at ya.\\" Buchan said he then responded to Armstrong, saying to Armstrong: \\"I've got something you'll never have, mate. You could have a big record company and loads of money but I've got something you'll never have, and that's respect from the punks. You can not buy that, you have to earn it.\\" The two then had to be separated by onlookers. In March 2020, Buchan responded to the coronavirus pandemic that was forcing bands to cancel or postpone tours. He commented by taking a shot at Green Day saying \\"Fuck coronavirus! I have had 5 heart attacks a quad heart bypass and a heart pacemaker fitted. Cancel gigs for a virus? We ain't fucking Green Day piss - We are the real deal. No danger will we be cancelling our upcoming gigs. Punks Not Dead!\\" The tour was then cancelled four days later.

Anders Gustav Ekeberg attended school at Kalmar, S√∂der√•kra, Vestervik, and Karlskrona. He was a gifted student and enrolled at Uppsala University in 1784, graduating in 1788. His thesis addressed the extraction of oils from seeds. In 1789 and 1790, he traveled and studied in Germany, hearing Martin Heinrich Klaproth lecture in Berlin as well as Christian Ehrenfried Weigel in Greifswald. Career In 1794, Anders Gustav Ekeberg began teaching at Uppsala. He was a supporter of Antoine Lavoisier's proposals for systematizing chemical nomenclature. In 1795 he and Pehr von Afzelius published the first article to introduce the modern names for chemical elements such as hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen into the Swedish language, \\"On the Present State of Chemical Sciences\\". He was made docent in chemistry in 1794 and experimentator (laborator) in 1799, working as a demonstrator in the laboratory of Torbern Bergman. In 1798 he lectured on the theory of combustion. In 1799, he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Ekeberg suffered from poor health throughout his life. During his childhood a severe cold had impaired his hearing, which was further weakened over the years, so that it hindered his teaching activities. Subsequently, a gas explosion blinded him in one eye.Jorpes, J. Erik (1966) Jac. Berzelius ‚Äì his life and work; translated from the Swedish manuscript by Barbara Steele. Stockholm: Almqvist & Wiksell, 1966. (Reissued by University of California Press, Berkeley, 1970 ) Ekeberg was portrayed by his friends and students as a kind and gentle man. He died, unmarried, at the age of 46. Research The mineral yttrotantalite from Ytterby The element tantalum Ekeberg analyzed a number of the minerals found at Ytterby and Falun. In 1802 he analyzed specimens of tantalite from Kimito, Finland, and of yttrotantalite from Ytterby, Sweden. He is credited with finding the element tantalum in both. Ekeberg named the new element after the mythical Ancient Greek demigod Tantalus. According to legend, he was condemned to eternal frustration when he had to stand in water up to his neck, but the water receded as he attempted to drink. The Anders Gustaf Ekeberg Tantalum Prize In 2018 the Tantalum- Niobium International Study Center established The Anders Gustaf Ekeberg Tantalum Prize (\\"Ekeberg Prize\\"), an annual award to recognize excellence in tantalum research. The Prize will increase awareness of the many unique properties of tantalum products and the applications in which they excel. The inaugural winner of the Ekeberg Prize was Yuri Freeman, for his book ‚ÄúTantalum and Niobium-Based Capacitors‚Äù (Springer, 2018).

The person writing the cheque, known as the drawer, has a transaction banking account (often called a current, cheque, chequing or checking account) where their money is held. The drawer writes the various details including the monetary amount, date, and a payee on the cheque, and signs it, ordering their bank, known as the drawee, to pay that person or company the amount of money stated. Definition of a cheque as per The National Provincial Bank circa 1968 was \\"an unconditional order in writing drawn on a Banker, signed by the drawer, instructing the Banker to pay on demand a sum certain in money to or to the order of a specified person or to Bearer and which does not order any act to be done in addition to the payment of money\\". Although forms of cheques have been in use since ancient times and at least since the 9th century, it was during the 20th century that cheques became a highly popular non-cash method for making payments and the usage of cheques peaked. By the second half of the 20th century, as cheque processing became automated, billions of cheques were issued annually; these volumes peaked in or around the early 1990s. Since then cheque usage has fallen, being partly replaced by electronic payment systems. In an increasing number of countries cheques have either become a marginal payment system or have been completely phased out. Nature of a cheque A cheque is a negotiable instrument instructing a financial institution to pay a specific amount of a specific currency from a specified transactional account held in the drawer's name with that institution. Both the drawer and payee may be natural persons or legal entities. Cheques are order instruments, and are not in general payable simply to the bearer as bearer instruments are, but must be paid to the payee. In some countries, such as the US, the payee may endorse the cheque, allowing them to specify a third party to whom it should be paid. Cheques are a type of bill of exchange that were developed as a way to make payments without the need to carry large amounts of money. Paper money evolved from promissory notes, another form of negotiable instrument similar to cheques in that they were originally a written order to pay the given amount to whoever had it in their possession (the \\"bearer\\").  Spelling and etymology  The spellings check, checque, and cheque were used interchangeably from the 17th century until the 20th century. However, since the 19th century, the spelling cheque (from the French word ch√®que) has become standard for the financial instrument in the Commonwealth and Ireland, while check is used only for other meanings, thus distinguishing the two definitions in writing. Check is the original spelling.International Encyclopedia of Comparative Law, Instalment 9, Chapter 4: Negotiable Instruments, by Peter Ellinger. The newer spelling, cheque, is believed to have come into use around 1828, when the switch was made by James William Gilbart in his Practical Treatise on Banking. In American English, the usual spelling for both is check. Etymological dictionaries attribute the financial meaning to come from \\"a check against forgery\\", with the use of \\"check\\" to mean \\"control\\" stemming from a check in chess, a term which came into English through French, Latin, Arabic and ultimately from the Persian word shah, or \\"king\\".  History  The cheque had its origins in the ancient banking system, in which bankers would issue orders at the request of their customers, to pay money to identified payees. Such an order was referred to as a bill of exchange. The use of bills of exchange facilitated trade by eliminating the need for merchants to carry large quantities of currency (for example, gold) to purchase goods and services. = Early years = There is early evidence of using cheques. In India, during the Maurya Empire (from 321 to 185 BC), a commercial instrument called the adesha was in use, which was an order on a banker desiring him to pay the money of the note to a third person. The ancient Romans are believed to have used an early form of cheque known as praescriptiones in the 1st century BCE. Beginning in the third century CE, banks in Persian territory began to issue letters of credit. These letters were termed ƒçak, meaning \\"document\\" or \\"contract\\".Ilya Yakubovich. (2012). Journal of the American Oriental Society, 132(1), 116. doi:10.7817/jameroriesoci.132.1.0116 The ƒçak became the sakk later used by traders in the Abbasid Caliphate and other Arab- ruled lands. Transporting a paper sakk was more secure than transporting money. In the ninth century, a merchant in one country could cash a sakk drawn on his bank in another country. In the 13th century in Venice the bill of exchange was developed as a legal device to allow international trade without the need to carry large amounts of gold and silver. Their use subsequently spread to other European countries. In the early 1500s in the Dutch Republic, to protect large accumulations of cash, people began depositing their money with \\"cashiers\\". These cashiers held the money for a fee. Competition drove cashiers to offer additional services including paying money to any person bearing a written order from a depositor to do so. They kept the note as proof of payment. This concept went on to spread to England and elsewhere. = Modern era = By the 17th century, bills of exchange were being used for domestic payments in England. Cheques, a type of bill of exchange, then began to evolve. Initially they were called drawn notes, because they enabled a customer to draw on the funds that he or she had in the account with a bank and required immediate payment. These were handwritten, and one of the earliest known still to be in existence was drawn on Messrs Morris and Clayton, scriveners and bankers based in the City of London, and dated 16 February 1659. In 1717, the Bank of England pioneered the first use of a pre- printed form. These forms were printed on \\"cheque paper\\" to prevent fraud, and customers had to attend in person and obtain a numbered form from the cashier. Once written, the cheque was brought back to the bank for settlement. The suppression of banknotes in eighteenth-century England further promoted the use of cheques.Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, The Evolution of the cheque as a Means of Payment: A Historical Survey, 2008 Until about 1770, an informal exchange of cheques took place between London banks. Clerks of each bank visited all the other banks to exchange cheques, while keeping a tally of balances between them until they settled with each other. Daily cheque clearing began around 1770 when the bank clerks met at the Five Bells, a tavern in Lombard Street in the City of London, to exchange all their cheques in one place and settle the balances in cash. This was the first bankers' clearing house. Provincial clearing houses were established in major cities throughout the UK to facilitate the clearing of cheques on banks in the same town. Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol, Hull, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham, Sheffield and Southampton all had their own clearing houses.History of Cheques - Barclays, 2020 In America, the Bank of New York, after its establishment by Alexander Hamilton in 1784, began issuing cheques. The oldest surviving example of a complete American chequebook from the 1790s was discovered by a family in New Jersey. The documents are in some ways similar to modern-day checks, with some data pre-printed on sheets of paper alongside blank spaces for where other information could be hand-written as needed. It is thought that the Commercial Bank of Scotland was the first bank to personalize its customers' cheques, in 1811, by printing the name of the account holder vertically along the left-hand edge. In 1830 the Bank of England introduced books of 50, 100, and 200 forms and counterparts, bound or stitched. These cheque books became a common format for the distribution of cheques to bank customers. In the late 19th century, several countries formalized laws regarding cheques. The UK passed the Bills of Exchange Act 1882, and India passed the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881; which both covered cheques. An English cheque from 1956 having a bank clerk's red mark verifying the signature, a two-pence stamp duty, and holes punched by hand to cancel it. This is a \\"crossed cheque\\" disallowing transfer of payment to another account. In 1931 an attempt was made to simplify the international use of cheques by the Geneva Convention on the Unification of the Law Relating to Cheques. Many European and South American states as well as Japan joined the convention. However, countries including the US and members of the British Commonwealth did not participate and so it remained very difficult for cheques to be used across country borders. In 1959 a standard for machine-readable characters (MICR) was agreed and patented in the US for use with cheques. This opened the way for the first automated reader/sorting machines for clearing cheques. As automation increased, the following years saw a dramatic change in the way in which cheques were handled and processed. Cheque volumes continued to grow; in the late 20th century, cheques were the most popular non-cash method for making payments, with billions of them processed each year. Most countries saw cheque volumes peak in the late 1980s or early 1990s, after which electronic payment methods became more popular and the use of cheques declined. In 1969 cheque guarantee cards were introduced in several countries, allowing a retailer to confirm that a cheque would be honoured when used at a point of sale. The drawer would sign the cheque in front of the retailer, who would compare the signature to the signature on the card and then write the cheque-guarantee-card number on the back of the cheque. Such cards were generally phased out and replaced by debit cards, starting in the mid-1990s. From the mid-1990s, many countries enacted laws to allow for cheque truncation, in which a physical cheque is converted into electronic form for transmission to the paying bank or clearing-house. This eliminates the cumbersome physical presentation and saves time and processing costs. In 2002, the Eurocheque system was phased out and replaced with domestic clearing systems. Old eurocheques could still be used, but they were now processed by national clearing systems. At that time, a number of countries took the opportunity to phase out the use of cheques altogether. As of 2010, many countries have either phased out the use of cheques altogether or signalled that they would do so in the future.  Parts of a cheque  frameParts of a cheque based on a UK example The four main items on a cheque are: * Drawer: the person or entity whose transaction account is to be drawn. Usually, the drawer‚Äôs name and account is preprinted on the cheque, and the drawer is usually the signatory. * Payee: the person or entity who is to be paid the amount. * Drawee: the bank or other financial institution where the cheque can be presented for payment. This is usually preprinted on the cheque. * Amount: the currency amount. The amount and currency (eg., dollars, pounds, etc.) usually must be written in words and in figures. The currency is usually the local currency, but may be a foreign currency. As cheque usage increased during the 19th and 20th centuries, additional items were added to increase security or to make processing easier for the financial institution. A signature of the drawer was required to authorize the cheque, and this is the main way to authenticate the cheque. Second, it became customary to write the amount in words as well as in numbers to avoid mistakes and make it harder to fraudulently alter the amount after the cheque had been written. It is not a legal requirement to write the amount in words, although some banks will refuse to accept cheques that do not have the amount in both numbers and words. An issue date was added, and cheques may become invalid a certain amount of time after issue. In the US and Canada a cheque is typically valid for six months after the date of issue, after which it is a stale-dated cheque, but this depends on where the cheque is drawn. In Australia a cheque is typically valid for fifteen months of the cheque date. A cheque that has an issue date in the future, a post-dated cheque, may not be able to be presented until that date has passed. In some countries writing a post dated cheque may simply be ignored or is illegal. Conversely, an antedated cheque has an issue date in the past. A cheque number was added and cheque books were issued so that cheque numbers were sequential. This allowed for some basic fraud detection by banks and made sure one cheque was not presented twice. In some countries, such as the US, cheques may contain a memo line where the purpose of the cheque can be indicated as a convenience without affecting the official parts of the cheque. In the United Kingdom a memo line is not available and such notes may be written on the reverse side of the cheque. In the US, at the top (when cheque oriented vertically) of the reverse side of the cheque, there are usually one or more blank lines labelled something like \\"Endorse here\\". Starting in the 1960s, machine readable routing and account information was added to the bottom of cheques in MICR format, which allowed automated sorting and routing of cheques between banks and led to automated central clearing facilities. The information provided at the bottom of the cheque is country- specific and standards are set by each country's cheque clearing system. This means that the payee no longer has to go to the bank that issued the cheque, instead they can deposit it at their own bank or any other bank and the cheque would be routed back to the originating bank, and funds transferred to their own bank account. In the US, the bottom 5/8 inchMICR Basics Handbook of the cheque is reserved for MICR characters only. Intrusion into the MICR area can cause problems when the cheque runs through the clearinghouse, requiring someone to print an MICR cheque correction strip and glue it to the cheque. Many new ATMs do not use deposit envelopes and actually scan the cheque at the time it is deposited and will rejectCPM Federal Credit Union Deposit ATM FAQ Retrieved 2016-03-20. Also, this author received a couple checks with handwriting incursion of the MICR characters which were rejected. cheques due to handwriting incursion which interferes with reading the MICR. This can cause considerable inconvenience as the depositor may have to wait days for the bank to be open and may have difficulty getting to the bank even when they are open; this can delay the availability of the portion of a deposit which their bank makes available immediately as well as the balance of the deposit. Terms of service for many mobile (cell phone camera) deposits also require the MICR section to be readable. Not all of the MICR characters have been printed at the time the cheque is written, as additional characters will be printed later to encode the amount; thus a sloppy signature could obscure characters that will later be printed there. Since MICR characters are no longer necessarily printed in magnetic ink and will be scanned by optical rather than magnetic means, the readers will be unable to distinguish pen ink from pre- printed magnetic ink; these changes allow cheques to be printed on ordinary home and office printers without requiring pre-printed cheque forms, allow ATM deposit capture, allow mobile deposits, and facilitate electronic copies of cheques. For additional protection, a cheque can be crossed, which restricts the use of the cheque so that the funds must be paid into a bank account. The format and wording varies from country to country, but generally two parallel lines may be placed either vertically across the cheque or in the top left hand corner. In addition the words 'or bearer' must not be used, or if pre- printed on the cheque must be crossed out on the payee line. If the cheque is crossed with the words 'Account Payee' or similar then the cheque can only be paid into the bank account of the person initially named as the payee, thus it cannot be endorsed to a different payee. = Attached documents = Cheques sometimes include additional documents. A page in a chequebook may consist of both the cheque itself and a stub or ' ‚Äì when the cheque is written, only the cheque itself is detached, and the stub is retained in the chequebook as a record of the cheque. Alternatively, cheques may be recorded with carbon paper behind each cheque, in ledger sheets between cheques or at the back of a chequebook, or in a completely separate transaction register that comes with a chequebook. When a cheque is mailed, a separate letter or \\"remittance advice\\" may be attached to inform the recipient of the purpose of the cheque ‚Äì formally, which account receivable to credit the funds to. This is frequently done formally using a provided slip when paying a bill, or informally via a letter when sending an ad hoc cheque.  Usage  Cheques may be valid regardless of amount.Parties to regular cheques generally include a drawer, the depositor writing a cheque; a drawee, the financial institution where the cheque can be presented for payment; and a payee, the entity to whom the drawer issues the cheque. The drawer drafts or draws a cheque, which is also called cutting a cheque, especially in the US. There may also be a beneficiary‚Äîfor example, in depositing a cheque with a custodian of a brokerage account, the payee will be the custodian, but the cheque may be marked \\"F/B/O\\" (\\"for the benefit of\\") the beneficiary. Ultimately, there is also at least one endorsee which would typically be the financial institution servicing the payee's account, or in some circumstances may be a third party to whom the payee owes or wishes to give money. A payee that accepts a cheque will typically deposit it in an account at the payee's bank, and have the bank process the cheque. In some cases, the payee will take the cheque to a branch of the drawee bank, and cash the cheque there. If a cheque is refused at the drawee bank (or the drawee bank returns the cheque to the bank that it was deposited at) because there are insufficient funds for the cheque to clear, it is said that the cheque has been dishonoured. Once a cheque is approved and all appropriate accounts involved have been credited, the cheque is stamped with some kind of cancellation mark, such as a \\"paid\\" stamp. The cheque is now a cancelled cheque. Cancelled cheques are placed in the account holder's file. The account holder can request a copy of a cancelled cheque as proof of a payment. This is known as the cheque clearing cycle. Cheques can be lost or go astray within the cycle, or be delayed if further verification is needed in the case of suspected fraud. A cheque may thus bounce some time after it has been deposited. Symbolic cheques are used at events to depict money offered to the payee. Following concerns about the amount of time it took the Cheque and Credit Clearing Company to clear cheques, the United Kingdom Office of Fair Trading set up a working group in 2006 to look at the cheque clearing cycle. Their report said that clearing times could be improved, but that the costs associated with speeding up the cheque clearing cycle could not be justified considering the use of cheques was declining. However, they concluded the biggest problem was the unlimited time a bank could take to dishonour a cheque. To address this, changes were implemented so that the maximum time after a cheque was deposited that it could be dishonoured was six days, what was known as the \\"certainty of fate\\" principle. An advantage to the drawer of using cheques instead of debit card transactions, is that they know the drawer's bank will not release the money until several days later. Paying with a cheque and making a deposit before it clears the drawer's bank is called \\"kiting\\" or \\"floating\\" and is generally illegal in the US, but rarely enforced unless the drawer uses multiple chequing accounts with multiple institutions to increase the delay or to steal the funds.  Declining use  Cheque usage has been declining for some years, both for point of sale transactions (for which credit cards and debit cards are increasingly preferred) and for third party payments (for example, bill payments), where the decline has been accelerated by the emergence of telephone banking and online banking. Being paper-based, cheques are costly for banks to process in comparison to electronic payments, so banks in many countries now discourage the use of cheques, either by charging for cheques or by making the alternatives more attractive to customers. In particular the handling of money transfer requires more effort and is time-consuming. The cheque has to be handed over in person or sent through mail. The rise of automated teller machines (ATMs) means that small amounts of cash are often easily accessible, so that it is sometimes unnecessary to write a cheque for such amounts instead. = Alternatives to cheques = Alternative payment systems include: # Cash # Debit card payments # Credit card payments # Direct debit (initiated by payee) # Direct credit (initiated by payer), ACH in US, giro in Europe, Direct Entry in Australia # Wire transfer (local and international) such as Western Union and MoneyGram # Electronic bill payments using Internet banking # Online payment services, e.g. PayPal, Unified Payments Interface, PhonePe, Paytm and Worldpay # Money orders = Europe = In most European countries, cheques are now rarely used, even for third party payments. In these countries, it is standard practice for businesses to publish their bank details on invoices, to facilitate the receipt of payments by giro. Even before the introduction of online banking, it has been possible in some countries to make payments to third parties using ATMs, which may accurately and rapidly capture invoice amounts, due dates, and payee bank details via a bar code reader to reduce keying. In some countries, entering the bank account number results in the bank revealing the name of the payee as an added safeguard against fraud. In using a cheque, the onus is on the payee to initiate the payment, whereas with a giro transfer, the onus is on the payer to effect the payment (The writer of a paper cheque is pushing on a rope: he cannot force money out of his own account and into the destination's account. By writing the paper cheque, he is handing the far end of the rope to the payee, who will pull in his own good time. In contrast, giro is more akin to wire transfer, in that the payer pushes his money away towards the payee). The process is also procedurally more simple, as no cheques are ever posted, can claim to have been posted, or need banking or clearance. In Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Scandinavia, cheques have almost completely vanished in favour of direct bank transfers and electronic payments. Direct bank transfers, using so-called giro transfers, have been standard procedure since the 1950s to send and receive regular payments like rent and wages and even mail-order invoices. In the Netherlands, Austria, and Germany, all kinds of invoices are commonly accompanied by so- called ' (Netherlands) or ' (German), which are essentially standardized bank transfer order forms preprinted with the payee's account details and the amount payable. The payer fills in his account details and hands the form to a clerk at his bank, which will then transfer the money. It is also very common to allow the payee to automatically withdraw the requested amount from the payer's account (Lastschrifteinzug (German) or Incasso (machtiging) (Netherlands)). Though similar to paying by cheque, the payee only needs the payer's bank and account number. Since the early 1990s, this method of payment has also been available to merchants. Due to this, credit cards are rather uncommon in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands, and are mostly used to give access to credit rather than as a payment mechanism. However, debit cards are widespread in these countries, since virtually all Austrian, German and Dutch banks issue debit cards instead of simple ATM cards for use on current accounts. Acceptance of cheques has been further diminished since the late 1990s, because of the abolition of the Eurocheque. Cashing a foreign bank cheque is possible, but usually very expensive. In Finland, banks stopped issuing personal cheques in about 1993 in favour of giro systems, which are now almost exclusively electronically initiated either via internet banking or payment machines located at banks and shopping malls. All Nordic countries have used an interconnected international giro system since the 1950s, and in Sweden, cheques are now almost totally abandoned; in Denmark, all banks stopped accepting cheques starting on January 1, 2017. Debit cards are now preferred for direct shop payments when not using cash. For large shop payments, such as car purchases, a type of cheque, a money order (Swedish:postv√§xel) is still used. In Poland cheques were withdrawn from use in 2006, mainly because of lack of popularity due to the widespread adoption of credit and debit cards. Electronic payments across the European Union are now fast and inexpensive‚Äîusually free for consumers. In the United Kingdom, Ireland, and France, cheques are still popular, partly because cheques remain free of charge to personal customers; however, bank-to-bank transfers are increasing in popularity. Since 2001, businesses in the United Kingdom have made more electronic payments than cheque payments. Automated payments rose from 753 million in 1995 to 1.1 billion in 2001 and cheques declined in that same period of time from 1.14 to 1.1 billion payments. Most utilities in the United Kingdom charge lower prices to customers who pay by direct debit than for other payment methods, including electronic methods. The vast majority of retailers in the United Kingdom and many in France have not accepted cheques as a means of payment for several years, and cheque guarantee cards are no longer issued. For example, Shell announced in September 2005 that it would no longer accept cheques at its UK petrol stations. This was soon followed by other major fuel retailers, such as Texaco, BP, and Total. Asda announced in April 2006 that it would stop accepting cheques, initially as a trial in the London area, and Boots announced in September 2006 that it would stop accepting cheques, initially as a trial in Sussex and Surrey. Currys (and other stores in the DSGi group) and WH Smith also no longer accept cheques. Cheques are now widely predicted to become a thing of the past, or at most, a niche product used to pay private individuals or for the very large number of small service providers who are not willing to provide their bank details to customers to allow electronic payments to be made to them or do not wish to be burdened with checking their bank accounts frequently and reconciling them with amounts due (for example, music teachers, driving instructors, children's sports lessons, small shops, schools). The UK Payments Council announced in December 2009 that cheques would be phased out by October 2018, but only if adequate alternatives were developed. They intended to perform annual checks on the progress of other payments systems and a final review of the decision would have been held in 2016. Concerns were expressed, however, by charities and older people, who are still heavy users of cheques, and replacement plans were criticized as open to fraud. It was therefore announced by the UK Payments Council in July 2011 that the cheque would not be eliminated. 432 million inter-bank cheques and credit-items worth ¬£472 billion were processed in the United Kingdom in 2016 according to Payments UK. In 2017, 405 million cheques worth ¬£356 billion were used for payments and acquiring cash, an average of 1.2 million cheques per day, with more than 10 million being cleared in Northern Ireland alone. The Cheque and Credit Clearing Company noted that cheques continue to be highly valued for paying tradesmen and utility bills, and play a vital role in business, clubs and societies sectors, with nine in 10 business saying that they received or made payment by cheque on a monthly basis. In June 2014, following a successful trial in the UK by Barclays, the British government gave the go-ahead for a cheque photo plan allowing people to pay in a cheque by taking a photo of it, rather than physically depositing the paper cheque at a bank. = North America (Canada and the United States) = In 2002 the US still relied heavily on cheques, due to the convenience it affords payers, and due to the absence of a high volume system for low value electronic payments. Since then the decline in cheque usage seen around the world has also started in the US. The cheque, although not as common as it used to be, is still a long way from disappearing completely in the US. In the US, an estimated 18.3 billion cheques were paid in 2012, with a value of $25.9 trillion. About 70 billion cheques were written annually in the US by 2001, though around 17 million adult Americans do not have bank accounts at all. Certain companies whom a person pays with a cheque will turn it into an Automated Clearing House (ACH) or electronic transaction. Banks try to save time processing cheques by sending them electronically between banks. Cheque clearing is usually done through an electronic cheque broker, such as The Clearing House, Viewpointe LLC or the Federal Reserve Banks. Copies of the cheques are stored at a bank or the broker, for periods up to 99 years, and this is why some cheque archives have grown to 20 petabytes. The access to these archives is now worldwide, as most bank programming is now done offshore. Many utilities and most credit cards will also allow customers to pay by providing bank information and having the payee draw payment from the customer's account (direct debit). Many people in the US still use paper money orders to pay bills or transfer money which is a unique type of cheque. They have security advantages over mailing cash, and do not require access to a bank account. Canada's usage of cheques is less than that of the US and is declining rapidly at the urging of the Canadian Banking Association. The Government of Canada claims it is 6.5 times more expensive to mail a cheque than to make a direct deposit. The Canadian Payments Association reported that in 2012, cheque use in Canada accounted for only 40% of total financial transactions. The Interac system, which allows instant fund transfers via chip or magnetic strip and PIN, is widely used by merchants to the point that few brick and mortar merchants accept cheques. Many merchants accept Interac debit payments but not credit card payments, even though most Interac terminals can support credit card payments. Financial institutions also facilitate transfers between accounts within different institutions with the Email Money Transfer (EMT) service. Cheques are still used for government payments, payroll, rent, and utility bill payments, though direct deposits and online or telephone bill payments are more widely and increasingly used. The Canadian government began phasing out all government cheques from April 2016. = Asia = In many Asian countries cheques were never widely used and generally only used by the wealthy, with cash being used for the majority of payments. Where cheques were used they have been declining rapidly, by 2009 there was negligible consumer cheque usage in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. This declining trend was accelerated by these developed markets advanced financial services infrastructure. Many of the developing countries in Asia have seen an increasing use of electronic payment systems, 'leap-frogging' the less efficient chequeing system altogether. India is one of the few countries in Asia that did have significant cheque usage. It had a long tradition of using cheques and passed laws formalising cheque usage as early as 1881. In 2009 cheques were still widely used as a means of payment in trade, and also by individuals to pay other individuals or utility bills. One of the reasons was that banks usually provided cheques for free to their individual account holders. However, cheques are now rarely accepted at point of sale in retail stores where cash and cards are payment methods of choice. Electronic payment transfer continued to gain popularity in India and like other countries this caused a subsequent reduction in volumes of cheques issued each year. In 2009 the Reserve Bank of India reported there was a five percent decline in cheque usage compared to the previous year. = Oceania = In Australia, following global trends, the use of cheques continues to decline. In 1994 the value of daily cheque transactions was A$25 billion; by 2004 this had dropped to only A$5 billion, and by 2018 this had dropped to only A$1 billion, with almost half of this for B2B transactions. Personal cheque use is practically non- existent thanks to the longstanding use of the EFTPOS system, BPAY, electronic transfers, and debit cards. In New Zealand, payments by cheque have declined since the mid-1990s in favour of electronic payment methods. In 1993, cheques accounted for over half of transactions through the national banking system, with an annual average of 130 cheques per capita. By 2006 cheques lagged well behind EFTPOS (debit card) transaction and electronic credits, making up only nine per cent of transactions, an annual average of 41 cheque transaction per capita. Most retail stores no longer accept cheques; those that do often require government-issued identification or a store-issued \\"cheque identification card\\" before they can be accepted as payment. In 2020, state owned Kiwibank discontinued cheques. In the same year, all four major banks (ASB, BNZ, ANZ and Westpac) also announced plans to discontinue cheques.  Variations on regular cheques  In addition to regular cheques, a number of variations were developed to address specific needs or address issues when using a regular cheque. = Cashier's cheques and bank drafts = Cashier's cheques and banker's drafts, also known as bank cheques, banker's cheques or treasurer's cheques, are cheques issued against the funds of a financial institution rather than an individual account holder. Typically, the term cashier's check is used in the US and banker's draft is used in the UK and most of the Commonwealth. The mechanism differs slightly from country to country but in general the bank issuing the cheque or draft will allocate the funds at the point the cheque is drawn. This provides a guarantee, save for a failure of the bank, that it will be honoured. Cashier's cheques are perceived to be as good as cash but they are still a cheque, a misconception sometimes exploited by scam artists. A lost or stolen cheque can still be stopped like any other cheque, so payment is not completely guaranteed. = Certified cheque = When a certified cheque is drawn, the bank operating the account verifies there are currently sufficient funds in the drawer's account to honour the cheque. Those funds are then set aside in the bank's internal account until the cheque is cashed or returned by the payee. Thus, a certified cheque cannot \\"bounce\\", and its liquidity is similar to cash, absent failure of the bank. The bank indicates this fact by making a notation on the face of the cheque (technically called an acceptance). = Payroll cheque = A cheque used to pay wages may be referred to as a payroll cheque. Even when the use of cheques for paying wages and salaries became rare, the vocabulary \\"pay cheque\\" still remained commonly used to describe the payment of wages and salaries. Payroll cheques issued by the military to soldiers, or by some other government entities to their employees, beneficiants, and creditors, are referred to as warrants. = Warrants = Warrants look like cheques and clear through the banking system like cheques, but are not drawn against cleared funds in a deposit account. A cheque differs from a warrant in that the warrant is not necessarily payable on demand and may not be negotiable. They are often issued by government entities such as the military to pay wages or suppliers. In this case they are an instruction to the entity's treasurer department to pay the warrant holder on demand or after a specified maturity date. = Traveller's cheque = A traveller's cheque is designed to allow the person signing it to make an unconditional payment to someone else as a result of paying the issuer for that privilege. Traveller's cheques can usually be replaced if lost or stolen, and people frequently used them on holiday instead of cash as many businesses used to accept traveller's cheques as currency. The use of credit or debit cards has begun to replace the traveller's cheque as the standard for vacation money due to their convenience and additional security for the retailer. As a result, many businesses no longer accept traveller's cheques. = Money or postal order = A cheque sold by a post office, bank, or merchant such as a grocery store for payment in favour of a third party is referred to as a money order or postal order. These are paid for in advance when the order is drawn and are guaranteed by the institution that issues them and can only be paid to the named third party. This was a common way to send low value payments to third parties, avoiding the risks associated with sending cash by post, prior to the advent of electronic payment methods. = Oversized cheques = Presentation of the Ansari X Prize $10 million award Oversized cheques are often used in public events such as donating money to charity or giving out prizes such as Publishers Clearing House. The cheques are commonly in size; however, according to the Guinness Book of World Records, the largest ever is . Until recently, regardless of the size, such cheques could still be redeemed for their cash value as long as they would have the same parts as a normal cheque, although usually the oversized cheque is kept as a souvenir and a normal cheque is provided. Any bank could levy additional charges for clearing an oversized cheque. Most banks need to have the machine-readable information on the bottom of cheques read electronically, so only very limited dimensions can be allowed due to standardised equipment. = Payment vouchers = In the US some public assistance programmes such as the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, or Aid to Families with Dependent Children make vouchers available to their beneficiaries, which are good up to a certain monetary amount for purchase of grocery items deemed eligible under the particular programme. The voucher can be deposited like any other cheque by a participating supermarket or other approved business.  Cheques around the world  = Australia = The Cheques Act 1986 is the body of law governing the issuance of cheques and payment orders in Australia. Procedural and practical issues governing the clearance of cheques and payment orders are handled by Australian Payments Clearing Association (APCA). In 1999, banks adopted a system to allow faster clearance of cheques by electronically transmitting information about cheques, this brought clearance times down from five to three days. Prior to that cheques had to be physically transported to the paying bank before processing began. If the cheque was dishonoured, it was physically returned. All licensed banks in Australia may issue cheques in their own name. Non-banks are not permitted to issue cheques in their own name but may issue, and have drawn on them, payment orders (which functionally are no different from cheques). = Canada = In Canada, cheque sizes and types, endorsement requirements and MICR tolerances are overseen by Payments Canada. * Canadian cheques can legally be written in English, French or Inuktitut. * A tele-cheque is a paper payment item that resembles a cheque except that it is neither created nor signed by the payer‚Äîinstead it is created (and may be signed) by a third party on behalf of the payer. Under CPA Rules these are prohibited in the clearing system effective 1 January 2004. = India = The Cheque was introduced in India by the Bank of Hindustan, the first joint stock bank established in 1770. In 1881, the Negotiable Instruments Act (NI Act) was enacted in India, formalising the usage and characteristics of instruments like the cheque, the bill of exchange, and promissory note. The NI Act provided a legal framework for non-cash paper payment instruments in India. In 1938, the Calcutta Clearing Banks' Association, which was the largest bankers' association at that time, adopted clearing house. Until 1 April 2012, cheques in India were valid for a period of six months from the date of their issue, before the Reserve Bank of India issued a notification reducing their validity to three months from the date of issue. = Japan = In Japan, cheques are called , and are governed by . Bounced cheques are called . If an account owner bounces two cheques in six months, the bank will suspend the account for two years. If the account belongs to a public company, their stock will also be suspended from trading on the stock exchange, which can lead to bankruptcy. = New Zealand = Instrument-specific legislation includes the Cheques Act 1960, part of the Bills of Exchange Act 1908, which codifies aspects related to the cheque payment instrument, notably the procedures for the endorsement, presentment and payment of cheques. A 1995 amendment provided for the electronic presentment of cheques and removed the previous requirement to deliver cheques physically to the paying bank, opening the way for cheque truncation and imaging. Truncation allows for the transmission of an electronic image of all or part of the cheque to the paying bank's branch, instead of cumbersome physical presentment. This reduced the total cheque clearance time and eliminated the costs of physically moving the cheque. The registered banks under supervision of Reserve Bank of New Zealand provide the cheque payment services. Once banked, cheques are processed electronically together with other retail payment instruments. Homeguard v Kiwi Packaging is often cited case law regarding the banking of cheques tendered as full settlement of disputed accounts.[1981] 2 NZLR 322 = United Kingdom = In the UK all cheques must now conform to an industry standard detailing layout and font (\\"Cheque and Credit Clearing Company (C&CCC;) Standard 3\\"), be printed on a specific weight of paper (CBS1), and contain explicitly defined security features. Since 1995, all cheque printers must be members of the Cheque Printer Accreditation Scheme (CPAS). The scheme is managed by the Cheque and Credit Clearing Company and requires that all cheques for use in the British clearing process are produced by accredited printers who have adopted stringent security standards. The rules concerning crossed cheques are set out in Section 1 of the Cheques Act 1992 and prevent cheques being cashed by or paid into the accounts of third parties. On a crossed cheque the words ‚Äúaccount payee only‚Äù (or similar) are printed between two parallel vertical lines in the centre of the cheque. This makes the cheque non-transferable and is to avoid cheques being endorsed and paid into an account other than that of the named payee. Crossing cheques basically ensures that the money is paid into an account of the intended beneficiary of the cheque. Following concerns about the amount of time it took banks to clear cheques, the United Kingdom Office of Fair Trading set up a working group in 2006 to look at the cheque clearing cycle. They produced a report recommending maximum times for the cheque clearing which were introduced in UK from November 2007. In the report the date the credit appeared on the recipient's account (usually the day of deposit) was designated \\"T\\". At \\"T + 2\\" (two business days afterwards) the value would count for calculation of credit interest or overdraft interest on the recipient's account. At \\"T + 4\\" clients would be able to withdraw funds on current accounts or at \\"T + 6\\" on savings accounts (though this will often happen earlier, at the bank's discretion). \\"T + 6\\" is the last day that a cheque can bounce without the recipient's permission‚Äîthis is known as \\"certainty of fate\\". Before the introduction of this standard (also known as 2-4-6 for current accounts and 2-6-6 for savings accounts), the only way to know the \\"fate\\" of a cheque has been \\"Special Presentation\\", which would normally involve a fee, where the drawee bank contacts the payee bank to see if the payee has that money at that time. \\"Special Presentation\\" had been stated at the time of deposit. Cheque volumes peaked in 1990 when four billion cheque payments were made. Of these, 2.5 billion were cleared through the inter-bank clearing managed by the C&CCC;, the remaining 1.5 billion being in- house cheques which were either paid into the branch on which they were drawn or processed intra-bank without going through the clearings. As volumes started to fall, the challenges faced by the clearing banks were then of a different nature: how to benefit from technology improvements in a declining business environment. Although the UK did not adopt the euro as its national currency when other European countries did in 1999, many banks began offering euro denominated accounts with chequebooks, principally to business customers. The cheques can be used to pay for certain goods and services in the UK. The same year, the C&CCC; set up the euro cheque clearing system to process euro denominated cheques separately from sterling cheques in Great Britain. The UK Payments Council from 30 June 2011 withdrew the existing Cheque Guarantee Card Scheme in the UK. This service allowed cheques to be guaranteed at point of sales up to a certain value, normally ¬£50 or ¬£100, when signed in front of the retailer with the additional cheque guarantee card. This was after a long period of decline in their use in favour of debit cards. The Payments Council proposed to close the centralised cheque clearing altogether in the UK and had set a target date of 31 October 2018. However, on 12 July 2011, the Payments Council announced that after opposition from MPs, charity groups and public opinion, the cheque will remain in use and there would no longer be a reason to seek an alternative paper-initiated payment. = United States = In the United States, cheques are referred to as checks and are governed by Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code, under the rubric of negotiable instruments. * An order check‚Äîthe most common form in the US‚Äîis payable only to the named payee or his or her endorsee, as it usually contains the language \\"Pay to the order of (name)\\". * A bearer check is payable to anyone who is in possession of the document: this would be the case if the cheque does not name a payee, or is payable to \\"bearer\\" or to \\"cash\\" or \\"to the order of cash\\", or if the cheque is payable to someone who is not a person or legal entity, for example if the payee line is marked \\"Happy Birthday\\". * A counter check is one that a bank issues to an account holder in person. This is typically done for customers who have opened a new account or have run out of personalized checks. It may lack the usual security features. In the US, the terminology for a cheque historically varied with the type of financial institution on which it is drawn. In the case of a savings and loan association it was a negotiable order of withdrawal (compare Negotiable Order of Withdrawal account); if a credit union it was a share draft. \\"Checks\\" were associated with chartered commercial banks. However, common usage has increasingly conformed to more recent versions of Article 3, where check means any or all of these negotiable instruments. Certain types of cheques drawn on a government agency, especially payroll cheques, may be called a payroll warrant. At the bottom of each cheque there is the routing/account number in MICR format. The ABA routing transit number is a nine-digit number in which the first four digits identifies the US Federal Reserve Bank's cheque- processing centre. This is followed by digits 5 through 8, identifying the specific bank served by that cheque-processing centre. Digit 9 is a verification check digit, computed using a complex algorithm of the previous eight digits. * Typically the routing number is followed by a group of eight or nine MICR digits that indicates the particular account number at that bank. The account number is assigned independently by the various banks. * Typically the account number is followed by a group of three or four MICR digits that indicates a particular cheque number from that account. * Directional routing number‚Äîalso known as the transit number, consists of a denominator mirroring the first four digits of the routing number, and a hyphenated numerator, also known as the ABA number, in which the first part is a city code (1‚Äì49), if the account is in one of 49 specific cities, or a state code (50‚Äì99) if it is not in one of those specific cities; the second part of the hyphenated numerator mirrors the 5th through 8th digits of the routing number with leading zeros removed. A draft in the US Uniform Commercial Code is any bill of exchange, whether payable on demand or at a later date. If payable on demand it is a \\"demand draft\\", or if drawn on a financial institution, a cheque. The electronic cheque or substitute cheque was formally adopted in the US in 2004 with the passing of the \\"Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act\\" (or Check 21 Act). This allowed the creation of electronic cheques and translation (truncation) of paper cheques into electronic replacements, reducing cost and processing time. The specification for US cheques is given by ANSI committee X9 Technical Report 2. = Turkey = In Turkey, cheques are usually used for commercial transactions only, and using post-dated cheques is legally permissible.  Cheque fraud  Cheques have been a tempting target for criminals to steal money or goods from the drawer, payee or the banks. A number of measures have been introduced to combat fraud over the years. These range from things like writing a cheque so it is difficult to alter after it is drawn, to mechanisms like crossing a cheque so that it can only be paid into another bank's account providing some traceability. However, the inherent security weaknesses of cheques as a payment method, such as having only the signature as the main authentication method and not knowing if funds will be received until the clearing cycle to complete, have made them vulnerable to a number of different types of fraud. = Embezzlement = Taking advantage of the float period (cheque kiting) to delay the notice of non-existent funds. This often involves trying to convince a merchant or other recipient, hoping the recipient will not suspect that the cheque will not clear, giving time for the fraudster to disappear. = Forgery = Sometimes, forgery is the method of choice in defrauding a bank. One form of forgery involves the use of a victim's legitimate cheques, that have either been stolen and then cashed, or altering a cheque that has been legitimately written to the perpetrator, by adding words or digits to inflate the amount. = Identity theft = Since cheques include significant personal information (name, account number, signature and in some countries driver's license number, the address or phone number of the account holder), they can be used for identity theft. The practice was discontinued as identity theft became widespread.  Dishonoured cheques  A dishonoured cheque cannot be redeemed for its value and is worthless; they are also known as an RDI (returned deposit item), or NSF (non- sufficient funds) cheque. Cheques are usually dishonoured because the drawer's account has been frozen or limited, or because there are insufficient funds in the drawer's account when the cheque was redeemed. A cheque drawn on an account with insufficient funds is said to have bounced and may be called a rubber cheque. Banks will typically charge customers for issuing a dishonoured cheque, and in some jurisdictions such an act is a criminal action. A drawer may also issue a stop on a cheque, instructing the financial institution not to honour a particular cheque. In England and Wales, they are typically returned marked \\"Refer to Drawer\\"‚Äîan instruction to contact the person issuing the cheque for an explanation as to why the cheque was not honoured. This wording was brought in after a bank was successfully sued for libel after returning a cheque with the phrase \\"Insufficient Funds\\" after making an error‚Äîthe court ruled that as there were sufficient funds the statement was demonstrably false and damaging to the reputation of the person issuing the cheque. Despite the use of this revised phrase, successful libel lawsuits brought against banks by individuals remained for similar errors. In Scotland, a cheque acts as an assignment of the amount of money to the payee. As such, if a cheque is dishonoured in Scotland, what funds are present in the bank account are \\"attached\\" and frozen, until either sufficient funds are credited to the account to pay the cheque, the drawer recovers the cheque and hands it into the bank, or the drawer obtains a letter from the payee stating that they have no further interest in the cheque. A cheque may also be dishonoured because it is stale or not cashed within a \\"void after date\\". Many cheques have an explicit notice printed on the cheque that it is void after some period of days. In the US, banks are not required by the Uniform Commercial Code to honour a , which is a cheque presented six months after it is dated. = Consumer reporting = In the United States some consumer reporting agencies such as ChexSystems, Early Warning Services, and TeleCheck have been providing cheque verification services that track how people manage their checking accounts. Banks use the agencies to screen checking account applicants. Those with low debit scores are denied checking accounts because a bank can not afford an account to be overdrawn. In the United Kingdom, in common with other items such as Direct Debits or standing orders, dishonoured cheques can be reported on a customer's credit file, although not individually and this does not happen universally amongst banks. Dishonoured payments from current accounts can be marked in the same manner as missed payments on the customer's credit report.  Lock box  Typically when customers pay bills with cheques (like gas or water bills), the mail will go to a \\"lock box\\" at the post office. There a bank will pick up all the mail, sort it, open it, take the cheques and remittance advice out, process it all through electronic machinery, and post the funds to the proper accounts. In modern systems, taking advantage of the Check 21 Act, as in the US, many cheques are transformed into electronic objects and the paper is destroyed.

A king so threatened is said to be in check. A player must get out of check, if possible, by interposing a piece between the threatening piece and the king, capturing the threatening piece, or moving the king to a square where it is no longer in check. If the player cannot move out of check, the game ends in checkmate and the player loses. Players cannot make any move that puts their own king in check. Introduction A check is the result of a move that places the opposing king under an immediate threat of capture by at least one of the player's pieces. Making a move that checks is sometimes called \\"giving check\\". If the king is in check and the checked player has no legal move to get out of check, the king is checkmated and the player loses. Under the standard rules of chess, a player may not make any move that places or leaves their king in check. A player may move the king, capture the threatening piece, or block the check with another piece., , A king cannot itself directly check the opposing king, since this would place the first king in check as well. A move of the king could expose the opposing king to a discovered check by another piece, however. In informal games, it is common to announce \\"check\\" when making a move that puts the opponent's king in check. In formal competition, however, announcing check is discouraged. In fast chess, depending on the rules in effect, placing or leaving one's king in check may result in immediate loss of the game. Getting out of check { align=\\"right\\" border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" -valign=\\"top\\"   } There may be up to three possible ways to get a king out of a single check on the following move: #Capturing the checking piece, with either the king or another piece. If the checking piece threatens the king, the king can capture the piece if the king does not move into a new check (i.e. if the piece is not protected by another enemy piece). Likewise, a piece that is pinned to the king cannot capture the checking piece if such a move would place the king in check from the pinning piece. #Moving the king to an adjacent square where it is not in check. The king is not allowed to castle when it is in check. The king may capture an enemy piece in a move to get out of check, as long as the piece is not protected. #Blocking the check. This only works if the checking piece is a queen, rook, or bishop and there is at least one empty square in the line between the checking piece and the checked king. Blocking a check is done by moving a piece to one such empty square. (The blocking piece is then pinned to the king by the attacking piece.) In the position in the first diagram, White can get out of check by any of three methods: # Capturing the attacking piece by the move Nxa2. # Moving the king to any unattacked square (marked with \\"x\\"); namely, Kd6, Ke5, or Ke7. # Blocking the check by the move Rc4 or Nd5. If a king is placed in double check, the king must get out of both checks on the following move. Since it is impossible to capture both checking pieces or block both lines of attack in a single move, a double check can be escaped only by moving the king out of check. The king itself, however, can capture one of the checking pieces or another enemy piece if it brings the king into safety. If none of these possibilities can get the king out of check, then it is checkmated and the game is lost by the checkmated player. Types of checks A simple and very common type of check is when a piece moves to directly attack the opposing king only by itself. Sometimes such a check is part of a chess tactic such as a fork, a skewer, or a discovered attack on another piece. In some cases, a check can be used to defend against such tactics. There are also a few more special types of check: *Discovered check. A discovered check is similar to any other type of discovered attack except that it is a discovered attack on the opposing king. In a discovered check, a piece moves out of the line of attack by another piece so that this other piece (which can be a queen, rook, or bishop) is then checking the opponent's king. The piece that actually moved in the discovered check move could possibly be any type of piece belonging to the same player as the checking piece except queen or the same type of piece administering the check. A discovered check could be a tactic in itself because the piece that moved could attack or otherwise create a threat to another piece on the checked king's side. The opponent has to get out of the discovered check on the following move and may not get a chance to thwart the attack by the other piece that moved. *Double check. A double check is a check from two pieces to the opponent's king in a single move. This happens when a moved piece attacks the king, resulting in a second piece giving check by discovered check. It can also happen, though very rarely, when an en passant capture opens two lines of attack simultaneously. In algebraic chess notation, a double check move is sometimes noted with a \\"++\\" after the written move in place of the usual \\"+\\", although \\"++\\" has been used to indicate checkmate (along with \\"#\\"). A double check cannot be blocked, nor can it be met by capturing one of the checking pieces (unless the king itself makes the capture), because there is check from two directions. *Cross-check. When a check is answered by a check, particularly when this second check is delivered by a piece blocking the first, it is called a cross-check. In fact, a \\"cross-checkmate\\" is also possible in that way (that is, to answer a check with a checkmate) but since no such term is in common use, it would be called cross-check as well. Announcing check and notation Until the early 20th century a player was expected to announce \\"check\\" when making a checking move, and some sources of rules even required it . This is still usually the case in friendly games. Announcing \\"check\\" is not required under the rules of chess and it is usually not done in formal games . In algebraic chess notation, a checking move is recorded like any other move, except that a \\"+\\" is normally written after the move. In the FIDE rules for rapid chess, if a player leaves their king in check or commits any other illegal move their opponent can claim a win.http://www.fide.com/component/handbook/?id=171&view;=article (accessed 22 March 2015) =Historical= Less commonly (and obsolete), the warning garde can be said when a player directly attacks the opponent's queen in a similar way. This was mostly abandoned in the 19th century . The same move can be both check and garde simultaneously. Before the queen acquired its current move (about 1495) the rook was the most powerful piece. At that time the term check-rook was used for a move that checked the king and attacked a rook at the same time . Checking in tactics and strategy Sometimes checking an opponent provides no benefit to the checking player. This is called a \\"useless check\\" and it may even provide the checked opponent with a tempo (move opportunity) to move the king into a safer position . For example, 1.e4 e6 2.d4 Bb4+? does nothing for Black and in fact causes him to lose a tempo after 3.c3! A check given with the sole intention of delaying an inevitable defeat by one move is referred to as a \\"spite check\\", and may be considered somewhat unsporting . There are many instances, however, when checking the opponent's king may be a useful tactic or part of a tactic, either in attacking or in defense. Checking is often used in combinations with many other tactics or simply to force an opponent into a position where the opposing king can be checkmated, otherwise taken advantage of, or is otherwise worse for the opponent. Some attacks involve numerous checks to force an opponent into a losing position, especially when the king is exposed. An unexpected check in a forced combination or an overlooked cross-check in a planned series of checks may serve as sort of a zwischenzug, foiling the plan. Some uses of checking: * Repetitive checking to prevent losing a game going poorly (i.e. to draw the game by perpetual check). * Royal fork (knight fork of king and queen) or other forks involving the king. * Checks to force an exchange. * A double check could be especially bad for the opponent since there are likely to be fewer options to get out of check. A double check is often more likely to lead to checkmate or loss of material. * A check might force a king to move so that it cannot castle later. * Moving a piece to give check can sometimes open a line of attack on another piece. The opponent must escape the check, and therefore cannot (in general) prevent the other piece from being captured (discovered attack). * Similarly, the piece moved to create a discovered check may attack another enemy piece, leading to the same scenario. * The king may also, by being forced to move out of check, enable the checking piece to capture another piece (an absolute skewer). * A check might force some piece to block it and therefore pose an absolute pin on that piece. * A check might deflect the king from protecting some other piece (particularly in an endgame, to capture opponent's pawns). * A check could sometimes be used to foil an opponent's trap which would otherwise lead to loss of material. For example, if an opponent forks two of a player's pieces, the attacked player may be able to move one of the forked pieces to check the opponent's king requiring the opponent to save it on his/her next move, thus allowing the player to then move the other forked piece to also save it from attack. History In early Sanskrit chess (c. 500‚Äì700) the king could be and this ended the game. The Persians (c. 700‚Äì800) introduced the idea of warning that the king was under attack (announcing check in modern terminology). This was done to avoid the early and accidental end of a game. Later the Persians added the additional rule that a king could not be moved into check or left in check. As a result, the king could not be captured . In this usage, the words \\"check\\" and \\"chess\\" come via Arabic from Persian shƒÅh, meaning \\"king\\"\\"The King Is not Dead After All!

Declaration of Assistant US Attorney Robert L. Dondero . US v. Fishman. N. D. Calif. CR-88-0616. Retrieved on 2008-05-18. Fishman's attorney, Marc Nurik, had planned to use an insanity defense, offering false memory syndrome theorist Richard Ofshe and psychologist Margaret Singer as expert witnesses. Fishman sat for a seven-part videotaped interview with Ofshe and Nurik. In the interview, he discussed in detail various aspects of Scientology doctrine, his own Scientology involvement, and the church's response to his arrest. Fishman claimed that church staff had ordered him to murder his psychologist, Uwe Geertz, who had knowledge of his Scientology involvement, and then to commit suicide. At the same time, according to Fishman, he participated in a conspiracy with church staff to deflect accusations of church involvement, by submitting fake documents and making false statements to his defense team. For these acts he was further charged with obstruction of justice. The court ultimately blocked Nurik's defense strategy by rejecting both expert witnesses, based on the testimony of opposing expert Dick Anthony. Fishman pleaded guilty to one count of mail fraud and one count of obstruction, and the court sentenced him on July 20, 1990 to five years imprisonment in the Butner Federal Correctional Institution. Fishman later claimed that the church hired Scientologist inmate Luis Martinez to kill him in prison. He was paroled in mid-1993. According to Anthony, who had opposed Ofshe and Singer, Fishman's criminal case was one of several in which they had attempted to introduce their ideas of coercive persuasion by religious groups. The court's admissibility ruling came as a setback to American critics of cults. Ofshe and Singer sued Anthony unsuccessfully, claiming that he mischaracterized the basis of their theories in this and other cases. Libel case In 1991, while Fishman was still incarcerated, Time magazine published a highly critical cover story on Scientology by Richard Behar. The story mentioned Fishman's fraud conviction and the alleged plot to eliminate him and Geertz. The church responded by filing libel lawsuits against Time Warner, Behar, and Fishman and Geertz jointly. In support of his contention that he had been brainwashed and ordered to murder Geertz, Fishman attached a series of documents to a motion to reconsider venue. This filing has since become known as the Fishman Affidavit. It included purported Scientology documents describing obstructionist tactics to use in the event of an arrest, as well as versions of Operating Thetan levels I through VII and purported excerpts of OT VIII. Fishman's filing placed the advanced materials on record at the district court, available for viewing by the general public. Despite an unsuccessful church motion to seal the court record and efforts to keep the court files continuously checked out, former Scientologist Arnaldo Lerma obtained the affidavit and posted it on the internet, after which it spread uncontrollably. In the process of suing Lerma for copyright infringement, the church confirmed that the copies of levels I through VII were accurate. A federal district court summarily dismissed the church's claims against Time Warner and Behar, finding that they had not acted with actual malice insofar as the church was concerned. The church dropped its claims against Fishman and Geertz after Geertz's legal team served subpoenas upon such Scientologist celebrities as Kelly Preston, Juliette Lewis and Isaac Hayes. The court record in the Fishman case remained open to the public. Wollersheim litigation Fishman submitted a declaration on behalf of Lawrence Wollersheim in 1993, claiming firsthand knowledge of tactics the Church had used to interfere with Wollersheim's lawsuit against the church. In the declaration (affidavit), Fishman alleged the Church had drowned the trial judge's dog and made harassing phone calls to Wollersheim at night.Appeal. Church of Scientology of California v.

Many editions of the book separate it into two volumes. Abridged editions of this work contain only the myths and leave out Graves' commentary. Overview Each myth is presented in the voice of a narrator writing under the Antonines, such as Plutarch or Pausanias, with citations of the classical sources. The literary quality of his retellings is generally praised. Following this, Graves presents his interpretation of its origin and significance, influenced by his belief in a prehistoric Matriarchal religion, as discussed in his book The White Goddess and elsewhere. Graves' theories and etymologies are rejected by most classical scholars. Graves argued in response that classical scholars lack \\"the poetic capacity to forensically examine mythology\\".The White Goddess, Farrar, Straus & Giroux, p. 224. Contents Graves interpreted Bronze Age Greece as changing from a matriarchal society under the Pelasgians to a patriarchal one under continual pressure from victorious Greek-speaking tribes. In the second stage local kings came to each settlement as foreign princes, reigned by marrying the hereditary queen, who represented the Triple Goddess, and were ritually slain by the next king after a limited period, originally six months. Kings managed to evade the sacrifice for longer and longer periods, often by sacrificing substitutes, and eventually converted the queen, priestess of the Goddess, into a subservient and chaste wife, and in the final stage had legitimate sons to reign after them. The Greek Myths presents the myths as stories from the ritual of all three stages, and often as historical records of the otherwise unattested struggles between Greek kings and the Moon-priestesses. In some cases Graves conjectures a process of \\"iconotropy\\", or image-turning, by which a hypothetical cult image of the matriarchal or matrilineal period has been misread by later Greeks in their own terms. Thus, for example, he conjectures an image of divine twins struggling in the womb of the Horse-Goddess, which later gave rise to the myth of the Trojan Horse. =Pelasgian creation myth= Jacob Bryant's Orphic Egg (1774) Graves's imaginatively reconstructed \\"Pelasgian creation myth\\" features a supreme creatrix, Eurynome, \\"The Goddess of All Things\\", who rises naked from Chaos to part sea from sky so that she can dance upon the waves. Catching the north wind at her back and rubbing it between her hands, she warms the pneuma and spontaneously generates the serpent Ophion, who mates with her. In the form of a dove upon the waves she lays the Cosmic Egg and bids Ophion to incubate it by coiling seven times around until it splits in two and hatches \\"all things that exist ... sun, moon, planets, stars, the earth with its mountains and rivers, its trees, herbs, and living creatures\\". In the soil of Arcadia the Pelasgians spring up from Ophion's teeth, scattered under the heel of Eurynome, who kicked the serpent from their home on Mount Olympus for his boast of having created all things. Eurynome, whose name means \\"wide wandering\\", sets male and female Titans for each wandering planet: Theia and Hyperion for the Sun; Phoebe and Atlas for the Moon; Metis and Coeus for Mercury; Tethys and Oceanus for Venus; Dione and Crius for Mars; Themis and Eurymedon for Jupiter; and Rhea and Cronus for Saturn. Reception Graves's retellings have been widely praised as imaginative and poetic, but the scholarship behind his hypotheses and conclusions is generally criticised as idiosyncratic and untenable.\\"The stories themselves have been presented in a lively and attractive manner, with an effect of candour and intimacy very like that of Samuel Butler's translations of Homer.\\" Review by Jay Macpherson, Phoenix, Vol. 12, No. 1. (Spring, 1958), pp. 15‚Äì25.

Times Online Ted Hughes and other poets have found the system of The White Goddess congenial; The Greek Myths contains about a quarter of that system, and does not include the method of composing poems.Graves and the Goddess, ed. Firla and Lindop, Susquehanna Univ. Press, 2003. The Greek Myths has been heavily criticised both during and after the lifetime of the author. Critics have deprecated Graves's personal interpretations, which are, in the words of one of them, \\"either the greatest single contribution that has ever been made to the interpretation of Greek myth or else a farrago of cranky nonsense; I fear that it would be impossible to find any classical scholar who would agree with the former diagnosis\\". Graves's etymologies have been questioned, and his largely intuitive division between \\"true myth\\" and other sorts of story has been viewed as arbitrary, taking myths out of the context in which we now find them. The basic assumption that explaining mythology requires any \\"general hypothesis\\", whether Graves's or some other, has also been disputed. Robin Hard, bibliographical notes to his edition of H.J.

Graves presents The Greek Myths as an updating of William Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology (originally published 1844), which Graves calls \\"the standard work in English\\", never brought up to date; Rose is dismayed to find no sign that Graves had heard of the Oxford Classical Dictionary or any of the \\"various compendia of mythology, written in, or translated into, our tongue since 1844\\". Rose finds many omissions and some clear errors, most seriously Graves's ascribing to Sophocles the argument of his Ajax (Graves ¬ß168.4); this evaluation has been repeated by other critics since.H.

In a letter to Ava Gardner, he wrote: \\"I am not a Greek scholar or an archaeologist or an anthropologist or a comparative mythologist, but I have a good nose and a sense of touch, and think I have connected a lot of mythical patterns which were not connected before, Classical faculties will hate me, and I will get a lot of sniffy reviews.\\" Editions * Robert Graves, The Greek Myths.

Cueca () is a family of musical styles and associated dances from Chile, Argentina and Bolivia. In Chile, the cueca holds the status of national dance, where it was officially declared as such by the Pinochet dictatorship on September 18, 1979.  Origins  La Zamacueca, by Manuel Antonio Caro. While cueca's origins are not clearly defined, it is considered to have mostly European Spanish and arguably indigenous influences. The most widespread version of its origins relates it with the zamacueca which arose in Peru as a variation of Spanish Fandango dancing with criollo. The dance is then thought to have passed to Chile and Bolivia, where its name was shortened and where it continued to evolve. Due to the dance's popularity in the region, the Peruvian evolution of the zamacueca was nicknamed \\"la chilena\\", \\"the Chilean\\", due to similarities between the dances. Later, after the Pacific War, the term marinera, in honor of Peru's naval combatants and because of hostile attitude towards Chile, was used in place of \\"la chilena.\\" In March 1879 the writer and musician Abelardo GamarraEl Tunante (s√°bado 8 de marzo de 1879). ¬´Cr√≥nica local - No m√°s chilenas¬ª.

The Marinera, Zamba and the Cueca styles are distinct from each other and from their root dance, the zamacueca. Another theory is that Cueca originated in the early nineteenth century bordellos of South America, as a pas de deux facilitating partner finding.Journeyman Pictures reporter Mark Corcoran's documentary with Mario Rojas and Pinochet-era victims' families on YouTube (please disregard political connotations) The usual interpretation of this courting dance is zoomorphic: it tries to reenact the courting ritual of a rooster and a hen. The male displays a quite enthusiastic and at times even aggressive attitude while attempting to court the female, who is elusive, defensive and demure. The dance often finishes with the man kneeling on one knee, with the woman placing her foot triumphantly on his raised knee. In Bolivia, there are many variations throughout the different regions. Cueca styles of La Paz, Potos√≠ and Sucre are the elegant and static versions, whereas in Cochabamba and Tarija the style is much livelier and free. The same could be said with the music where in different regions rhythm and speed slightly differ amongst the regions.

Chilean cueca is highly structured in terms of dance, lyrics and music a characteristic of early European dances of colonial times. The genre do have some aspects of Afro oriented music such as Zamacueca however, cueca is a mixture of different genres and the best of way to understand the evolution of Chilean cueca is to observe the different Spanish, European and popular dances of the time. The ar√°bigo-andaluza influence is considered the most important contribution of cueca in all aspects including, dancing, singing and tempo and is considered the primary root of the genre. See \\"Memoria Chilena, Biblioteca Nacional de Chile\\". During the second half of the nineteenth century the cueca was spread to diverse Latin American countries and the dance was known simply as the \\"chilena\\" (Chilean). In Argentina the dance was first introduced in Cuyo, which is in the central west of the country close to the border with Chile; there is documented presence of the cueca in this region in approximately 1840. Unlike in the northeast and central west of Argentina in Buenos Aires the dance was known as the \\"cueca\\" instead of the \\"chilena\\" and there is documentation of the cueca being present in Buenos Aires as early as the 1850s.

Its choreographic theme, shared with dances derived from it, was a courtship pantomime performed by a man and a woman amid a crowd that accompanied them with rhythmic clapping and supportive shouting. As the dancers advanced and retreated from each other, they rhythmically and provocatively flipped a handkerchief about. The instrumentation varied, but frequently consisted of plucked stringed instruments and a percussive instrument such as the cajon.

Cueca and Mexican music coexisted with similar levels of popularity in the Chilean countryside in the 1970s. Being distinctly Chilean the cueca was selected by the military dictatorship of Pinochet as a music to be promoted.

Cueca specialist Emilio Ignacio Santana argues that the dictatorship's appropriation and promotion of cueca harmed the genre. The dictatorship's endorsement of the genre meant according to Santana that the rich landlord huaso became the icon of the cueca and not the rural labourer. Clothing and dance The clothing worn during the cueca dance is the traditional Chilean clothes. They wear blue, white, red or black costumes and dresses. The men in the dance wear the huaso's hat, shirts, flannel poncho, riding pants and boots, short jacket, riding boots, and spurs. Women wear flowered dresses. Cueca dancing resembles a rooster-chicken relationship. The man approaches the woman and offers his arm, then the woman accompanies him and they walk around the room. They then face each other and hold their handkerchief in the air, and begin to dance. They never touch, but still maintain contact through facial expressions and movements. During the dance, the pair must wave the white handkerchief.  Basic structure Youth dance group, Santiago. The basic structure of the cueca is that it is a compound meter in or and is divided into three sections. Some differences can be noticed depending on geographical location. There are three distinct variants in addition to the traditional cueca: * The northern cueca: The main difference with this version is that there is no singing in the accompanying music which is played with only sicus, zamponas, and brass. trumpets, tubas. Also, both the music and the dance are slower. This dance is done during religious ceremonies and carnival. * The cueca from the central region: This genre is mostly seen in Chile. The guitar, accordion, guitarron, and percussion are the prevailing instruments. *The Chilo√© cueca: This form has the absence of the cuarteta. The seguidilla are repeated and there is a greater emphasis on the way the lyrics are presented by the vocalist. The cueca nowadays Currently, the cueca is mainly danced in the countryside, and performed throughout Chile each year during the national holidays in September 18 eve. Cueca tournaments are popular around that time of year. In Bolivia, Cueca styles vary by region: Cueca Pace√±a, Cueca Cochabambina, Cueca Chuquisaque√±a, Cueca Tarije√±a, Cueca Potosina y Cueca Chaque√±a. What they have in common is their rhythm, but they differ much in velocity, costumes and style. The Cueca styles of La Paz, Potos√≠ and Sucre are the elegant ones, whereas in Cochabamba and Tarija the style is much more lively. In Bolivia, it is usually called \\"Cuequita Boliviana\\" In Argentina, there are many ways of dancing Cueca. Cueca is mostly danced in the northern and western Argentine provinces of Mendoza, Chaco, Salta, Jujuy, Catamarca, La Rioja etc. Each Argentine province has its own style and way of dancing Cueca. Cueca in Tarija, Bolivia Tarija, Bolivia, has a few traditional songs which are accompanied by dances. One of which is the Cueca Tarijena. Although it may have the same name as the dances in the other departments, such as Cueca Pacena which represents La Paz, each department‚Äôs dance varies significantly. It is known for being the most upbeat, fun, and playful in comparison to the others which are more tranquil. Additionally, they were the first place to incorporate a violin into our song, thus giving it more flare and excitement. The Cueca, since its origin, has been a source of happiness for the dancers because the music is generally lively and the dances require partners to be excited about dancing with each other. The interesting thing about Cueca is that it is danced with a handkerchief, and this is how one shows affection for others. Everyone begins the dance with the handkerchief in their right hand and twirls it in circles near their shoulder and then proceeds to waive it by the left side of their waist during certain beats. During the entirety of the dance, the man is attempting to ‚Äúwin over‚Äù his partner by showing his dancing talents. The dance demonstrates how Bolivian gender roles remain quite male- dominated. Throughout most the dance, the women simply sway their hips side to side, whereas the men turn in circles and do more complicated movements. This dance is designed for women to show off their beauty and men to demonstrate their talent. The women always follow the male lead because when they are facing each other, it is up to him to decide if he‚Äôd like to flirt with his partner by putting his hanker chief near her neck and shoulders, if he‚Äôd like to hold the hanker chief behind her neck holding it with both hands, or if he doesn‚Äôt want to flirt with her, he will simply continue waiving his handkerchief near his shoulder and waist. This is the determining factor to see if they will dance together in the next part of the song, or if they would need to find other partners. Although we‚Äôre in 2018 and most places are working towards equality between women and men, this dance represents the misogyny that still exists today by letting the man choose if he likes his partner with the woman having no say about how she feels.

Early life  Courtois was born in Dijon and grew up in the prestigious surroundings of his father's workplace at the Dijon Academy. The Academy, where the family lived, was a small hotel that had been converted for scientific studies. Courtois' father, Jean-Baptiste, worked for the chemist Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau as well as for the Academy as a pharmacist and was called by his family pharmacien de l'Academie. When Courtois was twelve the family moved to the Saint-Medard Nitrary, an experimental nitrate plant which Jean-Baptiste bought from Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau and his partner.Swain, p. 103  Mid life  Courtois and his brother Pierre learned the trade of making potassium nitrate for gunpowder for the French Revolution. Courtois, however, branched off from this venture to learn chemistry. Courtois lived at Saint-Medard Nitrary until he was about eighteen, when he left his family home to begin his trade apprenticeship in chemistry in Auxerre. Here for three years he was a student of M. Fr√©my, the future grandfather of Edmond Fr√©my. He then obtained a position with Antoine-Fran√ßois de Fourcroy at the √âcole Polytechnique in Paris. In 1799 Courtois served as a pharmacist in military hospitals. In 1801 he returned to the √âcole Polytechnique to work in the laboratory of Louis Jacques Th√©nard.Swain, p. 104 In 1802, Courtois worked with Armand S√©guin at the √âcole Polytechnique on the study of opium. In conjunction with S√©guin, Courtois isolated morphine, the first known alkaloid, from opium. S√©guin presented his first memoir on opium to the French Institute in 1804.Swain, p. 105 L. G. Toraude adds a note at the end of the biography of Courtois: S√©guin's and Courtois' opium research came to an end at the √âcole Polytechnique in 1804. Courtois then went to his father's business in Paris for making potassium nitrate. By 1805 his father's business was failing and he was put in debtors' prison until the end of 1807. Courtois managed the family business meanwhile until his father was released. No details are known of the demise of Courtois' father after his release. Courtois is recorded as a Parisian businessman in 1806 as a salp√™trier. In 1808 Courtois married the daughter of a Parisian hairdresser. Records show he continued to operate the family saltpeter factory until 1821, with the possible exception of years 1815, 1816, and 1817.Swain, p. 107 By 1811 the Napoleonic Wars had made the government-controlled saltpeter business taper off since there was by then a shortage of wood ashes with which potassium nitrate was made. As an alternative, the needed potassium nitrate was derived from seaweed that was abundant on the Normandy and Brittany shores. The seaweed also had another, yet undiscovered, important chemical. One day towards the end of 1811 while Courtois was isolating sodium and potassium compounds from seaweed ash, he discovered iodine after he added sulfuric acid to the seaweed ash.Swain, p. 108 He was investigating corrosion of his copper vessels when he noticed a vapor given off. It was in the form of an unusual purple vapor. Humphry Davy later records  Later life  Courtois was acknowledged by Humphry Davy and Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac as the true discoverer of iodine. He went into manufacturing high-quality iodine and its salts in 1822. In 1831 he was awarded 6,000 francs as part of the Montyon Prize by L'Academie royale des sciences for the medicinal value of this element. He struggled financially for the rest of his life and died 27 September 1838. He was 62 years old and had no assets left for his widow or son.Swain, p. 109 In the year of his death, the Journal de chimie m√©dicale drily noted his passing under the heading Obituary as: > \\"Bernard Courtois, the discoverer of iodine, died at Paris the 27th of > September, 1838, leaving his widow without fortune. If, on making this > discovery, Courtois had taken out a certificate of invention, he would have > realized a large estate.\\" as translated by  Notes   References  * Swain, Patricia, Bernard Courtois (1777‚Äì1838), famed for discovering iodine (1811), and his life in Paris from 1798 * Toraude, L.

It was the dominant Baroque culture and ideology of the nobility (szlachta) that existed in times of the Renaissance to the 18th centuries.Kresin, O. Sarmatism Ukrainian. Ukrainian History Together with another concept of \\"Golden Liberty\\", it formed a central aspect of the Commonwealth's culture and society. At its core was the unifying belief that the people of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth descended from the ancient Iranian Sarmatians, the legendary invaders of contemporary Polish lands in antiquity.Tadeusz Sulimirski, The Sarmatians (New York: Praeger Publishers 1970) at 167.P. M. Barford, The Early Slavs (Ithaca: Cornell University 2001) at 28. The term and culture were reflected primarily in 17th- century Polish literature, as in Jan Chryzostom Pasek's memoirs,Pamiƒôtniki Jana Chryzostoma Paska [1690s] (Poznan 1836), translated by C. S. Leach as 'Memoirs of the Polish Baroque. The Writings of Jan Chryzostom Pasek (University of California 1976). and the poems of Wac≈Çaw Potocki. The Polish gentry wore a long fur trimmed coat, called kontusz, knee-high boots, and carried a small saber (szabla) called karabela. Mustaches were also popular, as well as decorative feathers in men's headgear. Poland's \\"Sarmatians\\" strove to achieve martial skill on horseback, believed in equality among themselves (\\"Golden Freedom\\"), and in invincibility in the face of the enemy.Simon Schama, Landscape and Memory Vintage, New York, 1995:38. Sarmatism lauded past victories of the Polish military, and required Polish noblemen to cultivate the tradition. Sarmatia (in Polish, Sarmacja) was a semi-legendary, poetic name for Poland that was fashionable into the 18th century, and which designated qualities associated with the literate citizenry of the vast Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. Sarmatism greatly affected the culture, lifestyle and ideology of the Polish nobility. It was unique for its cultural mix of Eastern, Western and native traditions. Sarmatism considerably influenced the noble cultures of other contemporary states‚ÄîCossack Hetmanate, Moldavia, Transylvania, Serbian Despotate, Habsburg Hungary and Croatia, Wallachia and Muscovy. Criticized during the Polish Enlightenment, Sarmatism was rehabilitated by the generations that embraced Polish Romanticism. Having survived the literary realism of Poland's \\"Positivist\\" period, Sarmatism made a comeback with The Trilogy of Henryk Sienkiewicz, Poland's first Nobel laureate in literature (1905). Concept origin and its general idea The term Sarmatism was first used by Jan D≈Çugosz in his 15th century work on the history of Poland.Andrzej Wasko, Sarmatism or the Enlightenment: The Dilemma of Polish Culture, Sarmatian Review XVII.2. D≈Çugosz was also responsible for linking the Sarmatians to the prehistory of Poland and this idea was continued by other chroniclers and historians such as Stanis≈Çaw Orzechowski, Marcin Bielski, Marcin Kromer, and Maciej Miechowita. Miechowita's Tractatus de Duabus Sarmatiis became influential abroad, where for some time it was one of the most widely used reference works on the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. The idea appeared due to the humanists' romantic admiration of Antiquity and an attempt to return an outdated onomastics. According to the Geography by Ptolemy, Sarmatia was considered to be territory of Poland, Lithuania, and Tartary and consisted of Asian and European parts divided by the Don River. As a geographical term, Sarmatia was always indistinct, but very stable. The presumed ancestors of the szlachta, the Sarmatians, were a confederacy of predominantly Iranian tribes living north of the Black Sea. In the 5th century BC Herodotus wrote that these tribes were descendants of the Scythians and Amazons. The Sarmatians were infiltrated by the Goths and others in the 2nd century AD, and may have had some strong and direct links to Poland.T. Sulimirski, The Sarmatians' (New York: Praeger 1970) at 166‚Äì167, 194, 196 (Sarmatian-Polish links). See below. The legend of Polish descent from Sarmatians stuck and grew until most of those within the Commonwealth, and many abroad, believed that many Polish nobles were somehow descendants of the Sarmatians (Sauromates). Another tradition came to surmise that the Sarmatians themselves were descended from Japheth, son of Noah.Colin Kidd, British Identities before Nationalism; Ethnicity and Nationhood in the Atlantic World, 1600‚Äì1800, Cambridge University Press, 1999, p. 29 Sarmatians, westernmost of the Iranian peoples, ca.100 BC Some holding to Sarmatism tended to believe that their ancestors had conquered and enserfed the local Slavs and, like the Bulgars in Bulgaria or Franks who conquered Gaul (France), eventually adopted the local language. Such nobility might believe that they belonged (at least figuratively) to a different people than the Slavs whom they ruled. \\"Roman maps, fashioned during the Renaissance, had the name of Sarmatia written over most of the territory of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, and thus 'justified' interest in 'Sarmatian roots'.\\"Iwo Cyprian Pogonowski, Poland. An illustrated history (New York: Hippocrene 2003) at 73. Centuries later, modern scholarship discovered evidence showing that the Alans, a late Sarmatian people speaking an Iranian idiom, did invade Slavic tribes in Eastern Europe before the sixth century, and that these \\"Sarmatians evidently formed the area's ruling class, which was gradually Slavicized.\\"T. Sulimirski, The Sarmatians (1970) at 26, 196. Sulimirski (at 196n11, 212) footnotes to G. Vernadsky and others. Their direct political connection to Poland, however, would remain somewhat uncertain.Cf., George Vernadsky, Ancient Russia (New Haven: Yale University 1943) at 78‚Äì90, 129‚Äì137. \\"[T]he Alans struck deeper roots in Russia, and entered into closer cooperation with the natives‚Äîespecially with the Slavs‚Äîthan any other migratory tribe. It was, as we know, by the Alanic clans that the Slavic tribes of the Antes were organized.\\" Vernadsky (1943) at 135. In his 1970 publication The Sarmatians (in the series \\"Ancient Peoples and Places\\") Tadeusz Sulimirski (1898‚Äì1983), an Anglo-Polish historian, archaeologist, and researcher on the ancient Sarmatians, discusses the abundant evidence of the ancient Sarmatian presence in Eastern Europe, e.g., the finds of various grave goods such as pottery, weapons, and jewelry. Possible ethnological and social influences on the Polish szlachta would include tamga-inspired heraldry, social organization, military practices, and burial customs.T. Sulimirski, The Sarmatians' (1970) at 151‚Äì155 (Tamghas); at 166‚Äì167 (pottery, spear heads, other grave goods; tamgha-inspired heraldry), at 194‚Äì196 (jewelry, tribal authority). Poles tracing their descent to the Sarmatians was part of wider tendency evident all over Europe, of various peoples tracing their descent to an ancient people who had lived in their country in Roman times: the Dutch taking up the Batavians as their forebears, the French - the Gauls, the Portuguese - the Lusitanians, the Scots - the Caledonians, the Swiss - the Helvetii, the Romanians - the Dacians, etc. Culture and fashion Sarmatian belief and customs became an important part of szlachta culture, penetrating all aspects of life. Sarmatism enshrined equality among all szlachta, and celebrated their life style and traditions, including horseback riding, provincial village life, peace and relative pacifism. In the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, in which the Sejm resisted and vetoed most royal proposals for war; for some examples and discussion, see 2000. Especially Pp. 9‚Äì11, 114, 181, 323. See also democratic peace theory. It popularised Eastern (almost oriental) clothing and looks, such as the ≈ºupan, kontusz, sukmana, pas kontuszowy, delia, and szabla. Thereby it served to integrate the multiethnic nobility by creating an almost nationalist sense of unity and pride in the szlachta's political Golden Freedoms. It also differentiated the Polish szlachta from Western nobility (which szlachta called pludracy, a reference to their hose, an item of clothing not worn by the szlachta but popular among Westerners). Politically influential El≈ºbieta Sieniawska, in Sarmatist pose and male delia coat Sarmatists strongly valued social and family ties. Women were treated with honour and gallantry. Conversation was one of the favourite preoccupations. Guests were always welcomed ‚Äì relatives, friends, even strangers, especially from abroad. Latin was widely spoken. Sumptuous feasts with large amount of alcohol were organised. Male quarrels and fighting during such events was quite common. At their parties the polonaise, mazurka, and oberek were the most popular dances. Honour was of prime relevance. Marriage was described as ‚Äòdeep friendship‚Äô. Men often travelled a lot (to the Sejms, Sejmiki, indulgences, law courts, or common movements). Women stayed at home and took care of the property, livestock and children. Although large numbers of children were born, many of them died before reaching maturity. Girls and boys were brought up separately, either in the company of women or men. Suing, even for relatively irrelevant matters, was common, but in most cases a compromise was reached. Funeral ceremonies in Sarmatist Poland were very elaborate, with some distinctive features compared to other parts of Europe. They were carefully planned events, full of ceremony and splendour. Elaborate preparations were made in the period between a nobleman's death and his funeral, which employed a large number of craftsmen, architects, decorators, servants and cooks. Sometimes many months passed before all the preparations were completed. Before the burial, the coffin with the corpse was placed in a church amid the elaborate architecture of the castrum doloris (\\"castle of mourning\\"). Heraldic shields, which were placed on the sides of the coffin, and a tin sheet with an epitaph served a supplementary role and provided information about the deceased person. Religious celebrations were usually preceded by a procession which ended in the church. It was led by a horseman who played the role of the deceased nobleman and wore his armour. This horseman would enter the church and fall off his horse with a tremendous bang and clank, showing in this way the triumph of death over earthly might and knightly valour. Some funeral ceremonies lasted for as long as four days, ending with a wake which had little to do with the seriousness of the situation, and could easily turn into sheer revelry. Occasionally an army of clergy took part in the burial (in the 18th century, 10 bishops, 60 canons and 1705 priests took part in the funeral of one Polish nobleman). Some Polish nobles felt that their supposed Sarmatian ancestors were a Turkic people and accordingly viewed their Turkish and Crimean Tatar enemies as peers, albeit ones who were unredeemed because they were not Christians. Many Sarmatists believed that the Slavs whom they ruled (whether Polish-speaking Roman Catholic or Ruthenian-speaking Orthodox) were backward. This ideology placed the Polish followers of Sarmatism at odds with the later Russian pan-Slavists. Dan D.Y. Shapira. (2009) \\"Turkism\\", Polish Sarmatism and Jewish Szlachta Some reflections on a cultural context of the Polish-Lithuanian Karaites Karadeniz Arastirmalari pp. 29‚Äì43 Commonwealth armies during this period, of course, were regularly at war with the Ottoman Empire; any military advantages demonstrated by their foes, the Poles naturally copied. Also, during the Baroque era in Poland, the art and furnishings of the Persians and the Chinese, as well as the Ottomans, were admired and displayed.Adam Zamoyski, The Polish Way (New York: Hippocrene 1987) at 163‚Äì164 (Black Sea frontier), 187 (1683 Battle of Vienna), 196 (weapons, tactics, insignia); at 198 (the Baroque arts). In accordance with their views on their supposed Turkic origins, Sarmatists' costume stood out from that worn by the noblemen of other European countries, and had its roots in the Orient. It was long, dignified, rich and colourful. One of its most characteristic elements was the kontusz, which was worn with the decorative kontusz belt. Underneath, the ≈ºupan was worn, and over the ≈ºupan the delia. Clothes for the mightiest families were crimson and scarlet. The szarawary were typical lower-body clothing, and the calpac, decorated with heron's feathers, was worn on the head. French fashions, however, also contributed to the Sarmatian look in Polish attire.C. S. Leach, \\"Introduction\\" at xliii‚Äìxliv, in Memoirs of the Polish Baroque (Berkeley: University of California 1976). Political thought and institutions hajduk guards. Karol Stanis≈Çaw Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç, the most prominent nobleman of his times and a representative of Sarmatism. Adherents of Sarmatism acknowledged the vital importance of Poland since it was considered an oasis of the Golden Liberty for Polish nobility, otherwise surrounded by antagonistic realms with absolutist governments. They also viewed Poland as the bulwark of true Christendom, almost surrounded by the Muslim Ottoman Empire, and by the errant Christianity of the Orthodox Russians and the Protestant Germans and Swedes. What contemporary Polish historians consider to be one of the most essential features of this tradition is not Sarmatist ideology, but the manner in which the Rzeczpospolita was governed. The democratic concepts of law and order, self-government and elective offices constituted an inseparable part of Sarmatism. Yet it was democracy only for the few. The king, though elected, still held the central position in the state, but his power was limited by various legal acts and requirements. Moreover, only the nobles were given political rights, namely the vote in the Sejmik and the Sejm. Every pose≈Ç (or member of the Sejm), had the right to exercise a so-called liberum veto, which could block the passage of a proposed new resolution or law. Finally, in the event that the king failed to abide by the laws of the state, or tried to limit or question nobles‚Äô privileges, they had the right to refuse the king's commands, and to oppose him by force of arms. Although thus avoiding absolutist rule, unfortunately the central state power became precarious, and vulnerable to anarchy.Among the urgent reforms then required in Poland were \\"a stable government, well ordered finances, and an army comparable with that of her neighbors.\\" Oscar Halecki, A History of Poland (New York: Roy 1942; 9th ed., New York: David McKay 1976) at 191. The political system of the Rzeczpospolita was regarded by the nobility as the best in the world, and the Polish Sejm as (factuallyCronicae et gesta ducum sive principum Polonorum) the oldest. The system was frequently compared to Republican Rome and to the Greek polis ‚Äì though each of these eventually surrendered to imperial rule or to tyrants. The Henrician Articles were considered to be the foundation of the system. Every attempt to infringe on these laws was treated as a great crime. Yet despite fruits of golden age Poland and the Sarmatist culture, the country would enter a period of national decline; it brought in a narrow cultural conformity.Cf., Oscar Halecki, A History of Poland (New York: Roy 1942; 9th ed., New York: David McKay 1976) at 183‚Äì184 (Protestant disabilities). Nonetheless, a crippling political anarchy came to reign, due to cynical use of the free veto by individual szlachta in the Sejm,Norman Davies, A History of Poland. Volume I. The Origins to 1795 (New York: Columbia University 1984) at 367. and/or to the acts of unpatriotic kings.Pawel Jasienica, The Commonwealth of Both Nations (New York: Hippocrene 1987) at 335, 338.

Religion Original act of the Warsaw Confederation 1573, the first act of religious freedom in Europe ‚ÄúCertainly, the wording and substance of the declaration of the Confederation of Warsaw of 28 January 1573 were extraordinary with regard to prevailing conditions elsewhere in Europe, and they governed the principles of religious life in the Republic for over two hundred years.‚Äù ‚Äì Norman DaviesNorman Davies, God's Playground.

The right to worship freely was a basic right given to all inhabitants of the Commonwealth throughout the 15th and early 16th centuries, and complete freedom of religion was officially recognized in Poland in 1573 during the Warsaw Confederation. Poland maintained its religious freedom laws during an era when religious persecution was an everyday occurrence in the rest of Europe.Zamoyski, Adam. The Polish Way. New York: Hippocrene Books, 1987 The Commonwealth of Poland was a place where the most radical religious sects, trying to escape persecution in other countries of the Christian world, sought refuge.http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php- URL_ID=23126&URL;_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL;_SECTION=201.html > \\"This country became a place of shelter for heretics‚Äù ‚Äì Cardinal Hozjusz > papal legate to Poland.http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php- > URL_ID=23126&URL;_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL;_SECTION=201.html In the sphere of religion, Catholicism was the dominant faith and heavily emphasized because it was seen as differentiating the Polish Sarmatists from their Turkish and Tatar peers. Providence and the grace of God were often emphasized. All earthly matters were perceived as a means to a final goal ‚Äì Heaven. Penance was stressed as a means of saving oneself from eternal punishment. It was believed that God watches over everything and everything has its meaning. People willingly took part in religious life: masses, indulgences and pilgrimages. Special devotion was paid to Saint Mary, the saints and the Passion. Sarmatist art and writings Polonaise (painting by Kornelli Szlegel) Art was treated by Sarmatists as propagandistic in function: its role was to immortalise a good name for the family, extolling the virtues of ancestors and their great deeds. Consequently, personal or family portraits were in great demand. Their characteristic features were realism, variety of colour and rich symbolism (epitaphs, coats of arms, military accessories). People were usually depicted against a subdued, dark background, in a three-quarter view. Sarmatist culture was portrayed especially by: * Wac≈Çaw Potocki * Jan Chryzostom Pasek * Wespazjan Kochowski * Andrzej Zbylitowski * Hieronim Morsztyn * Jan Andrzej Morsztyn * Daniel Naborowski * Justus Ludwik Decjusz Latin was very popular and often mixed with the Polish language in macaronic writings and in speech. Knowing at least some Latin was an obligation for any szlachcic. In the 19th century the Sarmatist culture of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth was portrayed and popularised by Henryk Sienkiewicz in his trilogy (Ogniem i Mieczem, Potop, Pan Wolodyjowski). In the 20th century, Sienkiewicz's trilogy was filmed, and Sarmatist culture became the subject of many modern books (by Jacek Komuda and others), songs (like that of Jacek Kaczmarski) and even role-playing games like Dzikie Pola. Barbara Lubomirska, 1676. One of the most distinctive art forms of the Sarmatists were the coffin portraits, a form of portraiture characteristic of Polish Baroque painting, not to be found anywhere else in Europe. The octagonal or hexagonal portraits were fixed to the headpiece of the coffin so that the deceased person, being a Christian with an immortal soul, was always represented as alive and capable of holding a dialogue with mourners during lavish funeral celebrations. Such portraits were props which evoked the illusion of the dead person's presence, and also a ritual medium that provided a link between the living and those departing for eternity. The few surviving portraits, often painted during a person's lifetime, are a dependable source of information about 17th-century Polish nobility. The dead were depicted either in their official clothes or in travelling garb, since death was believed to be a journey into the unknown. The oldest known coffin portrait in Poland is that depicting Stefan Batory, dating from the end of the 16th century. Many of the szlachta residences were wooden mansionsSee houses in Poland. Numerous palaces and churches were built in Sarmatist Poland. There was a trend towards native architectural solutions which were characterised by Gothic forms and unique stucco ornamentation of vaults. Gravestones were erected in churches for those who had rendered considerable services for the motherland. Tens of thousands of manor houses were built, the majority of wood (pine, fir and larch). At the entrance there was a porch. The central place where visitors were received was a large entrance hall. In the manor house there was an intimate part for women, and a more public one for men. Manor houses often had corner annexes. Walls were adorned with portraits of ancestors, mementos and spoils. Few of the manor houses from the Old Polish period have survived, but their tradition was continued in the 19th and 20th century. Modern usage In contemporary Polish, the word \\"Sarmatian\\" (Polish: Sarmata- when used as noun, sarmacki- when used as adjective) is a form of ironic self-identification, and is sometimes used as a synonym for the Polish character. A scholarly journal on Poland, central and eastern Europe, has recently been launched by Polish-Americans, published at Rice University and called the Sarmatian Review. Impact on other peoples within the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth Lithuanians and Ukrainians living within the Commonwealth also adopted certain aspects of Sarmatism. Compare: Some Lithuanian historians of that time claimed that their people were descended from Scythians who had settled in ancient Rome, which had become the home of their pagan high priest. Ukrainians of that time claimed descent from Sarmatians or from a related tribe, the Roxolani. They also claimed descent from the Turkic Khazars. For example, the Constitution of Pylyp Orlyk of 1711 (also known as Bender Constitution) included the following declarations: \\"the valiant and ancient Cossack people, formerly called Khazar, was at first exalted by immortal glory...so much so that the Eastern Emperor...joined his son in matrimony to the daughter of the Khagan, that is to say, the Cossack prince\\"; \\"...the Orthodox faith of the Eastern confession, with which the valiant Cossack people was enlightened under the rule of Khazar princes by the Apostolic See of Constantinople...\\"; \\"whereas the people formerly known as the Khazars and later called Cossacks trace their genealogical origin to the powerful and invincible Goths...and join together that Cossack people by the deepest ties of affectionate affinity to the Crimean state...\\". Tatars who had settled in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth and were loyal to the Polish state were viewed by Polish followers of Sarmatism as peers. Accordingly, they enjoyed the privileges of Polish nobility and freedom to practice their Muslim faith. These Tatars, in spite of their Muslim faith, were more easily accepted into Polish society than were Orthodox Christian Ukrainians whose supposed Sarmatian origins were more questionable. Evaluation Some have criticised the development of Sarmatism, saying that while it initially supported religious belief, national pride, equality and freedom, over time this was perverted into a form of beliefs conducive to intolerance and fanaticism. Sarmatism, which evolved during the Polish Renaissance and entrenched itself during the Polish baroque, found itself opposed to the ideology of the Polish Enlightenment. By the late 18th century the word 'Sarmatism' had gained negative associations and the concept was frequently criticized and ridiculed in political publications such as Monitor, where it became a synonym for uneducated and unenlightened ideas and a derogatory term for those who opposed the reforms of the 'progressives' such as the king, Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski. The ideology of Sarmatism became a target for ridicule, as seen in Franciszek Zab≈Çocki's play \\"Sarmatism\\" (Sarmatyzm, 1785). To a certain degree the process was reversed during the period of Polish Romanticism, when after the partitions of Poland memory of the old Polish Golden Age rehabilitated old traditions to a certain extent. Particularly in the aftermath of the November Uprising, when the genre of gawƒôda szlachecka (\\"a nobleman's tale\\") created by Henryk Rzewuski gained popularity, Sarmatism was often portrayed positively in literature. Such treatment of the concept can also be seen in Polish messianism and in works of great Polish poets like Adam Mickiewicz (Pan Tadeusz), Juliusz S≈Çowacki and Zygmunt Krasi≈Ñski, as well as writers (Henryk Sienkiewicz and his Trylogia), as well as others. This close connection between Polish Romanticism and Polish history became one of the defining qualities of this literary period, differentiating it from other contemporary literature, which did not suffer from a lack of national statehood as was the case with Poland.

After their formation, they soon became Pakistan's first and most commercially successful as well as critically acclaimed act. The band's popular lineup consisted of keyboardist Rohail Hyatt, bassist Shahzad Hasan, guitarist Nusrat Hussain and vocalist Junaid Jamshed. Rooted in Rawalpindi with some influence from Western music during the conservative regime of President Zia-ul-Haq, the Vital Signs utilizes several genres, ranging from pop music to rock, and often incorporating classical and other elements in innovative ways. In the early 1990s, they came to be perceived by many Pakistani fans and country's cultural observers as a \\"promising new era of cultural revival\\". Their enormous popularity significantly opened a new wave of music and a modern chapter in the history of Pakistan. The band built its reputation playing in university campuses and underground rock music concerts held in different parts of the country, before being noticed by PTV performing art section director Shoaib Mansoor. The band initially gained national prominence and popularity from their music video of their single \\"Dil Dil Pakistan\\" first aired on PTV. Written by Shaoib Mansoor, the song became a big commercial hit and critically acclaimed in the public; it was voted, in an unscientific poll as the third most popular song of all time by BBC World.BBC, The World's Top Ten Retrieved on 21 November 2009 By the early 1990s, the band members had become public celebrities and international stars in the midst of the 1990s. From the 1980s to the 1990s, they produced many of their highly successful and critically praised albums, what many cultural critics consider their finest material including the innovative and widely influential albums, Vital Signs 1 (1989), Vital Signs 2 (1991), Aitebar (1993) and Hum Tum (1995). The success of their second album marked the international prominence of the band, first traveling to the United States to perform, becoming the first Pakistani music act to go abroad on a tour. After the disintegrating and fading of the band in 1998, they each enjoyed successful musical careers. Leading singer Junaid Jamshed went on to pursue a career as a solo singer and as an Islamic televangelist, Shahzad Hasan concentrated on his work as a music producer and Rohail Hyatt formed a production company. The Vital Signs is considered one of the most successful bands in Pakistan, having influenced many of the pop groups & rock bands originating from the country. History =Early years and formation (1983‚Äì1986)= The band was formed in early 1983 by two Peshawar University classmates, keyboardist Rohail Hyatt and bassist Shahzad Hassan, in Rawalpindi, Punjab Province of Pakistan, though no names of the band reached consensus. In 1983, the band started playing rock gigs at the local university campus, working with various unknown singers. The band came in contact with Jamshed after spotting him performing rock music gig in Peshawar University and Islamabad University campuses while as a student at UET in Lahore. In 1986, Hyatt and Hassan officially formed the band after recruiting Nusrat Hussain as lead guitarist. The band began practicing by playing covers of Deep Purple, Eagles, Nazia and Zoheb, and Led Zeppelin in the early 1980s, and they made a name for themselves by playing in local five star hotels. As early as 1986‚Äì87, the band began looking for a lead vocalist, often going to local concerts to look for the singers. The band once again met with Junaid Jamshed after the band played with Jamshed at the Marriott hotel in Islamabad in 1987. Since 1983, Hyatt had wanted to recruit Jamshed as the band's lead singer, but was unable to do so when Jamshed left for Peshawar shortly. In 1987, Jamshed joined his engineering university's rock band, Nuts and Bolt, as a lead vocalist and performed at Flashman's Hotel in Rawalpindi. While Jamshed was performing, Nusrat Hussain, and Rohail Hyatt also went to the concert in search of new talent at the hotel. When Jamshed came to perform at the stage, Nusrat had tipped Hyatt off with a \\"that kid's coming back; the guy you liked\\" and that \\"perhaps we should go and see him.\\" Hussain urged Hyatt to see him and after Jamshed's performance; they did and Junaid joined their band. A former band member Junaid Siddiqui was also added to the group to play drums for the hit music video \\"Dil Dil Pakistan.\\" At the concert, Hyatt patiently waited for the concert to be over as it stretched on until midnight. The show lasted till 3:00 am because people wouldn't leave, which was unheard of in Islamabad, where people packed up at 10:00pm. Junaid was immediately hired as the band's lead singer and got an offer for a show to open for a band called String Fellow. The promoter asked for a name of the band and during this time, the band had not reached an official name, just a group of four guys. Shahi attributes the name of band to when his older sister, who had just gone to medical university, told them: \\"This term of how you check the vital signs of life in a person\\". Hyatt immediately took the suggestion and named them \\"Vital Signs\\" for the first time since its formation.. Using 'Vital Signs' for the band's name was further reinforced because it was also the name of hit album Vital Signs by Survivor which was one of the influences of the band. =Rise to fame and recognition (1987‚Äì1989)= In mid-1985, the Western-influenced rock music began to be noticed by the public and underground concerts were held all over the country. The rock music jolted the country in a time when the ultra-conservative regime of President General Zia-ul-Haq was reigning supreme as dictator masquerading as \\"democratically elected\\". The President with a puppet parliament sanctioning his every move reeked of a Machiavellian brand of so-called \\"Islamisation.\\" President Zia-ul-Haq had famously and strongly denounced \\"western ideas\\" such as jeans and rock music. Various groups had garnered and gotten the attention of the public, and the rock music naturally got appreciated as it was out of the ordinary. It was these political and economic tensions and pretensions, heavy metal power plays and the economic prosperity that also propelled the gradual expansion of the country's urban middle and lower-middle-classes. According to the leftist cultural critic, Nadeem F. Paracha: \\"The youth culture at that emerged from these classes that launched the first shots of the kind of pop culture, scene and music we now call modern Pakistani pop and rock.\\" In mid-1986, Benazir Bhutto returned to the country and organised a mammoth rally that weakened the conservative President Zia-ul-Haq. The country's major urban music media centres saw a quiet but certain outpouring of brand new rock bands who wanted to sound somewhat different from the time's top pop-rock scions. Around 1985‚Äì87, the band gained national recognition and was offered a music video, by Rana Kanwal who was a producer at the PTV Studio. For PTV Studios, the bands had gone head-to-head into a competition for whoever made the best video, and the winner would play on all the networks across Pakistan. She called Rohail Hyatt and asked the band to compose the classical poem of Parveen Shakir into a rock music video. But unlike their other young contemporaries, Vital Signs performances included ambitious and bold cover songs of famous western bands like Pink Floyd, Rush and a-ha, apart from the usual popular Pakistani film-pop music at that time. In 1987, the band released its very first single \\"Do Pal Ka Jeevan\\", which became an ultimate success and the band built its reputation in Pakistan's underground music industry. =Breakthrough era (1989‚Äì1991)= The success of their first single made Vital Signs much more popular, and they were soon discovered by famous PTV music producer and film director Shoaib Mansoor at the local concert, who was impressed with Vital Signs' \\"Do Pal Ka Jeevan\\" single. The next day, Mansoor called the band and asked them to do a national song which would go on-air all over the country. Written by Shoaib Mansoor and composed by Hyatt, the song which was named \\"Dil Dil Pakistan\\" became a huge success, much shocking Hyatt. It was released in the summer of 1987 as a video directed by Shoaib Mansoor, in which the Vital Signs are shown singing the song over what looked like the lush hills of Murree. It was an instant hit and later was voted as the third most popular song of all time by BBC World. However, the allure of instant success and the amount of interest Shoaib was ready to invest in the band kept Rohail and Shahzad going and convinced Junaid to hang around for at least the recording of their first album. The band lead guitarist, Nusrat Hussain, left the band and suggested Rohail Hyatt to bring Salman Ahmad as his replacement. Inspired by a song in Rush's album Moving Pictures, Nusrat Hussain initially composed music for the guitar in the song, but was rejected by Shoaib Mansoor at the very first draft as he wanted it to be catchier. Nusrat gave it another go and came up with an intro that was appreciated by the other members. Encouraged by it, especially by Junaid Jamshed, they provided their own inputs and ideas until they completed the tune, Shoaib approved it, and Hyatt composed the music and recorded it. Shoaib's clout got EMI Pakistan studio interested in helping the band record their debut album. This saw Rohail, Junaid and Shahzad traveling to Karachi. The album was recorded at EMI's studio, but almost all of it was written and composed at Salman Ahmad's residence where the band had been lodged. Shoaib did all the lyrics while Junaid and Rohail composed the songs. =Continued success (1989‚Äì1992)= With the release of their first major single, Vital Signs began to achieve recognition in Pakistan. Their debut album, Vital Signs 1, was a success leading a wave of fresh new acts in the country. Most of the new acts were part of the many \\"youth festivals\\" that began to do the rounds in Karachi and Lahore, especially after one such show was specially conducted and televised by PTV in late 1989. Shoaib Mansoor also directed a mini-drama, Dhundle Raste, about the true story of the band, in which the band members acted as themselves. The band soon went on a tour throughout the country, playing sell-out concerts in Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad and Peshawar. Some of these, especially the two concerts held in Karachi in late 1989, were among the best concerts by the band. Salman Ahmad wanted a change in the band's music and by the time the band was approached by Pepsi in December 1990, Rohail decided to isolate Salman from the band and thus he left to form his own band, Junoon. Pressured by Pepsi to come out with a brand new album, the band then replaced Salman with Rizwan-ul-Haq as their new lead guitarist. In 1991, the band released their second album Vital Signs 2. The album was a departure from the first album's more upbeat ways. The resulting sound emerging from such emotional turmoil and uncertainty was heavily melancholic and introverted (\\"Rahi\\", \\"Yaad Kerna\\"), suddenly jumping towards thumping anger with the powerful, \\"Aisa Na Ho\\". This was perhaps the most political album by the band. The album had more maturity, versatility and was a commercial success. This led the band to perform in the United States on a tour, thus making them the very first pop act to do so. The tour also changed the way the band looked, and the band saw the emergence of grunge and a revival of interest in '70s music, and became instigators of fashion. The change also saw Rohail, Shahzad and Junaid moving to Karachi (Rizwan decided to stay back in Islamabad), as Rohail started constructing a brand new studio in his Karachi apartment. After performing a number of concerts managed by Rohail's elder brother Zahid, the group headed out with director Shoaib Mansoor to film Guitar '93, a Pepsi-financed venture featuring videos shot all across Pakistan. = Aetibar and Greatest Hits (1993‚Äì1995) = After the departure of Salman Ahmad, Hyatt's childhood friend Rizwan-ul-Haq was asked to join the band as lead guitarist. Rizwan, an electrical engineer, left Islamabad for Karachi to join the band and the Signs began work on their third album in Rohail Hyatt's studios, Pyramid Studios, in 1993. The third album Aitebar, which soon outsold its predecessor, Vital Signs 2, was an ultimate success. The Signs then started their nationwide tour and collaborated with Shoaib Mansoor who directed \\"Guitar '93, a compilation of videos of Vital Signs' biggest hits thus far. It shot across the four provinces and was financed by Pepsi Pakistan Inc. Made for PTV, Guitar '93 was an entertaining document of the band's progress as one of the best pop/rock acts in Pakistan. With the release of Guitar'93, it was Rizwan who gained a lot of publicity and notability, and Signs also played their highest number of concerts in 1993. The biggest took place at the KMC Stadium in Karachi, a mega-concert headlined by the Signs and also consisting of performances from The Milestones, Awaz and the newly formed rock band, Arsh. Former member Salman Ahmad was present in the audience. It was after this concert Rohail first started to show signs of agitation regarding his growing dissatisfaction with Rizwan-ul-Haq's playing and his expenses. The success of Aetibar and Guitar'93 marked a great opportunity for Signs. The Signs marked its very first international tour to US in 1993, becoming the first Pakistan musical act to do so. =Hum Tum (1995) and world tours= In 1994, the band did not extend the contract for its guitarist, Rizwan-ul-Haq, despite his urgings. Rizwan was relieved and \\"shown the door\\" after which Hyatt chose technical guitar whiz Aamir Zaki to become the band's new lead guitarist. The Signs made its second tour to the United States with Zaki on board as the band's lead guitarist. Soon returning, the band started to work on their fourth and final installment, Hum Tum. Zaki was given the impression he was joining the band as a full member, not a session player, but was asked to leave after recording just three songs of the album. In a book, \\"Personal Biography\\" on Signs published online, Zaki had serious disagreement with the band leader, Hyatt, on the direction the band was taking. Hyatt later stated that the predominant reason was because Aamir Zaki had criticized David Gilmour's guitar-playing while the band was touring the UK and attending a Pink Floyd concert. Hyatt famously quoted: \\"That's ridiculous! That's one person's (Aamir's) opinion. You don't fight or drop out of bands because of that.\\" Following the departure of Zaki, the Signs quickly hired Awaz band member, Asad Ahmed, as the band's lead guitarist who would play at the UK concerts. In a turmoil situation, Hyatt soon left the Signs clashing with lead singer Junaid and bassist Shahi over a contractual obligation the band had for a series of concerts in the US, after Zaki joined the Signs for a US tour. Rohail Hyatt then also went on to start a music magazine called Vibes. =Upheaval and break-up in 1998= While on the US and UK tour, the Signs felt the need of Hyatt; therefore upon returning to Pakistan, the band quickly reconciled with Hyatt, and fired Zaki. Ahmad joined the band and played guitar for the rest of the pending album, with Hyatt on keyboards. For the fourth album, the Signs collaborated with Shoaib Mansoor; all of the songs were written by Mansoor and sung by Jamshed. Finally in 1995, the Signs released Hum Tum which gained positive response from the country's electronic media. According to the music critics, the music mood on Hum Tum was somber, but more stoic and fatalistic, with Junaid's brilliantly vocals and Shoaib Mansoor's words of fatalistic resignation in the album. In spite of its success, the Signs faced competition when the media constantly compared the Vital Signs to Junoon, led by rival and former guitarist Salman Ahmad. The aesthetic and commercial success of the album wasn't enough as Rohail and Shahzad were ideologically and aesthetically drifting away from Juniad Jamshed and Shoaib Mansoor. The Signs struggled to keep itself united when the Signs toured to South Africa without its band leader Hyatt. The media then quickly speculated about the break-up of the band as early as 1996. Though Hyatt joined the Signs in 1997, the Signs made its final tour in the UK. Though the band's demise was never officially announced, by 1998 when the Signs were offered a deal by Pepsi Pakistan Inc. for another album, Rohail declined, signaling the end of Vital Signs. Junaid Jamshed went on to pursue a career as a solo singer, and Shahzad Hasan concentrated on his work as a music producer with Rohail Hyatt who formed a production company, known as \\"Pyramid Productions\\". After years =VS-Remixes release in 1999= In 1999, Rohail Hyatt released the collection of the Signs album songs, mixed with music remixes. The VS-Remixes received negative reception from its music journalists, though interested in the idea. The VS-Remixes album's only one single, \\"Maula\\", which was the only original piece, escaped mediocrity and garnered positive marks. Maula, a patriotic song, became an ultimate success and the song received a lot of appraisal from the music journalists. =Reunion in 2002 Nazia Hassan concert= The Signs confirmed their participation in a \\"Nazia Hassan Tribute Concert\\" to be held in Karachi on 9 March 2002. Popularly known as \\"Queen of Pakistan Pop music\\", Nazia Hassan tragically died of lung cancer in London, shocking the entire country. The Signs sang their popular songs for the first time in almost 7 years. The concert was attended by an enthusiastic audience and it was their original line-up which went up on stage, a line-up that hadn't played together ever since mid-1990, and who still stole the show. The Vital Signs reunited for a nostalgic 30-minute stint at the high-profile concert. The band realized that a whole new generation of pop fans had grown up and their brand of pop music is still well remembered. After the Nazia Tribute Concert, the pop industry was rife with speculations that the Vital Signs were set to record their long- awaited fifth album, but these speculations were denied by the band.On The Vital Signs Reunion Trail Retrieved on 29 December 2009 =2013 collaboration= After eleven long years, the members of Vital Signs and Junoon collaborated to release a patriotic song, Naya Pakistan. Written by Salman Ahmad and Aania Shah featuring Shahzad Hassan on bass guitar, Nusrat Hussain on keyboards, and vocalist Junaid Jamshed. The song was recorded at Indus Music World Studios and released on 22 February 2013. Salman Ahmed while talking about his latest project at BBC Pakistan said, \\"For almost a decade, Junaid has always asked me not to bring guitar or to ask him to sing. When you are friends with somebody you always have to transcend differences and I respect Junaid's views. Junaid once told me that his biggest regret was not to be a part of Jazba Junoon's recording. So when we came up with \\"Naya Pakistan\\", I asked him that this is the chance that's not going to come again so finally Junaid accepted the offer with the condition that he will sing only the opening lines with no music at all.\\" and further added \\"it signifies the metaphor for unity as we have to compromise for unity in hope of Naya Pakistan.\\"BBC interview premier of Naya Pakistan Retrieved on 26 February 2013. Musical style Vital Signs were most heavily influenced by Pink Floyd. Musically and lyrically, they have also cited bands such as a-ha, Rush, Scorpions, Duran Duran, Survivor, Radiohead, The Police and Led Zeppelin as their major influences. They were also widely known as Pakistan's first and most successful pop band and were given the title of \\"pioneers of pop music\\". Several bands and artists have cited Vital Signs as an influence or inspiration, including Abbas Ali Khan, Atif Aslam, Jal, Kaavish, Aaroh, SYMT and Fuz√∂n. Cultural legacy and influence The Vital Signs emerged when Pakistan was undergoing Islamization. Such Western ideas were denounced in the country, and the film industry was quickly declining in competition with the counterrevolution of the Indian film industry. According to the editorial written in The Express Tribune in 2011, the \\"Vital Signs and Pakistan's ingenious rock music was the only \\"arsenal\\" the country had against India's encroaching entertainment industry.\\" In a short span of time, the members of Vital Signs gained enormous popularity and were generally welcomed by the public; sometimes named the Beatles of Pakistan. Whilst Noor Jehan, Abida Parveen, Mehdi Hassan, Salma Agha, and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan remained mostly attached to Pakistan's film industry, the Vital Signs reached out to the regional and young population of the country. With the rise of Vital Signs and later, Junoon and others, the rock music exploded in the 1990s to become a vehicle for expressing patriotic nationalist spirit in Pakistan. According to the biographers of Vital Signs, despite the Western looks and influence of the Vital Signs, all of the members of Vital Signs were treated like country's most \\"beloved celebrities\\". According to the cultural critics and observers, all of the members of Vital Signs had become what members of The Beatles had become in the United States and the United Kingdom during the 1960s. Vital Signs were followed by Junoon, Awaz, Strings, and Jupiters, which all of whom had exploded the pop and rock music genre in the country, bringing the significant shift of the country's transformation into modernism during the 1990s. Undoubtedly, Vital Signs' music has been one major influential force which has truly kept the national spirits high amidst the prevailing social woes which have worsened since the 1980s; such music included songs like \\"Dil Dil Pakistan\\" and many more.

Cadmium was discovered in 1817 by a physician, Friedrich Stromeyer (1776‚Äì1835). The element was first found in the condensation of vapors (mixed with soot and zinc oxide) that rose out of a furnace in which zinc oxide was being roasted. Cadmium‚Äôs discovery is also loosely attributed to K.S.L. Hermann and J.C.H. Roloff who may have found cadmium in zinc oxide during the same year. A historical debate still remains as to who actually discovered the pure form of the element first. The phase of scientific history in which Stromeyer was active was one in which chemical discovery was being accomplished primarily by pharmacists, apothecaries and physicians. The practice of alchemy was dying out, and chemistry was just beginning to emerge as a separate science. Stromeyer, a professor at the University of G√∂ttingen, was testing zinc oxide, a medicine in those days, for purity. The name of the element was derived from the Latin ‚Äúcadmia‚Äù and the Greek ‚Äúkadmeia,‚Äù both ancient names for calamine (zinc carbonate).

It centered on Frank, Tony, Bing, Dean and Sammy in search of their lost brother Perry. The series had a short run and was met with a generally negative reception. Overview =Premise= The series centered on an ensemble cast of pale, rubbery, twitchy, yellow-eyed, shirtless humanoids with prominent bulging varicose veins often leaking various noxious bodily fluids who are distantly related to human beings, all of them ostensibly male, wandering around in their boxers. Their main food staple is cheese; nevertheless, they are able to eat other foods (at least potatoes, according to the episode \\"Not My Potato\\"). Their single parent is a large, floating, mute and fat male humanoid called Primus Gruntus Maximus, to whom they are born as embryos inside skin warts, much in the way of the Suriname Toad (see Pipa pipa). They live in a monastery in the wilderness. A group is formed, composed of most of the survivors of their species, in a quest to bring back one of their kind, Perry, who has abandoned his involuntary position of \\"Chosen One\\" (leader of their order) and is now living the \\"high life\\" among human beings (who seem to deal with the bizarre nature of the grunts by ignoring them and pretending everything is normal). In music video segments that are intervened with some episodes, supervised by Kathy Karp, there are additional animated portions of the main characters grunting. =Characters= The main characters were named after famous crooners of the 1950s: Frank (Sinatra), Tony (Bennett), Dean (Martin), Bing (Crosby), Sammy (Davis Jr.), and Perry (Como), all voiced by Doug Parker. Main * Frank * Tony * Bing * Dean * Sammy * Perry - A grunt that became the chosen one in the pilot episode: The Ceremony. Major * Gruntus Poobah - (Doug Parker) The leader of the brotherhood of grunt, he serves as the show's host and explains the plot before each episode. He also appears often in flashbacks when the grunts are in a troubled situation giving them advice. * The Dƒ±flash Queen - (Jennifer Wilson) A Turkish Queen that appeared in the episode \\"Scrub Me Sammy\\". * Gruntus Primus Maximumus - (Doug Parker) A floating fat and mute giant and the male parent of the grunts. All grunts are born or hatched from warts on his back. * The Dƒ±flash Queen's ƒ∞gnam lamp - (Jennifer Wilson) A Turkish lamp belonging to Sammy. * The Smein - (Doug Parker) A Nazi German skunk that appeared in the lost episode \\"Hunt for Grunts\\". * Krischm√§√üante - (Doug Parker) The Smein's best friend skunk. * Santa Claus (St. Nicholas or especially Kris Kringle) - (Doug Parker) An obese present bringer that appeared in the lost episode \\"The Grunts Who Came for Turkey.\\" The characters that would become The Brothers Grunt were first seen in one of MTV's numerous 30-second promos. This particular promo consisted of close-up shots of the at-the-time-unnamed character's faces who seemed to be straining to do something (veins in their heads would bulge, the characters would squint and grunt) until the scene cut to the MTV logo landing in a pool of sludge followed by a satisfied \\"Ahhhhh\\" (suggesting that the characters were suffering from constipation and the MTV logo was the 'turd' as it were). It is unclear when this promo aired if the storyline and characters for The Brothers Grunt had been developed already or if it had been developed into its own show after the success of the promo, in the wake of Beavis and Butt-head. Production The show's origins can be traced back to 1993 when the MTV ad \\"Grunt MTV\\" aired. At the time Danny Antonucci had animated several MTV ads to find work outside of International Rocketship Ltd., who he had worked for since 1984. Although Danny enjoyed the success of Lupo The Butcher, he wanted to leave International Rocketship Ltd. and start his own animation company. The result was a.k.a. Cartoon, which began on April 1, 1994. The studio began as a way to locate his work for The Brothers Grunt after MTV executive Abby Terkhule liked his MTV ad so much, he asked him to turn it into a television series. In production order, each episode of the show would consist of three to four segments. Reception The Brothers Grunt had a short run and was met with generally negative reception from critics. Kenneth R. Clark of the Chicago Tribune said that, with the series, MTV \\"created the most repulsive creatures ever to show up on a television screen\\" and \\"accomplished the seemingly impossible.\\" Charles Solomon of the Los Angeles Times called the show \\"an effortful, sophomoric half-hour that leaves the viewer longing for the refined good taste of Alice Cooper.\\" In their book North of Everything: English-Canadian Cinema Since 1980, William Beard and Jerry White called the series a \\"failure\\". The show was often compared to Aaahh!!! Real Monsters, an animated series that aired on MTV's sister channel, Nickelodeon. G√°bor Csup√≥, co-creator of Aaahh!!! Real Monsters, rejected these comparisons, claiming that his show was more character-driven, while The Brothers Grunt was an idea- driven series, also pointing out that both shows have different visual styles. When looking back on the series, creator Danny Antonucci stated that the series \\"didn't really do too well\\", also saying that the show has since become MTV's \\"dirty little secret\\". Episodes Note: All episodes directed by Danny Antonucci =Unreleased episodes= These episodes have been unreleased, but have been uploaded on to YouTube in June 2019, three of these episodes might have been produced, but are currently unconfirmed.

It lies along the B3306 road which connects St Ives to the A30 road. The parish encompasses the town of St Just and the nearby settlements of Trewellard, Pendeen and Kelynack: it is bounded by the parishes of Morvah to the north- east, Sancreed and Madron to the east, St Buryan and Sennen to the south and by the sea in the west. The parish consists of of land, of water and of foreshore. The town of St Just is the most westerly town in mainland Britain and is situated approximately west of Penzance along the A3071. St Just parish, which includes Pendeen and the surrounding area, has a population of 4690 (4,637 at the 2011 census). An electoral ward also exists: the population of this ward at the same census was 4,812. St Just lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). St Just is one of only two towns included within the Cornwall AONB. History The identity of Saint Just is not known. Cornwall's long resistance to the edicts of Canterbury and Rome makes it most unlikely that the saint was Archbishop Justus of Canterbury, as some sources claim. Another possibility is the 6th- or 7th-century Saint Iestyn, said to be the son of a ruler of Dumnonia. In 1478 William of Worcester found that the church was believed to contain the bones of Justus of Trieste.Cornish Church Guide (1925) Truro: Blackford; p. 114 Among the prehistoric antiquities nearby is Ballowall Barrow, a chambered tomb. St Just is one of the most ancient mining districts in Cornwall, and remains of ancient pre-industrial and more modern mining activity have had a considerable impact on the nearby landscape. =Churches and schools= St Just Methodist Free Church The cross at Leswidden The parish church of St Just is a fine 15th-century building. In 1336 the church was rebuilt and dedicated by John Grandisson, Bishop of Exeter; however only the chancel of this church survives and the nave and aisles are 15th-century in date. There are two Methodist chapels. St Just is the home of Cape Cornwall School which also serves Sennen, Sancreed, Pendeen, St Buryan and other places in the district. There are seven Cornish crosses in the parish; there are two in the vicarage garden and one built into the church wall. Other crosses are at Leswidden, Nanquidno and Kenidjack (two).Langdon, A. G. (1896) Old Cornish Crosses. Truro: Joseph Pollard =Mining= The ancient settlement has a strong mining history and was during the 19th century one of the most important mining districts in Cornwall both for copper and for tin. Mines within the area included Boscaswell Downs, Balleswidden, Parknoweth, Boscean, Wheal Owles, Wheal Boys, Levant, Botallack and Geevor (which closed in 1990). Geevor mine is now a tourist attraction which allows visitors to explore Cornish Mining heritage. The boom in 19th-century mining saw a dramatic increase in the population of St Just, the 1861 census records the population figure as being 9,290, however like other areas in Cornwall the population declined with the collapse in the tin trade in the 19th century. The town also suffered from the decision of the Great Western Railway to abandon its plans to make St Just the terminus of the London mainline to Cornwall. It was announced in July 2006 that the St Just mining district and the rest of the historic mining areas of Cornwall had become the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape World Heritage Site. Geography The nearby Cot Valley has a stream which runs to the sea. The area has been heavily mined, as was the area around St Just. The round boulders in the Cot Valley Cove here are of specific scientific interest. Also nearby is Cape Cornwall. Local government For the purposes of local government classification St Just is a town and elects a Mayor every 12 months from among the St Just Town Councillors. The St Just Town Council was created following the re-structuring of English Local Government in 1974, St Just having been an urban district council until then. Principal local government functions are now undertaken by Cornwall Council. St Just was originally part of the Penzance Poor Law Union until 1894 when it was incorporated into the West Penwith Rural District. In 1897 St Just in Penwith parish formed the sole basis of St Just Urban District. In 1974 the urban district was included in Penwith District, until that was abolished in 2009. Culture and local traditions St Just is home to the popular Lafrowda festival a seven-day community and arts celebration usually held in mid July. Plen an Gwarry, common green near the clock tower in the centre of St Just A more ancient celebration associated with the town is St Just Feast which is held every year to celebrate the dedication of the parish church on 13 July 1336. Feast celebrations were moved to the Sunday nearest to All Saints' Day in 1536 following an Act of Henry VIII which means it usually take place at the end of October / beginning of November. Feast itself is a two-day event with a church service and civic procession being held on Feast Sunday and a larger scale popular celebration being held on Feast Monday (which includes a meeting of the Western Hunt). A description of St Just Feast, from 1882, follows: > \\"Rich and poor still at this season keep open house, and all the young > people from St. Just who are in service for many miles around, if they can > possibly be spared, go home on the Saturday and stay until the Tuesday > morning. A small fair is held in the streets on Monday evening, when the > young men are expected to treat their sweethearts liberally, and a great > deal of \\"foolish money\\" that can be ill afforded is often spent\\" The Star Inn St Just also has a 'Plen an Gwarry' (Cornish for \\"playing place\\"), locally pronounced 'Plain an Gwarry'. These sites were used historically for open-air performance, entertainment and instruction. St Just's Plen an Gwarry occasionally hosts productions of the Cornish Ordinalia mystery plays. St Just has a healthy artistic scene, including the painter Kurt Jackson who has made several television appearances. Contemporary singer and comedian Jethro from nearby St Buryan played for St Just Rugby Club and has recorded a song entitled \\"St Just\\". The folk singer Martha Tilston released an album in 2010 called Lucy and the Wolves. This features a range of songs inspired by Cornwall. The first song on the album is called The Cape and is based upon Cape Cornwall in St Just. She has performed in Penzance a number of times and now lives in Penwith. The children's animated television series Jungle Junction, broadcast by the Disney Junior network, is produced by Spider Eye Productions of St. Just. The local community radio station is Coast FM (formerly Penwith Radio), which broadcasts on 96.5 and 97.2 FM. The Star Inn is sometimes called the last proper pub in Cornwall. Its clientele includes bird watchers who are attracted by the local wildlife.Protz, Roger (2000) Britain's 500 Best Pubs. London: Carlton Books ; p. 208 Bus services St Just bus station is served by First South West, who run routes 10 and 10A, both to Penzance and Pendeen. In summer it is served by the route 300 open-top bus, to Penzance via St Ives or Land's End. Unfortunately bus services have been reduced in recent years due to profit driven bus providers and a lack of interest in rural bus provision nationally. Twinning St Just is twinned with Huelgoat, Bro-Gernev, Brittany.St Just Town Council: Twinned with Huelgoat, Retrieved 2012-04-19. The town is also twinned, in partnership with Penzance, with Bendigo in the State of Victoria, Australia and with Nevada City in California, USA as a result of the historical links through the many people from the area who emigrated to the two destinations, mostly in the late 19th century, to find a better life in the mines there. There is still an area of Bendigo known as St. Just Point.

He resigned on 6 September 1945, but was reappointed for one year, and then resigned on 7 August 1946. Myers died in Wellington in 1950, aged 76. He had been made King's Counsel in 1922, KCMG in 1930, and GCMG in 1937. Family On 2 August 1899 he married Estelle Miriam Salom (24 February 1876 ‚Äì 11 May 1960), daughter of Maurice Salom, MLC of Adelaide, South Australia. There were two sons: Maurice Salom Myers (1900‚Äì1986) and Geoffrey Alexander Myers (1908‚Äì2002). Myer's sister Phoebe Myers was a notable educationalist, who represented New Zealand at the League of Nations in 1929.

He earned nationwide popularity in 1998 for his unique style of neoclassical playing in rock. An early engineer of the Vital Signs, he formed Junoon (lit. Obsession) in 1990 with American bassist Brian O'Connell and pioneered the Sufi influenced rock music in Pakistan. He started his activism in the mid-1990s and has been involved in two BBC documentaries concerning the issues in Pakistan such as society, education, religion and science. He has served as the UN Goodwill Ambassador for HIV/AIDS Programme towards spreading awareness about HIV in South Asia. While working with the Pakistan's media to help initiate peace between India and Pakistan, Ahmad continues to produce documentaries and solo guitar albums. At present, he is serving tenured professor at the Queens College of the City University of New York although, with Junoon being disintegrated, Salman Ahmad continues to perform as a solo artist under the \\"Junoon\\" label and has moved to New York and released one album as a solo artist, \\"Infiniti\\" in 2005. Salman was tested COVID-19 in April 2020. Early life Salman Ahmad spent his childhood in Pakistan, before moving to New York when his father got a job in the airline industry. Ahmad then attended middle and high school in the United States, where he was first exposed to rock music at a Led Zeppelin concert at Madison Square Garden. Motivated to become a musician, he began learning the guitar against his parents wishes. After graduation, he returned to Pakistan in order to attend medical school. However, due to vast changes in the political climate and the advent of extremism, Ahmad's guitar playing was repressed. He took action by playing at covert talent shows, unfazed by criticism and even death threats from extremists. These underground performances and the consequent censorship set the stage for him to become a peace advocate and eventually found the bands Junoon and Vital Signs Music career He has been teaching a class on music titled \\"Islamic Music and Culture of South Asia\\", as a guest faculty at Queens College. This year, he started his second semester as a guest faculty. On 1 March 2008, Ahmad performed with Yale Strom (a world leading Klezmer artist) at Temple Beth Sholom in Roslyn Heights as part of another \\"Common Chords II\\" concert celebrating Muslim and Jewish Music. Together with Strom, Ahmad leads the multi-faith ensemble Common Chords, whose members include Chatterjee, dhol player Sunny Jain, bassist Mark Dresser, vocalist Elizabeth Schwartz and others. In 2016, his new song \\"Kaise Bolun\\" from an upcoming Bollywood movie \\"Rhythm\\" starring Adeel Chaudhry has received enormous negative feedback from his fans on social media through showing their discomfort over song's music and video. According to people, they never expected such kind of music from legendary Salman Ahmad. = Nobel Peace Prize concert in Norway = Televised in around 100 countries, Ahmad and his band Junoon performed with artists from all over the world at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo, Norway, on 11 December 2007. He also played at the Nobel Peace Prize Ceremony on 9 December 2007, where he was joined by tabla virtuoso Pandit Samir Chatterjee. =Censorship on Junoon= Ahmad and his band Junoon suffered political censorship in Pakistan during the administration of Benazir Bhutto in the 1990s, partly due to a song denouncing political corruption. In 1998 during the administration of Nawaz Sharif, Junoon was again banned in Pakistan, because they protested against the nuclear power tests in India as well as their own country by saying, \\"Why escalate the arms race when people still need water? Why see our neighbors as enemies when we are so close to each other?\\" Ahmad played at the Roskilde Festival in 2000 under the banner of Freemuse, just a couple of years after the ban. As a musician who faced censorship in his home country, Ahmad says that \\"there is no conflict between my faith and my music, you can be a Muslim and play electric guitar\\". In 2006, during a Freemuse conference in Beirut he was part of one of the rare occasions where music and religion was taken seriously and where discussions on music and Islam focused on theology and not just social and cultural patterns. About this he said, \\"I've taken part in Freemuse dialogue meetings and press meetings. They have always been great meetings places for musicians, researchers and journalists and I've always felt that understanding the motivations behind and the mechanisms of censorship have been in focus ‚Äì not just condemning censorship. Having said that, we, the artists, should always be ready to defend our colleagues when the rights to freedom of expression are attacked, and thus we need an organisation such as Freemuse to help us do this.\\"  Television  Ahmad has acted in television dramas. * Dhundle Raste (Featured Vital Signs band) * Aahat * Talaash (Featured Junoon band) * Gulls and Guys ( Documentary cum travel reality show) The HBO documentary Open Your Eyes features the original song Open Your Eyes, composed by Salman Ahmad with vocals from Peter Gabriel.

It is a parody of Dragnet. Premise Mathnet is a parody of Dragnet, in which the main characters are mathematicians who use their mathematical skills to solve various crimes and mysteries in the city, usually thefts, burglaries, frauds, and kidnappings. Each segment of the series aired on one episode of Square One, a production of the Children's Television Workshop (CTW) aimed at teaching math skills to young viewers. Five segments made up an episode (one for each weekday), with suspense building at the end of each segment. Characters * Kate Monday (Beverly Leech) - A parody of Jack Webb's Dragnet character Joe Friday, Kate usually does not show her emotions when on the job and tackles almost every situation with a calm and rational mind. She appears in the first three seasons. * George Frankly (Joe Howard) - The partner of Kate Monday and later Pat Tuesday, George takes his job seriously but is frequently prone to fits of comical mishaps and immature reactions. He appears in all five seasons. He has a wife named Martha who he often mentions but is never seen or heard. * Pat Tuesday (Toni DiBuono) - George's second partner, appearing in Seasons 4 and 5 to replace Kate upon the show's move to New York City (the reason for her leaving Mathnet being unrevealed). Like Kate, Pat shares the deadpan mannerisms and no-nonsense attitude of Joe Friday. =Los Angeles cast= * Thad Green (James Earl Jones) - The Chief of the Los Angeles Police Department. He briefly appears in Season 4. * Debbie Williams (Mary Watson) - Technical analyst at the LAPD division where Kate and George works, she is frequently called upon to process data obtained during Mathnet investigations. =New York City cast= * Joe Greco (Emilio Del Pozo) - Captain of the New York City precinct, he is the man who George, Kate, and later Pat report to when they move to New York City starting in Season 3. * Benny Pill (Bari K. Willerford) - An undercover NYPD officer, he is Mathnet's semi-regular backup support. Guest stars A number of well-known actors made guest appearances on this show. Among them were *Edward Winter *Eve McVeagh *Yeardley Smith *Dick Wilson *William Windom *James Karen *Kenneth Mars *Henry Jones *Kevin McCarthy *Madge Sinclair *Geoffrey Lewis *Russell Johnson *McLean Stevenson *Dick Sargent *Jack Riley *Marcia Wallace *Estelle Harris *Tammy Grimes *Arnold Stang *Paul Dooley *Maddie Corman *John Michael Higgins *Jayne Meadows *Bob Arbogast *Melba Moore *\\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic *John Moschitta Jr. *Wayne Knight *Al Lewis *Betty Buckley In addition, real life LAPD officers Sam Salazar and Steve Fellman have also appeared as themselves, as did head writers David D. Connell and Jim Thurman as various characters. Math and science Real principles of math and science and mathematical tools used by the detectives to solve crimes include: * Alphanumerics (\\"The Case of the Unnatural\\") * Fibonacci sequence and modular arithmetic (see also Pisano period) (\\"The Case of the Willing Parrot\\") * Kinematics (\\"The Problem of the Missing Baseball\\") * Chromatic scale (\\"The Problem of the Passing Parade\\") * Displacement of fluids (\\"The Problem of the Trojan Hamburger\\") * Hamiltonian path (\\"The Case of the Smart Dummy\\") * Process of elimination (\\"The Case of the Great Car Robbery\\", \\"The View from the Rear Terrace\\") * Number patterns (\\"The Case of the Missing Air\\") * Bar charts and line charts (\\"The Case of the Purloined Policies\\", \\"The Case of the Great Car Robbery\\") Development and Production After a successful first season, production began on six new episodes for the second season. By the time production ended on the third season and its six episodes in 1989, Beverly Leech (Kate Monday) left, and was replaced by a new character named Pat Tuesday, played by Toni DiBuono. Production on the first six episodes with the new character commenced in 1990, and ended in 1991, in time for Square One TV's fourth season. Production on the final season and its five episodes began taping in 1991, and the last episode aired in 1992. During production, the background music also changed. Originally, it had a synth score. But gradually, as the series progressed, it was replaced with an orchestral score. The exterior shots of the Los Angeles police station were filmed at the former LAPD Highland Park Police Station, which had closed in 1983. It now houses the Los Angeles Police Museum and is located at 6045 York Boulevard.Los Angeles Police Museum The exterior shots of the New York City police station were filmed at the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House in Lower Manhattan. It now houses the George Gustav Heye Center of the National Museum of the American Indian and is located at 1 Bowling Green. Logo and motto The Mathnet logo and motto The Los Angeles seal, of which the Mathnet logo is a parody The Mathnet logo is a parody of the Los Angeles city seal. The symbols representing the city were replaced with mathematics iconography. The founding date is the year the pilot episode was filmed. The Mathnet motto \\"to cogitate and to solve\\" is a parody of the LAPD motto \\"to protect and to serve.\\" At the conclusion of each episode, a title screen displays the Mathnet logo and motto against a blue background. The logo and motto were also featured on the doors of the police cars used in the Los Angeles episodes, mimicking the appearance of actual LAPD police cars. Despite having their origins in Los Angeles, the show continued to use the logo and motto even after the setting of the show moved to New York City. Home media and syndication In 1991, GPN released five episodes from the first two seasons on VHS (\\"The Problem of the Missing Baseball\\", \\"The Trial of George Frankly\\", \\"The Problem of the Dirty Money\\", \\"The Case of the Missing Air\\", and \\"The View from the Rear Terrace\\"). Around the same time, select PBS stations combined parts of an episode to air in primetime. This was done primarily for seasons 3-5 (New York City era), although at least one omnibus from the Leech era was also broadcast. These versions were re-edited so that they would come in at just under an hour long, featured other segments from Square One TV as \\"commercials\\", and newly created end credits, among other differences. Two of the primetime airings were also commercially released as VHS tapes from Republic Pictures in 1992 (\\"Despair in Monterey Bay\\" and \\"The Case of the Unnatural\\"). Both Mathnet and Square One went off the air in 1994 (it was rerun until then after the final 1992 season was completed), reappearing from 1999 to 2003 on the cable television network Noggin, a joint venture of Nickelodeon and CTW. However, only 65 episodes were leased by the Noggin network. Mathnet segments also aired on Phred on Your Head Show (one of Noggin's original programs). Other media A Mathnet comic briefly appeared in 3-2-1 Contact magazine.

Dive boats may be propelled by wind or muscle power, but are usually powered by internal combustion engines. Some features, like convenient access from the water, are common to all dive boats, while others depend on the specific application or region where they are used. The vessel may be extensively modified to make it fit for purpose, or may be used without much adaptation if it is already usable. Dive boats may simply transport divers and their equipment to and from the dive site for a single dive, or may provide longer term support and shelter for day trips or periods of several consecutive days. Deployment of divers may be while moored, at anchor, or under way, (also known as or live-boat diving). There are a range of specialised procedures for boat diving, which include water entry and exit, avoiding injury by the dive boat, and keeping the dive boat crew aware of the location of the divers in the water. There are also procedures used by the boat crew, to avoid injuring the divers in the water, keeping track of where they are during a dive, recalling the divers in an emergency, and ensuring that none are left behind. Purpose The dive boat provides a means of transport to and from dive sites which may be too far or inconvenient for shore access. This is the case with the majority of recreational dive sites. It can also provide a base of operations where the divers can shelter, rest, store and change gear, socialise with other divers, eat and sleep between dives. They can provide enhanced safety, comfort and convenience, and provide guided access to sites of particular interest, but introduce their own set of hazards. They can also provide access to diving procedures which may be difficult, dangerous or impossible from the shore. Dive boat features Features that make a boat suitable for use by divers are: * Sufficient space and stability to carry the divers and their equipment. * Safe stowage for equipment during transit. * Facilities for the divers to enter the water from the boat and board the boat from in the water. Basic marine safety equipment for the class of vessel will be required by regional or national legislation, and diving specific safety equipment may also be carried as required by legislation or the diver certification agency to which the boat operator is affiliated. This will usually include: Basic marine safety equipment: * marine VHF radio * small craft emergency equipment - life jackets, flares, fire extinguishers and other equipment according to the size and operating range of the boat. Diving safety equipment: * oxygen first aid equipment. * diving shot, line, and buoy. * a signal flag to indicate that divers are in the water. * where necessary, equipment to bring an incapacitated diver on board. On larger boats additional diving support facilities may also be present: * high pressure diving air compressor * gas blending panel * recompression chamber * chase boat, or tender, to recover divers who surface away from the anchored vessel =Access facilities= Christmas tree style diver's boarding ladder If the freeboard of the boat is too high for the divers to climb back on board unaided, a ladder or other aid must be provided. Boarding aids range in cost, complexity, safety, and ease of use, from a boarding stirrup or a rope ladder, through rigid ladders and stairs with handrails, christmas tree ladders which allow the diver to climb while wearing fins, to temporary and fixed stern dive platforms, lifting platforms, diver lifts, and passerelles.  Diver lifts  A diver lift is a platform which is lowered into the water on which the diver stands while being lifted up to deck level. The lift mechanism constrains sideways motions of the platform, and has sufficient hand-holds for the diver to stand securely during lifting. A lift may also be used to lower a diver into the water. In most cases the lift will be suitable for transporting a fully kitted diver in a standing position, but in special cases seating may be provided. It differs from a diving stage or basket, which is lowered to diving depth, as a lift generally can only be lowered deep enough to stand up after swimming over the platform, which for most divers will be between . Types of dive boat The usual classification of recreational dive boats based on operational parameters includes: * the basic dive boat * the day boat * the liveaboard Some overlap of function is possible. Dive boats may be privately owned and operated, or run as a commercial business (generally known as charter boats). The structure, layout and size of a dive boat for any given application may vary considerably according to regional requirements and traditions, and convenience. =Basic dive boats= These are usually open boats used for short distance, or short duration, trips to dive sites, usually for a single dive or sometimes for a \\"two tank\\" trip, either with both dives at the same site, or with the second dive on the way back, or a short distance from the first. They generally have no amenities other than seating and stowage for dive gear, and the divers are usually exposed to wind, spray and sun during the trip. It is common for divers to kit up in their dive suits before boarding, for protection from the weather. It is unusual for the operator to provide refreshments other than bottled drinking water and an after-dive candy.  Rigid-hulled inflatable boat  Travelling to the dive site in a fast RIB. This boat is licensed to carry 12 divers and can travel at over 30kt on flat water Divers only spend a few hours at a time on these fast but exposed boats. The boats are usually relatively small so they can easily be transported on roads and launched at a convenient site depending on the weather. Boats of this size can be launched from slipways or through the surf on suitable beaches. The smaller models are suitable for recreational divers, as they can only transport a few divers. The larger boats can carry enough divers to be viable for professional use. These boats will generally carry basic safety equipment such as marine VHF radio, small boat safety gear, lifejackets and first aid oxygen administration equipment. Space in the boat is limited, and divers generally travel and kit up while sitting on the tubes opposite a central cylinder rack where the fully rigged scuba sets are stowed. Water entry is commonly by simultaneous rolling backwards over the side, and return to the boat by climbing back in over the tubes one at a time after removing the heavy parts of the diving equipment and handing it up to the crew. Some boats have ladders which hook over the tubes to make boarding easier for the less athletic diver, others rely on assistance from the crew. An advantage of this type of boat compared with similar-sized rigid boats is that the inflated tubes make the boat very stable during the entry and exit of the divers and if the boat is filled with water during surf transit maneuvers. These boats are usually fairly fast, maneuverable, seaworthy in surf and rough conditions, and relatively uncomfortable. They seldom provide any shelter from the elements, and their advantages are that they get the diver to the site and back fairly quickly, are generally good for operation through surf, are usually trailerable and can be launched at slipways and beaches. Open rigid hulled boats These serve a similar function to the Rigid-hulled inflatable boats, but do not have inflatable tubes. They are more durable, but usually heavier for the same load capacity. In Australia and New Zealand the light aluminium \\"tinnie\\" is often used as a dive boat. These boats are usually less stable than the equivalent inflatable and are not as easy to climb back on board, but are light, durable and economical. Kayaks and canoes are occasionally used as dive boats for one or two divers, and are portable and paddled by the occupants. Inflatable boats These are usually relatively small and used only for short distances with a small number of divers. They are relatively uncomfortable, and not usually very fast, but are stable for their size and can be deflated, folded, and transported in a car or utility vehicle. = Day boat = Divers on the deck of a day dive boat Rigid hulled day boat These boats are usually made of rigid materials - such as glass reinforced resin, plywood or aluminium. Day boats are generally relatively large: typically, between in length, as they must provide some comfort for the passengers for several hours. Many day boats are used for scuba-divers and also for other marine tourism activities such as fishing and whale-watching. In general, divers or passengers will spend only the daylight hours on a day boat, and do not sleep in them overnight. Dive boats which provide sleeping accommodation are generally referred to as \\"liveaboard\\" boats. Generally a professional crew operate the boat. The boat provides shelter from the weather and is likely to have various facilities such as a toilet (called the \\"head\\") and a small kitchen (called a \\"galley\\"), to cater for the guests and crew. Day-boats may have a saloon where divers can relax on upholstered benches, and one or more dining tables. Many day boats also have an uncovered sun-deck, and a shaded area, for divers wishing to be out in the open air. The boat will usually have a diving air compressor, oxygen first aid, a VHF radio, a GPS and possibly gas blending facilities. A day boat would generally be used to transport divers to multiple dive-sites (typically between one and three sites) during the same day, or multiple dives at the same site, with surface rest and refreshment periods between them. The divers usually enter the water by stepping off a dive platform or the side of the boat, and return on board using a ladder or a lift. In some cases a smaller \\"tender\\" is used to carry divers to and from less accessible sites, and to rescue divers who are in difficulty or who drift away from the boat. = Liveaboard = Virgin Islands On these commercially operated boats, the divers live and sleep on board and dive from the boat for periods of a few days to several weeks. A professional crew navigate and operate the boat. In addition to the usual domestic facilities expected by hotel guests, the boat will have a diving air compressor and emergency oxygen. Some have gas blending facilities and a few even carry a recompression chamber. The divers enter the water by stepping off a dive platform or the side of the main deck, and return to the boat using a ladder or a mechanical lift platform. Divers may also transfer to and from the dive site in a tender which is carried on, and launched from, the liveaboard boat. Liveaboards used on the West Coast of Thailand and in the Red Sea tend to be up to long and have: * The lowest deck, which is for the engine and stores. * The lower deck, which is all or mostly cabins for the passengers, usually two passengers per cabin. * At the stern, a small diving deck with diving ladders. * The main deck, which has the dining/social room, crew bedrooms, the bridge, and open space. * One or two upper decks. =Others= Boats intended for other purposes can usually be used as dive platforms provided that there is reasonably convenient access to the water and enough space to carry the necessary equipment. Auxiliary sailing yachts and motor yachts are often used by their owners as dive boats, and catamarans can be particularly amenable to this function as they often have spacious decks and stern boarding facilities with swim ladders. Diving from a boat Procedures for diving from a boat vary depending on the boat, the dive site and the dive plan. =Stowage of dive gear= Trim and stability of small boats can be significantly influenced by where and how the dive gear is stowed. When transiting a surf line, or in other rough sea conditions, the movement of the boat can cause poorly secured equipment to move, which can directly injure the occupants, and adversely affect trim and stability, and thereby the safety of the vessel and its occupants. Dedicated dive boats usually provide cylinder racks to stow the scuba sets, and may also provide bins or racks to stow other heavy equipment. Larger vessels, particularly liveaboards, may also provide a camera table and fresh water rinsing facilities for washing gear after the dive. =Deployment of divers= Divers will usually enter the water with positive buoyancy, as this allows them to make final surface checks, signal to the boat that they are OK and co-ordinate descent with a buddy, but there are occasions when negative buoyancy entries are chosen to avoid excessive drift in a strong current, in which case all pre-dive checks must be done on the boat, the buoyancy compensator, and where applicable, the dry-suit emptied of gas, and the breathing apparatus function thoroughly checked before entering the water. The risk of injury if there is an equipment problem is greater for negative entry, particularly with breathing gas failures. Water entry US Navy diver entering the water by backward roll from a RHIB Preparing to dive from a small stern platform on a sailing catamaran. Several techniques are used for water entry from boats, depending on the layout of the vessel, particularly the freeboard at the entry points. Large dive boats often have a permanent or folding platform at the stern just above the water, intended to make water entry and exit safer and more convenient for divers. Such platforms will usually be provided with steps or ladders from the deck, and folding ladders into the water. *: The diver sits on the gunwale or RHIB tube facing into the boat, and falls in backwards. Suitable for open boats with low sides. * is suitable for boats with low deck freeboard and no gunwale or railing. * is suitable for boats with low or moderately low deck freeboard and no gunwale or railing at the entry point. * is suitable for boats with moderate to high deck freeboard and no gunwale or railing at the entry point. *, suitable for boat with very low deck freeboard and no gunwale or railing. *Ladder entry may be used where there is a ladder into the water. Ladders may be fixed, folding or portable, and may be designed for use with swimfins. *Lifting platform entry: The diver/s stand on a platform fixed to the boat by the lifting mechanism, and are lowered a short distance into the water. *Stage launch: The diver/s stand on a platform called a or basket, which can be lowered by a cable to a considerable distance below the surface. =Monitoring and escorting the divers= If there is no current, and the divers are visiting a small site and can surface on the shot-line or anchor line, keeping track is nominally simple if all goes to plan, as they will surface at a predictable position which is marked. This is not always the case, and for some dives they will surface away from the marker even when the plan is followed precisely. In other cases divers will not make it back to the shot-line and have to surface independently. If the dive boat is anchored and the plan is for the divers to ascend on the anchor line, it may be necessary to have a tender or chase boat available to follow and pick up divers surfacing off the mark. *Spotting and recovering divers surfacing on their own decompression buoys: One system common with recreational divers is for one of the divers in each group to deploy a delayed surface marker buoy, also known as a decompression buoy, at the end of the dive. This serves to notify the boat that divers are surfacing, and where they are. It also warns other vessels to keep clear of divers in the water. *Following a drift diving group. A group of divers drift diving together will often follow a dive leader who tows a surface marker buoy throughout the dive. This allows the boat to follow the group effectively in most conditions. If any of the divers need to surface early they can ascend on the SMB line, and surface at the buoy, which is where they will be most easily seen by the boat crew. If anyone is separated from the group they can deploy a DSMB to notify the boat thet they will be surfacing away from the float. =Recovery of divers= Exiting water by stern platform ladder on a sailing catamaran Diver boarding using ladder on RIB Dive boat ladder deployed on RIB Divers may be picked up by a small tender or the dive boat may have a low enough freeboard for divers to climb over the side unaided, or with a bit of assistance from the crew. In this case it is usual to pass up heavy equipment such as weightbelts, and leave on the fins to help boost the diver out of the water. This is easiest with inflatable boats, particularly if provided with conveniently sited handles or ropes along the sides. For higher freeboards and easier boarding, mechanical aids may be provided: *ladders may be provided for boarding from the water.It is easier to climb a standard ladder or stairs if fins are removed first. They can be handed up to an attendant on the boat, clipped to the diver's harness, or carried by sliding the fin straps over the forearm. Christmas tree ladders can be climbed with the fins on the feet, and should stand off the side of the boat far enough for the fins to have clearance. *stern and side platforms may be used in conjunction with ladders or low freeboard decks. *passerelles or gangways. These are ramps which are lowered at one end to provide a path to walk from deck to water level. *lifting platforms (diver lifts) These are platforms attached to the boat on which the diver stands while being lifted to deck level or lowered a short distance into the water *stages and baskets. Platforms which lowered into and under the water and are hoisted back on board with the diver or divers standing on them. They are not attached to the boat except by the lifting cable. *boarding stirrups can be used on low freeboard boats, particularly rigid hull inflatables. They are straps with a loop, rung or hook at the lower end attached to the side of the boat. The standard versions require a fin to be removed to get the foot into the stirrup, and have a fixed length, which can be awkward to use as the stirrup may be uncomfortably high for a tall person if at the right height for a short person. Adjustable versions allow the diver to clip the loop around the foot with the fin in place, then the loop can be raised to the preferred height after fitting. Open sided rigid \\"hook\\" stirrups allow the foot to be positioned on a rigid stirrup without removing the fin. Stirrup steps have the same ergonomic disadvantages as rope ladders: they swing freely under load.

This can happen when divers do a group backward roll over the side of a boat, and do not all go in together. Anyone rolling late may land on top of someone already in the water. It can also happen when entries are from the same point and a diver does not ensure that the water is clear to enter. *Falling overboard in transit, particularly when crossing a surf line after a beach launch in a boat where the seating is along the sides. *Surfacing far away from boat and cannot be found. *Surfacing away from an anchored boat and unable to swim back to it against wind or current. *Hypothermia and wind chill on open boats in cold or windy weather *Sunburn and overheating on open boats in hot weather =Special procedures= Some boat diving activities require special procedures to reduce risk or enhance the diving experience. Logging in and out The risk of being left behind by the boat can be controlled by logging divers into and out of the water. If this is done by each diver only for themselves, there is little chance of confusion and error. In other protocols the skipper or divemaster is responsible for ensuring there is a name-list of all divers on board before leaving the shore, and that everyone on the list is back on the boat before leaving the dive site. Use of personal marker Surfacing at the shot- line, group surface marker, or personal marker buoy increases the visibility of a diver, and reduces the risk of not being noticed by a passing vessel. This will reduce the risks both of being run down and of being lost at the surface. It also provides an additional flotation device in case of fatigue. Signalling the boat If the boat cannot see a diver at the surface, the diver can use several methods to be more visible, and once seen, can indicate to the boat whether they are in difficulty or not. Diving from an anchored boat When using the anchor line to control ascents and descents, a \\"tag line\\" (or \\"lead line\\") may be used between the anchor line and the stern of the vessel, to allow secure transfer between these points in a current. A floating \\"drift line\\" (also \\"tag line\\", \\"current line\\" or \\"trail line\\") may be streamed from the stern or boarding platform to assist divers who drift astern of the vessel, and for something to hold onto while waiting to use the ladder. They can either hold onto the line and be pulled in by the crew, or pull themselves along the line. The far end of the line is usually marked with a brightly coloured buoy to show divers where it is and to help other boats avoid crossing the line. If there is any significant risk of a diver drifting away from the site, the dive boat should either be ready to slip the moorings at short notice, or have a tender in the water. Some skippers will tether the tender behind the dive boat where it can also be used as a drift line. A lazy shot or decompression trapeze may be suspended from the boat near the boarding area, and the drift line may be set up between this and the anchor line to guide decompressing divers ascending on the anchor line to the more convenient facility at the stern for the shallow stops. Live-boating is diving from a boat which is not anchored. There are increased risks due to the proximity of the divers to propellers when the engines are running, but there are also safety and convenience advantages to having the boat available to move at immediate notice, particularly in currents, as the boat can follow a group of drift divers, and pick up the divers from where they surface in most cases. Live boating is also used where anchoring is prohibited or impracticable. Decompression stations When a significant amount of decompression is planned by several divers at a site where they can reasonably expect to surface on the shotline, they may consider deploying a decompression trapeze. This keeps the divers together where it is easier to monitor them and provide support for the last part of the dive. Drift diving Drift diving occurs when the divers allow themselves to be conveyed past the bottom by the prevailing current, minimising the effort required to cover a relatively large distance, but moving the divers away from the start position and making their surfacing position uncertain. The usual way of monitoring the position of a group is by the lead diver towing a surface marker buoy, and the divers of the group all following the dive leader. The dive boat follows the buoy at a distance where the lookouts can see if any diver surfaces near the buoy. Divers from the group either surface along the buoy line, or if there is current shear or they are separated from the group, deploy their own DSMB and surface on that. Groups of inexperienced divers may be escorted by a second divemaster who tries to keep them together, directs stragglers back to the dive leader, and keeps track of remaining gas. Divers may be formally grouped in buddy pairs, surfacing together when the first is low on gas, or more informally, and rely on the divemasters if they have a problem. Wreck diving A major consideration of wreck diving is finding the wreck and getting the divers to the wreck with the minimum risk of getting lost. There are several methods for getting the divers to the wreck. The preferred method will depend on local conditions. In low visibility hooking onto the wreck is a reliable way of ensuring the divers will find it, but this procedure requires a wreck that is structurally suitable for snagging with a grapnel or anchor. A shotline which can be dropped off the wreckage is less likely to damage the wreck or become snagged and difficult to retrieve, but this requires appropriate visibility for the divers to be sure of finding the wreckage. When it is important to get back to the shotline for ascent, it may be tied to the wreckage by the first divers on site using a guide-line, which is retrieved by the last divers to leave. When there is a strong current, it may be necessary to drop in from up-current, a technique sometimes known as \\"parachuting in\\" or \\"free drop\\". The wreck may be first marked with a shotline, if this is considered useful or necessary. Divers may surface on the shotline, anchorline or personal DSMB depending on the conditions. When there are alternative methods for descent, including free drop and descent on the shotline. An (or Jersey upline) may be used to limit drift during ascent. This is a fairly substantial natural fibre rope which is deployed from the bottom using a small lift bag to provide the equivalent of a shotline. The lower end is tied off to the bottom, usually on a wreck, and the diver ascends on the line to avoid being swept away from the site by currents. After reaching the surface, the last diver cuts the line and it sinks back down, Natural fibre is used so the line rots away over a few years. Towing a diver Occasionally a diver may be towed using a \\"sled\\", an unpowered device towed behind a surface vessel which conserves the diver's energy and allows more distance to be covered for a given air consumption and bottom time. The depth is usually controlled by the diver by using diving planes or by tilting the whole sled. Some sleds are faired to reduce drag on the diver. =Emergency procedures= Diver recall There are several ways to recall divers to the surface during a dive. Some are not universally known or immediately obvious, and the chances of them being understood correctly and responded to appropriately are increased if they are specified in the dive briefing. *Pyrotechnic diver recall devices (Thunderflash) are small explosive devices calibrated to make sufficient noise to alert any divers in the vicinity without significant risk of injury to diver or environment. They have the advantages of being small, compact, and not easily confused with anything else likely to occur during the dive. They have disadvantages of a limited shelf life, and must be transported, stored, used and disposed of according to manufacturer's instructions and legal constraints. * A surface marker buoy line may be used to signal to the diver below, either by pre-arranged pull signals, or by sending down a weight clipped to the line and carrying a message. * Underwater loudspeaker and public address (PA) systems produce either a pre-programmed or microphone input sound signal. * Revving the boat's engines is a popular but notoriously unreliable method, as few divers can distinguish between the sounds of the engines of their support boat and those of any other roughly similar vessel. Lost diver procedures There are three aspects to lost diver procedure: *Lost buddy procedure, which is similar or identical to the procedure when diving from any other platform, until the diver notifies the boat that a diver is missing. *Lost diver underwater, and *Lost diver on the surface. Generally, since the diver is lost, it is not known whether they are lost underwater or on the surface. Early notification that a diver is missing allows early starting of the search process. If the divers are notified of their expected behaviour during the dive briefing, the chances of timely notification of a problem are improved. If a diver has not surfaced or returned to the boat when expected or a diver is reported missing by a buddy or dive leader, the diver is considered to be lost unless they have a surface marker buoy deployed. However, the presence of a buoy at the surface is no guarantee that it is connected to the diver. Decompression illness A dive boat will not be carrying a decompression chamber to treat a diver with decompression illness - that would normally classify it as a diving support vessel, so treatment would be limited to oxygen therapy with 100% oxygen, first aid emergency life support and transportation to the nearest suitable medical facility, or for operations where the equipment is available, and the risk is assessed as acceptable, technical or scientific divers may choose to do in-water recompression. Operating a dive boat The person in command of a dive boat is generally referred to as the skipper. In most cases the boat is fairly small and will not require many crew members. It is not unusual for the skipper to be the only crew member. There may be national legislation requiring a certificate of competency or license from the person in command of a dive boat. This will generally depend on whether the boat is operated for profit, how many passengers it is licensed to carry and how far offshore it is licensed to operate.

Over the years, the festival grew into the nine nights of its current run and presently ranks in the top 10% of all American festivals. Additionally, Riverbend has won several national awards from the International Festivals and Events Association, including 8 in 2007. The attendance for Riverbend has grown over the years and there are now regularly over 650,000 people that come over the course of the festival from all over Tennessee, the Southeast, the United States, and other countries. Individual nights can see some 80,000 people in attendance. The festival was named for the bend in the Tennessee River on which Chattanooga was established. More than a hundred acts, both well-known and new, converge each year to perform various kinds of music, including classic rock, country, urban, and bluegrass, as well as jam bands, on multiple stages set alongside the Tennessee River. Headline performers are featured nightly on the Coca-Cola Stage, a barge which has been converted into a full-size concert stage. The barge floats just off the shore against a large collection of amphitheater seats built into a hillside at the water's edge. Major local and national companies, such as Covista Communications, Unum, and Budweiser, sponsor other stages throughout the riverfront area. Admission is given to people with special scannable wristbands, which can be purchased in southeast Tennessee and north Georgia in the weeks leading up to the festival for a discounted price or purchased at the gate for a regular price. Admission was previously given to people who had collectible Riverbend Pins. A wristband provides admission for either one night or every night of the festival except for the Bessie Smith Strut.

For operations further out from shore helicopters & ships are mainly used. Most Government agencies rely on larger ships for rescues further from shore such as Royal Navy ships in the United Kingdom and Coast Guard Cutters used in the USA (Although the UK Coastguard does use larger vessels to tow ships in distress). Similarly the UK uses both the Royal Air Force SAR and UK Coastguard for helicopter rescues and the USA uses the United States Coast Guard for theirs.

Helicopters overcame this problem as they were able to hover over the victim and give aid by dropping a line to them with either a basket or diver to assist their extraction. Modern Rescue Craft =Sea= Many types of boats and ships are used, ranging from 2 man inflatables, such as the IRB's, through RHIB's all the way up to larger purpose built vessels. For offshore and far from coast rescues operations most countries rely on Naval or Coastguard ships for these operations For submarines which have got into difficulty there are highly specialised rescue submarines and support ships such as the NATO NSRS and the USA's DSRV =Air= Inland or shallow water There are still smaller boats which may be used on inland waters such as lakes or estuaries where the waters are generally calmer and shallow.

Schimmel by Hendrik Haverman Hendrik Jan Schimmel (June 30, 1823 - November 14, 1906), Dutch poet and novelist, was born at 's-Graveland, in the province of North Holland, where his father was a notary and the burgomaster. Biography From 1836 to 1842 Schimmel served in his father's office, and upon his death he worked in the office of the agent of the Dutch Treasury in Amsterdam, in 1849 he took a post with the Dutch Trading Company there. In 1863 he became a director of the Amsterdam Credit Association. His first volume of poems appeared in 1852; but his literary position was made as a writer of historical dramas in blank verse and one of the regenerators of the Dutch stage. His finest production was Struensee (1868), which was preceded by Napoleon Bonaparte (1851) and Juffrouw Serklaas (\\"Mrs Serklaas,\\" 1857). Among his other dramatic works were Joan Woutersz (a drama, 1847), Twee Tudors (\\"Two Tudors,\\" 1847), Gondelbald (1848), Schuld en boete (\\"Guilt and Retribution,\\" a drama, 1852), Het Kind van Staat (\\"The State Child,\\" a dramatic fragment, 1859); Zege na strijd (\\"Struggle and Triumph,\\" a drama, 1878). Schimmel's renderings of Casimir de la Vigne's Louis XI., Geibel's Sophonisbe, and Ponsard's Lucr√©ce are also still acted in the Netherlands. His novels are distinguished by their vigorous style and able characterization. The earlier, better-known ones betray the writer's English proclivities. The plots of Mary Hollis (1860, 3 vols, English translation, London 1872, under the title of Mary Hollis, a Romance of the Days of Charles II and William, Prince of Orange, 3 vols) and of Mylady Carlisle (1864, 4 vols) are laid in England, whereas those of his Sinjeur Semeyns (1875, 3 vols), a powerful picture of the terrible year 1672, and of De kapitein van de lijfgarde (1888, 3 vols, English adaptation, 1896, under the title of The Lifeguardsman, 1 vol.), a continuation of Master Semeyns, are almost entirely centred in Holland. He had many points of style and manner in common with Madame Bosboom-Toussaint, though both remained highly original in their treatment. Both finally reverted to essentially national subjects. To the earlier romances of Schimmel belong: Bonaparte en zijn tijd (\\"Bonaparte and his Time,\\" 1853), De eerste dag eens nieuwen levens (\\"The First Day of a New Life,\\" 2 vols, 1855), Sproken en vertellingen (\\"Legends and Tales,\\" 1855), Een Haagsche joffer (\\"A Hague Damsel,\\" 1857), De Vooravond der revolutie (\\"The Eve of the Revolution,\\" 1866). Schimmel was an early collaborator of Potgieter on the De Gids staff. His dramatic works appeared in a collected edition in 1885‚Äì1886 at Amsterdam (3 vols), followed by a complete and popular issue of his novels (Schiedam, 1892). He spent his last years in work on spiritualistic research and died at Bussum in 1906.

He graduated in 1835, and in 1837, defended his PhD thesis on analytical phytochemistry (\\"Grundz√ºge der Analytischen Phytochemie\\") at the University of Tartu. In the same year, he applied at the St. Petersburg Medical-Surgical Academy for an academic position and obtained a post of the head of chemical laboratory at Kazan State University. In 1839, he defended habilitation thesis on separation of minerals in mineral waters and was appointed an assistant professor. He became full professor in chemistry in 1844. Ruthenium In 1840, Claus, received a substantial amount of platinum ore samples for his studies from the Ural Mountains and the St Petersburg Mint and started working on chemistry and isolation of noble metals, in particular rhodium, iridium, osmium, and to a lesser extent, palladium and platinum. In 1844, he discovered a new chemical element, which he named ruthenium, after Ruthenia, the latinised name for Russia and the Latin name of Rus', by which –°laus meant the Russian Empire and Russia in particular. Choosing the name for the new element, he stated: \\"I named the new body, in honour of my Motherland, ruthenium. I had every right to call it by this name because Mr. Osann relinquished his ruthenium and the word does not yet exist in chemistry.\\" Claus managed not only to isolate ruthenium, but also determine its atomic weight and chemical properties. He noted the similarity of the chemical properties of ruthenium, rhodium, palladium and platinum and meticulously documented his results. For this discovery, he was awarded the Demidov Prize of 5,000 rubles (which was of much financial help to his large family). Claus sent samples of new element for analysis to J√∂ns Jakob Berzelius, who was one of the most renowned scientists in the field of new elements, and thereby became known to European scientists. Health and late years Claus was known for his negligent attitude towards his health. In particular, he often tasted his chemicals and new compounds and tested the strength of the acids by dipping a finger in them and touching his tongue with it. Once he severely burned his mouth while tasting one of the new ruthenium compounds that he had synthesized. When he isolated osmium tetroxide ‚Äì a rather toxic chemical ‚Äì he described its taste as astringent and pepper-like. In April 1845, he was poisoned by osmium tetroxide vapors and had to stop working for two weeks. In 1852, Klaus moved from Kazan back to the University of Tartu and assumed position of professor in pharmacy. He died in Tartu in 1864.

Twice awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union, he oversaw the expansion of the Soviet Navy into a global force during the Cold War.  Early life and prewar service  Born in Kamianets-Podilskyi to a Russian family, Gorshkov grew up in Kolomna. After joining the Soviet Navy in 1927, he entered the M.V. Frunze Naval School in Leningrad during October of that year. Gorshkov began his service with the Black Sea Fleet (then known as the Black Sea Naval Forces) upon graduation in November 1931 as a watch officer aboard the destroyer . He quickly became its navigator a month later and in March 1932 transferred to the Pacific Fleet to serve in the same position aboard the minelayer . Promoted to become flagship navigator of the minelaying and minesweeping brigade of the fleet in January 1934, Gorshkov was given command of the Uragan-class guard ship Buran in November of that year. He studied at courses for destroyer commanders between December 1936 and March 1937, becoming commander of the destroyer following completion. After becoming chief of staff of the Pacific Fleet Destroyer Brigade in October, Gorshkov was appointed its commander in May 1938. During this period he participated in the Battle of Lake Khasan before being transferred west to command the Black Sea Fleet Cruiser Brigade in June 1940.  World War II  Gorshkov during World War II From the first days after the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, the brigade participated in the operations of the Black Sea Fleet. Gorshkov was promoted to counter admiral on 16 September. During the Siege of Odessa Gorshkov led a landing in the area of Grigorievka before taking command of the Azov Flotilla in October. In late December and early January 1942 he commanded the landings on the north coast of the Kerch Peninsula. During August Gorshkov commanded 150 warships of the flotilla in a breakout from the Sea of Azov to the Black Sea after the withdraw of Soviet troops to Novorossiysk. After the resulting disbandment of the flotilla, he became deputy commander of naval forces and a member of the military council of the Novorossiysk Defense District. Gorshkov temporarily commanded the troops of the 47th Army defending the region in November during the Battle of the Caucasus. After taking command of the reformed Azov Flotilla in February 1943, he led it during landings at Taganrog, Mariupol, and Osipenko, before supporting the troops of the North Caucasian Front in the capture of the Taman Peninsula. During the November 1943 Kerch‚ÄìEltigen Operation, Gorshkov personally supervised the preparations and the landing of troops for the main attack. For his leadership of amphibious operations, he was awarded the Order of Kutuzov, 1st class, while receiving the Order of Ushakov, 2nd class, for his command of the flotilla during the recapture of Crimea. After being made commander of the Danube Flotilla in April 1944, Gorshkov led it during the August Jassy‚ÄìKishinev Offensive, supporting the troops of the 3rd Ukrainian Front in the crossing of the Dniester and the entry into the Danube Delta. Between September and November the flotilla went on to support the troops of the 2nd and 3rd Ukrainian Fronts during the Belgrade and Budapest Offensives. In December Gorshkov, promoted to vice admiral on 25 September, was transferred to command the Black Sea Fleet squadron, ending the war in that position. He was mentioned seven times in the orders of Joseph Stalin in the latter's capacity of Supreme Commander of the Soviet Armed Forces.  Cold War  Following the end of the war, Gorshkov continued to command the squadron until becoming Chief of Staff of the Black Sea Fleet in November 1948. He became the commander of the fleet in August 1951 and was promoted to admiral on 3 August 1953. Following his July 1955 appointment as First Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Navy, Nikita Khrushchev made him Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Navy in January 1956. As Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Navy, Gorshkov simultaneously served as a Deputy Minister of Defense of the Soviet Union, receiving the rank of admiral of the fleet on 24 April 1962. Under Leonid Brezhnev Gorshkov oversaw a massive naval build-up of surface and submarine forces, creating a force capable of challenging Western naval power by the late 1970s. This included the adoption of nuclear weapons, which were carried by ballistic missile submarines and aircraft, as well as the development of nuclear submarines and shipboard helicopters. In order to project Soviet military power, Gorshkov sent ships on lengthy cruises and formed operational squadrons in the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, building a blue-water navy. He received the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 7 May 1965 and was promoted to admiral of the fleet of the Soviet Union ‚Äì the highest Soviet naval rank ‚Äì on 22 October 1967. East German leader Erich Honecker, 1980 Gorshkov was again awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 21 December 1982. Transferred to the Group of Inspectors General of the Ministry of Defense in December 1985, a retirement post for elderly senior officers, Gorshkov died in Moscow on 13 May 1988. He was buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery. Gorshkov is often associated with the phrase \\"'Better' is the enemy of 'Good Enough'\\" (\\"–õ—É—á—à–µ–µ - –≤—Ä–∞–≥ —Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à–µ–≥–æ\\") which is reputed to have hung on the wall of his office as a motto. Similar sentiments have been attributed to Clausewitz and Voltaire. The motto appears in the Tom Clancy novel, The Hunt for Red October. The phrase is also attributed to Admiral Gorshkov in Norman Polmar's Guide to the Soviet Navy (1983, 3rd edition).Polmar, N: Guide to the Soviet Navy, p. xii (upper left corner), 1983. That is one year prior to Clancy's first published date for \\"Hunt\\" by the Naval Institute Press.

Lubomirski was a Prince of the Holy Roman Empire SRI. He was the initiator of the Lubomirski Rebellion of 1665-1666\\\\. Lubomirski was the son of voivode and starost Stanis≈Çaw Lubomirski and Princess Zofia Ostrogska. He was married to Konstancja Ligƒôza since 1641 and Barbara Tar≈Ço since 1654. He was starost of Krak√≥w since 1647, Court Marshal of the Crown in the same year, Grand Marshal of the Crown since 1650, Field Crown Hetman since 1658, starost of Nowy SƒÖcz and Spisz. He became Sejm Marshal of the ordinary Sejm between 1 February and 29 March 1643 in Warsaw. Biography Lubomirski became famous as a commander during wars with the Ukrainian Cossacks, Sweden, Transylvania and Muscovy in the 1648‚Äì1660 period. Inter alia he crushes the invading troops of George II R√°k√≥czi and marched into Transylvania. He also forced, together with Stanis≈Çaw \\"Rewera\\" Potocki, Russian troops to surrender at the battle of Cudn√≥w in 1660. Allegorical equestrian portrait of Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski after his victories over Russia He was a staunch defender of the \\"Golden freedoms\\" and the leader of the fierce opposition to King John II Casimir, who was attempting to increase his power. The King accused him of treason to the state and with an adjudication of guilt adopted by the Sejm, he lost all his offices and was sent into banishment in 1664. However, in 1665 he started the Lubomirski Rokosz (Rebellion) and countermanded system reforms of the Commonwealth. Using his influence Lubomirski had two sessions of the Sejm dissolved, in 1665 by deputies Piotr Telefus and W≈Çadys≈Çaw ≈Åo≈õ, and in 1666 by deputies Kasper Miaskowski and Teodor ≈Åukomski. At the head of regular army units and some noble levy (pospolite ruszenie) forces, he defeated the Royal army at Czƒôstochowa in 1665 and royal troops led by the future King John III Sobieski at MƒÖtwy in 1666. The Agreement of ≈Åƒôgonice gave him back his dignity and annulled the earlier adjudication of the Sejm, the king was forced to give up his reform plans and the introduction of \\"vivente rege elections\\" and resulted in indirect abdication of the monarch in 1668. However, Lubomirski was forced into exile. Assessment Some historians see Lubomirski as one of the most significant magnates of the 17th century. He frequently served as a deputy to the Sejm, was an excellent orator, military commander and politician, and had great private ambitions. At the same time, many question his accomplishments; he was prideful and ambitious has been accused of strange and traitorous behaviour during the war against Sweden (1655‚Äì1660). While he contributed to the defeat of the Swedish-allied Transylvanian invaders, he let their leader and top officials go in exchange for nothing (as opposed to holding them for a ransom, or as political pawns). Lubomirski's \\"victorious\\" rebellion against the Polish government prevented the realisation of key reforms, which in turn had grave consequences for the Commonwealth in the long term. His only real big accomplishment was the victory at Cudnow, but even that he did not accomplish alone. He also abandoned his army afterwards, seeking praise from the royal court, while the army disintegrated and soldiers went unpaid and wounded were unattended.

Life He was born at L√ºbeck, the son of a pastor. He was originally intended for his father's profession and studied at Bonn and Berlin, but his real interests lay not in theology but in classical and romance philology. In 1838 he accepted a tutorship at Athens, where he remained until 1840. In the same year he published, in conjunction with his friend Ernst Curtius, a volume of translations from Greek. His first poems were published in a volume entitled Zeitstimmen in 1841. In 1842 he entered the service of Frederick William IV, the king of Prussia, with an annual stipend of 300 thalers; under whom he produced K√∂nig Roderich (1843), a tragedy, K√∂nig Sigurds Brautfahrt (1846), an epic, and Juniuslieder (1848), lyrics in a more spirited and manlier style than his early poems. In 1851, he was invited to Munich by Maximilian II of Bavaria as an honorary professor at the university, and he relinquished his Prussian stipend. While in Munich he was at the center of the literary circle called Die Krokodile (Crocodile Society), which was concerned with traditional forms. In 1852 he married Amanda Trummer and the next year they had a daughter, Ada Marie Caroline. A volume of Neue Gedichte, published at Munich in 1857, and principally consisting of poems on classical subjects, denoted a further considerable advance in his objectivity. The series was worthily closed by the Sp√§therbstbl√§tter, published in 1877. He had left Munich in 1869 and returned to L√ºbeck, where he remained until his death. His works further include two tragedies, Brunhild (1858, 5th ed. 1890), and Sophonisbe (1869), and translations of French and Spanish popular poetry (Spanisches Liederbuch (1852), with Paul Heyse). Beginning as a member of the group of political poets who heralded the revolution of 1848, Geibel was also the chief poet to welcome the establishment of the Empire in 1871. His strength lay not, however, in his political songs but in his purely lyric poetry, such as the fine cycle Ada and his popular love-songs. He may be regarded as the leading representative of German lyric poetry between 1848 and 1870. Johannes Brahms set one of his paraphrases after Spanish poetry in the second of his Two Songs for Voice, Viola and Piano.

Cameras generally allow the user to select between spot, center-weighted average, or multi-zone metering modes. The different metering modes allow the user to select the most appropriate one for use in a variety of lighting conditions. In complex light situations professional photographers tend to switch to manual mode, rather than depending on a setting determined by the camera. Examples of metering modes Digital metering feedback Analog metering feedback (light meter) =Spot metering= With spot metering, the camera will measure only a very small area of the scene (1-5% of the viewfinder area). By default this is the centre of the scene. The user can select a different off-centre spot or recompose by moving the camera after metering. Certain models support a mode which allows averaging of multiple spot meter readings, and some support metering of highlight and shadow areas. Spot metering is not influenced by other areas in the frame. It is commonly used to shoot very high contrast scenes. For example, in a backlit situation a rising sun may be behind a person whose face will be much darker than the bright halo around the body and hairline. Spot metering allows the camera to measure the light reflected from the person's face and expose properly for that, instead of adjusting exposure for the much brighter light around the hairline. With the face properly exposed, the area around the back and hairline will become over-exposed. In many cases spot metering will over or underexpose a portion of the scene, so that the point of interest will be correctly exposed. Another example of the use of spot metering is photographing the moon. Other metering methods will increase overall exposure in an attempt to lighten the dark sky area, resulting in overexposure of the moon. Spot metering gives correct exposure of the moon and underexposes the rest of the scene which was dark already, so the low exposure is not noticeable. Spot metering may also be used for theatre photography, where brightly lit actors appear in a darkened auditorium. Spot metering is a method upon which the Zone System depends. =Center-weighted average metering= In this system, the meter concentrates on the central 60-80% of the scene. The balance is then \\"feathered\\" out towards the edges. This mode of exposure is less influenced by peripheral areas of the scene and is therefore well suited for photographs with subjects or objects of interest in the central part of the image. Some cameras allow the user to adjust the weight/balance of the central portion to the peripheral one. If the camera allows a user to move the focus point off the image center, metering will occur around the new focus location. Although promoted as a feature, center-weighted metering was originally a consequence of the meter reading from the focusing screen of SLR cameras. Light scatter from the focusing screen and proximity of the meter cell caused less sensitivity at the edges. =Average metering= In this metering mode, the camera uses light information from the entire scene and creates an average for the final exposure setting, giving no weighting to any particular portion of the metered area. In some situations, such as a snowy landscape, this mode will result in underexposure by 2 f-stops or more, because the metering system attempts to darken an excessively bright scene. =Partial (selective) metering= This mode meters a larger area than spot metering (around 10-15% of the entire frame), and is generally used when very bright or very dark areas on the edges of the frame would otherwise unduly influence the metering. As in spot metering, some cameras can use variable points for readings or use a fixed point in the centre of the viewfinder. =Multi-zone metering= Honeycomb Metering on a Dynax 5D. The AF point was set to the eye of the toy; the camera has been able to produce a good exposure, by not being fooled by the strong back lighting of the out of focus areas. This mode is also called matrix, evaluative, honeycomb, segment metering, or esp (electro selective pattern) metering on some cameras. This metering mode was first introduced by the Nikon FA and was termed Automatic Multi-Pattern metering. On a number of cameras this is the default or standard setting. The camera measures the light intensity in several points in the scene and then combines the results to find the setting for the best exposure. The method of calculation can be different from camera to camera. The actual number of zones used varies widely, from several to over a thousand. The design concept behind multi-zone is to reduce the need to use exposure compensation.Canon technology description for evaluative metering. Many manufacturers keep their exact calculation methods confidential as proprietary information. A number of factors are taken into consideration, including: autofocus point, distance to subject, areas in or out of focus, colours/hues of the scene, and backlighting. Multi-zone tends to bias its exposure towards the autofocus point, thus ensuring that the point of interest has been exposed for properly. A database of thousands of exposures may be pre-stored in the camera, and the processor can use that information to determine what is being photographed. Some cameras allow the option of locking exposure when autofocus is achieved. In other cameras the AF point is not used for exposure calculation, and in such cases it is common for metering to default to a central point in the viewfinder, using a pattern based on that area. There is considerable variation among different manufacturers how multi-zone metering is implemented‚Äìeven in the model range of the same brand‚Äìand how much priority is given to the AF point itself. Some \\"Scene\\" modes, such as sunset, sports and night exposures also often affect the calculations of this metering pattern. =Highlight-weighted metering= Clipping is reduced by using a high resolution metering sensor and analyzing each area for washed-out (\\"blown\\") highlights or underexposed shadows. Although there are some similarities with multi-zone, matrix, or evaluative metering, this mode uses a high-resolution sensor for detailed detection and gives more weight to reduce clipping.

These arboreal animals have pointed faces, long, bushy tails, dark-brown upper parts, pale bellies, and beards, which are reddish in males and white in females. They live in family groups and feed primarily on fruit, but also eat leaves, flowers, and nectar, with nectar from the kapok tree making up a large part of their diet during the dry season. They have declined sharply in numbers because of habitat destruction and hunting, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated their conservation status as \\"critically endangered\\". Description The mongoose lemur ranges in size from long plus a tail of . Both sexes are born with white beards, but become obviously dimorphic around six weeks of age when the males develop red beards and red cheeks. The males also have lighter faces than the females. Males may further distinguish themselves when scent-marking territory, as they occasionally develop a bald patch on top of their heads from rubbing. Male below, female above Distribution The mongoose lemur lives in dry deciduous forests on the island of Madagascar and in the humid forests on the islands of the Comoros. This makes the mongoose lemur one of only two lemurs found outside of Madagascar,Chicago Zoological Society - Brookfield Zoo's Mongoose Lemur page though it is believed to be an introduced species in the Comoros. Ecology The mongoose lemur mostly eats fruit, though flowers, leaves, and nectar also make up part of its diet. As such, mongoose lemurs act as both pollinators and seed dispersers, but may use the nectar of the kapok tree for nearly 80% of their diet in some parts of their range during the dry season.Bristol Zoo - Mongoose Lemur Feeding on grubs and beetles has also been observed. They are unusual among primates in that they are diurnal or nocturnal, depending on the season, being more active during the day in the wet season and changing activity to the night during the hotter dry season. Mongoose lemurs are arboreal, with the ability to jump several meters from one tree to another. They live in small family groups, usually consisting of a bonded pair and one to three offspring. These groups rarely encounter one another, but when they do, they are aggressive. Young are born just prior to the rainy season, from August to October. Gestation lasts about four months and weaning takes place around five months after the young are born. The offspring then usually stay with their parents until three years of age, when they have reached full maturity. Mongoose lemurs have seasonal habits. Their breeding, eating, and activity habits are largely shaped around the season. Mongoose lemurs usually conceive their offspring some time during October. They present as Nocturnal during the dry season and diurnal during the wet season. Status Captive mongoose lemurs can live up to 26 years, while wild specimens live 18‚Äì20 years. Mongoose lemurs in the wild are threatened by the destruction and fragmentation of the forests in which they live, and also by hunting. Their numbers have dwindled by about 80% over a period of 25 years, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated their conservation status as \\"critically endangered\\".

He was a main presenter on BBC Two's flagship political analysis programme, Newsnight, from January 2003 until January 2014, and presenter of BBC News at Five on the BBC News Channel. Since 2014 he has served as the Chancellor of the University of Kent. On 11 March 2017, Esler confirmed via his Twitter profile that he would be leaving the BBC at the end of the month to concentrate on his writing activities. He returned to the BBC later that year as host of Talking Books. He stood unsuccessfully as a candidate for Change UK in London at the 2019 European Parliament election. Early life Esler was born in Glasgow on 27 February 1953, the first son born to a manager of a building company. During his first weeks, he suffered from a condition that made him unable to digest milk and his parents feared for his life. He had an operation at just three weeks old. His family lived in Clydebank before they moved to Edinburgh, where he began his education at Duddingston Primary School before gaining a scholarship to George Heriot's School at the age of seven. His Scottish childhood had a profound and long- lasting effect on him. His parents moved to Northern Ireland but he remained in Edinburgh. Esler was the first in his family to go to university, graduating at the University of Kent with a BA in English and American literature in 1974. Alongside his studies he also wrote for Incant, the university newspaper. He then gained an MA in Anglo-Irish literature with distinction from the University of Leeds. Journalism career Esler began working as a journalist in 1976, aged 23, as a junior reporter with the Belfast Telegraph. He joined the BBC in 1977 as Northern Ireland reporter, working under Bernard Cornwell, and extended his role after joining Newsnight in 1982. Esler was appointed Washington correspondent in 1989 and then, a year later, became the BBC's chief North America correspondent. Based in Washington, Esler's responsibilities now extended to shaping the corporation's coverage across the whole of North America, which included reporting on both the earlier George H. W. Bush and Clinton administrations. Esler has also reported for news and documentary programmes across Europe, Russia, China and North and South America. Esler combined reporting with presenting from the mid-1980s on BBC One's regional news programme for London and the South East of England ‚Äì Newsroom South East. He worked as an anchor on the BBC News channel (at the time known as \\"BBC News 24\\") from its outset in 1997 and co- presented its prime-time slot with Sian Williams for several years. In January 2003, he joined Newsnight, replacing Jeremy Vine, who had left to take over from Sir Jimmy Young on Radio 2. During his career Esler has interviewed heads of state and government including Bill Clinton, Jacques Chirac and King Abdullah II of Jordan. He has also interviewed a wide range of cultural figures, including Dolly Parton, Doris Lessing, Pen√©lope Cruz, Angelina Jolie, V. S. Naipaul, Roger Waters, Vikram Seth and Seamus Heaney. Esler left Newsnight in January 2014, and was replaced by Laura Kuenssberg. In 2005, Esler interviewed George Galloway on Newsnight about the London bombings. The BBC was reported to have received hundreds of complaints about his interview alleging his questioning was \\"rude and aggressive\\". Peter Barron, editor of Newsnight, defended the questioning of Galloway's tactics: In 2007 a BBC Trust publication investigating impartiality in the organisation criticised an unnamed BBC news presenter for writing an article in the Daily Mirror newspaper entitled \\"Why the World Needs Hillary\\", stating they had been \\"unwise\\" for doing so. The article appeared to endorse Hillary Clinton to be the next US President and it soon emerged that the news presenter in question was Esler. The BBC report noted that \\"the apparent endorsement of one presidential candidate in elections in a country which, in his words, 'now seems seriously off course' could make it hard for that presenter to conduct American political interviews\\".FROM SEESAW TO WAGON WHEEL - Safeguarding impartiality in the 21st century BBC Trust, 21 August 2007 Until 2017, Esler was the main presenter of Dateline London on BBC News and BBC World News most Sunday mornings at 11 am. Between 2008 and 2017, he also presented the BBC News at Five on the BBC News channel on Fridays and when Huw Edwards was away. Esler has also hosted BBC Radio 4 factual series Four Corners along with fellow Scottish broadcaster Anne MacKenzie. He had a regular slot on Saturdays and Sundays, working across BBC World, BBC News and BBC One, and co-presented the regular Film Review with Mark Kermode. On 11 March 2017, Esler confirmed via his Twitter profile that he would be leaving the BBC to concentrate on his writing activities.Haha actually the end will come for some of it when I leave the BBC in two weeks to concentrate on book writing - so 2 more Dateline Londons Twitter/@GavinEsler, 11 March 2017 The Film Review was presented by other presenters although he continued to present Dateline London. He returned on 31 March 2017 to present his final BBC News at Five and Film Review. He returned to the BBC later that year as host of Talking Books. Literary career Esler is the author of five novels and two non-fiction books. The novel A Scandalous Man was described by fellow author Bernard Cornwell as \\"a compelling book, its political sophistication made luminous with wisdom sympathy and story telling\\". His fifth novel, Powerplay, was published by HarperCollins in August 2009. Esler's first non-fiction book, The United States of Anger published in October 1997 by Penguin, explores America's discontent with itself and was described by the New Statesman as \\"a vivid portrait of America in the 1990s\\". Esler's most recent book is Brexit Without the Bullshit published in June 2019, which discusses some of the potential consequences of the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. For several years he also wrote regular columns for The Scotsman, The Independent and other publications. Political career In August 2018, Esler spoke at a People's Vote rally in Edinburgh. People's Vote is a campaign group calling for a public vote on the final Brexit deal between the UK and the European Union. On 23 April 2019, he was announced as a candidate for Change UK in London in the May 2019 European Parliament election. The party announced its intention to stop Brexit and pursue a second referendum on membership of the EU. It gained 3.4% of the vote nationally and failed to win any seats. In London the party achieved 5.3% of the vote, but this was only just over half of the number required for Esler as lead candidate to win the 8th and last seat under the d'Hondt system of proportional representation used in the election. In an interview with the Huffington Post, published on 6 May 2019, Esler stated that, \\"I want to stop Brexit. Fix Britain. And then I want to reform the things that are wrong with the EU\\". He added, that he thought Nigel Farage was \\"affable\\" and a \\"good communicator\\", but whilst he was \\"more honest on that than many other politicians who support Brexit\\", his approach was reminiscent of Nazism; \\"The word 'betrayal' was used in Germany from 1919 onwards and throughout the 1920s with terrible results\\". Later in the interview, Esler was accused of implying that Brexit supporters were \\"village idiots\\" who should not be given airtime in the media, because \\"Brexit is about expertise\\". He was actually talking about balance and expertise: \\"Brexit is not only not just about left and right. Brexit is about expertise. You cannot and should not have someone who really knows what they are talking about balanced by someone who is essentially the village idiot\\". Personal life Esler has been married to rock violinist Anna Phoebe, his second wife, since 2012. They have two children. He was first married in July 1979, to teacher Patricia Warner, and they had two children together. The couple's separation was reported in 2008 and a divorce granted in 2010. Esler's hobbies include camping, hiking and skiing. He is a fan of progressive rock, citing King Crimson, Jethro Tull, Colosseum and Pink Floyd as favourite bands, and presented Prog magazine's Progressive Music Awards for three consecutive years between September 2012 and 2014. Awards and honours Esler's report on the military build-up in the Aleutian Islands as part of the Reagan administration's New Maritime Strategy earned him a Royal Television Society award. In 2007 he won a Sony Gold Award for his radio documentary report Letters from Guantanamo on Sami al-Hajj, one of the detainees in Guantanamo Bay. Following the broadcast, al- Hajj was released from American custody. Esler has received two honorary degrees from the University of Kent: an honorary MA was awarded in 1995, followed by an honorary Doctorate in Civil Law in 2005. He was installed as the sixth Chancellor of the university in July 2014.

Biography  He started life in a merchants office at Antwerp. In 1831 he made a journey to Sweden, described in two volumes, which appeared at Amsterdam in 1836‚Äì1840. Soon afterwards he settled in Amsterdam, engaged in commercial pursuits on his own account, but with more and more inclination towards literature. With Heije, the popular poet of Holland in those days, and Bakhuizen van den Brink, the rising historian (see also Groen van Prinsterer), Potgieter founded De Muzen ( The Muses, 1834-1836), a literary review, which was, however, soon superseded by De Gids (\\"The Guide\\"), a monthly, which became the leading magazine of Holland. In it he wrote, mostly under the initials of W. Dg, a great number of articles and poems. The first collected edition of his poems (1832‚Äì1868) appeared in 2 volumes (Haarlem, 1868-1875), preceded by some of his contributions to De Gids, in 2 volumes also (Haarlem, 1864), and followed by 3 volumes of his Studien en Schetsen (\\"Studies and Sketches,\\" Haarlem, 1879). Soon after his death a more comprehensive edition of Potgieter's Verspreide en Nagelaten Werken (\\"Miscellaneous and Posthumous Works\\") was published in 8 volumes by his friend and literary executor, Johan C Zimmerman (Haarlem, 1875-1877), who likewise supervised a more complete edition of Potgieter's writings which appeared at Haarlem in 1885 1890 in 19 volumes. Of Potgieter's Het Noorden in Omtrekken en Tafreelen (\\"The North in Outlines and Pictures\\") the third edition was issued in 1882, and an edition de luxe of his poems followed at Haarlem in 1893. Under the title of Personen en Onderwerpen (\\"Persons and Subjects\\") many of Potgieter's criticisms had collectively appeared in 3 volumes at Haarlem in 1885, with an introduction by Conrad Busken-Huet. Potgieter's favourite master among the Dutch classics was Hooft, whose peculiarities in style and language he admired and imitated. The same vein of altruistic, if often exaggerated and biased, abhorrence of the wonted conventionalities of literary life runs through all his writings, even through his private correspondence with Huet, parts of which have been published. Potgieter remained to his death the irreconcilable enemy of the Dutch Jan Salie, as the Dutchman is nicknamed who does not believe in the regeneration of the Dutch people. Potgieter held up the Netherlanders of the golden age of the 16th and 17th centuries as models to be emulated. In these views he essentially differed from Huet. Yet the two friends worked harmoniously together; and when Potgieter reluctantly gave up De Gids in 1865, it was Huet whom he chose as his successor. Both then proceeded to Italy, and were present at the Dante festivities at Florence, which in Potgieter's case resulted in a poem in twenty stanzas, Florence (Haarlem, 1868). According to a criticism in the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition, Potgieter's influence in Holland was very marked and beneficial; but his own style, that of ultra-purist, was at times somewhat forced, stilted and not always easily understood.

History In the spring of 1948 the recently reorganized All India Forward Bloc split into two factions. In February the Central Committee of AIFB met in Varanasi to discuss the situation after Independence and Partition. At the meeting it was decided that AIFB should break all relations to the Indian National Congress and that a separate party should be created out of the branches in Pakistan. The then general secretary of the party, Sheel Bhadra Yagee effectively dissolved the Bengal state committee of the party, and appointed ad hoc committees in West Bengal and East Bengal. This spurred discontent inside the party. Leading the rebellion against Yagee was the party president, S.S. Cavesheer. Yagee decided to resign as general secretary. In May the Central Committee met again and appointed Ramchandra Sakharam Ruikar as the new general secretary. Yagee grouped his followers around himself, and by this time the two factions virtually functioned as two separate parties. The group led by Ruikar had its emphasis on nationalism rather than Marxism, and called themselves 'Subhasists'. On December 29‚Äì31 the Ruikar faction held a congress in Ashutosh College Hall, Calcutta. Ruikar was elected general secretary and Cavesheer as president. At the same time the Marxist faction held a congress in Hooghly. Thus the split was complete. The Ruikar-led party adopted the Indian tricolour with a leaping tiger as their flag, identical to the one used by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's Indian National Army. In 1951 the issue of reunification was raised inside Ruikar's party. In June the Central Committee of the party held a meeting which decided to move ahead with the reunification of Forward Bloc. Ruikar and Leela Roy disagreed with the decision, and were expelled. The two Forward Blocs held a joint central committee meeting in Howrah on June 23, in which the two parties merged. Ruiker and Leela Roy did however mobilize their followers and reconstituted themselves as a separate party. In the 1952 general elections, the Electoral Commission let the Ruikar-led party contest as 'Forward Bloc (Ruikar)' and the other AIFB group as 'Forward Bloc (Marxist)'. FB(R) contested six Lok Sabha seats, 3 in Madhya Pradesh, 1 in Madras and 2 in West Bengal. The elections resulted in a humiliating defeat for Ruikar's party. In total the six candidates got 133 936 votes. In the West Bengal legislative assembly election the party was a member of the People's United Socialist Front, together with the Socialist Party and the Revolutionary Communist Party of India (Tagore).M.V.S.

He was the first anchorman in Mexican television and his TV news program, 24 Horas (24 Hours) was for decades the most important in the country. Early life Zabludovsky was born in 1928 in Mexico City to Polish Jewish immigrants. He was the brother of Abraham Zabludovsky (1924-2003), a famous architect. Career Zabludovsky was a well known anchor man hosting 24 Horas, the main news program on the popular Televisa network between 1970 and 1998. Owing to the nonconfrontational approach of the network, the programme was perceived as partisan and supportive of the government. In 1998, citing a desire to cut down his workload and ill-health, he retired from presenting 24 Horas, which also came to an end with his departure, marking the end of an era in Mexican journalism. After leaving 24 Horas, Zabludovsky worked on special newscasts and documentaries. However, in 2000, he resigned from the Televisa network following the resignation of his son, Abraham, who also worked for Televisa. Zabludovsky claimed that his son had been overlooked for the position of night time news anchor and that he was resigning out of solidarity with him. During his career at Televisa, Zabludovsky covered several important episodes. He was one of the few Mexicans reporting in Cuba the day Fidel Castro entered Havana in 1959 during the overthrow of the Batista dictatorship and reported from his car phone (at that time these car phones were the only mobile phones in Mexico and were a luxury item), and reported on the 1985 earthquake that destroyed several parts of Mexico City. However, there was criticism of his coverage of presidential elections in 1988 and 1994, when he favored the candidate of the government party to the exclusion of opposition contenders. He interviewed many notable people, including President Ernesto Zedillo, Salvador Dal√≠ and Mar√≠a F√©lix. Eighteen months after leaving television, he began a radio newscast on a new station, La 69 at Grupo Radio Centro, with the pledge of being more critical \\"...in agreement with the new Mexico in which we are living.\\". Beginning on March 3, 2004, the newscast was also broadcast on Radio Red AM and Radio Red FM. Zabludovsky hosted the newscast until June 22, 2015, being hospitalized shortly after. From 2007 until 2015, he also wrote \\"Bucareli\\", a weekly column for Mexican nationwide newspaper El Universal. In 2009, his voice appeared in Up!, a Disney-Pixar film.About Zabludovsky's voice in Up! (Retrieved July 10, 2017) Zabludovsky returned to television in 2012 as part of ESPN Deportes and ESPN Mexico's coverage of the 2012 Summer Olympics, he was also part of the network's coverage of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup the following year. On June 2, 2015, exactly one month before his death, Zabludovsky covered the historic match between the Cuba national football team and the New York Cosmos in Havana, Cuba. The match marked the first time an American sports team visited Cuba after the United States began normalizing relations with the island nation.

It organises the football league, Austrian Bundesliga, the Austrian Cup and the Austrian national team, as well as its female equivalent. It is based in the capital, Vienna. Since 1905, it has been a FIFA member, and since 1954, a UEFA member. Since 7 April 2002, Friedrich Stickler (Dipl. Eng.), the director of executive committee of the Austrian lottery, has been the President of the Austrian Football Association. Supporting him is its President, Kurt Ehrenberger, Frank Stronach, Dr. Gerhard Kapl, and Dr. Leo Windtner. In 2004, it was announced there are 285,000 players (both sexes) in Austria playing for 2,309 teams in the federation, although many more players play informally or for non-recognised teams. Thus the federation is the largest sporting organisation the country. Football is, perhaps with the exception of skiing, the most popular sport in Austria. Football possesses a large value, and has a rich history and tradition in Austria. History In 1894, the First Vienna Football Club, the first football team in Austria, were founded in Vienna. From this nucleus, the Austrian Football Association was established in 1904. One year after the establishment, Austria became a member of the international football federation FIFA and hosted the fifth FIFA congress in 1908. The milestones of the federation and past football history were the years 1930 to 1933, 1950 to 1954 and then 1958 as well as 1978, 1982, 1990 and 1998 with the participation of Austria at the World Cup. Hugo Meisl was one of the best-known personalities in the early years of the Austrian Football Association, becoming General-Secretary and national team coach in 1927. At the 1936 Summer Olympics, his team won Silver after losing 2-1Italy, Austria's only international final. Meisl's team, nicknamed the Wunderteam, remained unbeaten from 12 April 1931 to 23 October 1932 in 14 successive matches. The highlights of this series were the 6-0 (Berlin) and 5-0 (Vienna) victories against Germany. The 1950s saw more achievements with their well- known football greats such as Ernst Ocwirk (twice captain of the FIFA World Selection Team), Ernst Happel, Gerhard Hanappi and Walter Zeman. The FIFA World Cup 1954 ranks among being most successful in Austrian Football Association history. Twenty years after being in 4th place in the FIFA World Cup 1934 held in Italy, Austria returned to the circle of the best teams again.

Biography Busken Huet, son of a Hague civil servant, attended Gymnasium Haganum and studied theology at Leiden University, in Geneva and Lausanne. He was appointed pastor of the Walloon church in Haarlem in 1851. A student of Prof. Johannes Henricus Scholten and friend of Prof. Abraham Kuenen, Busken Huet familiarized his parishioners with the insights of 'Modern Theology', e.g. with respect to the Bible. In 1857-1858 he created a scandal by publishing Brieven over den Bijbel ('Letters on the Bible'), in which he popularized the 'Modern' view on the origins and authority of the Bible: \\"Just as all Christianity is purely devotional love after Christ‚Äôs example, the entire Bible is purely a human creation. Yes, a creation inspired by the personal faith of the prophets and apostles; brought forth by the national genius of the Hebrews, which genius both the apostles and the prophets represented; one that did not fall from the clouds like a meteor, but rose from the bosom of the Jewish people, as the goddess of beauty rose from the billows whose foam created her; one which was not, in part or whole, put on paper and collected in one or two volumes through the external intervention of Providence, but which emerged leaf by leaf, like a budding flower, from the stem of Israel; one that did not bypass the Jews or go over the heads as it came to us from God, but came from the Jews themselves, under God‚Äôs guidance; a human creation, in other words, inspired by human faith, consummated by human art, preserved by human care, understood by every true human heart and acknowledged as the voice of the heart, as the voice of human devotion, human suffering, human happiness: such is the human creation the Bible is to me.\\"C. Busken Huet, Vragen en antwoorden: Brieven over den Bijbel. Haarlem: Tjeenk Willink 1858, p. 494-95; quoted in: David J.

Boston / Leiden: Brill 2011, pp. 115-47. In 1862, after realizing that these 'Letters' had ruined his clerical career, Busken Huet resigned his charge. Attempting journalism instead, he went out to Java in 1868 as the editor of a newspaper. Before this time, however, he had begun his career as a polemical man of letters, although it was not until 1872 that he was made famous by the first series of his Literary Fantasies and Chronicles, a title under which he gradually gathered in successive volumes all that was most durable in his work as a critic. His one novel, Lidewyde, was written under strong French influences. Returning from the Dutch East Indies, Busken Huet settled for the remainder of his life in Paris. For the last quarter of a century he had been the acknowledged dictator in all questions of Dutch literary taste. Perfectly honest, desirous to be sympathetic, widely read, and devoid of all sectarian obstinacy, Busken Huet introduced into Holland the light and air of Europe. He made it his business to break down the narrow prejudices and the still narrower self-satisfaction of his countrymen, without endangering his influence by a mere effusion of paradox. He was a brilliant writer, who would have been admired in any language, but whose appearance in a literature so stiff and dead as that of Holland in the fifties was dazzling enough to produce a sort of awe and stupefaction. The posthumous correspondence of Busken Huet has been published. Also, Huet used papers by Peter Thaborita for his description of Pier Gerlofs Donia.

The meeting preceded the assassination of Albert Anastasia by a few weeks, as well as a smaller meeting at the New Jersey estate of Ruggiero Boiardo. The Apalachin meeting was attended by about 100 Mafia heads from the U.S., Italy and Cuba. A raid by New York State Police caught many heads of families or their deputies. Many other family heads and their deputies were suspected of being present by law enforcement but evaded detection and capture.

Russell Bufalino et.. =Bufalino era= With Barbara's death in June 1959, the Mafia Commission recognized Russell Bufalino as the official family boss. Bufalino maintained a close alliance with the New York Genovese family. After Bufalino was imprisoned in the late 1970s on extortion charges related to the collection of a debt, his underboss, Edward Sciandra, became the acting boss of the family. Sciandra was aided in running the family by captains Anthony Guarnieri, James David Osticco, and Phillip Medico, Consiglieri Remo Allio, as well as soldiers William D'Elia, Angelo Bufalino, John Rizzo, Angelo Son, and Joseph Sperrazza.1980 Report: A Decade of Organized Crime.

According to the Pennsylvania Crime Commission D'Elia was placed in the crew of Caporegime Phillip Medico. D'Elia advanced through the ranks of the organization rather quickly due to the natural attrition of members and indictments in the 1980s and 1990s. He took over the crime family's solid waste rackets and oversaw the traditional Mafia rackets run by the members and associates of the family. D'Elia also attempted to replenish the aging ranks of the family with limited success. As boss, D'Elia worked with the other crime families in New York City, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Southern Florida, and Los Angeles. In the 1990s, D'Elia was linked to a money laundering scheme involving numerous Northeastern Pennsylvania Bookmakers, Escort Services, corrupt politicians, and associates of Russian Organized Crime.

It is located from the Finnish‚ÄìRussian border, from the Finnish town of Imatra, and from St. Petersburg. Population: History Originally called Enso, the town was founded in 1887Official website of Leningrad Oblast. to serve a paper mill. At the time, Enso was part of Viipuri Province and the J√§√§ski Municipality in the Grand Duchy of Finland, which was an autonomic state within the Russian Empire. When Finland became independent in 1917, Enso remained part of Finland. The Finnish villa (1930) at Kantorovicha Street The territory was ceded by Finland to the Soviet Union by the Moscow Peace Treaty as a result of the Winter War. After the Winter War, the Finns and the Soviets disagreed on the interpretation of the peace treaty regarding Enso. The former Minister for Foreign Affairs of Finland V√§in√∂ Tanner wrote in his memoirs: \\"Already now a dispute about the district of Enso developed. According to the map attached to the peace treaty Enso was clearly intended to belong to Finland but the Russians claimed that it should belong to them. Later the map was redrawn according to the interests of the Russians so that the border bends at Enso.\\" In March 1940, Enso became a part of Yaskinsky District with the administrative center in the work settlement of Yaski. It was a part of the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, after March 31, 1940 of the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic. Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim, Marshal of Finland, and Risto Ryti, President of Finland in Enso on June 4, 1944 Enso was recaptured by Finns between 1941 and 1944 during the Continuation War but was again ceded to Soviets by the Moscow Armistice. This secession was formalized after signing the Paris Peace Treaty in 1947. The Finnish population was resettled to Finland, while migrants from Central Russia resettled the Karelian Isthmus. On November 24, 1944, Yaskinsky District was transferred from Karelo-Finnish SSR to Leningrad Oblast. On October 1, 1948, the district was renamed Lesogorsky and on January 13, 1949, all Finnish names of the localities were replaced with Russian names. In particular, Enso was renamed Svetogorsk. On December 9, 1960, Lesogorsky District was abolished and merged into Vyborgsky District. In 1972, the Soviet Union awarded Finland a construction project for a large new cellulose and paper mill in Svetogorsk. The project was paid with Soviet crude oil. The project also gave a start to cross-border relations. Notably, the construction workers in Svetogorsk were called \\"builders\\", and the project also had intent to \\"build friendship between peoples\\". On April 18, 2008, about five hundred inhabitants of Svetogorsk participated in a protest which included a road barricade on the Finnish‚ÄìRussian border as a protest against poor road conditions and lack of investment in road improvement at both federal and municipal level. According to the Finnish public service broadcaster Yle, the militia participated in effectively cutting off through traffic. The main issue of discontent was the lack of a bypass, which, according to reports, should have already been built. Administrative and municipal status Apartment buildings in Svetogorsk Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with the urban-type settlement of Lesogorsky and two rural localities, incorporated within Vyborgsky District as Svetogorskoye Settlement Municipal Formation.Oblast Law #32-oz As a municipal division, Svetogorskoye Settlement Municipal Formation is incorporated within Vyborgsky Municipal District as Svetogorskoye Urban Settlement.Law #17-oz Economy =Industry= Before the Winter War, the town was a major factory site for Enso-Gutzeit Oy, the Finnish pulp and paper company (now Stora Enso). In the 1940 Moscow Peace Treaty, the new Finnish-Soviet border was deliberately drawn to leave the factory complex on the Soviet side. The town's major industry is still pulp and paper. OAO Svetogorsk, one of the biggest paper mills in Russia, is the major employer. Covering , OAO Svetogorsk produces pulp, printing paper, and packaging board. Its brands include Svetocopy and Ballet office paper. Since December 1998, OAO Svetogorsk has been majority owned by International Paper. At end of 2001, the plant employed 3,000 people; by 2008 this had fallen to 2,200. Immediately adjacent to OAO Svetogorsk is a tissue mill. This formed part of the original mill complex but was split-away and resold by International Paper to SCA during the acquisition of OAO Svetogorsk from Tetra Laval, which controlled the plant since 1995. Svetogorsk Tissue, as the separate entity was to be called, became fully integrated into SCA Hygiene Products Division in 2003 (called Essity since 2017). It employs around four hundred people. Its products include Zewa and Tork brands of paper towels and toilet paper. =Border crossing= The Imatra‚ÄìSvetogorsk border crossing plays a key role in the transportation of timber between Russia and Finland. Also, around 150 employees commute daily from Imatra to the paper mills. The border crossing, which had temporary status, was a bottleneck causing frequent delays due to lengthy customs checks and inadequate facilities. A Russia- Finland agreement in 1997 allowed the development and eventual permanence of the border crossing. This ‚Ç¨7 million European Union TACIS-funded project ran from 1999 and the new international frontier, capable of handling 1,300 cars per day, opened on July 3, 2002. =Transportation= Svetogorsk is connected by railway with Kamennogorsk, where it has connection to the old Vyborg‚ÄìJoensuu railroad. There is suburban traffic to Vyborg. The continuation of the railroad beyond Svetogorsk to the Finnish‚ÄìRussian border is disused. Svetogorsk is connected by roads with Kamennogorsk and Vyborg, as well as with Imatra across the border.

He batted left-handed and threw right-handed. He was raised in the Detroit suburb of Livonia and graduated in 1965 from Franklin High School, playing for the school's baseball team while there. Career Carbo was an outfielder who started his career with Cincinnati. He had been the Reds' number-one draft pick in the inaugural 1965 draft, ahead of Johnny Bench. In his 1970 rookie season, Carbo posted career highs in batting average (.310), home runs (21), runs batted in (63), hits (113), on-base percentage (.454), slugging average (.551), OPS (1,005) and games played (125). Carbo was selected Rookie of the Year by The Sporting News, but he slumped in the next two seasons and was sent to the Cardinals. Then, he was traded to Boston in 1973. Boston The Cardinals sent Carbo and Rick Wise to the Red Sox for Reggie Smith and Ken Tatum. He said of coming to Boston: \\"When I first met [Red Sox owner] Mr. Yawkey, he was shining shoes in the clubhouse,\\" said Carbo, \\"and I went up to him and gave him $20 and told him to get me a cheeseburger and fries.\\" While playing for the Red Sox, he was a part of the \\"Buffalo Heads\\", with Bill \\"Spaceman\\" Lee and Ferguson Jenkins. Carbo would also carry around a giant stuffed gorilla that was named Mighty Joe Young. The gorilla sat next to him in the middle seat on planes. Carl Yastrzemski wanted the gorilla placed on the bat rack in the dugout. The 1975 World Series matched the Red Sox with the heavily favored Cincinnati Reds, who were looking for their first title since 1940. Boston had also suffered a drought by not winning a Series since 1918. The clubs battled back and forth, with the Reds winning three of the first five games. Carbo was excited to see some of his old teammates. Carbo would be on the bench, and his former teammates were sympathetic. Clay Carroll inscribed a picture for him and it read \\"Good luck in the World Series.\\". After Game 3, when Carbo hit a home run off him, Carbo said, \\"They told me Carroll was in here and just went crazy, ripping up the picture into little pieces.\\" Game 6 was postponed three days because of rain. Carbo did not join his teammates for batting practice at Tufts University because he said he couldn‚Äôt find it. He spent the early part of Game 6 working on his Louisville Slugger. \\"I‚Äôm sitting there and I‚Äôm whittling this bat, I took a lathe and took all the polish off. It's nice and smooth. Rick Wise is sitting next to me and says, ‚ÄòYou know, you can‚Äôt use that bat.

That's how I kept myself amused.\\" In Game 6 (October 21), with two outs and two batters on base in the eighth inning, Roger Moret was scheduled to bat. Darrell Johnson told Carbo to get ready. > And I said, \\"Hey, I‚Äôm not going to hit. Juan Ben√≠quez, grab a bat, you‚Äôre > going to hit.

Carbo with the Boston Red Sox Carbo's pinch three-run home run tied the score 6-6, paving the way for Carlton Fisk's game-winning homer in the bottom of the twelfth for a 7-6 Red Sox victory. Carbo's pinch homer was his second of the Series, tying Chuck Essegian's 16-year-old record for most in a World Series. Game 7, watched by an estimated 71 million TV viewers, saw the Reds triumph in the ninth inning on a bloop single by Joe Morgan for a 4-3 win. Tom Yawkey would pass away in 1976, and Carbo wept. Carbo saw Yawkey as a father figure, because his father did not really care about him. Even after his game tying home run in Game 6, he waited all night for a call and did not receive one. New owners Haywood Sullivan and Buddy LeRoux hired a private detective to follow Carbo. Later career He was eventually sold to the Cleveland Indians in June 1978. This made Bill Lee mad and he called the owners \\"gutless\\" and staged a walkout. His major league career ended in 1980 with the Pittsburgh Pirates. Carbo went on to cosmetology school and opened a hairdressing salon. In 1985, in a federal drug distribution trial, former Cardinal Keith Hernandez said Carbo was the man who introduced him to cocaine in 1980. Carbo subsequently lost his house and his salon because of the bad publicity. In 1989‚Äì90, while playing in a senior league in St. Petersburg, Florida, Carbo hit rock bottom. His mother had committed suicide, his father died two months later, and his family was disintegrating. He was spending $32,000 a month on drugs (mostly cocaine). Dalton Jones, a member of the Red Sox 1967 Impossible Dream team, took one look at Carbo and said, \\"You need Jesus.\\" In a 12-year career, Carbo was a .264 hitter with 96 home runs and 358 RBI in 1010 games. Carbo was the field manager for the Pensacola Pelicans from 2003‚Äì2005. Carbo compiled a record of 150‚Äì103 in his three seasons as the field manager, a winning percentage of .593. He led the Pelicans to the championship series in the independent Southeastern League in 2003, losing to the Baton Rouge RiverBats. Carbo resigned in February 2006, in order to return full-time to Diamond Club Ministry. Admissions to drug use On April 1, 2010, in an interview with the Boston Globe, Carbo admitted to doing drugs during the 1975 World Series. He states, \\"I probably smoked two joints, drank about three or four beers, got to the ballpark, took some [amphetamines], took a pain pill, drank a cup of coffee, chewed some tobacco, had a cigarette, and got up to the plate and hit.\\" It was not just a one-time binge, however. In the same article, Carbo states, \\"I played every game high. I was addicted to anything you could possibly be addicted to. I played the outfield sometimes where it looked like the stars were falling from the sky.\\" \\"I threw away my career\\", said Carbo. \\"If I knew Jesus Christ was my savior at 17, I would have been one heck of a ballplayer, a near Hall of Famer. Instead, I wanted to die.\\" Carbo was out of baseball by age 33. After baseball After retiring, he spent time as a hairdresser. He has since become a born again Christian. In 1993, he founded the evangelical organization \\"Diamond Club Ministry.\\" and now spends his time ministering to families and their children through his love for the game. He says he has not used drugs or alcohol in over fifteen years. On November 10, 2004, he was inducted to the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame.

Overview Groen is a Dutch historical icon.Langley, McKendree R. \\"The Legacy of Groen van Prinsterer,\\" Reformed Perspective, January 1985, pp. 25-28. He was an educated and devout man of the Dutch middle class (his father, Petrus Jacobus Groen van Prinsterer, was a physician). Being a devout Christian, he never left the Dutch Reformed Church, the state church of the Netherlands and of its Royal Family, in spite of its sorry state, in his view. Being a gentleman, he mingled in aristocratic circles, while also coming under the influence and then leading the evangelical renewal movement thriving at the time (the European Continental counterpart to the Second Great Awakening), known in the Netherlands as the R√©veil. He studied at Leiden University,Skillen, James W. & Rockne M. McCarthy (eds.) Political Order and the Plural Structure of Society. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, p. 53. and graduated in 1823 both as doctor of literature and LLD.Van Dyke, Harry. \\"Groen van Prinsterer's Appreciation of Classical Antiquity.\\" In: In the Phrygian Mode: Neo-Calvinism, Antiquity and the Lamentations of Reformational Philosophy. University Press of America, 2007, p. 13. From 1829 to 1833 he acted as secretary to William II of the Netherlands and during this time attended Brussels Protestant Church under pastor Merle d'Aubign√©. Afterwards he took a prominent part in Dutch home politics, and gradually became the leader of the Anti-Revolutionary Party, both in the Second Chamber of parliament, of which he was a member for many years, and as a political writer. In Groen the doctrines of Guizot and Stahl found an eloquent exponent. They permeate his controversial and political writings and historical studies, of which his Handbook of Dutch History (in Dutch) and Maurice et Barnevelt (in French, 1875, a criticism of Motley's Life of Van Olden-Barnevelt)Wheaton, Robert. \\"Motley and the Dutch Historians,\\" The New England Quarterly 35 (3), 1962, pp. 318‚Äì336. are the main works. Groen was ardently opposed to Thorbecke, whose principles he denounced as ungodly and revolutionary, i.e. inspired by the French Revolution. Although Groen lived to see these principles triumph in the constitutional reforms implemented by Thorbecke, he never ceased to oppose them until his death in 1876. Publications By the time the revolutionary movement in Europe had begun to break out in various cities, the monarchist and restorationist secretary to the Dutch king began lecturing on the spiritual-political crisis of the Continent. Groen also was ready to publish. He had begun to do so with his Overview of 1831, his Essay on Truth of 1834, a manuscript harder to date precisely but entitled Studies on the revolution, his Prolegomena of 1847 (the following year Karl Marx issued the Communist Manifesto). Groen's most influential work Lectures on Unbelief and Revolution appeared in an initial edition in 1847, and then a revised edition of 1868; there were subsequent editions as well. In time he founded an intellectual Christian political circle among the upper classes, through which Groen tried to teach the political responsibility of such people. He also founded a newspaper. He is best known as the editor of the Archives et correspondence de la maison d'Orange (12 vols, 1835-1845), a great work of patient erudition, which procured for him the title of the Dutch Gachard. John L. Motley acknowledges his indebtedness to Groen's Archives in the preface to his Rise of the Dutch Republic,\\"It is unnecessary to add that all the publications of M. Gachard ‚Äî particularly the invaluable correspondence of Philip II. and of William the Silent, as well as the \\"Archives et Correspondence\\" of the Orange Nassau family, edited by the learned and distinguished Groen van Prinsterer, have been my constant guides through the tortuous labyrinth of Spanish and Netherland politics.\\" ‚Äî Motley, John Lothrop (1856). The Rise of the Dutch Republic: A History. New York: Harper & Brothers. at a time when the American historian had not yet made the acquaintance of King William's archivist, and also bore emphatic testimony to Groen's worth as a writer of history in the correspondence published after his death. At the first reception, in 1858, of Motley at the royal palace at the Hague, the king presented him with a copy of Groen's Archives as a token of appreciation and admiration of the work done by the worthy vindicator of William I, prince of Orange. This copy, bearing the king's autograph inscription, afterwards came into the possession of Sir William Vernon Harcourt, Motley's son-in-law. Thoughts The translator of the Dutch political thought and influence of Groen, Harry Van Dyke, has summarized Groen's mature view in this way: > \\"We are living in a condition of permanent revolution... revolutions are > here to stay and will grow much worse in scope and intensity unless men can > be persuaded to return to Christianity, to practise its precepts and to obey > the Gospel in its full implications for human life and civilized society. > Barring such a revival, the future would belong to socialism and communism, > which on this view were but the most consistent sects of the new secular > religion. To Groen, therefore, the political spectrum that presented itself > to his generation offered no meaningful choice. \\"In terms of his analysis, > the 'radical left' was composed of fanatical believers in the godless > ideology; the 'liberal centre,' by comparison, by warm believers who warned > against excesses and preached moderation; while the 'conservative right' > embraced all those who lacked either the insight, the prudence, or the will > to break with the modern tenets yet who recoiled from the consequences > whenever the ideology was practised and implemented in any consistent way. > None of the shades or 'nuances of secular liberalism represented a valid > option for Christian citizens.\\" Groen called for a rejection of the entire > available spectrum of political positions, calling for a \\"radical > alternative in politics, along anti-revolutionary, Christian-historical > lines\\".Van Dyke, Harry (ed. and trans.)

Lubomirski was Krajczy of the Crown and Secretary of the King since 1620, voivode (military commander) of the Ruthenian Voivodeship since 1628 (or 1625?), voivode of the Krak√≥w Voivodeship and General starost of Krak√≥w since 1638, starost of Krzepirz, Niepo≈Çomice, Spisz, Sandomierz, SƒÖcz and Zator. Since 1640 (or 1647) prince of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1609 he took part in the Siege of Smole≈Ñsk by sponsoring several military units, which he used to keep order (and enforce his will) in the Krak√≥w Voivodeship (his units defeated Lisowczycy after this mercenary band started pillaging Krak√≥w areas in the 1620s). After the death of Jan Karol Chodkiewicz, in the rank of regimentarz he commanded the Polish forces during the battle of Chocim in 1621 (see Moldavian Magnate Wars). In 1634 Lubomirski was second in command in Ukraine, after Stanis≈Çaw Koniecpolski, and in 1635 he befriended a French negotiator at the Treaty of Sztumska Wie≈õ, Claude de Mesmes, Count Avaux. Lubomirski was a pious Catholic, a sponsor and beneficiary of many churches, although he disliked the Society of Jesus. He opposed plans to marry W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV Waza to a Calvinist princess. He also opposed W≈Çadyslaw's idea of Kawaleria Orderowa and his plans to wage war on Ottomans. Lubomirski was a friend of Jerzy Zbarski, a popular politician in Sandomierz and Krak√≥w voivodeshops, considered friendly but known to lose his temper and was several times elected as a deputy to the Sejm. Lubomirski inherited a large estate from his father and multiplied it by a marriage with Zofia Ostrogska in 1613.

He discovered the element scandium in 1879, by separating out scandium(III) oxide, also known as scandia. In addition to his work on the analytic chemistry of elements and rare earths, he made substantial contributions to Swedish agriculture, including methods of fertilization and the introduction of sugar beets as a crop. Education Nilson was born in Sk√∂nberga parish in √ñsterg√∂tland, Sweden. Later his family moved to the island of Gotland, where his father, Nikolaus, owned Rosendal farm in Follingbo. In later life, Lars Fredrik Nilson retained a small holding on Gotland, which he visited yearly. After graduating from Wisby high school on Gotland, Lars Fredrik Nilson enrolled at Uppsala University in 1859. There he studied the natural sciences including zoology and biology. His work in mineralogy drew the attention of the chemistry professor at Uppsala, Lars Fredrik Svanberg, a former student of J√∂ns Jakob Berzelius. To obtain a Doctorate of Philosophy in Sweden, the candidate was expected to pass a series of examinations in all areas of study, including languages, history, and philosophy as well as their main area of study, within a fixed period of time. In 1865, just before Nilson could complete his final examination, his father became severely ill. Nilson returned home to Gotland, where he took over management of the farm, working in the fields as needed. When his father recovered some months later, the harvest and fall planting had been successfully completed, and Nilson had installed the first engine threshing machine to be used in Gotland. Nilson's own health had greatly benefited from his work on the farm: the young man who had arrived home in poor health had become much stronger. He was able to return to Uppsala and pass the next season's examinations, becoming a doctor of chemistry in 1866. Career In 1866, Nilson became an associate professor of chemistry at Uppsala, with the responsibilities of chief assistant and demonstrator of chemistry at Svanberg's laboratory. He was a calm and patient teacher, relying more on demonstrations than on lectures. He insisted that after the work of the day was completed, it was to be left behind, and not discussed during leisure. His earliest papers focused on sulfides, arsenical sulfosalt minerals, and selenous acid, extending the work of Berzelius. =Elements= In 1874 Nilson became professor of general and agricultural chemistry at Uppsala. From then on he could devote more time to research. He began working on rare earths such as euxenite and gadolinite, using methods of successive fractionation introduced by Nils Johan Berlin. One of his goals was to better understand the relationship of the newly discovered elements to the proposed periodic system. The mineral Euxenite The element Scandium The element Titanium In 1879 Nilson separated out the oxide scandia. By doing so he discovered a new element, scandium, which he named for Scandinavia. The discovery was of particular importance because the existence of an element with such properties, \\"ekaboron\\", had been predicted by Mendeleev, based on his organization of the periodic system. Nilson's spectral analysis indicated a previously unreported pattern of lines. Per Theodor Cleve demonstrated the equivalence of Nilson's scandium and Mendeleev's hypothetical ekaboron. Nilson and Sven Otto Pettersson were the first to isolate titanium metal in a relatively pure form, extracting a 95% pure sample in 1887. J√∂ns Jacob Berzelius had extracted titanium metal in 1825, but only in a very impure form. In 1910 Matthew Hunter was finally able to produce 99.9% pure titanium metal, through his new Hunter process. Nilson also studied the gas density of metals which made it possible to determine the valence of various metals. =Agriculture= Nilson held the chair of analytical chemistry at Uppsala from 1878 until 1883, when he became professor of chemistry of the Royal Swedish Academy of Agriculture and Forestry in Stockholm. As an agricultural chemist and Director of the Agricultural Chemical Experiment Station, he published nearly sixty papers on topics such as soils and manures. As a result of his inquiries many of the swamps of Gothland were drained and put under cultivation. The sugar beet was introduced and became a major crop, as chalky moors were treated with potash fertilizers. He also conducted studies on cow's milk and various plants for cattle fodder. Nilson was elected a foreign member of the Chemical Society of Great Britain on February 2, 1888. Nilson was a member of several other academies as well. He received several awards, including the Order of the Polar Star.

The Others was theatrically released in the United States on August 2, 2001, by Dimension Films and in Spain on September 7, 2001, by Warner Sogefilms. The film was a box-office success, grossing over $209.9 million worldwide and received positive reviews from critics, with many praising Amen√°bar's direction and screenplay, as well as the musical score, atmosphere and Kidman's performance. The film won seven Goya Awards, including awards for Best Film and Best Director. This was the first English-language film ever to receive the Best Film Award at the Goyas (Spain's national film awards), without a single word of Spanish spoken in it. The Others was nominated for six Saturn Awards including Best Director and Best Writing for Amen√°bar and Best Performance by a Younger Actor for Alakina Mann, and won three: Best Horror Film, Best Actress for Kidman and Best Supporting Actress for Fionnula Flanagan.

Plot In 1945, Grace Stewart occupies a remote country house in Jersey and awakens one day from a nightmare in the immediate aftermath of World War II. She lives with her two young children, Anne and Nicholas, who have a rare disease characterized by photosensitivity (possibly xeroderma pigmentosum). Grace hires three new servants--the aging Mrs. Bertha Mills, elderly gardener Edmund Tuttle, and a mute girl named Lydia. Mrs. Mills explains to Grace that she worked in the same house many years before. When odd events occur at the house, Grace begins to fear there are unknown \\"others\\" present. Anne claims to have seen a group of people in the house several times: a man, a woman, an old woman and a child called Victor, who claimed that \\"the house is theirs\\". After Grace hears footsteps and unknown voices, she orders the house to be searched. She then finds a 19th-century Book of the Dead, a photo album of mourning portrait photographs. When Grace asks Mrs. Mills about her previous experience in the house, Mrs. Mills recounts that many left due to an outbreak of tuberculosis. At night, Grace witnesses a piano playing itself and becomes convinced that the house is haunted. She runs outside in search of the local priest to bless the house. Before leaving, Grace instructs Tuttle to check a small nearby cemetery to see if there was a family buried there who had a little boy named Victor. Tuttle finds the cemetery but, per Mrs. Mills's orders, covers the gravestones with leaves. Mrs. Mills assures Tuttle that Grace will learn in due time the reasons behind the unexplained events. Outside, Grace runs into her husband Charles, whom she thought had been killed in the war. Charles greets his children after a long absence, but is distant during his short stay at the house. Later, Grace comes across an old woman in one of the rooms and attacks her. The old woman is only a vision and Grace has in fact attacked her own daughter, Anne. Later, Anne tells her brother that their mother went mad in the same way \\"that day\\" but he does not remember. Charles says he must leave for the front, even though Grace claims that the war is over. The two embrace and lie motionless together in bed. The next morning, Charles has left and the children are screaming that the curtains are gone, letting in sunlight. Grace accuses the servants of removing the curtains and banishes them from the house. That night, the children sneak outside and discover that the headstones in the cemetery belong to the servants. The children retreat in fear when they see the servants approach. Meanwhile, Grace finds a photograph that has fallen out of the Book of the Dead onto the floor under some furniture. It is a photograph of the corpses of the three servants. The children run upstairs and hide in the bedroom where they are discovered by the elderly woman. Mrs. Mills returns to the house and tells Grace to go upstairs and talk to the intruders. Grace discovers that the old woman is in fact a medium in a s√©ance with Victor's parents, who has found out via automatic writing that Grace smothered the children to death with a pillow in a fit of despair before committing suicide. Grace realizes that \\"the others\\" are the family that has moved into the house, and that she, her young children and the three servants are all dead (the servants since 1891 and Grace and the children some time in the very recent past, her fit of despair presumably due to finding out her husband had died fighting in WWII). Following this display of supernatural and spiritual activity, Victor and his family vacate the house and leave it in the occupancy of the spirits of its predecessors. However, due to the fact that they are dead, Anne and Nicholas' spirits are finally allowed to play in the sun. Mrs. Mills informs the Stewarts that others will come back to the house and they will have to learn to coexist together, but Grace ominously states that the house is theirs. As she says this, more \\"For Sale\\" signs are posted outside. Cast Production The production crew visited Penshurst Place in Kent to film at the Lime Walk in the gardens. The Lime Walk was used in the scene where Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) went looking for a priest in the thick fog and instead met her husband who had returned from the war. Filming locations are, among other spots, Palacio de los Hornillos in Las Fraguas, Cantabria, Northern Spain, and in Madrid. Reception =Box office= The Others was released August 10, 2001 in 1,678 theaters in the United States and Canada and grossed $14 million its opening weekend, ranking fourth at the box office. It stayed in fourth for three more weeks, expanding to more theaters. During the weekend of September 21‚Äì23, it was second at the box office, grossing $5 million in 2,801 theaters. The film, which cost $17 million to produce, eventually grossed $96.5 million in the United States and Canada and $113.4 million in other countries, for a worldwide total gross of $209.9 million. =Critical reception= Many critics praised the performances of the stars especially Nicole Kidman as Grace Stewart. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an 83% approval rating based on 162 reviews, with an average rating of 7.2/10. The website's consensus reads, \\"The Others is a spooky thriller that reminds us that a movie doesn't need expensive special effects to be creepy.\\" On Metacritic, the film had an average score of 74 out of 100, based on 29 reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars out of four, praising that \\"...Alejandro Amen√°bar has the patience to create a languorous, dreamy atmosphere, and Nicole Kidman succeeds in convincing us that she is a normal person in a disturbing situation and not just a standard- issue horror movie hysteric.\\" However, he noted that \\"in drawing out his effects, Amen√°bar is a little too confident that style can substitute for substance.\\" Although the film deals primarily with the spiritual interaction of ghosts with each other rather than with living humans, William Skidelsky of The Observer has suggested that it was inspired by the 1898 novella The Turn of the Screw written by Henry James.Skidelsky, Will. \\"Classics corner: The Turn of the Screw,\\" The Observer (29 May 2010). =Accolades= * Goya Awards: ** Best Cinematography (Javier Aguirresarobe) ** Best Director (Alejandro Amen√°bar) ** Best Editing (Nacho Ruiz Capillas) ** Best Film ** Best Production Design ** Best Production Supervision ** Best Original Screenplay (Alejandro Amen√°bar) ** Best Sound * Kansas City Film Critics Circle Awards: ** Best Actress (Nicole Kidman) * London Film Critics: ** Best Actress of the Year (Nicole Kidman) * Online Film Critics: ** Best Actress (Nicole Kidman) ** Best Original Screenplay (Alejandro Amen√°bar) * Saturn Awards: ** Best Actress (Nicole Kidman) **Best Supporting Actress (Fionnula Flanagan) ** Best Horror Film Planned remake In April 2020, it was announced that Sentient Entertainment had acquired the remake rights to the film.

Frank Baum's Oz series of children's books, and works derived from them. His name is pronounced with a long \\"O\\", a homophone of \\"toe toe\\". He was originally a small terrier drawn by W. W. Denslow for the first edition of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900). He reappears in numerous adaptations, such as The Wizard of Oz (1939), The Wiz (1978) and Return to Oz (1985). Books =The classic books= Illustration by W. W. Denslow Toto belongs to Dorothy Gale, the heroine of the first and many subsequent books. In the first book, he never spoke, although other animals, native to Oz, did. In subsequent books, other animals gained the ability to speak upon reaching Oz or similar lands, but he remained speechless. In Tik-Tok of Oz, continuity is restored: he reveals that he is able to talk, just like other animals in the Land of Oz, and simply chooses not to. In The Lost Princess of Oz, he often talks continuously. Other major appearances include The Road to Oz, The Emerald City of Oz, Grampa in Oz and The Magical Mimics in Oz, in which he is the first to recognize the Mimics. In The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, Baum did not specifically state Toto's breed, but wrote \\"he was a little black dog with long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on either side of his funny, wee nose.\\" However, from the illustrations in the first book many have concluded that he is a Cairn Terrier while others believe he is a Yorkshire Terrier as this breed was very popular at the time and it fits the illustration quite well. In subsequent books he becomes a Boston Terrier for reasons that are never explained, but then resumes the earlier look in later books. =Later works= In Gregory Maguire's novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West, Toto is a minor character who is only described as being vile and annoying. In the musical adaption Wicked, he is only mentioned briefly when Glinda mistakenly calls him \\"Dodo\\". Films =Terry and the MGM film= Terry as Toto with Judy Garland in The Wizard of Oz (1939) In the 1939 movie The Wizard of Oz, Toto was played by a female brindle Cairn Terrier named Terry. She was paid a $125 salary each week, which was more than some of the human actors (the Singer Midgets who played the Munchkins reportedly received $50 to $100 a week). Terry/Toto's memorial at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery During production, Terry's foot was broken when one of the Winkie guards accidentally stepped on it. A second dog had to be used while she healed. Due to the popularity of the movie, and because that role was the one she was most remembered for, her owner and trainer changed her official name to Toto. She actually appeared in 13 films. She died at age 11. Willard Carroll wrote her \\"autobiography,\\" I, Toto (2001). When Terry died in 1945, Carl Spitz buried her on his ranch in Studio City, California. However, the construction of the Ventura Freeway in 1958 destroyed her grave. On June 18, 2011, a permanent memorial for her was dedicated at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Los Angeles. =Later film versions= * In Disney's 1985 movie Return to Oz, Toto was played by a female Border Terrier named Tansy. * The 1978 movie version of The Wiz featured a dark gray Schnauzer as Toto. * Toto appears in The Wizard of Oz cartoon with his vocal effects provided by Frank Welker. * In ABC's telefilm The Muppets' Wizard of Oz, he is played by Pepe the King Prawn. * In 1996 an animated series The Oz Kids, Dot and Neddie have a puppy named Toto 2 who is named after him. One of the episodes says it is a female. * In the VeggieTales episode \\"The Wonderful Wizard of Has\\", he is replaced by a pig named \\"Tutu\\". * In the Sci-Fi Channel miniseries Tin Man, he is portrayed as a shape-shifting human. He was originally the tutor of DG and her sister, and his name of \\"Toto\\" came from DG's childhood inability to say \\"Tutor\\". He was played by Blu Mankuma. * Toto also appears in the film Inkheart. In it, Silvertongues have the ability to bring a character from book to life by saying the words loud and clear. Meggy accidentally brings Toto out of the book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and he becomes her companion (until he's sent back into it at the end). He helps defeat the evil shadow monster as well. * In the Disney Channel original movie The Cheetah Girls the main character has a dog named Toto. This name is given to him most likely because one of the characters is named Dorothea (Dorothy). However, this dog is a Bichon Frise instead of a black Cairn Terrier. * Toto appeared in Dorothy and the Witches of Oz. He lived with Dorothy even when she was invited to New York City to get her books published. * Toto appeared in Legends of Oz: Dorothy's Return. * Toto is a German Shepherd in NBC's television series Emerald City. Initially a police dog that was in the police car Dorothy retreated to during the initial tornado that sent her to Oz, he is subsequently \\"adopted\\" by her in her journey through Oz. His name in Kansas is unknown, but he is named by Dorothy after the Munja'kin word for \\"dog\\". * Toto appears in the TV series Lost in Oz, voiced by Chris Cox. * Toto appears in the TV series Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz. * Toto appears in The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part. Alongside Dorothy and her friends, Toto found himself somehow transported from the Land of Oz to Harmony Town in the Systar System. * On July 12, 2018, it was announced that Warner Animation Group will produce an animated movie about Toto. It will be based on the children's book Toto: The Dog-Gone Amazing Story of The Wizard of Oz. Video games =Wizard101= In Wizard101, Toto is adapted as Mr. Toto, a dog man that appears to resemble a terrier. In the sidequest \\"Not in Kansas Anymore\\", players meet Dorothy Gale, who asks them to check up on her friends Mr. Toto and the Tin Man, who she was having over dinner. Toto tells them that they haven't left yet because Tin Man couldn't find his oil can, and that he is afraid of seizing up on the way to Dorothy's house. Toto then tells the player to tell Dorothy that they are simply running \\"late as usual\\". Influence Members of the American rock band Toto have said the band was named after the dog. Though it was perhaps the original source for the name appearing on their demo tapes, they chose their name based upon the meaning of the Latin word toto (\\"all-encompassing\\").Metzger, Greg. Rock Band Name Origins, p. 200. McFarland, 2008. TOTO is a backronym for 'TOtable Tornado Observatory', adapted from the name of Dorothy's dog from The Wizard of Oz. It is an in situ instrument for recording data from tornadoes.

Also known as Whitman Comics, Gold Key operated from 1962 to 1984. History Gold Key Comics was created in 1962, when its parent company Western Publishing switched to in-house publishing rather than packaging content for branding and distribution by its business partner, Dell Comics. Hoping to make their comics more like traditional children's books, they initially eliminated panel line-borders, using just the panel, with its ink and artwork evenly edged but not bordered by a \\"container\\" line. Within a year they had reverted to using inked panel borders and oval balloons. They experimented with new formats, including Whitman Comic Book, a black-and-white 136 page hardcover series consisting of reprints, and Golden Picture Story Book, a tabloid-sized 52-page hardcover containing new material. In 1967, Gold Key reprinted a number of selected issues of their comics under the title Top Comics. They were packaged in plastic bags containing five comics each and were sold at gas stations and various eateries. Like Dell, Gold Key was one of the few major American comic book publishers never to display the Comics Code Authority seal on its covers. =Properties= Gold Key featured a number of licensed properties and several original titles, including a number of publications that spun off from Dell's Four Color series, or were published as stand alone titles. Gold Key maintained decent sales numbers throughout the 1960s, thanks to its offering of many titles based upon popular TV series of the day, as well as numerous titles based upon both Walt Disney Studios and Warner Bros. animated properties. It was also the first company to publish comic books based upon the NBC series Star Trek. While some titles, such as Star Trek and The Twilight Zone, were published for many years, many other licensed titles were characterized by short runs, sometimes publishing no more than one or two issues. Gold Key considered suing over the similarly themed television series Lost in Space for its resemblance to the preexisting Space Family Robinson, but decided their business relationship with CBS and Irwin Allen was more important than any monetary reward resulting from such a suit; as a result, the Gold Key series adopted the branding Space Family Robinson Lost in Space with issue #15 (Jan. 1966), even though its narrative had no connection to the TV series.Space Family Robinson Lost in Space at the Grand Comics Database. Editor Chase Craig stated that Gold Key would launch titles with Hanna-Barbera characters with direct adaptations of episodes of the program because \\"[t]he studio had approval rights and the people there could get pointlessly picky about the material ... but they rarely bothered looking at any issue after the first few. Therefore, it simplified the procedure to do the first and maybe the second issue as an adaptation. They couldn't very well complain that a plot taken from the show was inappropriate\\". Over the years, it lost several properties, including the King Features Syndicate characters (Popeye, Flash Gordon, The Phantom, etc.), to Charlton Comics in 1966, numerous, but not all, Hanna-Barbera characters also to Charlton Comics in 1970, and Star Trek to Marvel Comics in 1979. =Creators= The stable of writers and artists built up by Western Publishing during the Dell Comics era mostly continued into the Gold Key era. In the mid-1960s, a number of artists were recruited by the newly formed Disney Studio Program and thereafter divided their output between the Disney Program and Western. Writer/artist Russ Manning and editor Chase Craig launched the Magnus, Robot Fighter science fiction series in 1963. Jack Sparling co-created the superhero Tiger Girl with Jerry Siegel in 1968, drew the toyline tie-in Microbots one-shot, and illustrated comic book adaptations of the television series Family Affair, The Outer Limits, and Adam-12. Dan Spiegle worked on Space Family Robinson, The Green Hornet, The Invaders, Korak, Son of Tarzan, Brothers of the Spear, and many of Gold Key's mystery/occult titles. Among the other creators at Gold Key were writers Donald F. Glut, Len Wein, Bob Ogle, John David Warner, Steve Skeates, and Mark Evanier; and artists Cliff Voorhees, Joe Messerli, Carol Lay, Jesse Santos, and Mike Royer. Glut created and wrote several series including The Occult Files of Dr. Spektor, Dagar the Invincible, and Tragg and the Sky Gods. Also in the 1970s, writer Bob Gregory started drawing stories, mostly for Daisy and Donald. Artist/writer Frank Miller had his first published comic book artwork in The Twilight Zone for Gold Key in 1978. Diana Gabaldon began her career writing for Gold Key, initially sending a query that stated \\"I‚Äôve been reading your comics for the last 25 years, and they‚Äôve been getting worse and worse. I‚Äôm not sure if I could do better myself, but I‚Äôd like to try.\\" Editor Del Connell provided a script sample and bought her second submission. According to former Western Publishing writer Mark Evanier, during the mid-1960s comedy writer Jerry Belson, whose writing partner at the time was Garry Marshall, also did scripts for Gold Key while writing for leading TV sitcoms like The Dick Van Dyke Show. Among the comics he wrote for were The Flintstones, Uncle Scrooge, Daffy Duck, Bugs Bunny, The Three Stooges, and Woody Woodpecker. Leo Dorfman, creator of Ghosts for DC Comics, also produced supernatural stories for Gold Key's similarly themed Twilight Zone, Ripley's Believe it or Not, Boris Karloff Tales of Mystery, and Grimm's Ghost Stories. One of Gold Key's editors at the time told Mark Evanier, \\"Leo writes stories and then he decides whether he's going to sell them to DC [for Ghosts] or to us. He tells us that if they come out good, they go to us and if they don't, they go to DC. I assume he tells DC the opposite.\\" Editor Frank Tedeschi, who left in 1973 for a job in book publishing, helped bring in such new comics professionals as Walt Simonson, Gerry Boudreau, and John David Warner. =Later years= The comics industry experienced a downswing in the 1970s and Gold Key was among the hardest hit. Its editorial policies had not kept pace with the changing times and suffered an erosion of its base of sales among children, who could now watch cartoons and other entertainment on television for free instead. It is also alleged by Carmine Infantino that in the mid-to-late 1960s DC Comics attempted to pressure Gold Key from the comics business through sheer weight of output. Among the original titles launched by Gold Key in the 1970s were Baby Snoots and Wacky Witch. By 1977 many of the company's series had been cancelled and the surviving titles featured more reprinted material, although Gold Key was able to obtain the rights to publish a comic book series based upon Buck Rogers in the 25th Century between 1979 and 1981. It also lost the rights to publish Star Trek-based comic books to Marvel Comics just prior to the revival of the franchise via Star Trek: The Motion Picture, with the final Gold Key-published Star Trek title being issued in March 1979. In this period, Gold Key experimented with digests with some success. In a similar manner, to explore new markets, in the mid-1970s it produced a four-volume series, with somewhat better production values and printing aimed at the emerging collector market, containing classic stories of the Disney characters by Carl Barks and Floyd Gottfredson (Best of Walt Disney's Comics). In the late 1970s came somewhat higher grade reprints of various licensed characters also aimed at new venues (Dynabrites), plus Starstream, a four-issue series adapting classic science fiction stories by authors such as Isaac Asimov and John W. Campbell. Golden Press released trade paperback reprint collections such as Walt Disney Christmas Parade, Bugs Bunny Comics-Go-Round,Bugs Bunny Comics-Go-Round at the Grand Comics Database and Star Trek: The Enterprise Logs. In the late 1970s, the distribution of comic books on spinners and racks at newsstands, drug stores and supermarkets continued, but Western also sold packs of three comics in a plastic bag to toy and department stores, airports, and bus/train stations, \\"as well as other outlets that weren't conducive to conventional comic racks\\". The newsstand comics were returnable -- the dealer could return unsold copies to the distributor for a refund -- but the bagged comics were not. To discourage unscrupulous dealers from opening the plastic bags and returning the non-returnable issues, Western published the newsstand versions under the Gold Key Comics label, and put the Whitman Comics logo on the bagged versions, although otherwise the issues were identical. Western, at one point, also distributed bagged comics from its rival DC Comics under the Whitman logo. Former DC Comics Executive Paul Levitz stated that the \\"Western program was enormous ‚Äî even well into the 1970s they were taking very large numbers of DC titles for distribution (I recall 50,000+ copies offhand).\\" In 1979, Western ceased to be an independent company when Mattel Inc. purchased the company. The new management stopped selling returnable comics at newsstands, preferring the non-returnable bagged comics sold at toy stores. In a 1993 interview, Del Connell, the managing editor at Western's West Coast office in the late 1970s, recalled, Eventually arrangements were made to distribute these releases to the nascent national network of comic book stores. Western also prepared a prospectus in the early 1980s for a deluxe Carl Barks reprint project aimed at the collector market that was never published. In December 1983, a struggling Mattel sold Western Publishing to real estate investor Richard A. Bernstein. Bernstein closed the comic-book publishing division in 1984. =Relaunches, reprints, and legacy= Three of Gold Key's original characters, Magnus, Robot Fighter, Doctor Solar, and Turok, Son of Stone, were used in the 1990s to launch Valiant Comics' fictional universe. Dark Horse Comics (and later, Dynamite Entertainment) have published reprints, including several in hardcover collections, of such original Gold Key titles as Magnus, Robot Fighter; Doctor Solar; Mighty Samson; M.A.R.S. Patrol; Turok: Son of Stone; The Occult Files of Doctor Spektor; Dagar the Invincible; Boris Karloff's Tales of Mystery; Space Family Robinson; Flash Gordon; the Jesse Marsh drawn Tarzan; and some of the Russ Manning-produced Tarzan series. They started several revivals of characters under Jim Shooter, including Doctor Solar, Magnus, Turok, and Mighty Samson. The Checker Book Publishing Group, in conjunction with Paramount Pictures, began reprinting the Gold Key Star Trek series in 2004. Hermes Press reprinted the three series based on Irwin Allen's science-fiction TV series, as well as Gold Key's Dark Shadows, My Favorite Martian, and the Phantom. Bongo Comics published a parody of Gold Key in Radioactive Man #106 (volume 2 #6, Nov. 2002) with script/layout by Batton Lash and finished art by Mike DeCarlo that Tony Isabella dubbed \\"a nigh- flawless facsimile of the Gold Key comics published by Western in the early 1960s...from the painting with tasteful come-on copy on the front cover to the same painting, sans logo or other type, presented as a \\"pin-up\\" on the back cover\\". In 2001, Western Publishing, including the Gold Key properties, was bought by Classic Media. In 2012, Classic Media was purchased by DreamWorks Animation SKG and rebranded as DreamWorks Classics, who currently own the Gold Key properties. On April 28, 2016, NBCUniversal acquired DreamWorks Animation for $3.8 billion.

Career Delafontaine studied with Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac at the University of Geneva. He also worked at the University of Geneva. Delafontaine moved to the United States of America, arriving in New York in 1870, and later becoming a naturalized citizen. He taught in Chicago, Illinois at city high schools, and at a women's college. He also worked as analytical chemist with the Chicago Police Department. Research =Holmium= In 1878, along with Jacques-Louis Soret, Delafontaine first observed holmium spectroscopically. In 1879, Per Teodor Cleve chemically separated it from thulium and erbium. All three men are given credit for the element's discovery. =Yttrium, terbium and erbium= In 1843 Carl Gustaf Mosander discovered terbium and erbium as components of yttria. However, this discovery was hotly contested. Spectroscopist Nils Johan Berlin denied that the two elements existed, failing to confirm the existence of \\"erbia\\" and suggesting that its name be applied to \\"terbia\\". In 1864, Marc Delafontaine used optical spectroscopy to conclusively prove that yttrium, terbium and erbium were separate elements.

It is adapted from the last one-fifth of Bibhutibhushan Bannerjee's novel Pather Panchali (1929) and the first one- third of its sequel Aparajito (1932). It starts off where the previous film Pather Panchali (1955) ended, with Apu's family moving to Varanasi, and chronicles Apu's life from childhood to adolescence in college, right up to his mother's death, when he is left all alone. When Ray started making Pather Panchali, he had no plans of following it up with a sequel. The critical and commercial success of the film prompted him to start making Aparajito. Unlike his previous venture, where he stayed faithful to the novel, Ray took some bold artistic decisions here, such as portraying the relationship between Apu and his mother in a very different manner from the book. As a result, in contrast to its predecessor, the film was not received well locally; Ray recalled that \\"as for the suburban audience, it was shocked by the portrayal of the mother and son relationship, so sharply at variance with the conventional notion of mutual sweetness and devotion\\". Critical reception outside of India, however, was overwhelmingly positive. It won 11 international awards, including the Golden Lion and Critics Award at the Venice Film Festival, becoming the first ever film to win both. Veteran film- maker Mrinal Sen said he considers it to be one of the best Indian movies he had ever seen. Bosley Crowther said that \\"It is done with such rare feeling and skill at pictorial imagery, and with such sympathetic understanding of Indian character on the part of Mr. Ray, that it develops a sort of hypnotism for the serene and tolerant viewer.\\" The critical acclaim this movie received encouraged Ray to make another sequel, Apur Sansar (1959), which was equally well received, and thus concluded one of the most critically acclaimed movie trilogies of all time, as Roger Ebert later pointed out‚Äî\\"The three films ... swept the top prizes at Cannes, Venice and London, and created a new cinema for India ‚Äî whose prolific film industry had traditionally stayed within the narrow confines of swashbuckling musical romances. Never before had one man had such a decisive impact on the films of his culture.\\" Plot summary In 1920, Apu (Pinaki Sen Gupta) and his parents, who have left their home in rural Bengal, have settled into an apartment in Varanasi where his father Harihar (Kanu Banerjee) works as a priest. Harihar is making headway in his new pursuits: praying, singing, and officiating among the ghats on the sacred river Ganges. Harihar catches a fever and soon dies, however, and his wife Sarbajaya (Karuna Banerjee) is forced to begin work as a maid. With the assistance of a great-uncle, Apu and his mother return to Bengal and settle in the village Mansapota. There Apu apprentices as a priest, but pines to attend the local school which his mother is persuaded to allow. He excels at his studies, impressing a visiting dignitary, and the headmaster takes special interest in him. Within a few years, the teenaged Apu (now played by Smaran Ghosal) has done well enough to receive a scholarship to go to Kolkata for further studies. Sarbajaya feels abandoned and frightened by this, but gives in and lovingly packs his suitcase. Apu travels by train to the city and starts working at a printing press, after school hours, to subsist. He becomes more accustomed to the city life and feels out of place in the village. Sarbajaya expects visits from him, but he visits only a few times. Her loneliness and yearning for her son continue to grow. She becomes seriously ill, but does not disclose her illness to Apu, lest his studies get disturbed. When Apu finally comes to know about her poor health, he returns to the village to find that she has died. Bhabataran, Apu's great uncle, requests that he stay there and perform last rites of his mother. Apu replies that he will perform the last rites in Kolkata and starts his journey back to the city.

The novel Pather Panchali is a classic bildungsroman (a type of coming-of-age story) in the canon of Bengali literature. It first appeared as a serial in a Calcutta periodical in 1928 and was published as a book the next year. According to Ray's biographer, Robinson, among the three films of the Apu trilogy, Aparajito bears the closest resemblance with its literary source. Banerjee's depiction of the mother-son relation fascinated Ray. Robinson writes: \\"Their relationship had some echoes on a purely psychological plane for him\\". Ray was in particular moved by Banerjee's \\"daring and profound revelation\\", that \\"for some time after Sarbajaya's death Apu becomes familiar with a strange sensation...his immediate reaction had been one of pleasure, like a surge of release...a delight in the breaking of bonds...there was no doubt he loved his mother, but the news of her death had at first brought him pleasure‚Äîhe couldn't avoid the truth.\\" Ray's wife Bijoya also voiced her concerns when she came to know the plot, asking him \\"Do you think people in our country will accept a son's relief at having won his freedom at his mother's death?\\" Ray was aware of the risk, saying \\"let's see what happens. After all, later Apu was full of regret at his initial reaction upon his mother's death. And as he realized, her death actually came as a very big blow to him.\\" =Script and crew= The novels had a female character named Leela who influenced Apu's alienation from his mother when he was living in Calcutta. After rejecting two aspirants, Ray found one actress to portray the character, but the actress was not allowed to act in the film by her fianc√©. Eventually, Ray removed the character from the script reluctantly. Ray himself later commented that he thought Leela, with whom Apu had an understated affair, was a strong reason behind Apu's attraction of Calcutta, and that without Leela's presence in the film, Apu's attraction to Calcutta may seem to some extent artificial. \\"I'm never sure,\\" he said, \\"whether Apu's attachment to the city without the element of the girlfriend is strong enough, the pull that the city exerts is a bit abstract.\\" However, when he watched the movie later, he did not feel the absence of Leela. Subrata Mitra, the cinematographer for The Apu Trilogy, made his first technical innovation with this film: the introduction of bounce lighting. According to the Internet Encyclopedia of Cinematographers: > The fear of monsoon rain had forced the art director, Bansi Chandragupta, to > abandon the original plan to build the inner courtyard of a typical Benares > house in the open and the set was built inside a studio in Calcutta. Mitra > recalls arguing in vain with both Chandragupta and Ray about the > impossibilities of simulating shadowless diffused skylight. But this led him > to innovate what became subsequently his most important tool‚Äîbounce > lighting. Mitra placed a framed painter white cloth over the set resembling > a patch of sky and arranged studio lights below to bounce off the fake sky. Critical reception The film has been enthusiastically received by critics. James Berardinelli wrote: > Aparajito was filmed forty years ago, half way around the world, yet the > themes and emotions embedded in the narrative are strikingly relevant to > modern Western society (thus explaining why it is called a \\"timeless > classic\\")....Aparajito is an amazing motion picture.

Reel Reviews URL accessed on 3 April 2006 Roger Ebert said, \\"the relationship between Apu and his mother observes truths that must exist in all cultures: how the parent makes sacrifices for years, only to see the child turn aside and move thoughtlessly away into adulthood....It is about a time, place and culture far removed from our own, and yet it connects directly and deeply with our human feelings. It is like a prayer, affirming that this is what the cinema can be, no matter how far in our cynicism we may stray.\\" During the Venice Film Festival, Penelope Houston, who was among the jury, broke protocol and told Ray personally: \\"I think it was magnificent\\". The chairman of the award ceremony, Ren√© Clair, was initially reluctant to give it the coveted prize; he eventually acquiesced, but not before saying to Houston: \\"I hope Ray will go away and learn how to make films!\\" The Japanese director Akira Kurosawa had an important film entered in that year's festival competition, Throne of Blood (Kumonosu-j≈ç), which lost to Ray's film. However, many years later, Kurosawa's daughter generated a list of 100 films admired by him; this list quoted him as having affirmed the jury's choice as \\"ABSOLUTELY right\\" (though he misidentified the winning film as Pather Panchali). Emanuel Levy said: \\"Made in 1956 (and released in many countries a year later), 'Aparajito' indicates India‚Äôs processes of modernization and industrialization and their inevitable impact on both individual and culture. Nonetheless, in his upbeat outlook, Ray suggests that individuals can rise to the occasion and might not be compromised by the corruption that characterizes the society at large.\\" Bosley Crowther, who had earlier given a lukewarm response to Pather Panchali, saying that the film was so amateurish that \\"it would barely pass for a rough cut in Hollywood\\", praised it, saying that \\"Mr. Ray's remarkable camera catches beauty in so many things, from the softness of a mother's sad expression to the silhouette of a distant train, that innuendos take up the slack of drama. Hindu music and expressive natural sounds complete the stimulation of the senses in this strange, sad, evocative film.\\" At Rotten Tomatoes, Aparajito has a 94% fresh rating based on an aggregate of 18 reviews with an average rating of 8.7/10. Awards and nominations Aparajito won the Golden Lion at the 1957 Venice Film Festival and, to date, remains the only film sequel to ever win the grand prize at the prestigious Venice, Berlin or Cannes Film Festivals. Along with the Golden Lion, it received the Cinema Nuovo Award and the FIPRESCI Award Critics Award in the process becoming the first movie to win all three. Ray also won the Golden Gate awards for Best Picture and Best Director at the San Francisco International Film Festival in 1958, along with the Critics Award for this film. The film won the Bodil Award for Best Non- European Film of the Year at Denmark in 1967. It won the Selznick Golden Laurel for Best Film at the Berlin International Film Festival It also received the FIPRESCI Award and Wington Award at the British Film Institute Awards at London Film Festival The film was nominated for the Best Film and Best Foreign Actress at the 1959 British Academy Film Awards. Accolades and legacy In 1992, Sight & Sound (the British Film Institute's film magazine) ranked The Apu Trilogy at No. 88 in its Critics' Poll of all-time greatest films, while Aparajito itself was ranked separately at No. 127 on the same list. In 2002, a combined list of Sight & Sound critics' and directors' poll results included Aparajito in its top 160. In 1998, the Asian film magazine Cinemayas critics' poll of all-time greatest films ranked The Apu Trilogy at No. 7 on the list. In 1999, The Village Voice ranked The Apu Trilogy at No. 54 in its Top 250 \\"Best Films of the Century\\" list, based on a poll of critics. In 2001, film critic Roger Ebert included The Apu Trilogy in his list of \\"100 Great Movies\\" of all time. In 2005, The Apu Trilogy was included in Time magazine's All-TIME 100 Greatest Movies list. Smaran Ghosal who played the role of adolescent Apu, at the age of 14, did only one more film, documentary Rabindranath Tagore (1961), also made by Ray, where he played young Rabindranath Tagore. Smaran died in 2008 in Kolkata, at the age of 64. Aparajito was preceded by Pather Panchali (1955) and followed by Apur Sansar (The World of Apu) in 1959. Together, the three films constitute the Apu trilogy. Pather Panchali portrays the childhood of Apu in their ancestral house. Apur Sansar depicts Apu's adult life, his reaction to his wife's premature death, and his final bonding with his son whom he abandoned as an infant. Ray did not initially plan to make a trilogy: he decided to make the third film only after being asked about the possibility of a trilogy at the 1957 Venice Film Festival, where Aparajito won the Golden Lion. The film is considered as the richest of three in terms of its characterization. Apur Panchali (2014) is a Bengali film directed by Kaushik Ganguly, which depicts the real-life story of Subir Bannerjee, the actor who portrayed Apu in Pather Panchali. According to Michael Sragow of The Atlantic Monthly in 1994, \\"The youthful coming-of-age dramas that have flooded art houses since the mid- fifties owe a tremendous debt to the Apu trilogy, which Terrence Rafferty has rightly called 'cinema's purest Bildungsroman'.\\" Across the world, filmmakers such as Martin Scorsese, James Ivory, Abbas Kiarostami, Elia Kazan and Wes Anderson have been influenced by The Apu Trilogy, with many others (such as Kurosawa) praising the work. The technique of bounce lighting developed by the cinematographer Subrata Mitra for Aparajito has also had a profound influence on the development of cinematography. After Aparajito, Ray went on to make 35 more films, including feature films, documentaries and shorts. He worked on scripting, casting, scoring, cinematography, art direction, editing and designing his own credit titles and publicity material. He developed a distinctive style of film-making based on visual lyricism and strong humanism, as in his Apu trilogy. Thus Ray established himself as an auteur of cinema. Preservation The Academy Film Archive preserved the entire Apu Trilogy in 1996, including Aparajito.

He studied both spectroscopy and electrolysis. He held the chairs of chemistry (1873-1887) and medical physics (1887-1890) at the University of Geneva. Soret determined the chemical composition and density of ozone and the conditions for its production. He described it correctly as being composed of three oxygen atoms bound together. Soret also developed optical instruments. He climbed Mont Blanc, where he was the first scientist to make actinometric measurements of solar radiation. These observations were published in the Philosophical Magazine in 1867. In 1878, he and Marc Delafontaine were the first to spectroscopically observe the element later named holmium, which they identified simply as an \\"earth X\\" derived from \\"erbia\\". Independently, Per Teodor Cleve separated it chemically from thulium and erbium in 1879. All three researchers are given credit for the element's discovery. The Soret peak or Soret band, a strong absorption band at approximately 420 nm in the absorption spectra of hemoglobin, is also named after him. Jacques-Louis Soret died in Geneva on 13 May 1890. His son was Charles Soret, a recognized physicist and chemist in his own right.

Ostensibly an adaptation of Biblical passages from the Book of Revelation, the album is the most critically acclaimed Aphrodite's Child album. It was also the group's last album, due to internal tensions during the recording process and conflict with the record company. By the time it was released, the band had already disbanded and its members begun working on solo projects. Conception and production The concept for 666 was created by Vangelis and film director Costas Ferris, who served as the project's lyricist. Ferris cited as influences the nonlinear narrative style of films Intolerance, Rashomon, Citizen Kane and The Killing, as well as the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and the Who's Tommy. The central concept is a countercultural interpretation of the Book of Revelation, in which a circus show based on the apocalypse performs for an audience at the same time that the real apocalypse takes place outside the circus tent, and at the end the two merge into one. Ferris described the result as a \\"concept book\\", and stated that he intended for the narration to be looser than Tommy, but more rigid than Sgt. Pepper. The band commenced work on the album at the Europa Sonor studio in Paris in late 1970. They took just over three months to record it and finished in early 1971. The overall cost of album's recording was estimated as $80,000 or $90,000. The recording was marked by tension, as the ambitious nature of Vangelis and Ferris' concept clashed with Demis Roussos, Loukas Sideras and Silver Koulouris' wish to continue with the psychedelic pop direction that had brought them success. Vangelis, Roussos and Sideras were also accompanied by their partners, further adding to the strain. Engineer Roger Roche reported that they enjoyed playing together but would not speak to each other after they finished a take. Vangelis blamed commercial pressures for the tensions, stating, \\"It was too sophisticated for the group. I realised that I couldn't follow the commercial way anymore, it was very boring.\\" Giorgio Gomelsky, in France at the time due to his work with Magma and Gong, made several contributions to the album and by his own description served as \\"a sort of 'acting producer'\\". He believed that his contributions were not enough to warrant a producer's credit. Accordingly, on the album sleeve, he is credited as \\"passing by\\". Gerard Fallec, credited on the sleeve with \\"production coordination\\", did not play a part in the production process, but became involved during the year-long battle to have the record released. Ferris credited him with suggesting the album's final title and working on its sleeve. Additional contributors to the album included Harris Halkitis, who had filled in for Vangelis when the band toured in support of It's Five O'Clock, horn player Michel Ripoche, Greek painter Yannis Tsarouchis, actress Irene Papas, John Forst and Daniel Koplowitz. Upon the album's completion, Mercury Records refused to release it, objecting to its uncommercial material and in particular the song \\"‚àû\\". In 1971, the band organised a \\"one-year anniversary party\\" at Europa Sonor, to protest the album not being released. According to Ferris, Salvador Dal√≠ was in attendance at the party, and listened to the album. Dal√≠ was highly impressed with the work, stating that it reminded him of the Sagrada Fam√≠lia, and planned an ambitious happening in Barcelona to mark the album's release. The plan was canceled when Dal√≠ angrily broke off further contact after a friend of Ferris' referred to Gala Dal√≠ as \\"Madame √âluard\\" during a visit in Rome. Despite Vangelis editing \\"‚àû\\" from its original 39 minutes to merely five, the band continued to struggle with Mercury's obstruction. During this period, the band drifted apart. Vangelis released his first solo album Fais que ton r√™ve soit plus long que la nuit. Sideras began work on his own solo album, One Day, which featured arrangements by Koulouris. Roussos released his debut solo album Fire and Ice (also known as On the Greek Side of My Mind), obtaining a hit single in Europe with the song \\"We Shall Dance\\". Eventually, Mercury agreed to release 666 on its progressive rock subsidiary Vertigo Records in June 1972. The album was promoted with one single, \\"Babylon\\"/\\"Break\\", released in November. Mercury also produced a four- song EP to encourage radio play, and ran a contest where they would give $666 to the first three promoters who could get their market's share of 40.000 sales. Although Melody Maker stated that \\"Break\\" \\"could easily have made the chart if it had been released as a single\\", neither the album nor single were commercially successful on release, the album failing to chart and the single only entering the Dutch charts at #24. Two years later, Vangelis said that the album sold well in the US. Vertigo also released a single vinyl edition of the album in Brazil, titled Break and leaving out most of the album's instrumental songs. An extended vinyl edition of 666 was released in Greece in 1974, containing alternative mixes of songs with music cut from other versions of the album, and using a gatefold sleeve displaying the painting originally on the inner sleeve. Some of these versions had appeared on the Brazilian release. Songs The music of 666 is more ambitious and experimental than previous Aphrodite's Child releases, containing greater use of electronic keyboards, studio experimentation, expanded instrumentation, and influences from genres such as jazz, musique concr√®te and world music. Reflecting this character, only six of the album's 24 songs have vocals and lyrics, four by lead singer Demis Roussos and two by Loukas Sideras. The rest are either instrumental, instrumentals with narration, or use vocals as an instrument. Although the album's material is often acknowledged as challenging and uncommercial, it has also been described as tuneful, \\"fun\\", and retaining elements of pop music. Authors Paul Hegarty and Martin Halliwell interpreted the album as reflecting \\"the turmoil in Greece at the time\\", while Vangelis argued that its theme was highly relevant in general, stating in Sounds in 1974, \\"The answer to the question 666 is today.\\" The Mojo Collection argues that \\"the album's lush arrangements were as startling as any of the progressive era and have aged better than most\\", in part due to Vangelis not relying excessively on contemporary synthesizers and the prominent role of guitarist Silver Koulouris. =Side one= The first song on the album, \\"The System\\", fades in with a choir chanting \\"We got the system, to fuck the system!\\" and a drum roll by Loukas Sideras. The lyric is inspired by Abbie Hoffman's pamphlet Fuck the System. \\"Babylon\\" is an acoustic rock song with an energetic guitar riff that Head Heritage compared to Pete Townshend's work on \\"Pinball Wizard\\", melodic bass playing by Roussos, and crowd noise similar to that of Sgt. Pepper. The lyrics introduce the apocalyptic theme by referring to the fall of Babylon the Great from Revelation 18. \\"Loud, Loud, Loud\\" combines a two-chord piano melody by Vangelis with narration by Daniel Koplowitz, described by a fansite as \\"the son of [a] diplomat\\". The title is sung by a choir, who are not credited on the album sleeve. The narration reflects a spirit of countercultural optimism, speaking of \\"The day young boys will stop becoming soldiers/And soldiers will stop playing war games\\". \\"The Four Horsemen\\" deals with the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, its lyrics mostly paraphrasing the text of Revelation 6. The song's structure is marked by a dynamic contrast, with Roussos singing over an echoed keyboard drone and wind chimes in the verses, and the chorus containing traditional rock instrumentation highlighted by Sideras' drumming. The song culminates in a two-minute wah guitar solo by Koulouris over heavy drumming by Sideras and a repeated \\"fa fa fa\\" background chant by Roussos. One of the best known songs of 666, \\"The Four Horsemen\\" influenced Beck's \\"Chemtrails\\", which has a similar structure, and The Verve's \\"The Rolling People\\", which quoted the \\"fa fa fa\\" chant. The chorus was also sampled, in a slowed-down fashion, on Daniel Lopatin's \\"A7\\", from Chuck Person's Eccojams Vol. 1. \\"The Lamb\\" is a world music-influenced instrumental, featuring vocal chants following the main melody, and sounds reminiscent of traditional Greek instruments. \\"The Seventh Seal\\" is an instrumental with a repeated keyboard and string instrument melody, and British-accented narration by John Forst describing the lamb opening the last of the Seven seals, again based on Revelation 6. The narration does not mention the earthquake that the Book of Revelation attributes to the breaking of the sixth seal, but is otherwise faithful to the biblical description. Forst's line, \\"And when the lamb opened the seventh seal, silence covered the sky\\" was sampled in the Enigma song, \\"The Rivers of Belief\\". =Side two= Side two begins with \\"Aegian Sea\\", an instrumental featuring another lengthy guitar solo by Koulouris, elaborate keyboard work by Vangelis, and wordless vocalising. Narration by John Forst is included under Koulouris' guitar solo, restating the breaking of the two seals in \\"The Seventh Seal\\" in first person, and featuring three repetitions of the phrase \\"They'll no more suffer from hunger, they'll no more suffer from thirst\\". Forst's narration is slowed down in pitch and panned to the right stereo channel, with echo being heard on the left channel. \\"Aegian Sea\\" is followed by \\"Seven Bowls\\", a sound effect-laden piece in which a chorus narrates the effects of the seven bowls (changing the Euphrates drying up and earthquake of the last two bowls to the stars going out and the air turning to poison), which in turn crossfades into the eerie instrumental \\"The Wakening Beast\\", which uses reverbed wind chimes. The narration of \\"Seven Bowls\\" was sampled on the Enigma song \\"The Voice and the Snake\\". \\"Lament\\" begins with a repeated vibraphone note played by Vangelis, followed by Roussos singing a lament for \\"the human race\\" over a minimal backing. Vangelis provides additional backing vocals, which reflect his interest in Byzantine music. \\"The Marching Beast\\" is an instrumental piece with a repeated melody played on guitar, bass and saxophone, with a gradually developing arrangement that includes a piano solo and a Jethro Tull-influenced flute trill. \\"The Battle of the Locusts\\" and \\"Do It\\" are aggressive rock instrumentals, variously perceived by reviewers as being influenced by jazz and heavy metal. Both begin with Forst reciting their titles, and are played in a power trio format, with intricate drumming and rapid guitar solos. The title of \\"Do It\\" comes from Jerry Rubin's book DO IT!: Scenarios of the Revolution. Both songs were compared by Head Heritage to \\"Ash Ra Tempel meets Santana\\". \\"Tribulation\\" is a jazz-influenced instrumental with overdubbed saxophone by Harris Halkitis. \\"The Beast\\" has been described as a \\"bizarre funky singalong\\". It is the first song with lead vocals by Loukas Sideras, who sings \\"Who can fight the beast?\\" in his normal voice and \\"She's big/She's bad/She's wicked/She's sad\\" in a deeper, lower voice. The song features a funk-influenced rhythm and studio experimentation, with the first snare hit of the verses having plate reverb applied to it. During recording, Vangelis had a microphone in order to direct the band, and the final mix of the song includes some of his rhythmic scat singing and studio commentary. He says Pame! (\\"Let's go!\\") near the song's climax, and Teliounome edho pera, etsi? (\\"We're closing here, remember?\\") on the song's final measure. Reviewer Jon Bryan considered the song \\"a little kooky\\" but \\"fun and memorable\\". The last song on the second side, \\"Ofis\\", is a brief interlude in which Yiannis Tsarouchis recites a line from the shadow puppet play Alexander the Great and the Accursed Serpent with slapback echo applied to his voice. The line, , translates to \\"Come out, cursed serpent, because if you don't come out yourself, I will make you come out!\\". =Side three= \\"Seven Trumpets\\" is a dramatic narration that serves to introduce \\"Altamont\\". Head Heritage interpreted it to represent the moment where the \\"curtain of reality\\" is torn down, and thus the real apocalypse and the circus show apocalypse begin to intertwine as per Ferris' concept. \\"Altamont\\", chosen as one of the highlights of the album by AllMusic, contains a repetitive funk-influenced groove, Roussos scatting along with the bassline, vibraphone by Vangelis, and overdubbed horns by Halkitis. The second half of the song introduces additional narration, referring to the imagery of previous songs and describing the sight of the apocalypse as \\"the pictures of what was, of what is, of what has to come\\". One of the lines of the narration, \\"We are the people/The rolling people\\", later inspired the title of The Verve's \\"The Rolling People\\". \\"Altamont\\" ends by crossfading into \\"The Wedding of the Lamb\\", a world music-influenced instrumental that contains an electronic keyboard melody backed by wordless vocalising and syncopated, rhythmic drumming. The instrumental in turn crossfades into \\"The Capture of the Beast\\", a drum solo by Sideras that makes heavy use of toms and percussion instruments, performed over Vangelis' keyboard drones and effects. The songs are linked together by brief spoken lines recited in a halting manner which announce their titles, \\"That was 'The Wedding of the Lamb'\\" at the end of the former, and \\"Now comes 'The Capture of the Beast'\\" at the beginning of the latter. \\"‚àû\\" (\\"Infinity\\"), the most controversial song on the album, consists of Irene Papas chanting \\"I was, I am, I am to come\\" over a sparse percussion track, gradually building into an orgasmic frenzy. Vangelis described the track as conveying \\"the pain of birth and the joy of intercourse.\\" Ferris originally sought a narrator with a heavy British accent to recite the lyric, in order to create a contrast with the climactic frenzy, but Papas' improvisation was chosen instead because it made a stronger impression. Hegarty and Halliwell describe the song as part of the \\"increased cacophony\\" that marks the progression towards the apocalypse. Melody Maker remarked in 1972 that in light of the publicity received by Serge Gainsbourg's \\"Je t'aime... moi non plus\\", it was \\"odd\\" that the media overlooked 666, but that it would have been a \\"pity\\" if it achieved notoriety solely due to Papas' contribution. A sample of Papas taking sharp breaths was used in Enigma's \\"Principles of Lust\\". \\"Hic et Nunc\\" (Latin for \\"here and now\\") is an upbeat pop song with phased piano, tenor saxophone by Michel Ripoche, a crowd chanting \\"Here and now!\\" in the chorus, a reuse of the audience sound effect from \\"Babylon\\" and the \\"We got the system to fuck the system\\" chant from \\"The System\\" during Vangelis' piano solo, foreshadowing the concluding \\"montage\\". =Side four= The longest song on the album, \\"All the Seats Were Occupied\\" begins as a slow raga-influenced instrumental before incorporating other genres such as funk and culminating in a musique concr√®te \\"montage\\" that incorporates samples from \\"Seven Trumpets\\", \\"The System\\", \\"The Four Horsemen\\", \\"Loud, Loud, Loud\\", \\"The Capture of the Beast\\", \\"Ofis\\", \\"‚àû\\", \\"Seven Bowls\\", \\"The Lamb\\", \\"The Wakening Beast\\", \\"The Marching Beast\\" and \\"Altamont\\". The sentence \\"all the seats were occupied\\" was taken from a BBC Teaching English record. The song concludes with a chaotic ending and a sample of Papas' pained groaning from \\"‚àû\\". This track was later included on the compilation album A Monstrous Psychedelic Bubble Exploding in Your Mind: Volume 3. \\"Break\\", the closing song, is a ballad sung by Sideras, backed by piano and organ. Vangelis scat sings backing vocals, meant to make fun of the song's dramatic mood. Ferris' lyrics originally had an additional verse that began the song, starting \\"Now/Got no place to go\\", which was left out of the final version. Hegarty and Halliwell describe the last lines, \\"Fly/High/And then/You make it\\", as lacking in narrative link to the rest of the album, but ending on a \\"melancholic high\\". The song ends with a piano and organ chord, which is followed after 6 seconds of silence by a sample of Forst saying \\"Do it!\\", the final sound of the album. Packaging The album's sleeve was created by production coordinator Gerard Fallec. Ferris stated that Fallec's initial idea was to have a black cover with \\"666\\" printed in white in the middle, inspired by the white background of The Beatles, and created the original design with three plastic car numbers. Ferris and Vangelis liked the idea but preferred a red background with the number printed white on black in the middle, similar to a vehicle registration plate. This became the final design, although several vinyl issues of the album use the original white number on black background sleeve. Fallec also brought to the band a surreal, Dal√≠-influenced painting of a car crash that became the inner sleeve. Ferris stated that the band forgot to ask for the name of the artist (although the signature \\"M. Dubre\\" appears on the image), and that while Fallec was unsure about the relation of the painting to the work apart from the \\"car\\" theme of the cover, he and Vangelis considered it \\"the absolute representation of the stupidity of man.\\" The liner notes state \\"This album was recorded under the influence of Sahlep.\\" Intended as a joke by the band, the statement provoked some controversy at the time of the album's release, as some groups interpreted it to mean that the album was drug-inspired, demonic, or blasphemous. Release and reception Colin Larkin's Encyclopedia of Popular Music states that \\"the album was applauded for its ambition and execution\\", but it did not attract many contemporary reviews.

A variable speed of light occurs in some situations of classical physics as equivalent formulations of accepted theories, but also in various alternative theories of gravitation and cosmology, many of them non-mainstream. Notable attempts to incorporate a variable speed of light into physics have been made by Einstein in 1911, by Robert Dicke in 1957, and by several researchers starting from the late 1980s. The speed of light in vacuum instead is considered a constant, and defined by the SI as 299,792,458 m/s. Variability of the speed of light is therefore equivalent with a variability of the SI meter and/or the SI second. VSL should not be confused with faster than light theories; nor should it be confused with the fact that the speed of light in a medium is slower than the speed of light in vacuum depending on the medium's refractive index. Historical proposals =Einstein's early proposal (1911)= While Einstein first mentioned a variable speed of light in 1907, he reconsidered the idea more thoroughly in 1911. In analogy to the situation in a medium, where a shorter wavelength \\\\lambda , by means of c = u \\\\lambda , leads to a lower speed of light, Einstein assumed that clocks in a gravitational field run slower, whereby the corresponding frequencies u are influenced by the gravitational potential (eq.2, p. 903): : u_1 = u_2 \\\\left(1+\\\\frac{GM}{r c^2}\\\\right). Einstein commented (pages 906‚Äì907): In a subsequent paper in 1912, he concluded that: However, Einstein deduced a light deflection at the Sun of \\"almost one arcsecond\\" which is just one-half of the measured value later derived by his theory of general relativity. The measured value was provided by Eddington in 1919. =Einstein's updated proposals (1905‚Äì1915)= Albert Einstein went through several versions of light speed theory between 1905 and 1915, eventually concluding that light speed is constant when gravity does not have to be considered but that the speed of light cannot be constant in a gravitational field with variable strength. In the same book Einstein explained that he intended light speed to be a vector when it was described by coordinates in a reference frame. Einstein was not explicit about whether the speed of light would change in a gravity field, or whether just the direction of the vector would change; this can be clarified from the text implicitly, however. A calculation of alpha (Œ±) follows equation 107 and makes an unambiguous use of variable scalar light velocity (L) both as the argument of a partial differential function (proving a variable) and as the denominator in a fraction (proving not a vector) both in the same integrated quantity. Division of a scalar by a vector is not defined, so there is no other way to interpret the velocity of light in this usage except as a variable scalar speed. In this calculation L = c/c0 where c0 is light speed in flat space. : \\\\alpha = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{+\\\\infty} \\\\frac{1}{L}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial x_1}\\\\right) dx_3 Peter Bergmann did not agree with Einstein, but left the dispute out of his earlier book in 1942 to get Einstein's endorsement. After Einstein died Bergmann wrote a new book in 1968 claiming that vector light velocity could change direction but not speed. This has become a prevailing opinion in science, but not in agreement with Einstein's unambiguous math. Bergman did acknowledge that the apparent speed of light would change in a gravity field and go to zero at an event horizon as viewed by a distant observer. Max Born agreed with Einstein and stated both speed and direction of light change in a gravity field first published 1923 in English, 1920 in German. Born expressed the magnitude of light speed as the square root of (‚àíg44/g11) gravity components in general relativity to leave no doubt about his intent. Richard Tolman also agreed with Einstein and expressed the radial speed of light as dr/dt in a gravity field. : \\\\frac{dr}{dt} = 1 - \\\\frac{2m}{r}, where m is MG/c2 and where natural units are used such that c0 is equal to one. =Dicke's proposal (1957)= Robert Dicke, in 1957, developed a related VSL theory of gravity. In contrast to Einstein, Dicke assumed not only the frequencies to vary, but also the wavelengths. Since c = u \\\\lambda , this resulted in a relative change of c twice as much as considered by Einstein. Dicke assumed a refractive index n= \\\\frac{c}{c_0} = 1+\\\\frac{2 GM}{r c^2} (eqn.5) and proved it to be consistent with the observed value for light deflection. In a comment related to Mach's principle, Dicke suggested that, while the right part of the term in eq. 5 is small, the left part, 1, could have \\"its origin in the remainder of the matter in the universe\\". Given that in a universe with an increasing horizon more and more masses contribute to the above refractive index, Dicke considered a cosmology where c decreased in time, providing an alternative explanation to the cosmological redshift (p. 374). Dicke's theory is compatible with the SI definition of c since the time and length units second and meter can vary in concert, keeping the value of c fixed (p. 366). =Subsequent proposals= Spatial variation of the speed of light is implicitly present in general relativity, occurring in the coordinate space description.: \\"note that the photon speed is ... u = 1+2 \\\\phi +O(v^3).\\" ( \\\\phi denoting the gravitational potential ‚àíGM/r) Based on this observation, variable speed of light models, including Dicke's, have been developed which agree with all known tests of general relativity, but some are distinct for higher-order tests. Other models claim to shed light on the equivalence principle or make a link to Dirac's large numbers hypothesis. Several hypotheses for varying speed of light, seemingly in contradiction to general relativity theory, have been published, including those of Giere and Tan (1986) and Sanejouand (2005). In 2003 Magueijo gave a review of such hypotheses. arXiv preprint Modern VSL theories as an alternative to cosmic inflation  The varying speed of light cosmology has been proposed independently by Jean-Pierre Petit in 1988, John Moffat in 1992, and the team of Andreas Albrecht and Jo√£o Magueijo in 1998 to explain the horizon problem of cosmology and propose an alternative to cosmic inflation. Secular variation of the constants of Physics.[34] In Petit's VSL model, the variation of c accompanies the joint variations of all physical constants combined to space and time scale factors changes, so that all equations and measurements of these constants remain unchanged through the evolution of the universe. This provides a universal gauge relationship and the secular variation of the parameters usually taken to be constants: G=G_0 \\\\sqrt[3]{1+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\tau^2}}\\\\quad m=\\\\frac{m_0}{\\\\sqrt[3]{1+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\tau^2}}}\\\\quad c=c_0 \\\\sqrt[6]{1+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\tau^2}} h=\\\\frac{h_0}{\\\\sqrt{1+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\tau^2}}}\\\\quad e=\\\\frac{e_0}{\\\\sqrt[6]{1+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\tau^2}}}\\\\quad \\\\mu=\\\\frac{\\\\mu_0}{\\\\sqrt[3]{1+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\tau^2}}} see figure \\"secular variation of constant\\". The Einstein field equations remain invariant through convenient joint variations of c and G in the Einstein gravitational constant. According to this model, the cosmological horizon grows like R, the space scale, which ensures the homogeneity of the primeval universe, which fits the observational data. Subsequent developments of the model restricts the variation of constants to the higher energy density of the early universe, at the very beginning of the radiation-dominated era where spacetime is identified to space-entropy with a metric conformally flat. Moffat and the team Albrecht‚ÄìMagueijo present the idea that the speed of light had a very large value of about 1035 km/s in the early universe, thus their models show distant regions of the expanding universe interacting at the beginning of the universe. There is no known way to solve the horizon problem with a variation of the fine-structure constant, because its variation does not change the causal structure of spacetime. To do so would require modifying gravity by varying Newton's constant or redefining special relativity. Classically, varying speed of light cosmologies propose to circumvent this by varying the dimensionful quantity c by breaking the Lorentz invariance of Einstein's theories of general and special relativity in a particular way. Magueijo has also proposed a formulation that preserves local Lorentz invariance. C. K√∂hn actually took over the idea by Albrecht and Magueijo and investigated the motion of a relativistic particle in two time dimensions . He showed that the speed of light depends on time as c\\\\sim 1/t . However, this time dependency is negligible for the current state/size of the Universe which is the reason why the speed of light appears to be constant at present times. However, two time dimensions explain why the speed of light was not constant in the Early Universe as proposed by Albrecht and Magueijo. Various other VSL occurrences  =Virtual photons= Virtual photons in some calculations in quantum field theory may also travel at a different speed for short distances; however, this doesn't imply that anything can travel faster than light. While it has been claimed (see VSL criticism below) that no meaning can be ascribed to a dimensional quantity such as the speed of light varying in time (as opposed to a dimensionless number such as the fine structure constant), in some controversial theories in cosmology, the speed of light also varies by changing the postulates of special relativity. =Varying photon speed= The photon, the particle of light which mediates the electromagnetic force is believed to be massless. The so-called Proca action describes a theory of a massive photon. Classically, it is possible to have a photon which is extremely light but nonetheless has a tiny mass, like the neutrino. These photons would propagate at less than the speed of light defined by special relativity and have three directions of polarization. However, in quantum field theory, the photon mass is not consistent with gauge invariance or renormalizability and so is usually ignored. However, a quantum theory of the massive photon can be considered in the Wilsonian effective field theory approach to quantum field theory, where, depending on whether the photon mass is generated by a Higgs mechanism or is inserted in an ad hoc way in the Proca Lagrangian, the limits implied by various observations/experiments may be different. So, therefore, the speed of light is not constant. =Varying c in quantum theory= In quantum field theory the Heisenberg uncertainty relations indicate that photons can travel at any speed for short periods. In the Feynman diagram interpretation of the theory, these are known as \\"virtual photons\\", and are distinguished by propagating off the mass shell. These photons may have any velocity, including velocities greater than the speed of light. To quote Richard Feynman \\"...there is also an amplitude for light to go faster (or slower) than the conventional speed of light. You found out in the last lecture that light doesn't go only in straight lines; now, you find out that it doesn't go only at the speed of light! It may surprise you that there is an amplitude for a photon to go at speeds faster or slower than the conventional speed, c.\\" These virtual photons, however, do not violate causality or special relativity, as they are not directly observable and information cannot be transmitted acausally in the theory. Feynman diagrams and virtual photons are usually interpreted not as a physical picture of what is taking place, but rather as a convenient calculation tool (which, in some cases, happen to involve faster-than-light velocity vectors). Relation to other constants and their variation = Gravitational constant G= In 1937, Paul Dirac and others began investigating the consequences of natural constants changing with time. For example, Dirac proposed a change of only 5 parts in 1011 per year of Newton's constant G to explain the relative weakness of the gravitational force compared to other fundamental forces. This has become known as the Dirac large numbers hypothesis. However, Richard Feynman showed that the gravitational constant most likely could not have changed this much in the past 4 billion years based on geological and solar system observations (although this may depend on assumptions about the constant not changing other constants). (See also strong equivalence principle.) =Fine structure constant Œ± = One group, studying distant quasars, has claimed to detect a variation of the fine structure constant at the level in one part in 105. Other authors dispute these results. Other groups studying quasars claim no detectable variation at much higher sensitivities. For over three decades since the discovery of the Oklo natural nuclear fission reactor in 1972, even more stringent constraints, placed by the study of certain isotopic abundances determined to be the products of a (estimated) 2 billion year-old fission reaction, seemed to indicate no variation was present. However, Lamoreaux and Torgerson of the Los Alamos National Laboratory conducted a new analysis of the data from Oklo in 2004, and concluded that Œ± has changed in the past 2 billion years by 4.5 parts in . They claimed that this finding was \\"probably accurate to within 20%.\\" Accuracy is dependent on estimates of impurities and temperature in the natural reactor. These conclusions have yet to be verified by other researchers. Paul Davies and collaborators have suggested that it is in principle possible to disentangle which of the dimensionful constants (the elementary charge, Planck's constant, and the speed of light) of which the fine-structure constant is composed is responsible for the variation. However, this has been disputed by others and is not generally accepted.  Criticisms of various VSL concepts  = Dimensionless and dimensionful quantities = It has to be clarified what a variation in a dimensionful quantity actually means, since any such quantity can be changed merely by changing one's choice of units. John Barrow wrote: :\\"[An] important lesson we learn from the way that pure numbers like Œ± define the world is what it really means for worlds to be different. The pure number we call the fine structure constant and denote by Œ± is a combination of the electron charge, e, the speed of light, c, and Planck's constant, h. At first we might be tempted to think that a world in which the speed of light was slower would be a different world. But this would be a mistake. If c, h, and e were all changed so that the values they have in metric (or any other) units were different when we looked them up in our tables of physical constants, but the value of Œ± remained the same, this new world would be observationally indistinguishable from our world. The only thing that counts in the definition of worlds are the values of the dimensionless constants of Nature. If all masses were doubled in value [including the Planck mass mP] you cannot tell because all the pure numbers defined by the ratios of any pair of masses are unchanged.\\"John D. Barrow, The Constants of Nature; From Alpha to Omega - The Numbers that Encode the Deepest Secrets of the Universe, Pantheon Books, New York, 2002, . Any equation of physical law can be expressed in a form in which all dimensional quantities are normalized against like-dimensioned quantities (called nondimensionalization), resulting in only dimensionless quantities remaining. In fact, physicists can choose their units so that the physical constants c, G, ƒß = h/(2œÄ), 4œÄŒµ0, and kB take the value one, resulting in every physical quantity being normalized against its corresponding Planck unit. For that, it has been claimed that specifying the evolution of a dimensional quantity is meaningless and does not make sense. When Planck units are used and such equations of physical law are expressed in this nondimensionalized form, no dimensional physical constants such as c, G, ƒß, Œµ0, nor kB remain, only dimensionless quantities. Short of their anthropometric unit dependence, there simply is no speed of light, gravitational constant, nor Planck's constant, remaining in mathematical expressions of physical reality to be subject to such hypothetical variation. For example, in the case of a hypothetically varying gravitational constant, G, the relevant dimensionless quantities that potentially vary ultimately become the ratios of the Planck mass to the masses of the fundamental particles. Some key dimensionless quantities (thought to be constant) that are related to the speed of light (among other dimensional quantities such as ƒß, e, Œµ0), notably the fine-structure constant or the proton-to-electron mass ratio, does have meaningful variance and their possible variation continues to be studied.ibid = Relation to relativity and definition of c = Specifically regarding VSL, if the SI meter definition was reverted to its pre-1960 definition as a length on a prototype bar (making it possible for the measure of c to change), then a conceivable change in c (the reciprocal of the amount of time taken for light to travel this prototype length) could be more fundamentally interpreted as a change in the dimensionless ratio of the meter prototype to the Planck length or as the dimensionless ratio of the SI second to the Planck time or a change in both. If the number of atoms making up the meter prototype remains unchanged (as it should for a stable prototype), then a perceived change in the value of c would be the consequence of the more fundamental change in the dimensionless ratio of the Planck length to the sizes of atoms or to the Bohr radius or, alternatively, as the dimensionless ratio of the Planck time to the period of a particular caesium-133 radiation or both. = General critique of varying c cosmologies= From a very general point of view, G. Ellis expressed concerns that a varying c would require a rewrite of much of modern physics to replace the current system which depends on a constant c. Ellis claimed that any varying c theory (1) must redefine distance measurements (2) must provide an alternative expression for the metric tensor in general relativity (3) might contradict Lorentz invariance (4) must modify Maxwell's equations (5) must be done consistently with respect to all other physical theories. Whether these concerns apply to the proposals of Einstein (1911) and Dicke (1957) is a matter of debate, though VSL cosmologies remain out of mainstream physics.

In the social sciences, the word \\"clique\\" is used to describe a group of 2 to 12 (averaging 5 or 6) \\"who interact with each other more regularly and intensely than others in the same setting\\". Cliques are distinguished from \\"crowds\\" in that their members interact with one another (e.g. hang out together, go shopping, play sports). Crowds, on the other hand, are defined by reputation. Although the word 'clique' or 'cliquey' is often used in day-to-day conversation to describe relational aggression or snarky, gossipy behaviors of groups of socially dominant teenage girls, that is not always accurate. Interacting with cliques is part of normative social development regardless of gender, ethnicity, or popularity. Although cliques are most commonly studied during adolescence , they exist in all age groups. Definition As children enter adolescence, cultural, biological and cognitive changes cause variation in their daily lives. Adolescents spend far less time with their parents and begin participating in both structured and unstructured peer activities. Without the direct presence of their parents or other adults, their peer network begins to become the primary context for most socialization and activity. These social \\"cliques\\" fundamentally influence adolescent life and development. Perhaps because they are perceived as an external threat to parental authority, undesired changes in adolescent behavior are often attributed to cliques. In these situations, cliques are described as \\"social grouping[s] of persons that exhibit a great deal of peer pressure on its members and is exclusive, based on superficial differences\\". Researchers, however, question these assumptions: based on empiric data from both experiments and ethnographies they suggest that clique structure characterizes many friendship networks within any given school, not all of which negatively affect adolescents. A more neutral and scientific definition of clique is \\"a grouping of persons who interact with each other more regularly and intensely than others in the same setting\\". Although cliques can range from two to twelve people, cliques typically consist of five or six people who are homogeneous in age, gender, race, social status, and socioeconomic background. More subtle determinant of group membership, such as shared interests and values, take precedence as adolescents develop more sophisticated, abstract cognitive functions (more here), which allow them to categorize individuals in more subtle ways and better interpret social interactions. Consistent group identities thus allow individuals to cope with the anonymity and intimidation that often accompany the transition into large secondary schools. Similar cliques may re-emerge in adulthood in specific contexts, characterized by large, undifferentiated, anonymous crowds. Overall, cliques are a transitory social phase. In general, cliques first form in early adolescence with strict gender segregation, but by middle adolescence, some mixed-gender activities within the peer crowds foster close, cross-sex friendships which begin to restructure the clique. During late adolescence, the organized clique structure typically dissolves into associated sets of couples, which then remain the primary social unit into and throughout adulthood. Cliques are different from other types of peer groups often seen in the average school, which are often reputation-based groups such as jocks or nerds. The major difference is that these reputation-based groups do not necessarily interact with each other, whereas members of a clique do interact with one another and have frequent social interactions. For example, football players are considered jocks, but not all members of a football team always interact with each other. Clique membership =Common misconceptions= Although the popular media portrays female cliques almost exclusively (see examples in movies, television, and young adult fiction), clique membership is almost equally prevalent in adolescent boys. Girls do, however, tend to form cliques earlier (11 years old as compared with 13 or 14 among boys), which may contribute to the greater popular salience of female cliques. Additionally, the activities central to most female cliques include gossip and emotional sharing; this behavior visibly increases, revealing female cliques to the outside observer. Male cliques, on the other hand, tend to center around activities that have occurred before the formation of the clique (common examples include sports and other shared activities or interests), and thus may draw less attention to the appearance of male cliques. Male cliques may have also gone largely unnoticed because they often appear less exclusive toward the non-clique peer group members. This last difference may arise because males more frequently reported ambitions related to acceptance and status throughout their crowd, whereas females more often aspired to status and close bonds with only a few peers (i.e. a clique). Males were also more likely to consider actively exclusive behavior unethical, as were younger adolescents. The stereotype of cruel, unwelcoming clique members is well supported in some cases, but other cliques are more open to drifters. Both attitudes appear in some cliques of both sexes and all social groups become more permeable with age. Similarly, although adolescents tend to associate with others of the same ethnicity and socioeconomic status, clique membership is equally common across ethnicity and economic background. The characteristics of the distinct cliques within each demographic group also vary equally, although members of cliques in one crowd or demographic group may not perceive all of the distinctions in others (see also crowds). =Forms of association= A number of recent studies confirm that regardless of gender, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status, adolescents tend to fall into one of three categories: group members, liaisons, and isolates. # Group Member: The majority of group members' social interactions occur within the same small group. They comprise less than half of any given school population at a time, with a higher concentration among girls and younger grades. # Liaisons: Liaisons associate with a few members of multiple cliques and are generally regarded positively by their peers. # Isolates: Characterized by few, if any, close peer relationships, these individuals do not regularly interact with any clique members. Isolated can be further classified by social agency: ## Volunteer status ‚Äì these isolates deliberately avoid forming relationships. ## Forced status ‚Äì peers actively exclude, mock, or victimize these isolates (see relational aggression and bullying). =Stability over time= Membership type is far more stable over time than membership in an individual clique: isolates generally remain socially disengaged, liaisons remain equally consistent, and \\"group members\\" frequently switch from one clique to another, but typically remain group members over time. The objective cliques themselves remain surprisingly stable as well. On average, cliques lose around one third of their members over a given school year, but new members with similar characteristics tend to replace the deserters, maintaining the general identity of the clique. Clique membership becomes more stable across time, as well as more permeable, less exclusive, and less hierarchical. Contrary to popular belief, individual friendships are far less stable across the school year. This is particularly true of high-status cliques and individuals, in which clique members must critically analyse their friendships and socialize only with their most popular peers or risk losing membership and status. Types of American cliques Using the definition of a clique, we are able to draw distinctions between the many different types of cliques a person is able to be a member of. During adolescent years, students may obtain membership to a certain clique in order to ease the process of secondary school. Since adolescents emulating similar cultural standards are likely to become friends and these friends are likely to encourage these aspects of their attitudes, behaviors, and dress, the types of cliques commonly found in schools can vary significantly. Some of the more common types of cliques found include: jocks, tomboys, cheerleaders, mean girls, foreigners, gamers, hipsters, hippies, troublemakers, peacemakers, class clowns, \\"cool kids\\", arty intellectuals, gangsters, wangsters, \\"ghetto kids\\", stoners/slackers, girly girls, scenesters, scene kids, punks, preps, skaters, goths, emos, skinheads, geeks/nerds, and drifters. In American popular culture, the jocks, cheerleaders and other athletes are at the top of the social pyramid. They are normally portrayed as snooty and ruthless and do whatever it takes to keep the status quo. At the very bottom are nerds and geeks, otherwise known as people who work hard and get good grades while in school. These characters normally wear glasses/suspenders, are often pushed into lockers, and suffer from various types of abuse. In the middle are artsy kids, class clowns, goths, loners and other groups that are not portrayed on such an extreme level as the two previously mentioned. =Middle school cliques= Kardashian's sociologists Patricia and Peter Adler claim that middle school cliques can fall under four specific labels: *The Popular Clique ‚Äì members of this clique are generally known to have the most friends in their school, and are viewed as having the most fun. *The Fringe Group ‚Äì members of this clique follow in the shadow of members of the popular clique‚Äîthey mimic the popular cliques' actions, structure and guidelines, but are not actually part of it. They are \\"second in line\\" to the popular kids. *The Loners ‚Äì members of this group seem to have very few friends, and prefer to work and be alone. Some may be envious of those who belong to a different clique. *The Friendship Circles ‚Äì members of friendship circles tend to be groups of friends who share a common belief, interest, style, appearance, or hobby, or are looking for their own culture separate from the other cliques. The friendship circles can be divided into some categories, such as: **The Athletes ‚Äì members of this group play sports in or outside of school. They tend to have many friends and are sometimes with the popular clique. These kids are usually in a regular relationship. **The Nerds/Geeks ‚Äì members of this group are studious, and care a lot about their schoolwork. Some may be socially impaired, however most have friends in the same group. They prefer video games, studying, and reading instead of playing sports or going to large social events. **The Punks/Goths ‚Äì members of punk or goth cliques tend to have small amounts of friends and trouble interacting with others, they can be seen as violent or depressed due to their heavy use of makeup and dark clothing. This clique is less common in middle schools than it may be in high schools. **The Artists ‚Äì members of this group are very interested the arts. Their social activeness varies. For example, thespians may be very social, while people who draw may not be. Artists have many different clothing styles, and like to draw, sing, or perform otherwise. =High school cliques= TLC mentions and describes some typical types of teen cliques observable in most high schools.Kelly, J. (2012, March 8). Some of the more common types of cliques found include: jocks, cheerleaders, mean girls, foreigners, gamers, sluts, hipsters, hippies, arty intellectuals, gangsters, stoners/slackers, scenesters, punks, preps, skaters, goths, emos, skinheads, geeks/nerds, athletic girls, \\"cool kids\\" and drifters. 10 Types of Teens: A Field Guide to Teenagers. TLC Family. Retrieved October 31, 2012 *Geeks ‚Äì a group of students described as being intellectual, obsessive or socially impaired. They usually don't have the modern fashion sense of other groups, and they usually prefer chess to hoops. \\"Geeky\\" interests and hobbies usually include: fantasy movies and shows, role-playing games and technical hobbies and activities (which in some cases can include technology knowledge). Geeks are smart, but they sometimes have a hard time socially, as many teens view them as being more boring to be around than others. *Jocks ‚Äì live for athletics, tend to be popular with many of their peers. They may be the male equivalent of \\"mean girls\\". *Thespians ‚Äì the teens who are obsessed with Broadway musicals and more than likely aspire to do theatre professionally. They typically have a very busy and complicated schedule, spending most of their time in rehearsal for the school show or working on their craft. They generally do well academically and have a good sense of responsibility. Their hobbies include learning all the songs and dances to all their favourite musicals, singing randomly at any given time, and obsessing over a new favourite Broadway show every week. They are usually very kind and sweet to those outside of their own clique, except for the occasional diva. They are also creative and very funny, but have a unique sense of humor which is only funny to those who understand musical theatre references; their preferred subjects are in the performing arts‚Äîdrama, singing, dance, acting, and musical theatre. They may also be involved in other performing arts activities, such as choir or dancing. *Skaters ‚Äì skateboarders who came along and borrowed the long hair and slacker trappings of the surf scene, but they have always been more rebellious. *Outsiders ‚Äì may be socially challenged and unable to fit in, or they may be independent and feel no need to join any one group exclusively. They tend to have an \\"I don't care about anything\\" attitude, and will oftentimes get in trouble for it. *Hipsters ‚Äì make a big effort to assemble a wardrobe that seems effortless. They challenge traditional norms and modern trends. All genders wear tight jeans, flannel shirts, Buddy Holly glasses and vintage clothing. They follow the latest trends in fashion and like to be independent from the other cliques and often do what is \\"uncool\\" before it becomes \\"cool\\". *Greasers ‚Äì A rather uncommon clique but can be spotted in high schools all over the globe. This clique started in the late 40s and was popular up until the mid 60s but there are small cliques you can find who are greasers. Hated by lots of kids and are teased but tease back (Give none take none is a motto by the greasers meaning; don't take crap or create crap). Greasers wear leather jackets, dickies jackets, etc. and jeans cuffed 1-3 inches and grease their hair using pomade or a similar substance. They also can be spotted wearing vintage looking converse and \\"buckle boots\\" otherwise known as engineer boots. *Scenesters ‚Äì Also known as Trendies, they are ever eager to fit in. They are dedicated followers of fashion, devoted to a particular band, club or style. They dress in tight, fashionable clothing, wear sunglasses and sport wild but styled hairdos (striped, streaked or spiked). Social media platforms are totally essential to them. Scenesters sometimes get labeled posers or wannabes. *Preps ‚Äì a subgenre of the popular clique. Preps tend to be good at being social and having fun and usually come from an upper middle class or upper-class family. Sometimes they overlap with jocks, especially when it comes to sports. In most high schools, preps are those most commonly chosen to have important positions for school events such as Class Officers, Extracurricular Activities, Home Coming King/Queen, Prom King/Queen and Prom Court. Maintaining the right image may even make them vulnerable. Unlike the stereotype of \\"mean girls\\", preps often get along with everyone. *Nerds ‚Äì they are obsessed and often have superior knowledge or devotion to something, usually aren't fashion-conscious, may be introverted, and they often do well in school. *Mean girls ‚Äì the 2004 movie Mean Girls, starring Lindsay Lohan as a girl negotiating the jungles of teenage subcultures, put a new label on this type of teen. They always embrace the latest fashions. They form exclusive cliques and frequently engage in gossip. They crave popularity, often because they feel insecure; yet they have a hard time with genuine relationships. *Emo kids ‚Äì highly emotional. Their emotions are reflected in their appearance: dark clothing, streaked bangs, and tattoos and piercings. The emo style has its roots in punk culture, which tended to be more rebellious, and goth, which was darker and gloomier. Some emos are described as scene kids because they wear brighter neon clothes. These kids are more vulnerable to depression or bipolar tendencies. They are known for experiments with self-injury and cutting, though not all of them do this. Emo kids tend to be mistaken for goth due to their dark outfits, or sometimes rockers being they often wear band t-shirts and have a lot of musical interests. *Rockers ‚Äì tend to stay away from the crowd and in small groups with similar interests in music. This is a very large clique because of how diverse it is. They tend to wear band T-shirts, lots of jewelry, and baggy or tight jeans and are usually listening to music. Many of them will be in a band or know an instrument. They live according to the Rock and Roll lifestyle: Sex, drugs, and music. *Drifters ‚Äì individuals that are capable of simultaneous interactions with one or more groups non-exclusively, or being independent at their own accord. They don't demand attention, often opting to blend in the background to avoid potential conflict or being labeled as part of a group. However, some usually don't mind being in the know with most gossips or rumors or learning things that no one else is aware of. All- Rounders play the neutral role most of the time. In some cases they act as a liaison between two different groups. As such, they are considered to be \\"well-known\\" rather than being \\"popular\\". Within clique structure =Popularity= A powerful, yet unstable social hierarchy structures interactions between group members in any given clique. This hierarchy is always topped by the highest-status member, labeled by psychologists as the \\"Leader\\" or \\"Queen Bee\\". In her now famous ethnography of adolescent cliques, Queen Bees and Wannabes, author Rosalind Wiseman explains the standard set of roles most frequently adopted by male and female clique members. Females: * Queen Bee ‚Äì Leader: rules by \\"charisma, force, money, looks, will, & manipulation\\". * Sidekick ‚Äì Lieutenant: invariably supports the Queen Bee's opinions. * Banker ‚Äì Gossip: collects and employs information for her own gain until part of clique, then works for benefit of Queen Bee and Sidekick. * Floater ‚Äì Similar to a Liaison; closely associated with multiple cliques. * Pleaser ‚Äì Can be in or out of clique: immediately adopts all of the Queen Bee and Sidekick's opinions, yet never gains their approval and is often treated with indifference by the Queen Bee. * Target ‚Äì Outside of the clique; regularly excluded and humiliated. Males: * Leader ‚Äì Like the Queen Bee: Athletic, tough, rich, & gets the girls. * Flunkie ‚Äì Like the Pleaser, he does anything asked of him, but he also responds to any member. Inadvertently annoys others with his actions regularly.\\\\ * Adviser ‚Äì Advises the leader on decisions, often the smartest one. * Thug ‚Äì Although often smarter than he lets on, the Thug communicates primarily through nonverbal bullying. He typically appears popular, but may have had a rough past or childhood. * The Get Wits ‚Äì Groupies of male clique: respected by adults as high-achieving \\"good kids\\", but only unsought tag-a-longs to the clique. Although too rigid to be entirely accurate across samples, these basic denominations are useful for discussing general behavior and organization within cliques. The role hierarchies within cliques are significantly more stable than the individual members. Maintaining one's status and power requires constant effort. Queen Bees and Leaders must work the hardest to protect their positions and typically become manipulative and disliked in the process. For example, a Leader or Queen Bee may keep objective attention off of him or herself by unpredictably alternating praise and criticism of other members (see relational aggression). They may also change the way the clique views activities, values, and opinions of things to keep the other members unsure of where they stand in the group.\\" The Leader or Queen Bee also maintains power over group membership‚Äîexercised through both tacit and explicit rejection of prospective members‚Äîas well as the final say in accepting new members, regardless of the opinions of other members. The majority of new memberships results from one of two approaches: invitation or application. The \\"invitation\\" approach originates within the clique: a current member of a clique invites a potential member either explicitly or by indirect socialization, which consists of the clique attempting to demonstrate the joys and benefits of membership. Aspiring peers who have not been invited can also \\"apply\\" by courting the lowest ranking members and progressing up to the Leader or Queen Bee who will decide whether to accept him or her. =Elements of popularity= Advanced and adaptable social skills are the best predictors of popularity, but further predictors of popularity are difficult to identify, primarily because the schema of \\"popularity\\" represents the interaction between two distinct concepts. Popularity breaks down into sociometric status (sometimes called \\"likability\\"), which measures peers' private feelings toward the individual, and perceived popularity, which reflects the individual's status, prestige, and power. Socio-metric status is determined by fairly universally valuable characteristics including social skills, friendliness, and sense of humor. The foundations of perceived popularity, on the other hand, vary widely. Some popular adolescents are high in both characteristics, but they more often develop in distinct individuals and cliques, all considered \\"popular\\" during adolescence. Regardless of popularity type, highly popular individuals influence local norms and behaviors in similar ways: \\"adolescents are easily swayed by the opinions of high-status peers to endorse activities they might otherwise reject and to run the other way from activities endorsed by low-status peers, even if they secretly enjoy them\\". The popular individuals themselves, however, fare differently depending on the root of their status. Several recent studies proved the discriminant validity of the two groups and found that perceived popularity in high school is predictive of alcohol use, sexual activity, and smoking. It may also be associated with a lasting drop in sociometric status. Several recent studies suggest that long-term outcomes are generally more positive for individuals who were neither Isolates nor among the most popular during adolescence. Between clique structure =Personal factors= A status hierarchy much like that within individual cliques organizes the various cliques within each peer crowd. The crowds within a given school are also perceived hierarchically. Crowd ranking can sometimes change but is generally quite stable across time and schools. Part of a clique's popularity status is based on the crowd with which its members associate, thus similarly-popular cliques within the same crowd are more likely to move within the hierarchy than are similar crowds within the larger peer context. Both because students meet and seek friends with others who share their interests (\\"selection\\") and because much of clique members time, both free and structured, takes place in the company of the other members (\\"socialization\\"), cliques are usually defined by common attitudes and activities. Among the most powerful determinants of clique membership are orientation toward school, orientation toward teen culture, and involvement in antisocial behavior. Orientation toward school Because studying time and partying time conflict, most individuals are rarely exposed to individuals from the opposite end of this spectrum during unstructured time. Membership in the same clique with peers whose values are highly distinct is thus uncommon. Individuals with only somewhat different views of school, however, are likely to belong to the same clique, and socialization is likely to decrease their differences over time. For example, girls' decisions about enrollment in advanced math are significantly related to those of their close friends. A study of 78 high schools found that even controlling for past achievement, the GPAs of an individual's close friends reliably help predict grades; in fact \\"of all the characteristics of friends that influence adolescents' behavior, their friends' school performance has the greatest impact, not only on their own academic achievement, but also on their involvement in problem behavior and drug use.\\" Orientation toward teen culture Similar taste in music and clothing signal others with potentially shared interests and values and often suggest the leisure activities and substance use patterns of which they approve. Thus adolescents emulating similar cultural standards are likely to become friends and these friends are likely to encourage these aspects of their attitudes, behaviors, and dress. Participation in subcultures can also reinforce belonging. In many cases, clique members can be easily identified based on dress alone. Antisocial activity Research does not support the common belief that troubled adolescents have few or no friends. Instead such individuals gravitate toward one another and form their own cliques, although these friendships do often differ from the friendships of more socially acceptable children. This general self-sorting trend applies in different ways to specific kinds of antisocial behavior. A few of the most studied are substance use, aggression, and depressive symptoms. * Substance use Similarity in substance use is one of the most powerful factors in clique development and lasting membership, even serving as the earliest predictor of cross-gender friendships and the most common basis for multi-ethnic cliques. Alcohol and drug use are predicted by the interaction between number of substance using friends, the extent of their substance use, and perceived closeness to those friends; a substance-free adolescent is thus unlikely to seek out or be accepted by a clique characterized by frequent substance use and even more unlikely to remain substance-free long after entering such clique Cliques typically fall into one of four categories and clique membership reliably predicts individual behavior. ** High Functioning cliques consisted of \\"a network of high-achieving friends who were involved in school-based extracurricular activities and who reported low use of alcohol and few symptoms of depression.\\" ** Maladjusted cliques \\"showed the opposite pattern\\": uninvolved in school performance and organized activities, used alcohol frequently and to excess, and reported multiple symptoms of depression. ** Disengaged cliques did not encourage engagement \\"in much of anything, including drinking.\\" ** Engaged cliques consisted of friends who \\"engaged in school, achieved decent grades, and neither abstained from nor abused alcohol.\\" Members of High Functioning and Engaged cliques demonstrated the best long-term outcomes, whereas Maladjusted clique membership predicted low achievement, chronic substance abuse, and confrontation with authorities and Disengaged clique members and others who abstained completely typically exhibited abnormally high anxiety and inhibition. * Aggression Gravitation toward similar peer groups can be especially dangerous for adolescents with aggressive tendencies. A recent observational study on antisocial, aggressive boys established that clique members tended to live in the same neighborhood, where they met and bonded through unstructured, unsupervised activities. Since antisocial groups encourage antisocial behavior, aggressive behaviors tend to escalate rapidly within groups of aggressive adolescents. In the case of bullies this effect is so detrimental that those without any friends are actually more likely to improve over time than those with friends and generally experience better long-term outcomes. In the most extreme cases, these groups may become gangs or practice less organized, but equally dangerous, violent delinquency * Depression Although these maladjusted, detrimental cliques can develop among adolescents of either gender, those based on aggression and delinquency are more often observed in males. In females, adjustment problems are more often manifested as internalizing problems, rather than the externalizing problems common among their male peers. Research shows, however, that both internalizing and externalizing behaviors are negatively related to the subjective sense of strong, reliable group belonging, even controlling for adolescent age, gender, ethnicity, family structure, and parents' educational level. Because adolescent females, on average, both report stronger feelings of group belonging and place greater importance on this feeling than do their male peers, girls who do not feel accepted may be more susceptible than equally excluded boys to forming and conforming to cliques based on shared maladaptive behavior. If so, differences in internalizing or externalizing behaviors of adolescent boys and girls may be magnified during adolescence, contributing to the significant gender differences observed in adult outcomes such as incarceration and mood disorders. For example, the same cycle of selection and socialization known to exacerbate aggression applies to the internalizing behaviors associated with depression. One study on the emergence of depression in adolescence found that even controlling for the effects of age and pubertal development, gender predicted several small but significant differences: (a) depressive symptoms and negative peer relations predicted increasing levels of reassurance-seeking in female subjects; (b) initial levels of reassurance-seeking predicted deteriorating friendship quality among girls and initial levels of depressive symptoms, which were higher among girls, predicted low friendship stability among all subjects, and (c) \\"reassurance-seeking combined with poor peer experiences predicted increases in girls' depressive symptoms.\\" Perhaps related to the role of reassurance-seeking, those who both value and experience social acceptance are far less likely to exhibit problem behavior than those who value group membership equally, but are uncertain of their relationship. This relationships is better predicted by self-esteem than the actual quality of the relationships, although also directly related to discordance in personal and peer ratings of status. This effect likely arises cyclically: troubled children are rejected by their peers for their undesirable behavior, while rejected children receive less normative socialization and behave more problematically. =Demographic factors= Although there are exceptions, demographic factors typically influence adolescent crowd membership even before real cliques begin to form and often influence clique membership more powerfully than personal or behavioral characteristics. Many of the effects on clique composition described below may be largely attributed to crowd segregation. Age Because the contemporary school system divides children by age and structures the majority of most adolescents' time and social exposure, age is the most universal common factor among clique members; notable exceptions include friendships formed in neighborhoods or on the internet and those initiated with early- maturing pubertal girls, all of which are often detrimental to the younger friend. Gender Gender is perhaps the strongest determinant of clique composition in very early puberty. During childhood and early adolescence social segregation between is almost absolute. However, unlike other factors, gender division is temporary. Socioeconomic status Another, less advantageous, powerful determinant of clique formation is socioeconomic class. This trend was first published in the famous \\"Elmtown's Youth Study\\", which found that \\"almost never did adolescents from one social class associate with students from a class that was two ranks higher or lower\\". A diverse array of follow-up studies have confirmed that class-consciousness steadily increases throughout adolescence, so that by mid-adolescence clique membership across significantly different social backgrounds is highly anomalous. Ethnicity  In the United States race remains an even stronger determinant of friendship than socioeconomic status. Like socioeconomic status, ethnicity is not a strong determinant of childhood friendships, but becomes increasingly potent with age. By high school, ethnically mixed cliques are rarely observed. This pattern of social segregation is strongest between black students and all other students and most prevalent in schools where students are divided into academic tracks. This is because various factors disadvantage black children, affecting performance in some cases and adult decisions in others so that in many cases black children are disproportionately likely to be placed in lower tracks, regardless of intelligence or performance resulting in uneven distribution between tracks in the majority of American high schools. Researchers suggest that because close friends in adolescence \\"usually have similar attitudes toward school, similar educational aspirations, and similar school achievement levels\\", early tracking may both decrease exposure to peers of other racial and socioeconomic backgrounds and decrease perceived similarity with the majority of those peers Racial divisions are most acute in tracked schools but are fundamental to crowd and clique composition in almost all American schools, and thus cannot be attributed to, nor changed by, any one educational program. More encouragingly, however, longitudinal observations suggest that interventions in early childhood may have the potential to influence social segregation: the more schools foster close cross-racial friendships in childhood the less peer group segregation manifests. Religion A well-established factor in clique composition is religious background, affiliation, and participation. This is somewhat confounded by overlap with socioeconomic status, but also relates to behavioral correlates of religion and selection by both individual and their peers. =Reputation determinants and effects= Cliques reputation is often determined by their most noticeable behavioral characteristic that is shared among their members. The characteristic might be so salient that it could dominate the way that members of that clique are perceived and treated by other peers regardless of the individual differences that each member has. For example, a clique group could be perceived as athletic, but say an individual in that group is very smart and gets good grades in school. That individual would be treated based on his athletic characteristics rather than his intellectual abilities. When people are treated based on a single characteristic it changes their self-image, resulting in a change in who they are. This phenomenon is known as the looking glass self; individuals become more like the way they think they are perceived by others. So for the example where the individual was treated based on his athletic abilities rather than his intelligence, that person will likely focus his attention more on sports rather than doing well in school, causing him or her to become even more like the clique he or she is a part of. This phenomenon where individuals in a group tend to be more like each other than non-group members is known as group homophily. Children almost always choose to be friends of people who share similarities with themselves, hence why similar characteristics among clique members establish the clique's reputation and allow different cliques to be told apart. Clique membership and social adjustment in children's same- gender cliques Most people agree that children are affected by who they associate with, but what is not well understood is the specific characteristics that children of similar types of groups share. The focus of these authors' researchKwon, Kyongboon; Lease, A. Michele (2007). Clique membership and social adjustment in children's same-gender cliques. Merrill- Palmer Quarterly, 53.2, 216-242 was to discover the different emotional and social effects that members of the same cliques share. For their study they divided the 473 fourth and fifth graders into five groups, which were: competent, tough, average, withdrawn, and incompetent/aggressive. The researchers did this by having students rate their classmates on several characteristics; bright, fun, bully, withdrawn, athletic, prosocial, reactive aggression. They then measured differences among groups by asking children questions regarding peers social status and behavioral characteristics. For example, they asked participants to nominate up to three participating classmates who \\"tries to get what he or she wants by hitting, shoving, pushing or threatening others\\". In addition, they asked children questions about themselves that regarded to levels of loneliness and children's social dissatisfaction. The researcher's discovered differences in emotional well- being and social satisfaction between different types of clique groups. They found that competent and average groups showed positive characteristics such as good interpersonal skills, whereas withdrawn, incompetent/aggressive and tough cliques lacked emotional well-being and social satisfaction. Another discovery was that social status levels did not distinguish average, competent and tough cliques from one another. Therefore, if an individual is in one of these three groups they are no more likely to have a high social status than a low social status. Their conclusion to these findings was that even when taking into account individuals social status level, the type of clique people are in has a significant effect on their social and emotional characteristics. Change and stability in childhood A recent study done by Witvliet, Van Lier, Cuijpers and Koot shows the differences in behavioral characteristics between clique members and non-clique members in early elementary school, the stability of clique membership and whether the differences in these characteristics are gender oriented. Three hundred first-grade students (151 boys, 149 girls) from eleven different elementary schools in the Netherlands participated. The children were examined by being asked to determine their best friends. This friendship was considered valid if the elected friendship was reciprocated by the other child. The child was considered to be in a clique when the following criteria was overcome 1) consisted of at least three children 2) each child had to have more connections with members than non- members and 3) a link had to occur between all members of clique. Children were then rated by their peers to determine who was liked the most versus who was liked the least. The children were also asked to determine behavioural characteristics of participants and who best fit the description of characteristics such as aggressive, anxious, etc. The peer study was followed through every spring and children were given a small reward for their involvement. These results were then used to compare between clique members and non-clique members. These results were also used to discuss the children's characteristics while also separating based on gender. In first grade, 29 cliques were found with an average of 5.3 members. In second grade 25 cliques were found with an average of 6.2 members. This study suggests that clique members tend to be more adjusted and that gender may have some form of influence on the results. This study showed that isolated girls would have more behavioural problems than isolated boys.Cuijpers, Koot, van Lier, Witvliet. Change and Stability in Childhood Clique Membership, Isolation From Cliques, and Associated Child Characteristics. Journal of Clinical Child & Adolescent Psychology. Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. n.d. Effect of cliques on the development of psychopathology in children Researches have often conducted studies to determine whether membership to a clique produces positive or negative development. In one 4-year study of 451 children from age nine to twelve, Miranda Witvliet along with Pol A. C. van Lier, Mara Brendgen, Hans M. Koot, and Frank Vitaro examined longitudinal associations between clique membership status and internalizing and externalizing problems during late childhood. In this quasi-experiment the researchers aimed to discover if clique membership status was linked to increases in children's psychopathology. Children from five different elementary schools in northwestern Quebec, Canada were the participants of this particular study. In the study, clique membership status was identified through social network analysis, and peer nominations were used to assess internalizing and externalizing problems. The study used the program Kliquefinder to identify clique membership status through social network analysis. Through use of behavioural descriptions on the Pupil Evaluation Inventory (PEI), peer nominations of externalizing and internalizing behaviors were obtained. Through this study, Witvliet, van Lier, Brendgen, Koot, and Vitaro noted that externalizing problems increased among clique members. They found that clique members compared with isolated children showed, on average, an increase in externalizing problems across that same period. While no sex differences were found in the link between clique membership status and internalizing problems, the association found between clique membership and an increase in externalizing problems was specific to boys only. The researchers claimed that these results support the hypothesis that clique membership protects children against developing internalizing problems. Decline of cliques During middle adolescence, the social norms that once enforced sex cleavage shift to encourage mixed-sex socialization. Single-sex cliques begin to seek out the company of opposite-sex cliques, although at first almost all direct interaction remains within the individual cliques despite the presence of the other clique(s). Gradually, intersex relationships and mixed sex cliques develop, closely followed by the first romantic relationships, which typically appear among early-pubertal, high-status, more physically developed adolescents. Over the course of late adolescence romantic relationships replace clique hierarchies as the most potent determinants of social status and networks of dating couples eventually replace more rigidly structured cliques. The chronological relationship between changing gender dynamics and the dissolution of organized, hierarchical cliques is well-established, but not fully understood. One theory asserts that sex cleavage both arises and wanes because cliques are largely sorted by common interests: girls and boys are generally interested in different activities until dating emerges, after which they share a highly valued activity.(164) This idea is consistent with the direct relationship between pubertal development and the appearance of other-sex friends. One possible explanation for this progression argues that children are socialized from childhood to conform to gender roles and during early adolescence cognitive developments promote active self-presentation and anxiety over peer-perceptions; as a result, early adolescents become more consciously aware of both the benefits of conventional gender identity and the threat of ridicule or rejection in response to unorthodox behavior. According to this framework, gender segregation subsides because the same inculcated gender roles that prompt children to distance themselves from anything associated with the opposite sex also encourage adolescents and adults to demonstrate heterosexual desire and sexual/seductive competence. This argument explains the drastic shift in the targets of ridicule from those who were too androgynous in middle school to those who can not or do not attract sexual attention in high school. The effects of such social enforcement of gender- roles, may take the form of relational aggression, bullying, and gay bullying. Implications Perhaps the most consequential finding from the empirical study of adolescent cliques is that they are not an inherently negative force, but rather part of normative development in our society. Although it is certainly true that certain cliques can negatively influence development, others can actually benefit adolescents. In cases in which clique influence is negative, it is encouraging to note that while most forms of interventions are fairly ineffective and peer group interventions frequently produce iatrogenic effects, interventions with parents have yielded encouraging results.

Each version of Oriental Adventures provides rules for adapting its respective version of D&D; for use in campaign settings based on the Far East, rather than the medieval Europe-setting assumed by most D&D; books. Both versions of Oriental Adventures include example campaign settings. Advanced Dungeons & Dragons The original Oriental Adventures () was written by Gary Gygax, David \\"Zeb\\" Cook, and Fran√ßois Marcela-Froideval, and published in 1985 by TSR, Inc. as a 144-page hardcover for use with the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D;) 1st edition rules. The book was edited by Steve Winter, Mike Breault, Anne Gray, and Thad Russell. The book's cover art was by Jeff Easley, with interior illustrations by Roger Raupp, James Holloway, Easley, and Dave Sutherland. =Campaign features= The book provides rules for ten character classes and three races to be used in place of standard AD&D; classes and races. The book presents new versions of the barbarian (here a steppe warrior or forest and jungle dweller) and monk, as well as new classes such as the ninja, kensai, wu-jen, and shukenja. Kensai \\"seek to perfect their weapons technique to the exclusion of all else. They are deadly in combat, but cannot use magical weaponry because it detracts from the appreciation of their skill\\". Wu-jen are magic-users who must obey their personal taboos to avoid losing all spell powers. Shukenja are clerics who become penalized if they kill enemies too freely. A ninja character must take one of the other classes as well as the ninja class. In keeping with their secret nature, ninja use their normal class as a cover identity; a ninja must be careful to keep his identity secret, as loss of honor (and sudden death) may occur if the PC is unmasked. The other classes introduced in the book are the sohei, the bushi (peasant warriors), the samurai, and the yakuza. The three new character races are the korobokuru (equivalent to dwarves, without the bad temper and greediness), the hengeyokai (intelligent animals who can shape-change into human form), and the spirit folk (humanoids whose life force is tied to a particular location). The book draws on the history of China, Korea, and Japan, and includes information on families, clans, caste, and honor. The original Oriental Adventures introduced two major innovations to the AD&D; system. Although previous TSR publications, such as Deities & Demigods, had touched on using non-European settings for the game, Oriental Adventures was the first official supplement devoted entirely to roleplaying in a non-Western setting. Oriental Adventures also introduced a new game mechanic to Dungeons & Dragons; it was the first official supplement to include rules for non-weapon proficiencies.* David Cook, \\"Oriental opens new vistas\\", Dragon 104:20-21, Dec 1985. Every character is expected to possess proficiencies in the noncombat arts with skills such as calligraphy, etiquette, animal handling, iaijutsu (fast draw), and bowyer. Both non-weapon proficiencies and non-European settings were explored in more detail in the 2nd edition AD&D; rules. The book includes an honor system, in which honor points are lost when a character fails to behave in a correct fashion or uphold the family name; eventually the character sheet is simply thrown away, if such behavior continues. Personal honor is also reflected in the honor of a character's family. The character's family background is also determined by a system which generates a character's immediate family and ancestors, determines family honor and status, and also provides characters with their birthrights. Also included are detailed rules for karate and other martial arts styles. These rules allow the Dungeon Master to construct new martial arts styles and techniques by choosing from a range of menu options. All characters may study martial arts, provided they can find masters to teach them; monks and shukenja start their adventuring lives with some martial arts training. Each character class also has its own unique ki powers, which become more effective as characters advance through each level. The original Oriental Adventures includes a long background section on the fantasy setting known as Kara-Tur. Kara-Tur was later made a continent of Abeir-Toril. TSR went on to produce eight adventure modules using the Oriental Adventures rules and the Kara-Tur setting. Gary Gygax intended to incorporate the material from Oriental Adventures into revised versions of the Players Handbook and Dungeon Masters Guide,Gary Gygax, \\"The future of the game\\", Dragon 103:8-10, Nov 1985. but left TSR shortly after announcing the project.Gary Gygax, \\"From the Sorcerer's Scroll\\", Dragon 122:40, Oct 1987. Oriental Adventures was TSR's biggest seller in 1985. Little, if any, material from Oriental Adventures was incorporated into the AD&D; 2nd Edition core books, and Oriental Adventures itself was never revised for a 2nd Edition. =Reception= Ashley Shepherd reviewed Oriental Adventures for issue No. 74 of White Dwarf magazine, giving it an overall rating of 9 out of 10. Shepherd felt that the book was not so much a sourcebook but \\"a completely new version of AD&D.; \\"The old stand-bys of the AD&D; system are still in the rules, but the elements have been intelligently modified to produce something that is far greater than the sum of its parts.\\" Sheperd felt that the character classes each had a twist which made them interesting and worth playing. Sheperd noted that the monk was in its proper Eastern context, and that the ninja was the best version the reviewer had seen. Shepherd stated that the skill system of \\"proficiency slots\\" was a \\"sensible extension of the character rules, and should be extended to cover the whole system, not just this Eastern supplement\\". Shepherd also felt that the honor system was a good touch, and that the real strength of the new martial arts system was that the Dungeon Master was now able to construct any number of new styles. Shepherd compared the sourcebook favorably with Bushido, another oriental role-playing game of the time, feeling that Oriental Adventures was a better choice as a game system. Shepherd concluded the review by saying, \\"By remaining compatible with the rest of AD&D;, Dave Cook has written an excellent set of rules which should be very popular. Oriental Adventures has even persuaded me to start playing AD&D; again.\\" Jim Bambra reviewed Oriental Adventures for Dragon magazine #134, June 1988. Bambra felt that with Oriental Adventures, the AD&D; game made the transition to the Orient \\"with style\\", complete with new character classes and spells that \\"admirably capture the flavor of the Orient, and the inclusion of nonhuman character types\\". Bambra felt that the book's martial artist system \\"really shines\\", as it \\"gives practitioners a wide range from which to choose and adds a very interesting dimension to combat\\". He concluded that \\"Oriental Adventures is solidly Oriental in feel and is an excellent addition to the AD&D; game.\\" =Reviews= * Casus Belli #30 (Jan 1986) =Other releases= TSR released several products with the Oriental Adventures logo . This includes a series of modules numbered OA1 to OA7, the first five of which (Swords of the Daimyo, Night of the Seven Swords, Ochimo: The Spirit Warrior, Blood of the Yakuza, and Mad Monkey vs. the Dragon Claw) were released for first edition AD&D.; The sixth module (Ronin Challenge) was released for the second edition, as was the seventh module (Test of the Samurai) which did not have the Oriental Adventures logo. The last three of these modules also had the Forgotten Realms logo. The Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms boxed set, also for Forgotten Realms, was billed as an expansion for Oriental Adventures.

Another early and more noble helmet video camera was a 1977 head-mounted camera designed to convert images into tactile sensations for the blind. Almost a decade later, a Canon CI-10 camera was mounted to the side of Dick Garcia's helmet by Aerial Video Systems (AVS) of Burbank, CA at the Nissan USGP 500 World Championship at Carlsbad Raceway in Carlsbad, CA on June 28, 1986. At this time the helmet camera was used commercially. For the first time, images were transmitted live from this camera by AVS via portable microwave to the ABC broadcast truck, then integrated into their live broadcast. This innovative system showed viewers the rider's Point of View of the race as it unfolded. Mark Schulze wearing helmet cam in The Great Mountain Biking Video in 1987 Another early innovator of video helmet camera technology was Mark Schulze, who created a system for use while producing The Great Mountain Biking Video in 1987.\\"Going Hollywood,\\" Mountain & City Biking Magazine, April 1989http://mountainbiketales.com/articles/patty0610.htm Mountain Bike Tales \\"Schulze stripped-down a red motorcycle helmet and jury-rigged a mounting for the first consumer color video chip camera. A cable ran from the camera to a padded backpack that contained a Panasonic VHS portable video recorder and a DC-lead-acid battery for power, which made the rig heavy, unwieldy, and hot. This pioneering technology brought an engaging perspective to live sports television and action sports videos and eventually gave way to button and lipstick cameras. The helmet cam then became a standard piece of equipment, worn by umpires, catchers, goalies and referees for live television as well as BMX riders, surfers, skiers, skydivers, hockey and soccer players and other sports aficionados, to record and share their experiences.Sports Video Innovations http://www.sportsvideoinnovations.com/The Daily Dot \\"This hockey ref's helmet cam is the future of televised sports\\" by Michelle Jaworski ‚Äî Dec 23, 2013 at 2:47PM http://www.dailydot.com/unclick/hockey-ref-helmet-cam- footage/Motor Racing, \\"Helmet cam gives you driver's perspective of a lap at the Nurburgring\\" By Samuel Reiman, May 20, 2016 at 10:49a ET http://www.foxsports.com/motor/story/video-nurburgring-helmet-camera-052016The Salt Lake Tribune, \\"College football: Helmet cams could give teams a new point of view\\" By Lya Wodraska The Salt Lake Tribune First Published Aug 16 2015 10:54AM, http://www.sltrib.com/home/2785043-155/college-football-helmet-cams- could-give In 1991, the World League of American Football introduced the innovation of a miniature camera mounted on the right side of the VSR-3 Riddell helmet worn by quarterbacks. This rig was developed by USA Network and Aerial Video Systems (AVS). An antenna was placed in the crown of the helmet between an inflatable pad and the shell. Each of these Helmet-Cams cost $20,000 and transmitted live game action.Nancy Gay, The Sentinel Staff, March 24, 1991 These helmet cams were briefly used to provide live player's-eye-view footage in professional American football. However, their use was discontinued after players complained of the extra weight, and TV networks became concerned about the aggressive behavior the cameras captured. In 2002, after graduating with a degree in Visual Arts from UCSD, Nick Woodman, a long-time surfer, created the GoPro camera. This was a small, wearable camera with a waterproof housing for people to share their personal experiences in sports and other endeavors with the world.Advertising Age \\"How GoPro CEO Nick Woodman Let Consumers Lead Him to New Idea\\" By Ken Wheaton.

Although helmet cameras take on a variety of forms, the majority are small cylindrical cameras resembling a tube of lipstick or a bullet. Helmet cameras may be connected to a video recording device with video input capability, such as a handheld camcorder, or purpose built digital video recorder. CCD helmet cameras are based upon the charge- coupled device (CCD) image sensor. They typically operate on 12 VDC power and output an analog type signal. These cameras draw more power than CMOS cameras but offer superior picture quality and better color replication. CMOS helmet cameras are based upon the complementary metal‚Äìoxide‚Äìsemiconductor (CMOS) image sensor. They typically operate on 5 VDC and draw very little power. CMOS cameras are also generally smaller than the CCD type.  Applications  US soldier in Afghanistan with a personal helmet camera, 2010. Action camera that mounts on helmet and elsewhere Many sports enthusiasts use helmet cameras to capture the essence of the sports they love. For example, many paraglider pilots carry a bullet camera to record their flights. This can be mounted on the helmet, foot or elsewhere to capture unique camera angles. There are many samples of helmet camera videos available on the net. Wearing helmet cameras is also proving popular with cyclists as a safety aid as it allows cyclists to record their journeys and to record any incidents from their point of view. This recording can be used in a court as evidence. In 2006, a British cyclist was convicted of abusing traffic wardens, using evidence from a helmet camera. Also in 2006, in the documentary Race To Dakar, Charley Boorman, Matt Hall and Simon Pavey used helmet cams to document their participation the 2006 Dakar rally. Out of the trio, Pavey was the only member of the \\"Race To Dakar\\" team wearing the camera to make it to the Senagalese Capital and (the rally's finish). In 2011, Ben Maher won the Martin Collins Eraser Stakes at London Olympia horse show while wearing a helmet camera. Firefighters have begun to utilize helmet cams as a tool to assess their responses to fires and allow non-firefighters to see the reality of what occurs inside a burning building. One technological improvement that fire departments would employ would be thermal imaging detection of differences in heat.http://www.ktvu.com/news/26895905/detail.html Menlo Park Firefighters Start Using Unique Helmet Cameras, February 16, 2011 Helmet cameras are also being used in the military, where video footage can be streamed back to a command center or military outpost. A notable instance of this was the raid on Osama Bin Laden‚Äôs compound, where live video footage of the raid is believed to have been streamed to the White House. In 2013 a British Royal Marine soldier was convicted of murder after shooting to death an unarmed and injured Afghan insurgent, contrary to the Geneva Convention. The incident had been recorded by a helmet camera whose images and sound were used in evidence at a court martial relating to the incident.

As a result of its influence, he was at the age of seventeen converted to Christianity and baptized into the Lutheran Church at Erlangen on November 6, 1819.Masur, Gerhard (1930). Friedrich Julius Stahl, Geschichte seines Lebens. Aufstieg und Entfaltung 1802‚Äì1840. Berlin: Mittler. p. 20-37. To this faith he clung with earnest devotion and persistence until his death. Having studied law at W√ºrzburg, Heidelberg and Erlangen, Stahl, on taking the degree of doctor juris, established himself as Privatdozent in Munich, was appointed (1832) ordinary professor of law at W√ºrzburg, and in 1840 received the chair of ecclesiastical law and polity at Berlin. Here he immediately made his mark as an ecclesiastical lawyer, and was appointed a member of the first chamber of the general synod. Elected in 1850 a member of the short-lived Erfurt parliament, he bitterly opposed the idea of German federation. Stahl early fell under the influence of Schelling, and at the latter's insistence, began in 1827 his great work Die Philosophie des Rechts nach geschichtlicher Ansicht (an historical view of the philosophy of law), in which he bases all law and political science upon Christian revelation, denies rationalistic doctrines, and, as a deduction from this principle, maintains that a state church must be strictly confessional. This position he further elucidated in his Der christliche Staat und sein Verh√§ltniss zum Deismus und Judenthum (The Christian State and its relation to Deism and Judaism; 1847). As Oberkirchenrath (synodal councillor), Stahl used all his influence to weaken the Prussian Union of churches (i.e. that compromise between the Calvinist and Lutheran doctrines which is the essence of the Evangelical Church in Prussia) and to strengthen the influence of the Lutheran Church (cf. Die Lutherische Kirche und die Union, 1859). Stahl advocated the formation of an episcopal constitution of the Lutherans, similar to Roman Catholics or Anglicans.Mattes, Mark C (2002). \\"The Thomistic Turn in Evangelical Catholic Ethics.\\" The Lutheran Quarterly, vol. 16, p. 65-101; here: p. 67. The Prussian minister von Bunsen attacked him, while King Frederick William IV supported Stahl in his ecclesiastical policy, and the Prussian Union would probably have been dissolved had not the regency of Prince William (afterwards William I, German Emperor) supervened in 1858. Stahl's influence fell under the new r√©gime, and, while remaining a member of the Prussian House of Lords (\\"Herrenhaus\\"), he resigned his seat on the general synod. While taking a cure he unexpectedly died at Bad Br√ºckenau. Selected works *Die Philosophie des Rechts nach geschichtlicher Ansicht (3 volumes).

It is the type species of its genus. Distribution and ecology The huchen is endemic to the Danube basin in Europe where the remaining population is threatened primarily by habitat fragmentation and loss through river impoundment and disruption of the longitudinal continuity of rivers, cutting away fish from its spawning grounds. Additionally, overfishing and fisheries mismanagement is still a problem in many areas, especially in the Balkans. The upper reaches of the Danube basin, rivers and tributaries contain almost all of the recent population. This includes: *In: the Inn river, the upper Drava in Lower Austria, with the lower Gail in Carinthia, the Pielach, in Styria the upper Mur. *In Germany: middle and lower Inn In the Balkans huchen still appears in following river systems: *In Slovenia: in the headwaters of Sava and its tributaries. *In Croatia: in the upper and middle course of Kupa. *In Bosnia and Herzegovina: in the upper and middle Una, with the upper and middle Sana; the upper and middle Vrbas, with the lower and middle Vrbanja; the main channel of the Bosna lost its population due to degradation of its waters, its banks and riverbed, but its four main tributaries, the Krivaja, the Fojniƒçka, the La≈°va and the ≈Ωeljeznica, are still important habitats; one of the most important huchen habitats in Balkan and Europe is the Drina, with its numerous tributaries, especially the Lim, the Tara and the ƒÜehotina, and smaller ones, the Bistrica, the Praƒça, and the Drinjaƒça; * In Serbia: the Lim. * In Montenegro: the Lim, with the Lake Plav, the ƒÜehotina, and the Tara. Some of these habitats, especially in the Balkans, are endangered with planned, or already implemented plans for construction of new dams and hydroelectric power plants, such as on the Lim in Serbia, or like in case of the river Piva in Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina, whose respective populations were completely wiped out since mid 20th century. In some cases rehabilitation of parts of the habitat is attempted, through restoration of the river course. Such positive example is the part of the course of the river Inn, with some -long stretch around the Bavarian town of M√ºhldorf was rebuilt and renaturalized and the huchen has returned in recent years. It has been introduced to other major river basins elsewhere on the continent and even North Africa, to rivers in Morocco, but these populations are not self- sustaining. Some evidence suggest that in historic times the huchen has also been found in the neighboring Dniester basin. Huchen sometimes successfully establish in accessible natural lakes, like glacial Lake Plav which is the source of the Lim river in Montenegro, one of the major huchen habitats in the Balkans. However, the species sometimes survives even when cut off from the rest of the population in big dam reservoirs on mountain rivers, such as reservoirs on the Drina in Bosnia, or Lake Czorsztyn in Poland, as long as competitive and/or allochthonous predator species are not introduced into the newly created lakes. Appearance and behaviour The huchen reaches about in length and more than in weight. The average length is between . The huchen has a slender body that is nearly round in cross-section. On the reddish brown back are several dark patches in an X or crescent shape, but most distinctive feature is fishes head, which is larger than in other salmonides (longer and wider), with large elongated mouth. Smaller fish feed on the larvae of water insects or on insects dropped into the water; the larger individuals are predators of other species of fish and other small vertebrates. =Historical occurrence= There is no international convention nor single agreed body concerned with verification of records and mandated with the task, however there are many modern and historical records for the largest huchen caught. Among these recorded is fish weighing , caught in February 1985 in Spittal an der Drau in Austria,; also one weighing , which is stuffed and was probably grown on fish-farm in Austria for breeding. Other storied examples of recorded specimens with existing photographs and media reports include , caught in January 1938 by Bosnian railway worker and angler Halil Sofrad≈æija at the Dragojeviƒáa Rapids on the Drina river, near the town of Ustikolina in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This case was recorded on photograph and reportage was later published in prime Serbian daily Politika on 23 February 1938. D≈æevat ≈†arkinoviƒá, angler from Plav, caught Danube salmon weighting , long, in late spring of 1985 in lake Plav, and gave it to Hotel \\"Plavsko jezero\\" who presented it at International Fair of Hunting and Fishing in Novi Sad where it was noted as a \\"world record\\". Today, this specimen stands as stuffed exhibit at the wall of hotel's foyer in Plav. Another recorded trophy from the Drina include huchen caught by angler Remzija Krkaliƒá from Foƒça in 1940, weighing . Reproduction This permanent freshwater salmonid spawns in April, once water reaches a temperature of . For spawning, the huchen migrates up the river and enters small and shallow affluents, where females excavate depressions in the gravel into which they deposit their eggs, then a male releases a cloud of sperm and the female then covers the eggs with sand. Larvae hatch 30 to 35 days after fertilization. Commercial breeding Inn River huchen (1913) There is a considerable effort to produce huchen fry commercially and to reintroduce the species into the wild with moderate to good success. This requires catching the adults just before spawning and keeping them in special tanks. Fry are released in appropriate places once they have reached .

He was born in New York City. For his work on Mary Poppins, he shared Academy Award nominations for Best Picture with Walt Disney, and for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium with Don DaGradi. He died in Los Angeles and was interred in Glendale's Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery. In 1970 an article in Variety listed him as the second most successful film producer of all time in terms of money- earning movies even though he was \\"a guy no one's ever heard of\\".WEST VIEW BY BURT PRELUTSKY: Superhack Los Angeles Times 20 Dec 1970: w6. Biography =Early life= Walsh was born in 1913 to immigrant parents in New York. He was raised in Cincinnati by his aunt and uncle, Agnes and William Newman. He played football at Purcell and wrote sports for the Cincinnati Commercial Tribune. In 1934 he accepted a University of Cincinnati athletic scholarship. =Early career= While at UC, Walsh produced a freshman show that happened to be seen by Barbara Stanwyck and Frank Fay who were passing through town in a show, Tattle Tales. They hired Walsh at $12 a week to rewrite the show, which went to Broadway where it ran for five weeks. Walsh then followed Stanwyck and Fay to Hollywood. He worked as a press agent for 15 years at the Ettinger Company and started writing jokes as a sideline on the suggestion of client Edgar Buchanan.Bill Walsh, 61, Movie Writer, Producer, Dies Los Angeles Times 28 Jan 1975: a19. =Disney comic strips= He joined the Disney company in 1943 as a press agent and began writing the Mickey Mouse comic strip as a sideline.BILL WALSH, 61, DIES; A DISNEY PRODUCER, New York Times 29 Jan 1975: 35. \\"Mickey Mouse was very dull and kind of stupid,\\" Walsh later said. \\"Donald Duck was the one I liked. He had complete licence. He had pizzaz.\\" Nevertheless, he continued to write the daily strip for more than twenty years, partnering with artist Floyd Gottfredson on dozens of stories until 1955, when the strip changed formats to become a gag-a-day strip. Walsh continued writing the gag strip until 1964, when he passed it on to Roy Williams. While at Disney, Walsh also wrote gags for the \\"Panchito\\" stories in the Silly Symphony comic strip (1944‚Äì45), and created the Uncle Remus and His Tales of Br'er Rabbit Sunday strip (1945‚Äì46). =Television= In the late 1940s Disney put Walsh in charge of their television operations. He wrote and produced television specials, starting with One Hour in Wonderland (1950). Walsh produced a number of huge successes, including Davy Crockett (1954‚Äì55) and The Mickey Mouse Club (1955-59). He also wrote the feature The Littlest Outlaw (1955) and produced a number of serials that aired as part of The Mickey Mouse Club, including Spin and Marty, Corky and White Shadow, The Hardy Boys: The Mystery of the Applegate Treasure, Adventure in Dairyland, The Adventures of Clint and Mac, and Walt Disney Presents: Annette. He moved up to features in 1959.Disney on TV: A reminiscence of how it all began Walsh, Bill. Los Angeles Times 29 Dec 1974: k29. =Features= Walsh wrote and produced The Shaggy Dog (1959) with Fred MacMurray, Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran. A fantasy comedy made for relatively little money it was a huge hit and became the most profitable Disney film of all time. The same team then made Toby Tyler (1959), a circus film that was well received critically though not as popular. Walsh wrote and produced a series of comedies starring MacMurray and Kirk, all very popular: The Absent-Minded Professor (1961), a fantasy; Bon Voyage! (1962), an Americans-abroad family comedy, also with Corcoran; and Son of Flubber (1963), a sequel to Absent Minded Professor. He provided the story for The Misadventures of Merlin Jones (1964), a fantasy comedy with Kirk. Walsh co wrote the musical Mary Poppins' (1964) which became the most popular movie Disney ever released. He wrote it with Don DaGradi who would be Walsh's most regular collaborator - Walsh normally worked with a co-writer, or supervised other writers. Walsh wrote and produced That Darn Cat! (1965), Lt. Robin Crusoe, U.S.N. (1966) and Blackbeard's Ghost (1968). =Post-Walt Disney= After Walt Disney's death in 1966 Walsh was part of the seven man committee who ran the company.Disney After Disney: Roy & the Seven Champlin, Charles.

Los Angeles Times 18 Mar 1969: g1. In 1970 Walsh said \\"I make movies for people between the ages of nine and fourteen. It's a very intelligent and very honest audience... Also I don't make personal statements; I make movies hoping they'll make money so I'll be able to make more movies. I'm a schlock hack and I glory in it. My folks had a tent show and if you tried to make personal statements for audiences in Kentucky and Tennessee they'd burn the tent down.\\" He said he never wanted to direct because \\"I have flat feet... you have to get up too early\\" and \\"you have to talk to actors.\\" He wrote and produced Scandalous John (1971) which he said was his favourite film even though it was the only one to have lost money. Far more popular was Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971). In 1971 Walsh said his main contributions to the films were \\"fantasy...

It is classed by the World Health Organization as an intermediate soft tissue tumor related to the sarcoma family.

Head and neck desmoid fibromatosis is a serious condition due to local aggression, specific anatomical patterns and the high rate of relapse. For children surgery is particularly difficult, given the potential for growth disorders.(webpage has a translation button) Treatment includes prompt radical excision with a wide margin and/or radiation. Despite their local infiltrative and aggressive behavior, mortality is minimal to nonexistent for peripheral tumours. In intra-abdominal fibromatosis associated with Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), surgery is avoided if possible due to high rates of recurrence within the abdomen carrying significant morbidity and mortality. Conversely, for intra-abdominal fibromatosis without evidence of FAP extensive surgery may still be required for local symptoms, but the risk of recurrence is low. Terminology Other names include \\"musculoaponeurotic fibromatosis,\\" referring to the tendency of these tumors to be adjacent to and infiltrating deep skeletal muscle, aggressive fibromatosis and \\"desmoid tumor.\\" A clear difference should be made between intra-abdominal and extra-abdominal localizations.

Composed of over 400 men and women from the school's Corps of Cadets, it is the largest military marching band in the world. The band's complex straight-line marching maneuvers are performed exclusively to traditional marches. Since its inception in 1894, its members eat together, sleep in the same dormitories, and practice up to forty hours per week on top of a full academic schedule. The Aggie Band performs at all home football games, some away games, and university and Corps functions throughout the year. The band has also participated in inauguration parades for many United States Presidents and Texas Governors, major annual parades across the country, and the dedication ceremony for the George H. W. Bush Presidential Library. History =Early years= The Aggie Band owes its existence to Joseph Holick (born in 1868 in Moravia). In 1885, Holick and his brother Louis boarded an empty boxcar bound for Orange, Texas so that they could gain employment in a lumber mill. En route, the two stopped in Bryan, Texas, near the campus of the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas. The 22-year-old Holick began to doubt his choice, stating, \\"I was a small boy and couldn't do lumbering work\\", and chose to remain in Bryan working under Raymond Blatherwick, owner of a prominent boot shop. Lawrence Sullivan Ross, the president of the nearby college and a former Governor of Texas, stopped into Blatherwick's boot shop and noted how inconvenient it was for cadets to go to Bryan for their boots. Ross requested Holick be stationed at the new military college to perform cobbler duties. The Aggie Band's first 13 members led by Joseph Holick Holick accepted the proposal and moved to work at Texas A&M.; Shortly after his arrival, the Commandant's staff discovered his musical talents. They requested him to play the bugle for Corps functions and for US$65 a month, he was assigned to play Reveille and Taps. Because the new job paid much more than his previous one, Holick wanted to give the school \\"more than just two tunes for its money and he asked the commandant for permission to start a cadet band\\". The commandant agreed and named Holick its first bandmaster. Under his tutelage and the leadership of subsequent bandmasters, the band grew from 13 members at its inception in 1894 to 75 bandsmen in 1924. Early drum majors are credited with inspiring the band's name. The first student drum major, H.A. \\"California\\" Morse, was asked to leave the college due to fighting. In addition, the early drum majors were chosen in physical combat; insomuch that the candidates were placed in a locked room, with the best fighter / the one emerging victorious, being named to the coveted position. This tradition of aggressiveness and physical combat was noted by band members, who then took to calling themselves the Fightin' Texas Aggie Band. =Dunn years= \\"ATM\\" formation during halftime at Kyle Field, a variation of the \\"Block T\\" created by Dunn senior Boots, which Dunn tried to eliminate. In 1924, Lieutenant Colonel Richard J. Dunn was appointed as bandmaster. As a former member of John Philip Sousa's Marine Band and with 26 years of military band leadership experience, Dunn quickly instituted changes within the band. The first was to the position of bugler, whose duties had fallen to the bandmaster since 1894. When informed that he was expected to fill the role, Dunn told college officials, \\"I have blown enough bugles. I am the Bandmaster. Someone else can blow the bugle calls.\\" From then on, the Corps Bugler was chosen from the ranks of the Aggie Band. Dunn also instituted uniform changes which added white canvas to the band uniform, resulting in a \\"flash effect\\" every other step. Dunn tried, to no avail, to rid the band of the Senior Boots, but this tradition was too well-established. Other additions included crossed white belts, later discarded in favor of a white Sam Browne belt, silver buckles, and the addition of a bugle rank to lead the band in its maneuvers. Changes in the drills included the \\"Block T\\", the band's signature, and such intricate designs which led to talk amongst fans about the band \\"always winning halftime\\". Under Dunn's experience, the band instituted some traditions that the university uses to the present. In 1925, Marvin H. Mimms wrote the lyrics for an alma mater for the school. Dunn, who found the Aggie War Hymn \\"inappropriate\\" for social functions and solemn occasions, wrote its accompanying music and presented it to the student body titled Spirit of Aggieland. In 1926, the tradition of Elephant Walk began when two seniors in the band led a procession of seniors throughout the school grounds visiting all the important places on campus. All the seniors in one single file was \\"quite a site to behold\\", and one junior commented that they looked like a bunch of old elephants wandering around trying to find some place to die. The name stuck and the tradition continues to the present. Beginning in 1939, the U.S. Army required all cadets to be in either infantry or field artillery units. Therefore, the band was split into two separate units at opposite ends of the campus dormitories and named Infantry and Artillery Bands. When the two units performed together, they formed the Combined Band. 1942 saw the band expand to 250 members, but the need for manpower for the war effort caused membership to plummet. By the end of the 1942-1943 school year, it dropped it to only 90 bandsmen. As \\"a crusty old army man\\", Dunn understood the nation's urgent need for troops, and he accepted the fact that the Aggie Band could only return after the war was over. Along with conducting the Aggie Band, Dunn started his own orchestra with the newly built A&M; Consolidated High School on the Texas A&M; Campus, called the \\"Little Symphony Orchestra\\". Dunn was also the founder of the famous A&M; Consolidated High School Tiger Band in 1947. =Adams era= The 2007‚Äì2008 Aggie Band performs a countermarch, a maneuver first introduced by Colonel Adams. Dunn once told then-cadet Edward Vergne Adams, \\"One day I want you to direct this band.\\" Adams thought the Colonel was joking, but \\"went to music school after graduation just in case he wasn't\\". After music school, he joined the army and put his musical skills to rest for the duration of the war, with one exception: while on regimental staff during the retreat ceremony at the end of the day, the assigned bugler had no experience and couldn't play a single note, so Adams stepped out of formation, took the bugle from the bugler's hands, blew the appropriate calls, handed the bugle back, and marched back into his spot in the formation. This intolerance for incompetence served him well when he accepted the invitation of Dunn to be his replacement as director of the Aggie Band. Adams began his tenure with an undisciplined band devoid of experience and ravaged by years of war, but in his first year of leadership, the ranks of the band quickly swelled to 225 members. Infantry and field artillery associations were no longer required by the Army and Adams changed the units' names to the Maroon and White Bands. Adams began to make the drills far more intricate and precise than they had been in the past by adding a countermarch, maneuvers from the Army Drill Manual, and established a 30-inch (76 cm) step, or six steps for every five yards (4.57m), as the band standard. Adams also added the criss- cross maneuver. First performed November 27, 1947 at the annual Thanksgiving Day game with the University of Texas, the criss-cross maneuver and its later variations (specifically the four-way cross) became the band's most anticipated maneuver. Other band directors said it was impossible to do because it required two people to be in the same place at the same time (indeed, to this day computer programs that chart band formations say that this maneuver cannot be performed). To accomplish this, band members step between each other's feet. In later years, people who did not know that the maneuver was first done in 1947 claimed that the drill was designed by a computer. Adams explained, \\"It's all a matter of mathematics. One man can take up only a certain amount of space at one time and moves in one direction at a predictable rate of speed.\\" E.V. Adams Band Hall The band's reputation spread and other bands had begun to have some apprehension about performing in the same halftime as the Aggie Band. One Southwest Conference band director stated, \\"I dread going against the Aggie Band.... What is so humiliating is to see the Aggie Band do things band directors talk about as being impossible, and do them perfectly. It takes two weeks to recover from the trauma.\\" In 1960, \\"one band gave up without a fight\\": the Trinity Tiger Band opted to sit instead of perform and gave the Aggie Band the entire halftime to perform. During Adams' tenure, the college acquired a new mascot, the first since the original Reveille died in 1944. Reveille II, like the original Reveille, was cared for and attended to by band members. During halftime performances, the young dog was allowed to be on the field with the band without her leash. During these breaks where she could get out and run, she had a tendency to \\"do her business\\" on Kyle Field's playing surface. This didn't bother the band members much, as Reveille stayed away from the band, but Adams discovered a gambling scheme whereby cadets were taking bets on what yard line the dog would defecate. He quickly ended the practice and turned the responsibility of caring for Reveille over to Company E-2, which has since been called the Mascot Company. On October 7, 1967, the first meeting of the Aggie Band Association took place to support the band. The organization, composed of former members and supporters, continue to assist the band through fundraising, scholarships, instrument repair, and general welfare of the cadets in the band. In 1970, Adams acquired funds and built a new band hall which was named in his honor. =Modernization and expansion= The Joe T. Haney Drill Field, considered by bandsmen to be a \\"working memorial\\" as the ashes of some former bandsmen have been scattered across it The Haney Drill Field ceased to be used by the Aggie Band in November 2018. Notice the ruts created by constant formation marching. Colonel Joe T. Haney took over the band in 1973. He felt his obligation was, \\"not to build up the band ... [but] to keep it at its already exceptional level\\". During Haney's years, the band expanded to include a concert band, a symphonic band, the Aggieland Orchestra, and a Drum and Bugle Corps, and the names of the two subunits reverted to their earlier designations of Infantry and Artillery Bands. This simple philosophy was tested as Texas A&M; transitioned from an all-male military college to a coeducational research university. The addition of women to the Corps presented some challenges, including one high-profile lawsuit and fierce resistance from former Corps and Band members. When women were finally admitted to the band under court order (Fall Semester, 1985); the first three women had to be housed in a separate dorm until accommodations could be made within the band dorms. Reporters were relentless and Haney finally called an open press conference with the three young ladies. The female cadets refused pictures unless their fish buddies (members of their freshman class in their unit) were included in the photos. With a band dropout rate of 33% the odds were against all of the female cadets succeeding, only Andrea Abat remained in the band through her senior year. Haney realized the separate living conditions were not conducive to good order and discipline and integrated the dorms, grouping females at one end of the dorm and designating one bathroom for exclusive female use. Amidst these drastic changes, large proportions of the freshmen classes (some as high as 30%) contained all-state high school band members. As the band's experience and musical talents grew, the quality of the music improved dramatically. Haney even rewrote the drills to include a portion where the band stopped moving and played to the audience. This innovation was well received and became a staple of the band's repertoire. In 1975, at a televised game versus the University of Arkansas, the Aggie Band was repeatedly asked to play music during lulls in the game. By the fourth quarter, the Aggie Band had played on TV during every break and Colonel Haney, trying his best to be fair, told the cameraman that they really should let the Razorback Band play a little too. The cameraman called up to the broadcast booth to get guidance and then replied, \\"The director doesn't want to hear the Arkansas band, he wants to hear the Aggie Band.\\" The drills became even more complicated as Haney added formations and maneuvers never before seen. The excellence shown on the field belied its heavy dependence on precision. On October 24, 1981 the band suffered a serious misstep during the halftime show at Rice University when four members of a lead element turned early and, before anyone could make a correction, colliding band members ground the drill to a halt. With so many members doing exactly what the person in front of them does with mere inches of clearance, the cascade effect was unrecoverable and the band simply stopped and left the field. Although it was first rumored that the collision was intended to mock the Rice Marching Owl Band, and later that Rice students were using whistles to throw off the band's response to drum major whistle commands, all of the rumors proved to be unsubstantiated. Thereafter the band performed all drills in Houston without whistle commands. The following weekend the band attempted their most complicated drill and performed flawlessly. Each subsequent week, the drills became more complicated. The Bryan-College Station Eagle's editor opined, \\"A&M; is probably the only school anywhere that throws in a free football game with its performance. One of these days, I fully expect the band to be invited to a bowl game--and to be told it can bring along its football team if it wants to.\\" =Into a new millennium= Drummers from the Aggie Band leading the football team into Kyle Field. Lieutenant Colonel Ray E. Toler, a Texas Christian University graduate, replaced Haney when he stepped down in 1989. As a veteran of many Air Force Bands and with a Grammy Award nomination under his belt, Toler was quick to realize the potential and traditions of the Aggie Band and quickly set about publicizing it. Under his direction, the Aggie Band began a weekly television show (the \\"Texas Aggie Band Show\\") that showcased the band, the Corps of Cadets, and the daily life of a band member. As of 2007, the Aggie Band is the only university or college band with its own weekly television show. The Aggie Band was recognized nationally as the 2001 recipient of the Louis Sudler Trophy for collegiate marching bands, administered by the John Philip Sousa Foundation. During Toler's leadership of the Aggie Band, its presence was personally requested by President-elect George W. Bush for his inauguration parade. During Toler's tenure, many of the Aggie drills and music were written by Dr. Timothy Rhea, who succeeded Toler as Director of Bands in 2002. Rhea actively arranges and composes music, which has been published by TRN Music Publisher, RBC Music Publisher, and Arranger's Publishing Company. After the 2018-2019 school year, the Aggie Band ceased using the Adams Band Hall and Haney Drill Field, in preparation for its move to the new Music Activities Center (MAC). This facility considerably increases rehearsal space for the band and includes a turf drill field, which is not susceptible to the ruts and holes often created on Haney due to constant marching. The move to the MAC requires the Aggie Band to vacate its traditional dormitories - Dorms 9 and 11, the latter of which was custom-built for the band in 1939 - in favor of dormitories closer to the new facility. The Haney Drill Field was used by the Aggie Band for approximately 75 years.https://today.tamu.edu/2019/05/16/music-activities-center-on-track-for- aug-30-opening/ On December 6, 2018, a select contingent of the Aggie Band performed at the burial of U.S. President George H. W. Bush on the Texas A&M; campus. The band played the presidential salute \\"Hail to the Chief\\" and the \\"Texas Aggie War Hymn\\" as Bush's casket was removed from the funeral train. Although a United States Air Force band performed \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" as Bush's casket arrived at the burial site, they did not play \\"Hail to the Chief,\\" making the Aggie Band's performance the last time the late president was saluted with this piece. Cadet life A senior cadet from the band carrying a sabre; note the brass lyre on the collar indicating this cadet is from the band. Band freshmen (at left) receive corrective physical training, supervised by upperclassmen The Aggie Band is unique among college bands; no other band eats and lives together as a military unit, even at the Service Academies and military colleges. Bandsmen wear their cadet uniforms to class, drill, meetings, and other functions on campus. As a requested component of football away games, they perform at more football games than any other band. As of 1993, the band performed at 125 of the last 131 football games, including a streak of 42 straight from 1981 to 1984. Demand is extremely high for the band and one person, upon finding out the Aggie Band would not be performing at the local football game versus A&M;, returned and requested a refund for 40 tickets. The Aggie Band performs a new show each week during the football season and does not generally repeat drills from week to week. During the fall semester, the Aggie Band practices for 90 minutes every weekday morning and on Saturdays every week with a football game. In addition, some components of the band also practice on Sunday afternoons and planning of the drills takes place throughout the fall semester. All told, drills can take eight to nine hours per week on top of a full academic schedule and Corps/ROTC activities. All seniors in the Corps of Cadets wear distinctive cavalry riding boots with their uniforms. These boots usually cost more than $1,800 and are generally made at Holick's, formerly owned by the family of Joseph Holick, the first band director. Aggie Band organizational structure as of 2017 The 2007‚Äì2008 Aggie Band Drum Major = Organization = The members of the band are called BQsThe historical basis for this lies in the history of the band as being part of the Corps of Cadets. When first arriving to A&M;, cadets' personnel folders were stamped with \\"CT\\", for Cadet-in-Training, or \\"BQ\\" for Band Qualified. Over the years, good-natured banter between the cadets resulted in other interpretations for these letters. CTs became \\"Corps Turds\\" and BQs became Band Queers. See the list of Texas Aggie terms for more information and, since the band's inception, are part of the Corps of Cadets. The Aggie Band is a major unit in the Corps, comparable in size to a brigade or wing. Unique among Corps units, however, the band is divided into two battalions of three \\"outfits\\" each, the Infantry Band and the Artillery Band. All BQs are assigned to one of the six outfits. Each battalion is commanded by a Cadet Lieutenant Colonel and has its own command staff; each outfit is commanded by a Cadet Major. Outfits are further divided into platoons, squads, and fire teams, lead by a Cadet Captain, Cadet Staff Sergeant, and Cadet Corporal, respectively. Due to its status as a Senior Military College, all cadets are required to take ROTC classes at least their first two years, though follow-on military service is not required. From 1948, the Maroon and White Bands functioned as single outfits, with the band as a whole functioning as an independent battalion. When the Infantry and Artillery Bands were reestablished in 1976, they were divided into two outfits each: A-Company and B-Company in the Infantry Band, and A-Battery and B-Battery in the Artillery Band. C-Company and C-Battery existed briefly from 1983-1984, then were permanently reactivated in 2013. =Leadership= Unlike many bands, the drum majors are not in charge of the band as a whole. Since the band is part of the Corps, it has its own unit commander, a Cadet Colonel. Due to necessity for military functions, the Band Commander is accorded the privilege of the first file in bugle rank (the lead rank of the band). During formal military ceremonies, the commander carries a sabre instead of a bugle, as do all other commanders. The Infantry and Artillery Bands perform together for halftime shows, but are often split for minor performances such as local parades and functions where the entire band is not needed. Furthermore, the band is composed of three different ROTC programs and appoints commanders to manage and train the cadets within their respective ROTC affiliations. On the field, the band is led by three drum majors and the twelve members of bugle rank. Each drum major carries a mace and directs the band based on its movements and whistle commands during a drill. The head drum major is a Cadet Lieutenant Colonel, while the two side drum majors, the Infantry Band Drum Major and the Artillery Band Drum Major, are Cadet Majors. Bugle rank consists of the Band Commander and eleven other senior cadets who are well respected in the band and have impeccable marching abilities. Each bugle rank member carries a bugle with a banner, which are never played during a performance. Together, the drum majors and bugle rank lead the band through the maneuvers on the field. In addition to their primary functions within the band, the bugles and maces also serve a military ceremonial function and are used to salute commissioned officers, much as a rifleman would salute with a rifle or a commander would salute with a sabre. =Composition= The band has over 400 members, though as of 2019, a typical performance fields slightly over 300 bandsmen.Performance figures based on recordings made by Texas A&M; Corps of Cadets Marketing Office and uploaded to the Corps of Cadets' official social media channels  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Un2uvS2sn6I Instrumentation consists of more than 60 trumpets, 40 trombones, 30 mellophones, 30 baritones, 25 bass horns, 40 drummers, and 90 assorted woodwinds, though the actual composition varies annually. There are no flutes in the Aggie Band, as their position while being played would hinder the intricate marching maneuvers. Piccolos are used instead. All members of the band must have high school marching experience, an audition during the spring semester leading into the first fall semester of attendance to include major scales and sight reading, and an individual interview with the band director. Prospective members are also encouraged to participate in the Spend the Night with the Corps program to better understand the rigors of life in the Corps of Cadets. Marching =Complex maneuvers= The Band finishes an oblique movement as they march past the Lone Star Showdown logo at the Darrell K. Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium. The repertoire of the Aggie Band's maneuvers is designed by the directors and drum majors and can include obliques, flanks, countermarches, and other Army marching maneuvers. The Band is generally led by the bugle rank with each person following the person in front of them, also known as follow- the-leader. Space between band members during countermarches is less than six inches (15 cm) and during other maneuvers even less. This space is insufficient for the bass horns and some members must turn their horns to complete the maneuver. According to an article in The Battalion, \\"some of the Aggie band's maneuvers are so complex that some drill-charting software says that the drills are impossible because they require multiple people to be in the same place at the same time.\\" This is also discussed in a video by The Association of Former Students of Texas A&M; University. The Fightin' Texas Aggie Band has performed at inauguration parades for many Presidents of the United States in Washington, D.C., including at the personal request of President-elect George H. W. Bush. Other events in which the band has participated include inauguration parades for Governors of Texas, major annual parades across the country, and the dedication ceremony for the George H. W. Bush Presidential Library. =Typical halftime drill= The Fightin' Texas Aggie Band's Bugle Rank leads the band at halftime at the 2007 Maroon and White football game. The halftime drill always begins with the band running into place at the command of the drum major's whistle. The announcer (Colonel Jay Brewer) then states, usually the crowd in unison with him says, \\"Ladies and gentlemen, now forming at the north end of Kyle Field, the nationally famous Fightin' Texas Aggie Band.\\"https://musa.tamu.edu/lt-col-jay-brewer/ added for rank clarification A whoop and cheers come from the audience. The drum majors then march out in front of the band and the head drum major calls the band to attention and vocally gives directions to the band, referencing the composition of the Aggie War Hymn, by shouting, \\"Recall! Step off on Hullabaloo!\\" (Recall is a traditional Army bugle call ‚Äì the first 34 notes, and intro of the Aggie War Hymn. \\"Hullabaloo\\" is the first word sung in the Aggie War Hymn.) These directions are not amplified in any way, but can be heard across the entire stadium. After another whoop, the drum majors signal for the horns to be lifted into playing position with two quick whistle blasts and the bugle rank does a flourish. The drill then begins with the band playing the opening notes of the War Hymn and stepping off into the initial formation. At some point in the drill, the band converts from Spread formation to Block formation. With no cessation of the music until the band leaves the field, the drill continues and often stops with the band playing the last stanza in place in the center of the field before moving into the signature \\"Block T\\" or \\"Block ATM\\". When done playing, the band runs off the field. Specific maneuvers in the drill can include: * The Criss Cross: the band files split into two halves and march through each other at 90¬∞ angles * The Four- way Cross: The band splits into four groups of three files and march through each other from each of the corners of the field (this maneuver is one of the more popular among fans, due to its difficulty) * Minstrel Turns: band members pass through each other by stepping between each other's feet. * Spread-to- Block: the band moves from being 30 files wide (i.e., across the width of the football field) by 12 ranks deep (i.e., along the length of the football field) to 12 files wide by 30 ranks deep * Block-to-Spread: the opposite of Spread-to-Block * Continuous Countermarch: the bugle rank leads two successive countermarches following the back of the band through the maneuver * Wheel Turns (also known as a Gate Turn): A turn of a block of the band where the people on the inside of the turn reduce their step size. This is only done during parades when going around corners. Music As a military marching band, the Aggie Band exclusively plays traditional marches. Among many other marches, its primary repertoire includes: * Fightin' Texas Aggie War Hymn Bandsmen serving as Officers of the Day at Bryant-Denny Stadium * Spirit of Aggieland: The school's alma mater * The Noble Men of Kyle: The group's signature march; also a nickname for the band * Ballad of the Green Berets * The main theme from the movie Patton * When Johnny Comes Marching Home * Strategic Air Command March The Aggie Band frequently performs a number of standard military and circus marches: * The Trombone King * Stars and Stripes Forever * Bravura * National Emblem * Them Basses * Washington Post * Armed Forces Medley * St. Julien March * Semper Fidelis * Americans We * English March * Pentland Hills Many contemporary works are also commonly played by the band, several of them arranged by Dr. Rhea. These include movie marches (Theme from 1941, Parade of the Charioteers), concert marches (The Sinfonians), and even symphonic and orchestral music (\\"Cathedral Chorus\\" from Russian Christmas Music, Great Gate of Kiev).

He was Podstoli of the Crown from 1669, Court Marshal of the Crown from 1673, Grand Marshal of the Crown from 1676 and starost of Spisz. Lubomirski fought in wars against Sweden and Hungary. He participated with his father in the siege of Toru≈Ñ in 1658. He refused to join the rokosz of his father and try to mediate between the rokoszans and the king. He was a proponent of the vivente rege elections and supporter of the politics of queen Ludwika Maria. He performed numerous diplomatic missions to France, Italy and Spain. He was against the abdication of king Jan II Kazimierz in 1668. From 1667 he was frequently deputy for the Sejm. Owing to his experience and authority, the Sejm session in 1670 was not broken like the two sessions before, which were aborted by a veto. During the interregnum in 1673-1674 he supported the candidature of his friend, Jan Sobieski for the Polish throne. In contrast to his father, he was free of private ambitions and always acted according to the interests of the Republic. He was variously talented. He became famous outside of Poland as the author of literary and scientific works. He wrote poems, plays and philosophical, religious and historical tracts. He was the founder and benefactor of schools and churches. As Sejm Marshal he led the Election Sejm from 2 May to 19 June 1669 and the ordinary Sejm from 9 September to 31 October 1670 in Warsaw.

The river source is located in the Central Panay Mountain Range on Mount Baloy in the western portion of Capiz in the vicinity of Tapaz, travelling northwards to the mountainous western portion of Jamindan, then northeastward to the town of Libacao in Aklan province. The river traverses the municipalities of Madalag, Malinao, Banga, Lezo, Numancia, and Kalibo before emptying to its mouth into Sibuyan Sea. The name of the river is where the term Aklan came from, and is derived from the word akae, which means to boil or to froth. Because of the swiftness of the river current, the water of the Aklan river seems to boil or froth. Akean therefore means \\"where there is boiling or frothing\\".

When the Spanish conquistadores executed the last ruler of the Inca people, Atahualpa, he vowed (according to the legend) that he would come back one day to avenge his death. According to the legend, the Spaniards buried his body parts in several places around the kingdom: His head is said to rest under the Presidential Palace in Lima, while his arms are said to be under the Waqaypata (Square of tears) in Cuzco and his legs in Ayacucho. Buried under the earth he will grow until one day, when he will rise, take back his kingdom and restore harmony in the relationship between Pachamama (the earth) and her children. Since it has been passed on orally for many generations, several different versions of the Inkarri myth exist. The name Inkarri probably evolved from the Spanish Inca-rey (Inca-king).

The total area of its more than 50 islands is 36 km¬≤. The largest island is also called Valaam. Other known islands are: Skitsky (second by size), Lembos, Sviatoy, Bayonny, Moskovsky, Predtechensky, Nikonovsky, Divny, Emelyanov, Oboronny, Goly, Savvaty's, Zosima's, Skalisty, Lukovy, Ovsiany, Rzhanoi, Nikolsky. It is best known as the site of the 14th century Valaam Monastery on Valaam Island and for its natural environment.Selby p. 175 In the 12th century, the islands were a part of the Novgorod Republic. In the 17th century, they were captured by Sweden during the Time of Troubles, but Russia reconquered them less than a century later. When the Grand Duchy of Finland was set up in the early 19th century as an autonomous part of the Russian Empire, Alexander I of Russia made Valaam a part of Finland. In 1917, Valaam became a part of newly independent Finland, but it was annexed by the USSR after the Winter War and Continuation War. The name of the island is from the Finno-Ugric word valamo, which means the high, mountain, ground. The climate and natural history of the island are unique because of its position in Lake Ladoga. Spring begins at the end of March and a typical summer on Valaam consists of 30-35 sunny days, which is more than on the mainland. The average temperature in July is 17¬∞C (63¬∞F). The winter and snow arrive in early December. In the middle of February the ice road to the nearest city of Sortavala (42 km, 15 mi) is traversable. The average temperature of February is minus 8¬∞C (18¬∞F). More than 480 species of plants grow on the island, many of which have been cultivated by monks. The island is covered by coniferous woods, about 65% of which are pine. Ten species of mammals and more than 120 avian species call the archipelago home. The island was visited repeatedly by emperors Alexander I, Alexander II, and other members of the imperial family. Other famous visitors include Tchaikovsky and Mendeleyev. The island is permanently inhabited by monks and families. In 1999, there were about 600 residents on the main island; including army service personnel, restoration workers, guides and monks. There is a kindergarten, an arts and sports venue, a school, a small museum and a medical centre. The community on Valaam at the moment has no official administrative status. During the summer, the main island can be reached by tour boats which leave St. Petersburg at night and arrive at the island the following morning. The president of the Russian Federation has a dacha on one of the islands of Valaam, but its precise location is not publicly known.

Population: History Strelna was first mentioned in Cadastral surveying of Vodskaya pyatina in 1500, as the village of Strelna on Retse Strelne on the Sea in the churchyard Kipen Koporsky County. After Treaty of Stolbovo these lands were part of Sweden, and in 1630 in Strelna appears as a baronial estate of Swedish politician Johan Skytte. The estate had a marina, a water mill, a pond, a greenhouse and a small house church. Palace of Peter the Great Formerly a Swedish chancellor's estate, Strelna was chosen by Peter the Great as a place for his future summer house in 1714. Jean Baptiste Le Blond, famous for his work with Andr√© Le N√¥tre at Versailles, was commissioned to prepare designs for a palace and park. Le Blond envisaged the palace as a Ch√¢teau d'Eau, situated on a round island. The gardens were laid out to Le Blond's design, but the master's death prevented him from completing a more elaborate project for the palace. In 1718, a temporary wooden palace was constructed in Strelna. It had been used by the Russian royalty as a sort of hunting lodge, and has been faithfully preserved to this day. After Le Blond's death, the commission to build the grand palace passed to Niccolo Michetti, a disciple of the Roman Carlo Fontana. A cornerstone was laid in June 1720, but next year it became apparent that the place was ill-adapted for installation of fountains, thus Peter decided to concentrate his attention on the nearby Peterhof. Disappointed, Michetti left Russia, and all works in Strelna were suspended. On ascending the throne in 1741, Peter's daughter Elizabeth intended to complete her father's project. Her favourite architect Bartolomeo Rastrelli was asked to expand and aggrandize Michetti's design. But Rastrelli's attention was soon diverted to other palaces, in Peterhof and Tsarskoye Selo, so the Strelna palace stood unfinished until the end of the century. Leib Guard reception at the Konstantin Palace. A 19th-century painting. Family home of the Konstantinovichi branch of the Romanovs  In 1797, Strelna was granted to Grand Duke Konstantin Pavlovich (second son of Paul I) and his wife Grand Duchess Anna Feodorovna (aunt of Queen Victoria). Despite a great fire in 1803, the Konstantin Palace was completed by 1807. Andrei Voronikhin and Luigi Rusca were held responsible for architecture of its upper storeys. After Konstantin's death, the palace passed to his nephew, and the Konstantinovichi branch of the Romanov dynasty retained its ownership until the Revolution. Vicissitudes in the 20th and 21st century The Konstantin Palace after renovation during the 300th anniversary of Saint Petersburg After 1917 the palace fell into decay: it was handed over to a child labour commune, then to a secondary school. For a period during World War II, the Germans occupied Strelna and had a naval base there. Some Decima Flottiglia MAS men and attack boats were brought from Italy and based at Strelna along with German Army boats. Strelna Raid: Soviet commando frogmen attacked that base and destroyed 2 German army boats on 5 October 1943. After the ravages of German occupation, only the palace walls were left standing; all interior decoration was gone. No effective restoration had been undertaken until 2001 when Vladimir Putin ordered the palace to be converted into a presidential residence for Saint Petersburg. The park with canals, fountains, and drawbridges was then recreated to Le Blond's original designs, complete with a water-bound pavilion by the sea shore. In front of the palace is the equestrian statue of Peter the Great, originally installed in 1911 in Riga, while Mikhail Shemyakin's modernist sculpture of Peter's family strolling through the garden may be found closer to the sea shore. Several rooms in the restored palace are dedicated to the poet Konstantin Romanov (who was born there). CIS Summit, June 2008 In preparation for the celebration of the 300th anniversary of the founding Saint Petersburg, the Russian government decided to restore the palace and its grounds as a state conference center and presidential residence. The renovated Konstantin Palace hosted more than 50 heads of state during the Saint Petersburg tercentenary celebrations in 2003. Three years later, in July 2006 (July 15‚Äì17), it hosted the 32nd G8 summit. During these summits, the world leaders were accommodated in 18 luxurious cottages by the sea-side. Each of the cottages is named after a historic Russian town. The early 19th-century stables were reconstructed into a four-star hotel for other visitors. The 2013 G20 summit was held at the palace 5‚Äì6 September 2013. The palace also held the qualifying draw for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, which took place in Russia. Other landmarks Several other Romanov residences may be seen in the vicinity of the Konstantin Palace. The baroque Znamenka, designed by Rastrelli, used to be a home to the Nikolaevichi branch of the Romanovs. The neoclassical Mikhailovka palace once belonged to the Mikhailovichi branch of the family. Other landmarks in Strelna include a dacha of Mathilde Kschessinska and the ruined Maritime Monastery of St. Sergius, with numerous churches by Luigi Rusca. The monastery is noted as a burial place of the Zubov brothers and other Russian nobles. The imperial chancellor Alexander Gorchakov was interred here in 1883. The Konstantin Palace, the Trinity Monastery, Mikhailovka, and Znamenka are parts of the World Heritage Site Saint Petersburg and Related Groups of Monuments.

June 12th 2018. it is the second largest town in the Vogtlandkreis after Plauen. It lies by the A72 between Plauen (at c. 18 km) and Zwickau (at c. 19 km). History Reichenbach im Vogtland originated as a settlement of the Franks and thanks its early growth to its convenient position in a valley near Mylau Castle. In 1212 it was officially named Richenbach, possibly because of the many wetland basins (German: B√§chen) in the area which now hosts the Altstadt. It received town privileges around 1240 and was mentioned in 1271 in a decree as \\"civitatis richenbach\\", a recognized small city with autonomous rights to defend itself, trade and hold municipal elections. Much of the Reichenbach history was lost in the city fires of 1720, 1773, and 1833. The foundations of the Peter Paul parish church still date back to the 12th century. The rise of industrialisation allowed the city to grow further, again promoted by its accessibility. Sewing and weaving were Reichenbach's main trades, but in the 19th century the metal working industry settled in the city and in the early 20th century, there was a rise of the pulp and paper industry and printing works. Some of Reichenbach's most remarkable structures date from this era, including its Rathaus (1837‚Äì1839), the railway station (1846), and world's largest brick bridge, the G√∂ltzsch Viaduct (1846‚Äì1851). Reichenbach im Vogtland has had a rather insignificant role in World War II. On March 21, 1945, American bombings killed 161 citizens and destroyed or damaged many buildings.Excerpt from Reichenbach im Vogtland of the Reichenbach Seniors Computer Club. Against the orders of the National Socialists, Mayor Dr. Otto Schreiber capitulated the city on April 17 without a fight. The town was occupied by American troops, who handed over control to the Red Army on July 1. About 120 innocent youth aged 15 and 16 were taken in custody and transferred to the Soviet Union's secret service (predecessor of the KGB), hoping all other citizens would be spared. After Germany was split up, Reichenbach im Vogtland became part of East Germany. The population has since declined from nearly 35,000 to little over 20,000 today. As was the case with many former East German industrial cities, the 1991 German reunification caused many workers to lose their jobs and they started to move away. Many initiatives have since been deployed to rebuild the local economy. There are still many industrial buildings in Reichenbach with a high historic value, but with little appeal. The administrative district of Reichenbach has grown since the early 20th century to include the quarters and villages of Brunn (1994), Cunsdorf (1924), Friesen (1994), Mylau (2016), Obermylau (2016), Oberreichenbach (1908), Rotschau (1996), and Schneidenbach (1999), and has had a collaborative relationship with Heinsdorfergrund since 2000.Gemeinden 1994 und ihre Ver√§nderungen seit 01.01.1948 in den neuen L√§ndern, Verlag Metzler- Poeschel, Stuttgart, 1995, , Herausgeber: Statistisches BundesamtStBA: √Ñnderungen bei den Gemeinden Deutschlands, siehe 1996 Schneidenbach kam am 1.

Currently, there is no officially-recognized orthography for the language so different writers may follow different writing conventions. With the implementation of the Department of Education's Mother Tongue-Based Multilingual Education (MTB-MLE) starting school year 2012-2013, there emerged a need for orthographic guidelines for the various \\"mother tongues\\" to be used in the early years of education. For Masbate√±o, Rosero and Balbuena (2016) prepared the draft working orthography developed during the first orthography congress held from July 15‚Äì16, 2016. This working orthography, however, is not meant as a final guide and is open to revisions. In the working orthography, the following are the basic alphabet used: Aa, Bb, Dd, Gg, Hh, Ii, Kk, Ll, Mm, Nn, NGng, Pp, Rr, Ss, Tt, Uu, Ww, and Yy. The letters Cc, Ff, Jj, √ë√±, Qq, Vv, Xx, and Zz may be used in unassimilated loanwords and proper nouns. Ee and Oo are considered to be variants of Ii and Uu and are used according to certain rules. Generally, \\"U\\" shall be used in representing /u/ except if there is only one /u/ in a word which occurs in the final position (e.g. pito, lisod). If there is more than one /u/ sound, \\"o\\" shall used at the final position of a word (e.g. gu\`√≥l, pumuluyo\`). In assimilated loanwords, \\"O\\" is used etymologically (e.g. \\"ospital\\" from Spanish \\"hospital\\", \\"oro\\" from Spanish). The rules on the usage of \\"E\\" and \\"I\\" follow a similar principle. In general, \\"I\\" shall be used to represent /i/ but borrowed words originally having an /e/ sound shall be spelled with an \\"E\\" (e.g. ahente, karne). In representing the glides of /u/ and /w/, and /i/ and /y/, the vowels are dropped and w and y are used (e.g. pwede instead of puwede, sya instead of siya, kwento instead of kuwento). In addititon, the grave accent (\`) is used for the glottal stop and is also considered as part of the alphabet of the working orthography. This symbol may be used between a consonant and vowel (e.g. pus\`on, bag\`o), in the final position of words (e.g. t√∫ro\`, pak√≥\`), between two vowels (e.g ti\`il, di\`in) and at the onset of a syllable beginning with a vowel (e.g \`adlaw, \`ako). In indicating stress, the acute accent (¬¥) is used above the vowel of a stressed syllable. Stress is indicated if it falls on the last syllabe (e.g. hub√°g) but not when it falls on the penultimate syllable (kiray). It is possible that two stress accents be used in one word (e.g h√°mab√°w, \`√°mam√°knit). A hyphen is used in, among others, words with full reduplication (e.g. tawo-tawo, balay-balay), compound words (e.g. tagum-mata), affixation of proper nouns (e.g. \\"pa-LBC\\", \\"pa-Manila\\"), time expression (\\"alas-dose\\"), and expressions derived from Spanish using the \\"de\\" affix (e.g. \\"de-kalidad\\"). The hyphen is not used in words with partial reduplication (e.g. burubaruto, not buru-baruto), affixation of native root words (e.g. ginaka\`on, not gina-kaun), affixation of borrowed verbs and nouns (e.g. magtext, not mag-text) and in linkers (e.g. duha ka bilog, not duha ka-bilog).

Upon reaching the peak, the train is then propelled from the peak by gravity and is usually allowed to coast throughout the rest of the roller coaster ride's circuit on its own momentum, including most or all of the remaining uphill sections. The initial upward-sloping section of a roller coaster track is usually a lift hill, as the train typically begins a ride with little speed, though some coasters have raised stations that permit an initial drop without a lift hill. Although uncommon, some tracks also contain multiple lift hills. Lift hills usually propel the train to the top of the ride via one of two methods: a chain lift involving a long, continuous chain which trains hook on to and are carried to the top; or a drive tire system in which multiple motorized tires (known as friction wheels) push the train upwards. A typical chain lift consists of a heavy piece of metal called a chain dog, which is mounted onto the underside of one of the cars which make up the train. This is in place to line up with the chain on the lift hill. The chain travels through a steel trough, and is normally powered by one or more motors which are positioned under the lift hill. Chain dogs underneath each train are engaged by the chain and the train is pulled up the lift. Anti-rollback dogs engage a rack (ratcheted track) alongside the chain to prevent the train from descending the lift hill. At the crest of the lift, the chain wraps around a gear wheel where it begins its return to the bottom of the lift; the train is continually pulled along until gravity takes over and it accelerates downhill. The spring-loaded chain and anti-rollback dogs will disengage themselves as this occurs. Cable lift The cable lift tensioning mechanism on Millennium Force at Cedar Point The cable lift is a type of lift mechanism that was first used on Millennium Force at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio. This type of lift has also been used for Kings Dominion's Intimidator 305, Holiday Park's Expedition GeForce, Walibi Holland's Goliath, Djurs Sommerland's Piraten (Europe's only \\"Mega-Lite\\"-model coaster by Intamin), Tokyo Dome City's Thunder Dolphin, Hersheypark's Skyrush, Flying Aces at Ferrari World and Altair at Cinecitt√† World. Currently, there are only two wooden roller coasters that utilize a cable lift hill: El Toro at Six Flags Great Adventure and T Express at Everland. The cable lift utilizes a cable loop in place of the traditional chain, which is attached to a short section of chain that engages the trains chain dog. Because a cable is much lighter than a chain, cable lifts are much faster than chain lifts and can be used on much steeper hills - even vertical. A cable also requires far less maintenance than a chain. Another advantage to park guests is that a cable lift is very quiet, partly because the main drive winch is located directly beneath the top of the lift, a location which will normally be relatively far from guest-accessible areas. Despite having several advantages over a chain lift, it has a significant disadvantage, which is that it must return to the bottom of the lift hill after lifting each train (in contrast to a continuously moving chain lift which does not need any kind of resetting). This limits the usefulness of the cable lift in applications where the cable must travel a long distance and the interval between train departures is short. Ferris wheel lift The Ferris wheel lift is a type of lift based on the rotating circular design of a ferris wheel. Created by Premier Rides, it exists on 'Round About' (formerly Maximum RPM) which operated at Freestyle Music Park in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina prior to being dismantled and moved to a park in Vietnam. It uses a Ferris Wheel like motion to lift the cars to the top, as on a Ferris Wheel. The cars are then released onto the track. Elevator lift The elevator lift is a new technology used to make the ascension of the roller coaster faster and more comfortable due to the fact all riders are doing is moving vertically up. It is used mostly in indoor rollercoasters like Scooby-Doo Spooky Coaster. The most notable coaster to use this lift system (and the second purposely- built roller coaster in the United States to be built with it) is Cobra's Curse at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay.  Friction Wheels lift  A friction wheel lift is a type of lift mechanism where either 2 wheels are placed in a horizontal position, or on a vertical position. These are commonly used for brake runs, lifts, storage and more. The train has a small vertical lip, where the two friction wheels meet at each side. Then, the wheels pull the train up slowly, while making a jet-like noise. A anti-rollback system is not needed as the wheels are tight against the lip. Tilt lift/thrill lift section A tilt lift is a new way to elevate coasters. The tilt lift is essentially an elevator lift, but the elevator lift rotates 90 degrees so that the train is now vertical, with the nose of the train facing the ground. This design has not been made yet; the only places where this occurs are in the video games RollerCoaster Tycoon 3, Thrillville Off the Rails and Coaster Crazy. However, there are coaster designs that use the tilting aspect of this lift already. The first operating tilt coaster in the world is Gravity Max at Lihpao Land in Taiwan. The coaster was built by Vekoma. In this coaster, after going up a chain hill, the train is held on a horizontal section of track, which then tilts forwards, to become a vertical section, which then leads into a vertical drop accelerated by gravity. The Chinese company Golden Horse has made several unofficial recreations, each featuring a less than vertical drop and significantly different track elements. Anti-rollback device Diagram depicting the anti-rollback safety feature The familiar \\"click-clack\\" sound that occurs as a roller coaster train ascends the lift hill is not caused by the chain itself. The cause for this noise is actually a safety device used on lift hills‚Äîthe anti-rollback device. The anti-rollback device is a standard safety feature, typically consisting of a continuous, saw-toothed, section of metal, forming a linear ratchet. Roller coaster trains are fitted with anti- rollback \\"dogs\\" which are essentially heavy-duty pieces of metal which fall and rest in each groove of the anti-rollback device on the track as the trains ascend the lift-hill. This makes the \\"clicking\\" sound and allows the train to go upwards only, effectively preventing the train from rolling back down the hill should it ever encounter a power failure or broken chain. This feature was derived from the similar feature originally used on the Mauch Chunk Switchback Railway in Pennsylvania, starting in 1846. The two uphill planes that cars were drawn up under the power of a stationary steam engine had two slightly different early forms of this anti-rollback device. The entire concept of the modern roller coaster was also initially inspired by this railroad.

The film's storyline concerns the first interplanetary flight to the planet Mars, manned by a crew of five, and launched from Earth orbit near \\"The Wheel\\", mankind's first space station. On their long journey to the Red Planet, they encounter various dangers, both from within and without, that nearly destroy the mission. Plot Mankind has achieved space flight capability and built \\"The Wheel\\" space station in orbit above Earth. It is commanded by its designer, Colonel Samuel T. Merritt. His son, Captain Barney Merritt, having been aboard for a year, wants to return to Earth. A giant spaceship has been built in a nearby orbit, and an Earth inspector arrives aboard the station with new orders: Merritt Sr. is being promoted to general and will command the new spaceship, now being sent to Mars instead of the Moon. As General Merritt considers his crew of three enlisted men and one officer, his close friend, Sgt. Mahoney volunteers. The general turns him down for being 20 years too old. Hearing that Mars is the new destination, Barney Merritt volunteers to be the second officer. Right after the crew watches a TV broadcast from their family and friends, the mission blasts off for the Red Planet. The general's undiagnosed and growing space fatigue is beginning to seriously affect his judgement: reading his Bible frequently, he has doubts about the righteousness of the mission. After launch, Sgt. Mahoney is discovered to be a stowaway, having hidden in a crew spacesuit. Their piloting radar antenna later fails, and two crewmen go outside to make repairs. They manage to get it working just as their monitors show a glowing planetoid, 20 times larger than their spaceship, coming at them from astern. The general fires the engines, barely managing to avoid a collision, but the planetoid's fast-orbiting debris punctures Sgt. Fodor's spacesuit, killing him instantly. After a religious service in space, Fodor's body is cast adrift into the void. Eight months later, the general is becoming increasingly mentally unbalanced, focusing on Sgt. Fodor's loss as \\"God's judgement\\". On the Mars landing approach, he attempts to crash their spaceship, now convinced the mission violates the laws of God. Barney wrests control away from his father, landing the large flying wing glider-rocket safely. Later, as the crew takes their first steps on the Red Planet, they look up and see water pouring down from the now vertical return rocket. Barney quickly discovers the leak is sabotage caused by his father, who threatens his son with a .45 automatic. The two struggle and the pistol discharges, killing the general. Sgt. Mahoney, who observed only the last stages of the struggle, wants Barney confined under arrest with the threat of court martial, but cooler heads prevail; Barney becomes the ranking officer. Mars proves to be inhospitable, and they struggle to survive with their decreased water supply. Earth's correct orbital position for a return trip is one year away. While glumly celebrating their first Christmas on Mars, a sudden snowstorm blows in, allowing them to replenish their water supply. As their launch window arrives, they hear low rumbling sounds, then see rocks falling, and feel the ground shake violently. The ground level shifts during this violent marsquake. Their spaceship is now leaning at a precarious angle and cannot make an emergency blast off. To right the spaceship, the crew uses the rocket engines' powerful thrust to shift the ground under the landing legs. The attempt works and they blast off, the spaceship rising just as the Martian surface completely collapses. Once in space, Barney and Mahoney reconcile. Impressed with Barney's heroism and leadership while on Mars, Mahoney concludes that pursuing Barney's court martial for his father's death would only impugn the general's reputation, tarnishing what previously had been a spotless military career. Better is the fiction that \\"the man who conquered space\\" died in the line of duty, sacrificing himself to save his crew. Cast Production The science and technology portrayed in Conquest of Space were intended to be as realistic as possible in depicting the first voyage to Mars. The film's theatrical release poster tagline reads: \\"See how it will happen ... in your lifetime!\\" The title Conquest of Space is from the 1949 nonfiction book The Conquest of Space, written by Willy Ley and illustrated by Chesley Bonestell. George Pal bought the book's film rights at the suggestion of Ley.Hickman 1977 p. 87 Bonestell, noted for his photorealistic paintings showing views from outer space, worked on the film's space matte paintings. The production design of Conquest of Space was closely modeled on the technical concepts of Wernher von Braun and Bonestell's space paintings, which originally appeared in Collier's magazine and were reprinted in the 1952 Viking Press book Across the Space Frontier, edited by Cornelius Ryan.Miller 2016, pp. 60-69. The film also incorporated concepts from von Braun's 1952 book The Mars Project, as well as material appearing in the April 30, 1954, issue of Collier's magazine, \\"Can we get to Mars?\\" by von Braun, with Cornelius Ryan. This would later be incorporated into the 1956 Viking Press book The Exploration of Mars by Willy Ley, Wernher von Braun, and Chesley Bonestell.Miller 2016, pp. 60-69. All of these books mainly feature text that is straight popular science, with no fictional characters or story line. In addition, according to director Byron Haskin, \\"We had Wernher von Braun on the set all the time...as a technical advisor\\".Haskin, Byron. Byron Haskin: An Interview by Joe Adamson. Metuchen, New Jersey: The Directors Guild of America and Scarecrow Press, 1984, p. 230. Had George Pal followed any or all of these nonfiction books as written, he would have produced a speculative futuristic documentary, much like of the trio of 1955 Tomorrowland-set (Walt Disney's) Disneyland television episodes: Man in Space, Man and the Moon, and Mars and Beyond. The final screenplay by James O'Hanlon, from an adaptation by Philip Yordan, Barr√© Lyndon, and George Worthing Yates, instead creates a fictional story from whole cloth.Warren 1982 pp. 208-214 Reception =Critical response upon release= Judgments on the quality of the film's special effects have varied. Upon the film's release, reviewer Oscar A. Godbout in his review for The New York Times praised the effects, but was disparaging of the storyline, noting \\"... as plots go...it is not offensive\\".Goodbout, Oscar A. (O.A.G.). \\"Special Effects Show: 'Conquest of Space'.\\" The New York Times, May 28, 1955. =Later critiques= Film authority Roy Kinnard says, ‚ÄúIn examining the plethora of 1950s science- fiction movies which deal with the theme of mans‚Äô journeying to other worlds in order to advance his own knowledge, George Pal‚Äôs production of Conquest of Space stands head and shoulders above the others....

[T]he special visual effects in Conquest ... are outstanding for their time ... and they are the well-tailored work of one of Hollywood‚Äôs most gifted craftsmen, John P. Fulton. Besides the massive, graceful spacecraft shown in this film, it was Fulton who was responsible for parting the Red Sea in the 1956 version of The Ten Commandments. ... It is true that the blue screen mattes in Conquest are crude [from our perspective] ... but this is hardly a technical flaw unique to this picture.

Chicago: Blake Publishing Corp., June 1979 Furthermore, science fiction film authority Thomas Kent Miller states, \\"Blue screen was used extensively in this epic [The Ten Commandments], and the blue line fringes are always quite evident throughout the movie. In fact, Fulton‚Äôs remarkable and iconic Parting of the Red Sea sequence is a great hodgepodge of intersecting blue fringe lines\\".Miller 2016, p. 67. British film critic John Baxter, in his 1970 volume, Science Fiction in the Cinema, states, ‚ÄúConquest of Space ... gave [George] Pal and [Byron] Haskin an excuse to show realistic take-offs, space maneuverings, and a landing on Mars ... achieved with some flair. Drama in the shape of a religious maniac at the helm detracts little from the essential narrative, and some of the detail is clever, such as the space burial with the suited corpse sliding slowly on a long fall into the sun\\".Baxter, John. Science Fiction in the Cinema. New York: A. S. Barnes, 1970. Modern audiences are apt to notice the presence of matte lines.

History and profile After the Society was founded in 1929, the magazine was established the next year in May 1930 under the name Canadian Geographical Journal. The Society's objective was to produce a popular magazine primarily focusing on Canadian geography. The first editor was Charles Camsell, since 1915 a fellow of the British Royal Geographical Society, as well as a geologist who had been responsible for mapping large parts of Northern Ontario, Manitoba and the Yukon. Originally published out of Montreal, Quebec, the magazine is now headquartered in Ottawa, Ontario. The magazine adopted its current title in 1978. Typically the magazine contains articles on physical, historical, political and environmental geography, illustrated with photographs, illustrations and maps. Controversial subjects such as acid rain, clear-cut logging, vanishing wetlands, the pollution of the Great Lakes and energy sources of Canadians have also been covered in print and online. The magazine's website contains substantial extracts from current articles and supplementary information not published in the print edition, and a digital edition is also produced for each issue. In addition to the Canadian Geographic title, the RCGS also publishes G√©ographica, its French companion, and Canadian Geographic Travel, which concentrates on travel topics. Canadian Environment Awards In 2002, the magazine established the Canadian Environment Awards program in partnership with the government and private companies. This award was replaced by the 3M Environmental Innovation Award in 2009. Controversy In 2015, the magazine was criticized for allowing its editorial policy to be influenced by its sponsors. In a 2012 issue about the Calgary Stampede, journalist Jesse Brown wrote about improper treatment of horses by the Stampede. The article he filed was later edited to remove any reference to \\"horse culls\\". The magazine also distributed free educational resource material to schools across the country that discussed the Alberta Oil Sands. While Canadian Geographic maintained that the material was independent of influence, it was later revealed that some of the content came from the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, an industrial lobby group. In March 2018, in light of the American magazine, National Geographic, performing a public mea culpa for its history of racist depictions through the magazine's history, the editorship of Canadian Geographic publicly announced that it would be performing a similar historical review of its published content to see if it has had similar problems.

These are sometimes referred to as boomerang roller coasters, due to the ubiquity of Vekoma's Boomerang coaster model.  Early history  The first shuttle coasters were in fact the first roller coasters ever built. Inspired by the so-called \\"Russian Mountains,\\" these wheeled cars built on tracks found popularity in the early 19th century in Paris. In 1884, Switchback Railway opened at Coney Island, and consisted of a car that traveled on two tracks between two towers. It was the first roller coaster designed as an amusement ride in America. The next shuttle roller coaster to be built was Backety-Back Scenic Railway, built in 1909.  First launched shuttle coasters  Greezed Lightnin' at Kentucky Kingdom The first two launched shuttle coaster designs were introduced in 1977 by competitors Arrow Development and Anton Schwarzkopf. Arrow built and opened three that year including Black Widow (now defunct) at Six Flags New England, Screamin' Demon (also defunct) at Kings Island, and Zoomerang at Circus World (now located to Fun Spot Amusement Park & Zoo). Arrow's models used an electric motor to launch the train. Anton Schwarzkopf went with a different design using a dropped weight as a launch mechanism. This design was known as the Shuttle Loop. The first three built by that company were King Kobra at Kings Dominion (now located at Hopi Hari in Brazil), White Lightnin' at Carowinds (now located at Gold Reef City in South Africa), and Tidal Wave at California's Great America. Schwarzkopf later upgraded its launch mechanism to a flywheel design. The first two roller coasters based on this new design were both released in 1978 - Montezooma's Revenge at Knott's Berry Farm and Greezed Lightnin' at Six Flags AstroWorld, currently in storage in Plainview, Texas for Cliff's Amusement Park in New Mexico. The first flywheel launched roller coaster that opened in Europe was Turbine at Walibi Wavre in 1982.  Vekoma's Boomerang  In 1984 Vekoma debuted its Boomerang shuttle coaster, which features a lift hill rather than a launched train. In addition to the original Boomerang, Vekoma also designed the Invertigo and the Giant Inverted Boomerang. As of 2018, 55 Boomerangs and its variants are currently in operation around the world.  Linear motor launched shuttle coasters  In 1996 Premier Rides debuted the first coasters ever to use linear induction motors, and in 1997 opened Batman & Robin: The Chiller at Six Flags Great Adventure, a pair of dueling launched shuttle coasters. Intamin introduced its reverse freefall coaster in 1997. In these models, the train is accelerated out of the station along a long, level track using linear synchronous motors, rises straight up a vertical tower, then free falls back down to return to the station. Only two reverse freefall coasters were built: Tower of Terror II at Dreamworld, and Superman: Escape from Krypton at Six Flags Magic Mountain, both of which first broke the 300 foot and 400 foot barriers. Tower of Terror II, however, discontinued in 2019. In 1998, Intamin introduced its first impulse coaster, Linear Gale at LaQua in Japan, which featured inverted trains traversing two vertical towers. In 2000, Intamin introduced Superman Ultimate Escape with a spiral tower and one vertical tower. Intamin introduced Wicked Twister in 2002, a variation with two spiral towers. With each pass through the station the train accelerates faster and travels further up the towers.

It was a specialized type of bulletin board system that allowed all callers to send lines of text to each other in real-time, often operating at 300 baud. In some ways, it was a sociological forerunner to IRC, and was a cheap, local alternative to CompuServe chat, which was expensive and billed by the minute. At its peak, at least 35 major DDial systems existed across the United States, many of them in large cities. During the evening when telephone rates were low, the biggest DDial systems would link together using Telenet or PC Pursuit connections, forming regional chat networks. History Diversi- Dial was written by Bill Basham, a computer hobbyist who ran a company known as Diversified Software Research in Farmington Hills, Michigan. The software was written while he was a resident of Rockford, Illinois. Bill Basham ran a copy of the system himself in Rockford at the time. Kim Kirkpatrick, \\"Hubcap\\" also in Rockford, ran DDial#2 and a lot of early testing was done between Bill and Kim. Another early Rockford site was owned by Dale Wishop (GOD) named \\"Heaven and Hell - The World that GOD Rulz Over!\\". The phone company had to run miles of new cable just to accommodate the additional phone lines. When \\"Heaven and Hell\\" shutdown, Dale sold some of his 1200 baud Applecat modems to Scott and Terri Johnson (Megabucks and Spender), and DDial #12 ‚ÄúSpenderz Never Inn‚Äù stated up in its place, running on two Apple //e computers and 12 phone lines. All of Bill's software followed the same naming scheme as \\"Diversi-[something]\\". Organization Customers typically paid the local DDial owner a flat rate of about $5 to $20 per month. Open access to anonymous visitors (called nons, r0s JAMFs or m0es) was an effective hook to draw in paid registrations. Nons typically had a five-minute connect time limit unless they were \\"validated\\" by an assistant sysop, and were shut out of the system during peak usage hours. A typical DDial system ran on a small cluster of Apple II computers, with seven connections per computer. In 1989, a DDial-like clone, Synergy Teleconferencing System AKA STS was developed for the IBM PC, but by this time it was outpaced by alternatives like GEnie. By the mid-1990s, DDials had been bypassed by the Internet and IRC, although Chicago's God's Country, kept an incredibly loyal following between 1985‚Äì87 and 1989-1998. Many of its users are still close to this day. Many client software programs existed for BBS connections back then, but one in particular for C64 or Commodore64 was optimized just for DDial, call Eagleterm 6a. Written by Jungle Jim (Jj), aka Jim Sanders, and released as freeware and saw widespread use among Ddialers. EagleTerm6a took full advantage of Commodore 64 pulse dial modem technology, heavily optimized to find the max pulse speed of the user's local phone connection, and rapid fire re-dial back in to beat the other callers when reconnecting, easily beating the newer tone dial modems just coming to market. During peak times, the DDial system was jam packed with callers far exceeding the number of available lines, and a super fast dialer was a plus. Later versions of Eagleterm6a were protected against reverse engineering (not de-compilable using unBlitz.) Major DDials One DDial owner went on to become the founder and CEO of Honesty.com, the first web- based third-party Internet application corporation, focused on E-Commerce sites such as eBay, Amazon.com, and Yahoo! Auctions, by utilizing the knowledge gleaned from having run a social and community based computer system for a decade prior to initial popularity of the Web. Point Zer0 was the other long-term Chicago-area Ddial, along with Jokertown. Other Chicago-area Ddials of Note included Kaleidoscope, General Modem (DDial #13), Tangled Web, The Bunker (DDial #4), Cloud Nine (DDial #38), Black Magic and others. At one period of time, the Chicago area hosted over 10 DDial or clone systems, possibly due to its relative proximity to the Rockford origins of Basham's DD #1. ENTchat, an Internet-based DDial look-alike, was somewhat active in the mid- to late 1990s but also went offline. In 2006, The Late Night BBS went online, utilizing the original DDial software running on an Apple //e, but was accessible from the Internet via telnet. The system provided an authentic 1980s ddial experience, including the traditional 300 bit/s connection speed. Late Night BBS has since gone offline. As of 2012, there are only two known DDial stations in operation: * The Savage Frontier, DDial Station #28, has been modified to run under emulation and is therefore Internet accessible. This system served the Philadelphia metropolitan area in the 1980s and 1990s, at times under other names. * RMAC (aka Rover's Multiuser Active Conference), DDial Station #34, runs on original Apple IIe hardware with modems and has been constructed in an Internet-accessible manner. This system served the Dallas / Fort Worth metroplex in the late 1980s. Today, the system uses authentic DDial software with TASC/Paradise mods, and can be reached via telnet at rmac.d-dial.com. Retro-Dial, a Linux-based chat server with the look and feel of DDial, currently has multiple stations in operation which are usually linked with each other as well as The Savage Frontier. The home station for Retro-Dial can be reached via telnet at carriersync.com. In late June, 2013, several members of Rockford, IL area DDials held a spontaneous reunion online, connected to each other via RMAC DDial #34.

She was also the only niece of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, and the wife of the wealthiest man in Imperial Russia, Prince Felix Felixovich Yusupov, one of the men who murdered Grigori Rasputin, \\"holy healer\\" to her cousin, the hemophiliac Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich of Russia, in 1916. Early life Before her marriage on 22 February 1914, Irina, the eldest child and only daughter in a family of seven children, was considered one of the most eligible women in Imperial Russia. Her family had spent long periods living in the south of France beginning in about 1906 because of her father's political disagreements with the Tsar.Princess Irina with her parents and brothers as a teenager.Her father was also carrying on an affair with a woman in the south of France and often asked Xenia for a divorce, which she refused to grant him. Xenia enjoyed extramarital affairs as well. Irina's parents tried to hide their unhappy marriage from their seven children, and Irina, a shy and tongue- tied girl with deep blue eyes and dark hair, had a happy childhood. Irina was often called Ir√®ne, the French version of her name, or Irene, the English version. Her mother sometimes nicknamed her \\"Baby Rina.\\" The Romanovs, heavily influenced by the French and English, spoke French better than Russian and often used the foreign versions of their first names to refer to each other. Princess Irina with her parents and brothers Grand Duchess Tatiana, left, and Grand Duchess Olga, right, ca. 1909  Marriage  Her husband-to-be, Felix Yusupov, was a man from a very wealthy family who enjoyed dressing in women's clothing and had sexual relationships with both men and women, scandalizing society, but he was also genuinely religious and willing to help others even when his own financial circumstances were reduced. At one point, in a fit of enthusiasm, he planned to give all his riches to the poor in imitation of his mentor, Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna. \\"Felix's ideas are absolutely revolutionary,\\" a disapproving Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna once said. He was persuaded not to do so by his mother, Zenaida, who said he had a duty to marry and continue the family line because he was her only surviving son. The future murderer of Rasputin also had a horror of the bloodshed and violence of war. Felix, being bisexual, was not certain if he was \\"fit for marriage.\\" Still, he was drawn to Irina and her icon-like beauty when he first encountered her. \\"One day when I was out riding I met a very beautiful girl accompanied by an elderly lady. Our eyes met and she made such an impression on me that I reined in my horse to gaze at her as she walked on,\\" he wrote in his memoirs. One day in 1910, he was paid a visit by Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich and Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna and was happy to discover the girl he had seen on the riding trail was their only daughter, Irina. \\"This time I had plenty of time to admire the wondrous beauty of the girl who was eventually to become my wife and lifelong companion. She had beautiful features, clear-cut as a cameo, and looked very like her father.\\" He renewed his acquaintance with Irina in 1913 and was even more drawn to her. \\"She was very shy and reserved, which added a certain mystery to her charm.... Little by little, Irina became less timid. At first her eyes were more eloquent than her conversation but, as she became more expansive, I learned to admire the keenness of her intelligence and her sound judgment. I concealed nothing in my past life from her, and, far from being perturbed by what I told her, she showed great tolerance and comprehension.\\" Yusupov wrote that Irina, perhaps because she had grown up with so many brothers, showed none of the artifice or lack of honesty that had put him off relations with other women. Although Irina was understanding about Yusupov's wild past, her parents were not. When her parents and maternal grandmother Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna heard the rumours about Felix, they wanted to call off the wedding. Most of the stories that they heard had originated from Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia, Irina's first cousin once removed, who had been one of Felix's friends and, it has been speculated, might have been involved in a romantic relationship with Felix. Dmitri told Felix he was also interested in marrying Irina, but Irina said she preferred Felix. Felix was able to persuade Irina's reluctant family to relent and allow the ceremony to go forward. However, neither he nor Irina appeared to have objected to the morganatic terms of the marriage: \\"All members of the dynasty who married someone not of royal blood were obliged to sign a document renouncing their rights to the throne. Although Irina was very distant in the line of succession, she had to comply with this regulation before marrying me; but it did not seem to worry her very much.\\" It was the society wedding of the year and the last such occasion in Russian society before World War I. Irina wore a 20th-century dress rather than the traditional court dress in which other Romanov brides had married, as she was a princess of the Imperial House, not a Grand Duchess. She wore a diamond and rock-crystal tiara that had been commissioned from Cartier and a lace veil that had belonged to Marie Antoinette. Guests at the wedding commented on what an attractive couple Felix and Irina made: \\"What an amazing couple‚Äìthey were so attractive. What bearing! What breeding!\\" said one guest. Irina was given away by her uncle, Nicholas II, and his wedding present to her was a bag of 29 uncut diamonds, ranging from three to seven carats. Irina and Felix also received a large assortment of precious gems from other wedding guests. They later managed to take many of these gems out of the country following the Russian Revolution of 1917 to use them to provide a living in exile. World War I Princess Irina of Russia and her husband, Prince Felix Yusupov The Yusupovs were on their honeymoon in Europe and the Middle East when World War I broke out. They were briefly detained in Berlin after the outbreak of hostilities. Irina asked her first cousin, Crown Princess Cecilie of Prussia to intervene with her father-in-law, Kaiser Wilhelm II, who refused to permit them to leave, but offered them a choice of three country estates to live in for the duration of the war. Felix's father appealed to the Spanish ambassador and won permission for them to return to Russia via neutral Denmark to Finland and from there to Petrograd. Felix converted a wing of his Moika Palace into a hospital for wounded soldiers but avoided entering military service himself by taking advantage of a law exempting only-sons from serving in the war. He entered the Cadet Corps and took an officer's training course but had no intention of joining a regiment. Irina's first cousin, Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna, to whom she had been close when they were girls, was disdainful of Felix: \\"Felix is a 'downright civilian,' dressed all in brown, walked to and fro about the room, searching in some bookcases with magazines and virtually doing nothing; an utterly unpleasant impression he makes‚Äîa man idling in such times,\\" Olga wrote to her father, Tsar Nicholas II, on 5 March 1915 after paying a visit to the Yusupovs. Felix and Irina's only daughter, Princess Irina Felixovna Yusupova, nicknamed \\"Beb√©\\", was born on 21 March 1915. \\"I shall never forget my happiness when I heard the child's first cry,\\" her father wrote. Irina liked her name and wanted to pass it on to her first child. Her mother Xenia was so worried over the delivery that Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna said it was almost like Xenia was giving birth instead of Irina. Killing of Rasputin Felix and Irina with their daughter in 1916 Both Felix and Irina were aware of salacious rumors regarding Rasputin and his association with the worsening political situation that brought rioting, protests and violence. Yusupov and his co-conspirators, Vladimir Purishkevich and Dmitri Pavlovich, decided that Rasputin was destroying the country and must be killed. Felix started paying visits to Rasputin in an attempt to gain his trust. It has been speculated that Felix told the healer that he needed assistance to overcome his homosexual impulses and enjoy a satisfactory marriage to Irina or, alternatively, that it was Irina who needed Rasputin's \\"cure.\\" On the night of the murder, 16/17 December 1916, Rasputin was invited to Felix's apartment at the Moika Palace. He was told that Irina would be in residence and Rasputin would have an opportunity to meet her. Rasputin had often expressed interest in meeting the beautiful 21-year-old princess. Irina, however, was on a visit to the Crimea. Irina had been aware that Felix had talked about eliminating Rasputin and it was originally intended that she participate in the murder. \\"You too must take part in it,\\" Felix wrote to her before the murder. \\"Dm(itri) Pavl(ovich) knows all about it and is helping. It will all take place in the middle of December, when Dm(itri) comes back.\\" In late November 1916, Irina wrote to Felix: \\"Thanks for your insane letter. I didn't understand the half of it. I see that you're planning to do something wild. Please take care and do not get mixed up in any shady business. The dirtiest thing is that you have decided to do it all without me. I don't see how I can take part in it now, since it's all arranged... In a word, be careful. I see from your letter that you're in a state of wild enthusiasm and ready to climb a wall... I'll be in Petrograd on the 12th or 13th, so don't dare do anything without me, or else I won't come at all.\\" Felix responded on 27 November 1916: \\"Your presence by the middle of December is essential. The plan I'm writing you about has been worked out in detail and is three-quarters done, and only the finale is left, and for that your arrival is awaited. It (the murder) is the only way of saving a situation that is almost hopeless.... You will serve as the lure.... Of course, not a word to anyone.\\" A frightened Irina suddenly backed out of the plan on 3 December 1916: \\"I know that if I come, I shall certainly get sick... You don't know how things are with me. I want to cry all the time. My mood is terrible. I've never had one like it before... I don't know myself what's happening to me. Don't drag me to Petrograd. Come down here instead. Forgive me, my dear one, for writing such things to you. But I can't go on any more, I don't know what's the matter with me. Neurasthenia, I think. Don't be angry with me, please don't be angry. I love you terribly. I can't live without you. May the Lord protect you.\\" Again, on 9 December 1916, she warned Felix, reporting a foreboding conversation she had had with their 21-month-old daughter: \\"Something unbelievable's been going on with Baby. A couple of nights ago she didn't sleep well and kept repeating, \\"War, nanny, war!\\" The next day she was asked, \\"War or peace?\\" And Baby answered, \\"War!\\" The next day I said, \\"Say, 'peace.' \\" And she looked right at me and answered, \\"War!\\" It's very strange.\\" The Yusupov Palace (Crimea) near Koreiz Irina's pleas were in vain. Her husband and his co-conspirators went forward with the plan without her. After the killing, Nicolas exiled both Yusupov and Dmitri Pavlovich. Felix was exiled to Rakitnoye, a remote country estate in the Rakityansky District that had been owned by the family since 1729. Dmitri was exiled to the Persian front with the army. Sixteen members of the family signed a letter asking the Tsar to reconsider his decision due to Dmitri's weak health, but Nicholas II refused to consider the petition. \\"Nobody has the right to kill on his own private judgment,\\" wrote Nicholas II. \\"I know that there are many others besides Dmitri Pavlovich whose consciences give them no rest, because they are compromised. I am astonished that you should have applied to me.\\" Irina's father, \\"Sandro\\", visited the couple at Rakitnoye in February 1917 and found their mood \\"buoyant, but militant.\\" Felix still hoped that Nicholas and the Russian government would respond to Rasputin's death by taking steps to address the increasing political unrest. Felix refused to permit Irina to leave Rakitnoye to join her mother in Petrograd because he felt it was too dangerous. The Tsar abdicated on 2 March, OS, and he and his family were arrested by the Bolsheviks. They were eventually murdered at Yekaterinburg on 17 July 1918. His decision to exile Felix and Dmitri meant that they were among the few members of the Romanov family to escape execution during the Bolshevik Revolution that followed. Exile Irina and Felix in exile Following the abdication of the Tsar, the Yusupovs returned to the Moika Palace before going to Crimea. They later returned to the Palace to retrieve jewellery and two paintings by Rembrandt, the sale proceeds of which helped sustain the family in exile. In Crimea, the family boarded a British warship, , which took them from Yalta to Malta. Felix enjoyed boasting about killing Rasputin while he was on the ship. One of the British officers noted that Irina \\"appeared shy and retiring at first, but it was only necessary to take a little notice of her pretty, small daughter to break through her reserve and discover that she was also very charming and spoke fluent English\\". From there, they traveled to Italy and by train to Paris. In Italy, lacking a visa, Felix bribed the officials with diamonds. In Paris, they stayed a few days in H√¥tel de Vend√¥me before they went on to London. In 1920, they returned to Paris and bought a house on the Rue Gutenberg in Boulogne-sur-Seine, where they lived most of their lives. They founded a short-lived couture house called Irf√©, which took its name from the first two letters of the names Irina and Felix. Irina modeled some of the dresses. The Yusupovs became renowned in the Russian √©migr√© community for their financial generosity. This philanthropy and their continued high living and poor financial management extinguished what remained of the family fortune. Their daughter was largely raised (and spoiled) by her paternal grandparents until she was nine. Her unstable upbringing caused her to become \\"capricious,\\" according to Felix. Felix and Irina, raised mainly by nannies themselves, were ill-suited to take on the day-to-day burdens of child-rearing. Irina's daughter adored her father but had a more distant relationship with her mother. Later the family lived from the proceeds of a lawsuit they won against MGM for making a 1932 movie called Rasputin and the Empress. The lecherous Rasputin seduces the Tsar's only niece, called \\"Princess Natasha\\", in the film. Irina was the Czar's only niece by blood, but not his only niece, as he had three nieces from his wife's siblings. In 1934, the Yusupovs won a large judgment against the movie studio. Felix also sued CBS in a New York court in 1965 for televising a play based upon the Rasputin killing. The claim was that some events were fictionalized, and under a New York statute, Felix's commercial rights in his story had been misappropriated. The last reported judicial opinion in the case was a ruling by New York's second highest court that the case could not be resolved upon briefs and affidavits but must go to trial.Youssoupoff v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 19 A.D.2d 865 (1963). According to an obituary of CBS's lawyer, CBS eventually won the case. Felix also wrote his memoirs and continued to be both celebrated and infamous as the man who murdered Rasputin. For the rest of his life, he was haunted by the killing and suffered from nightmares. However, he also had a reputation as a faith healer. Irina and Felix, close to one another as they were distant from their daughter, enjoyed a happy and successful marriage for more than 50 years. When Felix died in 1967, Irina was stricken by grief and died three years later. DNA and descendants A DNA sample from Irina's granddaughter, Xenia Sfyris, was used to identify the remains of Tsar Nicholas II after they were exhumed in 1991, and showed her to belong to mitochondrial haplogroup T, which would also have been borne by Irina The descendants of Irina and Felix are: * Princess Irina Felixovna Yussupova, (21 March 1915, St Petersburg, Russia ‚Äì 30 August 1983, Cormeilles, France), married Count Nikolai Dmitrievich Sheremetev (28 October 1904, Moscow, Russia ‚Äì 5 February 1979, Paris, France), son of Count Dmitri Sergeievich Sheremetev and wife Countess Irina Ilarionovna Vorontzova-Dachkova and a descendant of Boris Petrovich Sheremetev; had issue: ** Countess Xenia Nikolaevna Sheremeteva (born 1 March 1942, Rome, Italy), married on 20 June 1965 in Athens, Greece, to Ilias Sfiris (born 20 August 1932, Athens, Greece); had issue: *** Tatiana Sfiris (born 28 August 1968, Athens, Greece), married on May 1996 in Athens, Greece, to Alexis Giannakoupoulos (born 1963), divorced, no issue; married Anthony Vamvakidis and has issue: **** Marilia Vamvakidi (7 July 2004) **** Yasmine Xenia Vamvakidi (17 May 2006) Ancestry  Footnotes  Inline citations  References     External links  Category:1895 births Category:1970 deaths Category:Burials at Sainte-Genevi√®ve-des-Bois Russian Cemetery Category:House of Yusupov Category:Imperial Russian emigrants to the United Kingdom Category:White Russian emigrants to France Category:Princesses of royal blood (Russia) Category:19th-century Russian people Category:19th-century Russian women Category:Imperial Russian emigrants to France Category:White Russian emigrants to the United Kingdom Category:House of Romanov in exile ","title":"Princess Irina Alexandrovna of Russia"},{"id":"1267945","text":"This page lists unincorporated census-designated places in the state of Maryland in alphabetical order.

6, 1886 ‚Äì October 31, 1973), American physician and cardiologist, was born in Roxbury, Massachusetts, the son of Herbert Warren White and Elizabeth Abigail Dudley. He was one of the leading cardiologists of his day, and a prominent advocate of preventive medicine. Early life and education White's interest in medicine was sparked early in life, when he accompanied his father, a family practitioner, on rounds and house calls in a horse and buggy. A 1903 graduate of the Roxbury Latin School, his undergraduate education at Harvard College encompassed history and forestry as well as pre-medical courses. He graduated with a B.A. with honors in 1908 and went on to Harvard Medical School, from which he received his M.D. in 1911. He then began his long association with the Massachusetts General Hospital through an internship in pediatrics and internal medicine. During that time he co-authored, with Dr. Roger I. Lee, his first scientific paper, on the coagulation of blood. The Lee-White coagulation time is still used today as a method of measuring the speed of blood coagulation. In 1913, White was offered a Harvard traveling fellowship to study cardiovascular physiology with the eminent cardiologist, Thomas Lewis, in London. This experience, perhaps coupled with the earlier death of his sister from rheumatic heart disease and his father's death from coronary artery disease at age seventy-one, was to shape the rest of his medical career. World War I In World War I, White served as a medical officer with the British Expeditionary Force in 1916 and the American Expeditionary Force from 1917 to 1919. He returned to the Massachusetts General Hospital and worked as a resident in 1919, and a year later became Chief of the Medical Out-Patient Department. Academic career White was appointed to the Harvard faculty as a clinical instructor in 1921 and quickly rose through the academic ranks to become assistant professor in 1933, clinical professor in 1946, and emeritus professor in 1949. He continued on the faculty of Harvard until 1956, although he had resigned his position as Chief of the Cardiac Service at the Massachusetts General Hospital in 1948 to devote time to the development of the National Heart Institute, following adoption of the National Heart Act, which was signed into law by President Truman in 1948. White was recognized as a superb teacher and compassionate bedside physician. He published twelve books and more than 700 scientific articles. His most noted textbook, Heart Disease, was first published in 1931 and became a classic in the field. His interest in the electrophysiology of the heart would eventually pair him with Drs. Louis Wolff and John Parkinson, who together described the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, a condition of uncontrolled rapid heartbeat. In 1935 he described the electrocardiographic changes of pulmonary embolism. =Advocacy work= Paul Dudley White is viewed by most medical authorities as the founder of preventive cardiology. Appointed as President Dwight D. Eisenhower's physician following his heart attack in 1955, White very publicly prescribed cycling for his famous patient, giving the bicycle industry a welcome boost. White was a staunch advocate of exercise, diet, and weight control in the prevention of heart disease. In 1924, he was one of the founders of the American Heart Association and became the organization's president in 1941. He was a moving force in the creation of the International Association of Cardiology, and later the International Cardiology Foundation. In 1949, he was named executive director of the National Advisory Heart Council. He was the chief consultant to the National Heart Institute from 1948 to 1955 and w Heart Study , which was the first major epidemiologic work to identify risk factors in coronary artery disease. He was also influential in the American Red Cross and in establishing the National Institutes of Health. White received many international honors and was instrumental in establishing cardiology organizations throughout the world, even in the People's Republic of China which he was one of the first American physicians to visit. He also established a connection with Alexander Filipovich Samoilov, a Soviet physiologist who shared White's interest in the electrophysiology of the heart. White was one of the founders of the International Society of Cardiology in 1946, helped to organize its first World Congress of Cardiology four years later in Paris, and presided over the second World Congress in Washington in 1954. White was a staunch advocate of the belief that lifestyle affected coronary artery disease. He was one of the first authorities to recognize that coronary artery disease could occur in young men, writing several papers on the subject. In keeping with his beliefs, he was a vigorous walker and bicycle rider and walked, on one occasion, from Washington National Airport to the White House to consult with President Eisenhower. Reportedly, his positive approach inspired Lyndon B. Johnson to return to the Senate in 1955 after his heart attack and later to become Vice President. In 1961, NYU awarded Dr. White the prestigious University Medal. On September 14, 1964, President Johnson presented Dr. White with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.The American Presidency Project In his later years, White continued to travel and to speak about heart disease and, increasingly, about his concern for world peace. Personal life On June 28, 1924, White married Ina Helen Reid, a social worker whom he met while giving a lecture at the Smith College Training School for Social Work. They later adopted two children. White spent many summers at Camp Becket in Becket, MA, where the dining hall is named after him. Death and memorials White died in Boston following a second stroke. He was to have received the Herrick Award from the American Heart Association, but died before that honor could be bestowed. A memorial service was held in the Harvard Memorial Church the next month; there, J. Willis Hurst, M.D., a former student of White's, delivered a eulogy entitled \\"I'm Not Through Yet\\".https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/01/archives/dr-paul-dudley-white-is-dead- at-87-pioneer-in-care-of-heart-treated.html The United States Postal Service honored White with a 3¬¢ Great Americans series postage stamp on September 15, 1986. A 17-mile section of the Charles River Bike Path around the Charles River in Boston bears his name. References *\\"Paul Dudley White\\". Dictionary of American Biography, Supplement 9: 1971-1975.

The name spamhaus, a pseudo-German expression, was coined by Linford to refer to an Internet service provider, or other firm, which spams or knowingly provides service to spammers. Anti-spam lists The Spamhaus Project is responsible for compiling several widely used anti-spam lists. Many internet service providers and email servers use the lists to reduce the amount of spam that reaches their users. In 2006, the Spamhaus services protected 650 million email users, including the European Parliament, US Army, the White House and Microsoft, from billions of spam emails a day. Spamhaus distributes the lists in the form of DNS-based Blacklists (DNSBLs) and Whitelists (DNSWLs). The lists are offered as a free public service to low- volume mail server operators on the Internet.Spamhaus DNSBL Usage Commercial spam filtering services and other sites doing large numbers of queries must instead sign up for an rsync-based feed of these DNSBLs, which Spamhaus calls its Datafeed Service. Spamhaus outlines the way its DNSBL technology works in a document called Understanding DNSBL Filtering. The Spamhaus Block List (SBL) targets \\"verified spam sources (including spammers, spam gangs and spam support services).\\" Its goal is to list IP addresses belonging to known spammers, spam operations, and spam-support services. The SBL's listings are partially based on the ROKSO index of known spammers. The Exploits Block List (XBL) targets \\"illegal 3rd party exploits, including open proxies, worms/viruses with built-in spam engines, virus-infected PCs & servers and other types of trojan-horse exploits.\\" That is to say it is a list of known open proxies and exploited computers being used to send spam and viruses. The XBL includes information gathered by Spamhaus as well as by other contributing DNSBL operations such as the Composite Blocking List (CBL). The Policy Block List (PBL) is similar to a Dialup Users List. The PBL lists not only dynamic IP addresses but also static addresses that should not be sending email directly to third-party servers. Examples of such are an ISP's core routers, corporate users required by policy to send their email via company servers, and unassigned IP addresses. Much of the data is provided to Spamhaus by the organizations that control the IP address space, typically ISPs. The Domain Block List (DBL) was released in March 2010 and is a list of domain names, which is both a domain URI Blocklist and RHSBL. It lists spam domains including spam payload URLs, spam sources and senders (\\"right-hand side\\"), known spammers and spam gangs, and phish, virus and malware-related sites. It later added a zone of \\"abused URL shortners\\", a common way spammers insert links into spam emails. The Botnet Controller List (BCL) was released in June 2012 and is a list of IP addresses. It lists IP addresses of which Spamhaus believes to be operated by cybercriminals for the exclusive purpose of hosting botnet Command&Control; infrastructure. Such infrastructure is commonly used by cybercriminals to control malware infected computers. The Spamhaus White List (SWL) was released in October 2010 and is a whitelist of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. The SWL is intended to allow mail servers to separate incoming email traffic into 3 categories: Good, Bad and Unknown. Only verified legitimate senders with clean reputations are approved for whitelisting and there are strict terms to keeping a Spamhaus Whitelist account. The Domain White List (DWL) was released in October 2010 and is a whitelist of domain names. The DWL enables automatic certification of domains with DKIM signatures. Only verified legitimate senders with clean reputations are approved for whitelisting and there are strict terms to keeping a whitelist account. Spamhaus also provides two combined lists. One is the SBL+XBL and the second is called ZEN, which combines all the Spamhaus IP address-based lists. =Register of Known Spam Operations= The Spamhaus Register of Known Spam Operations (ROKSO) is a database of spammers and spam operations who have been terminated from three or more ISPs due to spamming. It contains publicly sourced information about these persons, their domains, addresses and aliases. The ROKSO database allows ISPs to screen new customers, ensuring that ROKSO- listed spammers find it difficult to get hosting. A listing on ROKSO also means that all IP addresses associated with the spammer (his other domains, sites, servers, etc.) get listed on the Spamhaus SBL as \\"under the control of a ROKSO-listed spammer\\" whether there is spam coming from them or not (as a preemptive measure). There is a special version of ROKSO, available to Law Enforcement Agencies, containing data on hundreds of spam gangs, with evidence, logs and information on illegal activities of these gangs, too sensitive to publish in the public part of ROKSO. =Don't Route Or Peer list= The Spamhaus Don't Route Or Peer (DROP) List is a text file delineating CIDR blocks that have been stolen or are otherwise \\"totally controlled by spammers or 100% spam hosting operations\\". As a small subset of the SBL, it does not include address ranges registered to ISPs and sublet to spammers, but only those network blocks wholly used by spammers. It is intended to be incorporated in firewalls and routing equipment to drop all network traffic to and from the listed blocks. The DROP webpage FAQ states the data is free for all to download and use. In 2012 Spamhaus offered a BGP feed of the same DROP data. Companies The Spamhaus Project consists of a number of independent companies which focus on different aspects of Spamhaus anti- spam technology or provide services based around it. At the core is The Spamhaus Project Ltd., which tracks spam sources and publishes free DNSBLs. Further companies include Spamhaus Logistics Corp., which owns the large server infrastructure used by Spamhaus and employs engineering staff to maintain it. Spamhaus Technology Ltd., a data delivery company which \\"manages data distribution and synchronization services\\". Spamhaus Research Corp., a company which \\"develops anti-spam technologies\\". The Spamhaus Whitelist Co. Ltd., which manages the Spamhaus Whitelist. Also there are several references on the Spamhaus website to The Spamhaus Foundation, whose charter is \\"to assure the long-term security of The Spamhaus Project and its work\\".

Conflicts =e360 lawsuit= In September 2006, David Linhardt, the owner-operator of American bulk-emailing company \\"e360 Insight LLC\\", filed suit against Spamhaus in Illinois for blacklisting his mailings. Spamhaus had the case moved from the state court to the U.S. Federal District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and asked to have the case dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The court, presided over by Judge Charles Kocoras, proceeded with the case against Spamhaus without considering the jurisdiction issue, prompting British MP Derek Wyatt to call for the judge to be suspended from office. Not having had its objection to jurisdiction examined, Spamhaus refused to participate in the U.S. case any further and withdrew its counsel. However, Spamhaus was deemed by the court to have \\"technically accepted jurisdiction\\" by having initially responded at all, and the judge, angry at Spamhaus having walked out of his court, awarded e360 a default judgement totaling US$11,715,000 in damages. Spamhaus subsequently announced that it would ignore the judgement because default judgements issued by U.S. courts without a trial \\"have no validity in the U.K. and cannot be enforced under the British legal system\\". Following the ruling in its favour, e360 filed a motion to attempt to force ICANN to remove the domain records of Spamhaus until the default judgement had been satisfied. This raised international issues regarding ICANN's unusual position as an American organization with worldwide responsibility for domain names,(No longer available, but partially archived at U.S. Court Order Could Boost Spam By 50 Billion Daily, Spammer Cajoles ICANN To Ban Spamhaus, Groups.google.com, highspeed and Groups.google.com, abuse.email as of 2007-02-04.) and ICANN protested that they had neither the ability nor the authority to remove the domain records of Spamhaus, which is a UK-based company. On 20 October 2006, Judge Kocoras issued a ruling denying e360's motion against ICANN, stating in his opinion that \\"there has been no indication that ICANN [is] not [an] independent entit[y] [from Spamhaus], thus preventing a conclusion that [it] is acting in concert\\" with Spamhaus and that the court had no authority over ICANN in this matter. The court further ruled that removing Spamhaus's domain name registration was a remedy that was \\"too broad to be warranted in this case\\", because it would \\"cut off all lawful online activities of Spamhaus via its existing domain name, not just those that are in contravention\\" of the default judgment. Kocoras concluded, \\"[w]hile we will not condone or tolerate noncompliance with a valid order of this court [i.e., Spamhaus' refusal to satisfy the default judgement] neither will we impose a sanction that does not correspond to the gravity of the offending conduct\\". In 2007, Chicago law firm Jenner & Block LLP took up Spamhaus's case pro bono publico and appealed the ruling. The U.S. federal Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit vacated the damages award and remanded the matter back to the district court for a more extensive inquiry to determine damages. In January 2008, e360 Insight LLC filed for bankruptcy and closed down, citing astronomical legal bills associated with this court case as the reason for its demise. In 2010, Judge Kocoras reduced the $11.7 million damages award to $27,002‚Äî$1 for tortious interference with prospective economic advantage, $1 for claims of defamation, and $27,000 for \\"existing contracts\\". Both parties appealed, but e360's case for increasing the damages was sharply criticized by Judge Richard Posner of the Seventh Circuit: \\"I have never seen such an incompetent presentation of a damages case,\\" Posner said. \\"It's not only incompetent, it's grotesque. You've got damages jumping around from $11 million to $130 million to $122 million to $33 million. In fact, the damages are probably zero.\\"\\" Appeals judges berate spammer for \\"ridiculous,\\" \\"incompetent\\" litigation\\", Timothy B. Lee, June 14, 2011, artechnica.com On 2 September 2011 the court reduced the damages award to just $3 total, and ordered the plaintiff e360 to pay the costs of the appeal for the defence. =Spamhaus versus nic.at= In June 2007, Spamhaus requested the national domain registry of Austria, nic.at, to suspend a number of domains, claiming they were registered anonymously by phishing gangs for illegal bank phishing purposes. The registry nic.at rejected the request and argued that they would break Austrian law by suspending domains, even though the domains were used for criminal purposes, and demanded proof that the domains were registered under false identities. For some time the domains continued to phish holders of accounts at European banks. Finally, Spamhaus put the mail server of nic.at on their SBL spam blacklist under the SBL's policy \\"Knowingly Providing a Spam Support Service for Profit\\" for several days which caused interference of mail traffic at nic.at. All of the phishing domains in question have been since deleted or suspended by their DNS providers. =Blocking of Google Docs IPs= In August 2010, Spamhaus added some Google-controlled IP addresses used by Google Docs to its SBL spam list, due to Google Docs being a large source of uncontrolled spam. Google quickly fixed the problem and Spamhaus removed the listing. Though initially wrongly reported by some press to be IPs used by Gmail, later it was clarified that only Google Docs was blocked. =CyberBunker dispute and DDoS attack= Diagram showing the role of open resolvers, improperly configured servers vulnerable to IP address spoofing In March 2013, CyberBunker, an internet provider named after its former headquarters in a surplus NATO bunker in the Netherlands that \\"offers anonymous hosting of anything except child porn and anything related to terrorism\\" was added to the Spamhaus blacklist used by email providers to weed out spam. Shortly afterwards, beginning on March 18, Spamhaus was the target of a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack exploiting a long-known vulnerability in the Domain Name System (DNS) which permits origination of massive quantities of messages at devices owned by others using IP address spoofing. Devices exploited in the attack may be as simple as a cable converter box connected to the internet. The attack was of a previously unreported scale (peaking at 300 Gbit/s; an average large-scale attack might reach 50 Gbit/s, and the largest previous publicly reported attack was 100 Gbit/s) was launched against Spamhaus's DNS servers; the effects of the attack had lasted for over a week. Steve Linford, chief executive for Spamhaus, said that they had withstood the attack, using the assistance of other internet companies such as Google to absorb the excess traffic. Linford also claimed that the attack was being investigated by five different national cyber-police-forces around the world, who had chosen to remain anonymous to avoid similar attacks on their own infrastructure. Spamhaus also hired Cloudflare, a DDoS mitigation company, to assist them by distributing their internet services across Cloudflare's worldwide network, after which the focus of the attack was redirected to the companies that provide Cloudflare's network connections. Spamhaus alleged that CyberBunker, in cooperation with \\"criminal gangs\\" from Eastern Europe and Russia, was behind the attack; CyberBunker did not respond to the BBC's request for comment on the allegation; however, Sven Olaf Kamphuis, the owner of CyberBunker, posted to his Facebook account on 23 March \\"Yo anons, we could use a little help in shutting down illegal slander and blackmail censorship project 'spamhaus.org,' which thinks it can dictate its views on what should and should not be on the Internet.\\" According to The New York Times Kamphuis also claimed to be the spokesman of the attackers, and said in a message \\"We are aware that this is one of the largest DDoS attacks the world had publicly seen\\", and that CyberBunker was retaliating against Spamhaus for \\"abusing their influence\\". The NYT added that security researcher Dan Kaminsky said \\"You can‚Äôt stop a DNS flood ... The only way to deal with this problem is to find the people doing it and arrest them\\". The attack was attributed by network engineers to an anonymous group unhappy with Spamhaus, later identified by the victims of the attack as Stophaus, a loosely organized group of \\"bulletproof spam and malware hosters\\". On 26 April 2013, the owner of CyberBunker, Sven Olaf Kamphuis, was arrested in Spain for his part in the attack on Spamhaus. He has since been released pending trial. The British National Cyber Crime Unit revealed that a London schoolboy had been secretly arrested as part of a suspected organised crime gang responsible for the DDoS attacks. A briefing document giving details of the schoolboy‚Äôs alleged involvement states: \\"The suspect was found with his computer systems open and logged on to various virtual systems and forums. The subject has a significant amount of money flowing through his bank account. Financial investigators are in the process of restraining monies.\\" =Ames v. The Spamhaus Project Ltd= In 2014, Spamhaus was sued by California-based entrepreneurs Craig Ames and Rob McGee, who were involved with a bulk email marketing services business, initially through a US corporation called Blackstar Media LLC, and latterly as employees of Blackstar Marketing, a subsidiary of the English company Adconion Media Group Limited, which bought Blackstar Media in April 2011. Although an initial motion by Spamhaus to strike out the claims failed, they ultimately prevailed when the claimants dropped their case and paid Spamhaus' legal costs.

He was a key figure in the United States abolitionist movement in the years leading up to the Civil War and the growth of the Episcopal Church in Massachusetts. He was instrumental in the establishment of the University of Kansas and Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin. Early life Lawrence was born in Boston, Massachusetts on July 31, 1814.Lawrence, William Richards (ed.). 1855. Extracts from the Diary and Correspondence of the Late Amos Lawrence. Boston: Gould & Lincoln, p. 15. Lee, Laura (ed.). 2001. The Name's Familiar II. Gretna: Pelican, p. 208. His father, Amos Lawrence, was a merchant, philanthropist, and member of the prominent Lawrence family. He was educated at Groton Academy and was graduated at Harvard College in 1835. Career Following his graduation from Harvard, Lawrence entered business for himself as a commission merchant and eventually became owner of Ipswich Mills, the largest producer of knit goods in the country. In 1858 and 1860, he was a candidate for governor of Massachusetts. =Philanthropy= Lawrence financed the founding of the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas, which was named after him. In 1847, he founded a college that is today Lawrence University on of land that he had purchased in 1844 in the Fox River Valley. Some of the land he purchased became Appleton, Wisconsin, named for his father-in-law. His farm outside of Boston became the campus for Boston College. From 1857 to 1862 he was treasurer of Harvard College, and from 1879 to 1885 an overseer. Lawrence also contributed large sums of money to Harvard, the Episcopal Theological School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Lawrence Academy, and the Groton School. =Abolitionism and the Civil War= Lawrence credited the Anthony Burns affair in the spring of 1854 with radicalizing him and other cotton merchants on the issue of slavery: \\"[W]e went to bed one night old fashioned, conservative, Compromise Union Whigs & waked up stark mad Abolitionists.\\"James M. McPherson. Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era. New York: Bantam Books, 1989, p. 120. Lawrence contributed large amounts of capital to the Massachusetts Emigrant Aid Company and funds for the colonization of free negroes in Liberia. He donated guns, specifically Sharps rifles, which were shipped to Jayhawkers and abolitionists in Kansas as \\"books\\" and \\"primers.\\" During the bloodshed in Kansas, Lawrence wrote frequently to his cousin President Franklin Pierce on behalf of the free-state settlers. He also provided funds for the activism and legal defense of John Brown, though he deplored Brown's fanaticism and urged against violent resistance to the federal government. When Brown was arrested at Harpers Ferry, Lawrence appealed to the Governor of Virginia to secure a lawful trial. In 1862, he raised a battalion of cavalry which became the 2nd Massachusetts Cavalry, of which Charles Russell Lowell was colonel. Personal life He married Sarah Appleton, daughter of U.S. Representative William Appleton and Mary Ann (n√©e Cutler) Appleton. They had four children: * Amory Appleton Lawrence (1848‚Äì1912) * William Lawrence (1850‚Äì1941), who became the Bishop of Massachusetts. * Susan Mason Lawrence (1852‚Äì1923) * Harriet Lawrence Hemenway (1858-1960), who became a co-founder of the Massachusetts Audubon Society. =Descendants= Through his son William, Lawrence was the grandfather of William Appleton Lawrence (1889‚Äì1968), who was elected third Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Western Massachusetts, and Frederic Cunningham Lawrence (1899‚Äì1989), a suffragan bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts. Death and legacy He died at his summer resort in Nahant, Massachusetts in 1886. =Legacy= Lawrence is credited with founding an Episcopal church in Boston, Massachusetts which prompted many Boston Brahmins to convert from Unitarianism. His son, William Lawrence, became the long-time Bishop of the Episcopal Church in Massachusetts. His alma mater, Groton Academy was later renamed after him. Today, it is the Lawrence Academy at Groton. Notes References * Lawrence Townie history * History of Cottage Farm, Brookline * Lawrence, William (1888). Life of Amos A.

It is set in Salford, Lancashire, (now in Greater Manchester), in 1971, in a mixed-ethnicity British household headed by Pakistani father George (Om Puri) and an English mother, Ella (Linda Bassett). East Is East is based on the 1996 play East is East by Ayub Khan-Din, which opened at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre in October 1996 and Royal Court Theatre in November 1996. The title derives from the 1889 Rudyard Kipling poem \\"The Ballad of East and West\\", of which the opening line reads: \\"Oh East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet\\". Plot George Khan is a Pakistani Muslim who has lived in Britain since 1937. He has a wife in Pakistan. He and his second wife Ella, a British Roman Catholic woman of Irish descent, have been married for twenty-five years and have seven children; Nazir, Abdul, Tariq, Maneer, Saleem, Meenah (the only daughter) and Sajid. George and Ella run a popular fish and chip shop. While George is obsessed with the 1971 war between East and West Pakistan and arranging marriages for his children, the children themselves, born and brought up in Britain, increasingly see themselves as British and reject Pakistani dress, food, religion and living. After George disowns Nazir for running out on his arranged marriage, he immediately begins making plans to have another of his children married to maintain his image. On a trip to Bradford, George is introduced to Mr Shah, a fellow Pakistani Muslim who wishes to marry off his two unattractive daughters. George arranges in secret for his second and third sons, Abdul and Tariq, to marry them, despite Ella's misgivings, a conversation that the youngest child, Sajid, overhears. During a quarrel, Sajid reveals the arranged marriages to his brothers; Tariq, the most rebellious son and in a relationship with a local girl, flies into a rage and defiles the wedding garments George had bought. The most obedient son, Maneer, is caught by George trying to tidy the mess up and beaten when he refuses to tell George who was responsible; Ella intervenes and is also beaten. Tariq travels to Eccles and tracks down Nazir, who is in a homosexual relationship and returns to confront George for his actions. However, upon seeing Ella's and Maneer's bruises, he becomes frightened his appearance will anger George further and make the situation worse for his siblings and his mother. Ella urges him to go, so he obeys her wish and flees before George catches sight of him. After a heated argument with his father, Tariq reluctantly agrees to go along with the marriage. Mr and Mrs Shah arrive with their daughters to meet George's family. Ella maintains her composure despite Mrs Shah's condescending and rude attitude, but things come to a head when a scuffle ensues over a sculpture of a vagina and Saleem accidentally drops it on Mrs Shah's lap. Angered, Mrs Shah insults George's entire family and is ejected from the house by Ella along with her husband and daughters. Enraged, George attacks Ella but is stopped by Abdul and the other children long enough for him to see how his actions have turned his entire family against him, and leaves the household in shame to seek solace in his shop. In the aftermath, George and Ella make amends over tea while the kids play in the street.

In the most basic scenario there is a Web Service Provider that publishes a service and a Web Service Consumer that uses this service. Web Service Discovery is the process of finding suitable web services for a given task. Publishing a web service involves creating a software artifact and making it accessible to potential consumers. Web service providers augment a service endpoint interface with an interface description using the Web Services Description Language (WSDL) so that a consumer can use the service. Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI) is an XML-based registry for business internet services. A provider can explicitly register a service with a Web Services Registry such as UDDI or publish additional documents intended to facilitate discovery such as Web Services Inspection Language (WSIL) documents. The service users or consumers can search web services manually or automatically. The implementation of UDDI servers and WSIL engines should provide simple search APIs or web-based GUI to help find Web services. Web services may also be discovered using multicast mechanisms like WS-Discovery, thus reducing the need for centralized registries in smaller networks.  Federated Discovery  The current UDDI search mechanism can only focus on a single search criterion, such as business name, business location, business category, service type by name, business identifier, or discovery URL. In fact, in a business solution, it is very normal to search multiple UDDI registries or WSIL documents and then aggregate the returned result by using filtering and ranking techniques. IBM modularized this federated Web Services Discovery engine in 2001. The released technology from IBM is Business Explorer for Web Services (BE4WS). Universal Description Discovery and Integration Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI, pronounced ) is a platform-independent, Extensible Markup Language protocol that includes a (XML-based) registry by which businesses worldwide can list themselves on the Internet, and a mechanism to register and locate web service applications. UDDI is an open industry initiative, sponsored by the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS), for enabling businesses to publish service listings and discover each other, and to define how the services or software applications interact over the Internet. UDDI was originally proposed as a core Web service standard. It is designed to be interrogated by SOAP messages and to provide access to Web Services Description Language (WSDL) documents describing the protocol bindings and message formats required to interact with the web services listed in its directory. History of UDDI UDDI was written in August 2000, at a time when the authors had a vision of a world in which consumers of web services would be linked up with providers through a public or private dynamic brokerage system. In this vision, anyone needing a service, such as credit card authentication, would go to their service broker and select a service supporting the desired SOAP (or other) service interface, and meeting other criteria. In such a world, the publicly operated UDDI node or broker would be critical for everyone. For the consumer, public or open brokers would only return services listed for public discovery by others, while for a service producer, getting a good placement in the brokerage‚Äîby relying on metadata of authoritative index categories‚Äîwould be critical for effective placement. UDDI was included in the Web Services Interoperability (WS-I) standard as a central pillar of web services infrastructure, and the UDDI specifications supported a publicly accessible Universal Business Registry in which a naming system was built around the UDDI-driven service broker. UDDI has not been as widely adopted as its designers had hoped. UDDI R.I.P IBM, Microsoft, and SAP announced they were closing their public UDDI nodes in January 2006. The group defining UDDI, the OASIS Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI) Specification Technical Committee voted to complete its work in late 2007 and has been closed. Message announcing closure of Technical Committee In September 2010, Microsoft announced they were removing UDDI services from future versions of the Windows Server operating system. Instead, this capability would be moved to BizTalk Server. In 2013, Microsoft further announced the deprecation of UDDI Services in BizTalk Server. In 2016, Microsoft removed UDDI Services from BizTalk Server. UDDI systems are most commonly found inside companies, where they are used to dynamically bind client systems to implementations . However, much of the search metadata permitted in UDDI is not used for this relatively simple role. Structure of UDDI A UDDI business registration consists of three components: * White Pages ‚Äî address, contact, and known identifiers; * Yellow Pages ‚Äî industrial categorizations based on standard taxonomies; * Green Pages ‚Äî technical information about services exposed by the business. =White Pages= White pages give information about the business supplying the service. This includes the name of the business and a description of the business - potentially in multiple languages. Using this information, it is possible to find a service about which some information is already known (for example, locating a service based on the provider's name).Taylor, Ian J. From P2P to Web Services and Grids - Peers in a Client/Server World. Springer, 2005 Contact information for the business is also provided - for example the businesses address and phone number; and other information such as the Dun & Bradstreet. =Yellow Pages= Yellow pages provide a classification of the service or business, based on standard taxonomies. These include the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC), the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), or the United Nations Standard Products and Services Code (UNSPSC) and geographic taxonomies. Because a single business may provide a number of services, there may be several Yellow Pages (each describing a service) associated with one White Page (giving general information about the business). =Green Pages= Green pages are used to describe how to access a Web Service, with information on the service bindings. Some of the information is related to the Web Service - such as the address of the service and the parameters, and references to specifications of interfaces. Other information is not related directly to the Web Service - this includes e-mail, FTP, CORBA and telephone details for the service. Because a Web Service may have multiple bindings (as defined in its WSDL description), a service may have multiple Green Pages, as each binding will need to be accessed differently. UDDI nodes and registry UDDI nodes are servers which support the UDDI specification and belong to a UDDI registry while UDDI registries are collections of one or more nodes. SOAP is an XML-based protocol to exchange messages between a requester and a provider of a Web Service. The provider publishes the WSDL to UDDI and the requester can join to it using SOAP.

A roller coaster train is a vehicle made up of two or more cars connected by specialized joints which transports passengers around a roller coaster's circuit. It is called a train because the cars follow one another around the track, the same reason as for a railroad train. Individual cars vary in design and can carry from one to eight or more passengers each. Many roller coasters operate more than one train, sometimes several, simultaneously. Typically they operate two trains at a time, with one train loading and unloading while the other train runs the course. On the Rock 'n' Roller Coaster at Walt Disney World, for example, there are five trains, but only four operate at a time (the trains are rotated out on a regular basis for safety reasons).  Basic safety features  =Wheels= Roller coaster wheels Roller coaster trains have wheels that run on the sides (side friction or guide wheels) and underneath the track (upstop, underfriction, or underlocking wheels) as well as on top of it (road or running wheels); these lock the train to the tracks and prevent it from jumping the track. The side wheels can be mounted on the outside or inside of the train, depending on the manufacturer (although outside-mounted wheels are more common). The wheels are sometimes located between the cars, as well as at the front and rear of the entire train. =Restraints= An inverted roller coaster car with over-the-shoulder restraints Roller coaster trains also have restraints that keep the passengers in their seats. There are two major types of restraints: lap bar and over-the-shoulder. (Most modern over-the-shoulder restraints come into contact with riders at the lap; however, older so-called \\"horsecollar\\" ones actually restrain riders by the shoulders). Restraints always use two locking mechanisms, one on each side, for redundancy. If one fails, the restraint will remain locked. Most modern roller coasters also have seat belts that may act as secondary safety devices. On over-the-shoulder restraints, this seatbelt is mostly cosmetic as the restraint locks on its own. Lap bars were first used in 1907 with the Coney Island coaster Drop the Dip. Lap bar restraints consist of a padded bar mounted to the floor or side of the train that swings backwards into the rider's lap. These restraints are usually found on roller coasters that lack inversions. Some inverting roller coasters, notably ones created by Anton Schwarzkopf safely operate without the need for shoulder restraints. Historically, inverting roller coasters with lap bars could only perform vertical loops, as the higher centripetal force (and low lateral force) exerted while traversing a simple clothoid loop helps to keep riders safely in the train. However, with modern advances in engineering, more roller coasters with complicated inversions are able to run without over- the-shoulder restraints. For example, most of Premier Rides' LIM-launched roller coasters (the vast majority of which have multiple inverting elements) operate with only lap bars. Lap bar restraints, like buzz bars give the rider much greater freedom of movement than over-the-shoulder restraints, enhancing the feeling of danger for some. Blackbeard's Lost Treasure Train (1999) at Six Flags Great Adventure has trains composed of 20 cars. Over-the-shoulder restraints, the most common type, consist of a roughly U-shaped padded bar mounted to the top of each seat that swings downward. Roller coasters that have inversions usually have this type of restraint. Additionally, almost all inverted and floorless roller coasters have this type of restraint, since it is difficult to mount a lap bar restraint. One disadvantage of over-the- shoulder restraints is that they can provide discomfort to the rider (known among coaster enthusiasts as headbanging), especially on rougher roller coasters. It is recommended that earrings should be removed before riding roller coasters with over-the-shoulder restraints. Some rides, such as Maverick at Cedar Point, require that guests must remove earrings before riding. However, there are some operating roller coasters that do not have either restraint systems. Rollo Coaster at Idlewild and Soakzone is a good example of this. Usually roller coasters with little to no air-time (being lifted out of your seat) do not have restraints. Until early 2006, The Rollercoaster at Blackpool Pleasure Beach in the UK also operated without any restraints, although seatbelts were added to the ride in the 2007 season. During 2008, trains from the Big Dipper Rollercoaster were installed on the ride. \\"The Rollercoaster\\" now operates with lap bars, although the original train is still stored on the transfer track in the station.  Physics  At a given velocity, the longer a roller coaster train becomes, the more momentum it gains throughout the ride's course. A roller coaster train that is fully loaded will also have more momentum than one that is empty or nearly empty.

It was released on July 23, 1996.  Background  During the \\"Amorica or Bust\\" tour of 1995, many of the relationships within The Black Crowes had soured, the most public of which was the one between brothers Chris and Rich Robinson. \\"We just fucking hated each other,\\" Rich noted in the September 1996 issue of Acoustic Guitar magazine. \\"It's just a normal phase bands go through. There was a lot of emotional baggage, and everyone got on each other's nerves. We almost broke up a few times, but finally we all let go and moved on.\\" Chris echoed his brother's sentiment in the March 1996 issue of Guitar World magazine. \\"Everyone goes through changes,\\" he stated. \\"The trick is trying to remember that and keep it together, and having respect for everyone and not judging people because you're all goin' through changes. Perseverance is the thing. You have to get your ego in place.\\" With this new attitude in place, the band began planning what would be their fourth studio album. Their previous album, 1994's Amorica, was very much a studio recording, with a great deal of overdubs and other musical flourishes. This was a distinct change from the band's sophomore effort, 1992's The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion, which was recorded in eight days with little to no overdubs. A great deal of this was attributed to producer Jack Joseph Puig, who manned the board for Amorica. \\"The eight day album was coming off of 15 months of touring and we were still just flying,\\" then-bassist Johnny Colt told RockNet in 1995. \\"This time we took some time off beforehand and tried to slow down...We consciously tried to take more time. I'm not even saying we really needed it, but we wanted to try it. We have worked ourselves into a position to afford to spend a little bit more time and try to make a different step.\\" Chris Robinson had a slightly different tone to his take on Amorica. \\"(It) wasn't hard to make because it was our third album,\\" he told MOJO magazine in July 1996. \\"It was hard to make because we were depressed and in an angry, confused place. Most of it was personal shit.\\" Rather than make another \\"studio\\" record like Amorica, the band opted for a different approach in the latter months of 1995. \\"Chris suggested that rather than book a hotel for six months, it'd be cooler if we rented a house for everyone to stay in,\\" Rich Robinson noted in 1996. \\"So Chris moved into the house, and I brought my little board over to work on the demos. It sounded so cool that I brought my big board over, and the rest of my shit, and we rented a Neve sidecar for 10 extra channels. And we just did it.\\" Writing and production As pre- production for Three Snakes and One Charm began, several songs were written with Chris and Rich Robinson on different sides of the United States. Rich would write and record music in Atlanta, GA and send his results to Chris in Los Angeles, CA. \\"The long-distance writing was just something we did to get the process more concrete,\\" Rich told Acoustic Guitar magazine in 1996. \\"I had a lot of bits and pieces that I'd written on tour and I needed to hear what Chris would do with them.\\" Once the basic ideas were recorded to tape, the band assembled in the house in Atlanta, GA (dubbed Chateau de la Crowe by the band) to begin the Three Snakes sessions. Then-keyboardist Eddie Harsch recalls: \\"\\"When we got to Atlanta, Chris and Rich put us in a room and played us the demos. The record was basically written. Twelve songs with vocals, dogs barking in the background, everything. We just looked at each other, like, 'What do you want us to do? It's all here.\\" There proved to be a great deal more to do, with the band spending several weeks refining their original demos. Plus, a few other songs were written on the spot, including \\"Under a Mountain\\" and \\"Better When You're Not Alone.\\" In total, the band recorded twenty-six songs during the sessions. It was during the recording of Three Snakes that the band decided to introduce new elements into the music, the most noticeable being a horn section on \\"(Only) Halfway to Everywhere\\" and \\"Let Me Share The Ride.\\" \\"That was the Dirty Dozen Brass Band,\\" Rich commented in 1996. \\"They opened for us last year (1995) through the whole American leg of (our) tour. Chris just said, 'Fuck it. We've never had horns that we like. Let's go for it.'\\" The band attributed the sonic textures of Three Snakes to the nuances of recording in a house. \\"It's a totally different vibe doing it in a house, much more conducive to being creative,\\" Rich Robinson commented in 1996. Other members of the band credited the more communal atmosphere of Chateau de la Crowe with making the album a success. \\"We lived and breathed together all day long,\\" remembers then-bassist Johnny Colt. \\"It was a caravan of people; people upstairs watching crazy art films, people cutting tracks and eating food. There were dogs running everywhere. And (producer) Jack (Joseph Puig) was pulling his hair out over the whole thing of course.\\" Then-guitarist Marc Ford concurred with Colt's sentiment, adding that the atmosphere created by recording in a house fostered his musical relationship with Rich Robinson. \\"It just keeps flowering,\\" he noted in 1996. \\"Rich used to insist he was a rhythm player, and I told him to stick his toe as a lead player in the water a little bit, and now we're playing with each other, listening to each other. You can do all that sound-weaving.\\" With the bulk of the recording process done, the band returned to Ocean Way Studios in Los Angeles, CA to put on the finishing touches and begin the mastering process. Promotion and release The Black Crowes began the supporting tour for Three Snakes and One Charm on July 5, 1996 in Burbank, CA, where the album was given its world premiere. The album would see its official release on July 23, 1996, several weeks into a world tour that would go straight through the end of the year and into the next, expanding their in-concert repertoire to over ninety songs. As a means of promotion, the band performed several radio and television broadcasts to showcase the new album. The most noteworthy of these appearances came when the band appeared on the television program VH1 Storytellers in the Summer of 1996. The show was relatively new at the time, with each episode capturing artists performing in front of a (mostly small and intimate) live audience, telling stories about their music, writing experiences and memories.Storytellers (TV series) The Black Crowes' installment was the fifth in the series, which saw eighty-seven episodes over its original run. Three Snakes garnered generally positive reviews upon its release. Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave album three stars on AllMusic, stating the album was \\"a winning album, mainly because the Black Crowes' musicianship continues to deepen -- the musical fusions and eclecticism are seamless.\\" Rolling Stone magazine also gave the album three stars, noting that it \\"works best when it forsakes album- oriented pretension for singular clarity, from the oblique Beatles references on 'Nebakanezer' and 'Bring On, Bring On' to the Sly Stone-cum-Al Green funk of '(Only) Halfway to Everywhere' and the warm acoustic resignation of 'Better When You're Not Alone.'\\" The album's cover logo resembles a 45 rpm record insert. A limited box set edition of the album was also made available, comprising seven 7\\" vinyl EPs, a 45rpm custom adapter in shape of the album's cover logo and a one-sided poster of the band.

One of the largest recorded earthquakes in the United States, with an estimated moment magnitude of 7.9, it ruptured the southern part of the San Andreas Fault for a length of about 225 miles (350 kilometers), between Parkfield and Wrightwood. Though the shock was centered near Parkfield, the event is referred to as the Fort Tejon earthquake, because that was the location of the greatest damage. Fort Tejon is just north of the junction of the San Andreas and Garlock Faults, where the Tehachapi, San Emigdio, and Sierra Pelona Transverse Ranges come together. The earthquake is the most recent large event to occur along that portion of the San Andreas Fault, and is estimated to have had a maximum perceived intensity of IX (Violent) on the Modified Mercalli scale (MM) near Fort Tejon in the Tehachapi Mountains, and along the San Andreas Fault from Mil Potrero (near Pine Mountain Club) in the San Emigdio Mountains to Lake Hughes in the Sierra Pelona Mountains. Accounts of the events' effects varied widely, including the time of the main shock as well as foreshocks that occurred at several locations earlier in the morning. Tectonic setting The 1857 earthquake ruptured about of the southern part of the San Andreas Fault, the structure that accommodates most of the displacement along the transform boundary between the North American Plate and the Pacific Plate. The Pacific Plate is moving north relative to the Sierra Nevada-Great Valley Block of the North American Plate at about per year. The displacement rate along the various sections that ruptured is per year along the Parkfield, Cholame, Carrizo and Big Bend sections and and per year along the Mojave north and Mojave south sections. Paleoseismic studies have found evidence for many prehistoric earthquakes in the last 3,000 years on this part of the San Andreas Fault. Earthquake The earthquake ruptured a substantial portion of the southern San Andreas fault, but not the entire length. Thomas H. Jordan, director of the Southern California Earthquake Center, stated that the slip likely stopped in the area near Cajon Pass, perhaps because the tectonic stresses on that part of the fault had been released several decades earlier during the 1812 Wrightwood earthquake. The average slip along the fault was , and a maximum offset of was recorded in the Carrizo Plain area in southeastern San Luis Obispo County. With an estimated magnitude of 7.9, this was the last \\"Big One\\" in Southern California. The extreme southernmost portion of the San Andreas fault, which terminates near Bombay Beach at the Salton Sea, last ruptured in 1680. Surface faulting may have extended beyond the boundaries of the regularly acknowledged slip length. Researchers recorded first and second-hand accounts of the ground crack, which was understood to be recent surface faulting and not just the topography of the existing rift. On the extreme northern end of the rupture zone, the surface cracking extended north of Cholame into San Benito County. On the southern end, the population centers were not as close to the fault, and early observers were probably limited to the stretch of the fault between Fort Tejon and Elizabeth Lake, as that was close to the Stockton ‚Äì Los Angeles Road, the primary inland north‚àísouth route then. Evidence of uprooted and displaced trees south of Elizabeth Lake indicates surface faulting along a mole track (an \\"array of en echelon primary Riedel shears with linking compressional rolls and minor thrusts\\") that ran directly under three Jeffrey Pines. Two of the three trees examined were tilted in their lower extremity, while the upper portions remained relatively untilted. Tree ring dating confirmed that the trees had originated 10 and 25 years before 1857 and also that the rings began to grow twice as thick on the side in the direction of the tilt. This is a frequently noted compensation of tree tilt. Seismologist Kerry Sieh determined that fault slip and the associated ground disturbance was the source of the mole track and subsequent tree tilt. =Foreshocks= An isoseismal map for the main shock Various accounts of the event indicate the presence of foreshocks between one and nine hours before the main event, and based on the (uncertain) distribution of those shocks, it is assumed that the beginning of the fault rupture (the epicenter) was in the area between Parkfield and Cholame, about northwest. The lack of standardized timekeeping during this period of California's history contributed to some of the inaccurate reports of when the pre-shocks occurred. Local solar time was being used in 1857 and San Francisco would have been the locality with the most accurate time kept as it was a center of commerce and other activity. Standard time was not followed until the 1880s, with the Pacific Time Zone being aligned with the 120th meridian. The differences in local times were substantial, with San Francisco at 122.43 W and San Diego at 117.10 W, the difference between the two would be around 22 minutes (4 minutes per degree). At least one individual reported foreshock times that varied by as much as half an hour when speaking to two different newspapers. The firsthand reports were most abundant for the shocks felt at 1, 2, and 4 hours before the main shock which were later labeled the predawn, dawn, and sunrise shocks. The predawn event shook residents of San Francisco (MM II ‚Äì III), San Jose (MM IV), and Santa Cruz (MM IV). The dawn shock was felt in those locales plus Fort Tejon and possibly the Carrizo Plain. The sunrise shock was felt in San Francisco (MM III), Monterey (MM IV), and Visalia (MM II ‚Äì III). Sacramento and Los Angeles did not report any of these events. Several mid- twentieth-century earthquakes had similar felt reports to the dawn and sunrise shocks and with close inspection, Sieh theorizes that both events were local to coastal central California, probably between Point Conception and Monterey. Also, during that period, no central California earthquake with a magnitude of less than five had a felt area as large as the two foreshocks, while events larger than magnitude six have had \\"somewhat larger\\" felt areas, so it could be said that the foreshocks most likely were between magnitude five and six. Parkfield earthquakes occurred with exceptionally regular intervals (between 20 and 30 years) between 1857 and 1966. Sieh studied four of these events (1901, 1922, 1934, and 1966) and found that they helped to determine the southeast boundary for the origination of the dawn foreshock. The coverage and intensities of felt reports for that earthquake show a solid resemblance to the Parkfield events. Only one of the four Parkfield events was not felt further southeast than the dawn shock, so Sieh concluded that if the San Andreas was the source of the event, then it was reasonable to assume that the Parkfield to Cholame stretch of the fault was responsible for producing the dawn felt intensities, though the San Andreas is not the only possible source for the dawn event. For example, the November 22, 1952, magnitude six Bryson earthquake \\"nearly duplicates\\" the felt reports. That event may have occurred west of the San Andreas on the Nacimiento fault, though the highest felt reports were along the Rinconada fault around southwest of the San Andreas. =Damage= Most of the adobe buildings at Fort Tejon were badly damaged and several people were injured there. More buildings were destroyed along a twenty-mile stretch between Fort Tejon and southeast to Elizabeth Lake, a sag pond that was formed directly on the San Andreas fault. Streams and springs experienced disturbances in San Diego and Santa Barbara Counties, while the Kern River, Kern Lake, and Los Angeles River all spilled over their banks. Farther north in Santa Clara County the flow of well water was affected. Ground cracks from liquefaction of swampy ground were observed near the Pueblo de Los Angeles and in the Oxnard Plain, and ground fissures were reported near the Los Angeles, Santa Ana, and Santa Clara Rivers. Central and southern California were thinly populated at the time and this likely helped limit the damage from the earthquake, but the lack of people present also reduced the number of perspectives to use in determining intensity estimates. Areas with the highest population density like San Francisco, Stockton, and Los Angeles provided enough information about the effects of the earthquake to provide the best estimates of intensity. At downtown Los Angeles, with a maximum perceived intensity of VI, some homes and buildings were cracked, but no major damage was reported. In Ventura (MM VII) the roof of Mission San Buenaventura collapsed and the bell tower was damaged, and farther north, the front wall of the old adobe Mission Santa Cruz chapel collapsed. One of the two deaths reported included a woman who was killed by a collapsing adobe house in nearby Gorman, and an elderly man may have collapsed and died in the Los Angeles area as a result of the earthquake. =Aftershocks= The mainshock was followed by a series of aftershocks that continued for at least 3.75 years, although the total number of large aftershocks was less than would be expected for an earthquake of this size. The four largest aftershocks all had magnitudes greater than 6, although there are large uncertainties in both location and magnitude due to the limited number of data points available. On the night of January 9 there was a large aftershock with an estimated magnitude of about 6.25, with a possible epicenter near the Garlock Fault. The largest aftershock occurred on the afternoon of January 16 with an estimated magnitude of about 6.7, with a possible offshore location, and high felt intensities in Southern California communities. Santa Barbara and San Bernardino reported an MM intensity of V and Los Angeles reported V and VI. Two significant events occurred in the San Bernardino area on December 15‚Äì16, 1858, with the latter having an estimated magnitude of about 6. The last recorded major aftershock occurred on April 16, 1860, with an estimated magnitude of about 6.3, with an epicenter close to the Parkfield section of the San Andreas Fault. Future threat Scientists and public service officials have speculated on the threat of another very large earthquake occurring in southern California and what type and scale of damage might result. The portion of the fault that ruptured in 1857 has settled into a period of dormancy and this has given rise to suggestions that future slip along that zone may be characterized by a very large 1857-type event followed by another period of inactivity. The communities of Frazier Park, Palmdale, and Wrightwood are all located very close to the San Andreas fault, though much of the Los Angeles area could be affected even at a greater distance from the rupture area if a similar event were to reoccur there. Swaminathan Krishnan, assistant professor of civil engineering and geophysics at the California Institute of Technology, said that if a similar rupture from Parkfield to Wrightwood were to happen again, it would severely affect the Los Angeles area, with the San Fernando Valley being particularly hard hit. The Los Angeles Aqueduct and California Aqueduct, two of the principal water transfer infrastructure systems supplying Greater Los Angeles, both cross the San Andreas fault within the main damage zone of the Fort Tejon earthquake, in the Tehachapi and Sierra Pelona Mountains.

The FishBase and IUCN continue to recognize the Scottish powan as a distinct species, Coregonus clupeoides. Ecology This fish is benthopelagic, feeding on the lakebed on insect larvae and crustaceans. In Loch Lomond, this fish exhibits a pattern of daily migration to feeding sites and of seasonal migration to breeding grounds. Before the breeding season, the mature males begin to congregate in deep water near the spawning beds; these are shallow areas of gravel and pebbles washed by waves. In late December and January they move into the shallows where they are joined by the ripe females, and spawning is completed by early February, after which the fish disperse to other parts of the lake. The eggs are eaten by brown trout (Salmo trutta), common roach (Rutilus rutilus), other powan and Phryganea larvae, and the adult powan are heavily predated by the northern pike (Esox lucius) at breeding time.

Rules and etiquette are generally the same for speed golf and regular golf with minor exceptions. * In the interest of time, a golfer is allowed to putt with the flagstick left in the hole. Note: As of January 1, 2019, a golfer is allowed to putt with the flagstick left in the hole in regular golf, also. *Unless otherwise told by a tournament committee, speed golfers are expected to rake bunkers, fix ball marks and conform to normal golf course dress code, although most speed golfers will wear running shoes instead of golf shoes. * In the case of a lost ball or one that is hit out of bounds, players are permitted to play it like a lateral hazard because it was thought to be too severe of a penalty to have to also be penalized the additional time to run back to where the original shot was played. Aside from the normal 14-club maximum, there is no rule about how many clubs a player is allowed to bring. However, players typically carry 4‚Äì7 clubs. History The sport was believed to have been started in 1979 California when former American record holder in the mile (3:47.69 in 1982) Steve Scott ran around a golf course in 29 minutes and 33 seconds shooting a 95 with only a 3-iron. After hearing about Scott, a former ironman triathlete and teaching pro named Jay Larson became the person who many considered the top speed golfer of the 1990s. Larson once shot a 75 in 39 minutes and 9 seconds on a 6,500 course with a slope rating of 125 (using the old rules of speed golf where one could have a caddy in a cart riding out in front of you carrying your clubs and calling out distances as you approached the ball). Towards the end of the 1990s, in an effort to help promote the sport, Oregonians and speed golfers Tim Scott (a former teaching pro turned school teacher), Christopher Smith, and Jim Kosciolek (a Chicago-based lawyer) founded a company called Speed Golf International. The sport is now played in North America, Europe and Japan, and major tournaments are telecast by channels such as ESPN, CBS, and The Golf Channel. Tournaments The oldest known speed golf tournament is the Bob-n-Broc', which has been held each September in Minneapolis since 1998. Throughout the 2000s, there were various competitions held throughout the United States, many of which were held at Bandon Dunes in Bandon, Oregon. =World championships= 2012 ‚Äì Inaugural World Championships The inaugural Speed Golf World Championships were held October 20‚Äì21, 2012 at Bandon Dunes Golf Resort in Bandon, Oregon on the Old MacDonald Course (October 20) and the Bandon Dunes Course (October 21).

Smith shot 65 in just 44:06 while carrying six clubs for a speed golf score of 109:06.http://www.christophersmithgolf.com Related sports Speed golf is sometimes contrasted with Cross-country BigBall, in which players use soccer balls and baseball bats to reach a goal. Because the course and goals are chosen by the participants, Cross-country BigBall etiquette varies depending on whether the theater is a wooded or residential area. Both sports require substantial physical stamina. Speed disc golf is similar in concept and rules to speed golf. The biathlon (skiing and shooting a rifle) is also sometimes compared to speed golf.

It was originally formed in 1912 and is based in the capital city of Zagreb. The organisation is a member of both FIFA and UEFA, and is responsible for overseeing all aspects of the game of football in Croatia. Its current president is Davor ≈†uker. The HNS sanctions all competitive football matches in Croatia, either directly, beginning with the 3. HNL on down, or indirectly through the associations of professional football clubs, who manage 1. HNL and 2. HNL, the first and second divisions of Croatia, respectively, as well as the Croatian Cup. It is also responsible for appointing the management of the men's, women's and youth national football teams. As of 2009, the HNS had 118,316 registered players (650 of them professionals) and a total of 1,732 registered association football and futsal clubs. History =Early years (1912‚Äì1945)= The organisation traces its roots to the Croatian Sports Federation (Hrvatski ≈°portski savez), which was founded on 8 October 1909 in Zagreb, at the time when Croatia was part of Austria‚ÄìHungary. The federation organised all sports in the country and its first president was Hinko W√ºrth, the chairman of HA≈†K football club. Present-day HNS considers its foundation date to be 13 June 1912, when the football section of the Croatian Sports Federation was established, and its head, Milovan Zoriƒçiƒá, as its first president. After World War I and the dissolution of Austria‚ÄìHungary, representatives from Graƒëanski, HA≈†K, Hajduk Split and Concordia football clubs met in Zagreb on 14 April 1919 and founded the Football Association of Yugoslavia (Jugoslavenski nogometni savez), as a successor of the Croatian Sports Federation's football section, and appointed Hinko W√ºrth as its president. The organization then became the chief governing body of football in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and launched the Yugoslav First League, the first country-wide national competition held initially in a cup format. Five other regional sub-federations were also created (based in Belgrade, Ljubljana, Sarajevo, Split and Subotica), each organizing their own regional tournaments with winners qualifying for the national championship. In 1929, following disagreements between the Zagreb and Belgrade sub-federations, the Football Association of Yugoslavia was dissolved. It was then re- established in May 1930 in Belgrade, this time with the Serbian-language name Fudbalski savez Jugoslavije. The Belgrade-based association then continued organizing the national league until 1939, when the Banovina of Croatia was created as an administrative region within Kingdom of Yugoslavia. On 6 August 1939 the Croatian Football Federation (Hrvatski nogometni savez or CFF) was established as a football governing body in the newly created province, and Croatian and Slovenian clubs soon began leaving the Yugoslav League to join the CFF-run Croatian-Slovenian Football League in protest of the alleged centralization of sports around Belgrade. The split was eventually rectified with the promise of an increase in the number of Croatian and Slovenian clubs in the league, and because of this a shortened ten-round league was played in the 1939‚Äì40 Yugoslav First League season. In 1940 CFF also played a part in organizing the first ever Croatia national football team matches which played four international friendlies between April and December 1940. However the federation was not yet recognized by FIFA as Croatia was at the time still a province of Yugoslavia. In April 1941 Kingdom of Yugoslavia was invaded by Axis Powers and was effectively dissolved. However, the Croatian Football Federation continued to run a competition called the Croatian national football league in the territory of Independent State of Croatia (NDH), a fascist puppet state which enjoyed relative peace during World War II, and which included most of present-day countries of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 17 July 1941 CFF was admitted to FIFA as the top level federation of NDH, and the national team representing NDH played fourteen international matches in the period from 1941 to 1944. =CFF in Yugoslavia (1945‚Äì1990)= Following the end of World War II, Croatia became a part of SFR Yugoslavia and the Belgrade-based Football Association of Yugoslavia took over as the main football-governing body in the country. Also, the new communist government issued a decree in 1945 which effectively dissolved all football clubs which were active during the war as a form of punishment for their participation in the fascist-run football championship. Among others, Zagreb- based powerhouses Concordia, HA≈†K and Graƒëanski all ceased to exist, their property was nationalised, and several other clubs, most notably Dinamo Zagreb, were formed to take their place. On the other hand, Hajduk Split was spared as their players had escaped from their Italian-occupied home city of Split during World War II and joined Yugoslav Partisans in 1944. For this reason, Hajduk Split is the only major Croatian club which can claim continuity since its foundation in 1911. In the period from 1945 to 1990 the Belgrade-based Yugoslav Football Federation was in charge of football in the entire country, while Zagreb was turned into its major regional hub and administrative branch. In this period Croatian clubs competed within the Yugoslav league system and Croatian players were eligible for the Yugoslavia national football team. In the following decades Dinamo Zagreb and Hajduk Split became two of the Yugoslav Big Four (along with Belgrade-based Partizan and Red Star), a quartet of clubs which significantly dominated football in communist Yugoslavia. Dinamo and Hajduk won a combined total of 11 Yugoslav First League titles and 16 Yugoslav Cups. In addition, Croatian club Rijeka won 2 Yugoslav Cup titles. Dinamo Zagreb also won the 1966‚Äì67 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, which made them the first Yugoslav side to win a continental competition, and were the only Yugoslav club with European silverware until Red Star's 1990‚Äì91 European Cup win 24 years later. =Modern era (1990‚Äìpresent)= When the breakup of Yugoslavia began to unfold in the early 1990s, the political situation was reflected on football pitches. On 13 May 1990 an infamous riot occurred at Maksimir in Zagreb and interrupted the Dinamo Zagreb ‚Äì Red Star league fixture. On 3 June 1990 the pre-scheduled Yugoslavia‚ÄìNetherlands friendly was held at the same stadium, and some 20,000 Croatian fans booed the Yugoslav national anthem and cheered for the Dutch team instead. On 26 September 1990 Hajduk Split fans staged a violent pitch invasion at Poljud during a league fixture against Partizan. On 17 October 1990 the first match of the newly established Croatia national football team was held, a friendly against the United States, and following the end of the 1990‚Äì91 season Croatian clubs decided to abandon Yugoslav competitions. After Croatia had officially declared independence on 8 October 1991, the Croatian Football Federation sought international recognition, and was finally re- admitted to FIFA on 3 July 1992 and to UEFA on 17 June 1993. In February 1992 the inaugural season of the Croatian top league Prva HNL kicked off, and in March 1992 the first edition of the Croatian Cup was launched. In late 2010, the Federation held an election for its President, with Vlatko Markoviƒá opposed by Igor ≈†timac. Markoviƒá won by a single vote, and the assembly was marred with controversies. ≈†timac later appealed, calling for another meeting of the Federation. His supporters organized a new assembly and elected him the new President despite the opposing faction's boycott, leading to an impasse. In July 2012, the Federation held an election for its President, with Davor ≈†uker as the only candidate. All 46 delegates voted in favour of Suker's candidature. Presidents ;Notes *The first three presidents 1912‚Äì1919 were heads of football sections within the Croatian Sports Federation, the top sports governing body in Croatia, which was at the time a province within Austria-Hungary. Following World War I and the formation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia the organisation was re-established in Zagreb in 1919 as the Football Association of Yugoslavia and designed as a national-level governing body. Its seat was moved to Yugoslavia's capital Belgrade ten years later in 1929. Although city-level subfederations continued to exist in the 1920s and 1930s there was no separate regional organisation which would govern the sport in Croatia between 1919 and 1939, hence the 20-year gap. *In 1939 the Banovina of Croatia was created as an autonomous province within Yugoslavia, and a new provincial federation carrying the present-day football federation's name was established. Ivo Kraljeviƒá headed this body between 1939 and 1941. *Following the April 1941 invasion of Yugoslavia the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), an Axis-allied puppet state which included most of the territories of present- day Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, was established. The Zagreb-based football federation thus began to govern football in the entire territory of NDH and continued to organize national-level league championships during World War II. During this period NDH was admitted to FIFA and organised 14 international friendlies involving Croatia. Presidents between 1941 and 1945 headed the CFF during this era. *After 1945 and the establishment of the communist SFR Yugoslavia, the CFF again became one of its regional federations, charged with governing football in SR Croatia, which became one of Yugoslavia's six federal republics. Presidents from 1945‚Äì1990 headed the CFF in this period. *After Croatia proclaimed independence in 1991 and the breakup of Yugoslavia the CFF became the top football governing body of the newly independent nation. The country was internationally recognized by early 1992, and CFF was admitted to FIFA (again) in July 1992 and to UEFA in June 1993. ;List of presidents (1912‚Äì1990) *Milovan Zoriƒçiƒá (1912‚Äì1914) *Vladimir Oƒçiƒá (1914) *Milan Graf (1914‚Äì1919) *Ivo Kraljeviƒá (1939‚Äì1941) *Rudolf Hitrec (1941‚Äì1942) *Vatroslav Petek (1942‚Äì1944) *Rinaldo ƒåuliƒá (1944‚Äì1945) *Mijo Hr≈°ak (1945‚Äì1947) *Lazo Vraƒçariƒá (1947‚Äì1950) *Boris Bakraƒç (1950‚Äì1953) *Vlado Ranogajec (1953‚Äì1957) *Mirko Oklobd≈æija (1957‚Äì1959) *Pero Splivalo (1959‚Äì1965) *Luka Bajakiƒá (1965‚Äì1966) *Bruno Kne≈æeviƒá (1966‚Äì1971) *Ivan Koliƒá (1971‚Äì1976) *Vlado Bogatec (1976‚Äì1978) *Ljubo ≈†panjol (1978‚Äì1981) *≈Ωeljko Huber (1981‚Äì1982) *Du≈°an Veselinoviƒá (1982‚Äì1984) *Milivoj Ra≈æov (1984‚Äì1985) *Adam Su≈°anj (1985‚Äì1986) *Antun ƒÜiliƒá (1986‚Äì1988) *Pa≈°ko Viƒëak (1988‚Äì1990) ;List of presidents (1990‚Äìpresent) *Mladen Vedri≈° (September 1990 ‚Äì July 1994) *Damir Matovinoviƒá (acting, 8 July 1994 ‚Äì 10 March 1995) *ƒêuro Brodarac (10 March 1995 ‚Äì 8 June 1995) *Nadan Vido≈°eviƒá (8 June 1995 ‚Äì 17 August 1996) *Josip ≈†oiƒá (17 August 1996 ‚Äì 2 June 1997) *Branko Mik≈°a (2 June 1997 ‚Äì 5 October 1998) *Vlatko Markoviƒá (18 December 1998 ‚Äì 5 July 2012) *Davor ≈†uker (5 July 2012 ‚Äì present) Competitions It organizes the following competitions: ;Men's football: * 1.

It began as a political party representing ultra-Orthodox Jews in Poland, originating in the Agudath Israel movement in Upper Silesia. It later became the Party of many Haredim in Israel. It was the umbrella party for many, though not all, Haredi Jews in Israel until the 1980s, as it had been during the British Mandate of Palestine. Since the 1980s, it has become a predominately Hasidic party, though it often combines with the Degel HaTorah non-Hasidic Haredi party for elections and coalition-forming. When so combined, they are known together as United Torah Judaism. History Kashrut Badatz of Agudat Yisrael When political Zionism began to emerge in the 1890s, and recruit supporters in Europe and America, it was opposed by many Orthodox Jews, who believed the Jewish state would emerge from divine intervention. World Agudath Israel was founded in Kattowitz, German Empire (now Katowice, Poland), in 1912, with the purpose of providing an umbrella organization for observant Jews who opposed the Zionist movement. In Palestine, Agudat Yisrael was established as a branch of this movement, to provide opposition to the organised Zionist Jewish community (the \\"New Yishuv\\", as opposed to the traditionalist, religious \\"Old Yishuv\\"). One of its most authoritative spokesmen against the formation of a Jewish State, the Dutch poet Jacob Isra√´l de Haan, was assassinated by the Haganah in 1924. In 1933, it entered into an agreement with the Jewish Agency in Palestine, according to which Agudat Yisrael would receive 6.5% of the immigration permits.\\"Agudat Yisrael\\" in Answers.com In the wake of the Holocaust, anti-Zionist rabbis who led Agudat Israel recognised the great utility of a Jewish state, and it became non-Zionist, rather than anti- Zionist. It did not actively participate in the creation of Israel, but it ceased its opposition to it. Eventually, at the eve of the Israeli Declaration of Independence (1948), Agudat Yisrael yielded to pressure from the Zionist movement, and has been a participant in most governments since that time.Aguddat Israel in Jewish Virtual Library The movement realised the benefits of more active participation in politics over time, and agreed to become a coalition partner in several Israeli governments. However, its original reservations about a secular government influenced its decision to refuse cabinet positions. Agudat Yisrael originally had a mix of Hasidic and \\"Litvish\\" (Lithuanian-style Haredi) membership. However, in the 1980s, Rabbi Elazar Shach, leader of Israel's Litvish community and their pre-eminent rosh yeshiva (\\"yeshiva dean\\"), split from the party. He created the new Degel HaTorah (\\"Flag of the Torah\\") party. Most of the Litvish community left Agudah to join Degel HaTorah, leaving Agudah with primarily Hasidic members. Rabbi Shach had earlier assisted Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef in splitting from Agudah to create a Sephardic Haredi party known as Shas. Agudat Yisrael and Degel HaTorah have not always agreed with each other about policy matters; however, over the years, the two parties have co-operated and united as a voting bloc in order to win the maximum number of seats in the Knesset, since many extra votes can be wasted if certain thresholds are not attained under Israel's proportional representation parliamentary system. The two parties chose to function and be listed under the name of United Torah Judaism (UTJ, Hebrew Yahadut HaTorah). When both parties joined the government coalition of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in 2004, the UTJ union was broken due to rivalries. For the 2006 Israel legislative election, Agudat Yisrael and Degel HaTorah once again put their differences aside, and have officially revived their United Torah Judaism alliance in order to win the maximum number of seats in the 17th Knesset. Though Agudat Yisrael has never elected more than ten members in the Knesset, it has often played crucial roles in the formation of Israel's coalition governments because Israel's system of proportional representation allows small parties to wield the balance of power between the larger parties. This political leverage has been used to obtain funding for yeshivas and community institutions, to obtain a de facto exemption for Haredi Yeshiva students from military service, and to pass legislation regarding observance of the Shabbat and kashrut (\\"dietary\\") laws, sometimes to the consternation of secular Israelis. Religious and political leadership Political power is vested in the Hasidic Rebbes of Boston, Ger, Vizhnitz, and Belz. In addition, policy decisions of Agudat Yisrael are ratified by its Council of Torah Sages, which includes several other prominent Hasidic leaders and scholars, many being the leading rabbis from the main constituent groups. When participating in government coalitions, the party generally refrains from accepting actual cabinet posts. Its positions on Israeli foreign policy and the Palestinian question has been flexible in the past, since the party formally rejects political secular Zionism and does not view such issues ideologically. Therefore, it has been able to participate in both Likud- and Labor-led coalitions. In more recent years, it has become more sympathetic to the settler movement in the West Bank, and thus more security-conscious on military issues affecting Israel's survival. Agudat Yisrael supported Ariel Sharon's unilateral disengagement plan of 2005. In 1948, Rabbi Yehuda Meir Abramowicz was appointed as General Secretary. Rabbi Meir Porush, as well as Yaakov Litzman, and Yisrael Eichler, from the Hasidic courts of Ger and Belz, respectively, have represented the party in Israel's Knesset. Another long- time Agudat MK is Rabbi Shmuel Halpert, a member of the court of Vizhnitz.

Saint Mary was also one of the first sections of the island to be occupied by the Spaniards. Puerto Santa Maria was the second town the Spaniards built on the island. In 1655, after the English captured Jamaica from the Spanish, the north coastal town of Santa Maria became known as Port Maria. One of St. Mary‚Äôs most famous early residents was Sir Henry Morgan, who had a home on the hill overlooking Port Maria. The property offered a commanding view of the St. Mary harbour and provided Morgan with a strategic vantage point and featured a secret escape tunnel to Port Maria.. Morgan in Port Maria Morgan‚Äôs home was later purchased by Sir No√´l Coward and is located beside Fort Haldane. Cannon at Fort Haldane Fort Haldane was built in 1759 to protect the strategic harbour of Port Maria from Spanish raids. It was also used as a garrison to keep the enslaved and working classes of St. Mary under control.http://jamaica- gleaner.com/gleaner/20101008/lead/lead4.html History of Fort Haldane It was named after General George Haldane, then Governor of Jamaica. The fort‚Äôs cannons were strategically positioned on a hill facing seaward over Port Maria for protection. Fort Haldane served a pivotal role in the famous Tacky's rebellion, one of Jamaica's bloodiest rebellions against slavery in 1760. On Easter Sunday, a runaway slave known as Tacky and a small group of slaves from neighboring plantations murdered their masters and marched to Port Maria where they killed the guards at Fort Haldane and stole several barrels of gunpowder and firearms. They fought alongside hundreds of other slaves for five months but their rebellion was ultimately quashed by the far more powerful British and the skilled Jamaican Maroons from Scott's Hall (Jamaica). A Maroon officer from Scott's Hall, Davy the Maroon, shot Tacky dead following a fierce gunbattle.https://archive.org/stream/cu31924020417527/cu31924020417527_djvu.txt Tacky‚Äôs Rebellion Descendants of the Maroons carried on their struggle after the abolition of slavery and they joined with Reverend James Phillippo in his quest to establish one of his Free Villages in St. Mary. Phillippo built the first church in Oracabessa and led a defiant protest against the local landowner‚Äôs refusal to sell land to former slaves. The Maroons joined Phillippo in a show of force that led to the landowner‚Äôs capitulation and the sale of enough land to build homes for the local population.Masters, P., 2006: Missionary triumph over slavery. Wakeman Trust, London. . pp. 15-16 St. Mary's present size was determined in 1867, when the parish of Metcalfe was merged with St Mary.

The eastern perimeter of the Oracabessa Bay Fish Sanctuary is located on the edge of the Cayman Trough with walls that begin at 60 ft. and drop down to over 150 ft. These walls are covered in a large variety of hard and soft corals. The walls contain many overhangs and ledges and are home to lobsters, king crab, green and spotted moray eels, and a host of other marine creatures.

It is bordered by Portland in the east, St. Ann in the west, and parts of St. Catherine and St. Andrew in the south. The parish covers an area of 610 km¬≤, making it Jamaica's fifth smallest parish. The terrain is mountainous, rising up to almost at the highest point, but there are no distinctive mountain ranges. The climate is varied, like most parishes on the island. The eastern section of the parish has shale rock and an intricate surface draining pattern, while the western section is limestone with predominantly underground rivers. There are three main rivers in Saint Mary, the Rio Nuevo, Wag Water River and White River. Commerce The parish has a good variety of agricultural resources. The principal products are bananas, sugar, citrus, pimento, cocoa, coconuts, coffee, vegetables, breadfruit and anatto. Pastoralism is also practised. In recent years, however, agriculture has been on the decline, which may be due to the problems that Jamaican banana export has been facing. St. Mary's parish, had once been listed as one of the poorest in Jamaica, but over the past 10 years there have been substantial improvements in the economy due to the influx of investments in infrastructure, including a new international airport (Ian Fleming International Airport), a new highway, and development of luxury resorts such as Goldeneye and Golden Clouds. The new intercoastal highway constructed in 2005 has benefitted the parish and has brought a significant increase to tourism-related activities.

He was blessed by Yama to the couple. Yudhishthira is the first among the five Pandavas. In the epic, he becomes the emperor of Indraprastha and later of Hastinapura (Kuru). From his childhood, Yudhishthira was greatly influenced by Vidura and Bhishma, and believed in Dharma. He was trained in politics by Kripa and spear fighting by Drona. Later, he was appointed as the crowned prince of Hastinapura but was replaced by Duryodhana Because of Kunti's misunderstanding, Yudhishthira and his brothers were married to Draupadi. Dhritarashtra divided his kingdom to end the succession dispute between Yudhishthira and Duryodhana. The eldest son of Pandu was given a barren land to rule, but he developed the magnificent city of Indraprastha. After he performed Rajasuya, he became the emperor and was invited to play Pachisi, a game of dice by his jealous cousin, Duryodhana and his uncle, Shakuni. There Yudhishthira gambled his kingdom, fame, wealth, his brothers and even himself. Finally, he gambled Draupadi. After the game and the Pandavas and Draupadi were sent on an exile for thirteen years. During his exile, he was tested by Yama. For incognito, Yudhishthira disguised himself as Kanka and served the king of Matsya Kingdom. Yudhishthira was the leader of the successful Pandava side in the Kurukshetra War and defeated many warriors including Shalya. At the end of the epic, he was the only one among his brothers to ascend to heaven with his mortal body. His only sin was a half-lie spoken during the 15th day of the Mahabharata war. He was also blessed with the spiritual vision of second sight by a celestial Rishi as a boon. Etymology Statue of Yudhishthira The word Yudhishthira means \\"the one who is steady in the war\\", from the words, yuddha (‡§Ø‡•Å‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß) meaning 'war', and sthira (‡§∏‡•ç‡§•‡§ø‡§∞) meaning 'steady'.

Birth and Upbringing Pandu Shoots the Ascetic Kindama Once a Brahmin rishi, Kindama and his wife were enjoying nature in the forest when Yudhishthira's father Pandu accidentally shot at them, mistaking them for deer. Before dying, Kindama cursed the king to die when he engages in intercourse with any woman. Due to this curse, Pandu was unable to become father. As an additional penance for the murder, Pandu abdicated the throne of Hastinapura, and his blind brother Dhritarashtra took over the reins of the kingdom. After knowing the curse of Pandu, Kunti told him that he could be the father of the child and told her boon of sage Durvasa. Then Pandu requested Kunti to apply her boon and suggested to call Dharma to get a truthful, knowledgeable and justice knowing son who can rule Hastinapur. On the full moon of May (Sanskrit: Jyeshth masa) first and the eldest of the Pandavas, Yudhishthira was born. Yudhishthira's four younger brothers were Bhima, (born by invoking Vayu); Arjuna, (born by invoking Indra); and the twins Nakula and Sahadeva (born by invoking A≈õvins). If Karna, the son of Kunti born before her marriage by invoking Surya is counted, Yudhishthira would be the second-eldest of Kunti's children. Yudhishthira was trained in religion, science, administration and military arts by the Kuru preceptors, Kripa and Drona. Specifically, he became a master in using the spear and war chariot. It is said that his spear was so strong that it could penetrate a stone wall as though it were a piece of paper. His chariot always flew at a 4 finger distance above the ground due to his piety. Marriage and children Yudhishthira had two wives, Draupadi and Devika. After Yudhishthira and his brothers had completed their studies, they returned to Hastinapura. Duryodhana along with Shakuni planned to kill them and sent Yudhishthira, his siblings and his mother to a palace made of lac, called Lakshagriha. One night, Shakuni's man, Purochana set fire. However, princes and their mother survived. They were heartbroken and decided to hide from Hastinapura. Later, Arjuna attended Draupadi's swayamvar and won her hand in marriage. But due to Kunti's misunderstanding, Draupadi became the common wife of all the Pandavas. Later at Indraprastha, Draupadi bore Yudhishthira a son, Prativindhya. Although Yudhishthira had another wife named Devika, Draupadi was his chief consort as well as the empress. Yudhishthira was married to Devika in a self-choice marriage ceremony, arranged by her father Govasena, who was the king of Sivi Kingdom. They had a son, Yaudheya. According to Puranas, Yaudheya was also the name of the son of Prativindhya.https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/yaudheya The Bhagavata Purana, as well as Vishnu Purana, also mention Pauravi as one of the wives of Yudhishthira. A son named Devaka was born to this couple.https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/devaka Ruling the Indraprastha =Division of Hastinapura= When Pandavas returned to Hastinapura after hiding, there was conflict between Yudhishthira and Duryodhana regarding as the crown prince of Hastinapura. Yudhishthira was originally made the crown prince of Hastinapura, but after the event of Lakshagriha, people thought that he was dead, and Duryodhana was made the new crown prince of Hastinapura. On Bhishma's advice, Dhritarashtra gave half of the kingdom to Pandavas to rule. However the land was under the control of Takshaka. Pandavas defeated Takshaka and with the help of Mayasura, they built a magnificent city named Indraprastha.https://steemit.com/mgsc/@amarsingh1/hastinapur-will-be- surprised-by-the-secret-of-the-city-of-mahabharata =Rajasuya Yagna= King Yudhishthira Performs the Rajasuya Sacrifice Some years after his coronation at Indraprastha, Yudhishthira set out to perform the Rajasuya yagna. Arjuna, Bhima, Nakula, and Sahadeva led armies across the four corners of the world to obtain tributes from all kingdoms for Yudhishthira's sacrifice. The non- compliant Magadha king, Jarasandha was defeated by Bhima and Krishna. At his sacrifice, Yudhishthira chose Krishna as his honoured guest. At the yajna, many kings were present there, including Duryodhana and Shishupala. Shishupala was beheaded by Krishna for his evil deeds. An annoyed and jealous Duryodhana returned to Hastinapura. The game of dice Yudhishthira was challenged to play a game of dice in Hastinapura by his cousin, Duryodhana. He invited him, because he was jealous of Yudhishthira's wealth and power after he witnessed at the Rajasuya. Shakuni used the dice made from the bones of his father, which always ensured that he got the number he wanted and Yudhisthira was allowed to bet whatever he had he was proud of and had right over. After losing his brothers and his empire, he bet himself and also his wife which lead to the Vastraharan. Later, he lost all his kingdom in the game again and was forced into exile for 13 years, which included one year in anonymity.  Exile  =Yaksha Prashna= Yudhisthira answering the questions of Yaksha During their exile, the 4 other Pandavas happened upon a lake, which was haunted by a Yaksha. The Yaksha challenged the brothers to answer his moral questions before drinking the water; the four Pandavas laughed and drank the water anyway. As a result, they choked on the water and died. Yudhishthira went in last, answered many questions put forth to him by the Yaksha and revived his brothers. He asked for any other wish as he was impressed and told him he could ask for wealth, strength, power, anything he wished. Yudhishthira said he already got the strength, wealth and power when all his four brothers were revived and said he could not ask for any other wish. Sahadeva said if you do not use this wish, we might be in trouble in the future. Arjuna knowing that his brother Sahadeva knows the future told Yudhishthira to ask another wish. Bhima and Nakula also knew that Sahadeva and Arjuna were very smart and told him to use his wish. Later Yama, his father told him to ask for a wish. Yudhishthira said, \\"Asking for 1 or 2 boons is not being greedy but asking for 3 or more boons is being greedy and it is one of the gravest sins. My brothers are insisting me to ask for a wish and the person who is ready to give me a boon, my father also wants me to ask for another boon. I do not ask for being the wealthiest man nor being the most powerful man. All I ask is that me, my brothers and Draupadi should not be recognized during the 13th year of exile.\\"This story is often cited as an example of Yudhishthira's upright principles. The Yaksha later identified himself as Yudhishthira's father, Dharma and pointed them to the kingdom of Matsya to spend their last year in exile anonymously. = AgyatvƒÅsa (Incognito) = Along with his brothers, Yudhishthira spent his last year of exile in the kingdom of Matsya. He disguised himself as a Brahmin named Kank (among themselves Pandavas called him Jaya) and taught the game of dice to the king. Kurukshetra War When the period of exile was completed, Duryodhana refused to return Yudhishthira's kingdom. Yudhishthira made numerous diplomatic efforts to retrieve his kingdom peacefully but in vain. He was convinced by Krishna to wage war. The flag of Yudhishthira's chariot bore the image of a golden Moon with planets around it. Two large and beautiful kettle-drums, called Nanda and Upananda, were tied to it. Before the war started, Yudhisthira stepped down from his chariot to take blessings firm his grandsire Bhishma, teachers Drona and Kripa and uncle Shalya, who all were in his opposite side in the war showing his respect towards his elders. He also asked the willing Kauravas to join his side. On his request one of Dhritrasthara sons, Yuyutsu joined the war on the side of Pandavas. Yudhishthira was described to be an excellent car-warrior and a master at spear-fighting. Yudhishthira defeated many warriors in the War, such as Srutayudha and Duryodhana .He killed Madra king Shalya and his brother on the 18th and final day on the War. Reign after the war Yudhisthira arrives in Hastinapur at the end of war After getting victory in the war, Yudhisthira was crowned as the Emperor of Hastinapura for 36 years. He performed Ashwamedha on Krishna and Vyasa's insistence. In this sacrifice, a horse was released to wander for a year, and Yudhisthira's brother Arjuna led the Pandava army, following the horse. The kings of all the countries where the horse wandered were asked to submit to Yudhisthira's rule or face war. All paid tribute, once again establishing Yudhisthira as the undisputed Emperor of Bharat Varsh. Retirement and Ascent To Heaven Yudhishthira and His Dog, Ascending Upon the onset of the Kali-yuga and the departure of Krishna, Yudhishthira and his brothers retired, leaving the throne to their only descendant to survive the war of Kurukshetra, Arjuna's grandson, Parikshit. Giving up all their belongings and ties, the Pandavas, accompanied by a dog, made their final journey of pilgrimage to the Himalayas. Among the Pandavas and Draupadi, one-by-one died on the way to reach the top, starting from Draupadi. Finally, it was Yudhisthira who was able to reach the top, with the dog accompanying him. On reaching the top, Indra asked him to abandon the dog before entering the Heaven. But Yudhishthira refused to do so, citing the dog's unflinching loyalty as a reason. Indra said he let his family die, but Yudhishthira said he could not prevent their deaths, but to abandon a poor creature was a great sin. It turned out that the dog was his god-father Dharma Deva in disguise. He then went to heaven and found his Kaurava cousins but not his brothers and Draupadi. He asked Yamraj about this. Yamraj took him to hell and told him of the sins of Pandavas and their wife. Yudhishtir decides that he would rather live in hell with good people than in heaven with bad people. This is another test and after this the Pandavas and Draupadi attain heaven. There are three other stories relating to whether Yudhishtir went to heaven or hell. In the first story he attains hell. While the Pandavas and Draupadi are walking to heaven, Draupadi and his brothers die one by one but Yudhishtir does not look back. He feels as if he has left all his mortal ties by not doing so. When he reaches heaven and does not find Draupadi and his brothers there but finds his Kaurava cousins he asks Yamraj angrily about his brothers and wife. Yamraj takes him to hell and tells him about his family's sins. Yudhishtir gets angry as he feels the sins of his family to be small compared to the sins of his cousins. Yamraj tells him that since he has not renounced mortal ties and is still angry at his cousins, he has attained hell. In the second story he attains heaven. He reaches heaven and asks Yamraj about his brothers and Draupadi politely and asks about his cousins as well. Yamraj takes him to hell and tells him of his family's sins. Yamraj tells Yudhishtir that he too had to had to experience hell once for his lie or half lie to Drona about Ashwathama's death. Other's believe it was because he hesitated to lie and thought of human rather than universal Dharma. Yamraj assures Yudhishtir that his brothers and Draupadi will join him in heaven once they have atoned for their sins. In the third story Yudhishtir attains heaven. He himself tells his brothers and Draupadi of their sins. When he has to go through hell he only questions how long he has to be there. He knew his sin. He eventually attains heaven with his brothers and Draupadi. =Yudhishthira's Curse= After he was made aware that Karna was his elder brother, Yudhishthira cursed all women with not being able to hide any secrets. Had Yudhishthira's mother Kunti not kept that fact a secret, the war might have been averted, with millions spared. Skills He was master in spear-fighting and chariot racing. Yudhishthira was a polyglot, knowing unusual languages. He was known for his honesty, justice, sagacity, tolerance, good behavior and discernment. Dhritarashtra said to Sanjaya \\"The son of Kunti and Pandu, Yudhishthira, is virtuous and brave and eschews deeds that bring on shame. Endued with great energy, he hath been wronged by Duryodhana. If he were not high-minded, they would in wrath burn the Dhritarashtras. I do not so much dread Arjuna or Bhima or Krishna or the twin brothers as I dread the wrath of the king, O Suta, when his wrath is excited. His austerities are great; he is devoted to Brahmacharya practices. His heart's wishes will certainly be fulfilled. When I think of his wrath, O Sanjaya, and consider how just it is, I am filled with alarm.\\" Yudhishthira acquired deep spiritual knowledge from Lord Shiva and many prominent sages including Vyasa, Parashurama, Bhrigu, Savarni Manu, Narada, Markandeya, Asita Devala and Dhaumya.

It resulted from a court decision in 2004 to force the closure of the Orange Grove shopping centre after a zoning dispute, with the loss of approximately 200 jobs. Westfield, who owned a nearby shopping centre, had challenged the legitimacy of the Orange Grove centre, which was operating on land not zoned for this purpose. When the courts ruled in Westfield's favour, Liverpool City Council sought State Government approval for a retrospective rezoning, to validate its earlier decision to approve the shopping centre. The State Government declined to intervene, despite a planning report suggesting that course of action, and the retail component of the Orange Grove centre was forced to close. The bulky goods component of the centre remained open, as the centre was legally zoned for bulky goods sales. However, the state Opposition subsequently unearthed information about a meeting between Premier Bob Carr's chief of staff and a prominent Westfield employee, sparking allegations that interference from Westfield had played a role in the government's decision not to intervene. As a result, a parliamentary inquiry was commissioned, and the Independent Commission Against Corruption announced an investigation. The investigation concluded in 2005, with no findings of corruption against any person. However, the Commission recommended that the NSW Government strengthen guidelines for public servants dealing with corruption allegations by lobbyists. Unlike Nick Greiner in 1992 and Barry O'Farrell in 2014, the Orange Grove affair marked the only time that a sitting Premier in Bob Carr had survived appearing before ICAC although Carr did retire mere months after the conclusion of ICAC's investigation of the Orange Grove affair. Background In March 2002, Frank Mosca, an architect working on behalf of Sydney businessman Nabil Gazal, applied to change an existing development consent for a property in a light industrial area on Orange Grove Road in the Sydney suburb of Warwick Farm, just north of central Liverpool to change the permitted use of the site from \\"bulky goods/ warehousing\\" to \\"warehouse clearance outlet\\". This was intended to permit the building of an \\"outlet mall\\", mainly consisting of retailing, although described as \\"factory outlets\\", even though the area was zoned under its Local Environment Plan (LEP) for industrial uses, in which retailing was generally forbidden, except for a limited range of \\"bulky goods\\" or goods produced on the premises. The zoning was consistent with a long-standing policy of discouraging retailing away from established centres with good transport connections, currently embodied as a draft State Environmental Planning Policy: Integration of Land Use and Transport (SEPP 66). The Orange Grove site had poor bus connections only and none on Sundays. In due course Council officers advised that a new development application was required, and this was submitted on 5 June. On 13 June the Council wrote to Mosca clearly stating what retailing activities could be carried out on the site according to the LEP. Mr Mosca submitted a Statement of Environmental Effects in July, which argued that \\"warehouse clearance outlets\\" were not specifically prohibited by the LEP, and therefore Council could consent to them. The development application was eventually advertised for public comment in November and no comments having been received it was decided that under Council rules it could be approved at officer level, without reference to a Council committee. Immediately following the end of the comment period on 15 December, an officer of Liverpool City Council approved the development application, apparently satisfied that \\"warehouse clearance outlets\\" were not forbidden by the LEP. Prior to the approval, the Orange Centre commenced trading in November, with Craig Knowles, the local member and state Planning Minister, attending the official opening. Legal action On 17 June 2003, the Westfield Group, which operates a large shopping centre elsewhere in Liverpool, commenced legal action in the Land and Environment Court, arguing that a retail outlet operating out of an industrial zone was contrary to the Council's LEP. On 8 December, the Liverpool City Council decided to amend the LEP to introduce a new definition for \\"outlet centre\\" and retrospectively rezone the Orange Centre site. On 16 January 2004, the court ruled in favour of Westfield and ordered the closure of the centre's retail activities, with a deadline ultimately extended to 30 June. This verdict was subsequently upheld by the Court of Appeal on 31 March. While the dispute had been ongoing, the Carr government had sacked the strife-torn Liverpool council, after a series of incidents of economic mismanagement, and on 16 March, it appointed Gabrielle Kibble, the daughter of former Governor-General John Kerr, as administrator. On 14 April, Kibble forwarded an application for a retrospective rezoning as an amendment to the Liverpool Local Environment Plan (LEP) to the Minister Assisting the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning (Planning Administration), Diane Beamer, as required by planning legislation. Consideration of retrospective amendment to LEP On 15 April 2004, Mark Ryan, Director of Corporate Affairs, Westfield, phoned Premier Carr's Chief of Staff, Graeme Wedderburn and suggested that the original Liverpool City Council planning approval that had been overturned by the courts had been approved corruptly. Next day Wedderburn discussed these allegations with Carr. Apparently at his own initiative, Wedderburn then phoned Minister Beamer's Chief of Staff, Michael Meagher, and conveyed the allegations. He later phoned Beamer, and told her to \\"be wary of things that come out of Liverpool. There had been some allegations from Westfield.\\" On 19 April, Ryan met Wedderburn and gave more details of his claims about Liverpool City Council, but conceded that he had no hard evidence. Wedderburn told Beamer, at a meeting on 20 April, \\"You should be very careful, you should take great care not to be influenced, subject to any undue influence, not to be inappropriately lobbied in making this plan, in making decisions here\\", according to Meagher. Nevertheless, according to evidence subsequently presented at ICAC, Wedderburn made no suggestion as to what Beamer's decision on the proposed variation to the LEP should be. Neither Wedderburn nor Beamer made any effort to investigate whether the original decision was corrupt, which, in any event, had little bearing on the current process. During ICAC's subsequent investigations, it focused on whether these corruption allegation affected Bealmer's subsequent decision not to amend the LEP. On 16 June, the Department of Infrastructure, Planning and Natural Resources, advised Beamer to approve Liverpool City Council's proposed variation to its LEP that would have retrospectively validated the planning approval for the shopping centre. The Department's head, Jennifer Westacott, contradicted this recommendation in a memorandum signed on 25 June. Beamer's Chief of Staff, Michael Meagher, later told the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC),\\"‚Ä¶what we had was something I‚Äôd never seen before. It was highly unusual, and it was, I suppose confusing in a way too.\\" As the date for the centre's closure, set for mid-2004, drew closer, both sides increased the pressure. Westfield declared that an A$150 million redevelopment of its own centre was under threat if Orange Grove was allowed to continue operating, and suggested that Orange Grove could cause the loss of up to A$18 million a year from the local economy. After further discussions with Westacott and a further memorandum, Beamer declined to approve the proposed variation on the grounds that the shopping centre tended to undermine the viability of the Liverpool shopping centre, on 8 July 2004. Corruption allegations On 10 July 2004, Gazal, Orange Grove's owner, signed a statutory declaration alleging that he had been told by Labor member Joe Tripodi on 22 May that the retrospective approval would be denied by Beamer. Furthermore, he alleged that Tripodi had told him that Carr had directly instructed Beamer to reject the proposal after having contact with Westfield. In addition, Samir Bargshoon, a contract cleaner and friend of Gazal, signed a statutory declaration alleging that he had heard, on the same day, Tripodi say that Beamer had told him that Carr had instructed her not to sign the rezoning of the Liverpool designer outlets. Gazal's solicitor, Joseph D‚ÄôAgostino, also signed a statutory declaration containing an allegation that Tripodi had indicated that the planning issue was being handled \\"at a higher level then (sic) himself.\\" Mosca, the shopping centre's architect signed a statutory declaration alleging that Tripodi had said, in relation to the rezoning, \\"Carr rang Beamer and asked her to screw it over\\". Gazal's allegations received substantial media attention, and led to both the state opposition and the Sydney tabloid The Daily Telegraph becoming involved. It subsequently emerged that the Department of Infrastructure, Planning and Natural Resources submission to Minister Beamer had supported the rezoning of the centre, due to the number of jobs that would be lost if it were to close. Then Opposition Leader, John Brogden, tabled a draft press release in parliament that would have announced Beamer's decision to support Kibble's proposal. It also emerged that Mark Ryan, a senior Westfield lobbyist, had telephoned Graeme Wedderburn, the Premier's chief of staff, on 15 April 2003, two days after Kibble had publicly supported the rezoning. Wedderburn had then met Ryan and Craig Marshall, another Westfield executive, on 19 April. Though Wedderburn strongly defended his actions, he also publicly admitted that Orange Grove had been the focus of these meetings. Premier Carr, Wedderburn and Beamer all faced questions from the media over alleged links between the two events. ICAC investigation ICAC investigated these matters, holding public hearings from December 2004 to 23 March 2005 and reporting in August. It found that the original decision by Liverpool Council on the planning application was not corrupt. It found that Ryan's claims of corruption in the original decision were possibly \\"mischievous\\", but not corrupt. It did not consider that there was anything corrupt in the behaviour of Premier Carr, Wedderburn or Meagher. It scrutinised Westacott's advocacy but found no suggestion of impropriety. It concluded that Wedderburn's expression of concern about possible corruption in relation to the original decision by Liverpool Council had no significant effect on Minister Beamer's decision to reject the revised LEP, which could be justified on legitimate planning grounds. In relation to Tripodi, ICAC suggested that Tripodi might have been \\"content to be enlisted as the Gazcorp troubleshooter to perform a task which, in his opinion, was not difficult at all but which would raise his standing in the eyes of those who enlisted him\\", but when he lost confidence that Beamer would approve the proposed amendment of the LEP, he attempted on 22 May \\"to distance himself from this unfortunate result by ascribing to higher powers or to those with influence beyond his control the true cause of the likely rejection of the LEP amendment\\". ICAC found no evidence of corruption, but recommended that the NSW Government improve its guidelines on dealing with lobbyists. It also recommended that the Government adopt better protocols for ministers and their staff for dealing with allegations of corruption in relation to external parties. It noted that current guidelines were based on public service guidelines, and instructed ministerial staff to \\"report unethical behaviour or suspected corrupt to senior management\\", without explaining who \\"senior management\\" were. Finally, it recommended that the Government finalise State Environmental Planning Policy 66 - Integration of Land Use and Transport.

Nakula and Sahadeva were twins born to Madri, who had invoked the Ashwini Kumaras. Nakula and his brother Sahadeva, are both called as Ashvineya(‡§Ü‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§ø‡§®‡•á‡§Ø), as they were born from Ashvinas. Etymology and other names In Sanskrit, the word 'Nakula' means he who is most handsome in the lineage. The name Nakula generally means full of love and the male characteristics implied by the name are: Intelligence, Focus, Hard-Work, Handsomeness, Health, Attractiveness, Success, Popularity, Respect, and unconditional Love. Nakula and his brother Sahadeva, are both called as Ashvineya (‡§Ü‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§ø‡§®‡•á‡§Ø), as they were born from Ashvins. Birth and early years Due to Pandu's inability to bear children (because of the curse of Rishi Kindama), Kunti had to use the boon given by Sage Durvasa to give birth to her three children. She shared the boon with Pandu's second wife, Madri, who invoked the Ashwini Kumaras to beget Nakula and Sahadeva. Nakula was known to be the most handsome person in the Kuru lineage. In his childhood, Nakula mastered his skills in fencing and knife throwing under his father Pandu and a hermit named Suka at the Satasringa ashram. Later, Pandu lost his life when he attempted to make love with his wife, Madri. The latter also immolated herself in her husband's pyre (sati). Thus, Nakula along with his brothers moved to Hastinapura where he was brought up by Kunti. Kunti loved him as much as her own sons. Nakula greatly improved his archery and swordplay skills under the tutelage of Drona. Nakula turned out to be an accomplished wielder of the sword. Along with the other Pandava brothers, Nakula was trained in religion, science, administration, and military arts by the Kuru preceptors Kripacharya and Dronacharya. He was particularly skilled at horse-riding. Skills * Horse-keeping: Nakula's deep understanding of horse breeding and training is documented in the Mahabharata after the death of Narakasura by Krishna. In a conversation with Virata, Nakula claimed to know the art of treating all illnesses of horses. He was also a highly skilled charioteer. * Ayurveda: Being a son of the physicians, Ashwini Kumaras, Nakula was also believed to be an expert in Ayurveda. * Swordsman: Nakula was a brilliant swordsman and he showed his skills of sword while killing the sons of Karna on the 18th day of Kurukshetra war. Marriage and Children When the Pandavas and their mother, Kunti were in hiding after the event of Lakshagriha, Arjuna won Draupadi's hand in marriage. Nakula married her along with his brothers and had a son, Shatanika who was killed by Ashwatthama in the Kurukshetra War. He also married Karenumati, the daughter of Shishupala, who bore him one son, Niramitra. https://web.archive.org/web/20100116130453/http://www.sacred- texts.com/hin/m01/m01096.htm Niramitra became the king of Northern Madra Kingdom after his father Nakula. Conquest for Rajasuya Nakula's military expedition to the western kingdoms, as per epic Mahabharata.He seemed to have followed the Uttarapatha route. Nakula was sent west by Yudhisthira to subjugate kingdoms for the Rajasuya sacrifice, after crowning as the Emperor of Indraprastha. Nakula set forth to the kingdom once dominated by Vasudeva with a huge army. He first attacked the prosperous mountainous country of Rohitaka. He defeated the Mattamyurakas of the land in a fierce encounter. In another battle with the sage Akrosha, Nakula subjugated the regions of Sairishaka and Mahetta. He also defeated many tribes and small dynasties, including the Dasarnas, the Sivis, the Trigartas, the Amvashtas, the Malavas, the five tribes of the Karnatas, the Madhyamakeyas, the Vattadhanas and the Utsava-sanketas. Exile Yudhishthira's loss in the game of dice meant that all Pandavas had to live in exile for 13 years. Once in exile, Jatasura, disguised as a Brahmin, kidnapped Nakula along with Draupadi, Sahadeva and Yudhishthira. Bhima rescued them eventually and in the fight that ensued, Nakula killed Kshemankara, Mahamaha, and Suratha. In the 13th year, Nakula disguised himself as an ostler and assumed the name of Granthika (between themselves, the Pandavas called him Jayasena) at the Kingdom of Virata. He worked as a horse-trainer who looked after horses in the royal stable. Role in the Kurukshetra War Nakula in Javanese Wayang Nakula desired Drupada to be the general of the Pandava army, but Yudhishthira and Arjuna opted for Dhristadyumna. As a warrior, Nakula slew prominent war-heroes on the enemy side. The flag of Nakula's chariot bore the image of a red deer with golden back. Nakula was the leader of one of the seven Akshahuni. On the 1st day of the war, Nakula defeated Dussasana, sparing his life so that Bhima could fulfill his oath. On the 11th day, Nakula defeated Shalya, destroying his chariot. On the 13th day, his advance into Dronacharya's formation was repulsed by Jayadratha. On the 14th day, he defeated Shakuni. On the 15th day, he was defeated by Duryodhana but was rescued by Chekitana. On the 16th day, he was defeated and spared by Karna On the 17th day he killed Shakuni's son Vrikaasura and fulfilled his oath taken on the day of deciding the rules of war. On the 18th day of the war he killed three sons of Karna, Sushena, Chitrasena and Satyasena. Later life and death After the war, Yudhishthira appointed Nakula as the King of Northern Madra and Sahadeva as King of southern Madra.https://www.vyasaonline.com/encyclopedia/shalya/ Upon the onset of Kali Yuga and the departure of Krishna, the Pandavas retired. Giving up all their belongings and ties, the Pandavas and Draupadi, along with a dog, made their final journey of pilgrimage to the Himalayas. Except Yudhishthira, all of the Pandavas grew weak and died before reaching heaven. Nakula was third one to fall after Draupadi and Sahadeva. When Bhima asked Yudhishthira why Nakula fell, Yudhishthira replied that Nakula took pride on his beauty and believed that there was nobody equal to him in looks.http://www.sacred- texts.com/hin/m17/m17002.htm Reference Category:Characters in the Mahabharata ","title":"Nakula"},{"id":"1268183","text":"Potomac State College of West Virginia University is a junior college affiliated with West Virginia University and located in Keyser, West Virginia.

It was named after Edward, the Black Prince, a famous 14th century military leader. Development As a development from the Churchill, the Black Prince was a continuation of the line of Infantry tanks, that is slower, heavier tanks intended to operate in close support of infantry. It also was able to work closely with other tanks. The parallel development in British tank design were the Cruiser tanks, which were intended for more mobile operations. A43 was the General Staff Specification number issued in 1943, for an interim tank that would eventually be superseded by a \\"Universal tank\\" that would replace both Infantry and Cruiser tanks. The cruiser line led to the Cromwell tank (and the 17 pounder-armed Challenger variant) and then the Comet tank (which had a 77mm gun derived from the design of the 17 pounder). These tanks entered service during the war. While not as heavily protected as the Churchill, the Comet showed the way British tank development was going. This led to the last of the cruiser line and the first of the Universal tanks (now more widely known as Main Battle Tanks) - the very successful Centurion tank. A larger gun than that carried by a conventional Churchill required a larger turret on a wider turret ring and consequently a widening of the tank hull. The Black Prince weighed around ten tons more than the Churchill so the suspension was modified and the tracks widened by 10 inches to carry the extra load. However, the Churchill's engine was retained, leading to the tank being underpowered and slow, with maximum speeds on roads and cross country. This was so slow that the tank's tactical usefulness would have been limited. Consideration was given to the use of the Rolls-Royce Meteor engine; this would have increased the available power to , but the idea never left the drawing‚Äìboard. Likewise, plans to fit the Black Prince with the turret from the Centurion were never carried out. By the time the Black Prince prototypes had appeared in May 1945, the Sherman Firefly had proved itself in combat, the Comet tank was in service and the introduction of Centurion was imminent. All these tanks carried the QF 17-pounder or a derivative; all had better mobility than the Black Prince and the Centurion had frontal armour of comparable effectiveness.The Centurion had thinner, , frontal armour but it was sloped increasing its effective protection. The Black Prince had become redundant and the project was abandoned. The Black Prince marked the end of the development of the A22F Churchill Mk VII, and the end of the Infantry tank concept in British tank design.

They are presented as letters from Paul the Apostle to Timothy and to Titus. They are generally discussed as a group (sometimes with the addition of the Epistle to Philemon) and are given the title pastoral because they are addressed to individuals with pastoral oversight of churches and discuss issues of Christian living, doctrine and leadership. The term \\"pastorals\\" was popularized in 1703 by D. N. Berdot and in 1726 by Paul Anton.Donald Guthrie, (2009), \\"The Pastoral Epistles,\\" Inter- Varsity Press, , p. 19; Guthrie is referring to David Nicolaus Berdot, Exercitatio theologica-exegetica in epistulam S. Pauli ad Titum (Halle, 1703), and Paul Anton, Exegetische Abhandlung der Pastoral-briefe Pauli an Timotheum und Titum, im Jahr 1725. und 1726. √∂ffentlich vorgetragen (ed. Johann August Majer; 2 vols.; Halle: W√§ysenhaus, 1753‚Äì55). Alternate nomenclature for the cluster of three letters has been proposed: \\"Corpus Pastorale,\\" meant to highlight the intentional forgery of the letters as a three-part corpus,This nomenclature appears to have been first proposed by Peter Trummer, ‚ÄúCorpus Paulinum‚ÄîCorpus Pastorale: Zur Ortung der Paulustradition in den Pastoralbriefen,‚Äù in Paulus in den neutestamentlichen Sp√§tschriften: Zur Paulusrezeption im Neuen Testament (ed. K. Kertelge; Quaestiones Disputatae 89; Freiburg: Herder, 1981), 122‚Äì45. and \\"Letters to Timothy and Titus,\\" meant to emphasize the individuality of the letters.Influential in this regard is Philip H. Towner, The Letters to Timothy and Titus (New International Commentary on the New Testament; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2006), esp. 88. 1 Timothy 1 Timothy consists mainly of counsels to Timothy regarding the forms of worship and organization of the church, and the responsibilities resting on its several members, including ep√≠skopoi (, traditionally translated as bishops) and di√°konoi (); and secondly of exhortation to faithfulness in maintaining the truth amid surrounding errors (4:1ff), presented as a prophecy of erring teachers to come. The epistle's \\"irregular character, abrupt connexions and loose transitions\\" (Moffatt 1911),\\"Thus ii. 11-15 seems almost like a gloss (Hesse, Knoke), iv. 1-8 parts easily from its context, and the Œø·ΩñŒΩ of ii. 1 indicates a very loose relationship to the preceding paragraphs.\\" cited in have led critics to discern later interpolations, such as the epistle-concluding 6:20‚Äì21,Epistles 6:20‚Äì21 read as a reference to Marcion of Sinope, and lines that appear to be marginal glosses that have been copied into the body of the text. 2 Timothy The author (who identifies himself as Paul the Apostle) entreats Timothy to come to him before winter, and to bring Mark with him (cf. Phil. 2:22). He was anticipating that \\"the time of his departure was at hand\\" (4:6), and he exhorts his \\"son Timothy\\" to all diligence and steadfastness in the face of false teachings, with advice about combating them with reference to the teachings of the past, and to patience under persecution (1:6‚Äì15), and to a faithful discharge of all the duties of his office (4:1‚Äì5), with all the solemnity of one who was about to appear before the Judge of the living and the dead. Titus This short letter is addressed to Titus, a Christian worker in Crete, and is traditionally divided into three chapters. It includes advice on the character and conduct required of Church leaders (chapter 1), a structure and hierarchy for Christian teaching within the church (chapter 2), and the kind of godly conduct and moral action required of Christians in response to God's grace and gift of the Holy Spirit (chapter 3). It includes the line quoted by the author from a Cretan source: \\"Cretans are always liars, wicked beasts, and lazy gluttons\\" (). Authorship The letters are written in Paul's name and have traditionally been accepted as authentic.Harris, Stephen L., Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985. ‚ÄúThe Pastoral Epistles‚Äú p. 340‚Äì345 Since the 1700s, however, experts have increasingly come to see them as the work of someone writing after Paul's death. =Critical view: rejecting Pauline authorship= On the basis of their language, content, and other factors, the pastoral epistles are today widely regarded as not having been written by Paul, but after his death.See I.H. Marshall, A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Pastoral Epistles (International Critical Commentary; Edinburgh 1999), pp. 58 and 79. Notable exceptions to this majority position are Joachim Jeremias, Die Briefe an Timotheus und Titus (Das NT Deutsch; G√∂ttingen, 1934, 8th edition 1963) and Ceslas Spicq, Les Ep√Ætres Pastorales (√âtudes bibliques; Paris, 1948, 4th edition 1969). See too Dennis MacDonald, The Legend and the Apostle (Philadelphia 1983), especially chapters 3 and 4. (The Second Epistle to Timothy, however, is sometimes thought to be more likely than the other two to have been written by Paul.Matthijs den Dulk, (2012), \\"I Permit No Woman to Teach Except for Thecla: The Curious Case of the Pastoral Epistles and the Acts of Paul Reconsidered\\", Novum Testamentum 54 (20012), pp. 176‚Äì203) Beginning with Friedrich Schleiermacher in a letter published in 1807, biblical textual critics and scholars examining the texts fail to find their vocabulary and literary style similar to Paul's unquestionably authentic letters, fail to fit the life situation of Paul in the epistles into Paul's reconstructed biography, and identify principles of the emerged Christian church rather than those of the apostolic generation. As an example of qualitative style arguments, in the First Epistle to Timothy the task of preserving the tradition is entrusted to ordained presbyters; the clear sense of presb√Ωteros () as an indication of an office is a sense that to these scholars seems alien to Paul and the apostolic generation. Examples of other offices include the twelve apostles in Acts and the appointment of seven deacons, thus establishing the office of the diaconate. Presb√Ωteros is sometimes translated as elder; via Ecclesiastical Latin it is also the Greek root for the English word priest. (The office of presbyter is also mentioned in James chapter 5.) A second example would be gender roles depicted in the letters, which proscribe roles for women that appear to deviate from Paul's more egalitarian teaching that in Christ there is neither male nor female. Separate male and female roles, however, were not foreign to the authentic Pauline epistles; the First Letter to the Corinthians (14:34‚Äì35) commands silence from women during church services, stating that \\"it is a shame for women to speak in the church\\". Father Jerome Murphy-O'Connor, O.P., in the New Jerome Biblical Commentary, \\"agrees with many other commentators on this passage over the last hundred years in recognising it to be an interpolation by a later editor of 1 Corinthians of a passage from 1 Timothy 2:11‚Äì15 that states a similar 'women should be silent in churches. This made 1 Corinthians more widely acceptable to church leaders in later times. If verses before or after 1 Corinthians 14:34‚Äì35 are read, it is fairly clear that verses 34 and 35 seem out of place.New Jerome Biblical Commentary, ed. Raymond E. Brown, S.S., Joseph A. Fitzmyer, S.J, and Roland E. Murphy, O.Carm., Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1990, pp. 811‚Äì812 Similarly, biblical scholars since Schleiermacher in 1807 have noted that the pastoral epistles seem to argue against a more developed Gnosticism than would be compatible with Paul's time. The pastoral epistles are omitted in some early bible manuscripts, including the fourth century Codex Vaticanus (one of the oldest mostly complete bible manuscripts in existence) and the second or third century Chester Beatty Papyrus 46 (the oldest mostly complete copy of the Pauline epistles). Scholars refer to the anonymous author as \\"the Pastor\\". =Traditional view: Saint Paul= Among the Apostolic Fathers, \\"a strong case can be made for Ignatius' use of ... 1 and 2 Timothy\\".Paul Foster, \\"Ignatius of Antioch,\\" in Gregory and Tuckett (eds), (2005), The Reception of the NT in the Apostolic Fathers, OUP, p.185 Similarly for Polycarp.Michael W. Holmes, in Gregory and Tuckett (eds), (2005), The Reception of the NT in the Apostolic Fathers, OUP, p.226 The unidentified author of the Muratorian fragment (c. 170) lists the Pastorals as Pauline, while excluding others e.g. to the Laodiceans. Origen refers to the \\"fourteen epistles of Paul\\" without specifically naming Titus or Timothy.See the writings of Eusebius, Apostolic Constitutions, etc. However it is believed that Origen wrote a commentary on at least the epistle to Titus.R.E. Heine, (2000), \\"In Search of Origen's Commentary on Philemon\\", Harvard Theological Review 93 (2000), pp. 117‚Äì133 Biblical scholars such as Michael Licona or Ray Van Neste who ascribe the books to Paul find their placement fits within his life and work and see the linguistic differences as complementary to differences in the recipients. While other Pauline epistles have fledgling congregations as the audience, the recipients of record in the Pastoral Epistles are Paul's close companions, evangelists whom he has extensively worked with and trained. In this view, linguistic differences are to be expected, if one is to assert Pauline authorship to them. JohnsonJohnson, Luke Timothy (2001), \\"The First and Second Letters to Timothy: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary\\", Anchor Bible, , p.91 asserts the impossibility of demonstrating the authenticity of the Pastoral Letters. Date It is highly probable that 1 and 2 Timothy were known and used by Polycarp in his epistle to the Philippians.I.H. Marshall and P.H. Towner, (1999), The Pastoral Epistles (International Critical Commentary; Edinburgh: T&T; Clark), p. 3, Polycarp is known to have died around 155-167, so this would seem to set an upper limit for the dating of the pastoral epistles. Irenaeus explicitly references the epistles to Timothy in his anti-Gnostic treatise Against Heresies, written c. 180 AD.Irenaeus, Against Heresies 3.3.3 Proposals by scholars for the date of their composition have ranged from the 1st century to well into the second. The later dates are usually based on the hypothesis that the Pastorals are responding to specific 2nd-century developments, such as Marcionism and Gnosticism. Several scholars have argued that the pastoral epistles attack Marcionism in particular. If Marcion is taken to have started his ministry in earnest only after his excommunication from the Roman church in 144 CE, then this would suggest that the pastoral epistles were written after 144. Furthermore, the fact that Marcion's canon did not include the pastoral epistles is another piece of evidence for which any model must account.See, e.g., J. J. Clabeaux, A Lost Edition of the Letters of Paul: A Reassessment of the Text of the Pauline Corpus Attested by Marcion (Catholic Biblical Quarterly Monograph Series 21; Washington, D.C.: Catholic Biblical Association, 1989 On the other hand, according to Raymond E. Brown (An Introduction to the New Testament, 1997), the majority of scholars who accept a post-Pauline date of composition for the Pastorals favour the period 80‚Äì100. Scholars supporting a date in this mid range can draw on the description in 2 Timothy 1:5 of Timothy's Christian mother and grandmother who passed on their faith, as alluding to the original audience being third generation Christians.

Since its adoption by the United States Federal Council of Churches in 1942, it has been used by many Christian traditions, including the Anglican, Baptist, Lutheran, Mennonite, Methodist, Moravian, Presbyterian, Quaker, and Reformed, among others. Africa and the Americas are regions of the world where the flag remains popular. The flag has a white field, with a red Latin cross inside a blue canton. The shade of red on the cross symbolizes the blood that Jesus shed on Calvary. The blue represents the waters of baptism as well as the faithfulness of Jesus. The white represents Jesus' purity. The dimensions of the flag and canton have no official specifications. Origins The Christian Flag was first conceived on September 26, 1897, at Brighton Chapel on Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York in the United States. The superintendent of a Sunday school, Charles C. Overton, gave an impromptu lecture to the gathered students, because the scheduled speaker had failed to arrive for the event. He gave a speech asking the students what a flag representing Christianity would look like. Overton thought about his improvised speech for many years afterward. In 1907, he and Ralph Diffendorfer, secretary of the Methodist Young People's Missionary Movement, designed and began promoting the flag. With regard to the Christian symbolism of the Christian Flag: The ecumenical organization, Federal Council of Churches (now succeeded by the National Council of Churches and Christian Churches Together) adopted the flag on 23 January 1942, 45 years after unofficial use since 1897; the Federal Council of Churches represented Baptist, Brethren, Eastern Orthodox, Episcopal, Methodist, Moravian, Lutheran, Oriental Orthodox, Polish National Catholic, Presbyterian, Quaker, and Reformed traditions, among others. The Christian Flag intentionally has no patent, as the designer dedicated the flag to all of Christendom. Fanny Crosby wrote the words to a hymn called \\"The Christian Flag\\" with music by R. Huntington Woodman. Like the flag, the hymn is free use. On the Sunday nearest 26 September 1997, the Christian Flag celebrated its one hundredth anniversary. Usage Mexican children displaying the Christian Flag alongside the Mexican one. Mainline Protestant denominations in the United States accepted the flag first, and by the 1980s many institutions had described policies for displaying it inside churches. The Federal Council of Churches recommended that if the Christian Flag is to be used alongside a national flag, that the Christian Flag should receive the place of honor. During World War II the flag was flown along with the U.S. flag in a number of Lutheran churches, many of them with German backgrounds, who wanted to show their solidarity with the United States during the war against Germany. The Christian Flag spread outside North America with Christian missionaries. It can be seen today in or outside many Christian churches throughout the world, particularly in Latin America and in Africa. It has so far been adopted by some Protestant churches in Europe, Asia, and Africa as well. The Christian Flag is not patented and therefore, \\"Anyone may manufacture it, and it may be used on all proper occasions.\\" In U.S. evangelical Christian schools, it is customary for the Christian flag to be displayed opposite the U.S. flag. In Canada and the United States, accommodationists and separationists have entered impassioned debate on the legality of erecting the Christian Flag atop governmental buildings. Pledge Some churches and organizations practice a \\"pledge of allegiance\\" or \\"affirmation of loyalty\\" to the Christian Flag, which is similar to the Pledge of Allegiance to the U.S. flag. The first pledge was written by Lynn Harold Hough, a Methodist minister who had heard Ralph Diffendorfer, secretary to the Methodist Young People's Missionary Movement, promoting the Christian flag at a rally.. He wrote the following pledge: Some more conservative evangelical, Lutheran, Adventist, and Baptist churches and schools may use an alternative version of the pledge: Others use this version: See also * American civil religion * Black Standard * Christian symbolism * Civil religion * Cross necklace * Flag of Israel * Flag of the Vatican City * Head of Christ * History of Christian flags * Islamic flags * Nordic cross flag References Further reading  External links  Category:Christian symbols Category:Christian ecumenism Category:Religious flags Category:Flags with crosses Category:Flags introduced in 1907 ","title":"Christian Flag"},{"id":"1268210","text":"The Mesquite Independent School District is a school district in Mesquite, Texas (USA) (incorporating most of Mesquite and portions of Balch Springs, Dallas, Garland, and Seagoville, as well as formerly serving all high school students of Sunnyvale) which follows the standard definition of an independent school district. The district is rather large, containing in excess of 35,000 students. There are five main high schools, Three of which are AAAAAA (or 6A, the highest in a system of Texas school size classification). As of July 1, 2015, the superintendent is Dr. David Vroonland. All houses and residential areas in Mesquite ISD are each assigned to an elementary school (Pre-K-5 or K-5), a middle school (6-8 or 7-8), and a high school (9-12). In addition, the MISD operates two high school football facilities for its high schools, Memorial Stadium near West Mesquite High School (which is the largest high- school football stadiums in Texas, seating nearly 20,000 ) and E. H. Hanby Stadium, which is located adjacent to Mesquite High School. In 2009, the school district was rated \\"Recognized\\" by the Texas Education Agency. Demographics In 1997, 70.6% of the students were non-Hispanic white; of the four large suburban majority-white suburban school districts in the county, MISD had the highest percentage of white students. From that year to 2016 the number had declined by 68%, making it the most severe decline of the four districts. From 1997 to 2016 the number of students on free or reduced lunches, a way of classifying a student as low income, increased by 266%. Standardized dress and dress codes The district has implemented standardized dress (similar to a school uniform) for middle and high school students, which started with the 2005 to 2006 school year. The districtwide dress code also dictates hair length and acceptable hair styles of male students. It was one of the first Dallas-area school districts to implement a formal dress code, and Karel Holloway of The Dallas Morning News wrote in 2009 that \\"The district is well-known for its conservative standards for dress\\". In the 1970s the district sent a boy home from school because his hair touched his collar. This caused national attention.

Life Arthur Peter Monroe Phillips was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He is Jewish. He received a BA in history from Harvard University in 1990. After spending two years in Budapest (1990‚Äì1992), he then studied jazz saxophone for four semesters at Berklee College of Music (1992‚Äì93). In several interviews, Phillips has stated he has been a child actor,IMDb profile; accessed April 4, 2014. a jazz musician, a five-time Jeopardy! champion, a speechwriter, an advertising copywriter for medical devices, and a \\"dismally failed entrepreneur.\\" Phillips lived in Budapest from 1990 to 1992 and in Paris from 2001 to 2003, and now lives in New York. He was featured on the July 27, 2007, episode of This American Life, reading his short story \\"Wenceslas Square.\\" The story is being produced for film by Amazon Studios, with a script by Phillips, to be directed by Sophia Takal. Before becoming a best-selling novelist, Phillips was a five-time champion on Jeopardy! in 1997. In 2005, he competed in the Jeopardy! Ultimate Tournament of Champions. He won his opening-round game but lost in the second round. Phillips is married to film producer Barbara Muschietti. Works =Prague (2002)= Prague, despite its title, is set almost entirely in Budapest, Hungary, primarily in 1990, with an interlude detailing several previous generations of Hungarian history, from the Austro-Hungarian monarchy through the First and Second World Wars. The main line of the novel follows a group of young Western expatriates through their lives in Budapest. The structure of the novel allows for various tales to be interwoven, producing an ensemble portrait of them and their adopted city, just recovering from decades of Communism, fascism, and war. The novel's recurring themes include nostalgia, sincerity and authenticity, and young people's first search for meaning in life. The novel was well received commercially and critically, winning Phillips the 2003 Los Angeles Times/Art Seidenbaum Award for Best First Fiction, as well as other honors. =The Egyptologist (2004)= The Egyptologist is structured as journals, letters, telegrams, and drawings, from several different points of view. The main story is set in 1922 and follows a hopeful explorer who, working near Howard Carter (the man who discovered the tomb of King Tutankhamun), risks more and more of his life and savings on an apparently quixotic effort to find the tomb of an apocryphal Egyptian king. The book was an international bestseller and critical success in more than two dozen countries. US critics noted Phillips's versatility in producing a book so different from his first, and fans of the book included Gary Shteyngart, George Saunders, Elizabeth Peters, and Stephen King. Others, however, most notably Michiko Kakutani of The New York Times, found the book overlong and confusing. =Angelica (2007)= Angelica is superficially a Victorian ghost story, and won Phillips comparisons to Henry James, Vladimir Nabokov, and Stephen King. The Washington Post' opined that the novel cemented Phillips' reputation as \\"one of the best writers in America\\". In the novel, the same events are retold four times from four different perspectives, each section casting doubt on the version that came before, until the reader is left to sort truth from fantasy on his or her own. The novel has been made into a film by Mitchell Lichtenstein with a release date in late 2017. =The Song Is You (2009)= Phillips' fourth novel tells the story of a middle-aged man's pursuit of a young woman, an Irish pop singer performing in a bar. According to a review at Bookpage > \\"Set in New York, the story follows Julian Donahue as he navigates the > shadowy, grief-filled world of a parent who has lost a child [...] He's > consumed by [the singer], but rather than introducing himself as another > disposable fan, he becomes a faraway mentor and muse, setting himself on a > course that will lead him from New York to Europe.\\" The novel was published on April 7, 2009.

Among members, the church is typically referred to as \\"The Truth\\" or \\"The Way\\". Those outside the church refer to it as \\"Two by Twos\\", \\"The Black Stockings\\", \\"No-name Church\\", \\"Cooneyites\\", \\"Workers and Friends\\" or \\"Christians Anonymous.\\" Church ministers are itinerant and work in groups of two, hence the name \\"Two by Twos\\". The church's registered names include \\"Christian Conventions\\" in the United States, \\"Assemblies of Christians\\" in Canada, \\"The Testimony of Jesus\\" in the United Kingdom, \\"Kristna i Sverige\\" in Sweden, and \\"United Christian Conventions\\" in Australia. These organization names are used only for registration purposes and are not used by members. The church was founded in 1897 in Ireland by William Irvine, an evangelist with the interdenominational Faith Mission. Irvine began independently preaching a return to the method of itinerant ministry he claimed was set forth in Matthew 10. Church growth was rapid, spreading outside Ireland. Irvine eventually began preaching a new order in which the hierarchy that had developed within the church would have no placement. This teaching became controversial within the church and led to his expulsion by church overseers around 1914. One of the church's most prominent evangelists, Edward Cooney, was expelled a decade after Irvine. The church then became much less visible to outsiders for the next half-century. Publication of several articles and books, increased news coverage, and the appearance of the Internet have since opened the church to wider scrutiny. The church does not explicitly publish any doctrinal statements, claiming these must be orally imparted by its ministers, referred to as \\"workers\\". Doctrine of the church teaches that salvation is available only by accepting the preaching of its homeless, unsalaried ministry workers and by attending the group's home meetings. The orthodox Christian Trinitarian doctrine is rejected, and members are told to deny any church name. Baptism by immersion as performed by one of the church's workers is required for full participation. Some in the church claim it is a direct continuation of the 1st-century Christian church. Others in the church believe that a restoration of some sort may have occurred in the late 19th century. Members hold regular weekly worship gatherings in local homes on Sunday and in midweek. The church holds annual regional conventions and public Gospel meetings. The church claims no official headquarters or official publications. Its hymnbook and various other materials for internal use are produced by outside publishers and printing firms. Printed invitations and advertisements for its open gospel meetings are the only written materials which those outside the church are likely to encounter.  History  = Founding = In 1896, William Irvine was sent from Scotland to southern Ireland as a missionary by John George Govan's Faith Mission, an interdenominational organization with roots in the Holiness movement. Because his mission was successful, he was promoted to superintendent of Faith Mission in southern Ireland. A drawing from 1907 depicting a baptismal rite. Its caption read \\"How 'Dippers' are Initiated\\". Within a few months of his arrival in Ireland, Irvine was already disillusioned with the Faith Mission. There was friction over its Holiness teachings, and Irvine saw its organization as a violation of his concept of a faith-based ministry. Above all, Irvine was increasingly intolerant of the Faith Mission's cooperation with the other churches and clergy in the various communities of southern Ireland, regarding converts who joined churches as \\"lost among the clergy\\". In 1897, he began preaching independently, proclaiming that true ministers must have no home and take no salary. He became convinced that he had received this as a special revelation he referred to as his \\"Alpha message\\".See: * ; * ; * . Opposed to all other established churches, he held that the manner in which the disciples had been sent out in chapter 10 of the Gospel of Matthew was a permanent commandment which must still be observed.See: * ; * ; * . The passage reads in part: In October 1897, Irvine was invited by Nenagh businessman John \\"Jack\\" Carroll to preach in the Carrolls' hometown of Rathmolyon. There he held a series of mission meetings in which all established churches were rejected, and Irvine's new doctrine and method of ministry were set forth. It was in Rathmolyon that he recruited the first adherents to his new message. Aside from condemning all other churches, Irvine's doctrine included the rejection of church buildings, damnation of all followers of churches outside the new fellowship, rejection of paid ministry, rejection of collections during services and collection boxes, and the requirement that those seeking to join the ministry \\"sell all\\".See: * ; * ; * . Irvine's preaching during this latest mission influenced others who began to leave their respective churches and join Irvine to form an initial core of followers. Some of these early adherents would become important members of the new church, including John Long, the Carroll family, John Kelly, Edward Cooney‚Äîan influential evangelist from the Church of Ireland‚Äîand George Walker (an employee of the Cooney family's fabric business), all of whom eventually \\"sold all\\" and joined the new movement as itinerant preachers.1905 \\"List of Workers\\" in Although other movements, such as the Plymouth Brethren and Elim have had strong Irish connections, the church founded by Irvine is the only religion known to have had its origin and early development in Ireland. = Early growth = The Impartial Reporter and Farmers' Journal from 1910 documenting the early phases of the church. See endnote for link to the full article. Unlike later secretiveness, initially, the church was in the public eye, with questions about it being raised in the British Parliament beginning in 1900.See: * ; * ; * . Inspired by speakers such as Irvine and Cooney, membership growth was rapid. Rather than adding members to established denominations, as was the practice of the Faith Mission outreach, churches began noticing their congregations thinning after exposure to the Two by Two missions. Clerics soon began regarding the Two by Two preachers as \\"inimical to the membership of the church\\". After receiving reports from Ireland, the Faith Mission in 1900 formally disassociated itself from Irvine and any of its workers found to be participating in the new Two by Two movement. The attention of Belfast newspapers was initially drawn to the Two by Twos church because of its open-air baptismal rites. At that time, the baptisms took place in public settings such as streams, lakes or the sea, even in cold weather. Regarded as a novelty, the outdoor \\"dippings\\" and accompanying sermons attracted large crowds. Further attention was given during the staging of large marches through boroughs and public preaching in town squares and on street corners. Workers, including Edward Cooney and George Walker, publicly preached that all members of other churches were damned. They singled out prominent individuals, and even entire communities, for condemnation. At times, missions were sited close to the meeting places of other denominations, which were denounced using \\"extreme language\\". Consequences of these inflammatory remarks ranged from heckling and street violence to the break-up of families,See: * ; * ; * ; * . all of which brought further attention to the church. Newspapers in Ireland, Britain and North America followed the disturbances that arose over the church's activities and message.Accounts of some of the many incidents include: * ; * ; * ; * ; * ; * ; * ; * ; * . Some hosted debates in their editorial columns. One member of Parliament offered to join the Two by Twos if they would cease criticizing other religious bodies. As the ranks of its ministry increased, the church's outreach expanded. Large gatherings were held in Dublin, Glasgow and Belfast during 1899. Annual conventions, modeled after the evangelical Keswick Conventions in England, began to be held regularly in Ireland starting in 1903. Later that year, William Irvine, accompanied by Irvine Weir and George Walker, took his message to North America. Missions to continental Europe, Australia and Asia followed. By 1904, the requirement to \\"sell all\\" was no longer mentioned in sermons. A two-tiered system was instituted that made a distinction between homeless itinerant missionaries (called \\"workers\\") and those who were now allowed to retain homes and jobs (called \\"friends\\" or \\"saints\\"). Weekly home meetings began to be held and presided over by \\"elders\\", who were typically the householder. During the next few years, this change became universal. The church continued to grow rapidly and held regular annual conventions lasting several weeks at a time. Irvine traveled widely during this period, attending conventions and preaching worldwide, and began sending workers from the British Isles to follow up and expand interest in various areas.See: * ; * ; * . Beginning in 1906, unwelcome attention came in the form of leaflets and billboard notices. W. D. Wilson, an English farmer whose unmarried children had left home and joined the Two by Twos, began publishing articles stating girls were being recruited by the church for immoral purposes. In response, Edward Cooney brought a widely publicized suit for libel that was resolved by a settlement between the parties by the end of 1913. A hierarchy was instituted by Irvine and his most trusted associates in various regions were designated as \\"overseers\\" or \\"head workers\\". Each worker was assigned a particular geographical sphere and then coordinated the efforts of the ministry within his area. Among the overseers were William and Jack Carroll, George Walker and Willie Gill. Irvine continued to have the ultimate say over worker conduct and finances, and his activities within their fields became regarded as \\"interference\\". Except for such annual conventions as he was able to attend across the globe, communications and instructions from Irvine passed through the overseers. = Schism = William Irvine's progressive revelation continued to evolve over this time, and eschatological themes began to appear in sermons. By 1914, he had begun to preach that the Age of Grace, during which his \\"Alpha Gospel\\" had been proclaimed, was coming to a close. As his message turned towards indicating a new era, which held no place for the ministry and hierarchy that had rapidly grown up around the \\"Alpha Gospel\\", resentment arose on the part of overseers who saw him as a threat to their positions. Australian overseer John Hardie was the first to break with Irvine and excluded him from speaking at the South Australia convention in late 1913. As 1914 progressed, he was excluded from speaking in a growing number of regions, as more overseers broke away from him. Rumors circulated about Irvine's comfortable lifestyle and supposed weakness for women, though nothing concrete was ever exposed. It was put about that Irvine \\"had lost the Lord's anointing\\" in an effort to explain his ouster. He was shunned and his name was no longer mentioned, making him a nonperson in the church he founded. There were many excommunications of Irvine loyalists in various fields during the following years, and by 1919, the split was final, with Irvine moving to Jerusalem and transmitting his \\"Omega Message\\" to his core followers from there. Lacking any organizational means of making his case before the membership, Irvine's ouster occurred quietly. Most members continued following the overseers, and few outside the leadership knew the details behind Irvine's disappearance from the scene, as no public mention of the split seems to have been made. Mention of Irvine's name was forbidden, and a new explanation of the group's history was introduced from which Irvine's role was erased. Although the threat posed by Irvine to the church's organization had been dealt with, the prominent worker Edward Cooney refused to place his evangelistic efforts under the control of the overseers. Cooney himself adhered to the earlier, unfettered style of itinerant ministry, moving about wherever he felt he was needed. He rejected the appointment of head workers to geographic regions and criticized their lifestyles. He also preached against the \\"Living Witness\\" doctrine (i.e., that salvation entails hearing the gospel preached directly by a worker and seeing the gospel made alive in the sacrificial lives of the ministry), the bank accounts controlled by the overseers, use of halls for meetings, conventions, the hierarchy that had developed and the ministry and the registrations under official names. For a time, his message urging a return to the original principles of Matthew 10 gained a following, even among some Australian overseers. A second division occurred in 1928 when Edward Cooney was expelled for criticizing the hierarchy and other elements that had arisen within the church, which he saw as serious deviations from the church's original message. The overseers seized upon a failed attempt at performing a faith healing as a pretext to excommunicate him. Cooney's loyal supporters joined him, including some of the early workers, and they stayed faithful to what they perceived to be the original tenets. The term \\"Cooneyite\\" today chiefly refers to the group which separated (or were excommunicated) along with Cooney and who continue as an independent group. Prior to the schism, onlookers had labeled the entire movement as \\"Cooneyites\\" due to Edward Cooney's prominence in the early growth of the church. There are areas where this older usage continues. = Consolidation = These schisms were not widely publicized, and few were aware that they had occurred. Most supporters of Irvine, and later Cooney, were either coaxed into abandoning those loyalties or put out of the fellowship. Among these were the early workers May Carroll, Irvine Weir (one of the first workers in North America, who was excommunicated for continued contact with Cooney and for his objection to registration of the church under names) and Tom Elliot (who had conducted baptisms of the first workers and was nicknamed \\"Tom the Baptist\\"). The emergence of the Two by Twos caused severe splits within local Protestant churches in Ireland at a time of increased pressure for independence by the Catholic majority. Because of animosity, they did not form a united front with other Protestant communities. Although the church was noted for extreme anti- Catholic views, it played a very minor role during the struggle for Irish independence. One exception was the involvement of the Pearson family in the still-controversial Coolacrease incident. In the mid-1920s, a magazine article entitled \\"The Cooneyites or Go-Preachers\\" disturbed the leadership, who made efforts to have it withdrawn, particularly when material from the article was added to the widely distributed reference Heresies Exposed. During this period, the church modified its evangelical outreach. The public preaching of its early days was replaced with low-key \\"gospel meetings\\", which were attended only by members and invitees. The church began to assert that it had a 1st-century origin. It asserted that it had no organization or name and disclaimed any unique doctrines. The church shunned publicity, making the church very difficult for outsiders to follow. Last page of senior overseer George Walker's statement to the U.S. Selective Service in 1942 under the name \\"Christian Conventions\\" The North American church saw a struggle for influence between overseers George Walker in the east and Jack Carroll. In 1928, an agreement was forged between the senior overseers which limited workers operating outside of their appointed geographical spheres, known as \\"fields\\": workers traveling into an area controlled by another overseer had to first submit their revelation to, and obtain permission from, the local overseer. The exact boundaries between fields was worked out over time, and there were areas where workers under the control of more than one overseer operated, causing conflict. During the First World War, the church obtained exemption from military service in Britain under the name \\"The Testimony of Jesus\\". However, there were problems with recognition of this name outside the British Isles, and exemption was refused in many other areas. In New Zealand during World War I, members of the church could not prove their conscientious objector status, and formed the largest segment of those imprisoned for refusal to serve. Members and ministers also had difficulty establishing their conscientious objector status in the United States during the First World War. With the start of the Second World War, formal names were adopted and used in registering the church with various national governments. These names continued to be used for official business, and stationery bearing those names was printed for the use of overseers. Most members were not aware of these names. Some who dissented after learning of the practice were expelled by the workers. After the death of Australian overseer William Carroll in 1953, an attempt was made to reintegrate the repudiated adherents of William Irvine and Edward Cooney. Rather than producing further unity, the attempt produced conflicts over the church's history which was exposed, the existence of legal names, disagreements over the hierarchy which had developed and other controversies. Many excommunications took place in the subsequent effort to enforce harmony. The earliest workers and overseers were succeeded by a new generation of leaders. In Europe, William Irvine died in 1947, Edward Cooney died in 1960, and John Long (expelled in 1907) died in 1962. British overseer Willie Gill died in 1951. In the South Pacific, New Zealand overseer Wilson McClung died in 1944, and Australian overseer John Hardie died in 1961. In North America, both Jack Carroll, the Western overseer, and Irvine Weir died in 1957 while Eastern overseer George Walker died in 1981. Its policy of not revealing its name, finances, doctrine or history, and avoidance of publicity largely kept the church from public notice. A few authors of popular literature have noted the church, even using it as background for various works.Uses as background for literary works include, * ; * ; * ; * . Notes regarding the Two by Twos appeared even more infrequently in religious journals and sociological works, with some writers assuming that the church had greatly declined, with nothing published regarding it. The publication of The Secret Sect in the early 1980s, followed by press reports and public statements by former members, however, increased public awareness of the church. Availability of information on the Internet since the 1990s has also resulted in a loosening of the strict standards demanded of members.  Doctrine  Apart from their hymnals, officially published documentation or statements from the church are scarce, which makes it difficult to speak in depth about its beliefs. Some former members and critics of the church have made statements about its beliefs, although these points have rarely been publicly responded to by any authorities within the church. All the church's teachings are expressed orally, and the church does not publish doctrine or statements of faith. Workers hold that all church teachings are based solely on the Bible. A catchphrase frequently used to describe the church is: \\"The church in the home, and the ministry without a home\\".Overseer John \\"Jack\\" Carroll quoted in . The church does not own church buildings. These are seen as inconsistent with biblical Christianity and were strongly denounced by early workers.See: * ; * ; * . Its ministers do not own homes or draw a salary. The church has upheld these practices since its inception. Notwithstanding this tradition, buildings specially constructed or repurposed for the use of the church do exist, including convention buildings, meeting halls,See: * ; * ; * . tents and caravans and portable halls. Real properties are largely held and maintained on behalf of the church by certain members, however in recent years, a Northern Irish investment vehicle has been used to purchase English convention property. The Bible is the only book used in services. The Bible itself is held as insufficient for salvation unless its words be made \\"alive\\" through preaching of its ministers.See: * ; * ; * ; * ; * ; * ; * ; * ; * . The extemporaneous preaching of the ministry is considered to be guided by God and must be heard directly. Great weight is given to the thoughts of workers, especially more senior workers. Salvation is achieved through willingness to uphold the church's standards, by faithfully following in \\"the way\\", and by personal worthiness.See: * ; * ; * . Doctrines such as predestination, original sin, justification by faith alone, and redemption as the sole basis of salvation are rejected.See: * ; * ; * ; * . The church is exclusiveSee: * ; * ; * ; * . ‚Äî all other churches, religions and ministries are held to be false and salvation is only obtainable through the Two by Two ministry and meetings.See: * ; * ; * ; * ; * ; * ; * ; * ; * . Salvation is deemed to require self-sacrifice in following the example and commandments of Jesus and suffering is revered. Members are encouraged to attend meetings and to speak at them.Worker Leo Stancliff quoted in . Although the church has roots in the Holiness movement and has inherited some of its features, charismatic elements are suppressed. Other standards include modest dress, not wearing jewelry, long hair for women and short hair for men, not getting piercings, not dying hair, not getting a tattoo, and avoiding activities deemed to be worldly or frivolous (such as smoking, drinking alcohol, watching television, and viewing motion pictures).See: * ; * ; * ; * ; * . Standards and practices vary geographically: for example, in some areas fermented wine is used in Sunday meetings, in other areas grape juice is used; in some areas people who have divorced and remarried are not allowed to participate in meetings, in others they may.See: * ; * ; * . The use of television, social media sites and other mass media is discouraged in some areas, based on the stance of the local workers and overseers.See: * ; * ; * ; * . Some external standards in dress and conduct have been loosened in recent years in response to criticisms. = Christology = The church has rejected the doctrine of the Trinity since its inception.See: * ; * ; * . Though members believe in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, they hold a unitarian view of Christ.See: * ; * Melton quoted in ; * . The Holy Spirit is held as an attitude or force from God. Jesus is God's son, a fully human figure who came to earth to establish a way of ministry and salvation, but not God himself.Worker Eldon Kendrew quoted in . Great stress is laid upon the \\"example life\\" of Jesus, as a pattern for the ministry. = Baptism = Baptism by one of the church's ministers is considered a necessary step for full participation, including re-baptism of persons baptized by other churches.See: * ; * ; * ; * . Candidates approved by the local workers are baptized by immersion. = Church name = Application for incorporation in the Province of Alberta under the name \\"Alberta Society of Christian Assemblies\\" The church represents itself as nondenominational and without a name. Those outside the church often use descriptive terms such as \\"Two by Twos\\" (from their method of sending out ministers in pairs), \\"No-name Church\\", \\"Cooneyites\\", \\"Workers and Friends\\", \\"Christian fellowship\\", \\"disciples of Jesus\\", \\"Friends\\", \\"Go-preachers\\", \\"People on the Way\\", \\"Tramp Preachers\\", among other titles.See: * ; * ; * ; * ; * ; * . The new movement was originally called \\"Tramp Preachers\\" or \\"Tramp Pilgrims\\" by observers. During the early years, they called themselves by the name \\"Go-Preachers\\". By 1904, the terms \\"Cooneyism\\" and \\"Cooneyite\\" had been coined in those areas in which Edward Cooney established churches and where he was a vocal promoter.See: * ; * ; * . The term \\"Two by Twos\\" was in use in Canada by the early 1920s and in the United States by the 1930s. In Germany, bynames for the church have included \\"Die Namenlosen\\" (the Nameless), \\"Wahre Christen\\" (True Christians), \\"J√ºnger Jesu\\" (Disciples of Jesus) and \\"Freunde\\" (Friends). In France, they have been known as \\"Les Anonymes\\" (the Anonymous, or No-names). Though overseers and head workers use registered names when necessary to conduct official business, most members do not associate a formal name with the church. Instead, they refer to the church as \\"The Truth\\", \\"The Way\\", \\"The Jesus Way\\" or \\"The Lowly Way\\".See: * ; * ; * . Few members are aware that the church has official names used for church business, including seeking military exemptions.See: * ; * ; * . Registered names vary from nation to nation. In the United States, the name used is \\"Christian Conventions\\", in Canada \\"Assemblies of Christians\\" is used, in Britain it is \\"the Testimony of Jesus\\", in Sweden the registered name is \\"Kristna I Sverige\\", and \\"United Christian Conventions\\" has been used in Australia and other nations (Australian members previously adopted the name \\"Testimony of Jesus\\" during World War I, and registered as \\"Christian Assemblies\\" during World War II).See: * ; * ; * ; * . In 1995, controversy arose in Alberta, Canada, when part of the church incorporated as the \\"Alberta Society of Christian Assemblies\\". The entity was dissolved in 1996 after its existence became generally known. = Restorationism = Many church members hold to a long-standing view that the church has no earthly founder, and that only they represent the \\"true Christian Church\\", originating directly with Christ during the 1st century AD.See: * ; * ; * ; * . Some members have more recently made statements which diverge from that view and hint either at a beginning during the closing years of the 19th century or at a notable resurgence or restoration around that time. = Terminology = The following are terms used by the church with the definitions giving the sense commonly intended and understood by members. ; '''' : generally, a small, local congregation that meets in a home; can refer to a larger group of believers or to the church as a whole. This term is never used to refer to a building, except when referring to church buildings of other denominations, or occasionally when speaking metaphorically. Used colloquially when talking to strangers to refer to Sunday/Wednesday activity, e.g., \\"I'll be at church until midday.\\" ; '''' : formal religious gatherings. ; '''' : a geographical region to which workers have been assigned (similar to parishes). ; '''' : a series of larger meetings known as gospel meetings the function of which is proselytizing. Generally a sequence of such gospel meetings will conclude with a day during which‚Äîas a hymn is sung‚Äîthose interested may rise to their feet and thereby profess their willingness to follow the teachings of the church (or \\"the way\\"). ; '''' : adherent or member, the laity. Collectively \\"the friends,\\" or \\"the saints.\\" ; '''' : to make a public declaration of one's willingness to become a member, which is generally a sign that a person may then participate in the prayer and testimony sections of Wednesday night and Sunday morning meetings or at designated testimony times in larger gatherings. Professing constitutes an intermediate stage. Following baptism, the partaking of bread and grape juice (or wine) is also permitted, which in some fields occurs between the elder's testimony and the final hymn. ; '''' : a chairman of a local meeting. Normally the male head of the house in which meetings are held. The bishop/elder is usually the person in charge of calling the start of the meeting. When a worker is present, he or she will generally initiate and direct the gathering instead. The deacon is considered to be an alternate to the elder in some areas. ; '''' : terms used to denote the church's semi-itinerant, homeless ministers. These are unmarried (several exceptions were made during the first half of the 20th century to allow married couples to enter the ministry), and do not have any formal training. Workers go out in same-sex pairs (hence the term \\"Two by Two\\"), consisting of a more experienced worker with a junior companion. ; '''' : the senior worker in charge of a geographic area, roughly corresponding to the position of a bishop in Catholicism. There is no hierarchical position higher than overseer‚Äîsuch as a pope‚Äîwhich might guarantee doctrinal and practical unanimity.  Practice and structure  = Ministry = The church holds that faith and salvation may only be obtained by hearing the preaching of its ministers (typically called workers), and by observing their sacrificial lives. During the early years, this requirement was referred to as the \\"Living Witness Doctrine,\\" though that term is no longer used. The minister must be heard and observed in person, rather than by broadcasts, recordings, books or tracts, or other indirect communication. The church's ministerial structure is based on Jesus' instructions to his apostles found in Matthew Chapter 10, verses 8‚Äì16 (with similar passages in Mark and in Luke). The church's view is that, following these Biblical examples, its ministers have no permanent dwelling places, minister in pairs, sell all and go out with only minimal worldly possessions, and rely only upon hospitality and generosity. Most ministers receive their support and income directly from lay members, and have no fixed address except for mail collection. The option of entering the ministry is theoretically open to every baptized member, although it has been many decades since married people were accepted into the ministry. Female workers operate in the same manner as male workers. However, they cannot rise to the position of overseer, do not lead meetings when a male worker is present, and occupy a lower rank than male workers. Workers do not engage in any formal religious training.See: * ; * ; * ; * ; * ; * . Overseers pair new workers with senior companions until they are deemed ready to move beyond a junior position. The workers are assigned new companions annually. Workers organize and assign members to the home meetings, appoint elders, and decide controversies among members. Workers are not registered marriage celebrants, so members are married by secular functionaries (such as a justice of the peace). However, workers will give sermons and prayers at members' weddings if requested, and they officiate at the funerals of members.See: * ; * ; * . In April 2019 the Australian current affairs television show 60 Minutes interviewed child sex abuse victims of Australian ministers. = Gatherings = The church holds several types of gatherings throughout the year in various locations. ; '''' : A Gospel meeting is the gathering that is most likely to be open to those considered to be \\"outsiders\\". At one time, Gospel meetings were typically held in tents, set up by workers as they traveled; they are now most commonly held in a rented space. Gospel meetings are held to attract new members, though professing members typically make up the majority of attendees. The Gospel meeting consists of a period of quiet, followed by congregational singing (often accompanied by piano) of selected hymns, and then sermons delivered by the church's workers. Gospel meetings are regularly scheduled for portions of the year in areas where the group is well- established. They may also be held when a worker believes there may be people in the region who would be receptive to the church's message. ; '''' : Participation in this closedSee: * ; * ; * . meeting is generally restricted to members. It is usually held in the home of an elder, and consists of a cappella singing from the regular hymnal, partaking of communion emblems (a piece of leavened bread and a cup of wine or grape juice), prayer and sharing of testimonies by members in good standing. ; '''' : Participation in this closed meeting is generally restricted to members, and is usually held in the home of an elder. Members are assigned a list of Bible verses or a topic of study for consideration during the week, for discussion at the next meeting. As the meeting progresses, each member shares thoughts regarding the scripture or topic. Thoughts are shared by individual members in turn, and members do not engage in discussions during the meeting. The Bible study meeting includes hymns and prayers. ; '''' : This is a monthly gathering of several congregations, and follows the format of the Sunday morning meetings. Union meetings are not open to the public. ;'''' : Special meetings are annual gatherings of members from a large area. Each is held as a private gathering, often in a rented hall. Special meetings last a single day, and include sermons by local and visiting workers. The sermons are interspersed with prayers, hymns, and testimonies. ; '''' : These annual events are attended by members from within a larger geographical area than for the special meetings. Conventions are held over several days, usually in rural areas on properties with facilities to handle housing, feeding, and other necessities for those who attend. These services generally follow the format used for special meetings. Conventions are not open to the public, although outsiders often attend by invitation. Although not now usual, members were at one time segregated by sex during services. ; '''' : These gatherings are not open to either the public or general membership. Attendance and participation are restricted to workers and certain invited members. The meeting may be a regular Bible study, or it may be used to disseminate any instructions from senior workers or to issue decisions about controversial matters. They are held during conventions, or as necessary. These meetings include prayer, a period for testimonies from any workers wishing to share, and may include statements by senior workers in attendance. = Organisation = Members claim the church does not have a formal organization.See: * ; * Overseer Charles Steffen quoted in ; * . Members do not participate in, and many are unaware of, the church's governance. Although in the early years of the church, a headquarters was maintained in Belfast, no official headquarters currently exist and the church remains largely unincorporated. Both expenditures and funds collected remain secret from the membership and no accounting is made public. Funds are handled through stewardships, trusts, and cash transactions. No materials are published by the church for outside circulation other than invitations to open Gospel meetings. Printed materials are published for circulation among the members and include sermon notes, convention notes, Bible study lists, convention lists, and worker lists. Some members of the group see the internal dissemination of worker letters as continuing the practice of the early Church and the epistolary work of the original apostles. = Hierarchy = The church is controlled by a small group of senior male overseers with each having oversight of a specific geographic region. Under each senior overseer are male head workers who have oversight of a single state, province or similar area, depending on the country.See: * ; * ; * ; * . These head workers handle the two-by-two pairing and field assignments of workers for that area. Each pair of workers has charge over several local meetings with the senior worker of the two having authority over his junior. Local meetings are hosted in the homes of elders who report to the workers. Correspondence such as reporting, finances, and instructions are often communicated according to the set hierarchy. The administration of the church and its annual process of assigning of workers to fields are rarely discussed among the membership. = Hymnals = The church's first hymnal, The Go- Preacher's Hymn Book, had been compiled by 1909, and contained 125 hymns. The English-language hymn book currently used is Hymns Old and New and was first published in 1913 with several subsequent editions and translations. It contains 412 hymns, many of which were written or adapted by workers and other members of the church and is organized into \\"gospel\\" and \\"fellowship\\" hymns. A smaller, second hymnal, also titled Hymns Old and New, consists of the first 170 songs found in the full hymnal. Another version of the hymn book contains words without musical notation and is used primarily by children and those who cannot read music. Hymn books in other languages, such as \\"Himnos\\" in Spanish, contain many hymns translated from English and sung to the same tunes, as well as original non-English hymns.

She is best remembered for her role as Gwen French in Some Came Running (1958), for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Her autobiography, Finding My Way: A Hollywood Memoir, was published in 1990. Personal life Martha Hyer was born in Fort Worth, Texas into a wealthy family, the daughter of Julien Capers Hyer (1894‚Äì1974), an attorney and judge, and Agnes Rebecca (n√©e Barnhart; 1892‚Äì1969). She was the middle of three sisters, with Agnes Ann (1920‚Äì2014) and Jeanne (b. 1928). The Hyers were active in the Methodist church where her father was a highly respected Sunday school teacher. Hyer graduated from Arlington Heights High School and then from Northwestern University with a degree in drama. She was in the sorority Pi Beta Phi with actress Patricia Neal. She then moved to California to study at the Pasadena Playhouse, and soon after was signed to a film contract with RKO. She was married twice, first to producer C. Ray Stahl and later to producer Hal B. Wallis. She converted to Judaism, Wallis's religion, after their marriage. Wallis and Hyer remained together until his death in 1986. Hyer and Wallis contributed funds towards the construction of ‚ÄúThe Hal and Martha Hyer Wallis Theatre‚Äù, a black box theater, at Northwestern University. She had no children. Film and television Battle Hymn (1957) trailer Hyer's first film appearance was an uncredited speaking part in The Locket (1946). She appeared in uncredited and bit roles in B-movies for the next few years, occasionally working on television as well. Eventually, she moved up the ranks, and starting in 1954, began receiving better roles, becoming a popular actress in Hollywood for the next decade. Hyer had a supporting role in the drama So Big (1953), which stars Jane Wyman, and was directed by Robert Wise. She appeared as Janie in \\"Abbott and Costello Go To Mars,\\" which was also released in April. Hyer followed this with westerns, Wyoming Renegades (1954) and The Battle of Rogue River (1954), and a musical comedy, Lucky Me (1954), which stars Doris Day. She then played Elizabeth Tyson, a socialite who almost loses her fianc√© (William Holden) to Audrey Hepburn, in the Oscar- winning film Sabrina (1954). She next starred opposite Donald O'Connor in the comedy Francis in the Navy (1955) and in a 1956 televised version of Jezebel for Lux Video Theatre in which she played the lead role of Julie. She had supporting roles in the war story Battle Hymn (1957) with Rock Hudson and in the drama Mister Cory (1957) with Tony Curtis, directed by Blake Edwards. She was featured in Kelly and Me, a comedy with Van Johnson, and as Cornelia Bullock in the 1957 remake of My Man Godfrey with David Niven. In 1958, Hyer appeared in a Playhouse 90 televised version of Reunion by Merle Miller, along with Frances Farmer. She next appeared in Paris Holiday (1958) with Bob Hope and Houseboat (1958) with Cary Grant. Hyer was the foil for soon-to-be TV icons Dan Rowan and Dick Martin of Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In fame in their Once Upon a Horse... (1958) Western film by Hal Kanter. For the 1958 drama Some Came Running, directed by Vincente Minnelli, Hyer was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Soon after, she had supporting roles in The Big Fisherman (1959) and The Best of Everything (1959) with Joan Crawford. Hyer started the 1960s with a supporting role in Ice Palace (1960), a drama with Richard Burton, and The Last Time I Saw Archie (1961), a comedy with Robert Mitchum. Next she was in A Girl Named Tamiko (1962), Wives and Lovers, and The Carpetbaggers (1964). By 1964, Hyer had turned 40 and after a decade of success, she began having trouble finding good roles and worked mainly in television and in European and American B-films. She did appear in two episodes of The Alfred Hitchcock Hour, ('\\"A Piece Of Action\\" in 1962 and \\"Crimson Witness\\" in 1965). Also in 1965, she was in The Sons of Katie Elder, a Western with John Wayne. She guest-starred on the television series Bewitched as Margaret Marshall, a wealthy, seductive woman. In 1966, she was in The Chase, directed by Arthur Penn. On television, she guest-starred on The Beverly Hillbillies in the episode \\"The Richest Woman\\", in which she plays Tracy Richards, the world's richest woman. In the late 1960s, she starred in the film drama Some May Live the crime comedy The Happening, and the suspense film Crossplot. In 1967, she guest-starred on Family Affair in the episode \\"Star Dust\\", in which she plays Carol Haven, a movie star. Her final film role was in The Day of the Wolves (1971) and her final television role was in a 1974 episode of McCloud. At age 50, she retired from acting, although she later wrote the screenplay to the 1975 western Rooster Cogburn, starring John Wayne and Katharine Hepburn. Retirement and death Hyer enjoyed a quiet retirement through the 1980s and 1990s. She died on May 31, 2014 at the age of 89 from natural causes in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where she had lived for many years.

Service technician Byran Koji Uyesugi shot at eight people; wounding seven fatally (six co-workers and his supervisor). This was the worst mass murder in the history of Hawaii. The shooting At 8:00 in the morning, Byran Koji Uyesugi, a service technician working at Xerox, opened fire inside the building with a semi-automatic pistol, killing his supervisor and six co- workers, and fired in the direction of another co-worker who fled the building. The eighth person escaped without injury. After the shooting, Uyesugi fled in a company van, and by mid-morning, he was found sitting in the van near the Hawaii Nature Center in Makiki, above downtown Honolulu. He held a standoff with police that lasted for five hours, during which he brandished a pistol, read magazines and smoked cigarettes. Adding to the tension of the standoff, the Hawaii Nature Center was hosting thirty-five local school children, who were trapped inside without food or water. Uyesugi surrendered to police at approximately 3:00 p.m. HST. =Victims= * Jason Balatico, 33 * Ford Kanehira, 41 * Ronald Kataoka, 50 * Ronald Kawamae, 54 * Melvin Lee, 58 * Peter Mark, 46 * John Sakamoto, 36 Perpetrator Born in Honolulu in 1959, Byran Koji Uyesugi grew up in the Nuuanu neighborhood. While attending Roosevelt High School, Uyesugi was a member of the school's Army JROTC chapter and the school's rifle team. Classmates remembered him as a quiet student who never got into trouble. According to his brother Dennis, Uyesugi crashed their father's car and hit his head on the windshield shortly after graduating high school in 1977; he was never the same afterwards. Uyesugi had been employed by Xerox as a technician since 1984. Among his hobbies was raising and breeding goldfish and koi, which he would sell to local pet stores. He had an extensive collection of firearms. At the time of the murders he had as many as 25 guns registered in his name, dating to 1982. Police also took eleven handguns, five rifles and two shotguns from Uyesugi's father. According to testimony from Uyesugi's father, Hiroyuki, Uyesugi was normal until he started working for Xerox in 1984. In 1988, Byran started to complain that he had a poking sensation in his head.Barayuga, Debra; Tswei, Suzanne (May 26, 2000). \\"Uyesugi's father, brother tell of torment in his head\\", Honolulu Star- Bulletin.Cole, William (January 17, 2001). \\"Uyesugi defends himself in lawsuit\\", Honolulu Advertiser.Flowers, R. Barri (November 26, 2012). The Dynamics of Murder: Kill or Be Killed, CRC Press, pp. 258 - 261. Google Books. Retrieved February 4, 2014. After being transferred to another workgroup, Uyesugi began making unfounded accusations of harassment and product tampering against fellow repairmen. They had difficulty dealing with him. Former co- workers who knew him reported the other members of his team allegedly ostracized him, making him feel isolated and withdrawn. Uyesugi reportedly made threats against other co-workers' lives. In 1993, he was ordered to undergo psychiatric evaluation and anger management courses after he kicked in and damaged an elevator door. Uyesugi was arrested for third-degree criminal property damage. Co-workers told Dr. Michael Welner, chairman of the Forensic Panel and the forensic psychiatrist who interviewed Uyesugi prior to trial, that as early as 1995, Uyesugi was openly talking of carrying out a mass shooting at the workplace were he to be fired. He complained that his co- workers were engaged in patterns of harassment, backstabbing behavior, and spreading of rumors. In the period leading up to the shootings, Xerox management had become increasingly committed to phasing out the type of photocopier that Uyesugi serviced. He resisted learning the replacement machine, fearing that he could not keep up with its technical demands. After working around his refusal to train on the new machine, Uyesugi's manager insisted on November 1, 1999 that he would begin training the next day. In his interview with Dr. Michael Welner, who examined Uyesugi when the defendant brought an insanity defense, Uyesugi said he had believed that if he refused to take the training, management would fire him. He told Dr. Welner, \\"I decided to give them a reason to fire me.\\" Trial and incarceration Forty- year-old Byran Uyesugi's month-long trial began on May 15, 2000. He was charged with one count of murder in the first degree (count 1), seven counts of murder in the second degree (counts 2-8), and one count of attempted murder in the second degree (count 9). Prior to the close of the trial, counts 2-8 were merged into count 1. The Prosecuting Attorney of Honolulu Peter Carlisle and Deputy Prosecuting Attorneys Christopher Van Marter and Kevin Takata represented the State of Hawaii. Criminal Defense Attorneys Jerel Fonseca and Rodney Ching of the law firm Fonseca & Ching represented Uyesugi. Uyesugi pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity and claimed that he felt like an outcast at work and that he feared his colleagues were conspiring to have him fired. Dr. Park Dietz and Dr. Daryl Matthews testified for the defense that he was insane, citing the delusions about how others were tampering with his fish. Lead prosecution expert witness Dr. Harold Hall testified that the Defendant fulfilled the criteria for a diagnosis of schizophrenia, but he did not meet the criteria for either insanity or extreme emotion or mental disturbance (EMED). Dr. Michael Welner testified for the prosecution that although Mr. Uyesugi was in his opinion a schizophrenic, he carried out the shooting because he was angry that he would be fired for insubordination, and that his own account of concealment before the crime demonstrated that he knew what he had done was wrong. On June 13, 2000, the jury rejected the insanity defense, finding Uyesugi guilty on count 1 for the seven murders and count 9 for the attempted murder. On August 8, 2000, Judge Marie N. Milks sentenced Uyesugi to life without the possibility of parole for count 1 and life with the possibility of parole on count 9, with the sentences to run consecutively. The court also ordered Uyesugi to pay $500 in restitution and $70,000 to the crime victim compensation fund. Hawaii does not have the death penalty. The parole board later ordered Uyesugi to serve a minimum term of 235 years in prison, the longest ever ordered for a Hawaii inmate. Uyesugi appealed his convictions. In 2002, the State of Hawaii Supreme Court upheld Uyesugi's conviction. In 2004, Uyesugi was considering fighting his conviction based on Rule 40, inadequate representation by his lawyers in his first trial. In 2005, Xerox and the hospital that examined Uyesugi settled a civil lawsuit brought by the families of the shooting victims. They believed that both parties had failed to take preventive action based on what they said were clear signs of Uyesugi's mental instability. Uyesugi was incarcerated at the Saguaro Correctional Center in Eloy, Arizona. Aftermath Xerox vacated the premises at 1200 N. Nimitz Highway after the shooting. This facility was vacant until 2004, when the producers of the TV show Lost built a sound stage there to film indoor scenes. Dal-Tile currently leases the property from the Weinberg Foundation for its tile and natural stone showroom. The state legislature passed a law that requires doctors to reveal information about the mental state of persons applying to buy guns.

Brake runs may be located anywhere along the circuit of a coaster and may be designed to bring the train to a complete halt or to simply adjust the train's speed. Contrary to some belief, the vast majority of roller coasters do not have any form of braking on the train itself, but rather forms of braking that exist on track sections. One notable exception is the Scenic Railway roller coaster, which relies on an operator to manually control the speed of the train. On most roller coasters, the brakes are controlled by a computer system. Some older coasters have manually operated friction or skid brakes, some with a pneumatic assist. These are either engaged at the control panel or operated by pulling or pushing large levers in the station.  Trim brakes  Trim brakes are sections of brakes which are intended to adjust a train's speed during its course rather than bring the train to a complete stop. They may be engineered into a ride at its design stages at certain anticipated troubled spots, or later retrofitted once it is discovered that trains traverse certain areas at higher-than-anticipated speeds. Trim brakes are often either added for safety reasons, to lower g-forces in certain areas, or for maintenance/mechanical reasons, to lower the cost of wear-and-tear damage (especially on wooden roller coasters) caused by the trains traveling at faster than normal speeds. Usually, a proximity sensor precedes the trim brake in order to identify the current speed of the passing train. From this, the trim will then grab the train's brake fins to reduce the train's speed to that set by the control system.  Block brakes  Block brakes are sections of brakes located on any roller coaster wherever more than one train is intended to run. They act as virtual barriers between the trains running on the roller coaster, preventing collisions should one train stop along the course for any reason. Block brakes must be capable of completely stopping the train (should a vehicle preceding the block stop) and starting a train (after it has been stopped). Block brake sections usually start the train again either by using a slight downward slope to let gravity take its course, or by using drive tires to push the train out of the block. Like trim brakes, block brakes can also be used to control the speed of the train. These are usually known as mid-course brake runs. An example of a mid-course brake run is on Titan at Six Flags Over Texas, which consists of such a brake run (which slows the train down drastically, almost to the point of stopping) due to the severe G-forces in its downward 540-degree helix following the brake run. Mid-course brake runs give more time for another train to be loaded. Quite often, mid-course brake runs give so much time that another train can be fitted onto the track without the worry of bumping.  Types of brakes  Various types of braking exist when dealing with roller coasters, some of which have been recently developed due to technological advancements in design. Thunderbolt at Kennywood = Skid brakes = Skid brakes essentially involve a long piece of material, often ceramic-covered, situated in the middle of the track parallel to the rails. When the brake is engaged, the skid raises and friction against the underside of the train causes the train to slow and eventually stop. Skid brakes were one of the first advancements in roller coaster braking and are typically not utilized in modern creations with the exception of Twister at Knoebels Amusement Resort in Elysburg, PA and the Matterhorn at Disneyland in California. Schwarzkopf roller coasters, such as Scorpion at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay Friction brakes on Speed: No Limits at Oakwood Theme Park = Fin brakes = Fin brakes involve a metal fin being attached to the underside of a train. The track is fitted with two computer- controlled squeezing mechanisms which upon closing, squeeze the fin and either slow or stop the train. Fin brakes are the most common form of brakes on roller coasters today. Sometimes they are thick metal box beams (mostly on Bolliger & Mabillard roller coasters); others are thin metal plates. They slide between pairs of friction pads similar to automotive brake pads. Fin brakes are designed to be fail-safe, so that a loss of power will cause them to engage. Brakes are constructed according to a certain measure of redundancy, meaning the ride is usually fitted with one extra set of brakes to bring the train to a hold even if one brake fails. Opening is done by a bellows type of air-operated actuator. Each set of brakes is fitted with its own air supply system controlled by supply valves which open the brake when it is safe to do so. A heavy spring, usually made of steel, is used to hold the brake closed by default. = Magnetic brakes = Magnetic brakes are a relatively new technology that are beginning to gain popularity due to their high degree of safety. Rather than slowing a train via friction (such as fin or skid brakes), which can often be affected by various elements such as rain, magnetic brakes rely completely on certain magnetic properties and resistance. In fact, magnetic brakes never come in contact with the train. Magnetic brakes are made up of one or two rows of neodymium magnets. When a metal fin (typically copper or a copper/aluminum alloy) passes between the rows of magnets, eddy currents are generated in the fin, which creates a magnetic force opposing the fin's motion. The resultant braking force is directly proportional to the speed at which the fin is moving through the brake element. This very property, however, is also one of magnetic braking's disadvantages in that the eddy force itself can never completely hold a train in ideal condition. It is then often necessary to hold the train in place with an additional set of fin brakes or \\"kicker wheels\\" which are simple rubber tires that make contact with the train and effectively park it. Magnetic brakes can be found in two configurations: * The brake elements are mounted to the track or alongside the track and the fins are mounted to the underside or sides of the train. This configuration looks similar to frictional fin brakes. * The fins are mounted to the track and the brake elements are mounted to the underside of the train. This configuration can be found on Intamin's Accelerator Coasters (also known as Rocket Coasters) such as Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure. Magnetic brakes are silent and are much smoother than friction brakes, gradually increasing the braking power so that the people on the ride do not experience rapid changes in deceleration. Many modern roller coasters, especially those being manufactured by Intamin, have utilized magnetic braking for several years. Another major roller coaster designer implementing these brakes is Bolliger & Mabillard in 2004 on their Silver Bullet inverted coaster, making it the first inverted roller coaster to feature magnetic brakes, and again used them on their newer projects, such as Leviathan at Canada's Wonderland. These later applications have proven effectively comfortable and relevant for these inverted coasters which often give the sense of flight. There also exist third party companies such as Magnetar Technologies Corp. which provide various configurations of the technology to be used to replace and retrofit braking systems on existing roller coasters to increase safety, improve rider comfort, and lower maintenance costs and labor. Speed, located before the friction brakes. These track-mounted fins can be retracted to allow the train to pass without slowing it down. A disadvantage of magnetic brakes is that they cannot completely stop a train, and as such cannot be used as block brakes. They also cannot be conventionally disengaged like other types of brakes. Instead, the fins or magnets must be retracted so that the fins no longer pass between the magnets. Accelerator Coasters, for example, have a series of magnetic brake fins located on the launch track. When the train is launched, the brakes are retracted to allow the train to reach its full speed.

An increase of the eustatic sea level can be generated by decreasing glaciation, increasing spreading rates of the mid-ocean ridges or more mid- oceanic ridges. Conversely, increasing glaciation, decreasing spreading rates or fewer mid-ocean ridges lead to a fall of the eustatic sea level. Changes in the eustatic sea level lead to changes in accommodation and therefore affect the deposition of sediments in marine environments. Eustatic (global) sea level refers to the sea level change of the volume of Earth‚Äôs oceans. This is not a physical level but instead represents the sea level if all of the water in the oceans were contained in a single basin. Eustatic sea level is not relative to local surfaces, because relative sea level is dependent on many factors including tectonics, continental rise and subsidence. Eustatic sea level follows the ‚Äòbathtub approach‚Äô which describes the ocean as a single bathtub. One can add or remove water and Earth‚Äôs oceans will gain or lose water globally. Differences of eustatic sea level are caused by three main factors: * Changes in total ocean water mass, for instance, by ice sheet runoff. When an ice sheet such as Greenland begins to lose its ice mass due to melt, the liquid water is transported to the ocean. According to the ‚Äòbathtub approach‚Äô, ice sheet runoff from Greenland will affect eustatic sea level in all areas of the world, whether nearby or distant. Ocean water mass may also shrink in size if the continental ice sheets grow in size, thereby removing liquid water from oceans and converting them to grow ice sheets Penn State 2018 * Changes in the size of the ocean basin, for instance, by tectonic seafloor spreading or by sedimentation. These slow processes can cause the total volume of the oceanic basin to change. * Density changes of the water, for instance, by thermal expansion. Warming will cause water to experience greater molecular motion, thus increasing the volume a molecule will occupy. Expansion of water may also be caused by changes in ocean salinity. As continental ice accumulates, the ocean water freezes onto land but the salt it carried will mostly remain in the ocean. Thus, as ice sheets increase, ocean salinity also increases (and vice versa). An increase in salinity will increase the density of the ocean basin. Melting of ice sheets and a decrease of ocean salinity will effectively decrease the density of the water. These two effects together are called the steric sea level. The thermal part is called the thermosteric sea level, whereas the salinity part is called the halosteric sea level.

McGraw-Hill) The Joys of Yiddish is a book containing a lexicon of common words and phrases of Yinglish‚Äîi.e., words originating in the Yiddish language that had become known to speakers of American English due to the influence of American Ashkenazi Jews. It was originally published in 1968 and written by Leo Rosten. The book distinguished itself by how it explained the meaning of the Yiddish words and phrases: almost every entry was illustrated by a joke. This made the book not only a useful reference, but also a treasured collection of Jewish humor. As is inevitable with any book that references popular culture, it quickly became dated due to the dramatic changes that American culture (and Jewish-American culture) underwent over the next 30 years. Rosten published revised versions of the book with different titles: Hooray for Yiddish! (1982) and The Joys of Yinglish (1989). In 2001, a new edition of the original book was published. Titled The New Joys of Yiddish, it was revised by Lawrence Bush, with copious footnotes added to clarify passages that had become outdated. Some material was also rearranged. References in popular culture In 1998, Charles Schumer and Al D'Amato were running for the position of United States Senator representing New York. During the race, D'Amato referred to Schumer as a putzhead. The New York Times referenced the entry for putz in The Joy of Yiddish and maintained that the phrase did not merely mean \\"fool\\", as D'Amato insisted, but was significantly more pejorative: based on that entry, a better translation might be \\"dickhead\\". D'Amato ended up losing the race; some observers credit this incident with costing him the election. Harlan Ellison's 1974 science fiction story \\"I'm Looking for Kadak\\" (collected in Ellison's 1976 book Approaching Oblivion and in Wandering Stars: An Anthology of Jewish Fantasy and Science Fiction) is narrated by an eleven-armed Jewish alien from the planet Zsouchmuhn with an extensive Yiddish vocabulary. Ellison courteously provides a \\"Grammatical Guide and Glossary for the Goyim\\" in which, he says, \\"The Yiddish words are mine ... but some of the definitions have been adapted and based on those in Leo Rosten's marvelous and utterly indispensable sourcebook The Joys of Yiddish ... which I urge you to rush out and buy, simply as good reading.\\" Dave McKean and Neil Gaiman's 2005 fantasy film MirrorMask includes Rosten's classic riddle, discussed in The Joys of Yiddish as follows: > The first riddle I ever heard, one familiar to almost every Jewish child, > was propounded to me by my father: \\"What is it that hangs on the wall, is > green, wet -- and whistles?\\" I knit my brow and thought and thought, and in > final perplexity gave up. \\"A herring,\\" said my father. \\"A herring,\\" I > echoed. \\"A herring doesn't hang on the wall!\\" \\"So hang it there.\\" \\"But a > herring isn't green!\\" I protested. \\"Paint it.\\" \\"But a herring isn't wet.\\" > \\"If it's just painted it's still wet.\\" \\"But -- \\" I sputtered, summoning all > my outrage, \\"-- a herring doesn't whistle!!\\" \\"Right, \\" smiled my father. \\"I > just put that in to make it hard.\\" John Updike's final novel in the Rabbit series, Rabbit at Rest, copies Rosten's joke from the entry on tsuris.

Development Unveiled by the U.S. Air Force on 30 April 1996, the Tacit Blue Technology Demonstration Program was designed to prove that such an aircraft could continuously monitor the ground situation deep behind the battlefield and provide targeting information in real time to a ground command center. Pave Mover radar antenna In December 1976, DARPA and the U.S. Air Force initiated the Battlefield Surveillance Aircraft-Experimental (BSAX) program, which was part of a larger Air Force program called Pave Mover. The BSAX program's goal was to develop an efficient stealth reconnaissance aircraft with a low probability of intercept radar and other sensors that could operate close to the forward line of battle with a high degree of survivability. Tacit Blue represented the \\"black\\" component in the larger \\"Assault Breaker\\" program, which intended to validate the concept of massed standoff attacks on advancing armoured formations using smart munitions. The Pave Mover radar demonstrators provided the non-stealth portion of the program's targeting system, whereas Tacit Blue was intended to demonstrate a similar but stealth capability, while validating a number of innovative stealth technology advances.Assault Breaker Program Analysis. The radar sensor technology developed for Tacit Blue evolved into the radar now being used by the E-8 Joint STARS aircraft. Design Northrop's B-2 chief scientist John Cashen was quoted in 1996 as having said, \\"You're talking about an aircraft that at the time was arguably the most unstable aircraft man had ever flown.\\" Tacit Blue, nicknamed \\"the whale\\" (and sometimes also called an \\"alien school bus\\" for its only slightly rounded-off rectangular shape), featured a straight tapered wing with a V-tail mounted on an oversized fuselage with a curved shape. It was the first stealth aircraft to feature curved surfaces for radar cross-section reduction. Northrop would use this stealth technology on the B-2 bomber. A single flush inlet on the top of the fuselage provided air to two medium-bypass turbofan engines. Tacit Blue employed a quadruply redundant digital fly-by-wire flight control system to help stabilize the aircraft about its longitudinal and directional axes. Operational history Northrop Tacit Blue cockpit The aircraft made its first successful flight on February 5, 1982, in Area 51, at Groom Lake, Nevada, flown by Northrop test pilot Richard G. Thomas. The aircraft subsequently logged 135 flights over a three-year period. The aircraft often flew three to four flights weekly and several times flew more than once a day. Another Tacit Blue test pilot, Ken Dyson, told CNN in 2014 that Northrop had manufactured additional major components for the jet, which amounted to half of a second plane. \\"If we lost one, we could have a second one up and flying in short order,\\" Dyson said. After reaching about 250 flight hours, the aircraft was placed in storage in 1985. In 1996, after Tacit Blue was declassified, it was placed on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, near Dayton, Ohio and has been on display in the new fourth hangar at the museum since June 2016.National Museum of the USAF Fact Sheet Specifications See also References External links * Tacit Blue at National Museum of USAF * Tacit Blue: The Creation of Stealth Category:Stealth aircraft Category:1980s United States experimental aircraft Category:Code names Tacit Blue Category:V-tail aircraft Category:Low-wing aircraft Category:Twinjets ","title":"Northrop Tacit Blue"},{"id":"1268318","text":"Renato Russo (born Renato Manfredini, Jr., March 27, 1960 ‚Äì October 11, 1996) was a Brazilian singer and songwriter. He was the lead singer of the alternative rock band Legi√£o Urbana. A Brazilian film depicting his life and career was released in 2013, called Somos T√£o Jovens.  Childhood  Renato Manfredini Jr. was born in Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro. He started his studies at an early age, at Col√©gio Olavo Billac. During this period he wrote an essay entitled \\"Old house, in ruins\\". His father was an executive at Banco do Brasil, and the family moved to Forest Hills, Queens, New York in 1967, when he was assigned a job in the city. Renato and his family returned later to Rio de Janeiro and moved in with his uncle S√°vio. At 18 years old, he came out as bisexual to his mother, and in 1988 he made it public by writing the song \\"Meninos e Meninas\\" (\\"Boys n' Girls\\") with the chorus stating, in English, \\"I like St. Paul, I like St. John, I like St. Francis and St. Sebastian, and I like boys and girls.\\"  Adolescence  In 1973, his family moved from Rio de Janeiro to Bras√≠lia, Distrito Federal, moving to the \\"Asa Sul\\" sector. In 1975, aged 15, Renato went through one of the hardest phases of his life when he was diagnosed as suffering from epiphysiolysis, a bone disease. He underwent surgery and had three platinum pins implanted in his pelvis. He suffered greatly throughout his convalescence, being confined to bed for 6 months, almost immobile. While he was under treatment, he did little more than listening to music, collecting an extensive and varied album collection. In an interview, Renato stated that this period was crucial in shaping his musical ear.  Musical career  Renato in 1987 During the years of 1978 and 1979, he was the bass player of punk rock band Aborto El√©trico (Electric Abortion) which lasted 4 years, from 1978 to 1982, but broke up due to constant arguing between F√™ Lemos, the drummer, and Renato. Although the band did not last long, during this period Renato Russo wrote many songs that would later become hits of Capital Inicial (founded by the remaining members of Aborto El√©trico) and Legi√£o Urbana (founded by Renato Russo). After the end of Aborto El√©trico, Renato began a solo career as the \\"Trovador Solit√°rio\\" (Lonely Minstrel). This period only lasted a few months, as in 1982, he joined Marcelo Bonf√° (the drummer of the band Dado e o Reino Animal), Eduardo Paran√° (guitar player, known as Kadu Lambach) and Paulo Guimar√£es (keyboard player, known as Paulo Paulista) to form Legi√£o Urbana. Renato was the lead vocal and bass player. Their main influences were the post punk bands of the time, especially Robert Smith from The Cure and Morrissey from The Smiths. After the first few concerts, Eduardo Paran√° and Paulo Paulista left the band. Dado Villa-Lobos then took over the guitars, creating the classic line-up of the band. The band also had Renato Rocha as a bass player from 1984 to 1989. Leading Legi√£o Urbana, Renato Russo reached the peak of his career as a musician, being recognized as the most important songwriter of Brazilian rock, securing a cult status within his fanbase. He used to write long songs. The Dylan-esque \\"Faroeste Caboclo\\", for instance, lasts 9:05, \\"Clarisse\\" is 10:33 long and \\"Metal Contra as Nuvens\\" is 11:29 minutes. The song \\"F√°tima\\" was written in ten minutes. He recorded two solo albums, with both English and Italian songs, in the 1990s. Death Renato Russo died on October 11, 1996, at 1:15 a.m., weighing only 45 kilograms (99.2 pounds), due to complications caused by AIDS (he had been HIV-positive since 1989, but never revealed it publicly). He left a son, Giuliano Manfredini, at the time 7 years old. His body was cremated and the ashes were spread at the Parque Burle Marx in S√£o Paulo ‚Äì coincidentally, Legi√£o Urbana's ex-bassist Renato Rocha was hanging out with his girlfriend at the moment of the ashes' spreading and he got a flat tire right in front of the park. On October 22, 1996, eleven days after his death, Dado and Bonf√° announced the end of Legi√£o Urbana. The band's estimated sales in Brazil during Renato's life amounted to roughly 25 million albums. More than a decade after his death, sales of his albums are still considerable.

It was built by Henninger Brewery (now part of the Binding Brewery/Radeberger Group) and had a storage capacity of 16,000 tons of barley. The , 33-storey, reinforced concrete tower was designed by Karl Lieser and was built from 1959 to 1961. It was inaugurated on 18 May 1961. It was demolished in 2013. Until 1974 it was the tallest building in Frankfurt; and it remained the tallest storage silo in the world until its demolition. On top of the building was a barrel-like pod which contained a viewing platform and a revolving restaurant (originally two). On October 2002, the tower was closed to the public. From 1961 to 2008, the annual professional cycling race Rund um den Henninger-Turm was held on 1 May, the course circling the tower multiple times.  Neuer Henninger Turm  In November 2012, it was announced that Henninger Turm would be demolished because it was too costly and uneconomic for renovation. Demolition began in January 2013 and was completed by the end of the year. On its site a new tall residential tower was built. Being inspired by the former Henniger Turm, the design was conceived by the architects Meixner Schl√ºter Wendt. Whereas both the contours and the side facing the city are strongly reminiscent of the original appearance of the old silo, the three other sides clearly indicate the new building‚Äôs function as a residential tower. The design was inspired by the old Henninger Turm. It contains 209 luxury apartments. The cornerstone for this project was laid in June 2014 and the tower was completed in summer 2017.

Produced for air defence purposes by the Royal Australian Air Force. The map includes many of the air fields which were targeted by Japanese aircraft. Between February 1942 and November 1943, during the Pacific War of World War II, the Australian mainland, domestic airspace, offshore islands and coastal shipping were attacked at least 111 times by aircraft from the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Force and Imperial Japanese Army Air Force. These attacks came in various forms; from large-scale raids by medium bombers, to torpedo attacks on ships, and to strafing runs by fighters. In the first and deadliest set of attacks, 242 aircraft hit Darwin on the morning of 19 February 1942. Killing at least 235 people and causing immense damage, the attacks made hundreds of people homeless and resulted in the abandonment of Darwin as a major naval base. These attacks were opposed by, and often aimed at, units and personnel from the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), Australian Army, Royal Australian Navy, United States Army Air Forces, United States Navy, British Royal Air Force and Royal Netherlands East Indies Air Force. Japanese aircrews also targeted civil infrastructure, including harbours, civil airfields, railways and fuel tanks. Some civilians were also killed. Although the main defence was provided by RAAF and Allied fighters, a number of Australian Army anti-aircraft batteries in northern Australia were also involved in dealing with the threat of Japanese air raids. Early Japanese air raids The Japanese conducted a series of air raids on Australia during February and March 1942. These raids sought to prevent the Allies from using bases in northern Australia to contest the conquest of the Netherlands East Indies. =The first air raid on Darwin= The explosion of the MV Neptuna, hit during the first Japanese air raid on Darwin.

The bombing of Darwin on 19 February 1942 was both the first and the largest attack mounted by Japan against mainland Australia, when four Japanese aircraft carriers (, , and ) launched a total of 188 aircraft from a position in the Timor Sea.Tom Lewis (2003). A War at Home. A Comprehensive guide to the first Japanese attacks on Darwin. Tall Stories, Darwin. Page 16. These 188 naval aircraft inflicted heavy damage on Darwin and sank eight ships. A raid conducted by 54 land-based army bombers later the same day inflicted further damage on the town and RAAF Base Darwin and resulted in the destruction of 20 military aircraft. Allied casualties were 235 killed and between 300 and 400 wounded, the majority of whom were non- Australian Allied sailors. Only four Japanese aircraft (all navy carrier- borne) were confirmed to have been destroyed by Darwin's defenders.David Jenkins (1992), Battle Surface!

Pages 63‚Äì71. =The attack on Broome= On 3 March 1942, nine Japanese A6M2 Zero fighters attacked the town of Broome, in northern Western Australia. Although Broome was a small town, it had become a significant air base and route of escape for refugees and retreating military personnel, following the Japanese invasion of Java. During the attack, which consisted of strafing runs only by the Zeros, at least 88 Allied civilians and military personnel were killed and 24 aircraft were lost. As Broome was almost undefended, Japanese losses were light, with only a single Zero being shot down over Broome and another one failing to reach its base.Coulthard-Clark (2001), pp. 211‚Äì212. Attacks on north Queensland, July 1942 Two Australian soldiers searching for fragments of a bomb dropped during the third raid on Townsville. Japanese naval flying boats conducted four small air raids on the north Queensland towns of Townsville and Mossman in late July 1942. Townsville, which was an important military base, was raided by Japanese Kawanishi H8K1 \\"Emily\\" flying boats operating from Rabaul on three nights in late July 1942. On the night of 25/26 July, the town was attacked by two flying boats but did not suffer any damage as the six bombs dropped by these aircraft fell into the sea. Townsville was attacked for the second time in the early hours of 28 July when a single flying boat dropped eight bombs which landed in bushland outside the town. Six P-39 Airacobras unsuccessfully attempted to intercept the Japanese aircraft. The third raid on Townsville occurred in the early hours of 29 July when a single flying boat again attacked the town, dropping seven bombs into the sea and an eighth which fell on an agricultural research station at Oonoonba, damaging a coconut plantation. This aircraft was intercepted by four Airacobras and was damaged.

It separates the Pacific Plate to the west from (north to south) the North American Plate, the Rivera Plate, the Cocos Plate, the Nazca Plate, and the Antarctic Plate. It runs south from the Gulf of California in the Salton Sea basin in Southern California to a point near 55¬∞ S, 130¬∞ W, where it joins the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge trending west-southwest towards Antarctica, near New Zealand (though in some uses the PAR is regarded as the southern section of the EPR). Much of the rise lies about 3200 km (2000 mi) off the South American coast and rises about 1,800‚Äì2,700 m (6,000‚Äì9,000 ft) above the surrounding seafloor.  Overview  21 degrees north. Base of \\"black smoker\\" chimney The oceanic crust is moving away from the East Pacific Rise to either side. Near Easter Island the rate is over per year which is the fastest in the world. However, on the northern end, it is much slower at only roughly per year.\\"Understanding plate motions\\", USGS. Retrieved 26 June 2013.Britannica On the eastern side of the rise the eastward moving Cocos and Nazca plates meet the westward moving South American Plate and the North American Plate and are being subducted under them. The belt of volcanos along the Andes and the arc of volcanoes through Central America and Mexico are the direct results of this collision. Due east of the Baja California Peninsula, the Rise is sometimes referred to as the Gulf of California Rift Zone. In this area, newly formed oceanic crust is intermingled with rifted continental crust originating from the North American Plate. Near Easter Island, the East Pacific Rise meets the Chile Rise at the Easter Island and Juan Fernandez microplates, trending off to the east where it subducts under the South American Plate at the Peru‚ÄìChile Trench along the coast of southern Chile. The southern extension of the East Pacific Rise (called the Pacific- Antarctic Ridge) merges with the Southeast Indian Ridge at the Macquarie Triple Junction south of New Zealand. Parts of the East Pacific Rise have oblique spreading, that is seafloor spreading that is not orthogonal to the nearest ridge segment. Along the East Pacific Rise the hydrothermal vents called black smokers were first discovered by the RISE project in 1979, and have since been extensively studied. These vents are forming volcanogenic massive sulfide ore deposits on the ocean floor. Many unique deep-water creatures have been found with vents, that subsist in a chemosynthetic ecosystem rather than one using photosynthesis. The southern stretch of the East Pacific Rise is one of the fastest-spreading sections of the Earth's mid- ocean ridge system.

BAG is known for the convergence of free jazz and experimental theater.  Members  Members included saxophonists Julius Hemphill, Oliver Lake, J. D. Parran, Hamiet Bluiett, and Luther Thomas; trumpeters Baikida Carroll and Floyd LeFlore; trombonist Joseph Bowie; drummers Bensid Thigpen and Charles \\"Bobo\\" Shaw; bassist Bobby Reed, ArziniaRichardson; stage directors Malinke Robert Elliott, Vincent Terrell, and Muthal Naidoo; actors LeRoi S. Shelton; poets Ajule (Bruce) Rutlin and Shirley LeFlore; dancers Georgia Collins and Luisah Teish; and painters Emilio Cruz and Oliver L. Jackson. While Jackson was not officially a member, he was deeply involved with BAG and is usually listed as a member. In addition, Ronnie Burrage was considered one of the youngest members (11 and 12 years old) of BAG as he began to perform with various members in 1971 and '72.  History  Members Oliver Lake, Lester Bowie, and Floyd LeFlore studied music in the jazz program at Sumner High School. They continued music education at Lincoln University alongside Julius Hemphill. Several members were drafted into military service, and all played music in St. Louis through the 1960s. Frustration with discrimination and limited opportunities brought the musical artists together with black actors marginalized from the theater scene, and they began collaborating on artistic productions around LaClede Town, the Circle Coffee Shop, and Berea Church. While strongly influenced by Chicago's Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians, the Black Artists Group was unique in including artists from dance, theater, visual arts, and creative writing. They incorporated as a not-for-profit organization under the name \\"The Black Artists' Group, Inc\\" in 1968. BAG received major grant funding from the Danforth Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation. In July 1969, the group paid $1 annual rent for a building at 2665 Washington Blvd. Many of the BAG members relocated to Paris and then New York in the 1970s.  Legacy  BAG inspired other groups and artistic collectives to form around the United States and influenced Chicago's Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians. Oliver Lake, Julius Hemphill and Hamiet Bluiett formed the African Continuum and organized the 1971 multimedia concert \\"Images: Sons/Ancestors\\" at Powell Symphony Hall, which was delayed by a bomb threat. They went on to form the World Saxophone Quartet and were notable in the \\"loft-jazz\\" scene of New York's underground in the 1980s.

The award is named after American Wallace Stegner (1909‚Äî1993), a historian, novelist, short story writer, environmentalist, and Stanford faculty member who founded the university's creative writing program. Ten fellowships are awarded every year, five in fiction and five in poetry. The recipients do not need a degree to receive the fellowships, though many fellows already hold the terminal M.F.A. degree in creative writing. A workshop-based program, no degree is awarded after the two-year fellowship. Prior to 1990, many fellows also enrolled in Stanford's now-defunct M.A. program in creative writing. Fellows receive a stipend of $37,500 per year, as well as health insurance and their tuition fee for Stanford. Fellows are required to live close enough to Stanford to be able to attend all workshops, as well as other department-related readings and events. History Stegner founded the Stanford creative writing department and fellowship program in 1946. Initial funding was supplied by Dr. E.H. Jones, brother of the chair of the Stanford English Department, Richard Foster Jones. Initially the fellowship was for three writing fellows per year, many of whom were World War II veterans returning home from overseas. In 1973, then-director John L'Heureux expanded the program to include eight fiction writers and eight poets per year.\\"History of the Stanford Creative Writing Program,\\" Stanford University Creative Writing Program. Accessed Nov. 3, 2012. In 1992, the program expanded again to ten fiction writers and ten poets each year.

The opposite of suspension of judgment is premature judgment, usually shortened to prejudice, or in some philosophical systems such as Pyrrhonism the opposite is dogma. While prejudgment involves drawing a conclusion or making a judgment before having the information relevant to such a judgment, suspension of judgment involves waiting for all the facts before making a decision.  Law  Suspension of judgment is used in civil law to indicate a court's decision to nullify a civil judgment. Motions to set aside judgments entered in civil cases in the United States district courts are governed by Rule 60 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure which opens with the statement, \\"On motion and just terms, the court may relieve a party or its legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding...\\". The rule is quite straightforward and court room application is mostly as stated. In the New York Law Journal David Bliven argues that suspended judgement ought to be an alternative disposition in family offenses (a type of civil case), particularly in cases where a family judgement is being used as behavior modification rather than a reason to arrest. More generally in jurisprudence, the ideal juror is expected to presume innocence of the person tried in court. And in the case of conviction, a suspended sentence is one of the possible sentences available to the court.Suspended sentence law and legal definition from US Legal.com  Science  Suspension of judgment is a cornerstone of standard research methodology. Much of the scientific method is designed to encourage the suspension of judgments until observations can be made, tested, and verified through peer review. In 1877,. Charles Sanders Peirce (1839‚Äì1914) characterized inquiry in general not as the pursuit of truth per se but as the struggle to move from irritating, inhibitory doubts born of surprises, disagreements, and the like, and to reach a secure belief, belief being that on which one is prepared to act. He framed scientific inquiry as part of a broader spectrum and as spurred, like inquiry generally, by actual doubt, not mere verbal or hyperbolic doubt, which he held to be fruitless.\\"What one does not in the least doubt one should not pretend to doubt; but a man should train himself to doubt,\\" said Peirce in a brief intellectual autobiography; see Ketner, Kenneth Laine (2009) \\"Charles Sanders Peirce: Interdisciplinary Scientist\\" in The Logic of Interdisciplinarity). Peirce held that actual, genuine doubt originates externally, usually in surprise, but also that it is to be sought and cultivated, \\"provided only that it be the weighty and noble metal itself, and no counterfeit nor paper substitute\\"; in \\"Issues of Pragmaticism\\", The Monist, v. XV, n. 4, pp. 481‚Äì99, see p. 484, and p. 491. (Reprinted in Collected Papers v. 5, paragraphs 438‚Äì63, see 443 and 451). He believed that the scientific method excels the other methods of reasoning by being designed to eventually arrive at the most secure beliefs. Starting from the idea that people seek not truth per se but instead to subdue irritating, inhibitory doubt, Peirce showed how, through the struggle, some can come to submit to truth for the sake of belief's integrity, seek as truth the guidance of potential practice correctly to its given goal, and wed themselves to the scientific method.Peirce, C.S., Collected Papers v. 5, in paragraph 582, from 1898: The advance of social science often depends on excluding cognitive bias, of which many forms are known.  Philosophy  Within philosophy, suspension of judgment is typically associated with positivism and skepticism, most especially Pyrrhonism where it is referred to as epoch√©, but it is not limited to these areas. The 17th century rationalist Ren√© Descartes, for example, used it as the cornerstone of his epistemology. In a process that he called methodological skepticism (now also known as Cartesian doubt), he asserted that in order to gain a solid foundation when building one's system of knowledge and belief, one must first doubt everything. Only by eliminating preconceptions and prejudgments can one come to know what is true.\\"A Philosophical Glossary\\" edited by Justin Leiber, Philosophy Department, University of Houston, USA. Descartes' methodology is called hyperbolic doubt called so because it's an extreme form of doubt, casting even slightly suspect into the light of further scrutiny. Hyperbolic doubt is posited in four general points: #Only information that you know to be true should be accepted. #Take known truths and break them down into their basic components. #Solve the simplest problems first. #Take the remaining problems and make complete lists of them. Descartes goal in the 1641 Meditations on First Philosophy was to systematically doubt all beliefs and do a ground-up rebuild of only definitely true things as an undoubted basis for the sciences. As an example take a look at the opening line of the volume: Through this work Descartes showed that unless one is very careful there are grounds to doubt the reasoning behind any knowledge. He states that this is mostly due to the unreliable nature of sensory knowledge and makes that case with the examples of the dream and the demon. =The dream argument= Descartes hypothesized that due to the possibility of very realistic dreams humans can only believe that we're awake. Through the systematic procedure of 'phenomenological reduction', one is thought to be able to suspend judgment regarding the general or naive philosophical belief in the existence of the external world, and thus examine phenomena as they are originally given to consciousness.Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. \\"The Phenomenological Reduction\\". However, by the end of The Meditations, he concludes that in retrospect we can certainly distinguish dreaming and reality: > \\"But when I distinctly see where things come from and where and when they > come to me, and when I can connect my perceptions of them with my whole life > without a break then I can be certain that when I encounter these things I > am not asleep but awake.\\" ‚Äî Descartes: Selected Philosophical Writings Dreaming is also a starting position for the speculation that we may living in a simulation. Proponents of this viewpoint will sometimes argue that a particular type of simulated reality occurs nightly. The basic claim is that opponents of the simulation hypothesis that a sleeping mind is an unreliable mechanism for differentiated reality from illusion. = The Evil Demon = The idea of the \\"evil demon\\" (also known as the \\"malicious demon\\" or \\"evil genius\\") is one of several methods of systematic doubt employed in the Meditations. Descartes reasoned that it could be possible for what he referred to as an evil demon to be controlling our experiences. There are some Cartesian scholars whom opine that the demon is omnipotent though omnipotence of the evil demon would be contrary to Descartes' hypothesis, as he rebuked accusations of the demon having omnipotence.

It features Sonic the Hedgehog, Miles \\"Tails\\" Prower, Amy Rose, and Doctor Robotnik. In 1995, a sequel named Sonic Drift 2 was released. Gameplay In-game screenshot, showing Sonic racing on a course themed after Green Hill Zone. In Sonic Drift, players race around a series of tracks in either single races or a Grand Prix consisting of six courses, collecting rings and using power-ups to obtain First Place. Each playable character has different positive and negative attributes, and can utilize a Special Ability at the cost of 2 rings. Sonic, who drives a red and white sports car known as the Cyclone, has great speed and handling but poor control, and has a speed boost as his Special Ability. Tails, who drives a 1960s-era Formula 1 car called the MTP-01 Wheelwind, is well-balanced in terms of his speed, acceleration and handling, but does not stand out in any particular area- he can utilize a powerful jump as his Special Ability, which allows him to avoid obstacles and particularly tough corners. Eggman (as he is referred to in this game), who pilots a modified version of his standard Eggmobile known as the Egg Typhoon, has poor acceleration, but has very high top speed and cornering abilities, and can toss Bombs onto the track that can cause his rivals to spin out. Finally, Amy Rose, who drives a yellow and blue vintage convertible called the Breeze, has great acceleration at the cost of low top speed, and has the ability to attack by throwing small heart-shaped objects that slow down her opponents and alter their controls for a short time. Development and release Sonic Drift was released in Japan for the Game Gear on March 18, 1994. A Western release was planned but canceled due to Sega of America CEO Tom Kalinske‚Äôs concerns regarding its quality. Drift is the first racing game in the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, and was created specifically to rival the success of Nintendo's Super Mario Kart (1992). Early versions of the game featured Flicky, a blue bird that has made frequent appearances throughout the series, as a playable character, who was subsequently replaced by Amy Rose in the final version. The music that plays when collecting a blue invincibility power-up is a sped-up version of the opening song You Can Do Anything from Sonic CD. Drift is also the first Sonic game to feature Amy and Dr. Robotnik as playable characters. The soundtrack was composed by Naofumi Hataya. In 2003, Sonic Drift was ported to the GameCube as an unlockable extra in Sonic Adventure DX: Director's Cut, alongside eleven other Sonic Game Gear games; the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 digital releases of DX omits these. It was compiled into Sonic Mega Collection Plus for the Xbox, PlayStation 2 and PC in 2005, and was digitally re-released for the now-defunct GameTap storefront in 2006. A demo of Drift is also included in Sonic Gems Collection. Reception Sonic Drift received mainly mixed reviews from the press. Japanese publication Famitsu heavily compared the game to Super Mario Kart, feeling that the game was largely uninspired and generally lacking in content compared to Nintendo's game. They were also critical of the game's short horizon, which they claimed made it hard to see what was ahead of the player. Electronic Gaming Monthly was more positive towards it in a preview, saying that the game was fast-paced and enjoyable but the flashing, choppy scrolling hampered the gameplay somewhat. They enjoyed the game's amount of modes, namely the Vs. Mode. Jeuxvideo.com in 2012 also compared the game to Super Mario Kart, disliking Drift for being too simplistic and for being very easy to finish, alongside the general lack of content and poor presentation. They stated: \\"Too simple and too fast to finish, Sonic Drift is unfortunately not a title that will fascinate the crowds.\\" Its inclusion in Sonic Mega Collection was negatively received; GameSpy passingly labeled it as \\"almost unplayable\\", while Eurogamer mockingly called it \\"a terrible, terrible racing game whose flickering madness actually made me physically sick.\\" Retrospectively in 2019, Hardcore Gaming 101 said that the gameplay itself was decent and solid, but felt that it was greatly lacking in content and variety.

Organ tablature is a form of musical notation used by the north German Baroque organ school, although there are also forms of organ tablature from other countries such as Italy, Spain, Poland, and England. Portions of Johann Sebastian Bach's Orgelb√ºchlein are written in tablature, as are a great deal of the surviving manuscripts of the organ works of Dieterich Buxtehude and other north German organ composers of the Baroque era. The first extant example of keyboard tablature, which was almost certainly for organ, was in the Robertsbridge Codex, from about 1360. Although it is English, it is closely related to the later German tablatures. An early and perhaps seminal example of these organ tablatures is found in the Buxheimer Orgelbuch (Buxheim Organ Book), compiled in M√ºnich in the 1460s. It reflects the work of Conrad Paumann, a blind organist, lutenist, and composer.Perkins, Leeman L. Music in the Age of the Renaissance. Norton and Company, New York, 1999. The biggest organ tablature, as well as one of the oldest in the world, is Organ Tablature by Jan of Lublin (1537‚Äì48), one of ca. 20 Polish organ tablatures created from 1520 to 1700. An emblematic organ tablature of the early baroque era is the Linzer Orgeltabulatur, compiled between 1611 and 1613 and containing 108 pieces of mostly non-liturgical character. The feature of organ tablature that distinguishes it from modern musical notation is the absence of staves, noteheads, and key signatures. Pitches are denoted by letter names written in script, durations by flags (much like modern notation), although in early notations durations were shown using mensural indications, and octave displacement by octave lines drawn above a letter. There was some variation in the notation of accidentals, but sometimes sharps were specified by the addition of a loop to the end of the letter. B natural and B flat were represented by h and b respectively.Thurston Dart, John Morehen, Richard Rastall. \\"Tablature\\", Grove Music Online, ed. L. Macy (accessed March 15, 2006), grovemusic.com (subscription access). Naturals are not indicated, as accidentals do not carry through the entire measure as in modern notation. Key signatures are not specified; they are implied by the indicated sharps. In Renaissance works the uppermost melodic line is given in normal mensural notation on a staff, and the tablature given below each note. Since the end of the Baroque era, organ tablature has not been used to an appreciable extent. Repertoire originally written in tablature has been translated into modern notation. However, this translation carries a risk of error. In German script an A and an E can become confused, as can an F and a G. Likewise, an octave line over a series of notes can begin or end ambiguously. Different solutions are given by different editors, and this is one manifestation of the improvisatory tradition of organ performance of the period.

Name One suggestion for the origin of the term was the French phrase jeune d'Anvers (\\"youth of Antwerp\\"). British sailors \\"cockneyed\\" this description into the personal name \\"Jenny Haniver.\\" History Jenny Hanivers have been created to look like devils, angels and dragons. Some writers have suggested the sea monk may have been a Jenny Haniver. The earliest known picture of Jenny Haniver appeared in Konrad Gesner's Historia Animalium vol. IV in 1558. Gesner warned that these were merely disfigured rays and should not be believed to be miniature dragons or monsters, which was a popular misconception at the time. The most common misconception was that Jenny Hanivers were basilisks. As basilisks were creatures that killed with merely a glance, no one could claim to know what one looks like. For this reason it was easy to pass off Jenny Hanivers as these creatures, which were still widely feared in the 16th century.Peter Dance, Animal Fakes and Frauds In Veracruz, Jenny Hanivers are considered to have magical powers and are employed by curanderos in their rituals. This tradition is similar to one in Japan, where fake taxidermy ningyo (similar to Fiji mermaids) were produced and kept in temples.

A launched coaster initiates a ride with high amounts of acceleration via one or a series of linear induction motors (LIM), linear synchronous motors (LSM), catapults, tires, chains, or other mechanisms employing hydraulic or pneumatic power. This mode of acceleration powers many of the fastest rollercoasters in the world. Blue Fire, a launched looping roller coaster at Europa-Park, Germany. Launched coasters mainly feature improved speed and acceleration when compared to traditional chain or cable lift coasters. They can be less reliable, however, and require increased maintenance. The first launched roller coaster was Montezooma's Revenge at Knotts Berry Farm in Southern California. Electromagnetic =LIM / LSM= Linear induction motor (LIM) and linear synchronous motor (LSM) coasters use propulsion via electromagnets, which utilize large amounts of electricity to propel the coaster train along its track into the ride elements (e.g. inversions, twists, turns and short drops). Ten design companies managing these types of rides are Vekoma, Intamin, Gerstlauer, Premier Rides, Maurer, Zierer, Mack Rides, Bolliger & Mabillard , Rocky Mountain Construction and S&S; Worldwide. Both Rocky Mountain Construction and Bolliger & Mabillard established their first LSM launched coasters recently with the RMC Topper Track Coaster, Lightning Rod, at Dollywood, and B&M;'s wingrider, Thunderbird, at HolidayWorld. An example of an LSM launched roller coaster is Maverick at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio. These launch systems transfer electricity through a motor on the roller coaster's track so that it controls the speed at which it will urge the cars and train either forward or backward on a segment. LIMs are mainly used in Premier Rides roller coasters and Intamin impulse and blitz coasters. However, LIMs can also be used for general transport, such as the Tomorrowland Transit Authority PeopleMover in Magic Kingdom or monorail and maglev trains. Fluid pressure =Hydraulic Fluid= Hydraulic-launched roller coasters give the riders high acceleration, yet with improved smoothness, over the electromagnetic and catapult launch mechanisms. The Swiss manufacturer Intamin pioneered this new style. The heart of the system is several (usually eight) powerful hydraulic pumps, each capable of producing around 500 horsepower (373 kW). Hydraulic fluid is pumped into several different hydraulic accumulators (energy storing devices) containing two compartments separated by a piston. As the incompressible hydraulic fluid is pumped into one compartment, nitrogen in the other compartment is compressed. At launch, the fluid under pressure from the accumulators is used to drive a number (typically 16 or 32) of hydraulic motors, which spin a large winch drum that rewinds a cable attached to a catch-car under the train in a matter of seconds. The catch-car moves in a groove in the center of the launch track with the motor at one end, and the waiting train at the other. While the train inches forward, the pusher moves back from the motor towards the train. Once the pusher connects, the anti- rollback braking system drops beneath the track, giving the train the green light to be launched. In the Kingda Ka roller coaster, the system as a whole can produce a peak power of up to 20,800 hp (15.5 MW) for each launch. These launches are considered capable of giving a far greater and smoother acceleration than the LIM/LSM styles. The acceleration from a LIM/LSM launch is greatest at the beginning and dies off rapidly towards the end of the launch, but the acceleration from a hydraulic launch remains nearly constant throughout the launch. The first hydraulic launch coaster was Xcelerator reaching in 2.3 seconds. The world's current tallest and 2nd fastest coaster Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure, which opened in the spring of 2005 is capable of reaching 128 mph (206 km/h) in 3.5 seconds. The fastest roller coaster in the world Formula Rossa, which reaches in 4 seconds, is also launched using this method. Hydraulic launched rides usually have a tower after the launch, with differing layouts afterwards depending on the park's financial resources. Top Thrill Dragster brakes after the tower and Kingda Ka features a single hill after the tower, while Storm Runner at Hersheypark offers a series of overbanked turns and inversions after its 180 foot (55 m) tower drop. Rita at Alton Towers does not have a tower, only airtime hills and banked turns. Stealth at Thorpe Park has a large tower that travels to the left over the top hat, and then slows on an airtime hill with magnetic brakes. Xcelerator at Knotts Berry Farm offers two overbanked turns after the tower. Along with the height and speed, these coasters, named \\"Rocket Coasters\\" in the industry, are considered more comfortable because of a smoother launch than LIM-style launches. A recent newcomer to the hydraulic launch industry is Vekoma, who opened a coaster in 2004 called Booster Bike at Toverland in the Netherlands, said to give riders a sensation of racing on high performance motorcycles over a low twisted layout, at speeds up to 47 mph (75 km/h). The cars imitate real motorcycles, and the riders sit in the same posture as real bikers. =Pneumatic (Compressed Air)= Using the same type of system as a Hydraulic launch, a pneumatic launch uses compressed air to launch the vehicle. The technology was developed by S&S; as the Thrust Air 2000 model. The first coaster of this type was the Hypersonic XLC, opened at Kings Dominion in Doswell, Virginia, USA in 2001. This coaster closed in 2007. Another incarnation, the Ring Racer was open for only 4 days. Compressed air launches are able to provide more acceleration than traditional pneumatic launches, with Do-Dodonpa at Fuji-Q Highland in Japan holding the acceleration record since it opened as Dodonpa in 2001, launching passengers from 0 to 112 mph (180 km/h) in 1.56 seconds. Other styles =Catapult= In the catapult launch, a dropped weight winds a cable to pull the train until it accelerates to its full speed. Dropped weights were used in early installations of Shuttle Loop. These rides are often not very tall, and usually achieve speeds of 60 mph (96 km/h). =Flywheel= Flywheel launches are used on some Anton Schwarzkopf designed shuttle loop coasters and Zamperla Motocoasters. A large flywheel is spun at high speeds and is attached to a cable that propels the train forward. =Electric motor and spring tension= Arrow Dynamics' Launched Loop coasters, which were popular in the 1970s and 1980s, use a powerful electric motor and tensioned springs to propel a launch car forward. The launch car pushes the train outward to a drop, and then returns to its position. After the train reaches the opposite platform, another catch car works the same way. An example of this is Irn Bru Revolution. =Friction wheels= Another type of launch is by friction wheels. The launch track consists of a series of horizontal tires that pinch the brake fins on the underside of the train. One example of this is the Incredible Hulk Coaster at Universal's Islands of Adventure. = Chain = Chain launches are extremely common among roller coasters. A chain-dog attached to a train attaches to the chain, allowing the train to be pulled. Traditionally, chain launches are used to pull a train up large hills. An example of a chain launch is Torando at Bakken in Denmark.

Desert is a large desert in Western Australia. and is still largely in an almost \\"pristine\\" state. It is about in size, making it the fifth largest desert in Australia, after the Great Victoria, Great Sandy, Tanami and Simpson deserts. The Gibson Desert is both an interim Australian bioregion and desert ecoregion. Location and description The Gibson Desert is located between the saline Lake Disappointment and Lake Macdonald along the Tropic of Capricorn, south of the Great Sandy Desert, east of the Little Sandy Desert, and north of the Great Victoria Desert. The altitude rises to just above in places. As noted by early Australian explorers such as Ernest Giles large portions of the desert are characterized by gravel-covered terrains covered in thin desert grasses and it also contains extensive areas of undulating red sand plains and dunefields, low rocky/gravelly ridges and substantial upland portions with a high degree of laterite formation. The sandy soil of the lateritic buckshot plains is rich in iron. Several isolated salt-water lakes occur in the centre of the region and to the southwest a system of small lakes follow paleo-drainage features. Groundwater sources include portions of the Officer Basin and Canning Basin. Climate Rainfall in the Gibson Desert ranges from annually, while evaporation rates are in the range of per year. The climate is generally hot; summer maximum temperatures rise above whilst in winter the maximum may fall to and minimum winter temperatures dip to .Great Victoria and Gibson Deserts, Western Australia from Climate and Weather Atlas of Australia by Michael Thompson, verified 2006-01-23. Name The Gibson Desert was named by explorer Ernest Giles after a member of his party, Alfred Gibson, who became lost and presumably died in this desert during an expedition in 1874. Indigenous habitation In much of the region, especially the drier western portion, the majority of people living in the area are Indigenous Australians. In 1984, due to a severe drought which had dried up all of the springs and depleted the bush foods, a group of the Pintupi people who were living a traditional semi-nomadic desert-dwelling life, walked out of a remote wilderness in the central-eastern portion of the Gibson Desert (northeast of Warburton) and made contact for the first time with mainstream Australian society. They are believed to have been perhaps the last uncontacted tribe in Australia. On the eastern margin of the region, population centres (which include people of European descent) include Warburton, Mantamaru and Warakurna. Young Indigenous adults from the Gibson Desert region work in the Wilurarra Creative programs to maintain and develop their culture.Wilurarra Creative See also * Deserts of Australia * List of deserts by area * Carnegie expedition of 1896 External links * Gibson Desert 1997; a photo album of the Gibson Desert by Stuart Jackson, Verified 2006-01-23 *Across Australia Motorbike Tour References Further reading * Thackway, R and I D Cresswell (1995) An interim biogeographic regionalisation for Australia : a framework for setting priorities in the National Reserves System Cooperative Program Version 4.0 Canberra : Australian Nature Conservation Agency, Reserve Systems Unit, 1995.

The Liberators were led through most of their short existence by Charles Koen, who went on to organize a nationally noted civil-rights campaign in Cairo, Illinois. The organization was strongly inspired by the Black Panther Party which had established a firm base in the neighboring city of Chicago, adopting the party military-style uniforms, radical rhetoric, and black self-determination. The group was formally established in the summer of 1968 by veteran St. Louis civil rights activist Charles Koen opening a formal headquarters in 2810 Easton in the St. Louis downtown. Just as the Black Panthers had adopted a Ten-Point Program, the Black Liberators adopted a five-point programme: #That we be given a chance to prove ourselves as other men have done. #That we gain enough living space to find ourselves and prove ourselves as full-fledged citizens. #That we plan to do for ourselves in all areas of human living. #That we move out and up into human dignity. #That we have sufficient funds to carry our creativity to fruition. On August 17, 1969 the Black Liberators served as protection for African-American Congressman Adam Clayton Powell Jr. who represented the historically black Harlem district. The following month the 9th Precinct of the Saint Louis Police Department was shot at by an unknown assailant and an African American member of the police board had his real estate office firebombed, the metropolitan police suspected the Liberators. Following these events the Black Liberator headquarters was substantially damaged, according to witnesses, by plainclothes police officers. Matters escalated when, eight days later police arrested Charles Koen and Leon Dent for carrying a concealed weapon during a traffic stop, which was later determined was a comb. Following the arrest, Koen and Dent would receive strong public support from groups such as International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 688, NAACP, and St. Louis Argus. In response to the arrest, the Liberators voted in favor of Yusuf Shabazz to succeed Koen as prime minister of the group, resulting in the decline and eventual end of the group. Nine months following his inauguration, Shabazz was arrested for mail fraud, during court proceedings it was revealed that Shabazz had been operating as an informant for the metropolitan police.

The sequel to Sonic Drift, it was released in Japan and Europe in March 1995 and in North America in November 1995. It added three characters: Knuckles, Fang the Sniper, and Metal Sonic, and marked the first time the last two were playable characters. Gameplay The player as Metal Sonic in a race with Knuckles the Echidna, Fang the Sniper, and Dr. Eggman. The gameplay is similar to Sonic Drift, but with minor changes. In the Chaos GP mode, players are awarded with Chaos Emeralds should they come in 1st within a GP. Alongside Sonic, Tails, Amy, and Dr. Eggman, there are three additional playable characters: Metal Sonic, Fang, and Knuckles. Metal Sonic drives the Blue Devil, a convertible sports car with high speed and bad handling. His special ability is the High-Speed Dash, but unlike Sonic's High- Speed Dash, it requires 3 rings to use and is much more powerful. Fang drives the Marvelous Queen, a modified airbike with good speed and acceleration, but has poor handling. He also tosses Oil Balls that make opponents spin out after a while. Knuckles drives the Tempest, a car based on the Hummer H1 that has balanced stats. Unlike most characters, Knuckles has two abilities in the game. He can punch nearby racers to make them spin out and drop a ring, but if there are none nearby, he will jump. Reception Like its predecessor, Sonic Drift 2 was met with mixed to negative reviews from critics. On release, Famicom Ts≈´shin scored the game a 19 out of 40.NEW GAMES CROSS REVIEW: „ÇΩ„Éã„ÉÉ„ÇØ„Éâ„É™„Éï„Éà2. Weekly Famicom Ts≈´shin. No.327. Pg.41. 24 March 1995.

The Brazil socio-geographic division is a slightly different division than the Brazilian Division by Regions. It separates the country into three different and distinctive regions: *Amaz√¥nia Legal *Centro-Sul *Nordeste Historically, the different regions of Brazil had their own migratory movements, which resulted in racial differences between these areas. The Southern region had a greater impact of the European immigration and has a large White majority, which contrasts with the Northern and Northeastern regions, which have a large Pardo (mixed-race) majority.Frequency of Continent-Specific mtDNA Haplotypes in the Brazilian mtDNA Pool In Northern Brazil, the main racial contribution was of the native Amerindians, with a smaller European and African influence. In Northeastern Brazil, the main contribution was of Africans, with a smaller European and Amerindian influence. In Southeastern Brazil, the main contribution was of Europeans, with a smaller African and Amerindian influence.  Socio- geographic distinction  This does not separate the country by borders of states. The north of Minas Gerais, for example, is in the socio-geographic division of Nordeste, but its southern part is in Centro-Sul. However, it is not very used, mainly because it is unofficial; all official information by IBGE is listed by the criteria of regions. The division by Socio-Geographic similarities is used mainly in universities and private companies, and it is little mentioned at regular school (grades 6-10).  Regions  =South= The South of Brazil is the region with the largest percentage of Whites. According to the 2005 census, people of European ancestry account for 79.6% of the population. In colonial times, this region had a very small population. The region what is now Southern Brazil was originally settled by Amerindian peoples, mostly Guarani and Kaingangs.P√°gina do Ga√∫cho ‚Äì √çndios ‚Äì Os grupos ind√≠genas e sua distribui√ß√£o Only a few settlers from S√£o Paulo were living there. This situation made the region vulnerable to attacks from neighboring countries. This fact forced the King of Portugal to decide to populate the region. For this, settlers from the Portuguese Azores islands were sent to the coast. To stimulate the immigration to Brazil, the king offered several benefits for the Azorean couples. Between 1748 and 1756, six thousand Portuguese from the Azores moved to the coast of Santa Catarina. They were mainly newly married who were seeking a better life. At that time, the Azores were one of the poorest regions of Portugal. They established themselves mainly in the Santa Catarina Island, nowadays the region of Florian√≥polis. Later, some couples moved to Rio Grande do Sul, where they established Porto Alegre, the capital. The Azoreans lived on fishing and agriculture, especially flour. They composed over half of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina's population in the late 18th century.Imigrantes: A√ßorianos The state of Paran√° was settled by colonists from S√£o Paulo due to their proximity (Paran√° was part of S√£o Paulo until the mid-19th century). With the development of cattle in the interior of Rio Grande do Sul, African slaves began arriving in large numbers. By 1822, Blacks were 50% of Rio Grande do Sul's population. This number decreased to 25% in 1858 and to only 5.2% in 2005. Most of them came from Angola.RS VIRTUAL ‚Äì O Rio Grande do Sul na Internet ‚Äì Hist√≥ria ‚Äì Coloniza√ß√£o ‚Äì Negros ‚Äì A hist√≥ria dos ga√∫chos sem hist√≥ria After independence from Portugal (1822) the Brazilian government started to stimulate the arrival of a new wave of immigrants to settle the South. In 1824 they established S√£o Leopoldo, a German community. Major Schaeffer, a German who was living in Brazil, was sent to Germany in order to bring immigrants. From Rhineland- Palatinate, the Major brought the immigrants and soldiers. Settlers from Germany were brought to work as small farmers, because there were many land holdings without workers. To attract the immigrants, the Brazilian government had promised large tracts of land, where they could settle with their families and colonize the region. The first years were not easy. Many Germans died of tropical disease, while others left the colonies to find better living conditions. The German colony of S√£o Leopoldo was a disaster. Nevertheless, in the following years, a further 4,830 Germans arrived at S√£o Leopoldo, and then the colony started to develop, with the immigrants establishing the town of Novo Hamburgo (New Hamburg). From S√£o Leopoldo and Novo Hamburgo, the German immigrants spread into others areas of Rio Grande do Sul, mainly close to sources of rivers. The whole region of Vale dos Sinos was populated by Germans. During the 1830s and part of the 1840s German immigration to Brazil was interrupted due to conflicts in the country (Ragamuffin War). The immigration restarted after 1845 with the creation of new colonies. The most important ones were Blumenau, in 1850, and Joinville in 1851, both in Santa Catarina state; these attracted thousands of German immigrants to the region. In the next five decades, other 28 thousand Germans were brought to Rio Grande do Sul to work as small farmers in the countryside.Germans Until 1914, it is estimated that 50 thousand Germans settled in this state. Another immigration boom to this region started in 1875. Communities with Italian immigrants were also created in southern Brazil. The first colonies to be populated by Italians were created in the highlands of Rio Grande do Sul (Serra Ga√∫cha). These were Garibaldi and Bento Gon√ßalves. These immigrants were predominantly from Veneto, in northern Italy. After five years, in 1880, the great numbers of Italian immigrants arriving caused the Brazilian government to create another Italian colony, Caxias do Sul. After initially settling in the government-promoted colonies, many of the Italian immigrants spread themselves into other areas of Rio Grande do Sul seeking further opportunities. They created many other Italian colonies on their own, mainly in highlands, because the lowlands were already populated by Germans and native ga√∫chos. The Italian established many vineyards in the region. Nowadays, the wine produced in these areas of Italian colonization in southern Brazil is much appreciated within the country, though little is available for export. In 1875, the first Italian colonies were established in Santa Catarina, which lies immediately to the north of Rio Grande do Sul. The colonies gave rise to towns such as Crici√∫ma, and later also spread further north, to Paran√°. A significant number of Poles have settled in Southern Brazil. The first immigrants arrived in 1869 and until 1959, it is estimated that over 100,000 Poles migrated to Brazil,Uma hist√≥ria oculta: a imigra√ß√£o dos pa√≠ses da Europa do Centro-Leste para o Brasil 95% of whom were peasants. The State of Paran√° received the majority of Polish immigrants, who settled mainly in the region of Curitiba, in the towns of Mallet, Cruz Machado, S√£o Matheus do Sul, Irati, and Uni√£o da Vit√≥ria. Russians and Ukrainians are present as well. =Southeast= The Southeastern region of Brazil is the ethnically most diverse part of the country. Whites make up 58.8% of its population, and those of mixed-race and African descent make up, together, 40.2%. It has the largest percentage of Asian Brazilians, composing 0.8%, and small Amerindian community (0.2%). Southeast Brazil is home to the oldest Portuguese village in the Americas, S√£o Vicente, S√£o Paulo, established in 1532.RankBrasil ‚Äì Livro Dos Recordes Brasileiros ‚Äì Os melhores e maiores do Brasil The region, since the beginning of its colonization, is a melting pot of Whites, Indians and Blacks. The Amerindians of the region were enslaved by the Portuguese. The race mixing between the Indian females and their White masters produced the Bandeirante, the colonial inhabitant of S√£o Paulo, who formed expeditions that crossed the interior of Brazil and greatly increased the Portuguese colonial territory. The main language spoken by these people of mixed Indian/Portuguese heritage was L√≠ngua geral, a language that mixed Tupi and Portuguese words. In the late 17th century the Bandeirantes found gold in the area that nowadays is Minas Gerais. A gold rush took place in Brazil, and thousands of Portuguese colonists arrived during this period. The confrontation between the Bandeirantes and the Portuguese for obtaining possession of the mines led to the Emboabas' War. The Portuguese won the war. The Amerindian culture declined, giving space to a stronger Portuguese cultural domination. In order to control the richness, the Portuguese Crown moved the capital of Brazil from Salvador, Bahia to Rio de Janeiro. Thousands of African slaves were brought to work in the gold mines. They were landed in Rio de Janeiro and sent to other regions. By the late 18th century, Rio de Janeiro was an \\"African city\\": most of its inhabitants were slaves. No other place in the world had so many slaves, since the end of the Roman Empire.Pdt ‚Äì Rj In 1808 the Portuguese Royal Family, fleeing from Napoleon, took charge in Rio de Janeiro. Some 15 thousand Portuguese nobles moved to Brazil. The region changed a lot, becoming more European. After independence and principally after 1850, Southeast Brazil was \\"inundated\\" by European immigrants, who were attracted by the government to replace the African slaves in the coffee plantations. Most immigrants landed in the Port of Santos and have been forwarded to the coffee farms within S√£o Paulo. The vast majority of the immigrants came from Italy. Brazil attracted nearly 5 million immigrants between 1870 and 1953. A large numbers of Italians are apparent in many parts of Southeast Brazil. Their descendants are nowadays predominant in many areas. Northeast S√£o Paulo is 65% Italian, for example.Funda√ß√£o Lorenzato The arrival of immigrants from several places of Europe, the Middle-East and Asia produced an ethnically diverse population. The city of Bastos, in S√£o Paulo, is 11.4% Japanese. The city of S√£o Paulo is home to the largest Japanese population outside Japan itself. S√£o Paulo √© tudo de bom ‚Äì Turismo, eventos e entretenimento na cidade de S√£o Paulo =Northeast= The population of Northeast Brazil is a result of an intensive race mixing, which has occurred in the region for more than four centuries. According to the 2006 census people reported as \\"brown\\" make up 62.5% of the population. Those reported as Black account for 7.8%. This region did not have much effect from the massive European immigration that took place in Southern Brazil in the late 19th century and first decades of the 20th century. The Northeast has been a poorer region of Brazil since the decline of sugar cane plantations in the late 17th century, so its economy did not require immigrants. The ethnic composition of the population starts in the 16th century. The Portuguese settlers rarely brought women, which led to relationships with the Indian women. Later, interracial relationships occurred between Portuguese and African females. The coast, in the past the place where millions of Black slaves arrived (mostly from modern-day Angola, Ghana, Nigeria and Benin) to work in sugar-cane plantations, is where nowadays there is a predominance of Mulattoes, those of Black and White ancestry. Salvador, Bahia is considered the largest Black city outside of Africa, with over 80% of its inhabitants being African-Brazilians. In the interior, there is a predominance of Indian and White mixture.Regi√µes do Brasil =North= Northern Brazil, largely covered by the Amazon rainforest, is the Brazilian region with the largest Amerindian influences, both in culture and ethnicity. Inhabited by diverse indigenous tribes, this part of Brazil was reached by Portuguese and Spanish colonists in the 17th century, but it started to be populated by non-Indians only in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The exploitation of rubber used in the growing industries of automobiles, has emerged a huge migration to the region. Many people from the poor Northeast Brazil, mostly Cear√°, moved to the Amazon area. The contact between the Indians and the northeastern rubbers created the base of the ethnic composition of the region, with its mixed-race majority. =Central-West= The Central-West region of Brazil was inhabited by diverse Indians when the Portuguese arrived in the early 18th century. The Portuguese came to explore the precious stones that were found there. Contact between the Portuguese and the Indians created a mixed-race population. Until the mid-20th century, Central-West Brazil had a very small population. The situation changed with the construction of Brasilia, the new capital of Brazil, in 1960. Many workers were attracted to the region, mostly from northeastern Brazil. A new wave of settlers started arriving from the 1970s. With the mechanization of agriculture in the South of Brazil, many rural workers of German and Italian origin migrated to Central-West Brazil. In some areas, they are already the majority of the population.

History Massachusetts was founded by Puritans who did not accept such aspects of the Church of England as bishops and the Book of Common Prayer. The first Anglican parish in the Massachusetts Bay Colony was King's Chapel in Boston, founded in 1688, 58 years after the city. After the American Revolution, King's Chapel became the first Unitarian congregation in North America. The oldest remaining parishes in the diocese are Christ Church in Quincy, founded in 1704, St. Paul's in Newburyport, founded as Queen Anne's Chapel in 1711, St. Michael's Church in Marblehead, founded in 1714, Christ Church in Boston (Old North Church), founded in 1723, and St. Andrew's Church in South Scituate (now Hanover), founded in 1727. The diocese was organized in 1784, five years before the Episcopal Church itself. The first bishop (for New England and New York) was Samuel Seabury who was consecrated by the bishops of the Scottish Episcopal Church in 1784. Today, it is one of the largest dioceses in the ECUSA in terms of membership. It encompasses the eastern part of Massachusetts, specifically, the nine counties east and southeast of Worcester County. The diocese was the first in the Anglican Communion to consecrate a woman as a bishop. Barbara Harris became bishop suffragan of the diocese in 1989. It became the first diocese in the Episcopal Church to install an African American as diocesan bishop when John Melville Burgess was consecrated as the 12th bishop in 1970. The current diocesan bishop is Alan M. Gates. He was consecrated bishop in 2014 and succeeded M. Thomas Shaw upon the latter's retirement in September 2014. The current bishop suffragan is Gayle E. Harris, consecrated in January 2003. Historically, the diocese has been considered Low Church; however, there are a number of Anglo-Catholic parishes, the most notable of which is the Church of the Advent in Boston. Its best-known Low Church parish is Trinity Church in Boston's Copley Square. However, Trinity and most other parishes in the diocese have become 'higher' in the last 25 years with the introduction of Mass vestments such as the chasuble. Earlier distinctions between Low and High Church have largely disappeared across every diocese. * The see city is Boston. * Episcopal Divinity School was located in the diocese from its formation in 1974 until moving to New York City in 2017.

In 2000, it was the second largest e-commerce company in the country. Bic Camera acquired a majority stake in Sofmap in 2006, and turned it into a wholly owned subsidiary in January 2010. Formerly listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange under the code 2690, Sofmap was delisted on 26 January 2010 after the transaction was completed. As of 2018, Sofmap has 21 stores in 16 districts, mainly in Tokyo and Akihabara. History Sofbank was established by in 1982 as a membership-based software rental business in Shinjuku, followed by branches in Kanda, Akihabara, and Shibuya, as well as franchise stores in Hiyoshi and Kawasaki in the Kanagawa Prefecture. In 1984, Sofmap expanded its business to new and used PC hardware, as well as Nintendo Family Computer and PC software sales. A year later, the software rental business was discontinued after it was declared illegal by the Japanese government. At the beginning of their hardware sales, Sofmap specialized in \\"box sales\\", where it set up shops at small-sized commercial buildings in Akihabara and Osaka/Nipponbashi and sold computers at low prices. In 1986, the company published a free publication titled , which listed computer products and prices. To differentiate themselves from other PC stores, Sofmap introduced their warranty system: five years for new computers and three years for used computers. In anticipation of the PC boom that started with the release of Windows 95, Sofmap increased its floor space and focused on display sales for new PC users. However, during the mid-1990s, sales declined due to a combination of factors such as falling prices of personal computers, reduced distribution and profitability due to shortened product cycles of used products, and sluggish sales of home video games. In 1997, amidst rumors of the company filing for bankruptcy, Sofbank was purchased by Marubeni. In 2000, Suzuki retired and was replaced by . The sofmap.com website was also established that year. In 2005, Marubeni partially transferred its shares of Sofbank to Bic Camera, with Bic owning 61.56% of Sofbank by 2006. On January 29, 2010, Sofmap became a wholly owned subsidiary of Bic Camera. On March 1, 2012, the retail division was split and Sofmap Co., Ltd. was established, and the remaining store real estate management division was merged into Bic Camera.

The current honour was created in 1922 to replace the original medal, which had been established in 1917 as part of the Order of the British Empire. Award The British Empire Medal is granted in recognition of meritorious civil or military service. Recipients are entitled to use the post-nominal letters \\"BEM\\". The honour is divided into civil and military medals in a similar way to the Order of the British Empire itself. Like the ribbons used for other classes of the Order of the British Empire, the ribbon of the British Empire Medal is rose-pink with pearl-grey edges, with the addition of a pearl-grey central stripe for the military division. While recipients are not technically counted as members of the Order, these medals are nevertheless affiliated with it. Between 1993 and 2012, the British Empire Medal was not awarded to subjects of the United Kingdom, although it continued to be awarded in some Commonwealth realms during that time. The practice of awarding the British Empire Medal to subjects of the United Kingdom was resumed in June 2012, to coincide with the Queen's Diamond Jubilee,Second Report on Operation of the Reformed Honours System, The Cabinet Office, 12 December 2011, pp.3‚Äì4 although only in the civil division. History =1917‚Äì22= The Medal of the Order of the British Empire was first established in 1917, along with the Order of the British Empire. The medal was part of the Order and could be awarded for either meritorious service or for gallantry. It was awarded to 2,015 people, 800 of whom were from foreign countries. =1922‚Äì40= In 1922, the original medal was discontinued and split into two separate honours, which still formed part of the Order of the British Empire. These two honours were known as the Medal of the Order of the British Empire for Meritorious Service (usually referred to as British Empire Medal, BEM) and the Medal of the Order of the British Empire for Gallantry (usually referred to as Empire Gallantry Medal, EGM). Of these medals, the EGM was awarded for acts of bravery, until it was replaced by the George Cross in 1940. The BEM was awarded in similar circumstances as the lower classes of the Order of the British Empire, but usually to people below management or professional level. In the uniformed services, it was awarded to non-commissioned officers of the armed forces, officers below superintendent rank in the police, and personnel below divisional officer level in the fire services. =1940‚Äì92= On 24 September 1940, the George Cross was established and the EGM was revoked by Royal Warrant from the same day. All living recipients, other than honorary recipients, and the next-of-kin of recipients who had been posthumously awarded the EGM after 3 September 1939, the start of the Second World War, were to exchange their insignia for the George Cross. Recipients of the BEM were not affected by these changes. The BEM was instituted in 1917 was for meritorious service but from the beginning some awards were for acts of gallantry. There were an increased number of cases in the Second World War for service personnel and civilians including the merchant marine, police and emergency services and civil defence. From 1940, the BEM was awarded for acts of gallantry that did not reach the standard of the George Medal. Such awards often had citations, some detailed and graphic while awards for meritorious service usually appeared without a citation. From 14 January 1958, awards of the BEM made for acts of gallantry were formally designated the British Empire Medal for Gallantry and consisted of the BEM with a silver oak leaf emblem worn on the ribbon. The first recipients of this newly designated award were two Board of Customs officers, George Elrick Thomson and John Rees Thomas, who ventured into a burning steamship hold in an attempt to rescue a colleague. Like the GM, the BEM for Gallantry could not be awarded posthumously and was eventually replaced in 1974 with the Queen's Gallantry Medal (QGM). Again, recipients of the BEM for services other than acts of bravery were not affected by these changes. =1992‚Äì2012= The BEM continued to be awarded to subjects of the United Kingdom until 1992. Those awarded the honour did not receive it from the monarch in person, but from the Lord Lieutenant of their county, or from a local authority. After a 1993 review of the British honours system, the government decided that the distinction between the BEM and MBE had \\"become increasingly tenuous\\" and the Prime Minister, John Major, expressed a view that he wanted more local people to receive their awards from the Queen herself. While awards of the BEM therefore ceased to be made to subjects of the United Kingdom, the medal continued to be awarded in the Commonwealth realms, such as the Bahamas and the Cook Islands.See the 2008 New Year () and Queen's Birthday Honours () =From 2012= Following the 2011 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, Prime Minister David Cameron announced that the BEM would once again be awarded in the United Kingdom, although only in the civil division; this would start beginning in 2012, to coincide with the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. In the 2012 Birthday Honours, released on 16 June 2012, the BEM was awarded to 293 people.

In the late 90s he became famed as 'a man who would do anything to win a bet'. His most famous wager was in 1996 when he agreed to receive breast implants and keep them for one year in return for US$100,000 (US$ in ). The year passed and he won the bet but he became accustomed to the breasts and did not have them removed. Biography =Early life= Zembic was born 1961 in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. =The Breast bet= alt=subpectoral breast implant In the summer of 1996 Zembic was gambling in a high-stakes game when the conversation turned to women's breast implants. One of his friends, another gambler named Jobo, had the opinion that having implants in order to attract men was a crazy thing to do. Zembic disagreed and said that it was not a serious event and that the consequences were small. An argument ensued and the two agreed that they would enter into a wager where Zembic would receive breast implants and if he kept them in for a year he would win US$100,000 (US$ in ). The two established a contract to work out the details. Brian would pay for the operation to have 38C implants placed under his pec muscles. Jobo placed the money with a third party to guarantee payment if Zembic won the bet. For a few months in 1996 he didn't follow through with the wager but in the fall of 1996 Zembic lost a large amount of money playing the stock market and sought out a surgeon to go through with the procedure in order to win the $100,000 prize to cover his losses. Through his gambling contacts he found a cosmetic surgeon who was also a gambler and after a few games of backgammon Zembic was able to get the $4,500 surgery in exchange for forgiving the doctor's debt. In October 1996 Zembic underwent the breast augmentation surgery in New York City. Jobo upon hearing that Zembic had undergone surgery offered to buy out the bet by paying $50,000 to cancel the wager but Zembic refused and said he would see the wager through for the full year and full $100,000. In October 1997 he fulfilled the arrangements of the bet and Jobo deposited the full $100,000 into a Swiss bank account. After the one-year mark passed he became a celebrity of sorts because of the wager. In 1999, his tale was the title feature in a book of short stories called The man with the $100,000 breasts and other gambling stories.\\\\- Total pages: 234 =Other wagers= Although Zembic is a notorious gambler, he claims the 'breast bet' remains the most stupid he has ever accepted. He has taken part in other wagers, including one for $14,000 when he lived in a bathroom for a week before the people he took the bet with bought him out for $7,000. He once played famous poker player Doyle Brunson in a ping pong game where the winner, Zembic, took $14,000. On another bet he slept the night in New York's Central Park with $20,000 on his person.

Fox Searchlight Pictures bought the rights to his story. The script has been completed and various stars have been attached like Drew Carey and David Duchovny. Zembic says part of the reason he hasn't had the implants removed is that \\"... every year when they renewed the rights, they kept saying, 'Keep the tits so you can appear at the end of the movie. It'll be really cool.'\\" But David Higgins the producer attached to the film says, \\"I'm not insisting that he keep his implants in; it's completely up to him,\\" he says. \\"It would be great for marketing, of course, but we can always find another way.\\" Family In 2000 Zembic fathered a daughter, Mika with his then-wife. When asked about her father's mammaries Mika said, \\"I know why you have boobs: Uncle Mike paid you money to put them in.\\" In a 2006 interview he said that Mika was one of the few reasons he would have the implants taken out: if they caused her to be bullied in school, he would have them removed.
